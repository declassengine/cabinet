Sir,Air Ministry, London, S.W. 1,May 28, 1942.I HAVE the honour to forward my despatch on the Far East, covering the period from the 17th October 1940 to the 27th December, 1941.In preparing this despatch, I have been handicapped in that no member ofmy staff is in the United Kingdom, and that I brought no documents away from singapore except a few personal papers.Of the Commanders serving under me at the start of the war with Japan,I have only been able to consult Lieutenant-General Sir Kenneth McLeod.All Government Departments concerned have been most helpful in supplyingdocuments and obtaining information, and I have verified statements of fact asfar as possible; but I have had to rely largely on my own memory with regard to matters that should be included in the despatch; hence there are likely to beomissions, and possibly some lack of balance.In the sections dealing with the operations, .some places are mentioned thatare not on any of the maps referred to at the end of the Table of Contents.These will only be found on large-scale maps printed in Malaya or Hong kong and not readily accessible.I have the honour to be,Sir,(Signed)Your obedient servant,d) R.

DESPATCH ON THE EAR EAST.By Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, G.C.V.O., K.C.B.,C.M.G.. D.S.O., A.F.C.I.-FORMATION OF GENERAL HEADQUARTERS, FAR EAST.THIS despatch covers the period from the date of my appointment as commander-in-Chief, Far East, the 17th October, 1940, to the date on which Ihanded over to Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Pownall, the 27th December, 1941.My original staff consisted of seven, exclusive of my personal assistant. Ofthese seven, the Chief of Staff, Major-General Dewing, the Senior Royal AirForce Staff Officer, Group-Captain Darvall, as well as my personal assistant,travelled out with me.The Naval Liaison Officer, Captain Back, met me on my arrival at Singapore,and the Army G.S.O. 1, Colonel Fawcett, met me in Burma.Before leaving England I saw the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Chiefof the Air Staff and Major-General Ismay individually, but did not meet theChiefs of Staff collectively at one of their meetings.2. I left London on Sunday, the 27th October, and started by air fromPlymouth on the 28th October. I spent two clear days in Cairo, three in Delhiand three in Rangoon, arriving at Singapore on Thursday, the 14th November.General Headquarters, Far East, started to operate on Monday, the18th November, 1940.During the journey I was able to see the working of the Headquarters of boththe Army and Air Force in Cairo, and to consult with the Commander-in-Chief,Sir Archibald Wavell, on the methods of operating his headquarters, andespecially why he found such a big expansion from his original staff necessary.At Delhi I stayed with the Viceroy, and established contact with theCommander-in-Chief, the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, and their respectivestaffs, and with certain civil officials.At Rangoon I stayed with the Governor, Sir Archibald Cochrane, and reached agreement over the constitutional problems raised by the appointment ofa Commander-in-Chief, Far East. I met the General Officer Commanding,Major-General (now Lieutenant-General Sir K.) McLeod, visited various estab-lishments, including the oil refinery at Syriam, and established contact with manyof the civil officials.Instructions and General Policy.&apos;3.   My Directive is given in Appendix A.On my arrival in Singapore it was agreed that, should I become a casualty,the Commander-in-Chief, China Station, should take my place until my successorwas appointed.With reference to paragraph 2 of my Directive, the meaning of the term&quot; operational control&quot; was explained in two signals from England. (SeeAppendix B.)In addition to this Directive, I had two main guides for action : first, that itwas the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to avoid war with Japan, and,secondly, that, until a fleet was available, our policy in the Far East should be to rely primarily on air power in conjunction with such naval forces as could bemade available. The first was confirmed during 1941 in many telegrams, e.g., inMarch, &quot; Avoidance of war with Japan is basis of Far East policy and provoca-tion must be rigidly avoided,&apos;^1) and again in September, &quot;Our policy in theFar East is still to avoid war with Japan.&quot;(]) The second was laid down by theChiefs of Staff in August 1940.(2)4. It was pointed out to me that the requirements of Home Defence,the Battle of the Atlantic, and the Middle East, must take precedence - over(*) X174 of March 4, 1941, from Chiefs of Staff via Air Ministry, paragraph 1, andCCS. F.E. 30 of September 17, 1941, paragraph .1. See also CCS, F.E. 16 of July 21, 1941,paragraph 2, and CCS. 48 of November 29, 1941.(a) CCS. (40) 592 (Revise), August 15, 1940, Annex I, paragraph 62.&apos;
those of the Far East; at a later date Russia also took precedence, and, at onetime, Iraq and Iran. Realising this, it was obviously our duty to be content with the essential minimum, to consider what we could do without rather thanwhat we would like to.have, and to make the fullest use of local resources. Butwe always regarded the strength of 336 aeroplanes as an irreducible minimum.(See -para. 81 below.) In January, 1941 (3). we were cautioned against over-estimate of the Japanese forces.I was also informed that the defence organisation in Malaya was apparentlynot working smoothly or efficiently, especially as regards co-operation betweenthe Army and the Air Force, and on the part of certain civil authorities concerned w7ith defence measures. This would necessitate early investigation and action.5. To carry out the directions outlined above, it was evident that thefollowing steps were necessary : (a) To avoid any action that might be deemed provocative by Japan, butat the same time to try and convince her that our strength was too great to be challenged successfully;(b) To strengthen our defences in the Far East, and especially to buildup our air forces, not only by obtaining new aircraft but also by making all preparations to ensure mutual reinforcement in the far east area;(c) To ensure effective co-operation in Malaya, not only between theRoyal Navy, the Army and the Air Force but also between themand the civil services;(d) To stiffen the Chinese so that they could contain the maximum Japaneseeffort (see paras. 71 and 72 below); and(e) To establish as close co-operation as possible with the Dutch and-&apos; Americans, as well as with Australia and New Zealand, the main object being to ensure that, should an attack be made on any partof the Far East area, all the nations concerned would simultaneouslyenter the war against Japan, thus avoiding the risk of defeat indetail, as had happened&apos; in Europe.6. A very brief study of the area comprised in the Far East Commandshows that the defence of the whole area is essentially one single problem.Burma, Siam, Indo-China, Malaya, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies,Australia and, to a lesser extent, New Zealand, all inter-connect and operations or preparations in any one of these areas affect all the others. In view ofthe above, I regarded it as one of my principal duties to make personal contactsin these places. During 1941 I visited Australia twice, in February and october, Manila three times and the Netherlands East Indies five times. I alsovisited Hong Kong in December 1940 and April 1941; and Burma in June and september 1941.Another point that stands out is that the problem is fundamentally a navalone, and that, although the Army and Air Force in combination may defendareas of land and repel an enemy, his definite defeat cannot be brought aboutunless control of sea communications is obtained. This control will necessitateair superiority.The Far East is usually examined on a small-scale map, so people arerather apt to get a false idea of distances. From Singapore to Alor Star atthe North end of Malaya is a good deal farther than from London to Aberdeen.Rangoon to Singapore direct by air is about 1,100 miles; Singapore to HongKong, via Manila, is 2,000 miles, about the distance from Gibraltar to alexandria; and from Singapore to Melbourne about 4,100, which is only slightly less than the distance from London to Aden, via Malta and Cairo.Size of General Headquarters Staff.7. Although it was obvious that Singapore was a key position, andtherefore that the defence of Malaya was of the greatest importance, it was evident that, apart from my Directive, the size of my Staff rendered it quite impossible to exercise any form of direct operational control, except in the widest sense. I therefore decided that, although the fact of my headquarters(&apos;) C.O.S. No. 39 of January 10, 1941, paragraphs 3 and 15.
happening to be situated at Singapore would naturally involve my dealing with more details in Malaya than elsewhere, the Commands of Hong Kong, malaya and Burma must be regarded as of equal status. Each General OfficerCommanding would have to control the operations in his own area, and theinitiative of the Air Officer Commanding, Far East, must not be cramped; the operational control of my headquarters would be limited mainly to themovement of reinforcements, principally air, within my command and to theigAije of directives.The staff of General Headquarters, Far East, was very small for the work it had to carry out, and immediately on its formation in Singapore it was foundnecessary to add three duty officers of junior rank in order to ensure keeping atwenty-four-hour watch in the office. Bequests for an increase of staff at general Headquarters were made on more than one occasion, and finally it wasagreed by the Chiefs of Staff, in August 1941,0 that tne total establishmentshould be raised to the following : Commander-in-Chief :  1.Chief of Staff: 1.Staff Officer, 1st Grade : Navy 1; Army 2: R.A.F. 2.Staff Officer, 2nd Grade : Navy 1; Army 3; R.A.F. 3.Staff Officer, 3rd Grade : Navy 1.Total, 15.In addition to this, there were : Personal Assistant: 1.Cipher Officers : 2.Signal Officer : 1.Chief Clerk : 1.   .Making a total in all of 20. This establishment was not completed by the timewar broke out.The result of the smallness of the Staff was that individuals were over-worked, and this, in conjunction with the Malayan climate, led to sickness. Themost serious case was that of my Chief of Staff, Major-General Dewing, whowent into hospital on the 8th April, and remained there until he started for england in May. General Playfair arrived to take his place on the 21st June,but for a period of some ten and a half weeks I was without a Chief of Staff.This sickness was largely attributed by the medical authorities to the effects of overwork. In addition, Wing-Commander Yarde had to be sent away sick,other officers were in hospital for shorter periods, and when war with Japanbroke out Colonel Scott, who had taken Colonel Fawcetfs place as the ArmyG.S.0.1, was in India on sick leave, having been, sent there from hospital.Intelligence.8. For intelligence I relied almost entirely on the Far Eastern CombinedBureau, known for short as F.E.C.B. This consisted of branches of Naval, Armyand Air Force intelligence, and was under the administrative control of theAdmiralty, the officer in charge of the Naval Section acting as head of the bureau. At the date of the formation of my headquarters, F.E.C.B., was some-what unbalanced in that attention was mostly concentrated on Naval intelligence,while Army and Air intelligence took a minor place, the latter especially &quot;beingquite inadequate. This, however, was steadily corrected, and I considerthat F.E.C.B. fulfilled its functions and showed that a combined intelligence staffof the three Services is a workable proposition. What was needed, however, wasa real chief of F.E.C.B., and not merely one whose main duty was acting as headof his own branch. The difficulty was in finding a really suitable individual,and this we had not succeeded in doing at the time war with Japan broke out.The weakest part of the intelligence system was the Secret intelligence service. In the Spring of 1941 the different sections of this were working some-what independently, and I was not at all satisfied that they were getting theinformation that was wanted, and that should have been available. Mr. Denhamwas officially appointed to take control of the Secret Intelligence Service, and matters improved considerably after this, but there was too much leeway to make(4) C.O.S. F.E. 28 of August 27, 1941.
up and to have got the Secret Service working satisfactorily improvements shouldhave been started two or three years before. For instance, we never got any information as to what was happening in Camranh Harbour. (See para. 97below.)A ttachments to General Headquarters Staff.9. A branch of the Ministry of Economic Warfare known as the O.M.Section, was started on the arrival of Mr. Killery at Singapore in May 1941. Heand his staff were keen and capable, but they had no experience and very littleknowledge of how to set about their&apos;work. Further, as in the case of intelligence,this is work that requires a great deal of preparation. In consequence of this,but through no fault of Mr. Killery or his staff, the O.M. activities really nevergot functioning properly by the time that war with Japan broke out. Therewas also a curious reluctance on the part of many people to have anything todo with these activities, or to help on the work. This was particularly noticeablein the case of intended activities in Siam.10. Colonel Warren arrived in Singapore early in 1941 to assist in startingIndependent Companies. The obvious disadvantage of these Companies is thatthey form a drain on infantry units, which were already depleted of many oftheir best non-commissioned officers and officers owing to the expansion and demands of other organisations. As a result, it was finally decided to limit theseIndependent Companies to two one for Burma and one for Malaya.- II.-FACTORS AFFECTING THE DEFENCE OF MALAYA ANDBORNEO.11. Air Vice-Marshal Pulford became Air Officer Commanding, Far East,vice Air. Vice-Marshal Babbington on the 26th April, 1941, and lieutenant-General Percival took over the duties of General Officer Commanding,Malaya, from Lieutenant-General Bond on the 16th May, 1941.The strength of the Army and of the Air Force in Malaya in November1940 is given in Appendices E and L respectively.In Malaya, as in Burma and Hong Kong, there was a War Committee, whichsat under the Governor.The main reason for the defence of Malaya was to preserve the facilities ofthe Naval Base at Singapore. The port and rubber and tin production were also important, but on a different plane from the Naval Base. It was, of course, not sufficient to have a close defence of the area round the Naval Base itself. Itwas of great importance to keep enemy aircraft as far away from the Base aspossible, on account of the danger of bombing; this meant extending the defenceright up to the Northern end of Malaya. It may be noted that this was notdependent upon the policy of defending Malaya by means of air power. Had thepolicy been to defend Malaya by means of Army forces, the dispositions mighthave been different, but it would still have been essential to hold the greater-partof Malaya in order to deny aerodromes or their possible sites to the enemy.Singapore Island was to be provisioned for 180 days.Communications.12. The main roads in Malaya are well-metalled, and the railways are single-track metre-gauge. Down the centre of Malaya runs a range of hills rising to some7,000 feet, and there are no east-to-west communications north of latitude 4,i.e., about the latitude of Kuantan. The central backbone of hills dies awaysoon after crossing the frontier with Siam, and good lateral communications wereavailable in the neighbourhood of Singora, where, also, there were suitable sites for aerodromes. Generally speaking, communications in the west are good andon the east poor.The defence of the east coast was simplified by the lack of communications,since it was only necessary to hold those places from which roads ran into theinterior. This meant that the key points to hold were Mersing and Kuantan.Kota Bharu in Kelantan was held because of the aerodrome at that place and two others a few miles further south, these being necessary in order to enable us to strike, with aircraft, as far as possible into the Gulf of Siam and into Indo-China.   (See para. 52 below.)
The only existing land communication between Kelantan and the rest of malaya is the railway, there being no through road. Attempts were made to use the railway for motor transport, but as the rails were spiked and no chairs wereavailable the damage caused to tyres was so excessive that the project was given up as impracticable. This meant that communications with any force atKota Bharu were precarious, since everything had to move by the single line ofrailway, which in many parts was highly vulnerable to bombing. I laid down that the road policy in Kelantan should be not to develop any road on or near the coast, but as soon as practicable to construct an internal road running northand south, following more or less the line of the railway.The only communication overland with Kuantan was a single road,&apos; also veryvulnerable in places to air bombing.Co-operation between the services and tvith the civil authorities.13. For some time before November 1940 the relations between the Armyand the Air Force were not happy; there was some jealousy between them,co-operation left a great deal to be desired, and it was some months before this could be considered at all satisfactory. Every operation should have been looked upon as a combined operation of two, or very often the three, services; for along time there was a tendency for one of the services to work out a plan onits own and then see how one or both the other services could come in.A great step in advance was made by getting the headquarters of the Armyand Air Force on the same site. This entailed a good deal of building, but beforewar started there was a single combined Operations Room functioning and thewhole of the Army General Staff were located on the same site as Royal Air ForceHeadquarters. A naval section joined the Operations Room at the start ofthe war as planned previously.14. The tradition of inter-service jealousy had some effect for the first sixmonths on the working of General Headquarters. Personal relations with theArmy Headquarters were good, but I felt in the early months a reluctance at times to accept advice, and a suspicion that General Headquarters, with a RoyalAir Force officer as Commander-in-Chief, were dealing with matters which wereproperly the functions of the General Officer Commanding.Co-operation between the Navy and Air Force was good, and it continuallyimproved between the Navy and the Army, for instance, on such matters as gettingadvice from naval officers as to the probable sites of landings from the naval pointof view.It might be mentioned here that both in the Philippines and in theNetherlands East Indies there was noticeable lack of co-operation between theArmy and the Navy, and this gave cause for some anxiety. It was not that thetwo services actually quarrelled, but there seemed to be a failure to appreciate the fact that they were bound to be closely connected in any operation. In both cases improvement had been effected before war broke out, especially in the caseof the Netherlands East Indies.15. Relations between the Commander-in-Chief, China, and myself wereclose and friendly throughout. Our offices were adjoining after the move of myheadquarters to the Naval Base and I had luncheon with him in his house nearly every day.Relations between the commanders in Malaya and the Governor were good.I always found the Governor ready to help, and our personal relations were very friendly.As regards the Colonial Service generally, our relations in most cases were satisfactory, and much help was received from many Departments, especially the Survey and the Government Posts and Telegraphs. But sometimes there seemed to be undue procrastination and a tendency to avoid action so as toensure making no mistake. It was also often difficult to get full and accurate information. I feel that it would be of great value to the Colonial Service ifits officers could attend some college on the lines of the Military Staff Collegesat some time in their career; one of the first steps might be imbuing them witha passion for accuracy and the determination to get things done.
There was an interchange of liaison officers with the Dutch, first Navy andAir and later Army as well. Observers from the American Army and Navywere also posted to Singapore.Borneo.16. Unless we obtained command of the sea, it was impossible to defendBritish Borneo as a whole with the forces available. But through communications in the island were practically non-existent; consequently, any defence could belimited to holding the important points. The only place which it was decided tohold was Kuching, the reason for this being not only that there was an aerodrome at that place, but that its occupation by the enemy might give access to the aerodromes in Dutch Borneo at the North-Western end of the island, theseaerodromes being only some 350 miles from Singapore, i.e., much nearer than anyin South Indo-China.I informed the Governor of North Borneo that his territory could not be defended, and that the volunteers and police at his disposal were to be utilised for purposes of internal security. No attempt was made to defend Labuan,though it was a cable and wireless station.The State of Brunei was of some importance owing to the oilfield at Seriain the South, which, in addition to Miri, supplied crude oil to the refineries atLutong in Sarawak. Although one company of the 2nd/15th Punjabis, less oneplatoon to Kuching, had been moved to Lutong in December 1940, and two 6-inch guns had been mounted there, it was finally decided that it was useless to attemptto defend the refinery or either of the oilfields. Consequently, a partial denialscheme was carried out before war broke out, whereby the oil output was reducedby some 70 per cent., and only a small number of items were left to complete the denial scheme when war broke out. According to reports, the work was completedsatisfactorily.The 2nd/15th Punjabis, less the one company referred to above, leftSingapore for Kuching on the 10th and 11th May, 1941. Steps were also takento develop local forces, i.e., volunteers and a body of native troops known as theSarawak Rangers.III.-FACTORS AFFECTING THE DEFENCE OF BURMA.A uthorities.17. Sir Reginald Dorman Smith replaced the Hon. Sir Archibald Cochraneas Governor of Burma on the 6th May, 1941, and Lieut.-General Hutton took over the duties of General Officer Commanding from Lieut.-General McLeodat midnight the 28th/29th December 1941.The War Committee in Burma included Burmese Ministers as well as thetwo British Counsellors and the General Officer Commanding. The Governor wasPresident and the Premier of Burma Vice-President.Sir R. Dorman Smith established a military liaison officer on his personalstaff. There were obvious advantages in this, and it would doubtless have worked well had the facts and figures always been obtained from the. responsibleauthorities. As it was, information was sometimes sought through other channels,with the result that at times inaccurate or incomplete information was given tothe Governor, leading to misunderstandings.Communications.18. The main factor affecting the defence of Burma was that of communications. The total length of frontier facing Japanese-occupied territory in December 1941, was nearly 800 miles. There were good roads, as well asrailways, running north and south up the valleys of the Sittang and Irrawaddy.Roads in the Tenasserim Peninsula were bad.Working north from the southern end of the Tenasserim Peninsula, therewere only mountain tracks leading eastwards from Siam until reaching the road from Raheng through Mesod towards Moulmein, which crossed the Burmafrontier at Myawadi. Even this road was not continuous, and there was a sectionof fifty miles reported to be not much better than a pack track. From theJapanese point of view, it had the disadvantages that we should be able to
operate from close to our railhead at Martaban, and that, so long as we heldcommand of the sea, advance beyond Moulmein by the Japanese would be opento a British flank attack.Continuing north, there were again only tracks until reaching the roadleading from the Bangkok-Chieng Mai railway, through Chieng Rai and thencevia Kentung to Taunggyi. On the Siamese side of the frontier this road was good;on our side it was fair-weather only for part of the way.There were only tracks leading from Burma into Northern Indo-China, andthese involved the crossing of the River Mekong. Into China itself there was afair track from Kentung to Puerhfu, and, secondly, the main road from Lashioto Kunming.  A road from Bhamo joined the latter near the frontier.Westwards, a start had been made on a road communication with India,but this was by no means complete wben war broke out.Landing grounds had been established in the Tenasserim Peninsula withthe object of facilitating the movement of aircraft between Burma and Malaya;the main ones were at Tavoy, Mergui and Victoria Point. The last was veryisolated, and it was realised that it probably could not be held for long if warwith Japan broke out.19. It was estimated that the total force which the Japanese could bringagainst Burma, using land communications only, would be about two divisions, ofwhich one division would be on the road running through Chieng Rai. TheChiefs of Staff considered in January 1941 that, although four enemy divisionscould be maintained at railhea,d on the Bangkok-Chieng Mai railway, it was unlikely that even one division could be maintained on the Burma side of thefrontier, owing to the limited road communications^5) The situation would,however, be completely altered should the Japanese get control of sea communi-cations in the Bay of Bengal. In that case, their capture of Mergui, andpossibly Tavoy, would only be a question of time. They would be able tooutflank our positions at Moulmein, and our line of communication thence withRangoon; and, should Singapore fall or be invested, would be able to bringby sea against Burma a force much greater than two divisions.20. Turning to the Chieng Rai line of advance, owing to the indifferentroad on our side of the frontier and the shortage of Mechanical Transport, itwas impracticable to maintain a big force east of the Salween. The policy,therefore, was to fight delaying actions as far forward as possible, and to makethe Salween the main line of defence.Owing to the heavy growth of trees along the Japanese lines of advance,conditions were not generally favourable for air reconnaissance. On the otherhand, there were certain open defiles against which air bombing would probably have been very effective, and it was hoped that sufficient air force would beavailable to deter the Japanese advance to a great extent. For this purposeaerodromes were constructed with the object of being able to concentrate either on Central or South Burma, and against either the Mesod road or the Chieng Rairoad.Demolitions were prepared along the enemy lines of advance, especially on the Chieng Rai road.Engineering Programme.21. There was a great shortage of engineers, both civil and military. in planning the engineering programme, priority was given first to aerodromeconstruction and accommodation for the Royal Air Force; secondly, to road construction for strategical and tactical purposes, including ferries; and thenaccommodation for troops and stores, including ammunition.In the time available there was no opportunity to complete elaborate concretedefence lines; all that could be done was to construct field defences on the probablelines of approach. There were limitations even to this : first, the difficulty ofworking and the prevalence of malaria in the rainy season; secondly, the numberof troops available; and thirdly, the lack of Mechanical Transport, until theAutumn of 1941, which severely limited the number of men that could bemaintained near, and east of, the Salween River.(0) CCS. 39 of January 10, 1941, paragraph 16. This telegram commented on the SingaporeConference of October 1940.
Strength of Forces.22. The composition of the military forces in Burma when war broke out isshown in Appendix J, and the situation regarding Anti-Aircraft guns inAppendix H.As will be seen, the organisation was somewhat complicated from the desireto make every possible use of local resources. Originally, the Burma frontier force had been independent of the General Officer Commanding in peace, and only came under him in time of war. His Excellency Sir Eeginald Dorman Smithdecided to put the Burma Frontier Force under the General Officer Commanding&apos;control in peace as well, thus simplifying the organisation. The change was effected on the 10th November, 1941.The Independent Company was abolished before war with Japan broke out,the British portion being used mainly for additional squads for Chineseguerillas, and the Burmese returning to their original units.23. In the Singapore Conference of October 1940 it was recommended that,as regards the Army, the force, immediately required for the defence of Burmawas as follows : 5 infantry brigades and two additional battalions;1 field regiment and 1 battery;2 mountain batteries;1 anti-tank battery;1 heavy A.A. regiment (24 guns);1 light A.A. battery, non-mobile (16 guns);1 light A.A. battery, mobile; and1 company light tanks.This was exclusive of the Burma Frontier Force and of the Territorial and auxiliary,forces allotted to internal security duties. It was also stated that anadditional requirement for the long-term problem was : one Division, less certainunits, which made the fighting portion of this Division as follows : 2 infantry brigades, each of 3 battalions;1 reconnaissance unit;1 field regiment (24 guns);1 medium regiment (16 guns);1 light AA. regiment (48 guns);1 anti-tank battery; and1 machine gun battalion.In their comments of January 1941, on the Conference, the Chiefs of staff stated that they considered both the threat of attack, and the demands for land forces, had been overstated. Comparing the Conference recommendations withthe total Army strength available in Burma in December 1941 (see Appendix J),and omitting the Burma Frontier Force and the Territorial and Auxiliary forces,the shortages were approximately 3 field batteries;1 anti-tank battery; and1 company light tanksout of the immediate requirements, and the whole of the additional requirement.Apart from this, up to the outbreak of the war with Japan, Burma remainedshort of : Rifles;Mechanical transport vehicles;Officers for the General Officer Commanding&apos;s staff and services; and medical personnel.24. A Burma Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve under the command of commander K. S. Lyle, R.N., had been raised in 1940. It had two or three patrolboats operating off the Tenasserim Peninsula, and was also responsible for mine-sweeping the Rangoon approaches and for examination services. There were several other craft building at Rangoon, but these had been held up mainly owingto the delay in obtaining engines and fittings from England. The force wasunder the Commander-in-Chief, China, for operations, and under the governor of Burma for administration. It was not under the General Officer Commanding,though co-operation was very satisfactory.
25. In November 1940, air strength in Burma was practically non-existent.The Singapore Conference had recommended the following: 1 general reconnaissance squadron;2 bomber squadrons; and1 fighter squadron.No. 60 Squadron, equipped with Blenheim bombers, arrived from India inFebruary 1941; in August 1941, one flight was reorganised as a fighter flightand equipped with Brewster Buffaloes. Later, a complete Buffalo squadron,No. 67, was sent from Malaya in November 1941, and the whole of No. 60 Squadronreverted to bombers. There was a Burma Volunteer Air Unit, but this had not got further than a small training organisation. This merely gave Burma two squadrons, which was admittedly very weak, and, actually, when war broke out,most of the Blenheim squadron, No. 60, was in Malaya for bombing practice.On the other hand, the American Volunteer Group of the International AirForce started to train in Burma in August 1941, and there was an understanding,amounting practically to an agreement, with General Chiang Kai-shek that, ifBurma was attacked, part, or the whole, of this American Volunteer group would be detailed for the defence of Burma. Actually, two of the AmericanVolunteer Group squadrons were sent to Kunming when war with Japan broke out, and one to Mingalodon, near Rangoon.It was my opinion that the defence of Burma depended largely upon holding-Malaya, and that the defence of the latter must have priority. I also considered it unlikely that the Japanese would attack Burma solely in order to cut the burma road to China. They knew that this must involve war with Great Britain, andin all probability with the Dutch and perhaps also the United States. If theywere going to face this, they would be much more likely to start attackingSingapore than Burma. Admittedly, we were working on probabilities and notcertainties, but, in view of the weakness of our air forces, it was essential to concentrate the maximum effort and not try to be equally strong in two places.The American Volunteer Group.26. The American Volunteer Group consisted of three single-seater fighter squadrons, which were equipped with Tomahawks up to the time I handed overcommand.Doubtless the United States will not forget the help that was freely givento the American Volunteer Group by the Burma Government and by the RoyalAir Force. They were given the sole use of the Royal Air Force aerodrome atToungoo, allowed to use Mingalodon aerodrome, near Rangoon, for testingTomahawks after erection, and were offered the use of further aerodromes if required. Permission from London was given on the 22nd August, 1941, for theAmerican Volunteer Group to carry out operational training in Burma, and theywere given assistance in many other directions.On the 31st October, 1941, the British Ambassador, Chungking, represented to the Foreign Office that the situation in China was very serious. We were asked what we could do to help, and suggested that we might form a British fighter squadron with volunteers from the Royal Air Force to form part of the Inter-national Air Force, and possibly a bomber squadron as well. It was pointed outthat this proposal would mean a reduction in our own effective fighting and bombing strength. The suggestion was approved by the Chiefs of Staff, providedI was satisfied they would be able to operate effectively as part of the international air Force and that I could accept the detachment from the Malaya defences.(6)These squadrons would have been largely dependent on the American VolunteerGroup organisation for their maintenance. Pending a detailed examination of themaintenance arrangements in China, volunteers for these squadrons were notcalled for and actually they were never formed, but many preliminary steps were taken, including the movement of vehicles, spares and bombs.(7) I despatchedofficers to make a thorough investigation of the American Volunteer Groupmaintenance organisation. They found that in many respects it was quite inadequate; in particular, there were no aeroplane spares whatever though the engine spares were fairly good.  Steps were at once taken by my headquarters to(&quot;) CCS. F.E. 38 of November 5, 1941.   CCS. F.E.40 of November 7, 1941.(7) G.H.Q., F.E., No. 155/6 of November 15, 1941. ...
rectify this. No Tomahawk spares could be obtained from the Middle East, as any that could be spared had been sent to Russia. However, a telegram to theBritish liaison mission in Washington, and a personal telegram from me toGeneral MacArthur in Manila, resulted in a very fair stock of spares being received by the American Volunteer Group before war broke out. But for this,it is very doubtful if they could have gone on working for more than two or threeweeks.I found that the pilots of the American Volunteer Group were not satisfied with their Tomahawks when I visited them in September 1941. This was largelycorrected before war broke out, partly by giving details of the successes of theTomahawks in the Middle East, and partly by a test carried out between aBuffalo and a Tomahawk, which showed the latter to be considerably superiorin speed, climb and in manoeuvrability over some 10,000 feet.Aircraft Warning System.27. There was an air observation corps under General Officer Commanding,organised in five groups, each under an ex-inspector, of police, the observers beinglocal Burmans and Anglo-Burmans. This Observer Corps did good work, and,according to later reports, warnings of the attacks on Rangoon were received intime for the fighters to take off and get up. An R.D.F. set at Moulmein was juststarting to operate in December 1941.With regard to A.R.P., the original policy in Rangoon had been evacuation.Sir Reginald Dorman Smith decided to change this, and to construct air raidshelters.  There had been no time to complete these shelters before war broke out.Political Factors.28. The internal situation in Burma gave rise to much anxiety, and it was realised that in time of war it might become necessary to reinforce the police with military units. There were doubtless many reasons for this potential unrest, buttwo were particularly evident. The first was the influence of the Buddhist priest-hood, especially from Mandalay. In Burma itself, the priesthood was numerousand powerful; it had been brought largely under the influence of the anti-british political party, and consequently preached the doctrine of Burma for the burmese and complete independence. Many efforts were being made to counteractthis, and were partially successful. Apparently, in the Shan States, the nativerulers had kept a tighter control over the Buddhist priests than we did in Burmaproper, and had limited their numbers.The second reason was the anti-Indian feeling. The Indians in Burma were much more clever than the Burmese in business transactions, and, amongst other things, lent money out on mortgage, with the result that they owned a large pro-portion about one-half of the best agricultural land in Burma. We werelooked upon to some extent as protectors of. the Indians, and consequentlyattracted to ourselves part of the hatred that was felt by the Burmese for the indians over this land problem.-&apos;   Transfer of Command to Commander-in-Chief, India.29. On the 12th December a telegram was received from the Chiefs of Staffstating that the defence of Burma was to be transferred from Commander-in-Chief, Ear East, to Commander-in-Chief, India, including all relations with china. The transfer was effected as from 0630 hours on the 15th December, 1941.IV. FACTORS AFFECTING THE DEFENCE OF HONG KONG.Authorities.30. In November 1940 General Norton was Acting Governor of Hong-Kong. Sir  reoffrey Northcote resumed his post as Governor on the 13th March,1941, and handed over to his successor, Sir Mark Young, on the 10th September,1941. Major General Maltby took over the duties of General Officer Commandingfrom Major-General Grasett on the 19th July, 1941.
General Policy.31. Hong Kong was regarded officially as an undesirable military commitment, or else as an outpost to be held as long as possible!e(8). It must,however, be considered in relation to the whole defence of the Far East,especially China and the Philippines. The withdrawal of our troops fromPeking, Tientsin and Shanghai in the summer of 1941 after the collapse ofFrance was recognised by General Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese as being an inevitable and wise move, but the Chinese interest in the defence of HongKong grew as their war developed and their difficulties increased. Hong Kongwas very valuable to China as a port of access and had they not been convinced of our determination to stand and fight for its defence, and been taken into our confidence and given opportunities to inspect the defences and discuss plans for defence, the effect on their war effort would in all probability have been serious. A withdrawal of the troops in Hong Kong coinciding with the closing of the Burma Road might have had a marked effect on Chinese determination to fight on. Our policy for the defence of Hong Kong, therefore, in all probabilityplayed an important part at a critical period in China&apos;s war effort.As regards the Philippines, according to information available in Singapore,it was doubtful, at any rate up to the middle of 1941, whether the Americansintended to defend the islands, or whether they did not. It is therefore possible,that had we demilitarised Hong Kong, or announced our intention of notdefending it, the Americans might have adopted a similar policy with regardto the Philippines. In this case, they might have ceased to take direct interestin the Far East, and confined themselves to the Eastern half of the Pacific.Should this supposition be correct, then the attempted defence of Hong Kongwas justified for this reason alone, even though it did- ultimately lead to theloss of six battalions and other troops.Strength of Defences.32. The strength of the Hong Kong garrison is given in Appendix K.The official period for which Hong Kong was to be provisioned, both in military stores and food reserves, was 130 days.The main defence of Hong Kong was on the Island. Whilst the enemy were to be delayed as long as possible in any advance over the leased territoryon the mainland, the troops had orders to retire if attacked in force, as theywere required for the defence of the Island itself. The Gin Drinkers line was naturally a strong one, and much work had been done on it, but it would have,required two divisions or more to hold properly.Two Canadian battalions arrived in Hong Kong on the 16th November,1941. This extra force was of greater value than the figures would indicate.Whilst there were only four battalions in Hong Kong, only one could be sparedfor the Gin Drinkers line, which practically meant merely a thin outpost line.As this battalion was also essential for the defence of Hong Kong Island, itwould not have been able to put up any resistance, but would have had to retirebefore the advance of even a weak force, since heavy casualties would prejudice the defence of the Island, and could not be faced. With the arrival of thesetwo Canadian battalions, three could be put into the Gin Drinkers line, anda far stronger resistance could be put up, not merely because of the increasedstrength, but because casualties would not cripple the subsequent defence of hong Kong Island. Even a few days delay in the occupation of the mainlandby the enemy was of great value, enabling steps to be completed which it was impracticable to take before the outbreak of war, for instance, the movementof the fishing fleet and waterborne population out of Hong Kong waters.33. A great deal of work had been done in preparing the island for defence, and the construction and concealment of pill-boxes and obstacles showedmuch originality and initiative. Preparations were also made for offensive operations against islands near Hong Kong, should the Japanese seize them,and for &quot; left-behind &quot; parties on the mainland. Every advantage was taken of any local resources available for defence.34. There were two Walrus amphibians and four Vildebeeste aeroplanesat Hong Kong, located at Kai Tak aerodrome on the mainland.   The former(8) C.O.S. (40) 592 (Revise), Annex 1, paragraph 37.
might have been of some value for reconnaissance; in war it had been intendedto operate them from Aberdeen Harbour, on the South side of Hong Kong-Island, but this was apparently found impracticable. The latter would havehad to remain at Kai Tak since no possible site for an aerodrome could be found on the Island itself. It was realised that these aeroplanes could not last forlong in time of war, and that the Kai Tak aerodrome would, in fact, be quiteunusuable unless the Gin Drinkers line could be held.Civil Population Factors.35. - One of the main problems in the defence of Hong Kong was the largeChinese population.   This had nearly doubled during the three years previousto December.1941, owing to the influx from China.  The population in April 1941was Hong Kong...............      709,000Kowloon      ...............      581,000Water population ...      ...      ......      154,000Total    ...............    1,444,000This is exclusive of the population of what is known as the New Territories onthe mainland.The great increase above the normal population led to many problems, e.g.,civil hospital accommodation and medical staff, police control, supply of water,food and firewood. In addition, this increase, combined with the constant move-ment taking place between the Island and the mainland, rendered it very difficultto keep complete control of the Chinese, and made it easy for the Japanese toacquire information.36. The reservoirs on Hong Kong Island were partly filled by rain water and partly by a supply from the mainland. It was, of course, realised that this latter supply might be cut, but calculations showed that the rain, added to the capacity of the reservoirs, was normally sufficient to meet the essential require-ments of Hong Kong Island, so long as the whole Island remained in our hands.If there was a dry spell during the winter, the supply might have been short inFebruary and March, and there might hot have been sufficient to supply waterto deal with outbreaks of fire. Although fire engines could draw on sea water,the higher levels of the town of Victoria could not be reached in one lift. this difficulty was largely overcome, however, by the installation of service tanks atmedium levels, which it was intended to keep filled with sea water by separatepumps.37. As regards food, rice was a constant anxiety, since most of it had tobe imported from Siam or Burma. In addition, what was known as the ricesupplement was a problem, since fish would not be available in case of war, and storage of alternatives over a period of&apos;months was difficult. In December 1941the stocks of food were not much short of that required for the period laid down,i.e., 130 days. The local supply of firewood was insufficient, and some was beingimported from North Borneo.38. The A.P.P. organisation in Hong Kong was good, and some 12,000A.R.P. workers of one sort or another had been enrolled before war broke out.In addition, tunnels were made into the granite hills behind the town of Victoria;these provided admirable shelters which should have been proof against any typeof bomb. The limitation here was the number of pneumatic drills that could beobtained to enable the necessary blasting to be carried out. It was a slow process,but by the time war broke out there was shelter accommodation in the tunnels,concrete splinter-proof shelters and strengthened houses for about 300,000.Provision was made for the movement of the balance to hutments outside the town.39. Most of the European women and children had been moved away from hong Kong by July 1941, the total leaving being approximately 1,680 women and children belonging to the Navy, Army or Air Force, and 1,824 civilian. Thisleft about 918 European women and girls in Hong Kong. Of these 595 werenurses and medical staff, 60 held key duties in A.R.P. and the majority of theremaining 263 were employed in clerical and other duties. The Governors order for the movement of women and children away from Hong Kong had beendisputed, but was upheld in a test case in the courts.
V.-PROBLEMS AND WORK OF GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,FAR EAST.Site of General Headquarters.40. General Headquarters started to function at 0800 hours on Monday, the18th November. The order issued to the three General Officers Commanding andthe Air Officer Commanding outlining their relations to General Headquarters isgiven in Appendix C.One of the first problems I had to decide was the site of my Headquarters.The Army Headquarters was at Fort Canning and the Air Force Headquarterswas in newly-built hutments about five miles away. The Governor and other civil authorities were in Singapore town. The Naval Commander-in-Chief had his headquarters at the Naval Base, which was some 35 minutes by road from singapore. It was important for my Headquarters to keep in touch with alltnese, I hoped at one time that the Commander-in-Chief, China, would move to singapore, but he felt very strongly that he had to remain in the Naval Base,where the F.E.C.B. was also located. A compromise might have beenpossible but would have entailed dividing F.E.C.B. After much consideration,I decided that the dominant factors were to ensure close touch with theCommander-in-Chief, China, and to keep the F.E.C.B. intact. Accordingly, myheadquarters moved to the Naval Base in January 1941, but I continued to reside in Singapore, which enabled me to have interviews with the General OfficerCommanding, Air Officer Commanding and the Governor, either before I went tothe office or on my return. This was not a perfect solution, but it was the bestone in all the circumstances.Another factor which influenced me in coming to this decision was the dangerof my Headquarters becoming intimately involved in the defence of Malaya ifI remained at Singapore, to the neglect of the wider problems of the defence ofthe Far East. ;Relations with Commander-in-Chief, China Station.41. From about June 1941 onwards an intelligence conference was held atten o&apos;clock every morning, and was attended by the Commander-in-Chief, China,and myself, and our senior staff officers. Generally speaking, the division of responsibilities was clear, and in other cases they were divided up without any difficulty. The Commander-in-Chief, China, had been dealing with Free Frenchproblems, and continued to do so after my Headquarters was formed. As ourrelations with French Indo-China were largely concerned with economics and shipping, he dealt with most of the problems of that country, whilst myHeadquarters dealt mainly with Siam. He also agreed to take over responsibilityfor control of the Press and continued to do so up to the beginning of December,when Sir Tom Phillips arrived and I took over this responsibility.Other questions, such as food supplies, we dealt with together. In this casealso shipping was largely involved, and as the Commander-in-Chief, China, hada representative on the Food Committee, he generally represented our combinedviews at meetings of the War Committee.The Commander-in-Chief. China, took over from me the control of the Mirioil denial scheme. This was found more convenient since the problems of oilsupply were more closely connected with the Navy than with the Army or AirForce, and the evacuation of both material and personnel from Miri was essentially Naval matter. - *Agreement was reached in regard to surface sea patrols near the coast, and itwas decided that the Naval authorities would be responsible for patrolling in the open sea and the Army would be responsible for similar work on the rivers.One or two estuaries were dealt with as special cases, but generally came underthe Naval authorities.Conferences at Singapore.42. Many conferences were held in Singapore both before and after theformation of General Headquarters, Far East.  These were as follows :-(a) The Franco-British Conference held in June 1939. The report of this conference contained some useful observations on the general problems, but the basic assumption of active French collaborationfrom Indo-China vanished with the collapse of France.
(b) The Singapore Conference of October 1940, with which should be included the Tactical Appreciation dated the 16th October, 1940, prepared bythe Commander-in-Chief, China Station, the General OfficerCommanding, Malaya, and the Air Officer Commanding, Far East.(See paras. 81 and 92 below.)(c) The conversations with the Dutch in December 1940, the principal object being to obtain information and agreement on certain matters raised in Appendix A of the Report of the Singapore Conference.(d) The Conference between British, Dutch and Australian representatives,with United States observers in attendance, held in Singapore inFebruary 1941, resulting in what is known as the A.D.A. agreement.This agreement included plans for mutual reinforcements, principallyof air forces and submarines.   (See para. 44 below.)(e) The Conference between the Americans, Dutch and British, includingAustralia and New Zealand, together with representatives of Indiaand the East Indies Station. This was held at Singapore in April1941, and resulted in what is known as the A.D.B. agreement. (see para. 45 below.) It was followed by a shorter agreement between theBritish and the Dutch, which dealt almost entirely with Naval matters,and was really a modification of the agreement reached in A.D.A.,bringing the latter into line with A.D.B. It was known as B.D.(/) Arising out of A.D.B., a detailed plan for naval and air operations, knownas Plenaps was drawn up.No political commitment was involved by these agreements, and A.D.A. andA.D.B. remained subject to ratification by the respective Governments.43. In the case of the conference leading to the A.D.A. and A.D.B.agreements, I felt that the representation was somewhat unbalanced. In theformer, the Naval representation of the Dominions was weak since the Chief ofthe Naval Staff in Australia, Admiral Colvin, was unable to come, and NewZealand was represented by Australia. In the A.D.B. Conference, the Navalrepresentation was strong but that of the Dominion Army and Air Force wascomparatively weak. Further, in A.D.B. the United States representatives were somewhat junior, and there was no representative of the Pacific Fleet, but only of the Asiatic.44. In A.D.A. the necessity for collective action was emphasised, it beingpointed out that Japanese aggression against any one country would be of vitalimportance to the others. Agreement was reached on the particular actions by japan which would necessitate the Naval and Military authorities concernedadvising their respective Governments to take active military counter-action. Asuggestion was made that Commanders-in-Chief on the spot might be allowed totake measures in such circumstances without prior reference to London.The principle of mutual reinforcement was agreed, the Dutch undertaking to provide submarines for operation in the South China Sea, as well as one fighter and three bomber squadrons to reinforce Malaya; whilst it was estimated that four Bomber squadrons would be available from Malaya to reinforce theNetherlands East Indies. Australia was prepared to assist by the provision of army units, and of an air striking force at Darwin to reinforce Ambon andKoepang. The necessary administrative arrangements to prepare for these land and air reinforcements were to be undertaken at once, and progress reports wereto be rendered monthly to G.H.Q., Far East. The principles on which sea communications would be defended were outlined, and emphasis was laid onthe importance of making the passage of the Northern line of the Dutchpossessions as difficult as possible for the Japanese.The A.D.A. report was approved generally by the Chiefs of Staff, the mainexception being that there could be iio prior definition of an act of war andautomatic reaction without reference to London.45. In the A.D.B. report it was stressed that the Atlantic and Europewere the decisive theatres of war, so that the forces employed in other theatresmust be reduced to a minimum. Our main strategy in the Far East for the time must, therefore, be defensive, but it was recommended that preparations shouldbe made for air operations against Japanese-occupied territory and against japan herself, both from China and from Luzon. &quot;.
The necessity for collective action was reaffirmed as well as the particularactions by Japan which would necessitate the Commanders concerned advisingtheir respective Governments to take active military counter-action. Theimportance of Luzon, especially from the offensive point of view, was emphasised,and a recommendation made that its defence should be strengthened. It wassuggested in this connection that Hong Kong might be of value as a subsidiarybase. It was also recommended that the British and U.S.A. should support theChinese Army, especially with finance and equipment, should assist the guerillaoperations in China, and organise subversive activity in Japan and Japanese-occupied territories.It was recommended that the Commander-in-Chief, China Station, should exercise strategical direction over all Naval forces, excluding those employedsolely on local defence or operating under Commander-in-Chief, United States. Asiatic Fleet. Similarly, it was recommended that the Commander-in-Chief,Far East, should exercise strategical direction of the air forces in the Far East.The areas of responsibility were defined. The basis of a plan for Naval and air co-operation -operation, both as regards reinforcements and reconnaissance, was laid down.This included the movement of surface vessels of the United States Asiatic Fleetfrom Manila to Singapore if the former were attacked, and the despatch of twoor more Dutch submarines to the South China Sea, all operating under theOommander-in-Chief, China.- * For purposes of planning, the air forces available for mutual reinforcementwere assumed to be : From Malaya : 4 bomber squadrons;From Netherlands East Indies : 3 bomber and 1 fighter squadrons;From Philippines : all available, but in case of evacuation only; andFrom Australia : 2 bomber squadrons for the Ambon-Timor Area.In telegraphic comments by the Commanders-in-Chief, Far East and China,two points were specially stressed : first, the great importance to the defence ofthe Far East of offensive operations by the United States Pacific Fleet, a point that was deliberately omitted from the report; and, secondly, the importance of strengthening the defences of Luzon.The A.D.B. report was, with one or two exceptions, approved by the Chiefsof Staff in London.(9) The exceptions were that, whilst they would welcome anystrengthening of the Philippines which could be effected otherwise than at theexpense of the United States effort in the Atlantic, they were not prepared to press the point in the United States: and that Hong Kong was unlikely to be of muchvalue as an advanced base for operations by United States submarines and naval aircraft against the Japanese sea communications.But, although signed by the representatives of the United States, the report was objected to in Washington, mainly on the ground that certain political matters had been introduced. An amended A.D.B. agreement, known as A.D.B. 2, wastherefore drawn up in London in August 1941, leaving all the main features ofA.D.B. practically unchanged, but putting the political matters into an appendix. (10) This, however, did not entirely satisfy the United States autho-rities in Washington, and eventually it was decided that a further conference should be held in the Far East to draw up a modified A.D.B. This information was conveyed to me on the 25th November, 1941,(&quot;) but was received too late forany action to be taken before war started.In spite of this, A.D.B. and Plenaps remained the basis on which we were able to work before, and immediately after, the outbreak of war with Japan, both with the Netherlands East Indies and, to a lesser degree, with the Philippines.(But see para. 113 below.)Information from London.46. I found on arrival in the Far East that there was considerable ignorance of modern war conditions, both in the Army and the Air Force. This could not,of course, be made good entirely by documents; personal experience was essential.(12)(9) 0.0.S. F.E.8 of May 17, 1941.(IU) Chiefs of Staff C.O.S.

For some months after the formation of my General Headquarters there seemed to be considerable delay in getting- information from England with regardto the lessons of recent operations and developments in tactical ideas, both asregards the Army and the Air Force, though A.R.P. pamphlets seemed to arriveregularly soon after issue. The situation improved about July 1941, but we were always uncertain whether we were being kept up to date. This feeling of beingneglected was naturally intensified by the distance of London from Singapore,and the whole position in this respect would have been greatly improved if visits by liaison officers from the War Office and Air Ministry had been made from timeto time. This was actually started in the case of the War Office, and the firstliaison officer arrived in Singapore in November 1941. I believe it was intendedto do the same in the case of the Air Ministry. It would have been a great helphad this been done twelve months earlier.Training.47. As regards training, steps were taken to ensure that troops werethoroughly acquainted with the nature of the country in which they would haveto operate. This was simple in the case of Hong Kong, where units knew exactly the ground over which they were going to fight. It was more difficult in the caseof Malaya, as the nature of the country varied considerably, but here special attention was paid to movements through jungle and the acquisition of junglelore, and many units reached a high stage of proficiency in this. The Volunteersin Malaya were called up for training during February and March 1941.Apart from minor Staff Exercises, two were carried out under general headquarters: the first in December 1940, to test out communications andco-operation between the Army and the Royal Air Force; and the second, a moreambitious one, in March 1941, to test out all the stages of a change-over frompeace to war for the civil authorities as well as for the three Services. Thisbrought but many useful lessons. A very successful exercise based on this secondone was held in Burma in July 1941, and Hong Kong carried out two or threeon similar lines.Defensive Preparations.48. The question of the best method of defending the important sectors ofthe East Coast of Malaya gave rise to much discussion. One school of thoughtargued that, as there were insufficient numbers to defend any great length ofbeach, the enemy would be able to land outside the defended portion, thus out-flanking the defenders and possibly cutting them off. The best course of action was, therefore, to fight on a prepared position in rear where the road leadinginto the interior could be defended. This school also argued that attempts tohold the beaches would result in a purely linear defence with insufficient troopsin hand for counter-attack.The view of General Headquarters, Far East, was that it was essential tohold the beaches, because it was during the period of landing that the enemy would be most vulnerable, and if the beaches were given up he would be fighting on equality with us. Again, it was during this process of landing that our most effective co-operation between the Army and Air, and possibly the Navy as well,could be effected. Admittedly there was a danger of having a purely lineardefence, but this was primarily a question of adjustment between the forcesretained in reserve and those detailed for holding the beaches themselves.Another point was that of all-round defence. It was difficult with the forces available to have units in a group of perimeter posts and at the same time toprotect an adequate length of beach. Further, the defenders must be preparedto hold on for a period to be reckoned by weeks rather than by days, even ifsurrounded by the enemy and cut off. There was but little object in this unlessadequate reserves were available in rear to attack the enemy and restore thesituation. The 22nd Australian Brigade at Mersing found a satisfactory solution to the problem in that they had perimeter defences for units, mutually supportingeach other and primarily defending the beaches. But in their case the27th Australian Brigade was available in Johore for counter-attack on a large scale. The problem was more difficult at Kuantan and Kota Bharu for thereasons indicated above.   (See para. 12.)Although it was my policy to allow the General Officers-in-Command as muchfreedom as possible, I found it necessary in the case of Malaya to issue orders
that the first line of our defence was to be the beaches. Previously, except onSingapore Island and Penang, beaches were going to be occupied only bywatching posts, and the first lines of defence were sited inland. This changeinvolved a considerable amount of work and preparation of obstacles and defenceposts at Mersing, Kuantan and Kota Bharu.It was found at one period that the work of preparing positions and putting up obstacles was taking up so much time that the training of the troops wasbeing hampered; and, in addition, the wire generally required renewing after about six months. Also, I was always on guard against too much reliance uponwater obstacles, barbed wire and pill-boxes, in case this should lead to a maginot line complex to the detriment of the offensive spirit. Consequently, a divisionof available hours was drawn up, allowing a proportion for training, a proportionfor renewals, and the balance for new work. As far as practicable, troopsconstructed the actual defences in which they would normally fight. New workscarried out included not only defensive preparations, but facilities for makingcounter-attacks, e.g., preparation of hidden paths fit for Bren Carriers.Looking back in the light of what actually happened, it is easy to pointout that a lot of the preparation was wasted, and that the energy so taken up should have been expended elsewhere; for instance, a great deal of time was spent on the Mersing area, which was never heavily attacked. Mersing, however,was a very important place, and, had the Japanese established themselves hereinstead of at Kota Bharu, they would have been at once within a short distance of Singapore; and it is possible that, had these defences been less strong, theymight have attacked the Mersing area at an early stage in the operations. I feel,however, that steps should have been taken before war broke out to strengthen the defences on the Northern and North-Western sides of Singapore Island.49. We also had to be prepared for the possibility of a break-through in theMersing area, which would have isolated Southern and Northern Malaya from singapore, and this consideration affected the siting of depots for stores andammunition. Therefore, preparations were made to enable a force to be supplied,if necessary, by a line of communication running through Kuala Lumpur toPenang, so that they would be able to operate quite independently of Singapore.Another possibility that had to be considered was that of a sudden descentwithout warning on a part of Singapore Island with the object either of destroying some important place, such as the main wireless station, or to establish a footing, awaiting subsequent reinforcements. This possibility was met by having a portion of the Singapore garrison ready to come into action and moveat very short notice.Operation &quot; Matador.&quot;50. The importance of the Southern end of the Kra Isthmus, especially theneighbourhood of Singora, has already been referred to (see paragraph 12 above).The possibility of an advance into this Isthmus, in order to hold a positionNorth of Haad Yai Junction, was considered soon after the formation of general headquarters, Far East.(13) Detailed plans for carrying out this operation wereprepared, and the code word &apos;&apos; Matador &quot; was eventually given to it. It was from the start realised that the essential feature of this operation was fore-stalling the Japanese on a position near Singora; see, for instance, my telegramof the 22nd March, 1941, to the Chiefs of Staff through the War Office,j&quot;) inwhich it is stated : &quot; The success of this plan would depend on rapidity of execution in order to forestall the Japanese on the Songhla line&apos;&apos;; also my telegram of the 21st November, 1941,(15) from which the following is an extract:&quot; I wish to emphasise the fact that the forestalling of the Japanese in Singoraarea is essential to the success of &apos; Matador.&apos; &apos;&apos;This necessitated at least twenty-four hours&apos; start before the Japaneselanded, and rapid movement of our force once the order was given. It was realised all along that, if these conditions could not be fulfillled, then theMatador operation would be impracticable. The psychological value of offensive movement at the start of the war and the possibility of thereby upsettingthe Japanese plans were fully realised, but had to be weighed against the fact(13) G.H.Q. P.E. 40 of December 7, 1940, paragraph 11.G-.H.Q. F.E. 125/2.(&quot;) G.H.Q. F.E. 218/6, paragraph 1.
that we should be leaving prepared ground with which the troops were familiar,and that, unless we forestalled the enemy, the fighting would be in the natureof an encounter battle, quite possibly against superior numbers. Further, theattitude of the Siamese was uncertain, and questions of secrecy precluded anyattempt to get prior agreement from Bangkok. Orders were issued that, shouldMatador be ordered, any opposition from the Siamese was to be overcome atonce, but we could never be certain in advance how much delay might be caused toour movements by obstacles, destruction of bridges or active resistance. A margin of time was necessary.A total of thirty officers, two or three at a time, were sent over as visitors tothe area in plain clothes in order to collect information, especially on the topo-graphy of the country, and to have some individuals familiar with it.The preparations were completed before the Autumn of 1941 as far as couldbe foreseen, including maps, arrangements for the distribution of rice to thepopulation, the collection of a quantity of Siamese money, and writing, ready for translation and printing, pamphlets of three varieties to suit the differentattitudes which might be adopted by the Siamese Government. For reasons of secrecy, knowledge of the plans was confined to a minimum number of individuals, and for the same reason certain steps could not be taken in advance.For instance, it was considered dangerous to translate or print the pamphletsbefore the operation was ordered.51. Up to the 5th December, Matador was not to be carried out without reference to the War Cabinet, but on that date a telegram(16) was sent to the effectthat I could order it without reference to London in either of the following-contingencies : (a) If I had information that the Japanese expedition was advancing withthe apparent intention of landing on the Kra Isthmus; or(&amp;).&apos;If the Japanese violated any other part of Thailand (Siam).A few days earlier it had been impressed on me that carrying out Matadorif the Japanese intended to make a landing in Southern Siam would almost certainly mean war with Japan,(17) and in view of this I considered it my duty to be scrupulously careful in acting on the telegram of the 5th December.Aerodrome Policy.52. The number and location of aerodromes in Malaya was based on theprinciple of relying mainly on air power for defence. This also applied, though in a somewhat smaller degree to Burma.It meant, first, having a sufficient number of aerodromes to make use ofthe mobility of aircraft for concentrating a large proportion of our squadrons in any given area; and, secondly, choosing sites as far forward as practicableso as to enable us to reach out the maximum distance both for reconnaissance and for offensive operations. This was particularly important in the case of attacks on Japanese convoys in order to ensure having sufficient time to carryout more than one attack before they reached our coast.The total number of aerodromes prepared was based on the figure of 336Initial Equipment aircraft, and since this figure was never reached we had insome areas more aerodromes than we were able to use, the surplus being a liabilityrather than an asset. . The forecasts of development of our air strength wereadmittedly uncertain, but in view of the long time taken to construct an aerodromein Malaya we could not afford to wait until we knew definitely that more aircraft were coming. The Army dispositions were largely influenced by the necessityfor protecting Royal Air Force aerodromes. As events turned out, owing to the weakness of the Royal Air Force at the time war started, the defence of Malayadevolved largely upon the Army, which meant that sites for aerodromes werenot always the most suitable for operations as they were actually carried out.But it was impossible to have foreseen this, since no one could have known inadvance when the Japanese would start the war.In the autumn of 1941, orders were issued that four of the aerodromes in malaya and two in Burma were to be extended so as to be suitable for the(10) CCS. F.E. No. 50 of December 5, 1941.(17) C.O.S. F.E. No. 48 of November 29, 1941.
operation of heavy bombers up to the Boeing Fortress type. This meant runwaysof 2,000 yards with a surface sufficiently strong to bear the weight of these aircraft fully loaded.Sufficient attention was not always given to the tactical siting of aerodromesfrom the point of view of their defence. There was rather a tendency at onetime to site them solely with reference to their suitability for flying operations;and in one or two cases they were located too near the coast where they were a definite danger so long as the Japanese had command of the sea. This, however,was corrected, and it was laid down that no aerodrome was to be selected orplanned except in conjunction with the staff officer of the Army organisationconcerned, a principle also applied to the siting of buildings and&apos; aircraft pens.The buildings on some of the original aerodromes in Malaya had been laid outentirely on a peace basis, for they were hot dispersed and were in straight lines;this was noticeably the case at Alor Star.53. We learned a lesson from the Dutch as regards the siting of aerodromes.In Borneo, the communications of which were undeveloped, they worked on theprinciple of locating aerodromes 25 to 50 miles from the coast in jungle country with only one line of access, generally, a road, but sometimes a river. This, ofcourse, considerably simplified the problem of defence against overland attacks.It was practicable only to a limited extent in Malaya, but it was laid down thatany future aerodromes required in Sarawak and other parts of British Borneowould be sited on this principle.Aircraft Warning System.54. There was no air observation system in Malaya when I arrived, andits organisation entailed a large amount of work. The responsibility was atfirst placed upon the G.O.C. and was later transferred to the A.O.C. SomeR.D.F. sets were received during 1941, and before war broke out an airobservation system was working well as regards Southern Malaya and Singapore;it was not good up North, partly owing to the lack of depth from the frontier and partly because we had not sufficient R.D.F. sets to install any in the North.Communications were difficult the whole time, as we were short generally ofsignalling equipment, especially material for the construction of land lines:tut the Government Post and Telegraph Service was most helpful, and war experience proved that so long as the Japanese were kept out of SouthernMalaya, Singapore could always rely on half an hour&apos;s warning of hostileaircraft. This was, of course, reduced after the Japanese advance had forcedus to leave certain P.D.F. stations.Other Matters that Required Action.55. Some special camouflage officers having been sent out from England inthe late summer of 1941, a Camouflage Committee was set up in Malaya andcamouflage classes formed in Malaya for the Far East. Priority in camouflagework was given to the Naval Base and aerodromes, but work was also being done for civilian establishments which were important to the war effort. All this involved a period of years rather than months and was by no means complete whenwar broke out.The formation of Labour Units in Malaya was a matter that was delayed for various reasons. Finally, however, it was decided to recruit Chinesein Hong Kong, which had the advantage not only of getting labour, but also of reducing the Chinese population of Hong Kong, but, unfortunately, the project was not executed before war broke out.Arrangements were made for successive variations in the route to befollowed by civil aircraft between Australia and India in the event of war with japan.56. In December 1940 there was a serious deficiency in ammunition,especially for the 4-5 and 3-7 A.A. guns, and in reserves for ordnance storeswhich were only sufficient for 90 days instead of 180. Anti-tank weapons and mines, 3-inch mortars and ammunition were also short.(&quot;&quot;)(17a) .G.H.Q., F.E. No. 72 of December 16, 1940, to Chiefs of Staff.
Aircraft bombs at this time, were also quite insufficient to allow for the expected expansion, and up to the autumn of 1941, -5 ammunition for theBuffaloes was difficult to obtain in adequate quantity.By December 1941, some- of these deficiencies had been made good. (Seeparagraph 94 below.)57. Although the Government Post and Telegraph Service was responsiblefor the communications on the mainland from Malaya, the lines on SingaporeIsland were mainly in the hands of a private company known as O.T.E.C.This caused some difficulties, e.g., as regards maintenance of stocks of spares.But it was decided that the situation in 1941 was not suitable for making the big changes that would have been involved had the Government taken over this company.58. I found the Malayan War Committee was not on a satisfactory basis;there were no agenda and no minutes, so that there was always uncertainty as towhat had been decided and who was responsible for taking action. This wascorrected, a new Secretary for Defence was appointed, and three civilians were brought into the War Committee with good results. The Commander-in-Chief,China, and I were not members of this War Committee, but had a permanentinvitation from the Governor to attend meetings.Press Relations.59. It was realised in the Spring of 1941 that some organisation to dealwith the. Press would be necessary when war broke out, and, further, that it wouldbe important before war during periods of strained relations with Japan. As aresult of a conference attended by all concerned, an organisation was worked out and brought into operation in the middle of May 1941. The essential feature ofit was that the Press relations of all three services were grouped under one head.As has-been stated above (in paragraph 41), Commander-in-Chief, China, agreedto be responsible for Press relations, and a Commander, R.N., who was called up from the Reserve, was put at the head of the Services Press Bureau. I was, and still am, of the opinion that this organisation was workable. Unfortunately,there were some discordant personalities, and, finally, after war broke out, a some-what different organisation was adopted, with Sir George Sansom at the head.I always found the Press ready to help when they were asked (see, forinstance, paragraph 112 below) and on many occasions we got good value from them. On the other hand, some representatives of the Press of other countries,e.g., the United States, were difficult and required very tactful handling; and wewere undoubtedly hampered in the Far East through lack of officers experiencedm dealing with the Press.Complaints reached the Ministry of Information in London that press correspondents were not being properly treated; in my reply to one that was passed on to Singapore (1S) I stated (10) : &apos;&apos; Should be most grateful for any assistanceyou can give to assure that we get out here officers who have knowledge ofthe work and can be trusted to work loyally as a team and not for their ownindividual benefit.&quot; I feel that in this matter we should have had more help from England, principally in the way of suitable and experienced personnel from the beginning.I was reluctant to give Press interviews, but the importance of doing sofrom time to time was frequently intimated to me. There was one stockquestion I was frequently asked : &quot; Was I satisfied with the strength of the defences of Malaya or the Far East generally? &quot; I always gave the samereply, that I was never going to be satisfied because defensive preparationscould always be improved, and, so far as I could, I was not going to allow any of my subordinates to be satisfied either.60. One of the steps taken to discourage the Japanese from starting war was to emphasise the growing strength of our defences in Malaya. (Seeparagraph 5(a) above). The Chiefs of Staff stated in May 1941 that they saw no objection to this policy(20) and we were aided by directions from the Ministry(18) No. 55993 of December 5, 1941, from War Office.(10) No. 407/6 of December 7, 1941, from G.H.Q., F.E.(-&quot;) 66267 of May 12, 1941, from Chiefs of Staff through War Office.
of Information in London to their representative in Singapore. The methodadopted did not consist merely in extensive advertising of any reinforcements;sometimes when these were obvious they were given only a small notice in the papers or broadcast. On the other hand, when reinforcements of Royal AirForce personnel arrived they were merely referred to as Royal Air Force andno mention was made of the fact that no aeroplanes were with them. It isdoubtful if the effect was great, but it was probably not negligible.In interviews with Press correspondents whom I could trust, I made nosecret of the fact that the shortage of aeroplanes caused me great anxiety, butwarned them that they were on no account to mention it in their papers. Asimilar attitude was adopted with regard to tanks, of which we had none whenwar broke out.Meeting with British Far East Representatives. -61. At the end of September 1941, Sir Earle Page from Australia, theBritish Ambassador in Chungking Sir A. Clark Kerr, and the British minister in Bangkok Sir J. Crosby, were all in Singapore. The opportunity was takento have a combined meeting together with Mr. Duff Cooper and the governor of Malaya in order that the two Commanders-in-Chief might discuss with the mall the situation in the Far East.   A report was sent to the Chiefs of Staff(21).The meeting agreed generally with the views expressed by the Commander-in-Chief, China, and myself, that Japan&apos;s principal asset in the Far East washer foothold in Indo-China, which might be developed as a springboard fromwhich to attack Malaya. Further, that Japan must be anxious to avoid warin the South for the next few months so the time was opportune for bringing pressure to bear on her to withdraw from Indo-China.The meeting emphasised that, in the absence of a British fleet based at singapore, there was little doubt that Japan could strike at her selected moment and stressed the propaganda value of even one or two battleships at Singapore.Various steps were recommended, including the following : .The issue of a co-ordinated announcement by the British, UnitedStates and Dutch Governments that they had a combined plan for actionin the event of a Japanese move against any of their interests in theFar East;Urging the United States to reinforce the Philippines, especially withsubmarines and air forces;Development of our aid to, and plans for operations in, China; andLiaison with Russian forces in the Far East.VI.-CIVIL DEFENCE PROBLEMS IN MALAYA.Food and Water.62. On. my arrival in Singapore I found a large number of Civil defence matters requiring attention. As regards food supplies, a six-months&apos; supply for the whole population, as well as for the Navy, Army and Air Force, was laid down as the minimum requirement. Rice was a constant source of anxiety.The yield of rice in Malaya was insufficient for the whole population, and sosome had to be imported, mainly from Burma, and this again was naturallydependent on shipping. As soon as the year&apos;s crop was gathered, stocks wereplentiful, but the consumption was large arid required constant watching.There was difficulty over the storage of rice for more than six months, but thiswas solved by the introduction of the method of mixing a small proportion oflime with the rice, which, so far as tests went, preserved it for two years withoutdeterioration. There was also the problem of the distribution of rice, some ofthe States producing an excess of their own requirements. The custom hadbeen to store this surplus on the spot, and at one time there was some 50,000tons of rice stored as far North as Alor Star. By the time war broke out,however, distribution was satisfactory.On two occasions, the War Committee decided that a scheme of food rationing in time of war must be prepared.   Committees were formed to carry(21) 225/5 of September 30, 1941.
this out, but on both occasions reported that the difficulties were so great thatfood rationing was impracticable; and, on one occasion, that if it was necessary from the military point of view, it was up to the military to prepare a scheme.The position was certainly complicated, but I did not believe that the difficulties were insurmountable. The fact remains, however, that no satisfactory schemeof food rationing was in force on the outbreak of war.The main source of supply for the water reservoirs on Singapore island was from the mainland of Johore. It was realised that this might be cut, andthe matter was investigated on my arrival. The result of this investigationshowed that the rainfall was sufficient, with certain additional water mains,to supply enough water to meet the requirements of the whole of the anticipatedpopulation of the island, except that water-borne sanitation would have to be stopped. The necessary steps were taken. A sea-water fire service already existed for part of Singapore City.Air Raid Precautions,63. A.R.P. in Singapore had started, and before war broke out I was satisfied that the organisation, as regards fire precautions, demolition squads,rescue parties and first aid, was good. Up to the time I handed over command,A.R.P. functioned well, with one exception. (See para. 101 below.) Up-country,progress was somewhat slower.Black-out in Malaya was difficult. Owing to the construction of most ofthe houses, complete black-out meant shutting off most of the ventilation, whichwas extremely disagreeable in Malayan climate. Consequently, when black-outwas enforced it meant most people living either in darkness or in physicaldiscomfort. In consequence, a system was introduced of having a &quot; brown-out,&quot;a black-out being enforced as soon as warning was received of the actualapproach of hostile aircraft. The brown-out allowed a certain amount of light, sufficient with care to read by without closing up the room. In myopinion, this worked satisfactorily.64. The provision of air raid shelters in Singapore was insufficient for thetotal population, but the construction of these was not a simple matter. Thewater-level was near the surface, so that in most places the digging of trenches wasnot only useless, but dangerous because they soon became filled with water and formed breeding places for mosquitoes. Many of the streets were narrow, andthere was little room for the building of shelters. Quite apart from the blockingof traffic, the medical authorities definitely advised against the building of sheltersin streets, on the ground that the circulation of air would thereby be stopped, thusleading to epidemics.On the other hand, many of the streets of Singapore had footpaths coveredover by the first floors of the buildings, which were supported by pillars from the outside. Provided the houses were of fairly solid construction, filling up thespaces between the pillars with stone or bricks afforded a good type of air-raidshelter. Where none could be constructed, the policy was to provide accommoda-tion in open spaces outside the town, where it was expected that the population would move as soon as bombing started.  Compulsory evacuation was not enforced.Denial Schemes and Evacuation.65. A denial scheme was prepared early in 1941 for the event of an invasion of Malaya, and necessary instructions issued. This scheme was directed princi-pally to the destruction or removal of everything that might facilitate themovement of invading forces. It included such things as the removal of food stocks, or their dispersal amongst the villages, the destruction of any form of repair workshop, as well as the demolition of bridges and the removal or destruction of all forms of vehicle or boat. The plan did not envisage a complete&quot;scorched earth&quot; policy. (See para. 121 below.) For instance, in the case often mines it was only laid down that essential parts of the machinery of dredgeswere to be removed and brought away. A plan for the denial of British-ownedtin mines in th^Kra Isthmus was also worked out by the O.M. Section ofthe Ministry of Economic Warfare, including arrangements with Commander-in-Chief, China, for the evacuation of British personnel by sea after the denialscheme had been carried out.
66. Originally, civil officials were ordered to remain at their posts in theevent of invasion. This, however, was modified in December 1941, enabling thosewho were suitable, physically and otherwise, for service with military units tobe withdrawn, so that they could be used for defence. This also applied to a proportion of the civil medical staff.67. The problem of British families in Singapore and Malaya generallywas somewhat involved. In the case of the Navy, families were permitted for those stationed ashore, i.e., officers in the light cruisers were not allowed to bring their families out to Singapore. In the Army and Air Force, families were allowed in those units which were considered to be the permanent garrison in singapore, which in practice meant the units existing before September 1939.Units which arrived since that date were counted as reinforcements, and familieswere not allowed in their case. This gave rise to anomalies, because some ofthe units, e.g., Headquarters, Malaya Command, and the Royal Air Force depot at Seletar, had expanded very considerably since September 1939, although theywere still counted as part of the permanent garrison. In the case of the families of civil officials and civilians there were no restrictions. Apart from 50 W.R.N.S.at the Naval Wireless Station and a number of nurses, many women were employed in the different services for clerical, cipher and other duties, includingintelligence work in F.E.C.B. Had all these been sent away, it would have meant a large increase in the number of men absorbed. As it was, we were short ofwomen to fill suitable posts and thus relieve men for the fighting units.On the other hand, the presence of large numbers of women and childrenled, in January 1942, to hurried evacuation, with consequent loss of personalbelongings and discomfort, and, later, to casualties.   (See para. 123 belotu.)Kenya and Malaya Contrasted.68. Some criticism has been directed against our relations with the Malaysand Chinese in Malaya, and this is not entirely undeserved. Proceeding to malaya after my experience as Governor of Kenya, I noticed a striking difference.In Kenya, people do not go out to make money or to get rich quickly; they gobecause they are attracted by the country, because they can do things which theycould not afford in England, and because they meet many kindred spirits. In1939, there were over one hundred civil officials who had bought properties withthe object of settling down in Kenya after retirement.Englishmen buy property in Kenya not merely to settle down for their ownlives, but with the idea of handing it on to their children in the same way as anestate in England. They are devoted to the country, and ready to fight for Kenyafrom motives of local patriotism, quite apart from fighting against the enemiesof England. This feeling of affection for Kenya leads to feelings of friendlinesstowards Africans, who in their turn are influenced by the feeling of permanent residence-of the British settlers.The position is different in Malaya. A few individuals may remain in thecountry, mainly because they have been out there so long that they cannot standthe cold of an English winter, but hardly any, either civilians or civil officials,start with the idea of making it their home.The great majority of civilians in Malaya come out with the object of makingmoney and then leaving the country and settling down elsewhere. There is verylittle affection for Malaya itself. Then, the climate undoubtedly. has an adverse effect on people of British race. This is partly due to the high degree of humidityand partly to the small variation of climate between summer and winter, ortemperature between day and night. Englishmen are brought up in a verychangeable climate and they miss this in Malaya, as well as the bracing effect ofcold weather. The effect of the climate varies, naturally, with individuals, butit is very noticeable after a period varying from one to three years. It affectspeople both physically and mentally, and to some extent morally.69. The relations between the Services and the civilian communities were,on the whole, good up-country, but were not happy in Singapore&apos;.- The Servicesthere felt, with some justification, that civilians took very little notice of themsocially, and strongly resented the fact that, whilst they were paying full incometax on their pay, the civilian community in Singapore raised a great outcry when a small income tax (maximum 8 per cent.) was imposed on them. The civilianT23888] e 2
community, on the whole, seemed to resent the presence of the Services as disturbingtheir ordered way of living. There was -reluctance on the part of certain sections of the British community to join the Volunteers; those who did joinwere keen and are reported to have fought gallantly, but, whereas in Kenya mydifficulty was to compel people to remain at their civil jobs, including looking after farms, in Malaya applications to be excused from joining the Volunteers,or at any rate from embodiment, were always reported in the newspapers as&quot; successful &quot; applications.The view held in the Colonial Office appears to have been that rubber and tinoutput was of greater importance than the training of the local forces; forinstance, telegram 1352, dated the 31st December, 1940, to the Governor, states :&quot; The ultimate criterion for exemption should be not what the General OfficerCommanding considers practicable, but what you consider essential to maintainthe necessary production and efficient labour management.&quot;Attitude of Non-British Population.70. With regard to the other races in Malaya, the most numerous were theChinese. Most of them were there to make money, and except for this had no particular roots in Malaya. Before war became probable, it was hard to convince the Chinese of the necessity of making preparations to meet it; for instance,there was difficulty in filling the Chinese companies of the Volunteers up toestablishment, nor could we get a sufficient number of Chinese motor drivers.Their main incentive to participate in the war was that they felt they werehelping. China to fight the Japanese; I doubt if they were actuated by anypatriotic motive for Malaya itself. This may have been partly the faultof the British; there was certainly inadequate appreciation of the fact that,should war break out between Great Britain and Japan, the Chinese would be our allies, and there was not sufficient contact between the British and the leadingmen of the Chinese community. My experience of the Chinese under air bombingwas that they were calm, and with no tendency to panic.With regard to the Malays, their attitude was mainly one of indifference; ifsomebody had to control Malaya they would sooner have the British than theJapanese, but if the Japanese were going to win, they were ready to go about their work under Japanese control.There were several thousand Indian labourers in Malaya, mostly Tamils, whoworked on the rubber estates. So long as they were kept free from agitators,these Tamils were a law-abiding community. They had merely come to Malaya todraw good wages and with the intention of returning to India in a comparatively short time; they had no feelings whatever of patriotism towards Malaya.Some probable fifth columnists were marked down at Kuala Lumpur androunded up at the start of the war; but, except for the cases mentioned inparagraph 105 below, there was very little fifth column work or treachery.There was no difficulty in recruiting for the two battalions of the MalayRegiment, and young Malays who had been specially trained in technical schoolsworked well in the aircraft maintenance unit on Singapore Island, and werenot unduly worried by bombing.On the purely material side, we could point to much that we had done toimprove the conditions of the non-British races in Malaya, especially hospital and medical facilities, anti-malarial measures and education. But with all that,there was on our part a lack of sympathetic understanding of their outlook on life.My impression is that the Dutch in the Netherlands East Indies were more successful than we were, possibly because in their case the colour bar was nearlyabsent.VIL-NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES.China.71. The late Major-General Dennys was appointed Military Attache&apos; inChungking shortly after my arrival in Singapore, with the intention that, whenwar with Japan broke out, he would become head of the British Military Missionwith the Chinese, this being known as 204 Mission. Chiefly owing to his work,seconded by Wing-Commander Warburton and backed by the Ambassador, Sir A,
Clark Kerr, our relations with the Chinese were very satisfactory, and consider-abie progress was made in plans for co-operation, and, to some degree, in theirexecution.Co-operation as regards air consisted mainly in the preparation of aerodromesites and the dispatch to China of stocks of aviation petrol and, finally, bombs, all for British squadrons which it was hoped to send up later. (See para. 26 above.)The aerodrome sites were in three groups : the first in the area north and west ofKunming, the object of which was largely to protect the Burma Road; the second,an area north of Hong Kong, from which it was hoped to assist in the defence ofthat place; and the third, an area further east, from which it was hoped that one day it might be possible to deliver air attacks on Japan. It was only in the first group that these preparations could be called complete when war broke out.Transport was one of the main difficulties, and it was not until the 13th November,1941, that permission was given to send up bombs. The petrol and bombs wereconsigned to the Chinese, who took charge of them.72. The second form of assistance to China was with their guerillas. Itwas agreed that fifteen special Chinese guerilla companies should be formedinitially, and that each should have a squad of fifteen British and Indianpersonnel attached to it. These squads would be specially trained in the use ofexplosives and in carrying out demolitions, and would be kept supplied by us withthe necessary material. It was proposed eventually to double the number ofguerilla companies, and consequently of the squads. These squads went through a thorough training in Burma, including living under the conditions they wouldexperience when operating with the Chinese guerillas.73. The whole organisation for the supply to the aerodromes and to theguerilla squads was based on Burma. It was known first as Chi Base and lateras Tulip. Lieutenant-Colonel McFeat was in charge; his own headquarters were at Rangoon, the training of guerilla squads was carried, out at May my o, and stores of all sorts were sent up to Lashio and to Bhamo. A mechanical transport organisation for forwarding stores and supplies was in progress, but by no meanscomplete in vehicles by the 7th December. Signalling and medical facilities weredeficient for most of the guerilla squads. Tulip was directly under my head-quarters till war with Japan broke out, when it was transferred, as planned, toGeneral Officer Commanding, Burma.74. On their part, the Chinese promised not only to help in the defenceof Burma with the American Volunteer Group (see -para. 25 above), butalso to send troops to Burma if required, and to threaten the Japanese northernflank should they advance against Burma via Chieng Rai. They also promised to help in the defence of Hong Kong by an advance towards Canton.They kept their promises. *75. A Chinese Military Mission visited Burma and Singapore in April andMay 1941, and various Chinese officers also paid visits individually, includingGeneral Mow, of the Chinese Air Force, who was in Singapore from the 19th tothe 25th June, 1941, and stayed in my house. Certain members of my staff visitedChungking.Siam and Indo-China.76. The dominating factor influencing the actions of the Siamese authoritieswas fear. Our attitude towards the Siamese was governed by the desire to keepon as friendly terms as possible, and to encourage them to resist any encroach-ment by Japan. The latter was somewhat difficult because it was quite impracticable for us to take any effective military action to prevent Japanesepenetration of Siam. Further, as the Siamese quite rightly pointed out,, theywere very short of equipment, especially aircraft and anti-aircraft, tank and anti-tank, so that, if they could not get help from us or the United States, therewas little they could do but to comply with Japanese demands. definite proposals were made in October 1941 for giving the Siamese a few weapons, but nothing was actually sent.(22) .     ,The British Minister in Bangkok, Sir, Josiah Crosby, had many years&apos;experience of the Siamese, spoke their language fluently and was genuinely fondof^the people.   It appears now as if Siamese Ministers traded on Sir Josiah&apos;s(as) G.H.Q., F.E., 462/5 of October 29. 1941, to War Office, also C.O.S., F.E., No. 44 ofNovember 25, 1941.
friendly attitude and deliberately deceived him in regard to their intentions.It is aiso possible that, had we adopted a stronger line with the Siamese, theymight have been more favourably disposed towards us. This was suggestedin March 1941.(23) As events turned out, in spite of published statements by the Siamese Prime Minister, they apparently offered no resistance to theJapanese except for a few hours at Battambang on the frontier East of Bangkok,whereas they opposed our troops advancing into the Southern part of the KraIsthmus after the Japanese had landed.Colonel Sura, of the Siamese Defence Ministry, paid two visits to Singapore,the first from the 11th to the 31st July, 1941, and the second late inNovember 1941 when he stayed for a few days in my house. Colonel Sura spokeEnglish perfectly, had been at the Staff College at Camberley, and had beenattached to a British unit for about two years. It is possible that he was playingfalse all the time, but my opinion was, and still is, that, although he might havebeen sent by Siamese Ministers to mislead me as to the attitude of Siam, ColonelSura himself was innocent, and was merely a tool of his superiors who wereplaying a double-faced game. Colonel Sura was still in Singapore when war broke out, and, to the best of my recollection, was interned.77. Whilst in Cairo, I had met General Catroux, who gave me a depressingpicture of the attitude of the French officials in Indo-China. His informationproved correct. He warned me that hardly any of the officials in Indo-china were to be trusted; that, if not definitely anti-British, they were pro-Vichy, thattheir first thoughts were for the safety of their persons and possessions, including their pensions, and that they would make no resistance to Japanese demands.78. At the time of my arrival in Singapore, the Japanese had troops inTongking, at the northern end of Indo-China. This in itself was no direct threat to Burma or Malaya. To some extent it was a threat to the Chinese section ofthe road from Burma fto China, but there seemed some reason to believe thatthe original purpose for which these troops were sent there was to extricateJapanese forces in Kwangsi, who were malaria-ridden and in a difficult position.79. In the latter part of 1940, Siamese Ministers, possibly encouraged by the Japanese, had stimulated their country to demand the return to Siamof certain areas that had been taken by the French some years before. Thiseventually led to a mild form of hostilities between the two countries concerned.Endeavours were made at Singapore by the Governor, Commander-in-Chief,China, and myself to bring about a settlement without posing as officialmediators, but these endeavours were unsuccessful. By the end of January1941, the Japanese had been recognised as the mediators, and thus scored a diplomatic success.80. We had concluded an economic agreement with the Vichy french authorities in Indo-China, and they professed themselves anxious to developfriendly relations. In spite of this an agreement between them and theJapanese was announced on the 24th July, 1941. Its terms allowed the japanese to maintain forces in the South of Indo-China. A Japanese convoy began toarrive at Saigon on the 26th, and by the end of July the Japanese were well established in that town. More important still, this movement gave the Japanesecomplete control of Camranh Harbour, and they quickly started to make orimprove aerodromes to the South and West of.Saigon. As was expected, theJapanese did not limit themselves for long to the terms of the agreement, andthe French authorities made practically no effort to oppose either the originalterms or the successive encroachments. The effect of this expansion on thedefence of the Far East is indicated below (paras. 95 et seq.).VIII.-DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRITISH AIR FORCESIN THE FAR EAST.General Position.81. In their paperf) of the 15th August, 1940, the Chiefs of Staffestimated the air strength necessary for the Far East as 336 first-line aircraft,to which, of course, had to be added reserves.(-3) G.H.Q. F.E. 187/2 of March 30, 1941, to Chiefs of Staff.(24) C.O.S. (40) 592 (Revise), Annex 1, paragraph 66.
In&quot; the Singapore Conference of October 1940, the final strength of theRoyal Air Force recommended for the Far East was 582 aircraft, an increaseof sixteen over that given in the appreciation dated the 16th October, 1940(see para. 42(b) above). The Chiefs of Staff agreed that 582 aircraft was an ideal, but considered that 336 should give a very fair degree of security(&quot;).The figure of 566 aircraft given in the appreciation was stated by the AirMinistry to be far beyond the bounds of practical possibility in the light oftotal resources and vital requirements in active theatres at home and in theMiddle East(26).The strength of the Air Forces in Malaya in November 1940 is as shownin Appendix L; that in Hong Kong and Ceylon was negligible. Of the totalof 88 first-line aircraft, only 48, i.e., the Blenheims and Hudsons, could be counted as modern, and the former suffered from lack of range. The Vildebeesteswhich we had at the beginning of the war with Japan were considered by theChiefs of Staff in August 1940 as having become an obsolete type.(27)The replacement for the Vildebeeste was to be the Beaufort. Manufactureof these had started in Australia and we were to get the first 90. Much ofthe raw material and certain complete parts of these aeroplanes had to comefrom England and from the United States, and there was considerable delay in supplying many of the items. The urgency of the matter was representedseveral times from Australia, and particularly at the beginning of August,when the Prime Minister of Australia sent a special telegram to the AustralianHigh Commissioner in London. In spite, however, of every effort on the partof Australia, Vildebeestes were still in use in December 1941 (see para. 88 below).The flying boats were not only obsolete, but badly in need of completeoverhaul, and the Wirraways could only be considered as training aircraft.But the great weaknesses were the absence of any. fighters and the smallsize of the reserves. This latter even necessitated restrictions on the numberof flying hours in squadrons towards the end of 1940, and the first months of1941. The importance of remedying these weaknesses was emphasised very shortly after my arrival at Singapore,(28) and the aircraft situation waselaborated in a telegram three months later.(29) In para. 5 of this lattertelegram I estimated that, at the end of 1941, we should be able to reckon, asan absolute maximum, on a total of only 215 aircraft, including anticipatedreinforcements of 39 Dutch aircraft, or 176 exclusive of the Dutch.82.   The general deficiencies in aircraft were also emphasised in many othertelegrams, such as : (a) 389/3 of the 30th June, 1941, to Troopers for the Chiefs of Staff;(b) 305/4 of the 18th August, 1941, to Air Ministry; and(c) 359/4 of the 20th August, 1941, to Troopers (see Appendix F).This last contained my comments on the appreciation by General Officer Com-manding, Malaya, of the Army strength required.  The following are extracts : .&quot; This means bluntly that at present not only is our ability to attackshipping deplorably weak, but we have not the staying-power to sustain evenwhat we could now do. As our air effort dwindles (as it would if war camenow) so will the enemy&apos;s chance of landing increase&quot;; &apos;and : &apos;&apos; Nor do I know whether troops or aircraft will be the easier to provide,but I have no doubt what our first requirement here is.  We want to increase -our hitting power against ships, and our capacity to go on hitting.&apos;&apos;The need for more aircraft for the attack of shipping had also been emphasised in a previous telegram(3D) of the 23rd July, 1941.(25) C.O.S. No. 39, dated January 10, 1941, paragraph 3.(26) X901 of October 22, 1940.(&quot;) CO.8. (40) 592 (Revise), paragraph 69.(28) G.I-I.Q. P.E. 40 of December 7. 1940.(20) G.H.Q.

83. The Chiefs of Staff fully appreciated my anxiety about the smallnessof the air forces at my disposal(&quot;), but pointed out that they had had to facedisappointments in production, had to reinforce the Middle East still further- tomeet the probable scale of attack in the Spring, and that the necessity for supporting Russia was likely to impose a further strain on British and Americanresources. Further, that in these circumstances it was clear that neither could the target programme for the Far East be completed, nor, indeed, could anysubstantial reinforcements be sent before the end of 1941.84. This Chiefs of Staffs figure of 336 first line aircraft referred to in para. 81 above, was based on the assumption that Borneo would be defended, buttook no account of the defence of Burma, Whilst the latter was a greatercommitment than the former, I accepted the figure of 336 as the target at whiclito aim in view of two telegrams from the Chiefs of Staff(&apos;12), in both of which thefigure of 336 was confirmed.Fighters.85. Single-seater fighter aircraft, known as the Brewster Buffalo, began toarrive in Singapore in cases from the United States in February 1941, andpermission was given by the Air Ministry to form two squadrons in the firstinstance. These were formed mainly with pilots taken from existing squadrons,who had a good deal of flying experience, and so got up to the operationalstandard much quicker than the two new squadrons formed later; though not upto establishment, the first two squadrons would have been able to fight by themiddle of April 1941. A total of 167 Buffaloes in all were received in Singapore,and on the 30th May, 1941, permission was given by the Air Ministry to formtwo further fighter squadrons.These new squadrons took a long time to become operationally efficient. Themajority of the pilots had to be brought from Australia and New Zealand. they all came straight from the Flying Training Schools, and some from New zealand had never flown anything beyond a Hart, and had no experience of retractableundercarriages, variable-pitch propellors, or flaps. Under these conditions it took over four months from the time that the pilots arrived in Malaya beforethe squadrons could be considered fit for operations; in fact, they had not been passed as fit when war with Japan broke out. It would have helped a great dealif we could have formed a proper operational training unit in Malaya, but I was informed that neither personnel nor aircraft could be spared for the purpose, andthat all the training of pilots would have to be done in the squadrons. As thiswould have seriously hindered the operational training of squadrons, the nucleus of an O.T.U. was formed from our own resources.After the formation of the third and fourth Buffalo squadrons had been started, it was found that the re-equipment of the R.A.A.F. Wirraway Squadronwas going to be delayed indefinitely, and I was requested by Australia to take any possible steps I could to ensure that this Australian squadron was re-equipped with some form of more modern machine than the Wirraway. The only possible course of action was to re-equip it with Buffaloes. This was sanctioned by the AirMinistry(33) and carried out, but five squadrons were definitely too many for thetotal number of Buffaloes available, and overstrained the reserves.86. The Buffalo proved disappointing, at any rate when up against theJapanese Zero ,fighter. This was due partly to technical reasons and partly to incomplete training of pilots. With regard to the former the performance of the Buffaloes at heights of 10,000 feet and over were relatively poor. (SeeAppendix &quot; O &quot;). Whilst it had been realised that the Buffalo lacked speed,it had been hoped that, with good warning system and the comparatively smallarea of important objectives, e.g., the Naval Base, it would be able to reach the height necessary before the arrival of enemy aircraft, and that its betterarmament would enable our squadrons to give a good account of themselves.Whether deliberately or not, the Japanese appear to have sacrificed armourand armament in their Zero fighters in order to save weight, thereby obtaining the advantage of rate of climb and manoeuvrability at heights. In the caseof these two particular types, the technical advantage certainly lay with the(31) CCS. F.E. No. 34 of September 17, 1941.(32) No. 39 of January 10, 1941, paragraph 3, being comments on the Singapore Conferenceof October 1940, and COS. F.E. No. 34 of September 17, 1941, paragraph 2.(33) WX706 of August 24, 1941.
Japanese. Attempts were made to improve the performance of the Buffalo by-substituting -303 for the -5. In addition some trouble was experienced withthe valve gear of the Cyclone engine in the Buffalo, and with the interruptergear of the two fuselage guns. The Buffalo was unsuitable for night flyingowing to the exhaust flames, flame dampers would have been essential for nightflying but were not available. Actually this was not serious as I had laid down that the Buffalo was to be used for day work only, and that, by night, reliancewas to be placed on the A.A. guns assisted by Blenheim fighters.Pilots have been referred to in paragraph 85 above. What the R.A.F.lacked in Malaya was a good proportion of pilots with practical war experience.Apart from forming a leaven when operations started, they could have taughtthe new pilots those niceties of manoeuvre and aiming which just make thedifference between missing the enemy and bringing him down, the type oftraining that can only be given as a result of experience. Again all the Buffalosquadrons were formed in Malaya and there was no squadron with practicalwar experience to set a standard, and it is possible that in some respects ourswas not sufficiently high for modern conditions.87. Apart from the fighter squadron in Burma, we had in Malaya inDecember 1941 a total of four Buffalo squadrons, one Dutch fighter squadron,which arrived on the 9th December, and one Blenheim squadron, the last princi-pally for night fighting. This total was considered adequate both by the Chiefsof Staff and by my own General Headquarters, but results showed that morefighter squadrons were required, largely because the scope of a fighter&apos;s dutieshas widened. One Buffalo squadron was specially trained for Army co-operation,and we really wanted two. I had also agreed with the Commander-in-Chief,Eastern Fleet, that one squadron, which ought to have been a Buffalo, should be trained in the duties of fighter protection for ships. Fighter squadrons are alsothe most efficient type with which to attack enemy aerodromes. To carry out these functions at all adequately, as well as the normal duties of a fighter, atleast seven fighter squadrons were needed in Malaya alone, without allowing fornight fightersLong-Range Bombers.88. The need for long-range bombers had been constantly pressed from thetime I was first appointed Commander-in-Chief, Far East.(34) At that time Ihad merely felt that they would be wanted without having any concrete proposals,but as the Japanese advanced into Southern Indo-China, the object for whichthey would be used became clear and definite. The targets which we wished toreach in Southern Indo-China were just within reach of Blenheim IVs from theNorthern end of Malaya, and of Hudsons, but we had too few of the former andthe latter were required for overseas reconnaissance.Six Beauforts were flown from Australia a few days before the war started,but as these aircraft were not operational, and as the crews required considerableoperational training in their use, the Air Officer Commanding, with my concur-rence, sent all bar one, which was retained in the hope of using it for photographicwork, back to Australia in order that they might continue their training undersuitable conditions.Other Requirements.89. Other requirements which were realised too late were special aircraft for photographic reconnaissance and transport aircraft for facilitating the rapidmovement of squadrons. Photographic aircraft were first asked for in August1941,(3ii) after the visit of a special photographic officer. The Dutch were readyto help us in the second requirement, but once war had started were making full use of their transport aircraft for their own purposes, and we felt the lack of having a few of our own available at very short notice.(36)It was also, suggested at one time that a balloon barrage would be valuable forthe protection of Singapore, especially the Naval Base. Experiments, however,paoved that the climate and meteorology of Malaya were quite unsuitable for theuse of kite balloons.(34) E.a., G.H.Q.

90. The strength and location of the Royal Air Force in the Far East onthe 7th December, 1941, are given in Appendix M and a summary of serviceableaircraft in Malaya on different dates in December in Appendix N.Our most serious deficiency at that time was in reserves, partly of pilots, butprincipally aircraft. It was not only a stock of reserve aeroplanes we wanted, butalso a continuous flow of new aircraft to replace wastage, for aeroplanes must beregarded as expendable material, and there must be a regular, continuous channel of supply. Without these it was impossible to keep the squadrons up to their first-line establishment. Apart from the material weakness, failure to keep upwhat is commonly known as &quot;a full breakfast table &quot; always has an adverse effecton squadrons&apos; morale.91. There were several civil flying clubs in Malaya, and the Air OfficerCommanding had organised for these an Auxiliary Air Force, which did useful work in communication and assistance to the Army in certain aspects of training.IX.-ARMY STRENGTH AND REQUIREMENTS, MALAYA.92. In the appreciation of the situation drawn up by the Commandersin Malaya previous to the Singapore Defence Conference of October 1940, anestimate was made of the total armed forces required on the supposition that582 aircraft would be available for the defence of the Far East. The estimatewas as follows : 26 infantry battalions, including 3 for Borneo.5 field regiments.3 light tank companies.In addition anti-tank units, troops for local defence of aerodromes, volunteerunits and ancillary troops. This figure of 26 battalions was agreed to by theChiefs of Staff in January 1941.(37)-On his arrival, General Percival went thoroughly into the question of thestrength of the Army and, in August 1941, sent his estimate of the strengthrequired.(38) This w-as based on my forecast of the ^strength which the Royal AirForce would reach by December 1941, namely, 186 first-line aircraft as againstthe accepted figure of 336. The observations of my staff on this are given inAppendix F.(39) My general conclusion was that no drastic reduction inGeneral PercivaFs estimate was acceptable until the strength of the Royal AirForce was materially increased. The Chiefs of Staff commented^&quot;):&quot; &quot;we accept estimate by General Officer Commanding, Malaya, as reasonable figure for land forces required in present circumstances. Nevertheless, this targetcannot be fulfilled in foreseeable future.&quot;93. In December 1941, while the actual strength of the Royal Air Force(see Appendix M) approached very closely to my forecast, the Army strength(see Appendix G) fell far short of the figure, based on this forecast, whichwas considered necessary by General Percival, agreed to by me, and accepted bythe Chiefs of Staff.   The main deficiencies were:  17 Battalions;4 Light A.A. Regiments; and2 Tank Regiments.The strength in A.A. weapons in the Far East on the 7th December, 1941,is given in Appendix H.94. The fact that we were entirely without tanks in Malaya was a serioushandicap to any offensive land operations, whether on a small or a large scale.There were also very few armoured cars. Many efforts were made to obtain bothtanks and armoured cars from various sources. On the 14th August the War Officeoffered forty light tanks from the Middle East. These tanks were at the timebeing employed for aerodrome defence, and they were offered to the Far East onthe condition that they would be employed in an operational role, and that we(&quot;) C.O.S. 39, dated January 10, 1941, paragraph 9.(38) Nos. 21671, dated August 2, 1941, and 21776, dated August 16, 1941 (see Appendix F).(39) 359/4, dated August 20, 1941, to Troopers (see Appendix F).(40) F.E. 33, dated September 17, 1941, paragraph 4.
could man them from local resources. Some delay occurred at Singapore in finding the best method of meeting the latter condition. Eventually Australiaagreed to provide the necessary men and to train them up to a reasonable standard in Australia, this training to be completed by the 1st January, 1942.On the 13th November, 1941, however, Middle East reported to the War office that they could not provide forty tanks for the Far East except at the expenseof operational requirements. After war had broken out, War Office orderedMiddle East to send fifty light tanks to India, their subsequent destination tobe decided later.With regard to armoured cars, a model of an armoured vehicle mounted onan American chassis was obtained from the Dutch and six were made in Singapore,chiefly at the Naval Base; drawings were also made and sent to Burma. No more,however, could be made owing to a shortage of boiler plate, which was used forthe armouring. By the 24th November, 1941, a total of 84 Marmon-Harringtonarmoured cars had been shipped from South Africa for Singapore. Some of thesearrived a few days before war broke out, and the drivers had not becomeaccustomed to them before they had to go to the front.The number of anti-tank weapons had improved considerably by the timewar broke out, but there was still a shortage of the 0 - 5 anti-tank rifle in infantryunits.The lack of ^mobile A.A. weapons was serious, especially in view of theshortage of fighters. A constant anxiety to the General Officer Commanding,also, was the continual drain on the Army for men to protect aerodromes. IndianState troops were brought over to assist, but it would have been a great help ifwe had had more armoured cars or even tanks of an obsolete pattern for this duty. This would have enabled us to have a mobile defence and to substitutemechanical vehicles for a large proportion of the men required. The reserve ofsmall-arms ammunition was well below the authorised figure. In November 1941General Headquarters informed the War Office that, with releases in sight, weshould be short of our authorised holding of 150 million rounds by 57 million onthe 1st January, 1942. Australia, who were already sending us 3 million roundsper month, agreed to increase this to 8 million.X.-EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE WAR.The Problem of Japanese Intentions,95. As the Japanese spread South into Cambodia and Cochin China, the potential danger to Burma, Malaya, the South China Sea, and even the Philip-pines, increased; this danger had been realised from the start, and was referredto in a telegram in December 1940.(41) But it was difficult to judge whether this movement signified definite plans for an offensive against us in the near future,whether it was merely the acquisition of a strategic asset to be used in negotiation,or whether it was the first step towards occupation of Siam. This applied even to the construction of aerodromes, of which we were kept fairly well informed;what we were particularly on the look-out for was any indication of movements of long-distance bombers, or of the Zero-type fighters fitted with detachable petroltanks.  These, of course, could be concentrated on the aerodromes at short notice.96. Another difficulty in getting any long warning of the Japanese intention was due to the restriction on exports to, and imports from, Japan. So long asJapanese merchant shipping was being employed on its normal work, F.E.C.B.could keep track of every vessel, and should it be found that an unusual number was being kept in home ports for no good reason, it would indicate the possibility,or even probability, that the Japanese were refitting these ships as transportsprior to an overseas expedition. The effect of the embargo, however, was to driveall Japanese shipping off the seas for purely economic reasons, and once in japanese ports they could be altered as required without our being any the wiser.This applied especially to the fast vessels, i.e., round about 18 knots.In spite of the preparations going on in Southern Indo-China there were some indications at any rate up to the end of November that the Japanese didnot intend immediate hostilities.  The first was a general one, namely, that if the(-&quot;) G.H.Q. F.E. 40 of December 7, 1940, paragraph 20.[23888] f 2
Japanese intended to attack Malaya, they would have been more likely to havedone so in 1940, when our forces were far weaker than they were at the end of1941. Then the winter months, December to February, were less favourable foran expedition against the East coast of Malaya and the Kra Isthmus than otherperiods of the year owing to the North-East monsoon. (See also para. 136 below.)Finally, there was the visit of Kurusu to Washington. It seems now probablethat Kurusu, though possibly innocent himself, was sent to Washington with the deliberate object of misleading the United States and ourselves as to the Japaneseintentions, and keeping us quiet until their own preparations had been finallycompleted. But at the time it seemed to us in Singapore that this was a genuineattempt on the part of the Japanese to get relaxation of the restrictions that had been imposed, and possibly to drive a wedge between Britain and the UnitedStates.  I believe the same view was held in England.97. In the latter part of November information accumulated to show thatthe Japanese were probably intending an offensive at an early date. Four Mogamiclass cruisers with a few destroyers had been despatched from the JapaneseCombined Fleet to the South China Sea. Two squadrons of long-range Zerofighters arrived in South Indo-China. The number of aircraft in Indo-Chinarose from a total of 74 at the end of October to 245 at the end of November. The5th Japanese Division, which was highly trained in landing operations, was reported by the Chinese to have moved to South Indo-China. There were largemovements of motor landing craft from Central China, though there was no definite information as to where they had gone.(42) In addition, a telegram wasreceived from the War Office(43) to the effect that the United States Armycommanders in the Far East had been informed from Washington that the Kurusunegotiations might break down at any time and offensive operations be started by Japan against Siam, the Netherlands East Indies or the Philippines; upto the receipt of this telegram we had remained completely in the dark on thismatter except for press reports.(&quot;)Aeroplanes, almost certainly Japanese, occasionally flew over parts of Malayain the latter part of November and early December, in all probability carrying outphotographic reconnaissance, but owing to the speed and height at which theyoperated we were never able to make contact and obtain definite identification.In view of the continued Japanese developments in Southern Indo-China,which gave them the facilities needed to attack Malaya, precautionary steps were taken on the 22nd&apos; November, and orders were issued for vulnerable points to beguarded, and on the 1st December the Volunteers were mobilised. Certainmovements of air forces were carried out, and reconnaissances over the China Seawere instituted.During this time we felt great need of aircraft capable of doing high-altitude photographic reconnaissance. This applied not only to the aerodromes in Southern Indo-China, but particularly to Camranh Harbour, on which we gotno information whatever. We had no aircraft suitable for the purpose since,though a Catalina could have flown the distance, it had neither the speed northe necessary ceiling. It seemed highly undesirable to aggravate a strainedsituation by sending over an aeroplane which would in all probability have beenintercepted and definitely identified as British. I asked General MacArthur tocarry out a photographic reconnaissance from Manila with one of his BoeingFortresses, which had the necessary speed and ceiling, but he&apos; replied that orders from Washington prevented him from carrying out my request.98. Near the opposite end of the prospective theatre of operations, the island of Timor was important as being a definite link in the air communications between Australia and the Netherlands East Indies. Its occupation by theJapanese would also be a serious threat to Australia. The importance of Timorwas noted in the A.D.A. agreement, and it was referred to in A.D.B. Roughlyhalf the island was Dutch territory and half Portuguese; it was the latter halfwhich gave no small anxiety. The Japanese had a consulate in Dilli, the capital of Portuguese Timor, and by November 1941 had received permission to run a regular flying-boat service to Dilli, and were gradually getting an economic holdon Portuguese Timor.   In November 1941 a small nucleus of Australian troops(42) Commander-in-Chief, F.E., 306/6 of November 28, 1941, paragraph 4.(43) No 54880 of November 29, 1941.(&quot;) Commander-in-Chief, F.E., 299/6 of November 28, 194! to War Office for Chiefs of Staff.
(&quot;) No. 48 of November 29, 1941.was sent to Koepang in Dutch Timor, where there was an aerodrome and a flyingrboat base. On the 12th December one infantry battalion, one independentcompany and a few coast defence troops reached Koepang from Australia. a combined Australian and Dutch force occupied Dilli in the middle of December1941. About the 7th December, in accordance with the A.D.A. and A.D.B.agreements, two flights of Hudsons of the Royal Australian Air Force moved toAmbon in the Netherlands East Indies. These were followed later by an infantry battalion.Order of the Day.99. The Commander-in-Chief, China, and I had agreed as far back as May1941 that it was desirable to prepare an Order of the Day before the war broke out, so that it could reach Burma and Hong Kong in time to be translated intothe different languages spoken by the troops in the Far East and be ready forissue on the first day of war. Drafting this Order presented difficulty because ithad to appeal to men of varying races and religions, e.g., British sailors andBurmese troops. The main object that I had in view when preparing it was tomake an effective appeal to the Indian troops, as I considered it would be necessaryto stimulate them rather than the British. Through information that has reachedme subsequent to the outbreak of war I believe it had the effect it was meant to.The order is given in Appendix P.Approach of the First Enemy Expedition.100. About 1400 hours on the 6th December I received information that an air reconnaissance had sighted two Japanese convoys escorted by warships about80 miles East-South-East of Pulo Obi, an island off the Southern point of Indo-China, steaming West. One convoy consisted of 22 10,000-ton merchant vesselsescorted by one battleship, probably the Kongoo, five cruisers and seven destroyers;the other of 21 merchant ships escorted by two cruisers and ten destroyers.Further West, one Japanese cruiser and three 10,000-ton merchant ships hadbeen sighted steering North-West. I consulted with Admiral Sir Geoffrey Laytonand Admiral Palliser, Sir Tom Phillips&apos; Chief of Staff, and we concluded thatthe probability was that the convoy would not continue its course due West,which would have brought it on to the Kra Isthmus, but that it would follow thefirst four vessels and round Cambodia Point. It was pointed out that there wasa good anchorage on the West Coast of Indo-China at Koh Tron, which theymight be making for as the next step towards Siam.Bearing in mind the policy of avoiding war with Japan if possible apolicy which had been reaffirmed by the Chief of Staff as recently as the29th November(&apos;15) and the situation in the United States with the Kurusu talksstill going on in Washington, I decided that I would not be justified in ordering&apos;&apos; Matador &apos;&apos; on this information, but orders were issued to bring all forces to thefirst, i.e., the highest, degree of readiness. I also impressed upon the Air OfficerCommanding the urgent necessity for maintaining contact with the convoy, apoint which he had already realised.The location of these forces by Hudsons of No. 1 Royal Australian Air ForceSquadron, based on Kota Bharu, was a particularly good piece of work in viewof their being at the limit of their patrolling range, over 300 miles from the malayan Coast. This same factor of distance, however, made it impossible forthem to remain in contact until relieved, but a Catalina Flying-boat was despatched to shadow the convoy during the night. The Air Officer Commandingalso ordered a reconnaissance by Hudsons starting early on the 7th December,fanning out from Kota Bharu on to the last known bearings of the convoy. Nosignal was received from the Catalina, and, from information received later, itis almost certain it was shot down. A second Catalina failed to make contact with the convoy. On the morning of the 7th December, visibility East and north-East from Kota Bharu was good. The reconnaissance found no ships inthe area between Kota Bharu and the Southern end of Indo-China, thus confirmingthe supposition that the convoy had rounded Cambodia Point, and had followed the four leading ships North-North-West into the Gulf of Siam. In this Gulf thevisibility was very Bad and no positive information was received from this areauntil the evening, when a report was received that a Hudson had seen, through
low clouds, three small Japanese ships which were then passing Singora andheading south. This information reached me about 2100 hours. I metGeneral Percival and we proceeded together to the Naval Base; I decided notto order &quot;Matador&quot; for the reasons given in my Signal (1605 2/7 copy inAppendix Q). I had also received a telegram from Bangkok, which, emanatingas it did from the British Minister to Siam, could not be completely ignored.The text is given in Appendix R.It is pertinent to record that, until the Japanese had committed some definiteact of hostility against the United States, the Dutch or ourselves, permission hadnot been given to attack a Japanese expedition at sea.XI. THE START OF HOSTILITIES.The Opening Day.101. Clear evidence that the Japanese had, in fact, taken the plunge intohostilities was soon forthcoming when, at 0130 hours on Monday, the8th December, the Japanese started to land from about ten ships at Kota Bharu.I received this news at about 0200 hours in my office at the Naval Base, Singapore,and the necessary steps were at once taken to put everything on a war footing,including the internment of Japanese. Later on, reports were received that theJapanese were landing large forces at Singora and Patani in the Southern partof the Kra Isthmus.At 0300 hours on the 8th December Singapore was attacked by Japanesebombers, which, in all probability, came from Southern Indo-China. In one case, at any rate, they came over in a formation of nine at a height of between12,000 and 14,000 feet, without dropping any bombs, apparently with the objectof drawing the searchlights and A.A. guns away from a few other aircraft which, flying at 4,000 to 5,000 feet, attacked objectives on Singapore Island,mainly aerodromes, with practically no results. An attack was also made on theEastern part of Singapore Harbour, possibly in mistake for the aerodrome atKallang; this attack caused a number of casualties, killing about sixty, mostlyChinese.The observation system worked satisfactorily, and thirty minutes&apos; warning of the approach of. Japanese aircraft was received at my headquarters. Forsome reason that wTas never cleared up, the headquarters of the A.R.P. organisa-tion had not been manned, and it was only a few minutes before bombs weredropping on Singapore that contact was made by Fighter Group headquarters and the sirens sounded giving the warning for black-out. In my opinion, theabsence of black-out had but little effect, since there was a bright full moon, andthe coastline and most of Singapore must have shown up very clearly.Apart from this failure in Civil A.R.P., there was no tactical surprise, since,as has been stated above, the troops were all in readiness, and the black-out wascarried out at all Naval, Army and Air Force establishments.102. In the morning of the 8th December the weather was clear over theland and close to the coast, but out to sea there were clouds down to 500 feet.No. 1 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force, at Kota Bharu, aided by theVildebeestes of Nos. 36 and 100 Squadrons, carried out a vigorous offensive against the Japanese vessels and landing craft. Reports showed that these attacks had a considerable measure of success, many landing craft in the Kota BharuRiver being sunk, and a ship reported to have contained tanks being sent to the bottom.No. 62 Squadron from Alor Star also went out to attack the same target, but,owing probably to being ordered too far from the coast, failed to locate the enemy ships near Kota Bharu and proceeded to the neighbourhood of Patani on the KraIsthmus. Here it was met by a greatly superior force of Japanese Zero fighters,and, though Japanese ships were located there and bombs dropped on them, the attack was probably ineffective.On the Western side in Kedah reconnaissance forces of the 11th Divisioncrossed the Siam frontier in the afternoon of the 8th December and made contact with the enemy, who were already employing 10 A.F.Vs. After inflictingcasualties, our forces withdrew in the afternoon, demolishing bridges on their wayto the frontier.   Further South a force known as Kroncol also crossed the
frontier beyond Kroh in order to take up a position on the Siamese side of the border as originally planned. Both these forces met with some opposition fromthe Siamese.Meanwhile, in spite of resistance on the beaches and further back, the enemy had made progress at Kota Bharu, until by 1600 hours the aerodrome was sothreatened by Japanese troops that our aircraft had to leave and fly to Kuantan.103. A feature of the opening day of hostilities was the enemy air attack upon our Northern aerodromes. Gong Kedah, Machang, Penang, Butterworth.Alor Star and Sungei Patani aerodromes were all attacked, the total scale of enemy effort for the day being estimated at some 150 aircraft, of which probably65 per cent, were fighters. Of these attacks, the most damaging were againstAlor Star and Sungei Patani, several aircraft on the ground being rendered unservicable in both cases and most buildings at Sungei Patani destroyed. Bothaerodromes were henceforth unable to operate and had to be vacated.The attack on Alor Star was made by a formation of 27 twin-enginebombers of the Army type 97, and started about twenty minutes after the return of No. 62 Squadron from their attack at Patani and whilst the aircraft wererefuelling. The Japanese attacked from a height of about 13,000 feet and usedpattern bombing, the bombs being partly high-explosive, mostly about 150 lb.,and partly incendiary. The attack was very effective; some ten of our Blenheimswere put out of action, four being completely written off. The fuel dump aridsome buildings were set on fire, and, as the water supply was put out of action,the fires were not extinguished till dusk. Casualties were small,&apos; only seven men being killed. Alor Star was defended by four 3-inch 20-cwt. guns, but they failedto bring down any Japanese aircraft, possibly owing to the height at which theywere flying.9th-llth December.104. Broadly speaking, assaults on our aerodromes, coupled with freshlandings in Siamese territory, continued to be the main feature of theJapanese operations for the first two days of the war. The enemy was greatlyhelped in them by the prompt use to which he put Siamese aerodromes, ourreconnaissances on the 9th and 10th December revealing concentrations of somesixty aircraft at Singora and eighty to a hundred aircraft at Don Muang,Bangkok. On the 9th December eleven Blenheims attacked Singora aerodrome,but they were met by a greatly superior force of enemy fighters and five of our aircraft were brought down; the results of our bombing were not observed..Aircraft of No. 62 Squadron, which had moved back to Butterworth at dawnon the 9th December, were also ordered to attack Singora, starting at 1700 hoursthe same day. Butterworth was attacked by Japanese aircraft just as ourswere about to take off, and, although Buffaloes were up, considerable damage was caused, with the result that only one Blenheim left. The pilot, Flight-Lieutenant Scarf, reached and attacked Singora, but was badly wounded; heflew his aeroplane back, landed at Alor Star and died a few minutes later. &quot;On the 9th December our aircraft were forced to vacate Kuantan owing to enemy bombing, though it was still used for refuelling. Already by this date itwas clear that the success of the enemy&apos;s attack on our Northern aerodromeswould considerably handicap our own air action, and that this in turn wouldunfavourably prejudice our fortunes in the fighting on land. Interference withSingora landings was made difficult, once our Northern aerodromes hadsuccumbed by our lack of bombers of adequate range. In a telegram to london from General Headquarters(46) a warning was given that it was unlikely weshould find it practicable to maintain the existing air effort for more than twoor three weeks.Dutch air reinforcements arrived in Singapore Island on the 9th; theyconsisted of three squadrons Glen Martin bombers, total 22 aircraft, and one squadron of nine Buffalo fighters. It was found necessary to send eight of the bombers back to the Netherlands East Indies to complete the training of theircrews in night flying.105. The 8th Brigade, defending Kota Bharu, was pressed back on the 9th,demolition being carried out before the aerodrome was evacuated.   By the end423/6 of December 8, 1941.
of the day it was forced back to a line in Kelantan running Peringot-Mulong.The enemy was employing infiltration tactics and working round the flanks ofour forces wherever possible. The 8th Brigade had put up a stout resistanceround Kota Bharu, and its commander, Brigadier Key, was faced with a difficult problem in deciding when retreat would become necessary. (See para. 140 below.)The decision having been made, the Brigade was disengaged skilfully.Japanese Army, reinforcements meanwhile arrived on a considerable scale.A large force, consisting of transports escorted by a battleship, three cruisers and eleven destroyers, was sighted by our aircraft between Kota Bharu and thePenhentain Islands on the 9th December. North of Kuantan the Japaneselanded in small numbers at Beserah during the night 9th/10th December. these were driven off, and by 0845 on the 10th December all was quiet there. Thegeneral situation in regard to Japanese landings was thus that all successfullandings took place North of the Malaya-Siam frontier, except that at KotaBharu. which, as already stated in para. 12 above, had no road communications to Southern Malaya, and depended for reinforcements from the South on therailway alone.By the 10th December it was evident that the enemy&apos;s primary object wasthe establishment of air superiority in Northern Malaya, whilst at the same time he was testing our defences on a wide front. It was estimated that the japanese were now employing about 30 Zero-type fighters from Patani and about70 aircraft, mainly Zero fighters, from Singora. All but about 50 of the Japanesebombers previously based in Southern Indo-China had presumably been moved to Siam.A complication of the situation which gave some anxiety at this date wasthat our efforts might be impeded by lack of support, or even actively hostilemeasures, among native elements. Native labour tended to disappear for days after bombing, and non-British railway employees, including engine-drivers,deserted,temporarily on a large scale; the Army was able to replace the driversto some&quot; extent. There was reason to believe that some Malays were acting asguides to the Japanese. On the 10th December a signal detachment of theJohore Military Forces at Mersing, which had been in no way affected by thefighting, deserted and carried out sabotage, and on Singapore Island speciallights were apparently being shown to guide enemy aircraft. But these proved to be isolated acts of hostility, and they did not spread.   (See para. 70 above.)106. By the 11th December the 8th Brigade, in Kelantan, retiring along theroad which meets the railway at Kuala Krai, was in a position covering Machang.In Kedah a new threat was opening in the form of enemy infiltration from Siam,especially in the Chaglun area. This advance into Kedah, coupled with theheavy air attacks on Penang, indicated that the Japanese main attack wouldbe down the road communications of Western Malaya. Advanced troops of the11th Indian Division were in position South of a line Chaglun-Kodiang, whileKrohcol sought to hold off the enemy in this more central region. Some of thedemolitions that had been prepared in Northern Kedah failed to be effective;this was not due to any failure to act in time, but to some technical fault either in the fuses or explosives. All our serviceable aircraft had now been withdrawnfrom Northern Malaya. It was estimated that by the 11th December the japanese were employing in Malaya at least two divisions; supported by 250-300 aircraft.H.M.S. Prince of Wales and Repulse.107. H.M.S. Prince of Wales and Repulse arrived at Singapore on Tuesday,the 2nd December, 1941, Admiral Sir Tom Phillips having arrived by air two days before. He and I had no opportunity for full consultation over the situationbefore war broke out, partly because he was taking over from Sir Geoffrey Laytonas Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet, and partly because he visited Manilaby, air to meet Admiral Hart.H.M.S. Repulse left to pay a visit to Port Darwin on the 5th December, andit was agreed she should proceed the first 48 hours at comparatively slow speed.She was recalled as soon as the air reconnaissance report of the 6th December wasreceived, and arrived back in Singapore on the 7th December. The naval forcesat Singapore on the 7th December are given in Appendix D.108. Admiral Phillips decided to take action with his two capital ships.So far as my Headquarters was concerned he was put into direct touch with
the Air Officer Commanding with regard to the air co-operation required, and asked for three things: (a) Reconnaissance 100 miles to north of the force from daylight, Tuesday, the9th December;(b) Reconnaissance to Singora and beyond&apos; ten miles from the coast startingat first light on the 10th December; and(c) Fighter protection off Singora at daylight on the 10th December.The Air Officer Commanding gave tentative replies that he could provide(a), hoped to be able to provide (b), but could not provide (c). It was decided thathe should go thoroughly into the problems involved and give definite replies to theChief of Staff, Eastern Fleet, Rear-Admiral Palliser, who was remaining behind.Air Officer Commanding later confirmed his tentative replies and this information was sent on by signal to Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet, in the evening of the8th December. The doubt about (b) was due to the fact that the reconnaissancewould have to be provided by Blenheim IVs based on Kuantan aerodrome, and itwas uncertain whether this would be out of action or not. Actually, both thereconnaissances were carried out, though one of the Blenheims doing (b) hadwireless troubles.The reason why (c) could not be provided was mainly that the northernaerodromes were either untenable or else had been badly damaged by bombing;this meant that the fighters would have to operate from aerodromes at considerable distance from Singora, and, owing to the short endurance of the Buffalo, theywould have been able to remain only a very short time over that area before having to return to refuel. The Dutch fighter squadron had.not arrived by the 8th; itwas uncertain whether it would be available by the 10th and thus there was ashortage of fighter aircraft. These factors meant that a short patrol might possibly have been provided at intervals at Singora, but that it was impossible to guarantee continuous fighter protection.109. The Prince of Wales and Repulse, accompanied by four destroyers,left Singapore in the afternoon of Monday, the 8th December. Early on the10th December a signal was made to Singapore indicating that the ships would return earlier than originally planned. Except for this, no communication wasreceived and their position remained unknown until, shortly after twelve noon onWednesday, the 10th December, a signal was received from Repulse that she wasbeing bombed in a position about 60 miles East-South-East of Kuantan. on receipt of the message a fighter squadron was at once despatched and reached theposition of the ships in commendably quick time, but only to see the Prince of wales go down. No enemy aircraft were spotted. Fighter cover, thoughonly a weak one, was provided for the destroyers that picked up the crews fromthe sunken ships. *110. I had been asked by Rear-Admiral Palliser to give an indication of thestrength of the&apos; air force that the Japanese might bring against these two ships from Indo-China, and gave an estimate of between 50 and 60 bombers, whichmight be expected to arrive five hours after the ships had been first located byreconnaissance. Whether this information was ever received by the Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet, I do not know.111. I feel it would have been better to have regarded this operation as a combined one Navy and Air-and not merely a Naval one with such air co-operation -operation as could be provided.The ships were attacked by high-level bombers and torpedo bombers, thelatter being by far the more effective. It is possible that the high-level bombers were used with the object of attracting any of our fighters that might have beenwith the ships away from the torpedo bombers. The Japanese would probably have expected that such fighters would be flying high, and that they would naturally attack high-level bombers in the first instance, thus giving sufficient time for the torpedo bombers to get in their attack before our fighters could getdown to them. Admittedly, this is conjecture, but it is on similar lines to the bombing attack carried out on Singapore Island early, on the 8th JUecember. it also indicates the value of the dive bomber as a third alternative method of attacking ships, thereby giving greater facilities for surprise.
112. The psychological effect on Malaya of the loss of these two ships was somewhat mitigated by the fact that shortly after they arrived I had summoneda Press conference, and talked to those present on the following lines : &quot; The arrival of the two capital ships in no way reduced the need forcontinuance of every effort being made to improve the defences of Malaya and singapore; indeed, it enhanced the importance of this effort. Warships mustnot be tied down to their base; they must be free to operate to the full limit oftheir range of action and know that they can still return to a safe basewhen necessary. These ships would be of value to the Far East as a whole,but must not be regarded in any sense as part of. the local defences of malaya and Singapore. Further, in the same way as these ships had arrived fromdistant stations, so, if the situation changed and they became needed else-where, we had to be prepared for them to be ordered away.&quot;Based on this, the local papers published good leading articles, bringing outthe particular points I made. In addition, Mr. Duff Cooper, at my request,gave an excellent broadcast on the evening of 10th December, pointing out thatthe loss.of these ships must not lead to despondency, but merely to a determination to fight all the harder and so avenge their loss.Japanese Command of the Sea.113. From the point of view of the defence of the Far East as a whole,what was more serious was the Japanese attack on the United States Pacific fleet in Pearl Harbour. In appreciations of the situation we had always relied on the deterrent effect of the existence of this Fleet, even if the United States werenot in the war from the start. It was expected that this deterrent would preventthe Japanese from allotting more than a limited number of warships for escort duties, which fact would limit the number of convoys sent into the South ChinaSea, and that it would also stop them from sending an expedition round the Eastside of the Philippines towards the Netherlands East Indies, especially theEastern islands.An indirect result of the Pearl Harbour attack was to prevent the surface.ships of the Asiatic Fleet from Manila co-operating with British and Dutchships in the Java and South China Seas in accordance with the A.D.B. agreement.This Asiatic Fleet was, by orders from Washington, limited to operations betweenSourabaya and Port Darwin.As a final result, the command of the sea acquired by the Japanese was greater than we had ever anticipated. We were, in fact, fighting under conditionsof which the British Empire had very little previous experience.Penang.114.   Penang Island was of no small importance for three reasons : (a) Very fair port facilities.&quot;(b) Stocks of ammunition and stores.(c) The point of departure of two Overseas cables.It was decided that true defence of Penang was on the mainland and that,should the forces in Kedah be driven south, direct defence of Penang would beof no value. This enabled most of the garrison of Penang to be released to reinforce the mainland. One of the great weaknesses of Penang lay in the factthat there were no A.A. guns, which was entirely due to shortage of weapons.It had been laid down that the Naval Base, Royal Air Force aerodromes,Singapore Harbour and Kuala Lumpur had to have priority above Penang, andthere were not enough to go round.There was no analogy between Penang and Tobruk. Even had the garrison of Penang held out for some weeks, it would have been entirely isolated bothby land and by sea, and could not have carried out any attacks against theJapanese line of communications except possibly an odd spasmodic raid. Anytroops that might have been utilised for a garrison under these conditions wouldhave been more valuable elsewhere.115. The first attack on Penang was at 1100 hours on the 8th December,when the aerodrome was bombed by Japanese aircraft, the effect generally being
small.&apos; At 1000 hours the 11th December, Georgetown was bombed and heavy casualties caused among the native population; these were due not so much toany inadequacy of A.R.P. as to the fact that the native population turned out into the streets to watch the sight, presumably under the impression that anotherattack was about to be made on the aerodrome. As a result nearly the wholenative population left the town and the labour problem became acute. Next day the military authorities had to take over many civil duties, including burialof the dead, and the naval authorities had to work the ferries between the island and the mainland.116. In view of the situation in Kedah, it was decided to move women andchildren, other than Malays and Chinese, from Penang on the 13th December.This was intended to apply to Indians as well as Europeans, but owing to some misunderstanding the Sikh Police were not given the opportunity to send theirwomen and children away, and in the end only the Europeans left, the total numbers being about 520.At 2030 hours, the 15th December, orders were received by the military commander at Penang to destroy all military stores, &amp;c, that could not be movedand to come away with the remainder of the garrison and British civilians.About half a dozen British residents were left as they did pot wish to move.The native Volunteers were given the option of moving, but most of them decidedto remain with their families in Penang; the British personnel of the Volunteerswere brought away.The coast artillery denial scheme was carried out and all 6-inch gunsdestroyed. Approved armament was withdrawn and most first-line transport.Electrical machinery and the oil fuelling system of the Eastern SmeltingCompany were smashed, the river house, telephone exchange, cable and wireless station and aerodromes destroyed. The Singapore-Colombo and the Singapore-Madras cables were, however, connected by binding screws and left working inthe hope that the Japanese might not discover them a hope that proved vain. Areserve of food was opened for the civil population, which had suffered some600 killed and 1,100 wounded in air raids during the last week.The destruction of material was incomplete, the most notable example beingcertain vessels that were left intact. Efforts were made by the naval authoritiesLo immobilise these by laying mines in the Southern Channel, the Northern alreadyhaving been mined by the Japanese.  Presumably this was not effective for long.The story of Penang from the commencement of the war until the evacuationcannot be regarded as a satisfactory one; this was partly, if not mainly, due to lack of co-ordination between the Services and the civil authorities. The OfficerCommanding, Penang, Brigadier Lyon, submitted a report to the General OfficerCommanding making certain criticisms of the civil authorities, but none had beenreceived from the civil side before I left. *XII. THE RETREAT FROM NORTHERN MALAYA.12th-18th December.117. By the 12th December enemy pressure on the Kedah front was becomingvery severe. The Kroh forces were being forced backwards over the frontier,while our right in Northern Kedah was also driven back, necessitating the6th Indian Infantry Brigade withdrawing on the left to conform and hold aline River Bukit (north of Alor Star) to Pinang. Penang was the subject of daily air attacks at this period. Two days of heavy fighting them saw our forcespushed back twenty miles south of Alor Star, the 11th Division taking up aposition in the Gurun area. Some of the infantry units in this division reportedlosses up to 50 per cent., but this included missing, many of whom rejoined later.The immediate preoccupation on our part at this moment was to co-coordinate the movement of the 11th Division with that of Krohcol. Unless this was donethere was serious danger of the Japanese cutting off one of the two forces.Krohcol was now back in Kedah just east of Baling and under the command ofthe 12th Indian Infantry Brigade, which had been sent up from the south asreinforcements. But on the 16th JUecember the enemy drove in between the Krohforces and the 11th Division, and counter-attacks by two battalions of the28th Indian Brigade proved unavailing to restore contact. It was now that the[23888] g 2 .
lack of adequate reserves to relieve troops who had been fighting continuously fora week began to be felt. The enemy were pressing home their attacks in spite of heavy losses. Troops from Penang were sent up as reinforcements, while the6th and 15th Indian Infantry Brigades had been so weakened in the fightingthat they were ordered to re-form into one composite Brigade.The Japanese were now employing Kota Bharu aerodrome, reconnaissancerevealing some forty of their fighters on the ground. To attack Kota Bharu,Singora and Patani aerodromes with the object of reducing the scale of Japaneseair effort was part of our general air policy at this period, but our bomber effort was painfully limited by our lack of aircraft. Apart from deficiency of adequateA.A. weapons, the defence of our aerodromes was handicapped by lack of adequate warning in the North. (See para. 54 above.) These formed twocauses of our heavy losses of aircraft on the ground. The retention of our mainfighter strength for the defence of Singapore (see para. 144 below) was a contributory cause and also reacted directly on our bombing effort, since it was impracticable to provide fighter escorts.Two Buffaloes had been specially fitted for photographic reconnaissance.To allow of extra petrol being carried, and at the same time to reduce weight, allguns were taken out. Even then the Buffaloes were inferior in performance to theJapanese Zero fighters. The pilots of these specially fitted aircraft carried outuseful work under very difficult conditions.Erom the start of hostilities the Dutch submarines had been very active. Onthe 12th December one of them reported sinking four enemy troopships at PataniRoads.118. The difficulty of combating the Japanese attacks on our aerodromesresulted on the 16th and 17th December in the evacuation and demolition ofButterworth, Taiping and Kuantan aerodromes, and our aircraft were forcedfurther South. Ipoh, too, was now being bombed, and the aerodrome petrol dumpwas hit;On land, the enemy, having advanced in Kelantan (as far as the Sungei Nal)and in Kedah, was now also attacking detachments of our troops in Perak roundabout the Grik area. The 3rd Indian Corps was accordingly authorised to with-draw behind the line of the Perak River to protect the communications of our forces North of Kuala Kangsar. The 11th Indian Division began withdrawing from the line of the River Muda Southwards behind River Krian, linking up with the 28th Indian Infantry Brigade and protected all the time on the right flank by the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade. During this period the Argyll andSutherland Highlanders made counter-attacks with gallantry and skill. Thiswithdrawal was carried out successfully, the enemy being repulsed with loss athis first attempt to cross the river.*Inter-Allied Conference, December 18.119. On the 18th December a conference of inter-Allied representatives tookplace at Singapore, in accordance with proposals made by President Roosevelt.Owing to the time factor, China was not represented. Results of the conference were telegraphed to England. (47)  The main conclusions were as follows :  (a) The importance of Singapore to the war in the Ear East, and to the world war, could not be exaggerated;(b) The immediate plan was to dispose our combined forces then available inthe Far East so as to (i) Keep the enemy as far North in Malaya as possible and hold him&apos; in the Philippines; and(ii) Prevent the enemy acquiring territory, and particularly aero-dromes, which would threaten the arrival of reinforcements;(c) Our urgent and immediate need was for reinforcements, which must beon a scale not only to meet the present scale of attack, but also thatlikely to be put in the field against us;(d) It was recommended that the United States convoy at present directed to Brisbane should proceed to Sourabaya, where aircraft would be assembled and flown on to destination;(17) No. 89, Duchy, of December 20, 1941, from Singapore to Foreign Office.
(e) It was desirable that the Chinese should be asked to maintain themaximum pressure on the Japanese in order to contain as manydivisions as possible, and subsequently to provide bases for long-distance bombing attacks on Japan.Finally the conference considered that the situation, though serious, neednot give rise to undue pessimism provided the necessary reinforcements were supplied in the available time, but time was the essential feature.(&quot;)Reinforcements.120. From the 8th December, 1941, onwards many requests for reinforce-ments had been made from General Headquarters, Far East. The time factormeant that reinforcements had to come from the Middle East, India and convoysalready at sea rather than from the United Kingdom. Complicated quadrangularreferences between Malaya, India, the Middle East and London were henceentailed, but Commander-in-Chief, India, was most helpful in appreciating theneed for diversion to Malaya of forces originally intended for his owncommand.(&quot;) A sub-committee of the Inter-Allied Conference, having consideredall the previous requests for reinforcements, agreed on the following immediate requirements for Malaya to stabilise the situation(50) : A in 4 Fighter Squadrons;4 Bomber Squadrons;1 Photographic Flight;1 Transport Flight; and reserves at 100 per cent, for fighters and 50 per cent, for bombers,plus aircraft to complete existing squadrons and their reserves.Land 1 Brigade Group;1 Division;Reinforcements for 9th and 11th Divisions;3 Light A.A.

(One fighter squadron ex convoy W.S. 12 Z with 18additional pilots);24 Blenheims.   (One squadron from Middle East);52 Hudsons (from United Kingdom);While measures were in hand aiming at the release of a further 3fighter squadrons from the Middle East, and for 80 4-enginedUnited States bombers.Land. 2 Infantry Brigade Groups ]       IndiaReinforcements for 9th-llth Divisions   )8.5th Anti-Tank Regiment complete   &quot;j6th Heavy A.A.

1 Light tank squadron (17 Light tanks and reserves) ex India;53rd Infantry Brigade (18th Division), guns and transport of whichwere to follow after arrival of personnel;1 Machine Gun Battalion and reinforcements for the A.I.F. Brigadesex Australia;Provision of further tanks was under discussion, while General Head-quarters, Far East, was also pressing strongly for the complete18th Division.Five Blenheims from the Middle East and four Hudsons from Australiaarrived in Singapore on the 23rd December, 1941.19th-25th December.121. In accordance with instructions from London, a scorched earth policy was ordered at this period instead of the denial scheme referred to in para. 65above.The general situation on land by the 19th-21st December was that our troops were trying to keep the enemy West of the River Perak, while at the same timepreventing him advancing further South than the River Krian. To this end the 11th Indian Division, which it was considered essential to maintain as a fighting formation, was holding a line along the River Kuran with the28th Indian Infantry Brigade, and also protecting Kuala Kangsar with the12th Indian Infantry Brigade, a detachment of which was also further Northalong the Grik road. The Division as a whole was suffering from exhaustion,damaged feet and loss of equipment. The 6th and 15th Indian infantry brigades were now re-formed at Ipoh as the composite 15th Infantry Brigade,while a composite battalion of the 2nd/16th and 3rd/16th from these two brigades was in Corps Reseiwe. The Kelantan forces, 8th Indian infantry brigade, 9th Indian Division, had suffered about a hundred casualties in eachbattalion, and were now along the railway at Manik Orai. Of elements notthus far engaged in the main pperations, the 22nd Indian Infantry Brigade(9th Indian Division) was at Kuantan, while the Australian 22nd and27th Brigades were responsible for Johore, and the 1st and 2nd Malay infantry brigades for Singapore Fortress. None of these last four Brigades could be despatched North to relieve the hard-pressed 11th Indian Division, for the reasons give below.   (See -para. 140 below.)122: Heavy enemy air attack was now falling on Ipoh aerodrome, and ourown fighters were driven further South to Kuala Lumpur (Selangor). attacks on our road and rail communications were becoming an increasing feature of theJapanese air operations. Reconnaissance revealed that the enemy was now makinguse of Sungei Patani aerodrome, where thirty fighters were discovered. our aircraft were making night and dawn attacks on enemy aerodromes, and were very valuable for reconnaissance; reconnaissances were regularly being made (a) 350 miles N.N.E. of Singapore;(b) along the East coast of Malaya;(c) over the Rhio Archipelago; and(d) to the Miri and Kuching areas from Sinkawang;in addition to those over the fighting area.By the 21st^-22nd December Kuala Lumpur was coming in for heavy air attack, though little damage was at first inflicted. Against an attack by Ju. 87&apos;son the 21st December the Buffaloes were more successful, causing the Japanesebombers to break formation in disorder, but to deal with the Zero fighters it was apparent that only the speedy arrival of Hurricane reinforcements, while we still held sufficient air bases, could turn the tide.The land situation in the next few days (21st-23rd December) witnessedfurther advances by the enemy in all areas. Pressure along the Grik road washeavy, in spite of severe losses inflicted during a successful clash on the night ofthe 19th/20th December.The Japanese floated troops down the Perak River by night, and on the22nd December the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade was forced back South ofKuala Kangsar. The 28th Indian Infantry Brigade was also pressed in thesame direction, small detachments only being left North of Kuala Kangsar and
West of the Perak River. Bridges were destroyed as the troops retired. while this was taking place on the Perak front, the Kelantan withdrawal was alsocontinuing, the 8th Indian Infantry Brigade retiring South of Kuala Kraialong the railroad. A problem similar to that of Krohcol and the 11th Divisionreferred to above (see para. 117) now arose in regard to 8th Indian infantry brigade and the main body of III Corps in Perak, and, to a lesser degree, inregard to the force at Kuantan and the 8th Indian Infantry Brigade. It wastherefore decided to withdraw this 8th Brigade much further South into CentralMalaya, and it took up completely new positions in the Kuala Lipis-Raub area.A small party known as &quot; Macforce &quot; was left with an armoured train at Dabongto withdraw down the railway, demolishing it as they went. The Kuantan force was ordered to prepare to withdraw Westwards at short notice. On the23rd December all our fighters on the mainland were withdrawn to Singapore,Kuala Lumpur and Port Swettenham being kept as advanced landing grounds.The enemy was also occupying various points down the East coast of Malaya,and had proceeded from Kuala Trengganu to Dungun. By the 25th Decemberit would be true to say that something like one-half of Malaya had passed from our control., 123. With the object of maintaining the morale of the civil population of malaya I held a meeting on the 22nd December, attended by members of theLegislative Council, leading men of the different communities and the Press, thetotal number being about 120. (See Appendix S.) The main points I stressedwere that the available strength had proved inadequate; we had to remember thatthe aircraft, A.A. guns and tanks that might have come to Malaya were not beingwasted, but were being used with great effect in Libya and Russia; that therewas every reason for confidence that, now the requirements of the Far East had become pressing, those responsible were taking steps to ensure the despatch of adequate reinforcements of men and material; and that it was up to everyone toensure that no effort was spared to hold up the enemy until the necessary forcesarrived.On the 22nd December a telegram was sent to Mr. Duff Cooper to the effectthat useless mouths were to he evacuated from Singapore without racial discrimination and on a voluntary basis so far as the general population were concerned.The total number of British women and children evacuated from Malayafrom the beginning of the war with Japan to the 31st January, 1942, was asfollows : 7,174 European;2,305 Indian; and1,250 Chinese.According to a Japanese report, the number of British women and children left in Singapore at the time of capitulation was about 200.XIII.-THE ATTACK ON, AND FALL OF, HONG KONG.124. On the 8th December, at 0800 hours, hostilities began with the launching of a Japanese air attack on Kowloon. Frontier demolitions were accordingly blown and our troops withdrew according to plan as the Japanesecrossed the frontier on a broad front during the course of the morning. It was estimated that the enemy were employing a force of one division, with thepossibility of increasing this to two divisions with the troops then in the area.There was no enemy action from the air or sea during the night of the8th-9th December, but heavy pressure was exerted against our forward troopsalong the Taipo Road. During the day of the 9th December these troops were compelled to withdraw within the Gin Drinkers&apos; line in consequence of their left flank being turned: Enemy air attacks during the day, directed mainly againstthe south coast of the island, did little damage. Leaflets, too, were dropped. Theday closed unfortunately, since the Shing Mun Redoubt, held by Royal Scots,was suddenly captured at 2300 hours an unexpected blow in view of the difficultyof approach over such country at night. It was considered that local fifthcolumnists must have guided the Japanese in this attack. One company ofWinnipeg Grenadiers was now despatched to reinforce the Kowloon Brigade.
It was soon found necessary, in view of enemy pressure, to readjust the linesouth-west of the Jubilee Reservoir, where the enemy was making progress, andto vacate Kai Tak aerodrome, after the two remaining aircraft had been demolished. During the morning of the 11th December, however, after the twoleft companies (Royal Scots) at Kowloon had been driven in, and reserves(including Winnipeg Grenadiers) had failed to effect more than a temporaryhalt, it was decided to withdraw from the mainland, with the exception of Devil&apos;sPeak. This withdrawal was successfully carried out, beginning at dusk on the11th, and included &apos;howitzers, mechanical transport and armoured cars. Someinterference by Kowloon Chinese fifth columnists was experienced. Stonecutter&apos;sIsland, which had been heavily bombarded and had suffered damage to the militarybarracks, was also evacuated during the night of the llth-12th. Hong KongIsland itself was now also the subject of bombardment, both from the air and byartillery, the main target being the naval dockyard.125. During the night the 12th-13th December troops were withdrawn fromDevil&apos;s Peak, our last post on the mainland. Coast defence guns were now usedlandwards for counter-battery work against the Japanese. It was noted that theevacuation of Kowloon had considerably disturbed the morale of the Hong Kongcivil population, and defeatest elements came to the fore. It became necessaryto organise rice distribution. The Japanese Commander-in-Chief demanded the surrender of Hong Kong, which was refused.During the 14th December the Japanese shelling of the island increased inseverity, and several of our gunposts were hit, as a result of which some Chinesegunners- deserted. The enemy was now enjoying the use of Devil&apos;s Peak as anobservation post. On the same day Aberdeen was bombed from high-level, andthe generating station was hit, though not put out of action. Considerable trouble was still being experienced with the civil population, the police were unableto prevent robbery by armed gangs in the A.R.P. tunnels and rice distributionwas a difficulty. Propaganda was accordingly circulated about the proximityof a Chinese advance to relieve Hong Kong: the Chungking Governmentsrepresentative was most helpful in maintaining order.During the night of the 14th-15th December the Japanese continued theirsystematic shelling, and gathered together a collection of small craft inKowloon Bay. . The Thracian entered the Bay and sank two river steamers, while a special agent succeeded in blowing up a third ship. The Thracian, however,in view of damage, had to be beached and dismantled the following day.On the 16th December Aberdeen was heavily bombed, eight times in all, withresulting loss of one Motor Torpedo Boat and damage to the dock. Most of ourAuxiliary Patrolling Vessels were now useless in view of desertion by Chinesecrews. The enemy landed parties on Lamma Island, and started concentrations of troops on the mainland at Customs Pass and Waterloo Road, but these were dispersed by our artillery. During the night of the 16th-7th mortar fire damagedsome of our machine guns along the water-front.On the 17th December Hong Kong Island was twice raided by fourteen Armylight bombers, coinciding with heavy bombardment by artillery. After this raidthe Japanese again came across with proposals of surrender, which were rejected.126. The night of the 17th-18th was very quiet, but on the 18th decisiveevents took place. The North face of t,he Island was subjected to continuousartillery, mortar and dive-bombing attack, some of our infantry defence postsbeing struck three or four times. Hospitals were badly hit and much damage was done to water mains, roads, cables and signal communications, also rice stores.Stanley and Murray Barracks were bombed in two raids by nine and six bombers,roughly 100 bombs being dropped the largest number to that date. Much of thetransport of the 1st Battalion Royal Scots was destroyed, and C Battery PlottingRoom O was demolished by a direct hit. The civil Government centre was alsodive-bombed. It was following this intense activity that, after dusk, the Japaneseeffected landings at Quarry Bay and across the Lei TJ Mun in the north-easterncorner of the island.The following day the Japanese infiltrated over the hill to the Wong NeiCheong and Tytam Gaps with pack artillery and mortars. Our artillery fromthe Collinson and D&apos;Aguilar areas (east and south-east of the Island) were successfully withdrawn to Stanley (south of the Island), but were compelled to destroy their heavy guns and equipment. Our line, ran now from Stanley Moundnorthwards, Stanley Mound itself being held by one battalion of Canadians, two companies of Indian infantry and some miscellaneous artillery and machine guns.
During the afternoon of the 19th a counter-attack was attempted, with the help of motor torpedo boats, to regain possession of Mount Parker and MountButler, but broke down through heavy enemy shelling, failure of intercommunica-tions and the exhaustion of our troops. Our motor torpedo boats were successful in destroying landing craft in Kowloon Bay, but two were lost in the operations.127. On the 20th our line was still roughly North from Stanley Mound. a communique was again issued to inspire civilian morale with belief in near reliefby Chinese forces. By the 21st the enemy was attacking strongly across MountNicholson through Middle Gap, and our troops were suffering greatly fromexhaustion, the wet and cold of the night-time, and isolation from food andammunition stores. Counter-attacks on the enemy rear by the Royal CanadianRifles came to nought, and Winnipeg Grenadiers were also unsuccessful in an effort to retake Wong Nei Cheong Gap. The enemy still paid attention from theair to the Dockyard area, and practically all Naval personnel were now ashoreand took their place in the land fighting. Japanese naval forces blockading the island consisted of two cruisers, two destroyers and two torpedo boats.It was during the 21st that the &apos;&apos; Resist to the end &apos;&apos; message from the PrimeMinister was received, followed by instructions from the Admiralty to wreck alloil installations and storages.The 22nd December witnessed a fresh enemy landing on the north-east coast of the Island. Part of our force was now cut off in Stanley, while variousremnants were still holding out in isolated positions. The Japanese were nowvirtually surrounding Victoria, where a great deal of damage had been inflictedby bombing and shelling. Oil installations were destroyed, but it was found impossible to do so at Lai Chi Kok, since a large hospital would have beenendangered. A telegram was received from the Admiralty giving the full text of Mr. Churchill&apos;s message, but also leaving to the Governor the discretion of surrender when resistance could no longer be usefully continued.128. By the 23rd December the principal reservoirs were in the hands ofthe enemy, and the connections of those that remained under our control were damaged through shell-fire. Great efforts were made to effect repairs, but, in theabsence of any substantial success in this direction, only one day&apos;s supply ofwater remained to the beleaguered city. Food stores, too, were greatly depleted.Our troops had become more or less exhausted, though Royal Marines managed to recapture ground on Mount Cameron (protecting the South of Victoria), whichhad been heavily bombarded by the Japanese, and the Middlesex beat off an attackon Leighton Hill. The enemy, however, penetrated through the A.R.P. tunnelsand street fighting began at Wanchai. The conduct of the civil population, whichhad thus far suffered some 4,000 casualties (1,000 killed), was, however, good andhad become increasingly so since the first depression after the evacuation of the mainland.On the same day the forces isolated in the South of the Island made an effort to counter-attack towards Stanley Mound, but to no avail.On the 24th December the Royal Scots, following heavy enemy attacks, were driven off the top of Mount Cameron, and Leighton Hill was captured afterbombardment.  The position in the South of the Island was unchanged.On the 25th December, in the early hours of the morning, street fighting tookplace as the enemy fought his way towards the centre of the town, but anotherJapanese demand for surrender was refused. Two hours later, however, theGovernor was advised by the Military and Naval commanders that furthereffective resistance could not be made, and, after carrying out a series ofdemolitions, our forces were ordered to lay down their arms. The Chinese kepttheir word and had endeavoured to assist the defence of Hong Kong by advancingon Canton, but their force was not strong enough to produce any serious effect onthe Japanese.XIV.-OPERATIONS IN BURMA AND SARAWAK.Burma.129. A fresh field of operations opened in Burma on the 9th December,when a landing was reported at Prachuabkhirikun, a clear threat to Mergui andthe Tenasserim Peninsula. ,
On the 11th December, Tavoy was bombed. A further enemy landing atChumporn (Siam) gave access to the southernmost tip of Burma, and an advance on Victoria Point threatened. In the next two or three days the Japanese advancematerialised and coincided with raids on Mergui by about fifty aircraft,propaganda leaflets being dropped as well as bombs. An effort was made to cutoff the Japanese advance southwards by crossing the Siam frontier to demolishthe railway a few miles south of Prachuabkhirikun, but the strength of theopposition and the heavy rains proved too great for the success of this expedition.The situation was still in an undeveloped stage, but with a clear threat to southern Burma,&quot;when on the 15th December Burma reverted to the province ofthe Commander-in-Chief, India.  (See para. 29 above)Sarawak.130. The general problem of the defence of Borneo was indicated in para. 16above. The oil denial scheme was put into operation at the outbreak of war and completed by the 11th December. The landing ground at Miri was also demolished and the forces at Lutong evacuated by sea to Kuching in H.M.S. Lipis.The Company of 2/15 Punjabis rejoined the rest of its Battalion, which formed the regular garrison of Kuching and the remaining individuals fromthe 2nd Loyals and S.S. Police were brought on to Singapore.Considerable anxiety and uneasiness was felt by the authorities in Kuchingowing to the absence of Naval and Air Forces. It was pointed out to them,however, that many places in England had stood up to bombing without any direct defence, and that they would be expected to do the same. It was evident,however, that the morale of the population of Kuching was in a bad way. This,in my opinion, was partly due to the fact that the ruler, Rajah Brooke, was absent actually in Australia. He,had a great deal of influence with the natives,and in view of the situation he should have returned to his country immediately on the outbreak of war, if not before. As it was, the Sarawak Rangers provedquite unreliable, and the 2/15 Punjabis were left to carry out the defence by themselves.The complete control of the South China Sea exercised by the Japanesereduced the problem of the capture of Kuching to a mere calculation of thestrength necessary to overcome the resistance that they would probably meet.They appear to have attacked it with the equivalent of one Brigade Group.131. Japanese naval forces were not long in appearing in strength beforeMiri. By the 16th December, some ten warships had been sighted in company with a tanker off Miri and Lutong, and these ships became the object of ourattacks. On the 17th December, 6 Glen Martins and 5 Buffaloes of the netherlands east Indies Air Force delivered an attack from Sinkawang, but scored neitherhits nor near misses. The same day, Dutch bombers from Samiuwkoa locatedand attacked this force, a Dutch navy Dornier scoring a direct hit on a destroyer.Encounters between Dutch Buffaloes and the Navy Zero fighters revealed the clearsuperiority of the Japanese aircraft. Reports of a Japanese landing at&quot; Lutongand Baram Point were received, and on the 18th December renewed attacks on enemy shipping in this area were made, without success, by a mixed force. EightGlen Martins from Sinkawang had to return without delivering their attackowing to the bad weather. The following day 6 Netherlands East Indies GlenMartins claimed a hit on a cruiser and some near misses. The 19th December,however, was also marked by Japanese air attacks, Kuching aerodrome and townbeing bombed by about 15 heavy bombers and one seaplane. Civilians sufferedapproximately 100 casualties, while the main material damage was the destruc-tion of the Borneo Company Benzine Stores. The air war was also carried toDutch Territory by a heavy attack on Pontianak, much of the city being destroyed.An expedition clearly aimed at Kuching was then sighted on the23rd December, and 5 Blenheim IVs, attacking this on the 24th December, scoredone hit on a transport and some near misses. Air support from Sinkawang wasno longer possible in view of the damage to the aerodrome from a Japanese attack,and the Dutch aircraft Avere withdrawn to Palembang.The 2/15 Punjabis carried out demolitions on the aerodromes, held up theJapanese for a time, and eventually moved in accordance with orders, along ajungle path, to join up with the Dutch, though this necessitated abandoningpractically the whole of their equipment. v
It was noteworthy that Malay labour at Kuching disappeared as the courseof operations approached the area.According to later reports, some 800 of the 2/15 Punjabis joined the dutch and were still fighting with them at the end of January 1942.XV. SPECIAL FEATURES OF THE OPERATIONS.Changes in Commands.132. A large number of changes took place shortly before or shortly afterthe war with Japan started.   These were as follows : (a) Admiral Sir Tom Phillips replaced Admiral Sir Geoffrey Layton onthe 6th December.(b) On the 10th December, after Sir Tom Phillips had gone down with the prince of Wales, Sir Geoffrey Layton who was then actuallyon board his ship about to start for Australia on his way home resumed command.(c) On  the  6th  November   I  was  informed  that   &apos;&apos; owing  to  recent developments in the Far East, it had been decided that the dutiesof Commander-in-Chief should be entrusted to an Army officer withup-to-date experience.&quot; My successor was to be Lieutenant-GeneralPaget. This prospective change became generally known, in theArmy and Air Force in Malaya by the end of November.(d) On the 29th November a signal was received from Whitehall to theeffect that General Pownall had been substituted for General Paget.(e) On the 15th December the responsibility of the defence of Burma was transferred from the Commander-in-Chief, Far East, to Commander-in-Chief, India.(/) On the 29th December General McLeod was replaced by GeneralHutton as General Officer Commanding, Burma.(g) On the 10th December Mr. Duff Cooper was appointed as Cabinetrepresentative in the Far East, and instructions were received by him that a War Council was to be formed under his leadership.These changes may have been inevitable, and it could not, of course, havebeen foreseen that they would coincide so closely with the start of the war, butthey did add to the difficulties of the situation.War Council.133. The composition of the War Council, the formation of which was started on the 10th December, was as follows : Mr. Duff Cooper, Chairman;H.E. the Governor of Malava;C-in-C, Far East;C.-in-C, Eastern Fleet;G.O.C. Malaya;A.O.C., Far East.and later, Sir George Sansom, as being responsible for propaganda and Press control.The War Council did useful work in several directions, but as it was nqtformed until after the war began there had been no time to work out itscorrect functions. Actually, the composition led to its dealing rather too muchwith the details of what was happening in Malaya, whilst it would have been more useful if it had concentrated on the wider problems.On the 16th December a Civil Defence Committee was set up to review anddeal with all measures affecting the defence of Singapore other than those ofa purely military character.  Its composition was : Mr. Duff Cooper, Chairman;Fortress Commander;Inspector-General of Police; andOne civilian.[23888]
Intelligence.134. Turning to intelligence, perhaps the most serious error was oneinvolving the broadest aspect, namely, the intention of the Japanese Government.From the tactical point of view in Malaya there was no surprise, but from the wider point of view there was. Whilst in General Headquarters we alwaysrealised the possibility of the extreme military party in Japan forcing theircountry into war, we did not believe, till the end of November, that Japan mightbe actually on the verge of starting war.  (See paras. 61 and 96 above.)As indicated in paragraph 76 above, there was also some error regardingthe intentions of the Siamese Government.135. As regards the more local intelligence, the forces that the japanese would have at the beginning for an attack on Malaya were estimated with afair degree of accuracy, but there was an under-estimate of the power of theJapanese to attack several places simultaneously. Before the war it wasconsidered that the Japanese might attack in force either the Philippines (with or without Hong Kong), or Malaya or the Netherlands East Indies. It wasnot anticipated that they would attack in force both the Philippines and Malayasimultaneously; still less that they would also attack Pearl Harbour. So faras I could gather from telegrams, this opinion was also held in England, atany rate up to the last few days before war started, though I believe the embassy in Tokio held a more correct view of the Japanese power to attackseveral places simultaneously.136.. There was also an under-estimate of the efficiency of the JapaneseArmy and Air Force, particularly in the following points : (a) Their disregard of weather conditions, especially their ability to landon beaches in bad weather.   Also they appear to have been but little,   hampered by the flooded state of the country in the Southern endof the Kra Isthmus;(b) Their mobility.   This was due to several causes.   The Japanese Armyseemed generally to depend less on mechanism than ours and to be content with a smaller proportion of artillery. The men neededonly simple food and were able to live largely on the country and apparently required nothing in the way of comforts. In some cases they used lighter weapons including a mortar that was lighter than our 2-inch mortar. As a result the Japanese Army was able to operate with less mechanical transport than ours and so was lessdependent upon roads. The whole organisation could be kept lesscomplicated than ours and more flexible;(c) The individual initiative of the Japanese soldier;(d) The performance of the naval single-seater fighter known as the Zerotype. This had a detachable petrol tank under the fuselage andthe Japanese got much value from the long range thus given to it.In spite of this complication, its speed and manoeuvrability at heightsof 10,000 feet and over were remarkably good; and(e) The rapidity with which repairs were carried out, in particular ofbridges and aerodromes. This last affected the strength of theJapanese air force in the Singora area at the South end of the KraIsthmus in the early days of the war.These under-estimates were not attributable solely to errors on the part ofF.E.C.B., but also to those of other bodies, including my own general headquarters.Japanese Army Tactics and Training.137. With regard to tactics, in general the Japanese endeavoured toinfiltrate or outflank.  They made use of certain novelties such as : -(a) A type of light infantry screen acting in advance of their main body.The men were very lightly clad, had but little equipment and werearmed with a light automatic weapon, the calibre of which was some-thing under 0 - 3; they carried only about forty rounds of ammunition and a few hand grenades. These light infantry parties used to workindividually, would get round to the rear of our advance troops, and
resorted to such expedients as climbing trees from which to fire theirautomatic or throw hand grenades. Our men frequently mistook theselight troops for Malays or Chinese, but it is doubtful if the Japanesesoldiers were deliberately disguised as Malayan natives;(b) The use of noise, including Chinese crackers and strange cries at night;these tricks, though laughable when one knew about them, had acertain amount of moral effect, especially on young Indian troops atthe commencement of the campaign; and(c) Inflatable rubber belts to enable men to cross creeks and small rivers.To combat these tactics the General Officer Commanding, Malaya, stressed the importance of discipline and steadiness, the necessity for alertness andcunning on the part of the individual, and that the way to defeat the enemy wasto attack or counter-attack him on every possible occasion. &quot;Essentially war of movement and attack, and too much digging creates defence complex.&quot; (SeeAppendix T.)138. An anti-white campaign had started in Japan in 1936, and it was evident that for long before the commencement of the war the spirit of hatredof Europeans, particularly the British, had constantly been inculcated into theJapanese soldiers. They appear to have been taught that the killing of Europeansby any method was a patriotic action.It is possible that had we adopted the same course some men might have fought harder at the start, but it is difficult to inculcate the spirit of hatred intothe Englishman. This is partly due to his peculiar faculty of seeing a jest in themost depressing circumstances, and partly to the fact that hatred is ultimatelybased on fear, which is not a natural characteristic of our race.Factors affecting Morale of our Forces.139. The majority of the Indian regiments laboured under some disabilityon account of the inexperience of most of their British officers. As a rule, therewould be two or three senior officers, with fifteen or more years&apos; experience, then a gap until we came to officers who had joined after September 1939. Somewhereabout half these officers had experience in India and could talk the language,but having only from one to two and a half years&apos; service they did not carry the weight which more experienced officers would have done.In both British and Indian units there was only a small leaven of war-experienced officers and men, and it was under these conditions that young soldiershad to meet the first shock of the Japanese attack.140\ A factor which had some effect on morale generally was that,strategically, we were on the defensive; everyone know that it was to our interests to avoid war with Japan, which meant that the initiative and especially choice of moment for opening hostilities rested with them.As stated above, the Matador plan provided for a tactical offensive, providedadequate warning could be obtained. As events turned out, the execution ofMatador was impracticable, and later events confirmed that the decision not tocarry out this operation was correct.(51)Then, owing to the comparative weakness of our forces in Malaya we couldneither afford heavy losses up North nor send up there more than limited reinforce-ments, because of the necessity for retaining a force to defend Southern Johoreand in the last resort the island of Singapore itself. This was not the result ofa sort of fortress-complex, but because the essential factor was preservation ofthe repair and other facilities in the Naval Base. The opinion held in london on this point was made perfectly clear in the latter part of December when theChiefs of Staff telegraphed : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government agree your conceptionthat vital issue is to ensure security of Singapore Naval Base. They emphasise that no other consideration must compete with this.&quot;(52)Holding Northern Malaya was not an end in itself; it was with reference tothe Naval Base that Northern Malaya acquired its importance. This meant thatCommanders in the North had to bear in mind the possibility of withdrawal in(51) 151/7 of December 27, 1941, from Commander-in-Ghief, Far East, to War Office,paragraph 6.(S2) CCS. No. 63 of December 22, 1941, paragraph 1. .
the face of superior forces, their action at any rate until Johore was reached being mainly a delaying one to gain time for the arrival of reinforcements from overseas. This applied particularly to the Kelantan area, and to a lesser extent, to Kuantan, since in both cases (as stated in para. 12 above) the line ofcommunication was a single one and vulnerable to air bombing.141. It is easy to talk of the lack of an offensive spirit and of a &quot; retreat-complex,&quot; but under the conditions described above withdrawals from the Northwere necessary; and the adverse effect induced by having to carry out a continuousretreat over some hundreds of miles starting from the early days of the campaignmust be attributed to the general situation rather than to any fault in the originalmorale of the troops themselves.It is possible, however, that the need for offensive action even during aretreat had not been so stressed during the training of officers and men as tobecome a second nature. For instance, there appeared to be a tendency to usereserves for supporting a weak portion of a defensive position rather thanretaining them at all costs for bringing about a counter-attack. Again, up tothe time I handed over command, there was a tendency to use the IndependentCompany in Malaya as a reinforcement and not to carry out the functions forwhich it was specially intended. Further, officers and men must be taught thatoccasions will arise when some parties have got to hold oft to the last man, eventhough the main body of the force may be moving back.&quot;Royal Air Force problems.142. With regard to the Air Force, reference has already been made in paras. 81 and 90 above to the obsolescence of our Vildebeeste aircraft and to theeffect of lack of reserves. Apart from this, the necessity for rapid evacuation ofthe Northern aerodromes had some effect on the ground personnel, many of whom were young and inexperienced. There were insufficient rifles or Thompson guns to equip all Air Force personnel, but they must be prepared to fight, and, ifnecessary, sacrifice themselves in the same way as the infantry; and further,must spare no effort to ensure that all material that can possibly be moved isdespatched, or in the last resort destroyed, to prevent its being of value to theenemy.143. The Royal Air Force suffered from lack of staff. It was not so much that more officers were required at headquarters as that sufficient should havebeen available to form another Group Headquarters. A Fighter Headquartershad been formed and operated well, but the rest of the operations had to becarried out direct by Royal Air Force Headquarters, with the result thatpractically all the headquarters air staff officers had to be employed in theoperations room, and, including the Air Officer Commanding, were fully occupied in working out details of bombing and reconnaissance, leaving no one to plan and think ahead. This condition would have been improved had it been possibleto form another group to operate the bombing squadrons, or, possibly, naval co-operation and overseas reconnaissance, as well as all bombing.144. As aerodromes in Northern Malaya became untenable there was a danger of those, in the South becoming too few to allow of adequate dispersal of the Royal Air Force Squadrons. The possibility of this had also been foreseensome months before war broke out, and it had been decided in such an eventualityto move the bombing squadrons to Dutch aerodromes in Sumatra, retaining mostof the fighter squadrons on Singapore Island. Up to the time that war broke out this remained little more than a project owing to the Royal Air Force staffbeing fully occupied with other work. At the end of December, however, the plans were well advanced, not only for the move of these squadrons but also forthe possible establishment of an erecting depot in Java.145. The need for preserving an adequate force for the protection of theNaval Base (see para. 140 above) applied especially to the Royal Air Force. Thisaccounts for the comparative weakness of the fighter strength in Northern Malayaat the start of the war and for fighter escorts not being available for our bombers.From the last week in December air protection for reinforcement convoys absorbedmost of our fighter strength.
Defence and Denial of Aerodromes.146. As indicated in para. 105 above, the primary object of the Japaneseappears to have been to get command of the air, principally by the attack on our aerodromes by aircraft, or by their capture. The weakness of our aerodromedefence is referred to in para. 117 above. In regard to A.A. weapons, as aresult of the experiences in Crete, I laid down that the defence of aerodromeswas to take precedence over everything else except the A.A. defence of the naval base. It was decided that the full scale of defence would be eight heavy and eight light A.A. guns; this was altered after war broke out to four heavy and twelve light, a scale that was hardly ever approached.147. When our aerodromes had to be abandoned, steps were naturally takento render them useless to the enemy, particularly by explosives in runways andother parts of the landing area. The effect of this action was generally ofdisappointingly short duration. The Japanese were certainly quick in carryingout repairs, but, even allowing for that, the results of many of the demolitionsas carried out seem hardly to have repaid the energy expended and the adversemoral effect on troops of hearing explosions behind them. A system of delay-actionmines would probably have been effective provided they could have been properlyconcealed; preparations would have been necessary for this at the time the aerodromes were constructed. A heavy tractor drawing some form of deepplough or scarifier and working in between craters would have been a very useful addition; it could not have gone on working to the last moment, unless it was intended to abandon the tractor, since these could only move very slowlyand were likely to block roads if left to the last.At aerodromes located in wet or low-lying areas, mines should be locatedwith reference to the drainage system with the object of dislocating it and soputting the aerodrome out of action for a long period. Aerodromes in ourpossession were occasionally rendered unserviceable for about twenty-four hoursby Japanese bombing of runways; this would have been much more effectivehad delay-action bombs been used.Left-Behind Parties.148. An attempt was made to organise left-behind parties in NorthernMalaya with the object of obtaining information and carrying out sabotage ofall sorts in the enemy&apos;s rear. This duty was entrusted to the O.M. Section ofthe Ministry of Economic Warfare under Mr. Killery. It was, however, startedtoo late and there was no time to organise it thoroughly. This was in no way the fault of the O.M., but was due to the factors mentioned in para. 9 above.Question of a. Military Governor.149. A discussion arose at one time as to the desirability of appointing a Military Governor. This might have been desirable for Singapore Islandduring the later stages, but I was of the opinion that such an appointment forthe whole of Malaya at the start of the war was not a practicable proposition.The main reason was that the organisation of the Colony, with the Federatedand the TJnfederated States, was very complicated and that it was not a practical proposition for anyone to take it over at short notice. It would have, beenfound far more practicable for Hong Kong.Australia&apos;s Assistance.150. The Australian Government fully realised the importance of Singaporeto the defence of the Far East and especially to Australia and did everything intheir power to help. In November 1940 there were three squadrons of the royal australian Air Force in Malaya. In December 1940 the Australian War Ministervisited Singapore and saw &quot;General Headquarters telegram F.E. 40 of the7th December, 1940, to the Chiefs of Staff. Largely as a result of his representa-tions, the Australian Government despatched the&apos;22nd Brigade, AustralianImperial Forces, to Singapore in February. The 27th Brigade followed later, and arrived on the 20th August. Besides these valuable reinforcements, Australia sup-plied officers for the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve for administrative work on aerodromes, men for two reserve mechanical transport units in the spring of 1941
and. for the forty tanks which we had hoped to get from the Middle East. Thesituation regarding Beaufort aircraft has been mentioned in para. 81 above,and small arms ammunition in para. 94. In addition to this, Australiaalso supplied many items of signalling equipment and special radio sets for coast defence guns. After the war started four Hudsons from Australia reachedSingapore on the 23rd December and Army reinforcements were promised. (see para. 120 above.)The Dutch.151. The Dutch in the Netherlands East Indies faithfully executed their share of the agreements and, indeed, went beyond them, and co-operated whole-heartedly with us in every way. They sent three bomber squadrons and onefighter squadron in the early days of the war in Malaya, although, owing to technical troubles they were having at the time with their engines, the bomber squadrons consisted of only six aircraft, the whole three, therefore, beingequivalent to little more than one British bomber squadron. Their submarinesoperated with great gallantry in the Gulf of Siam. They also gave me three oftheir reserve flying boats to make good our losses, and sent over a guerilla bandto Northern Malaya to operate in the Japanese rear.At a later stage in the operations I believe they were somewhat critical ofthe amount of assistance we were able to send to the Netherlands East Indies,and of the length of time before it arrived; should this give rise to any acrimonyin the future, I hope that the prompt and whole-hearted assistance they rendered to us will not be forgotten.Work of General Headquarters.152. In Malaya the operations of my own Headquarters were limited tothe issue of certain directives to the General Officer Commanding and Air OfficerCommanding. These laid down such matters as the withdrawal ;from Kelantanand Kuantan, and priority of tasks for the Royal Air Force. Apart from that,the main work was to secure the proper co-ordination of air operations with theDutch and Australia.A great deal of the time of my small staff was taken up at the beginning bythe drafting of Sitreps telegrams and communiques, as well as preparing appre- &apos;ciations demanded from England. One of the problems regarding the two formerwas the fact that they had to be sent to Australia as well as to England; theirtiming was, therefore, a matter of fine adjustment, since it was necessary to.ensure, for instance, that a communique should not be printed in Australiannewspapers before the Sitreps telegrams arrived in England. Eventually, it was found simpler to hand over most of this work to the combined Army and Air Forceoperations room, in so far as Malaya itself was concerned, and General Head-quarters Sitreps communiques were confined to the situation as a whole.Although my General Headquarters operated at the Naval Base at thebeginning of the war, it was found that, after the loss of the Prince of - wales and Repulse and the formation of the War Council, it was more convenient for my Headquarters to be located near the Combined Operations Room. Prepara-tions had been made for this some months before, and the necessary accommodationwas available.   The move was carried out about the 15th December.153. After the transfer of the defence of Burma to Commander-in-Chief,India, and the fall of Hong Kong, it was felt that the location of General Head-quarters should no longer be in Malaya, since to keep it there would not onlyhamper its own work but cramp the initiative of the General Officer Commandingand Air Officer Commanding and make the organisation in Singapore too top-heavy.It was decided before I left that the correct location of General Headquarterswould be in Java, preferably near Bandoeng, and steps were already in hand to effect this move. The possibility of a move away from Singapore becomingnecessary had been foreseen many months before.154. The results of the campaign in the Far East naturally gave rise tosome speculation as to the advisability of forming what may be called StrategicHeadquarters, devoid of all responsibility for direct operational control or administration. Commander-m-Chief, Middle East, at the time I passed throughCairo in November 1940, stated that, in his opinion, such a General Headquarters
was impracticable. My view is that, under special conditions such as existed inthe Far East, a strategic General Headquarters was a workable proposition,provided its limitations are fully recognized.-In para. 5 above were indicated the measures which it was expected to achieve by the creation of a General Headquarters, Far East. We failed to convince the Japanese that our strength was too great to be challenged with success; the limitation of the forces, especially aircraft, that could be sent to theFar East was imposed by prior requirements elsewhere.Co-operation in Malaya and co-ordination of effort with neighbouring countries, including plans for mutual reinforcement, were achieved.Mentions.lob. The only one of my subordinate commanders whom I have been ableto consult on the subject of mentions is the former General Officer Commanding,Burma, Lt.-General Sir K. McLeod. It has therefore been quite impracticable to compile a full list of those officers and other ranks deserving of mention inthis despatch and I have confined the names to my own staff and to Burma. the list is given in Appendix U. The work for which these mentions are made was almost entirely preparation for the war.Farewell Order.156. I handed over Command of the Far East to Lt.-General Sir HenryPownall on the 27th December, 1941, and left Singapore, in accordance with instructions, on the 31st December.I end with my farewell order which was published on the 28th December,1941.To All Ranks of the Army and Air Force, Malaya.On relinquishing the Far East Command I send to you all in theArmy and Air Force in Malaya a message of farewell, of admiration forthe way you have faced danger, fatigue and hardship, and of all good wishes for 1942.I know my successor well, and I turn over the command to good hands.Remember that upon the issue of this war depends the welfare of thewhole world, including our own families. Their eyes are upon you. Doyour Duty unflinchingly, knowing that the resources of the Empire andof our Allies are behind you, confident that, however hard the strugglenowT, our cause will triumph in the end.R.

This is of particular importance withregard to any movement of troops which might affect internal security.9. You will, where appropriate, maintain touch with His Majesty&apos;s repre-sentatives in Japan, China, the United States of America and Thailand, and withHis Majesty&apos;s Consuls-General in the Netherlands East Indies and Indo-China.The maintenance of touch with His Majesty&apos;s representatives and Consuls-General in these countries will rest with you exclusively and not with the Generaland Air Officers referred to in paragraph 3.10. The Ear East Combined Intelligence Bureau, in addition to keepingyou informed of current intelligence, will be charged with the duty of collectingsuch special intelligence as you may require. The Bureau will remain under thecontrol of the Admiralty.11. You will normally communicate as necessary with the Chiefs of Staff,the Air Ministry being used as a channel of communication for telegrams, and letters being addressed to the Secretary, Chiefs of Staff Committee; but you havethe right to correspond direct with an individual Chief of Staff on mattersparticularly affecting his Service.APPENDIX B.Extracts from Telegrams affecting Directive to Commander-in-Chief,Far East.Chiefs of Staff F.E. 6, of 24th April (para. 2) :-&quot; In issuing this Directive we had in mind that you would restrictyourself to general control. By this we mean higher direction and control as distinct from detailed operational control, which should continue to bethe function of the Army and Air Force Commands.&quot;
Telegram 82679, dated 7th August, from Troopers : &quot; After discussion with General Dewing, understand that it isproposed that G.H.Q., F.E., should exercise operational command in Malayaitself, as well as between&quot;the various areas of the Far East Command. Thisis a new proposal, which appears to be out of accord with your Directive, bywhich operational control is intended to be effected through H.Q. concernedin all Commands.&quot;To this letter, I replied in telegram 204/4 of the 8th August that I had no intention of exercising operational command in Malaya itself.APPENDIX C.Instructions Issued to General Officers Commanding andAir Officer Commanding, Far East.Headquarters of Commander-in-Chief, Far East, will open at Singapore at0800 hours on the 18th November.(2) A prime function of staff of Commander-in-Chief, Far East, will be toprepare, in conjunction with Staff of Commander-in-Chief, China, all jointplans that may be required either by Chiefs of Staff organisation in London orby strategic situation in Far East. The Authority for such plans will be eitherChiefs of Staffs in London or two Commanders-in-Chief.(3) There will be no alteration in channels by which you correspond WarOffice, Air Ministry, Colonial Office or Burma Office on any matters other thanquestions of policy affecting strategy or operations. On these questions ofpolicy you will correspond direct with this Headquarters, sending copies of yourcommunications to appropriate Governor. Similarly, all communications fromCommander-in-Chief, Far East, to you on these questions will be repeated &apos;to appropriate Governor.On other questions you will repeat to Commander-in-Chief, Far East, such your communications to War Office, &amp;c, as you judge of sufficient importance.(4) You will ensure that intimate touch now existing between yourself andGovernor in your command is maintained.(5) You will submit to Commander-in-Chief copies of your most recentappreciations and plans which -are now in operation and will keep him fully informed of any changes in situation by signal if of immediate importance,otherwise by periodical liaison letter.(6) You will submit location statement showing present location of all forceswithin your command. You will subsequently report major changes in locationas they occur.(7) The Commander-in-Chief requires to be kept informed of generaladministrative conditions of forces under your command, including position inrespect of reserves of essential commodities. Any major administrative difficulties which you may now be experiencing, or which arise subsequently, willbe. reported at once, in order that both extent to which they may affect operations or policy may be accurately gauged, and that representations may be made directby him to higher authority, if such a course appears to be required.(8) You will submit short report of present state of training of units underyour command and your programme of training for coming months. further instructions will be issued on method by which Commander-in-Chief is to bekept informed of progress of training.(9) Chiefs of Staff have made Commander-in-Chief, Far East, responsiblefor maintaining touch with His Majesty&apos;s representatives in Japan, China andThailand, and with His Majesty&apos;s Consuls-General in Netherlands East indies and Indo-China.

Telegram No. .21671, dated August 2, 1941, to Troopers, London, fromGeneral, Singapore.Continuation my 20451 of the 30th June. Reference para. 1 of your 69650of 31st May.1. Strength of Army required for defence of Malaya must be assessed inconjunction with strength of Royal Air Force.2. Final Army strength recommended in tactical appreciation assumedRoyal Air Force strength of 566 I.E. aircraft and reference is invited to para. 47(c) (3) of appreciation,3. Estimated Royal Air Force strength, including Burma, in December 1941is 186 I.E. aircraft, of which 76 will be fighters.4. Assuming that reinforcements now notified are received on earliest datesmentioned, Army strength end December 1941, excluding volunteers and secondBattalion Malay Regiment now forming, will be one Indian Division Reconnais-sance Regiment, 31 battalions and one Machine-Gun Battalion, four or five I.S.F.Battalions, one Mountain Artillery Regiment, five Field Artillery Regiments, ofwhich one will have no guns until receipt of 25-pounders, and two will be deficientof one battery each, one Anti-Tank Regiment, of varied armament, including onlyeighteen 2-pounder guns, one Anti-Tank Regiment notified your Cable 79545 ofthe 22nd July, nine Field Companies, two Army Troop Companies.5. Having now carried out personal reconnaissance of all areas I feel thatthis force will be inadequate in view of (a) anticipated Royal Air Force strength;(b) increase in aerodromes and other Royal Air Force establishments requiringprotection far beyond scale envisaged when appreciation was written; (c) develop-ment of tactics of air-borne attack and their adoption by Japanese; (d) develop-ments in Indo-China which will place Japanese in much more favourable positionto deliver surprise attack on Malaya.6. Over and above Volunteers and troops required for defence of aerodromes and vulnerable points I consider that minirmtm essential army forces are : A. In area Perlis and Kedah one Division comprising three infantry brigades, one Field Artillery Regiment, one Mountain ArtilleryRegiment, three Field Companies, one Indian Division ReconnaissanceUnit, one Light A.A. Regiment.B. Penang Fortress two Battalions.C. For Kelantan, Trengganu and Pahang, one Division comprising threeInfantry Brigades, two Field Artillery Regiments, one MountainArtillery Regiment, three Field Companies, one Indian DivisionReconnaissance Unit, one Light A.A.

The lessons of Norway, Crete and the Battle of Britain have doubtlessbeen absorbed by the Japanese who must appreciate the significance of land basedair support in combined operations. Their . probable plan for capture of singapore is to establish landing grounds progressively nearer before attemptingan actual assault on the fortress. In French Indo-China they now possess air bases just within operating distance of Northern Malaya, while Southern Malayais at present only liable to raids and diversionary attacks. An important factoris their possession of efficient long-range fighters which our information indicatescould operate from French Indo-China over southern Thailand, though not overbulk of Malaya. Their probable first step is, therefore, an.attack on southernThailand from where most of Malaya and all shipping in North Malacca Straitwould become liable to air attack. Progressive steps wOuld then aim at capture of landing grounds in Kedah and Kelantan and finally Johore. Our aerodromesclose to East coast provide tempting objectives for seaborne expeditions coveredby land-based air forces during the final approach and subsequent operations.2. To implement this strategic plan without a high degree of security of sea communications would be hazardous. But, unfortunately, it is in our ability to attack shipping that we are so weak. Greatly as we should like to turn the tables on the enemy and give them a Namsos &quot; the RA.F. has not (repeat not)at present the strength to do so. The Naval situation is well known and theabsence of a fleet was the reason for Chiefs of Staffs decision to rely primarilyupon air forces. The air situation has been fully set out by me, particularly incables 389/3 of the 30th June to Troopers, and 305/4 of the 14th August to AirMinistry. The Wirraway and Vildebeeste squadrons are likely to suffer heavy casualties. We have no reserve aircrews and few reserve aircraft except Buffalos.This means bluntly that at present not only is our ability to attack shippingdeplorably weak, but we have not the staying power to sustain even what we could now do. As our air effort dwindles (as it would if war came now) so will enemy&apos;s
Telegram No. 21671, dated August 2, 1941, to Troopers, London, fromGeneral, Singapore.Continuation my 20451 of the 30th June. Reference para. 1 of your 69650of 31st May. s1. Strength of Army required for defence of Malaya must be assessed inconjunction with strength of Royal Air Force.2. Final Army strength recommended in tactical appreciation assumedRoyal Air Force strength of 566 I.E. aircraft and reference is invited to para. 47(c) (3) of appreciation.3. Estimated Royal Air Force strength, including Burma, in December 1941is 186 I.E. aircraft, of which 76 will be fighters.4. Assuming that reinforcements now notified are received on earliest datesmentioned, Army strength end December 1941, excluding volunteers and secondBattalion Malay Regiment now forming, will be one Indian Division Reconnais-sance Regiment, 31 battalions and one Machine-Gun Battalion, four or five I.S.F.Battalions, one Mountain Artillery Regiment, five Field Artillery Regiments, ofwThich one will have no guns until receipt of 25-pounders, and two will be deficientof one battery each, one Anti-Tank Regiment, of varied armament, including onlyeighteen 2-pounder guns, one Anti-Tank Regiment notified your Cable 79545 ofthe 22nd July, nine Field Companies, two Army Troop Companies.5. Having now carried out personal reconnaissance of all areas I feel thatthis force will be inadequate in view of (a) anticipated Royal Air Force strength;(o) increase in aerodromes and other Royal Air Force establishments requiringprotection far beyond scale envisaged when appreciation was written; (c) develop-ment of tactics of air-borne attack and their adoption by Japanese; (d) develop-ments in Indo-China which will place Japanese in much more favourable positionto deliver surprise attack on Malaya.6. Over and above Volunteers and troops required for defence of aerodromes and vulnerable points I consider that minimum essential army forces are : A. In area Perlis and Kedah one Division comprising three infantry brigades, one Field Artillery Regiment, one Mountain ArtilleryRegiment, three Field Companies, one Indian Division ReconnaissanceUnit, one Light A.A. Regiment.B. Penang Fortress two Battalions.C. For Kelantan, Trengganu and Pahang, one Division comprising threeInfantry Brigades, two Field Artillery Regiments, one MountainArtillery Regiment, three Field Companies, one Indian DivisionReconnaissance Unit, one Light A.A. Regiment.D. In reserve in Northern Malaya one complete Indian Division, includingDivisional Reconnaissance unit. Also as corps troops one A./Tk.Regiment, one Light A.A. Regiment, one Tank Regiment, one machine gun Battalion.E. For Johore one Division consisting of two Infantry Brigades, one machine gun Battalion, two Field Artillery Regiments, one A./TankRegiment, two Field Companies.F. For Singapore including reserves in Southern Malaya.   One Divisionincluding two Field Regiments, one A./Tk. Regiment, one indian division Reconnaissance unit. Also one Tank Regiment, one light a.A. Regiment.G. For Borneo one Infantry Brigade, one Field Battery, one Field Company.7. Light A.A. units for aerodromes defence will be dealt with separately.Apart from Volunteers estimated Infantry requirements for aerodrome defenceare seven complete I.S.F. Battalions.8. See my 21620 of the 1st August, 1941, for details of tank units mentionedin para. 6 and tank units required for aerodrome defence.

Would point out that on increase of our Air Forces to approved strengthany surplus Army Forces in Malaya can become general reserve for Far East.Commander-in-Chief. Far East, has not examined above requirements in detail,but has approved despatch of this cable as definition of target.Summary of appreciation on which these requirements are based will be telegraphed shortly.Brigadier,&apos;  General Staff.August 2, 1941.A summary of this estimate is as follows : 48 Infantry Battalions.4 Indian Reconnaissance Units.9 Forward Artillery Regiments.4 Light A.A. Regiments.2 Tank Regiments.3 Anti-Tank Regiments.This was exclusive of the Volunteers, the Infantry, A.A. Units and TankUnits required for aerodrome defence, and also the A.A. Units for the defenceof localities, including the Naval Base.Comments by General Headquarters on Estimate by General OfficerCommanding, Malaya, of Forces Required.Outward Cable No. 359/4, dated Augicst 20.To Troopers from Easfar.Your 83903 of the 13th August following are my general observations.1. The lessons of Norway, Crete and the Battle of Britain have doubtlessbeen absorbed by the Japanese who must appreciate the significance of land basedair support in combined operations. Their probable plan for capture of singapore is to establish landing grounds progressively nearer before attemptingah actual assault on the fortress. In French Indo-China they now possess air bases just within operating distance of Northern Malaya, while Southern Malayais at present only liable to raids and diversionary attacks. An important factoris their possession of efficient long-range fighters which our information indicatescould operate from French Indo-China over southern Thailand, though not overbulk of Malaya. Their probable first step is, therefore, an.attack on southernThailand from where most of Malaya and all shipping in North Malacca Straitwould become liable to air attack. Progressive steps would then aim at capture of landing grounds in Kedah and Kelantan and finally Johore. Our aerodromesclose to East coast provide tempting objectives for seaborne expeditions coveredby land-based air forces during the final approach and subsequent operations.2. To implement this strategic plan without a high degree of security of sea communications would be hazardous. But, unfortunately, it is in our ability to attack&apos;shipping that we are so weak. Greatly as we should like to turn the tables on the enemy and give them a &quot; Namsos &quot; the R.A.F. has not (repeat not)at present the strength to do so. The Naval situation is well known and theabsence of a fleet was the reason for Chiefs of Staffs decision to rely primarilyupon air forces. The air situation has been fully set out by me, particularly incables 389/3 of the 30th June to Troopers, and 305/4 of the 14th August to AirMinistry. The Wirraway and Vildebeeste squadrons are likely to suffer heavy casualties. We have no reserve aircrews and few reserve aircraft except Buffalos.This means bluntly that at present not only is our ability to attack shippingdeplorably weak, but we have not the staying power to sustain even what we could now do. As our air effort dwindles (as it would if war came now) so will enemy&apos;s
chances of landing increase. Long stretches of beach cannot be strongly defendedeverywhere, and fighting inland is, therefore, certain to occur. In these conditionsour troops might expect to receive a little support from the air. Mere multiplica-tion of bodies is not an efficient substitute for weakness in the air, but in such circumstances it is clearly advisable to be amply strong on the ground.3. British Malaya excluding all mountainous jungle has a much larger&quot;area than for example Eire. From north to south is further than fromEdinburgh to London. Owing to lack of communications the country does notlend itself to a system of defence based on the rapid movement of centralreserves. This same restriction would be an even greater handicap to anenemy trying to overrun the country but would not apply if he merely intendedto gain control of certain aerodrome areas in the north and east. This he islikely to try to do very rapidly and therefore the defending troops in these areastogether with their local reserves must be strong. The quicker the attacker&apos;splan can be upset the better since the Japanese are notoriously bad at copingwith a situation in which everything has not gone according to plan. For these reasons I share the General Officer Commanding&apos;s wish to strengthen the east coast garrisons and to make Matador strong.4.   Referring now to his 21776 in detail :His first paragraph has been elaborated above.Second.&apos; As explained I agree that Kelantan and Kuantan requirestrengthening.Third (a) Agreed.(&amp;) To implement Matador General Officer Commanding estimatesone brigade group required in addition to this division. For the present I accept this.   See also Easfars 228/4 of the 7th August.Fourth; Agreed as to desirability that troops should be Regulars. Penangmay become a very important port though the air threat to it would be diminished by a successful Matador.Fifth. See paragraph 5.Sixth. Agreed. I would observe that an Australian Imperial Forces brigadelacks some flexibility if earmarked as a Command reserve. In emergency itcan of course be used anywhere not necessarily under its own divisionalcommander. But precautionary moves such as to. a central or more northerlyposition and placing it under a British Divisional Commander might always have political implications.Seventh. Agreed. &apos;Eighth. Kuching must be defended to prevent Japanese establishing them-selves in Western Borneo.   I do not think that a brigade group is essential.Ninth. Volunteers are to take a share of these commitments and the RoyalAir Force are helping by providing temporarily guards for some vulnerable points.5. His fifth. The brigade group referred to in third above would Iunderstand if Matador is implemented be moved right up to the Haadyai area.Thereafter it could not be counted on for internal security in Perak, Kedahor Penang or in fact for anything other than Matador. General OfficersCommanding view is that Matador force may be attacked down Kra Isthmusby one division and from the south-east by two more. He foresees possibilityof protracted land operations in Singora area with inadequate air supportbut with considerable air opposition. He therefore feels the need of somesource from which to draw fresh troops. Without this he feels that thesenorthern operations may cause a severe drain on his resources further southand is anxious lest the Johore and fortress areas should become so depleted asto be endangered by a direct assault. Allowing for commitments at Penangand*Khoh road there would be in effect one brigade in reserve for the northernarea. General Officer Commanding would be uneasy with no such reserveespecially in view of possibility of unrest in the plantation and mining areas(of which we had an example last May).6. We must not neglect possible action by Dutch and Americans. Inmy 305/4 paragraph 4, I included 39 Dutch bombers, this being their agreedcontribution if the Japanese attack falls on Malaya.   I am confident of their
honest intentions to co-operate fully, but the Japanese may well make a diversion towards some part of Netherlands East Indies to delay implementation of out&apos; plans for co-operation,7. The likelihood of co-operation by the United States of America is obviously in somewhat greater doubt though last sentence in paragraph 16of your 84523 is encouraging. It might be some time before they joined inunless the Philippines were attacked. The view expressed above aboutJapanese diversionary action against Netherlands East Indies does not apply equally to the Philippines, since the one certain way of bringing the UnitedStates of America into the war is by attacking American territory. TheJapanese might hope the United States of America would hesitate long enoughto allow of some substantial success against us, but it is very unlikely that theUnited States of America would continue to stand aside while a protractedbattle is fought anywhere on the Malaya peninsula The Philippines mustbe a source of great anxiety to the Japanese. To attack them would be a formidable undertaking and could hardly be taken on simultaneously with a sustained effort in Malaya or Netherlands East Indies. It is thereforeprobable that American air forces from Luzon possibly reinforced from Hawaiiwould be able to join in any major battle taking place in Malaya or NetherlandsRast Indies. Submarines from Manila could operate against sea communications and the United States Pacific fleet, always a cause of anxiety, would become a very real threat.Conclusion.8. My broad conclusion is that if Malaya is attacked violent initialstruggles for the aerodrome areas are highly probable but a protracted land battle during which wre should be thrown upon our own unaided resources ismuch less likely.9. General Officer&apos;s Commanding estimate of Army forces was based onthe anticipated strength of Royal Air Force in December 1941. As a targetin those conditions I have little to criticise although my own estimate wouldbe slightly less. No drastic decrease, however, is acceptable in the target figuresuntil the Royal Air Force is materially increased not only in numbers but in quality of aircraft and in reserves of air crews and aeroplanes. Further I must consider the rest of my command and before this target was actually achievedI should probably want to increase the troops in Burma by a brigade.10. When trying to balance an increase of air forces against a savingm troops the question of types is important as it is the power to strike atshipping that matters most here. Without knowledge of the programme of royal Air Force reinforcements for early 1942 I cannot judge whether suitabletypes will have arrived in time to make a reduction in the Army target possible.Nor do I know whether troops or aircraft will be the easier to provide, but Ihave no doubt what our first requirement here is. We want to increase ourhitting power against ships and our capacity to go on hitting. In this way we shall make it difficult for the enemy to land and equally difficult for himto nourish any initial successes.(Signed) I. S. 0.

From Bangkok to Foreign Office.Sir J. Crosby to Mr. Eden. (Received December 7.)(No. 893.) Bangkok, December 7, 1941.(Foreign Office please repeat to Washington, Tokyo and to [sic] if thoughturgently necessary.)Your telegrams Nos. 574 and 575 have crossed my telegram No. 892.I have just seen the Minister for Foreign Affairs and we send you thefollowing message from us both. For God&apos;s sake do not allow British forces to occupy one inch of Thai (Siamese) territory unless and until Japan has struckthe first blow at Thailand (Siam). At present practically every Thai (Siamese)is behind Britain in opposition to Japan, but it will be otherwise and irreparableharm will be done, if Britain is the first to violate Thai (Siamese) neutrality.2. The Thai Prime Minister has positive information that a Japaneseattack on Thailand was planned for the 3rd December. It was postponed at thelast moment, but it is to take place in the immediate future.3. The Minister for Foreign Affairs tells me Colonel Moriya, who was theJapanese military attache here some years ago. has suddenly appeared in Bangkokand procured an interview yesterday with Luang Praclist. now Minister ofFinance but formerly Minister for Foreign Affairs. Moriya enquired what wasthe attitude of Thailand towards Japan and said that the situation was veryserious. Luang Pradist replied that he was no longer Foreign Minister and wasnot competent to answer this question.4. In view of urgent critical situation I beg to you to telegraph to me,most immediately, authority to approach the Prime Minister with a proposalfor the joint defence of southern Thailand in the event of a Japanese attack,as suggested in the second paragraph of my telegram No. 820. But I think theThais would transfer the seat of government to the north for strategic considerations, though they would send a portion of their troops south.(Repeated to Washington under Foreign Office No. 6772 and to Tokyo underForeign Office No. 1629.)APPENDIX S.Summary of Talk by Commander-in-Chief, Far East, December 22, 1941, inthe Council Chamber, Colonial Secretariat, Singapore, as issued tothe Press and Leaders of different Communities.LET us admit that retirement might never have become necessary had wehad larger forces out here and especially more military equipment of all sorts;the latter, as you know, has been the limiting factor all through, there has never been, even now, enough to meet the demands from all over the world. You allknow that a lot of aeroplanes and other equipment has gone to Russia; withoutthat equipment we do not know what the result of the battle in Russia might havebeen. It must have been a very near thing whether the Germans got to Moscowor not, and the equipment Britain sent there may just have turned the scale.Then take Libya. A great amount of equipment has gone there, some of whichmight have come to Malaya, but if that had not been done would the Libyanbattle have been the success that it is now ? As you know, things went very slowlyat first and there was very hard fighting; there again there wasn&apos;t&apos;t much to spare.So those responsible for allotment of troops and equipment judged accurately theminimum necessary for success in these places; there was no lavishness or waste.Surely, then, we can retain our confidence in them to make such readjustments as are necessary to meet our problems.We must take a very broad view of this war both in time and in space. Itis a world war and we must have a world-wide view.   There was no knowing
when the war horse would break out, and the authorities in England would nothave been justified in sending equipment here when we were still at peace whenit was urgently needed in areas where fighting was already taking place, and where major operations were definitely going on. It is always a very difficult decision to make when one hasn&apos;t got enough to go round; someone has to goshort and as we were not then engaged in the actual fighting we have not got all we wanted. We may have suffered from that, but let us take again the broadview.  We have co-operated in the battle of Libya and in the fighting in Russia.So much for space. Now about time. About eighteen months ago I wastalking to General Smuts on a certain matter and ^remarked that three years wasa very long period to wait, and he replied to this^ effect: &quot; What is three, sevenor even ten years in the life of an Empire ? You must take a broad view of these things.&quot; So must we. We may have lost a large part of Northern Malaya, butfor a time only.So there must be no feeling of despondency-because of these temporary set-backs. It must spur us on to greater efforts, to hold on, or to help others to holdon, as far North as possible, sure in the knowledge that every effort is being madeelsewhere to provide us with the help that we now stand in need.One of the brighter sides of the last two weeks has been the admirableco-operation between the Allies. The United States have had problems of theirown to deal with but they have helped. China, as you know, is making valiantattacks on the rear of the Japanese forces attacking Hong Kong. The Nether-lands East Indies have, as we knew they would, co-operated absolutely whole-heartedly, realising that the whole defence problem of this area is one; I neednot remind you of the exploits of their submarines.But in war of to-day co-operation is not merely on the military plane, aquestion of tanks or aeroplanes or ships, it is much wider and includesco-operation of all the civil authorities and of the whole of the civil community.I am speaking to you now who have the privilege of leadership in this struggle.I use that term &quot; privilege&quot; advisedly because this struggle is of such vitalimportance to the future of the whole world that it is a privilege for anyone totake part in it, especially as a leader. I would like to mention a few points where this leadership can be given. First, calmness. - At the start of a war events arestrange and are vivid and alarming. The noise of bombs or anti-aircraft gunsoften terrifies people at first until they realise it is not the noise that damages:and A.A. guns are friends. In connection with this there is a tendency for labour to disappear, perhaps for the whole day, during an air attack. some local dispersal may be necessary, but set an example of remaining at your workfor as long as possible and resuming it as soon as the raid is over. Then, there&apos;sa vast amount of loose talk or rumours going about, fantastic rumours veryoften.   Stop this at once, as well as any defeatist talk and uninformed criticism.Co-operation is not only material; it is moral and it is an enormous help to the military leaders to know that behind them they have the solid moral supportof the population. There are many little ways in which this moral support canbe and is being made evident; hostels, canteens on railway stations, giving liftsin cars to anyone in uniform, little acts of kindness to families who, for military reasons, have had to be moved.But, above all, remember the importance of secrecy. There has been a lotsaid on this subject but we are not nearly good enough yet; here the enemy havethe advantage of us because the Japanese are capable of preserving secrets. TheNaval move resulting in the attack on Hawaii was only possible because of theextreme secrecy with which it was prepared and executed, and I&apos;ve wonderedsince whether it would have been so secret had it started from Singapore. so if you do happen to hear or guess of any movements by land, air or sea, keep theinformation entirely to yourself, don&apos;t breathe it to anybody and stop otherstalking. And, whilst on that subject, I must say a word about censorship. I fully sympathise with the desire of the public for news, and the keenness of the newspapers and their correspondents to give it to them. But there is one rigidrule which must be enforced, namely, that the censors cannot allow anything tobe published that would give information to the enemy. Admittedly, this is sometimes a matter for individual judgment, and sometimes opinions will differ,but think of the example of Hawaii and how the whole success of an operationmay be prejudiced by some sentence, apparently quite harmless, that just fits intothe jig-saw puzzle that the enemy intelligence are trying to piece together.
One last point; the Japanese claim they are fighting for the Asiatics againstthe Whites. If so, then why are they allied with Germany and Italy and whyare they fighting China? Do.n&apos;t let others be deceived by this. Look at theJapanese record in Korea, China and Formosa. It is clear that their object, isto dominate, and not to liberate, Asiatics on the mainland. They are taking their example now from Hitler, and think of his record of dishonour, treacheryand brutal despotism. We must keep before us ever what is the real issue at stake. It is not merely to ensure that certain areas of land remain under theUnion Jack; it is to preserve what the flag stands for, to ensure that a decentstandard shall be maintained for the future life of the world, a standard basedon truth, justice and freedom. This is of paramount importance not so muchperhaps for ourselves as for our children and their descendants. To ensure thisno effort and no sacrifice can be too great.Do you remember what The King said on Empire Day, 1940 ?&quot; Keep your hearts proud and your resolve unshaken. Put into your task,whatever it may be, all the courage and purpose of which you are capable. let us go forward to that task as one man, a smile on our lips and our heads heldhigh, and, with God&apos;s help, we shall not fail.&quot;General Headquarters,Far East, Singapore,December 22, 1941.APPENDIX T.Comrnander-in-Chief, Far East, to Commander-in-Chief, India, General OfficerCommanding, Burma, Chief General Staff, Australia, General OfficerCommanding New Zealand Military Forces.(122/7.   23/12.)My 76/7, 18th December.Following is summary of General Officer Commanding&apos;s notes on Japanesetactics and (? methods in) dealing with them following personal visit to forward area. Type of country, plantation rubber, interspersed by Padi, with mangroveswamps near the coast. Area generally wet, intersected by numerous streams,observation very restricted.   Japanese tactics.1. Japanese Force in North Malaya highly trained army of gangsters,equipped with high proportion tommy guns and mortars. Light tanks whichoccasionally give support are type of armoured carrier vulnerable to our anti-tankrifles and heavier weapons. Force has little artillery. Japanese full of lowcunning, and use artificial noises, such as mortars with loud explosion, Chinesecrackers and bullets, which make loud noise on impact, to lower morale and causepremature withdrawals.2.   Enemy tactics in attack.(a) Send forward screen of men to locate.our position and employ abovemethods. These often dressed ordinary shorts and running-shoes andmix with civilians, where possible.(b) As soon as screen has located our position, strong forces, often of a battalion, deploy in rear and pass round flanks of position. All abovedone very rapidly and every endeavour made to maintain momentumof attack.3. Japanese can move rapidly through jungle swamps and across rivers,for which sometimes equipped with rubber belts. Prepared to live on country to greater extent than our troops, and therefore less dependent on lines of com-munication. Minor tactics poor and attacks often made in close formation overopen country.
4. Counter to Japanese tactics. First essential rigid discipline and absolutesteadiness. Position must not he disclosed by opening fire unless target is a goodone.5. Second, outflanking and infiltration tactics must not lead to withdrawals,which should take place only on order of higher authority.6. Experience has proved that way to defeat enemy is to counter-attack.Counter-attack must be immediate, planned beforehand wherever possible, and owing to necessity for speed usually by small bodies of company or less oninitiative of local commander.7.   Suggested method of defence is (a) Holding group dug in astride main communications.(b) Striking force forward on flanks ready to attack as soon as enemy makescontact with holding group. Defence must be in depth to deal withoutflanking forces, and usually only holding group should be dug in.Essentially war of movement and attack and too much digging createsdefence complex. Armoured cars of value for attacking down roads,particularly type that can be driven freely in either direction.8. Morale. Spreading of rumours and exaggerated reports of efficiencymust be rigidly suppressed.9. Sore Feet. Prolonged operations in waterlogged&apos; country have causedsore feet and loss ching efficiency.    Constant  attention  by JuniorCommanders essential.10. Summary. In this type of warfare efficiency, alertness and cunning ofthe individual count. Troops must expect to be shot at from unexpected direc-tions, and everyone must be prepared to hit back. Cannot defeat enemy bysitting in prepared positions and letting him walk round us. Must play him athis own game and attack him on every possible occasion.(Repeated War Office.)APPENDIX U.Names of Officers deserving of Special Mention during the period of myCommand.Commands *Lieutenant-General Sir D.
