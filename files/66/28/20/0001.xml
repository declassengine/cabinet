THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT        ft *Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1942. - - - -SECRET. Copy No.   2W.P. (42) 390.September 3, 1942.      &apos; IWAR CABINET.ALLOCATION OF AIR TRANSPORT FACILITIES.Memorandum by the.Lord President of the Council.ON the 16th February last I was invited to examine, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, the present system of allocating air transport facilities and todetermine what alterations in that system were called for (W.M. (42) 21stConclusions, Minute 7). I have now completed my investigations into thisquestion.2. For the present purpose, the principal &quot; regular &quot; air transport services can conveniently be divided into the following categories : (a) Services originating in the United Kingdom and operating to, or through,theatres of war;(b) Other Services originating in the United Kingdom.(c) Services not originating in the United Kingdom.Services to theatres of war.3. Applications from Civil Departments for seats on these services are atpresent made to the Civil Aviation Department of the Air Ministry, andapplications from the Service Departments to Movements 5 in the Air Ministry.Priorities are settled, by a Priorities Board composed as follows : An Air Commodore (in the chair).A General representing the War Office.A Captain representing the Admiralty.An Official of the Civil Aviation Department representing all civil departments.A Royal Air Force Officer (Secretary).I consider that this Priorities Board should be reconstituted as follows : Chairman:  the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of  State  for Air(Captain Balfour).One representative of each of the Fighting Services.A representative of the Foreign Office.A Treasury Official representing all other Civil Departments.Joint Secretaries : a Royal Air Force Officer and a Member of the CivilAviation Department.Applications for passages sponsored by Civil Departments should continueto be made to the Civil Aviation Department; but that Department should assesstheir priority in consultation with the Foreign Office and Treasury representatives on the Board. The civil applications will then be co-ordinated with the militaryapplications by the Priorities Board.Other Services originating in the United Kingdom.4. I consider that applications for passages should be made and considered in the same way as applications for passages on services to theatres of war,priorities being co-ordinated by a Priorities Board constituted as follows : Chairman:   the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of  State  for Air(Captain Balfour).Two representatives of the three Fighting Services.[24289]
A representative of the Foreign Office.One representative of the Supply Departments.An Official of the Treasury representing all other Civil Departments.Secretary: A Member of the Civil Aviation Department.Services not originating in the United Kingdom.5. Arrangements for the allocation of seats on such services vary accordingto the local circumstances in each case. It is clear that, for physical reasons,priorities on these services cannot be settled by a Priorities Board sitting inLondon, and that the machinery for dealing with them must be worked out onthe spot. The Priorities Board will, however, make it their business to see thatGovernment Departments are kept informed of the arrangements made in eachcase and, in the event of Departments not being satisfied with those arrangements,to consider whether they are susceptible of improvement..Comment.6. There&apos;will thus in effect be one Board sitting in two Panels. On the panel dealing with the services to theatres of war, the Services will have pre-dominant representation, whilst the Civil Departments will be in the majority on the Panel dealing with other services.7. I trust that this procedure will work smoothly and without friction.It would, however, perhaps be a wise precaution for some one Member of the WarCabinet to be invited to undertake the responsibility of dealing, on behalf of theWar Cabinet, with any disagreement that may arise in a matter of principle between.the Secretary of State for Air and any other Minister affected by adecision of the Board.J. A.Great George Street, S. W. 1,. * September 3, 1942.
