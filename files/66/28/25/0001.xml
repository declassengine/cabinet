THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  September 1942.SECRET.W.P. (42) 395.September 7, 1942WAR CABINET.THE INDIAN REPRESENTATIVES AT THE WAR CABINET.Note by the Prime Minister.We may expect the arrival, during this week, of His Highness the MaharajaJam Sahib of Nawanagar and the Honourable Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar,representatives of India at the War Cabinet. The invitation was a generousgesture to loyal Indians, and we should make the most of it. They must be treated in every possible way as Dominion representatives, and I know my colleagues will show them every courtesy and consideration.But let me sound one note of warning. Though I shall naturally invite themto attend our Monday Meetings on general war affairs, it must not be assumed that I shall feel able to invite them to Meetings when Indian affairs are to bediscussed. We have already had several such meetings, and may have more, atwhich the presence of Indian representatives would be highly embarrassing. i suggest we should bear this point in mind in any personal conversations wre mayhave with the Jam Sahib and Sir Ramaswami, and avoid giving them theimpression that they have a right to attend all War Cabinet Meetings, ornecessarily to be present when Indian matters are under discussion.It will, of course, follow that they will not receive all papers circulated toWar Cabinet Ministers. No doubt my colleagues will bear this also in mind.A Note is annexed indicating the classes of papers which they will receive.W. S. C.10, Downing Street, S.W.1,September 7, 1942.Copy No.\1[24314]
