The role of this force is to lead attacks and to mark the aiming pointby means of incendiaries, flares and other pyrotechnics to ensure that the lessskilled crews of the main force find the target.Crews chosen as Pathfinders are required to have carried out at least 12operational sorties and to have proved their determination to press home their attacks; they must be adaptable to new methods and show &quot;a high standard of professional ability; they are all volunteers.The Kassel and Nuremberg raids mentioned later were led by Pathfinders,and on both occasions the main force reported that the target was well markedfor them. These raids, however, had the benefit of moonlight; the skill of thePathfinders and the advantages of the new system will be better tested in the approaching dark period.Operational Achievements.Osnabrilck (attacked on the 9th/ 10th and 17th/18th August).Day photographs showing some of the results of the two raids on this important centre of communications and commerce have now been examined.The railway yards and workshops to the East of the City and the Kanalhafento the West, have been severely damaged. Two direct hits on the goods andshunting station have demolished buildings over a large area. This is shown-inprint No. 1.A comparison of prints Nos. 2 and 3, which are photographs of the inlandport taken before and after the attack, show that the warehouse and dockfacilities of the port have been almost completely destroyed. Apart from theserious loss of floor space and other dock facilities, a great amount of valuableraw material and foodstuffs must also have been destroyed.Between the railway centre and the inland port, the city has been extensivelydamaged by fire and blast. The Labour Bureau and Board of Trade buildinghave been gutted, the Law Courts seriously damaged and the main Post office has received a direct hit; a gas meter factory and.a shed in the railway workshopsNorth-East of the town have been gutted by fire; a building of 150 feet by 35 feetin the Artillery Barracks and a building 150 feet by 65 feet in a barracks to theNorth-East of this have both been destroyed by high&apos; explosive.
A very reliable report of the result of the first attack states : &quot;The attack lasted from 3 a.m. to 4-30 a.m. Nearly 200 H.E. andmany thousands of incendiaries were dropped. About 150 persons were killed or seriously injured. 190 houses were destroyed or badly damaged and 300 to 400 more slightly damaged. The G.P.O. and six industrial buildings were hit and the water supply interrupted. Many hundreds were rendered homeless.&quot;Flensburg (18th/19th August).118 aircraft were sent to attack the town and the submarine building yards.Weather was expected to be reasonably good with breaks in the cloud through which the targets could be recognised. In the event, however, ground haze wasvery thick indeed and made identification of ground detail virtually impossible.It is not thought that any concentration of attack can have been effected.Dieppe (19th August).Boston aircraft of Bomber Command took part in the combined operations at Dieppe.-24 aircraft laid a smoke-screen to blind the enemy gun positions commanding the town and the harbour and to obscure the harbour itself. These were followedby two raids of 28 aircraft each on gun positions and other military objectives inthe Dieppe defence system. Smoke and evasive action made detailed observationof results difficult.Frankfurt (24th/25th August).231 aircraft led by 37 aircraft of the Pathfinder Force were sent to attackFrankfurt. Most aircraft found almost complete cloud cover over the target andhad to bomb blind. A few aircraft, however, were able to pin-point the targetthrough fleeting gaps in the cloud.  Some good fires were seen in the built-up area.Photographs taken on the 26th August give incomplete cover of the town.An area of approximately four acres has been devastated by fire, and a numberof warehouses, two of which measure 170 yards by 20 yards and 100 yards by25 yards respectively, have been completely gutted. Another large building, onewing of which was still smouldering 36 hours after the attack, has also been severely damaged. Smaller buildings have also been gutted. A photograph isattached showing the devastated area.Kassel (27th/28th August).306 aircraft, led by 33 Pathfinders, attacked Kassel in somewhat cloudy andhazy conditions. Crews&apos; reports are very promising and the plot of night photo-graphs indicates that there was a considerable concentration in the South-west of the City. A night photograph attached shows large bombs bursting in thecentre of the City.  Day photographs have not yet been obtained.Nuremberg (28th/29th August).30 Pathfinders leading a force of 159 other aircraft attacked.in good weather conditions. Crews are unanimous in proclaiming the success of the raid and somesay that the fires were reminiscent of Cologne. The success is confirmed by nightphotographs (examples attached) which show fires beginning to take hold and large volumes of smoke drifting over the City.Day photographs have not yet been obtained.Saarbrucken (28th/29th August).It will be recalled that the railway centre, industries and business quarters in Saarbrucken were severely damaged in the raid on 29th/30th July. While theheavy bombers were attacking Nuremberg on 28th/29th August, 111 medium bombers, which had insufficient range to reach Nuremberg, delivered a second attack on the town. Night photographs show bomb bursts in the city and oneparticularly large mushroom of smoke, but no daylight photographs have yetbeen obtained.Information about Previous Raids.Mainz.The damage inflicted in Mainz was fully reported in the last digest. A&quot; black-out&quot; photograph is attached showing the areas of complete devastation.Reports in the German press confirm that the damage caused in the townwas on a great scale. One paper writes that Mainz is to be completely rebuilt.A reliable estimate is that about 10,000 people lost their homes and were evacuated.[24311] b 2
Duisburg.It is reported that during the attack of 21st/22nd July a large part of theimportant Thyssen metal-rolling mills was destroyed, and it is believed thatrepairs will take at least six months.Another source reports that on the same night considerable damage was caused to the Niederrheinische Steel Works. The casting and smelting sheds are said to have been almost totally destroyed, and two furnaces put out of action.Hits were also made on a large boiler house, the main transformer building andthe welding shed.The Ruhr.Photographs of the Ruhr area taken on the 18th and 19th August revealmany areas of damage not previously reported. At Mors, many industrial buildings have been demolished and sticks of bombs have fallen across streets of workmen&apos;s dwellings and amongst public buildings. At Krefeld four factorieshave been damaged or partially destroyed. At Viersen much damage has beenclone to factories and the railway system.Mining.A report from a reliable source states that, during the months of June and july, no less than 14 ships engaged in one class of traffic, that of carrying coal,were sunk by mines during journeys from Rotterdam to the Baltic. It was statedthat the train ferry from Denmark to Sweden is still always preceded by twomine sweepers.The following additional reports have been received : (i) A Norwegian ship of 5,800 tons was mined in the Baltic on the24th August and was then slowly sinking.(ii) The Swedish motor vessel Diana was damaged by a mine at the mouth of&apos;the Elbe on the 5th August,- but managed to reach Hamburg.(iii) The Swedish press announces that the Sigyn, of 4,528 tons, was mined and sank early in August.(iv) The Swedish tanker Pollux, of 8,741 tons, has been severely damaged by a mine in the Baltic. It is believed this took place in the Sassnitz-Trelleborg area.Daylight Raids.The value of daylight raids on towns in Western Germany by single aircraftmay be seen from the following extract from the Hamburger Fremdenblatt ofthe 2nd August : &quot; Recent experience has shown that surprise daylight raidsmay cause considerable loss of life. Therefore, during daylight air-raid warnings,too, everyone must immediately go to the nearest shelter even if there is no anti-aircraft fire to be heard. The police have instructions to take proceedings against any persons not taking shelter.&quot;General.Many reports indicate the varied effects of the bombing this summer. InBremen, for example, many of the workers from the Focke Wulf factory whosehomes were demolished have had to be housed in emergency barracks which aretotally unsuited to winter conditions. The shortage of shoes and clothing inGermany is demonstrated by the results of the Hamburg raid. The purchase ofall articles covered by the German clothes rationing card was prohibitedimmediately after the attack in order to make it possible to supply the homelessfirst of all. The population is said to have accepted the position philosophicallynotwithstanding that their prospect of one pair of shoes for the coming year would thereby become more remote. In Duisburg it is reported that the raids in Julycompletely upset coal traffic from Germany to Italy for a week.Study of the German press and radio shows the evident anxiety of theGerman authorities to &quot; boost &quot; morale on the home front. There are constantreferences to the difference between the state of the home front now and in 1918,coupled with loud and persistent protestations that the morale of the home frontcan never be shaken by air raids. Much space is devoted to A.R.P. propaganda.The tone of the German press is an indication of the moral effect of the raidsand of the anxiety felt for the future.A. H. M.
