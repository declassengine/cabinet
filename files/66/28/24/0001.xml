(42) 113th Conclusions, Minute 8, regarding theaction to be taken in the event of Mr. Gandhi starting a fast unto death, Icirculate copies of my telegram to the Viceroy of the 19th August and his replydated the 29th August. I also append copies of the Defence of India Rules towhich he refers.The Viceroy&apos;s new scheme (set out in paragraphs of his telegram of the29th August) is, of course, a departure from the policy which he has hitherto contemplated, but, as it appears to be designed to carry his Council with himalong a line approximating to that recommended from here, we must clearly give it careful consideration. Its merits seem to turn largely on the extent to whichDevadas Gandhi may be willing to take up the role assigned to him, and on theextent to which it will be possible for him or for the authorities to ensureenforcement of such undertakings as he feels able to give.L. S. A.India Office, September 3, 1942.Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated August 19, 1942.(Immediate.)14649. Personal. Your personal telegram 16th August, 2443-S. WarCabinet are most grateful for full explanation of your views, but are compelledto revert to subject since they feel considerable anxiety about consequences ofpolicy envisaged. In their view it is most important to avoid situation in whichGandhi or his followers could interpret his release from detention as victory inhis struggle against Government of India, or which others might regard as a sign of weakness on the Government of India&apos;s part. They urge that you should give further consideration to the possibility of modifying conditions of detentionon the lines of &quot; home domicile,&quot; viz., detention in suitable house (together withsuch friends as he wished, who would also be interned) under close guard inorder to restrict detenu&apos;s movement and communication with, or visits by, persons from outside, but on the clear understanding, which should be made public atappropriate moment, that Government assume^ responsibility for his or otherdetained persons&apos; health or welfare or diet beyond provision of food desired and suitable living conditions. Gandhi could have his own medical advisers, and anyattendance by a medical officer in the service of the Government of India would only be at his own request. Responsibility for the consequences, if he chose tofast, would then rest with himself, his friends and his own medical advisers, and government of India would be relieved of responsibility.,[24304]
2. I should be grateful for your reactions to this suggestion, which explainsin rather more detail general idea contained in my telegram of 11th August,14074. Main purpose of Governments suggestion is, of course, to maintainmaximum practicable seclusion from the outside world for so long as any dangerremains of his still trying to carry on his revolutionary campaign. If thesuggestion were adopted there might be advantages in settling place of detentionif it is not to be his present quarters, and installing him there at once before any fast begins. It would, of course, have to be a place over which restrictionscould be effectively maintained. I note that the layout at Sevagram is such asto make the application of the suggested arrangements very difficult, though I am not sure that, if Gandhi expressed a strong desire to go to Sevagram in orderto carry out a fast, it would not be justifiable, after pointing out to him theconsequences of his choice to the innocent members of the community, to picketthe whole place if he persisted in that choice.3. Have you any idea yet of his intention to fast and, if so, on what allegedmotive ?. Much depends on that.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated August 29, 1942.(Immediate.)2648-S. Personal. Your personal telegram 14649 of 19th August. Beforecommenting further I would premise that there is no sign yet of a fast,though Gandhi has by now had my reply rejecting requests in his letter of14th August. Moreover, he has by now seen the newspapers, and if he had intended to fast as a demonstration against Congress violence that has beendisplayed by so many quarters or by way of embarrassing Government in puttingdown the situation which he must have seen is coming very swiftly under control,one might have expected him to do so. Prior to his arrest he is alleged in Harijanto have&apos;said to Birla that he did not intend to fast unless and until impulse came.2. &quot; I now turn to Cabinefs specific proposals. If by &quot; home domicile &quot; youmean restriction of residence under Defence Rule 26 (1) (d), combined withrestrictions on communication with other persons under Rule 26 (1) (/), insteadof (as at present) detention under Rule 26 (&amp;), it would, I am advised, be legallypossible to secure desired objects in this way. But in practice there would beno difference between restriction of residence and full detention since Gandhiwould not, in our judgment, voluntarily comply with any restriction orderimposed on him, and it would therefore be necessary wherever he was kept toenforce orders by force or display of force under Rule 132. In these circum-stances Gandhi would in either case be physically a prisoner, and the public would see no difference in the two methods of treatment. It is true that use ofRule 26 (1) (d) and (/) would make it easier to prescribe the Sevagram Ashramas his domicile because it would not be necessary to take physical possession of premises. Access of public to precincts to Ashram could, it appears, legally be regulated under Defence of India Rule 9 (1) (c). But this course would involveeither eviction or corresponding restriction of innocent inmates of Ashram,including women and children, and either action would be exploited against us.Moreover, the Ashram, which is a straggling collection of buildings not properlyfenced, would be more difficult to guard than Aga Khan&apos;s Palace in Poona.I doubt in these circumstances whether it is worth while reopening Sevagramquestion. In other respects Aga Khan&apos;s Palace can be regarded as &quot;homedomicile,&quot; since it is not a jail, and other conditions desired by Cabinet can be,and indeed have been, applied to Gandhi&apos;s detention there. As I have already made clear, substitution of restriction for physical detention would in this case have no advantage from our point of view.3. I have examined position in detail.so that Cabinet may see how mattersstand. But in the last few days I have been considering whole issue further, andI have provisionally reached following conclusions. I have put these to Council,who did not react too badly, but I made it clear that I was not asking them totake a decision, and that I did not propose to take decisions until closer tothe time.4. What I think probably wise solution is that on Gandhi&apos;s starting a fastand making it clear that it is a fast to death, we should, on the assumption thatsuch fast is for the achievement of his inadmissible demands, (a) warn him in thename of His Majesty&apos;s Government that we do not propose to interfere, that allfacilities for medical treatment, &amp;c, will be provided, but that decision in matter
is one which he must take himself; (b) immediately send Devadas Gandhi, hiseldest son, to join him at Aga Khan&apos;s Palace; (c) tell Devadas that we wouldprovide all possible facilities, doctors, medical or spiritual assistance, food, &amp;c.and that he has only to ask for anything he wants; and that we will also putDevadas in charge of arrangements inside Aga Khan&apos;s Palace and of Gandhi&apos;shealth; (d) that there will be no objection to Gandhi seeing a reasonable numberof visitors or friends from outside, that we leave selection of names to Devadas,but that we expect him to operate that permission in a reasonable sense, and toavoid any substantial number of people being let-in, and wholly to exclude press;(e) that we shall continue to keep Gandhi under treatment in these conditionsuntil he either abandons his fast or it has a fatal outcome.5. I am quite clear on further reflection that our earlier suggestion underwhich we should have set Gandhi at liberty to fast to death either at Sevagramor in the Aga Khan&apos;s Palace though no longer our prisoner, would not work forreason that the moment that he was known to have started a fast there would bean immense concourse of people anxious to dissuade him, to visit him or merely to-be spectators, and travelling in an extensive pilgrimage from all over India; also it would be most difficult to control the press, which would write up most excitingstories which would have an extremely bad effect on opinion here as well asabroad; while serious problems of public order might arise out of assembling andcontrol of crowds. My revised scheme, as I see it, meets these points. We retain our control (assuming Devadas Gandhi&apos;s readiness to co-operate) of entry to ghandi&apos;s precincts; we retain control of press; and no one can complain either that Gandhi has been forcibly fed or that he lacks any comfort, or medical orother attention for which he or his relations on his behalf may care to ask.6,   I shall welcome your reactions as soon as possible.Extracts from Defence of India Rides&quot;.9.
