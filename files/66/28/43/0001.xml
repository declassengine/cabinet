TrfIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42)&quot; 413.September 15, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK yAND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.NAVAL CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.1. AT a special meeting on Naval Construction held on the 6th August,*I was invited to examine, in consultation with the First Lord of the Admiralty,the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of Aircraft Production, theMemorandum [D.C.(S) (42) 73] on Fighter requirements of the Fleet Air Armwhich had been prepared by the Chief of Naval Air Services and the Air member for Supply and Organisation for submission to the Defence Committee (Supply).This examination was to aim at reducing the Fleet Air Arm Reserves to an agreedminimum, due consideration being given to the assumption that some Carrierlosses in future must be expected.2. Since the operation of aircraft from land bases is a normal responsibilityof the Royal Air Force, the Admiralty had already withdrawn their originalprovision of aircraft for shore-based fighter squadrons on condition that theR.A.F. should accept by the end of 1942 the commitments at present held by theAdmiralty in respect of certain shore-based operational squadrons of the fleet air Arm. Furthermore, the position with regard to the supply of the Firefly(two-seater fleet fighter) and united States fleet fighters has not been in question.A subsequent development is that the Ministry of Aircraft Production, at the instance of the Admiralty, have decided to stop production of the Firebrand(single-seater fleet fighter) in favour of the Seafire (Fleet version of the Spitfire).The issue has, therefore, been narrowed to the number of sea fires which theMinistry of Aircraft Production should supply to the Admiralty by the end of1943, in addition to 202 already agreed by the Air Ministry, and those to besupplied in lieu of Firebrand.3. Several meetings have been held and papers, including D.C. (S) (42) 74,76 and 78 have been produced. At the final meeting on 3rd September it became clear that there would be an insufficient total of Spitfires and sea fires to satisfy the respective demands of the Royal Air Force and the Fleet Air Arm and thaithere should be sacrifices on both sides.   The sacrifices I proposed were that: (a) The Air Ministry should reduce their demand for Spitfires until theend of 1943 by 120 (in addition to providing for the Fleet Air Arm80 obsolescent Spitfires and Hurricanes for training as already agreed).-i     (&amp;) The Admiralty should reduce  :(i) Reserves of Supernumerary Squadrons to 50 per cent, (from 100per cent.).(ii) Training reserves to&apos;80 per cent, (from 90 per cent.),(iii) Allowance for wastage of Supernumerary Squadrons to 4 percent, a month (instead of 8 per cent.).[24355-1]* MISC 33 (42), 1st Meeting.
* The Air Ministry state that this deficit of 75 will, however, be reduced to 30 by therecent.allotment of 45 Hurricane IIs by the Air Ministry to the Admiralty.4. This temporary arrangement will provide the Fleet Air Arm with some490 sea fires by the end of 1943,* of which some 350 may be fixed-wing and thebalance folding-wing. This will equate supply with the minimum needs of theAdmiralty by the end of 1943 but will mean a deficit of 75* at the middle of 1943and an inevitable deficiency in quality for some months. There is a limit, however,to the number of fixed-wing aircraft which the Admiralty can absorb and, there-fore, the rate at which this deficiency in quality can be relieved is governed by the speed at which the folding-wing can be developed and produced.5. The First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State for Air and theMinister of Aircraft Production have agreed to the above arrangement, but theFirst Lord wishes it to be placed on record that his acceptance of these reductions will involve great risks that Carriers will be under-provisioned andthat the reductions should be regarded as a temporary expedient to be made good as early as possible.6.   I submit these proposals for approval.(Initialled) O. L.Ministry of Production,Great George Street, S.W. 1.September 15, 1942.
