THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  August 1942.SECRET. . Copy No. 2\W.P. (42) 380.August 21, 1942.WAR CABINET.LEND-LEASE OPERATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 11th June, 1942, the President of the United States transmitted to congress the fifth Report on Operations under the Lend-Lease Act. Both the presidents &quot;letter of transmittal &quot; and the Report itself are of exceptionalinterest, and I am therefore circulating to my colleagues, annexed to thismemorandum, the text of the letter and certain extracts from the Report.2. As regards the figures of recommend-lease, it will be noticed that betweenMarch 1941 and May 1942 the volume of aid in goods and services has totalled$4,497 million. It is elsewhere stated in the Report that, during the same period,the value of articles transferred amounted to $2,601 million, of which$2,138 million have actually been exported. An interesting point is that,whereas from March 1941 to May 1942 the value of lend-lease exports amountedto 29 per cent, of the value of all United States exports, in May 1942 lend-leaseexports had reached approximately 54 per cent, of total exports.3. The Report is, however, much more than a factual account of lend-leaseaid and constitutes a. broad statement of the principles underlying Alliedcollaboration during the war and the future basis for the peace settlement. It ispossible to distinguish three main currents of thought: (a) The transfers made under lend-lease are emphatically distinguished from commercial loans and are regarded as contributions to a common pool.The evils of international indebtedness resulting from the last war are explicitly recognised, and the intention of avoiding them in futureis expressed.(b) The lend-lease programme is looked upon as one of the means of realisingthe economic effort promised in the Declaration of the United nations and is closely linked up with the future organisation of peace. (Atthe same time, I do not think we should be justified in reading intothis any suggestion that lend-lease will necessarily be continued afterthe war.)(c) As regards the organisation of peace, great stress is laid on the economicfoundations to be given to it; trade can only be restored and sustained,the Report argues, if exchange relationships are stabilised and liberal principles of commerce are applied.; A.

ANNEX A.President&apos;s Letter of Transmitted.This is the fifth ninety-day report to the Congress on operations under the Lend-Lease Act.For the three months ending the 31st May, 1942, lend-lease aid-amounted to more than 81,900 million. For the fifteen-month period from March 1941through May 1942, aid totalled $4,497 million in goods and services. We are now making aid available at a monthly rate equivalent to $8,000 million per year.Dollar figures do not portray all that is happening. The Congress has wiselyset few limits to the types of aid which may be and are being provided. Food over 5,000 million pounds and medicine have helped to sustain the British and russian and Chinese peoples in their gallant will to fight. Metals, machine tools and other essentials have aided them to maintain and step up their productionof munitions. The bombardment planes and the tanks which were ordered forthem last spring and summer are now putting their mark on the enemy. TheBritish pilots trained in this country have begun their work at Cologne and Essen.And lend-lease is no longer one way. Those who have been receiving lend-lease aid in their hour of greatest need have taken the initiative in reciprocating.To the full extent of their ability, they are supplying us, on the same lend-leasebasis, with ruanj- things we need now. American troops on Australian aridBritish soil are being fed and housed and equipped in part out of australian and British supplies and weapons. Our Allies have sent us special machine tools and equipment for our munitions factories. British anti-aircraft guns help usto defend our vital bases, and British-developed detection devices assist us tospot enemy aircraft. We are sharing the blue prints and battle experience of theUnited Nations.These things, invaluable as they have proven, are not the major benefit we will receive for our lend-lease aid. That benefit will be the defeat of the Axis.But the assistance we have been given by our partners in the common struggleis heartening evidence of the way in which the other United Nations are poolingtheir resources with our own. Each United Nation is contributing to the ultimatevictory not merely in dollars, pounds or roubles, but the full measure of its men,its weapons, and its productive capacity.Our reservoir of resources is now approaching flood stage. The next stepis for our military, industrial and shipping experts to direct its full force againstthe centres of enemy power. Great Britain and the United States have togetherset up expert combined bodies to do the job, in close co-operation with Russia,China and the other United Nations. They are equipping the United nations to fight this world-wide war on a world-wide basis. They are taking combinedaction to carry our men and weapons on anything that will float or fly to the places from which we can launch our offensives.By combined action now, we can preserve freedom and restore peace to ourpeoples. By combined action later, we can fulfil the victory we have joined to attain. The concept of the United Nations will not perish on the battlefields ofthis terrible war. It will live to lay the basis of the enduring world under-standing on which mankind depends to preserve its peace and its freedom.ANNEX B.Extract from Chapter 2 :  Ijend-Lease and the War.The United Nations have thus declared that they are more than a temporarymilitary combination, and that they will wage the war together for a commonvictory and a common programme of peace aims.To fight a common war which extends around the&apos;world, the United Nationsneed a common plan for the most effective possible use of their resources in menand materials and machines. All the battlefronts are linked together. TheUnited Nations are concentrating their weapons on those battleironts where
pressure is heaviest and where military success is of the greatest strategic importance. They are moving in a co-ordinated way toward organising offen-sives backed by their combined resources. .  .Our lend-lease programme is one means, and a simple one, by which thecommon economic effort pledged in the Declaration by United Nations may besecured. The lend-lease principle, as it develops, is removing the possibility thatconsiderations of finance can interfere with the full use of material resources.The transfers made under the Lend-Lease Act are not commercial loans to other nations. They are contributions of material to a common pool with which acommon war is being waged. In return, other United Nations are contributingtheir utmost to the common fight in men, materials and machines and arefurnishing us with the weapons and supplies which we, rather than they, canmost effectively use.ANNEX C.Extract from Chapter 3 : Lend-Lease and the Peace.We are now in the war, as we were not in March 1941 when the Lend-LeaseAct was passed. We have pledged our resources without limit to win the war,and the peace which will follow it. We look forward to a period of security andliberty, in which men may freely pursue lives of their choice, and governments will achieve policies leading to full and useful production and employment. Ifthe promise of the peace is to be fulfilled, a large volume of production and tradeamong nations must be restored and sustained. This trade must be solidlyfounded on stable exchange relationships and liberal principles of commerce. the Lend-lease settlement will rest on a specific and detailed programme for achievingthese ends, which are, as Article VII of the agreements with Great Britain, Chinaand Russia point out, &quot; the material foundations of the liberty and welfare of allpeoples.&quot; \ .   .Co-operative action among the United Nations is contemplated to fulfil this programme for economic progress, in the many spheres where action is needed.It is hoped that plans will soon develop for a series of agreements and recominen-dations for legislation, in the fields of commercial policy, of money and finance,international investment and reconstruction.Article VII of each of the basic agreements pledges that &quot;the terms andconditions &quot; of the final determination of the benefits to be provided the UnitedStates in return for aid furnished under the Act &quot; shall be such as not to burdencommerce between the two countries, but to promote mutually advantageouseconomic relations between them and the betterment of world-wide economic relations.&quot; By this provision we have affirmatively declared our intention toavoid the political and economic mistakes of international debt experience duringthe twenties.A lend-lease settlement which fulfils this principle will be sound from theeconomic point of view. But it will have a greater merit. It will represent, theonly fair way to distribute the financial costs of war among the United Nations.The real costs of the war cannot be measured, nor compared, nor paid forin money. They must and are being met in blood and toil. But the financialcosts of the war can and should be met in a way which will serve the needs oflasting peace and mutual economic well-being.All the United Nations are seeking maximum conversion to war production,in the light of their special resources. If each country devotes roughly the samefraction of its national production to the war, then the financial burden of waris distributed equally among the United Nations in accordance with their ability to pay. And although the nations richest in resources are able to make largercontributions, the claim of war against each is relatively the same&quot;. Such adistribution of the financial costs of war means that no nation will grow richfrom the war effort of its allies. The money costs of the war will fall accordingto the rule of equality in sacrifice, as in effort.
ANNEX D.Extract from Lend-Lease Act.(b) The terms and conditions upon which any such foreign Governmentreceives any aid authorised under sub-section (a) shall be those which thePresident deems satisfactory, and the benefit to the United States may be paymentor repayment in kind or property, or any other direct or indirect benefit whichthe President deems satisfactory.
