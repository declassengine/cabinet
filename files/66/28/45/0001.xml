DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)Jgj? RETJ\J42) 415 (Revise)-ST SEPTEMBER.  1942,COPY NOso. p7^WAR CABINETTHE RADIO board memorandum by the Minister of ProductionMost of my colleagues are already av/are of the proposalto establish a Radio Board.   As a result of a meeting of Ministerheld on the 28th August, and of subsequent action by the Chiefsof Staff Committee,-!-the following proposals for the creation ofthe Radio Board are now agreed by all parties concerned.20 Scope and terms of reference of the Board.    There was some discussion about the scope of the Board&apos;s functions,turning very largely on the question whether the Board should &apos;take over the whole of the functions hitherto performed by the radio Policy Sub-Committee of the Chiefs of Staff Committee,With the consent of the Chiefs of Staffj it is proposed thatthis should be done.    The Radio Policy Sub-Committee will therefore cease to exist, being considered as merged in theBoard, and the various subordinate bodies of the Radio PolicySub-Committee will continue to exist (where their functions arenecessary) as Committees of the Board,   The Board will, ingeneral, be responsible to the Minister of Production, but wherematters of service policy are concerned it will take itsinstructions from and be responsible to, the Chiefs of staff committee,    On this basis the proposed terms of reference of theBoard are set out in the Annex.     . &apos;3, Chairmanship.     My original suggestion was that ColonelLlewellin, in his personal capacity, should be Chairman of theBoardo   This was subsequently altered, in view of the represent-ations in paragraph 15 of Lord Justice du Parcq&apos;s report/^ and,after consultation with the Deputy Prime Minister and the lord president of the Council, I made the revised proposal that Ishould myself be Chairman of the Board.   At the meeting ofMinisters held on the 28th August, however, it was pointed outthat, if a member of the War Cabinet were Chairman, the other ministers concerned would feel compelled to attend meetings ofthe Radio Board in person.    There was also general agreement thatno charge of partiality would lie against Colonel Llewellin ifhe were to be Chairman.    I hav&amp;--therefore reverted to theoriginal plan and asked Colonel Llewellin in his personal capacity, to be Chairman.43 Denuty  Ghairmen.     It is agreed that -the two deputy chairmen should be the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministryof Production (Mr, G,M, Garro Jones, M,P,) and ProfessorG-oP, Thomson.*   C,0.3,(42) 391 and CO. S.

6o Membership.      There should be the following Departmentalrepresentation   on the Board:-3 representatives of the Admiralty,.2 representatives each of the War Office, the AirMinistry, the Ministry of Supply and the Ministryof Aircraft Production.1 representative of the General Post Office.The Chiefs of Staff have asked to be consulted on the servicerepresentatives - I take it that Service Ministers would naturallyconsult their Chiefs of Staff before making their nominations.Liaison officers to the Board should be appointed by the Ministryof Production, the Chiefs of Staff Committee and the BritishJoint Corrmunications Board.    The Board should have the power toco-opt a limited number of other members, either generally orfor specific purposes.    It is understood that the personnel of committees of the Board need not be confined to members of theBoard itself.60 Secretariat.      It is proposed that Wing CommanderD..Ho Johnson (who is at present Joint Secretary of the RadioPolicy Sub-Committee, Secretary of the R.D0F. Assignment Sub-Committee of the London Munitions Assignment Board, and theSecretary of the R.D.F. Board) shall be Secretary of the RadioBeardo    His staff, which will require some reinforcement,especially on the civil and scientific EEide, is at present borne,for convenience only, on the establishment of the Air Ministry,and it would be convenient if this arrangement   could becontinued..,?0 Collaboration with the United States of America.    If these,...eposals are approved, I propose to confeult with the Chairman ofthe Board on the form and method of a communication to the UnitedStates authorities, informing them of the creation of the Boardend of its authority and functions, and proposing the establishmentof direct communication between the Board and the appropriate body or bodies on the American side.    It would be an advantage ifthe United States Government were similarly to set up a singleauthoritative body.80 I invite the concurrence of my colleagues in the above proposals.(Initialled)   0,LUMinistry of Production,Great George Street, S.W.1.21st September, 1942.AMEBXTERMS OP REFERENCE OF THE RADIO board the Radio Board shall be responsible for ensuring that there-&apos;-s a single coherent policy on the development and production of radio cciuipment, on scientific research for that purpose and onsuch questions of inter-service radio policy as may be determinedby the Chiefs of Staff Committee.
