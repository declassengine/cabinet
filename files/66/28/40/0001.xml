THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT225Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1942.Copy No.   i i1  secret.VW.P. (42) 410.September 14, 1942.WAR CABINET.PROPOSED UNITED  STATES MISSION  TO  THE  MIDDLE  EAST.ON the 7th September I circulated to my colleagues in the Cabinet the text of a communication which I had received&apos; from the American Embassy inLondon informing me of the desire of the United States Government to manifesttheir interest, and contribute to the war effort, in the Middle East area by takingthree steps : (a) the appointment of a diplomatic agent to the Levant States, the indepen-dence of which the United States Government have not so farrecognised and in which they are at present represented by consular officers;(b) the issue of a declaration addressed to countries comprised in the middle east area; and(c) the despatch of a Special Mission under Colonel Hoskins, with very wideterms of reference, to operate within that area.2. The Colonial Office and other Departments and organisations concerned have been consulted on the subject of these American proposals, and the subjoinedMemorandum, which has been prepared in the Foreign Office, is understood torepresent their views, as well as those of my Department. With the agreement ofthe Prime Minister, I am handing this Memorandum to the United states ambassador to-morrow.3. Put briefly, we are prepared heartily to welcome the -suggested appoint-ment of a diplomatic agent in the Levant States, and even to refrain fromopposing the issue by the United States Government independently of a declara-tion of interest in the Middle East area, provided the terms originally proposed are somewhat modified and that we are given an opportunity of seeing the revised version. What we feel bound to resist, however, is the despatch in presentcircumstances of an American Special Mission which would in effect be equivalentto that of our own Minister of State to an area which is not only (with theexception of Turkey) a British military zone, but in which no urgent need for thepresence of such an American Mission appears to exist, while, on the contrary,there are many arguments against the despatch of such a Mission. The Replysuggests to the United States Government that their purposes in this respectcould more fittingly be achieved by the appointment of specialised personnel towork with the appropriate British authorities.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.A. E.Foreign Office, September 14, 1942.11852   [24350]
ANNEX.Memorandum for presentation to the United States Ambassador.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government have not failed to give most careful attentionto the aide-memoire received from the American Embassy under date the31st August, in which the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government is invited on certain political action contemplated by the United States Government in theMiddle East, and on the proposed despatch of a special American Mission tothose regions.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government fully appreciate the wish of the UnitedStates Government to utilise for the purposes of the war ail the great reserves of goodwill which the United States had undoubtedly built up in the Middle Eastby decades of philanthropic and cultural enterprise. They agree that it is highly desirable to make the most effective use possible of these reserves, and of thegreat influence Avhich the United States enjoy, for other reasons, in those terri-tories as elsewhere, and they cordially welcome the intention of the United StatesGovernment to appoint a Diplomatic Agent in Syria and the Lebanon. Asregards the proposed public declaration, His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise the value of any step that would stimulate the Middle Eastern peoples to increasethe degree of their participation in the resistance of the Axis aggressors, and ifthe United States Government are of the opinion that this object can satisfactorilybe advanced by the issue of a declaration, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not wish to raise objection. At the same time, they must, in all frankness, say thatthey see very considerable dangers in addressing a statement in the form proposedto the regions in question, and should the United States Government be prepared,as His Majesty&apos;s Government sincerely hope, to reconsider the wording of thedraft statement His Majesty&apos;s Government would greatly appreciate an oppor-tunity to consider any revised formula.3. In the first place, the stress laid in the draft declaration on the promotion of &quot; liberty &quot; and &quot; freedom &quot; appears inappropriate when applied to a regionin which all the countries specified, with the exceptions of Palestine and Trans-jordania and the possible further exception of the Levant States, already enjoyindependence qualified only by the exigencies of the war situation and therequirements of the Allied forces operating within their boundaries.4. Such a declaration followed by the announcement on the American sideof the intention to despatch a Special Mission would, in the view of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, incur the precise risk of strengthening that Axis influence and thatAxis propaganda which it is the express intention of the proposal to combat.The meaning of the draft declaration would infallibly be taken in the countries to which it is intended to apply as containing both an implication that &quot; liberty &quot;is being withheld and an assurance that it is the intention of the United StatesGovernment to hasten its achievement. No implications could be more welcome to Axis propaganda, could be more readily turned against the occupying forces or could be more calculated to increase the tension of the existing situation and to threaten the security of the Allied Command.5. On the other hand, and as regards the areas covered by the proposed mission which do enjoy full independence, His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot butfeel that the suggested mission and the draft declaration are liable to be misinterpreted as regards Palestine, both by Jews and Arabs, in a sense whichcould hardly fail to have dangerous repercussions. As regards Syria and the lebanon, as the United States Government are aware, the situation is complicated,in so far as the fulfilment of the Anglo-French recognition of independence isimpeded by the obstruction of the Fighting French administration, while thetense military situation in Egypt renders it difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment on their side to apply the pressure which they would otherwise wish tobring. American help in securing this fulfilment, afforded at the right time andin the right manner, will be heartily welcomed by His Majesty&apos;s Government.But the proposals now advanced, in so far as they refer to these areas, seem toHis Majesty&apos;s Government, calculated to provoke a state of popular agitationand excitement which, at the present time, it would be very difficult to meet.
6. A special word must be said about Turkey. Although His Majesty&apos;sGovernment feel that the proposed declaration is hardly appropriate to thatcountry, they are anxious to make clear that the arrangements which the UnitedStates Government may wish to make for the utilisation, and the increase, in theinterest of the United Nations war effort, of their undoubted influence in Turkeyare, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, essentially a question between theUnited States and the Turkish Governments. His Majesty&apos;.s Government, fortheir part, if only in view of their Treaty of Alliance with Turkey and the delicate political situation in regard to that country, welcome the evidentreadiness of the United States Government to keep them acquainted with theaction which they may propose to take. ^7. As regards the Special Mission, the United States Government will be aware from enquiries made a few weeks ago, both through His Majesty&apos;s embassy in Washington and through Mr. Phillips in London, that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment knew that such a mission was under discussion in Washington. since then the implications of the proposal, even without the full details which theUnited States Government have now been so good as to supply, have naturallybeen the subject of careful and mature study in London. While fully recognising that a valuable part might be played by an emissary with local and specialisedknowledge and other qualifications. His Majesty&apos;s Government feel bound, in existing circumstances and in an area the greater part of which is at presentincluded in a British military zone, strongly to deprecate the despatch of a mission with activities which are both political and diplomatic, propagandist andsubversive (post-occupational). As to these last, they would urge that themodus vivendi arrived at by the two Departments concerned should be adhered to.since experience has shown that work of this nature, when conducted in ares which have not yet fallen under enemy occupation, carries grave risks whichcan only be met by the acceptance of full control over such work by the military command within the area.8. In respect of the other activities mentioned in the Embassy&apos;s memo-randum, His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome the appointment of specialised American personnel to work with the appropriate British authorities on all these matters. In general they welcome the intention of the United StatesGovernment that American propaganda should be greatly and rapidly increased in the interest of the United Nations war effort throughout the Middle East,where the soil, for the reasons pointed out in the American Embassymemorandum, should be peculiarly fertile.
