This is set out below under four heads. The information at (I) and (III) has been provided by the Ministry of War Transport. I had hoped to include a section on tanker building in the United States with an indication of delivery prospects. At the present moment, however, the war shipping Administration are revising their estimates, and have not been able togive the Ministry of War Transport the new figure. It will no doubt be madeavailable to the Cabinet at the first opportunity.I. Total Tanker Tonnage available at Present.The Ministry of War Transport are in process of agreeing with the war shipping Administration comprehensive lists of merchant tonnage outside enemy control. This complete information is not expected to be available for about twomonths.The best information at present available to the Ministry of War transport is summarised in the following table : British-Controlled Ocean-Going Tanker Tonnage.ThousandAs at July 31, 1942. Number.     gross tons.(a) British Flag Vessels    ......      ...    ....      375 2,584(b) Vessels time-chartered to the United KingdomGovernment or to British interests......      190 1,460(c) Other vessels operating in British interests(excluding United States and Panamanianvessels) ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 1 10.   566 4,054United States-Controlled Ocean-Going Tanker Tonnage.ThousandNumber.    D.W. tons.(d) United States Flag vessels (as at 1st July,1942)-Merchant Service ......      ...      246 2,932United States Army and Navy    ......        97 1.262(e) Foreign Flag vessels (United States Control)as at 31st May, 1942 ..........        78 770421 4,964The total of 4,964 thousand deadweight tons was estimated to be equivalentto about 3,180 thousand gross tons.   Some of the vessels under (d) and.(e) are at[24318]
present engaged in fulfilling the British programme. There are also a certainnumber of Allied tankers at present engaged in fulfilling the British programme,but which are under the control of their respective Governments.II. Ocean-going Tankers Building in United Kingdom and British Empire,with an Indication of Delivery Prospects.Thousands of number.   Gross tons.Total on order at the 31st July, 1942 .........      49 401Of which there were on the berths or fitting out      35 290Estimated deliveries-1942-3rd Quarter ...............       10 894th Quarter .........      ......        9 77Adding 15 vessels of 128,000 tons deliveredduring the first six months brings the total for 1942 to     ...............      34 2941943-1st Quarter ...      ...      ...      ...      ...        5 412nd Quarter        ...      ...      ...      ...      ...        8 663rd Quarter ...............      10 844th Quarter .........      ...      ...        8 671943 total      31 258The figures for the second half of 1943 include three 15-knot vessels,which will be the first of a programme of such ships recently approved.During 1944 it can be assumed that the tonnage of tanker deliveries,according to present plans, is not likely to be less -than 1943. but they will include a larger proportion of the 15-knot type.No tankers are building in the British Empire outside the United Kingdom.III. Present Prospects of Allocations to us and the Allies whoseShipping we control of Tankers from Future American Production.The Ministry. of War Transport have suggested to the War Shipping-Administration that a joint examination should be made of the United Nations&apos;tanker and oil position. Until such an examination has been made it is impossibleto forecast the service to which new American tankers will be allocated.IV. Estimated Future Losses.The actual losses of vessels of 1,600 gross tons and over on an occurrence basis in- the first 7 months (adjusted to allow for losses yet to be confirmed) of1942 were : BritishControlled.
