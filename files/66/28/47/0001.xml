An account is also included of the equipment and materials which have been provided overand above the promises made at Moscow.(Initialled) A. E.Great George Street, S.W. 1,September 17, 1942.REPORT ON SUPPLIES TO RUSSIA,OCTOBER, 1941, TO JUNE, 1942.Part I.-MEMORANDUM BY THE CHAIRMAN, ALLIED SUPPLIESEXECUTIVE.The Confidential Protocol signed at Moscow on the 2nd October, 1941, byLord Beaverbrook on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government provided for materialaid to Russia over a period which ended on the 30th June, 1942.2. I have thought that it would be of interest to my colleagues to have beforethem a comprehensive statement of the extent to which our commitments havebeen fulfilled, and of the additional help which we have rendered to the SovietGovernment over the same period.3. The Report below has been prepared under my direction in order to givea detailed account of our achievements in these two respects. It covers all supplies despatched on United Kingdom account, whether they have been carried in British, American, Russian or other Allied ships. A brief description of thecentral organisation responsible for these results is given in Appendix 1 onpage 26.[24344] B
4.   The salient points in this Report may be summarised as follows : (a) We have duly fulfilled our obligation to make available at British centres of production all the military goods listed in the Protocol which wehave agreed with the United States Government that the UnitedKingdom should provide. The figures are given in Table A onpage 17.(b) Over and above our Protocol commitments, and not counting the suppliesfurnished before the Protocol came into effect which amounted tosome 30,000 tons by the Northern route alone we have provided193 tanks, 22 fighter aircraft, 82 Bren carriers and 3,000 M.T. vehicles.Large quantities of miscellaneous Naval, Military and Air Forceequipment and chemical warfare stores not mentioned in the Protocol,for which we have been asked from time to time since last October,have also been furnished. Details will be found in Table C on pages 19-21.(c) The British and American Governments did not undertake to deliver thesupplies promised at Moscow to Soviet territory; they have, however,provided nearly all the shipping tonnage by the Northern route, both from the United Kingdom and North America, and by the Southernroute from the United States. The Minister of War Transport hasfound 87 per cent, of the vessels which sailed from the UnitedKingdom up to the end of June; these ships have carried all the high priority military cargoes in the United Kingdom quotas, with, theexception of the Valentine tanks and Bren carriers from Canadian- production.(d) In the first fourteen convoys our shipping losses by the Northern routewere remarkably low; we lost in convoy only three merchant ships,one of which was sunk on the homeward voyage. In the last threeconvoys, however, we have unfortunately lost 13 vessels (one of them- Dutch) out of the 27 carrying March, April and May quotas. Thefull figures are given in the Tables, but in these convoys alone250 fighter aircraft, 303 tanks, 88 anti-tank guns and a large quantityof ammunition, spares and other goods were sunk, besides 70 CanadianValentines and 151 Bren carriers loaded on American ships.(e) Nevertheless, in the face of most determined enemy attacks by surface,submarine and air forces, and in spite of extremely severe weather conditions during the winter months, our convoys, which have included a large number of vessels sailing from North America, and their navalescorts have steadily fought their way through to North Russia withundaunted courage; even the exceptional hazards of these Arcticvoyages have not deterred British and Allied merchant seamen fromvoluntarily engaging, time after time, in these perilous tasks. In all218 ships have been escorted.(/) Under the direction of the War Office, and with the efficient help of theU.K.C.C., the military authorities have carried out a large-scale development of the capacity of the Persian Gulf ports and an expansion of the inland clearance facilities by road, rail and water transport. A measure of the progress which has been made may be judged from the fact that three times the amount of shipping wasloaded for Russia by this route in June than in January. If thedevelopment of these facilities has been less rapid than we could have wished -largely owing to the disappointing deliveries of brakedrolling-stock from the United States and even though much remains to be done, the volume of goods destined for Russia which have arrivedat the Persian Gulf ports by sea or have travelled overland from india had not, up to the end of June, exceeded the capacity of the transport services to clear it.(cj) The Service Departments have made an ungrudging contribution of spares and ammunition for aircraft, tanks and weapons on a scalefar exceeding that which our own forces have required. The provisionof spares for tanks and aircraft on such a scale has been a matter of very great difficulty, and has been achieved at heavy cost to our. own production of finished materiel. But I am sure that this is a wisepolicy; it is not for us to set up our experiences or our methods ascriteria to which the Russians should necessarily conform.
(h) The severe restrictions imposed on us by the Japanese seizure of theprincipal Far Eastern sources of supply of raw materials made itnecessary to reduce the quotas of rubber and tin during the last threemonths of the Protocol period. Apart, however, from these reductions,all the raw materials from the overseas Empire, except some 2,600 tonsof rubber and 5,000 tons of cocoa, have been made available in full.But the shipment of raw materials has been held up for lack of sufficient Soviet tonnage, and because the Soviet authorities haveassigned to other materials.priority for the available shipping space.Table B on page 15 shows the position. .(i) Although we undertook no commitment at the Moscow Conference inrespect of foodstuffs (other than cocoa), we have shipped about77,000 tons of sugar and 107,000 tons of wheat and flour from Empiresources; and have also allowed the Russians to purchase substantial quantities of Ceylon tea, Indian tobacco and other items. The listof explosives and chemicals, pigments, textile materials, marine and port equipment, telecommunication apparatus, machinery and toolswhich have&apos;been promised or provided, in addition to the materialsmentioned in the Protocol, is too long and detailed for inclusion inthis Report; it runs into about 200 items of great variety.(j) A generous allotment has been made of our output of machine tools, the flow of which, though uneven to start with, has recently beenaccelerated. The total value of present agreed supplies, deliveries ofwhich will extend over the end of 1942, amounts to well over 5^ million. This represents. about one-quarter of the enquiryaddressed to the United. States and ourselves at Moscow.(k) We have authorised the manufacture for Russia of industrial and*electrical equipment valued at about  15 million. Of this, a little over 1 million worth has so far been shipped, and the bulk will not beproduced until 1943. Deliveries of industrial diamonds (all of whichhave been sent by air) have exceeded by some 60 per cent, the amount which we undertook to provide.(Z) A large proportion of the list of medical and surgical supplies for whichenquiry was made of the United States and United Kingdom Govern-ments has been found from the United Kingdom and India, and thecost some  420,000 has been generously borne by Mrs. Churchill&apos;sRed Cross &apos;&apos; Aid to Russia &apos;&apos; Fund. Other British organisations havealso contributed to the medical needs of the Soviet forces and civilian population,(m) We have asked for no payment from the Soviet Government for militarygoods. The value of those which have been provided hitherto free-of cost on lend-lease terms is estimated to amount to over  50 millions.For other supplies, which are estimated to amount to a total of 28^ millions, cash/credit terms have been arranged, the creditafforded having been recently increased to  35 millions.5. It was perhaps hardly to be expected that the supplies which we had hoped to receive from the Soviet Union during the period under review would reach. the level which we should have desired, but we should be able to look forward to an improvement in this respect when more time can be given to loadinghomeward-bound ships at Soviet ports. This is, of course, dependent on futureconvoys getting through to North Russia.6. The manner in which, despite the many obstacles, we fulfilled our obliga-tions under the first Protocol undoubtedly impressed the Soviet Government, andhas had the important political effect of helping to convince them of the sincerity of our collaboration.[24344]
Part II.-NOTE BY THE SECRETARIAT, ALLIED SUPPLIESEXECUTIVE.A. Moscow Conference and Organisation.The Confidential Protocol of October 1, 1941.1. THE proceedings of the Moscow Conference, which resulted in the signature of the Confidential Protocol, dated the 1st October, 1941, betweenGreat Britain, the United States and the U.S.S.R., were circulated to the WarCabinet on the 8th October, 1941, as W.P. (41) 238 by Lord Beaverbrook, as chairman of the British Mission.2. The Protocol set forth a list of 70 detailed items of supplies enquiredfor by the U.S.S.R.,. together with the decisions of the British and United states government in satisfaction of those enquiries. In many cases the supplydepended upon further investigations in London and Washington and upon thereceipt of specifications or further details, but by the 10th November, 1941,Lord Beaverbrook was able to send to the Soviet Ambassador a consolidated list(A.S.E. (41.) 8) showing the joint Anglo-American decisions on all but four* of the items specified in the Protocol.3. The Protocol quotas were to be &quot; made available at British and UnitedStates centres of production within the period beginning from October, 1941, untilthe end ofJune, 1942.&quot; Great Britain and the United States would &quot; give aid to the transportation of these materials to the Soviet Union and will help withthe delivery.&quot;4. In addition to the 70 items listed in the Protocol, there were threeAnnexes, setting out (i) a programme of requirements for the Russian Navy;(ii) a programme of 83 items of surgical instruments, medicaments and chemicals; and(iii) a list of supplies which Great Britain wished to obtain from theSoviet Union.5. The Protocol contained an &quot; escalator &quot; clause providing for adjustmentby consultation &quot; in the event of the war situation changing and the burden ofdefence being transferred to other theatres of war.&quot; Although this provision hasnot been specifically invoked, the entry of Japan into the war necessarily involved a tacit agreement between the three Powers that the situation had thereby altered.On the supply side the principal&apos; feature resulting from this change has been the assignment by the Combined Raw Materials Board in Washington of the pooledresources of the United Nations in respect of raw materials, the sources of whichin Malaya, the Netherlands East Indies and Burma had been cut off by theJapanese invasion.A administrative Machinery.6. The task of directing, on behalf of the War Cabinet, the allocation andshipment of supplies to Russia (other than major military items, for theallocation of which the Defence Committee was to be responsible) was entrustedby the Prime Minister to a Ministerial Committee. This body, which is knownas the Allied Supplies Executive, operates under the chairmanship of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Eden). Its first Chairman was theMinister of Supply (Lord Beaverbrook). It is assisted by a small branch ofthe War Cabinet Secretariat.* Magnesium alloys.Bimetal.Calibrated steel.Nitro-glycerine powder.
ih, iLn&amp;   a 1?tlo^ls 111 Part IV, Appendix 1, of the composition ofthe Executive during the period under review, and of the administrative arrange-ments made for the transaction of its business. Notes are included on the authorised channels of communication with the Soviet authorities, on methods ofT*^Zn 7^- &quot;he ^^d States and on the proposal for the establishmentol a Supply Section of His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Kuibyshev.B. Transportation.General.8. It was recognised at the Moscow Conference that the transportation ofthe supplies to be provided under the Protocol would present a formidableproblem. A total of 1\ million tons of shipping was estimated to be requiredto lift this programme, towards which the Soviet Government could offer90,000 tons of carrying capacity, about 33 per cent, of which would be allottedfor the Pacific.9. At the outset three supply routes to the U.S.S.R, were open, with an estimated maximum monthly tonnage capacity as follows : -Tons.(a) Archangel...............      ...      300,000(b) Vladivostok        ...      .........      ...      140,000(c) Persian Gulf...............        60,000The Soviet Government were unwilling to allow Murmansk to be used formilitary supplies at any rate owing to its vulnerable position, and, in fact, that port was not employed until early in 1942, when, notwithstanding the assurances of the Russians, the Archangel group of ports became inaccessible. Little usehas, in fact, been made of the Vladivostok route since the Japanese intervention in the war. The limiting factor in the North Russian route was at first thenumber of berths and later the number of places in convoys. In the Persian Gulfroute the limiting factor has been inland clearance. The Northern route hasthroughout been used to the limit; although the theoretical capacity of theSouthern route has not been fully used, tonnage has been laid on up to theestimated amount which the route could handle, subject to some interruptionduring the period of switch from the Indian Ocean to the North Americanloading area as the principal source of supplies.Northern Route.10. Between October, 1941, and the end of June, 1942, 17 convoys,comprising 100 merchant ships, have carried British Protocol supplies by this route from the United Kingdom. These vessels have sailed at an average rateof 11 per month, but there have necessarily been wide variations in the intervalsbetween sailings for operational reasons. The time taken between loading ports in the United Kingdom and the port of arrival in North Russia has variedbetween 17 days and over 2 months.11. Except during the month of April, 1942, at least two convoys per monthhave arrived regularly in North Russia up to the end of May, but during theearly part of the period, although sailings were planned on a 10-day cycle,frequent complaints were received from the Soviet Embassy and the trade delegation regarding the late shipment of high priority goods; during the winterdifficulties imposed by the severe weather particularly in connexion with themovement of aircraft often made it impossible to clear the whole of each monthlyquota from loading ports by the end of the month. Although the point was made that the first convoy carrying Protocol supplies had not left this country until the17th October, and that consequently some part of. each month&apos;s supplies had to-be carried forward into the early.days of the succeeding month, the back log(which was aggravated by the largeynumbers of lorries which at that time werebeing shipped in &apos;&apos; completely asslmbled &apos;&apos; form (see paragraph 28)) becameacute.   The matter was reported by the Chairman to the Prime Minister, who
was in Washington at the time, and who issued a Directive on the 4th Januaryenjoining all Departments to ensure that January quotas were shipped in fullbefore the end of that month. Although this could not be literally fulfilled, animprovement resulted.12. Meanwhile the consent of the Soviet authorities had been obtained forthe use of Murmansk for the handling of supplies, but it nevertheless became apparent in March. 1942, that the increasing danger of attacks on convoys by enemy surface vessels, as well as by aircraft and submarines, made it necessaryto limit the number of sailings in each month, and also the number of ships to beescorted in any convoy, to not more than 25. At the same time, as a result of a directive issued by the President in January, the United States authorities had begun to despatch ships at an ever-increasing rate e.g., 14 ships sailed from north America in February, 32 in March and 56 in April, although even larger numbers than these had been allocated.13. Shuttle Service. On the 10th February^ proposals were accepted inprinciple by the Executive for the institution of a trans-Atlantic shuttle service.One of the&apos;principal objects of the scheme was to provide building-up cargo topromote economical shipment of military goods. Under this the Russians wouldhave allocated a number of ships to bring extra foodstuffs and raw materials from north America to the United Kingdom, in return for which we would havereleased a corresponding amount of similar goods for shipment from the UnitedKingdom to Russia. Negotiations were opened with the Soviet authorities, but did not result in any agreement. After the breakdown of the negotiations,arrangements were madet by the Ministry of Food to release up to 4,000 tonsof wheat a month, without a compensating- allocation of tonnage, since otherwise it would have been necessary to take two ships a month off the United kingdom import programme to provide an equivalent amount of cargo for the Russians.It became unnecessary, however, to continue this arrangement in May and June,since in those months bulk foodstuffs taken from United States ships dischargedin the United Kingdom for restowage, together with large quantities of corditeand bleaching-powder, provided the building-up material needed by the Ministryof War Transport.14. Convoy Arrangements. On the 22nd April]: the Minister of war transport drew the attention of the Executive to the congestion which was to beexpected in Iceland as a result of the limitations mentioned in paragraph&apos;12,and foreshadowed the arrangements (which were afterwards introduced) bywhich United States ships carrying low priority cargoes would be brought to united Kingdom ports for discharge and restowage in such a way as to providethe maximum quantity of high priority cargo in the minimum number of ships.This arrangement was not introduced without difficulty, after the matter hadbeen taken up with the United States Government on the highest level, and had also formed the subject of an exchange of telegrams between Premier Stalin andthe Prime Minister. Although the Admiralty have been pressed to take moreships in each convoy, the increasing risks and the dangers of the passage, as wellas the serious losses sustained by our escorting Naval vessels and by the supplyships, have deterred the Naval Staff from agreeing to increase the number ofvessels escorted to more than 35.North Russian Ports.15. Archangel was never able to use more than 9-11 berths and became unusable towards the end of December on account of ice conditions.The inability of the Soviet authorities to provide adequate ice-breaking facilities,and the damage by enemy action to the large icebreaker Stalin early in Januarymade it impossible to reopen that port until June.16.   At Murmansk only eight ships at a time could be handled to begin with&apos;and labour conditions were unsatisfactory.   Later, however, the position greatly improved as a result of successful Russian improvisation, and, until the town was partly destroyed by repeated bombing attacks at the end of June, the port was* A.S.E.

in full operation and was not unduly congested. Although five vessels three british, two American were sunk in the harbour (two partly discharged andthree after discharge), practically the whole volume of supplies delivered atthe port was cleared without loss.Siberian Ports.17. The port of Vladivostok was extensively used, before the entry of Japaninto the war, for the import of raw materials from the Far East and Austral-asia tin, lead, rubber and wool. But the shipping tonnage at the disposal of theRussians for this^route was limited to their own vessels, since British-controlledships were not available for voyages north of Hong Kong in waters underJapanese naval control. The port capacity of Vladivostok has, therefore, never been fully employed, and after the sinking of two Soviet merchant ships byJapanese submarines in Netherlands East Indies waters, very few goods havebeen lifted from British Empire sources for Siberian ports. Some shipments of wool and lead have, however, recently been made from Australasia to Petro-pavlovsk, and there have been fairly frequent shipments from the North american and Pacific Coasts.Persian Gulf Ports.18. It was laid down in W.P. (G) (41) 111 that &quot;the primary responsi-bility for all arrangements to improve road and rail transport in the persian gulf area and for port development (therein) must rest with .... the WarOffice,&quot; and the respective responsibilities of the War Office and of the allied supplies Executive were afterwards defined by the Prime Minister in w.P. (G) (41) 153. Under these rulings the function of the Executive wasrestricted to the allocation of capacity on the railways and roads in the persian gulf area for carrying supplies to Russia. The United Kingdom CommercialCorporation act as agents for the War Office in running local transport services(excluding railways).19. At the Moscow Conference it was expected that the capacity of these routes would be developed up to a figure of 60,000 tons per month, but in the lightof experience of the capacity of Archangel during the winter and with the virtualclosing of the Siberian routes by the war with Japan, it became evident that alarge increase in capacity of the trans-Persian routes would be necessary. Theauthorities on the spot were asked to think in terms of a target of 250,000 tons per month, but it was recognised that a rate of not more than 100,000 tons amonth for Russia would be likely to be attained before the end of 1942. this figure was approved by the Executive on the 9th December, 1941* In fact thequantity of goods presented for clearance through Persia, excluding the overlandroute via Meshed, up to the end of the Protocol period, has never exceeded30,000 tons in any month, exclusive of lease-lend lorries and aircraft.20. It was decided on the 12th june to substitute for the system of alloca-ting estimated inland clearance capacity an allocation based on the deadweighttonnage of estimated arrivals in the Persian Gulf. Any excess of arrivals overclearance capacity could be stored at the ports or diverted to Karachi for deliveryoverland. By this method it is hoped to ensure an adequate flow of supplies to the ports, so that clearance can proceed continuously.21. A large part of the cargo for the U.S.S.R. hitherto routed by thePersian Gulf has consisted of trucks shipped &apos;&apos; semi-knocked-down &apos;&apos; from theUnited States. A project of the American Mission under General Wheeler (nowColonel Shingler) to erect an assembly plant for &quot; completely knocked-down &quot;trucks, first at Karachi and later at Andimeshk, fell through after long negotia-tions. There are, however, now in operation at Andimeshk two &quot; Beta Pack &quot;plants for the erection of &quot; semi-knocked-down &quot; vehicles, the second of whichStarted to operate in June. Meanwhile,&quot; the United Kingdom CommercialCorporation early in February opened a similar plant at Bushire, primarily fortheir own vehicles which are used to carry supplies for Russia to the Caspian* A.S.E. (41) 5th Meeting,&apos;Minute 4, Conclusion (b).f A.S.E. (42) 13th Meeting, Minute 4.
ports; in view of the shortage of capacity for assembling trucks at Andimeshk, theU.K.C.C. plant, which can now erect 2,000 trucks a month, has assembled a quan-tity of American trucks for the U.S.S.R. which have helped to carry supplies ontheir journey north to the delivery points, e.g., Tabriz and Pahlevi.Zahidan-Meshed Roxite.22. In August 1941 the Chiefs of Staff agreed that the East Persia lorryroute (Nokkundi-Meshed) should be developed. In December of that year theChiefs of Staff,- after consulting the Government of India, agreed that onstrategical grounds there was no objection to the capacity of this route being increased to relieve possible congestion of supplies for the&quot; U.S.S.R. via thePersian Gulf. When responsibility for Persia had been transferred fromCommander-in-Chief, India, to Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, negotiations were continued with Cairo.23. Failure to secure trucks from the United States 3,000 5- and-tonners are regarded as necessary to develop the route to capacity -has hithertoimpeded progress. But as early as August 1941, on the initiative of the UnitedKingdom Commercial Corporation, a limited quantity of jute, shellac and othergoods for Russia were sent by this route in lorries chartered from Persian con-tractors by the East Persian Auxiliary Transport Service, which operated underthe Commander-in-Chief, India. The railway from Nokkundi to Zahidan hasbeen relaid by the Chief Engineer, India.24. At the end of June, 1942, the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation,at the request of the War Office, took over the operation of the route, startingwith trucks sufficient to carry 1,200 tons a month with the prospect of an earlyincrease. The arrival of the 3,000 lorries ordered by the War Office from theUnited States is not, however, expected before October. Eventually it shouldbe possible to increase capacity to 15,000 tons a month, subject to railway traffic conditions in India permitting this tonnage to be lifted by rail from Karachi toZahidan; the capacity of the railway to carry this tonnage is not in doubt.C. Military Supplies.Aircraft and R.A.F. Supplies under the Protocol.25. From the end of December, when the deficiency due to transport difficulties (see paragraph 11) was 81 aircraft, the monthly commitments of200 Fighters has been punctually fulfilled, and on two occasions exceeded byadvancing the shipment of a proportion of the following month&apos;s supply.26. The fulfilment of the commitment has put a great strain upon our resources of Fighters, particularly of Hurricanes, of which over 1,600 have beensent.A rmy Supplies under the Protocol.27. Army supplies have gone forward punctually for shipment during theperiod, although there have been difficulties resulting in delay to the loading ofM/T vehicles from the United Kingdom and Valentine tanks and Bren carriersfrom Canada. This is an achievement of some note, since the equipmentcomprised armoured fighting vehicles (tanks and Bren carriers) with theirarmament and ammunition and anti-tank weapons. Moreover, during 1941127 tanks over and above the British quota were despatched to make updeficiencies inthe American supply.28. Great difficulty was experienced in despatching the 3,000 M/T vehicleswhich were offered from United Kingdom stocks to compensate for the lag onshipments from the United States. This was eventually solved by the Russiansagreeing in January to accept boxed trucks for reassembly in North Russia in place of fully-assembled wheeled vehicles. As a result of this arrangement, thefull quota was shipped before the end of March,, by which they had been promised.29. Canadian Valentines have come forward punctually for shipment since march, but congestion at North Atlantic ports caused delay. Of. the total commit-ment of 596 up to the 30th June, 150 had reached the U.S.S.R. by that date, but no less than 270 were afloat; 100 of these were en route for the Persian Gulf.
30. The Russian requirement of tanks mounting armament heavier thanthe 2-pdr. tank gun and with better armour protection was met by shipment ofa proportion of A. 22 tanks from May onwards the earliest date on which this type was considered sufficiently developed to send overseas. Twenty-five were sent in May and 62 more were shipped in June. Of this total 55 were armed with the 6-pdr. gun.31. A request for new and increased scales of ammunition supply hasrecenty been met, mainly in full, but it is not possible to bring the supply up tothis scale for all the weapons already in U.S.S.R., particularly the Besas,Thompson sub-machine guns and Boys A/T rifles.Naval Supplies under the Protocol.32. The majority of Naval requests are not mentioned in the MoscowProtocol, Annex 1. One Protocol item has been supplied in full, viz., 9 mine-sweeping trawlers (two of which were sunk). Three types of A.A. Machine gunshave also been sent, and more are being allocated as they become available. Fifty130-mm. guns (with mechanisms and spare barrels) are being manufactured;shipment is due to start in August. Of the 32 sets of submarine storage batteriesto be supplied to Russian specifications, which were only received as late as mid-January, 13 sets had been shipped by the 30th June. The request for 150 Asdicsets (as required) has been reduced to 100 sets; there has been some confusionover the supply of these sets and their various parts, but the difficulties havebeen overcome; 43 complete sets and parts of 12 other sets are outstanding.Spares for Protocol Supplies.33. To obtain the maximum efficiency from the weapons sent to theU.S.S.R., a supply of spare parts adequate by Russian standards and an apprecia-tion of Russian methods of maintenance are essential. It is now clear that at moscow in September, 1941, there was lacking the realisation that a supply of spares for aircraft, tanks, carriers, weapons and lorries in Russia on the BritishField Force (Overseas) scale would prove inadequate. This was mainly due tothe Russians not being forthcoming in allowing No. 30 Military Mission to studytheir system of maintenance in the field. This system seems to rely upon the replacement of complete assemblies, whilst our own scales are based on the supplyof a &quot; float&apos;&apos; to complete assemblies, which are repaired by the exchange ofcomponents and put into circulation again as early as possible.The Russian system involves a supply of a very high percentage of completeassemblies, e.g., 60 per cent, gear boxes compared with our own scale of 20 percent. Since the adoption of the Russian system would have seriously reduced the output of complete tanks, for that reason it was not possible to comply incertain cases with their requirements.34. A compromise has been reached, after a series of meetings with theSoviet Military Mission and Trade Delegation, covering spares for tanks, carriers,tank armament and mechanical transport vehicles; but it was not possible tomeet in full the Russian request for certain assemblies, and delay is necessary insupplying other parts of the request.35. In an endeavour to make available for aircraft supplied up to the endof February the very large number of additional spares required to accord withthe Russian scale of provision, Lord Beaverbrook instituted a special investigation,as a result of which the position was very materially improved.* To meet thefull demand for spares for Hurricane aircraft it was necessary during April tobreak down 92 Hurricanes. A new scale proposed by the Russians, which will cover any Hurricane aircraft shipped from June onwards, has now beenapproved.t But this scale cannot be applied retrospectively to aircraft shippedduring March, April and May, except at the expense of the production of completeaircraft and engines, t. The new scale will, however, go a long way towards meeting the Russian requests.* A.S.E. (42) 5th Meeting, Minute 4.f A.S.E. (42) 15th Meeting, Minute 5.$ A.S.E.

Extra-Protocol Promises.36. Full details are given in Table C. A steady stream of requests for naval and Army equipment has been met; the Air material list is smaller. Afew requests (field artillery tractors, motor-cycle combinations, large rubber boats and Lysander aircraft) have been refused, and the quantities and type asked forcannot always be supplied, e.g., an initial promise of 50 G.L. II sets was followedby a request to the C.I.G.S. for a further 850 sets, of which 250 could with difficulty be sent.37.   The principal items promised are : (a) Army. Slave battery carriers for tank units; radio and other signalequipment, including 300 G.L. Mk. II sets; 1^ million G.S.respirators, with a large quantity of chemical warfare material;cordite, of which over 6,000 tons has been shipped since March.(b) Naval. 3 motor mine-sweepers; 3 launches; guns; mines; mine-sweepingand anti-submarine gear; 6 R.D.F. sets for destroyers.(c) Air. 16 bombsights; 1,000 tons tetra-ethyl lead; 150 mobile floodlights;50 sets bullet-proof windscreens; meteorological equipment andperspex.D. Non-Military Supplies.Raw Materials.38. When the Moscow Conference opened, a substantial flow of rawmaterials was already reaching Russia from United Kingdom and Empire sources,in accordance with a general request made through His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Moscow on the 29th June, 1941. Rubber and tin were being shipped from malaya and lead and wool from Australasia. In September, 1941, 10,000 tons of rubber and 5,000 tons of aluminium were despatched from the United kingdom in response to urgent Russian requests. By early September, however, proposalsfor monthly quotas were communicated to the Russians, and these, with fewalterations, became our raw material commitments under the Moscow Protocol.39. Fulfilment of the Protocol Commitments. The supply of raw materialsagainst the promises made at Moscow may be divided broadly into three phases : (a) The period prior to the entry of Japan into the war (October-November,1941).(b) The period immediately succeeding the entry of Japan into the war(December, 1941-February, 1942), during which arrangements for supplies from the Far East were made on a day-to-day basis.(c) The period between the establishment of the Combined Raw Materials. Board (February, 1942) and the end of June, 1942.40. The increased assistance in shipping which was given to Russia afterthe Conference made it possible to aim at a more precise fulfilment of monthlyquotas. British and American-controlled tonnage was used for the transportof raw materials from North America; that is to say, aluminium, copper, zinc,ferro-silicon and ferro-chrome. These supplies went forward at a satisfactoryrate during this period.41. The Soviet Government were informed that, as a general rule, they mustthemselves find tonnage for supplies from the Far East. Apart from thedifficulty of finding additional British tonnage in this area, British ships&apos;were,even before the entry of Japan into the war, not allowed to proceed north of hong Kong. In October-November, therefore, supplies of lead and wool fromAustralasia, and of rubber and tin from Malaya, were carried by Russianshipping to Vladivostok. Russian ships also lifted lead from Rangoon, jute from india and graphite from Ceylon, all for the Persian Gulf, with limitedassistance from British-controlled snipping. These arrangements were generally satisfactory until the entry of Japan into the war in December.; .42. The difficulties of shipping to Soviet Far Eastern ports resulted in the diversion to the Persian Gulf of materials which had previously been shippednorthwards from the sources of supply. Some Russian ships were withdrawn,and the rest were for a time largely concentrated on tin and rubber. Thus,although supplies were at all times available, it is from this period that the
failure of the Russians to lift jute, lead and wool begins to be noticeable. TheSoviet Trade Delegation themselves asked that no jute should be bought during january and February.Rubber and tin consignments earmarked for Russia tended to becomeabsorbed in the general evacuation of these commodities from Malaya. As not all consignments were recovered at transhipment ports, increased shipments fromthe Netherlands East Indies were planned by agreement with the Netherlandsauthorities to the extent necessary to complete the December and January quotas.Before these shipments were complete, however, this source, too, was denied to us.43. Shipments of metals from North America continued at a satisfactoryrate during this phase. In the case of aluminium the Soviet Trade Delegationpressed for early delivery and, partly in response to this pressure, partly as a gesture of compensation for the inevitable slowing down of supplies of other materials from the Far East, shipments of this metal were greatly acceleratedduring January and February. This was achieved by shipments from theUnited Kingdom as well as by a speeding of supplies from Canada, with theresult that by.April the entire Protocol commitment for aluminium had beenmade available. .44. Some of the goods, particularly rubber and tin, which were goingforward to Russia came technically within the category of raw materials in short supply, to which immediate attention of the Combined Raw Materials board was given. The Soviet Ambassador was asked, first by Lord Beaverbrook, andsubsequently by the Minister of Production, to furnish for rubber, tin and nickelfigures of stocks and requirements, and information regarding the measures of economy, conservation and substitution which were being applied by hisGovernment^45. The loss of territories Lc the Far East and the .decrease of Soviettonnage in that area continued to prevent regular shipment at the full rate ofmaterials from that area; but the only cases in which the supply of quotas wasin practice made dependent on allocation by the Combined Raw MaterialsBoard and that in turn on the information requested of the soviet ambassador were those of tin and rubber. M. &quot;Maisky eventually providedlimited information about stocks, production and consumption; this was accepted in London as justifying the requests which had been made and accepted in full at the Moscow Conference; that is to say, 1,500 tons of tin and 6,000 tonsof rubber monthly. Nevertheless, the Combined Raw Materials Board could notallot this full amount after March, and the resulting arrangements made at theinstigation of the Board may be summarised as follows : Rubber.(a) January quota.A deficit of about 2,650 tons, which it. had been arranged to ship fromthe Netherlands East India, but which had not been lifted when the islandswere occupied by the Japanese, was cancelled, and the Russians were informed that this deficit could not be made good.(b) February and March quotas.These were made good, up to the full 6,000 tons monthly, from Ceylon.(c) April, May and June quotas.These were revised to 2,000 tons monthly, also from Ceylon.Shipment in accordance with these arrangements was completed in June,together with about 1,200 tons towards the July quota under the SecondProtocol..   Tin.(a) Shipments from Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies sufficed to-complete about two-thirds of the January quota. During Februaryit was decided to ship tin from United Kingdom stocks to north russia. These shipments were later formalised by the followingundertaking: that we should complete the January quota and make good February, March and April quotas at the full ,rate of 1,500 tons monthly; the quotas for May and June were revised to 1,000 tons foreach of those months. 1* A.S.E.&apos; (42) 39, paragraph 4.[24344]  . c 2
(b) Shipments under these arrangements have reached about half-way through the April quota; but, except for 800 tons required for efficientstowage, shipments were held up for a reply to the enquiry mentionedin paragraph 44. The balance for the period is loaded on, or bookedfor, the next two convoys to North Russia.46. Lack of Soviet shipping and losses in transit have prevented fullamounts of raw materials from reaching Russia; the shipment and arrival figures are given in Table B. Generally speaking, materials of small bulk show little or no deficit; shellac, for instance, has arrived in full, and more than twice theentire commitment of industrial diamonds has been despatched by air. There isa small lag on shipments of copper and zinc from North America, while several months&apos; quota of ferrosilicon and ferrochrome, though small in bulk, still awaitsshipment. This is due to the low priority assigned by the Soviet Authorities, whohave control of the loading arrangements in North America, to these metals. Butthe major deficits, as will be seen from the Table, are those for jute, lead and wool,where Russian shipping has proved inadequate to lift the available quantities.47. Transition to Second Protocol. The treatment of the outstandingbalances remains to be settled after consultation with the United states authorities. Whilst it is clearly impossible to ship the balance of jute and leadconcurrently with the supply of these goods under the Second Protocol, theExecutive take the view that the remainder of the balances might without too great difficulty be made good.48. Extra-Protocol Raw Materials. Apart from supplies of raw materialsunder the Moscow Protocol, various commodities have been supplied from time totime against separate requests. These include iridiuin. hexamine, methanol,hides, tanning materials, rape seed and sisal.Machine Tools.49. The Protocol request was for &quot; 1,200 metal cutting machine toolsmonthly from Great Britain and the United States.&quot; It was clear that consulta-tion with the United States Authorities would be necessary before any firmundertaking could be given in response to this request. The Controller-Generalof Machine Tools accordingly discussed the position during a visit to Americain the late autumn of 1941, and on his return made an offer to the Russians of2,610 machine tools from Great Britain for delivery over a period of nine month sending the 30th September, 1942* This gave a notional quota of 290 machinesper month, but it was made clear that, owing to the difficulties of agreeingspecifications and allocating productive capacity, the full quota could not bereached during the early months of the period.50. Various machine tools have been supplied or promised outside thisquota. Some of these were sent before the quota came into operation, e.g., 138French-American orders, and a shell plant consisting of 102 machines; others have been promised against special requests which were made after enough orders had been placed to complete the quota commitment. In addition, 584 of theRussian orders for machine tools which had been cancelled in September, 1939,were reinstated.51. table D shows the quantity promised in each of these categoriesand the progress which has been made in shipment. Broadly speaking, there hasbeen an acceleration in shipment since the spring of this year which gives promise of the quota commitment being discharged by October, 1942, but the replacement of the heavy losses sustained in the May and June convoys will involve a seriousdrain on our limited resources and can only be undertaken at the expense of theexisting arrangements.Cutting Tools.52. The Protocol request was for 1500,000 (say  125,000) per month of hard alloys and cutting tools.Cutting tools for use on machine tools for Russia were required to metricdimensions, and our existing small stocks to an amount of some  28,000 were collected and shipped to Russia.. It was agreed to supply a further  20,000 worth of cutting tools, which had to be specially manufactured.* A.S.E. (41) 35.
At a later stage it was indicated by the Machine Tool Control to the trade delegation that cutting tools were generally in short supply, and that they must look to the United States for the bulk of their supplies.It was, however, decided by the Executive in March, 1942,* to earmark for russian requirements approximately 4 per cent, of our total capacity in the typesrequired, which represents about  30,000 per month. Specifications have been settled for approximately this amount. Delivery was to start in two months fromthe settlement of specification, to reach the full monthly quota in four months.Specifications have been settled, and deliveries have been made to the extent ofsome  10,000.Industrial and Electrical Equipment.53. Requests for forging and press equipment, electric furnaces and variousindustrial equipment were included in the Protocol, which stated in respect ofthem that: &quot; it is assumed desirable to supply the Soviet enquiries, but there canbe no guarantee of particular types or specifications.&quot; By January, 1942, no agreement had been reached with the United States Government in regard to theproportion of this equipment which should be provided &quot;by each country; butmeanwhile the Soviet Trade Delegation were pressing for the supply of such itemsas power stations, boiler plants, locomobiles, pumps and valves from the UnitedKingdom, and the Executi\re agreed to the diversion to the U.S.S.R. of threeelectrical generating plants under manufacture for the United Kingdom and seven sets intended for use overseas. On the 16th January the Executivetauthorised the supply of electrical equipment urgently required by the Russiansup to the value of about  3 million. This was in addition to equipment valued at about  1 million, most of which was for the completion of the generating plantswhich it had been agreed to. divert to Russian use. Soon afterwards it wasdecided to supply a substantial part of a further request for industrial and electrical equipment and small engines.54. During the remainder of the period the supply of additional industrial and electrical equipment was from time to time authorised. Much of the materialauthorised under this heading was of a heavy type requiring anything up to21 months for manufacture. Shipment of the smaller items, however, began earlyin 1942 and has been continuing at a steady rate.55. The total value of items of industrial and electrical equipment which we :have promised to supply (other than items dealt with by the Machine Tool Control)is  15 million. The value of goods shipped or loaded up till the 30th June is alittle over  1 million, and of goods scheduled for delivery from works in thenext 12 months about  5^ million. These figures are rough estimates only, sincecontract prices are not yet known in all cases.Foodstuffs.56. The only definite undertaking in the Moscow Protocol to supply food-stuffs from British sources was in respect of cocoa-beans (1,500 tons monthly).The Soviet authorities themselves did not assign a high priority to supplies ofthis commodity, and during the last months of 1941 and in January, 1942, suppliesof sugar, to which a higher priority was assigned, absorbed all the availablebroken stowage. By the end of the Protocol period shipments of cocoa-beanswere just under four months in arrear and, owing to port and transportationdifficulties in West Africa, and the low priority attached to them by the Russians,it has been decided to discontinue the despatch of this commodity.57. Our obligation in respect of foodstuffs (ample supplies of which were stated in the Protocol to be available from British and American sources) wasrestricted to affording assistance in the transport from the indicated sources ofsupply. It had been agreed by the United States authorities sopn after theConference that, on shipping grounds, it would be wrong in principle to send anywheat or sugar from the United Kingdom.   As an exception to this principle it* A.S.E. (42) 7th Meeting, Minute 6.f A.S.E. (42) 2nd Meeting, Minute 3.
was, however, arranged, owing to the high priority which the Russians attached&apos;to sugar supplies, and for market reasons in connection with the purchase of the-1942 Cuban sugar crop, that as much sugar should be shipped from the UnitedKingdom up to the end of December; 1941, as could be carried in broken stowagein ships sailing with other Protocol supplies to North Russia.* A limit of25,000 tons monthly was placed on such shipments, and 54,000 tons in all were despatched under this arrangement. A proposal to send a further 21,000 tons from this country in exchange for a similar amount shipped in Soviet vessels tothe Persian Gulf was not accepted by the Soviet Government.! Further deliveries from the Netherlands East Indies and Mauritius brought the amount of sugar-provided by the United Kingdom up to a total of about 77,000 tons bv the endof June, 1942.58. Shipments of Canadian wheat and flour were made direct from north american ports to North Russia during the earlier months of the period. Inthe later months, however, some shipments of flour were made from UnitedKingdom stocks to provide building-up cargo for the economical stowage ofmilitary goods (see paragraph 13). Up to the end of June about 107,000 tons ofwheat and flour had been shipped from all Empire sources.59. During the period a number of requests were made for foodstuffs otherthan those mentioned in the Protocol. Purchases of 2,000 tons of tea from Ceylon,300 tons of Kola nuts and 100 tons of meat extract have been authorised.Meclical and Veterinary Supplies.60. The Soviet request for medical supplies, which -was addressed jointlyto the British and United States Governments, was set out in Annex 2 to the-Moscow Protocol. After the Conference it was considered by the supply authorities of the two Governments, and agreement was reached as to the-proportion which should be supplied from each country, including India. with one or two minor exceptions, the United Kingdom proportion has been fulfilled.Table F shows the quantities of the surgical instruments, medicaments and drugslisted in Annex to the Protocol which at the 30th June, 1942, the United Kingdomand India have shipped.61. The total value of these goods amounts to approximately  420,000, thecost of which has been wholly defrayed by the British Red Cross Society andother charitable organisations, in accordance with an arrangement agreed betweenthe Soviet Ambassador and the Chairman.62. In addition to the items listed in Table E, large quantities of blankets,,clothing, general hospital equipment and drugs have been supplied by the BritishRed Cross Society and other voluntary organisations, and substantial purchases ofthese goods manufactured in the United Kingdom have been made byMadame Maisky on behalf of the Soviet Red Cross, who have had large funds attheir disposal.63. Some medical supplies (ether, quinine, &amp;c.) have also been contributed by the Dominions, but these consignments did not, so far as is known, include anyof the items asked for at the Moscow Conference.64. An offer of veterinary supplies made by the R.S.P.C.A. was gratefullyaccepted by the Soviet Government, and goods to the total value of  12,000 havebeen despatched.E.-Financial Arrangements.65. Military goods have been supplied on a Lease-Lend basis and are-covered by an Agreement which was signed in Moscow on the 28th June, 19424Non-Military Supplies.66.   Payment for non-military supplies has continued to be governed bythe Financial Agreement of the 16th August, 1941.g  A credit of  10 million was-originally granted, and on the 26th May, 1942, a further credit of  25 million was offered to the Soviet Government and accepted by them.H* A.S.E. (41) 2nd Meeting, Minute 7. t A.S.E. (41) 6th Meeting, Minute 2..% Appendix 2. g Appendix 3. II Appendix 4.
67. The following figures (which relate only to non-military supplies) are-of interest: Estimated total value of shipments up to the &amp;30th June, 1942        ............     28,500,000Invoiced to the Soviet Authorities by the U.K.C.C. 23,700,000Paid by U.S.S.R................    22,645,000Canadian Wheat and Flour.68. Special considerations have applied to this commodity. We stipulatedfor supply under the Agency Clause of the Financial Agreement of the16th August, 1941, which would have involved payment of Canadian dollars bythe Soviet Authorities. The Russians asked that payment should be made through the No. 1 account. This issue will be solved by the retrospective applica-tion of the terms of the projected Loan Agreement between Canada and theU.S.S.R..Freight Rates.69. Negotiations on the method of charging freight for cargoes to and fromRussia in British and Soviet ships have continued throughout most of the protocol period. An agreement on this question was eventually embodied in amemorandum and exchange of notes which took place at Kuibyshev on the22nd June, 1942**      F. Replacement of Losses.70.   During the early months of the Protocol period, losses in transit, both-of military and non-military supplies, were insignificant.   During the winter afew consignments of raw materials were lost by enemy action in&apos;the Far East,while from the spring of 1942 onwards losses of military and other cargoes in convoy for North Russia became increasingly heavy.71. The principle has been maintained throughout that our undertakings tosupply were given in such a form, both in the Protocol and in subsequent offers,as not to involve any obligation to replace material lost in transit. From this principle the practice followed of only considering replacement on receipt of a request from the Russians. At the end of 1941 the Executive decided t that anyRussian request for replacement should be considered in the light of the prevailing supply position and of the urgency of the Russian requirement, andthat in any case where it was agreed to make good the losses it should be-stipulated that His MJajesty&apos;s Government were not thereby committed to make good similar losses in the future. In April, 1942, t. it was further decided thatminor items of military or civil equipment might be replaced on request, subjectto the approval of the Service and Supply Department concerned. Replacementsof major items or of bulk raw materials were, however, reserved for specificdecisions by the Executive.72. Replacements have been authorised for a number of comparatively minoritems of civil equipment and for spare parts of military supplies. No replace-ment has been authorised for major military items, but some minor ones are underconsideration. In the case of raw materials, the Combined Raw Materials Boardhas agreed to takes losses into account when it comes to make its periodical reviewof the materials in question.G. Return Cargoes.  .73.   The Soviet Government had agreed during the summer of 1941 to&apos; supply various commodities for shipment to the United Kingdom.   Our require-ments, which were entirely of raw materials, were discussed at the moscow conference (B.A.R. (41) 10), and were listed in Annex 3 to the Protocol.   Some-of the requests were definitely accepted at the Conference; and the remainder were answered at intervals during the early months of the Protocol period.  Some^additional supplies have been requested from time to time.* Appendix 5.f A.S.E. (41) 6th Meeting, Minute 7.%- A.S.E. (42) 10th Meeting, Minute 6.
74. The main factor determining our requests to the Soviet Governmentwas the desire to make use of shipping space in the returning convoys for the carriage of supplies for the relief of the United Kingdom Import Programme.We had, however, to take into account the availability of cargoes at Soviet ports in the light of internal transport conditions in Russia. Thus timber which was available in the Archangel area was shipped in some quantity while Archangelwas open, but while Murmansk alone was being used as a convoy port someconsignments of&apos; apatite concentrates were obtained. In the earlier monthsconsiderable quantities of chrome and magnesite, which must have involved fairlylong rail hauls inside Russia, were coming forward; later, supplies of chromewere diverted to the United States.75. Great difficulty was experienced in obtaining return cargoes from north russia under winter conditions. Moreover, convoy arrangements often did not admit of vessels waiting long enough to collect cargo which might otherwise havebeen loaded. In these circumstances the Soviet Government were not pressed for regular quotas of the supplies which they had promised to make available,but they were asked from time to time to ensure that as great a bulk of goodsas possible should be offered for shipment. In January, 1942, Sir Stafford Crippswas handed a list of goods which the Soviet Government undertook to make available by the end of March. It soon became evident that this undertakingcould not be fulfilled, and on the 14th February Lord Beaverbrook wrote to theSoviet Ambassador* asking him to raise the question with his Government.M. Maisky sent a reassuring reply, but many of the commodities promised by theend of .March did not in fact come forward by that date. During the spring of1942 little pressure was applied to the Soviet Government bn this matter, owingto the doubtful position of convoys to North Russia. However, on the10th June, 1942, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs wrote to M. Maiskytstressing the importance to Allied shipping of return convoys being as fullyloaded&apos; as possible. This letter enclosed a Schedule setting out the variouspromises and the balances due against them; the Schedule also set out our requirements for the remainder of 1942. No reply has yet been received to this letter, but some progress has been made to secure promises of specific commoditiesthrough His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Kuibyshev.76. Apart from cargoes shipped from North Russia a few goods of smallbulk have been sent by air, e.g., platinum and koksagyz seed. Bitumen has been supplied for use in the development of transport in Persia, and supplies ofsleepers have been promised for the same purpose. A statement is attached(Table F), which shows the position as at the 30th June, 1942, of the shipment of return cargoes.* A.S.E. (42) 46.f A..S.E. (42) 140.

PART IV-APPENDICES.APPENDIX I.Note on Administrative Machinery.   (See Part II, paragraph 7.)Composition of the Executive.1. The Allied Supplies Executive was constituted by a directive issued bythe Prime Minister on the 15th October, 1941 (W.P. (G) (41) 111), which set out its terms of reference and composition. The Executive took over the functionspreviously performed by Lord Hankey&apos;s Committee on the Co-Ordination ofAllied Supplies. The Minister of Supply (Lord Beaverbrook) was appointed chairman, and at his invitation the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(Mr. Eden) and the Secretary of State for Air (Sir Archibald Sinclair) joined the Executive, in addition to the Secretary of State for War (Captain Margesson)and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of War Transport (ColonelLlewellin). Meetings have been attended by the Minister of Food or his representative and by representatives of the Board of Admiralty as occasionarose.2. At the first meeting held on the 29th October, 1941 Colonel Llewellinwas invited to act as Deputy Chairman. He took the chair at meetings of theExecutive during Lord Beaverbrook&apos;s absence in the United States in December,1941, and January, 1942. When Lord Beaverbrook became Minister of Production,the Minister of Supply (Sir Andrew Duncan) and, the Minister of War Transport(Lord Leathers) joined the Executive, Colonel Llewellin retaining his membershipon becoming in turn President of the Board of Trade and Minister of aircraft production. . When Lord Beaverbrook left the Government, on the 19th February,1942, the Foreign Secretary was asked by the Prime Minister to assume thechairmanship. The Minister of Production (Mr. Oliver Lyttelton) then succeededColonel Llewellin as Deputy Chairman. At the same time, Sir James Grigg had.become a member as Secretary of State for War, in place of Captain (nowViscount) Margesson.Sub-Committees and Arrangement of Business.3. While Lord Beaverbrook was Chairman the Executive appointed no formal Sub-Committees, but it had been the practice for the Deputy Chairmanto summon ad hoc meetings of Ministers and officials (including representativesof the U.K.C.C.) for the settlement of detailed transportation and supplyquestions, and for the discussion of such matters with the members of the soviet military Mission. -  -4. One result of these discussions was the establishment of an Anglo-SovietShipping Committee under the Chairmanship of Mr. F. A. Griffiths, of theMinistry of War Transport. This body continues to meet frequently in theMinistry and comprises, on the Russian side, members of the Soviet &quot;military mission, the Soviet Trade Delegation and the Anglo-Soviet Shipping Company.5. On 11th May, 1942,* the Executive set up a Sub-Committee of officials on transport and supply questions connected with Russia. The Minister of works and Buildings (Lord Portal), as Chairman of the Transportation Sub-Committee,submitted his first Report on 12th June.tSecretariat and Channels of Communication.6. A branch of the War Cabinet Secretariat was formed to promoteco-ordination of departmental action on matters handled by the Executive. ThisSecretariat absorbed the administrative section of the Ministry of economic warfare, which had hitherto handled Russian non-military supplies in correspondence with His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Kuibyshev. Colonel E. I. C.Jacob was attached to the Executive as representative of the Minister of Defence.* A.S.E. (42) llth Meeting, Minute 9.f A.S.E. (42) 13th Meeting, Minute 4.
7. It was decided at the first meeting that communications with the SovietGovernment should normally be conducted through the Soviet Ambassador inLondon, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in the U.S.S.R. being kept continuouslyinformed of the position. This procedure has been followed, with few exceptions,and has worked well.8.   On 11th February I it was decided (a) To notify the Soviet Ambassador that all requests for supplies military or- civil outside the Protocol should be addressed to the Secretariat;(6) That all requests received direct by Departments should be so referred;and(c) That manufacturers should be discouraged from entertaining directenquiries fiom the Soviet authorities.9. On 12th June, 1942,$ it was agreed that Russian requests for military supplies outside the Moscow Protocol or its Washington counterpart should beaddressed to Brigadier R. C. Firebrace, Head of the Russian Liaison Group at theWar Office, rather than to the Secretary. These requests would then be referred by Brigadier Firebrace to the appropriate Service Sub-Committee of the LondonMunitions Assignment Board. This arrangement took the place of a proposalapproved on 20th February, H that requests for Military supplies should bereferred to the London Munitions Assignment Board, since it had been found by experience that this procedure would hot be practicable.10. From the beginning the U.K.C.C. was charged with the actual executionof the programme of non-military supplies. In this connection, the closestliaison has been maintained between the Secretariat and the U.K.C.C. Theformer took up any questions of policy or dealt with other difficulties not capableof solution on a commercial basis between the U.K.C.C. and the Soviet trade delegation, London.Supplies of controlled materials have been made available to the U.K.C.C.by the Ministry of Supply, Ministry of Food and other appropriate departments for whom the Corporation acted as agents. Non-controlled supplies have beenbought on the open market by the Corporation.The shipment of all goods, except those from North America, has been effected by the War Office, Ministry of War Transport and the U.K.C.C. working in closest collaboration.Supply Section- of His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Kuibyshev.11. Proposals for the establishment of a Supply Section of the british embassy at Kuibyshev had been put forward by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador(Sir Stafford Cripps) early in 1942 and were considered at an inter-departmentalmeeting held on 3rd April, 1942, under the chairmanship of Sir Edward Bridges.The recommendations of the meetingH were reported to the Executive on22nd April. After consultations between the Chairman and the service ministers and discussion at a Meeting of the Executive on 12th June,**attended by General Mason-Macfarlane, Sir A. Clark Kerr was instructed toreport, after discussion with the Head of the British Military Mission (Rear-admiral Miles), on the question of establishing the Section in Moscow. the ambassador replied that the present arrangement was satisfactory, and that therewould be no advantage in introducing a more ambitious system.Co-ordination with the United States.12. Close consultation between Lord Beaverbrook and Mr. Harrimanprovided for CQ,-ordination at the ministerial level of British and American ship-ments, although in one or two instances the United States administrationpreferred to use the diplomatic channel and put forward requests through mr.. Winant. At a later stage consultations took place between Lord Leathersand Mr. Harriman in connection with the co-ordination of shipments and theimprovement of the American organisation for handling Russian supplies, andthe presentation for shipment from North America of high priority goods.t A.S.E.

When discussions relating to the Second Protocol were begun, they took place between the Chairman and Mr. Hopkins and the Minister of Production andMr. Harriman in the initial stages, but were subsequently transferred to washington, where they were handled on the British side by a Russian Committeeof the Supply Council under the chairmanship of Mr. E. P. Taylor.13.
