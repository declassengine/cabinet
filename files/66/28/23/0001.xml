I. GENERAL SURVEY.1. THE past six months have brought on the munitions front a more thanordinary share, both of gains and of losses. Foremost among the gains must be counted the growing flow of United States output. At the moment it remainslittle more than a stream; by the end of this year it will be a river, and beforethe end of 1943 almost a flood though the problem of moving this output tothe theatres of war will remain very severe. Our own main problem has been to integrate our production plans with those of the United States authorities,and to adjust them to take account of the help that may be forthcoming.2. The machinery to do this has been created in the form of the combined production and Resources Board in Washington with its London counterpart.The planning, of our own production in its relation to the United States has beencentralised in the Joint War Production Staff. But it is only as United Statesproduction grows in volume that we shall reap the full benefits of this organisation. For the moment there remain a number of important munitions forwhich the combined output of the United States and ourselves falls substantiallyshort of our combined requirements. The United States, like ourselves, have had their disappointments, and these have particularly affected some of those items notably Bofors guns, rifles, armoured cars and certain types of ammunition, whichwe had hoped to receive from them.3. Our second main source of satisfaction must be that the concentration of the enemy upon other objectives has made it possible for us to completeuninterrupted the development of our industrial capacity for war. The Ministryof Aircraft Production is still engaged in building new factories; there remaincertain critical shortages of special machine tools. But in the large we may nowsay that our main planned increases of capacity are complete; and the task nowbecomes that of using them as fully as possible to create the weapons andammunition that we need. This change is well reflected in the various indicesof war production. The Ministry of Supply index of Warlike Stores, starting at100 in September-December 1939, has risen from 467 in the third and 581 inthe last quarter of 1941, to 658 in the first quarter and 759 in the second quarterof this year. The Ministry of Aircraft Production output of finished aircraft,measured by structure weight, has jumped from 278 in the third and 286 in thefourth quarter of 1941 to 325 in the first and 384 in the second quarter of thisyear.4. These are great and solid grounds for satisfaction. But we have sufferedalso losses which it would be a mistake to underrate. The closure to our shipping of the Western Pacific has gravely complicated our position in regard to certain essential raw materials. The most important of these are rubber and tin. Bystringent economies we have balanced our prospective accounts in tin. Rubbermay well prove a serious limitation on our war effort. All steps are being takento secure economy and develop substitutes; but the economies that are being forced on us must affect adversely our military effort.5. In the field of home production, though output as a whole has developedsatisfactorily, there have been certain set-backs some of them serious. the bomber programme planned last November has not gone wholly in accordancewith our hopes. Teething troubles and the normal difficulties of developing large-scale production have led to the heavy bombers falling about four weeks behind the original schedule, as approved by the Defence Committee (Supply) inDecember; this lag has now been formalised in the new programme of the1st July, and it will increase as planned during the whole of the next eighteen months, until by December 1943 there is a lag on the original programme ofabout seven weeks. The light bomber programme is already nine weeks in arrearson the original schedule, and will fall increasingly behind it, partly because ofan earlier elimination of the Blenheim. The losses of heavy and light bombersare to be partly compensated by an increase of medium bombers. Hitherto outputof these has run very closely in accord with the December schedule; from now on, the programme has been stepped up, so that by December 1943 there shouldbe an excess of 873 medium bombers over the origmally planned number. Thiswill not, however, suffice to offset the loss in bomb-carrying capacity due to the shortfall on heavy bombers and the reduction in the planned output of light bombers. The immediate loss is about 7  per cent, of the planned bomb-carrying capacity; by the end of 1943 it will still&quot;be about 6  per cent., if the most recentprogramme is fulfilled.[*4217] &apos; b 2
6. There have been disappointments also in respect of naval aircraft, whereoutput is about five weeks behind the December schedule, and in regard to theTyphoon, which is 309 behind schedule owing to difficulties with the Sabre engine.7. Among the military weapons, our main difficulties have been in regardto tanks and to certain forms of ammunition. The A. 22 re-work scheme is considerably behind schedule. The output of other types has been held up by shortage of armour-plate and other minor causes. The output of Sten gun ammunition and of one or two types of armour-piercing shot is substantially below both our needs and our earlier hopes.8. The naval programme of new construction has also fallen behind,mainly in respect of destroyers, escort vessels and smaller craft. Between July1941 and March 1942 only 38 destroyers had been completed against a forecast of 61, and the total tonnage of minelayers, anti-submarine craft and othermiscellaneous vessels was 15 per cent, below forecast. It was agreed during may to give a higher priority and an increased allocation to naval work, and therehas been a perceptible improvement without serious effects on other departments.9. These difficulties and deficiencies must be set in their proper perspectiveagainst the notable increases in our total output indicated in paragraph 3. too much importance must not be attached to the events of one or two months. it remains that the upward trend of June and July has been markedly less than inthe earlier months. When all allowances have been made for particular causes,the impression remains that output is hanging fire and that the inevitabledifficulties are not being surmounted as quickly and decisively as they should be.The total plan to which we are working involves an expansion between the first quarter and the last quarter of this year of about 78 per cent, in the case of aircraft production measured by structural weight and of about 50 per cent,in the case of munitions production. That would require that the output of aircraft should expand, quarter by quarter, by about 21 per cent, and the outputof warlike stores by about 14^ per cent. The increase of the second quarterover the first quarter was 18 per cent, in the case of aircraft and 15^ per cent,in the case of the warlike stores. The increases of individual recent months overthe month three months earlier have been less encouraging. In both cases therehas been a progressive fall in the rate of increase, so that it is lately only about14 per cent, in the case oi a aircraft and 8 per cent, in the case of warlike stores.10. There are various reasons why output is not expanding faster.Throughout these three months there are holidays. If all wprkers were away forone week during the thirteen we might expect a loss of some 8 per cent, from thiscause. Some allowance has been made for this in the Ministry of Supplyestimates. The programmes themselves, moreover, assume a rather greaterexpansion in the later than the earlier months. Time alone will show how farthese are sufficient explanations.11. To a much greater extent these set-backs probably represent the increasing difficulties of greater effort as we approach our maximum. The limits of our expansion of man-power in the munition industries are now in sight;during the past six months we have expanded them by 360,000; we still needvery large numbers. But the reserve of labour in the non-essential industries isnow small. Above all, the coming of the Americans is beginning to exerciseprofound effects on our whole man-power position. We must expect to have to divert substantial resources possibly in the end as many as 250,000 workers toserving their needs directly or indirectly. We must expect this to have importantrepercussions upon our own output and programmes. A report on the limitslikely to be set to our production in 1943 by man-power, materials and other factors is now being completed by the Planning Group of the Joint war production Staff.12. For purposes of reference, tables and certain commentary upon them are attached. I propose to make these reviews at quarterly intervals, if my colleaguesfind them useful.   I shall be glad of their criticisms and advice.(Initialled) O. L.Office of the War Cabinet,Great George Street, Westminster,September 3, 1942.
II.-MUNITIONS PRODUCTION.A.-MILITARY EQUIPMENT.(i) General.13. The growth of output during the last year is shown in the following table.The outstanding increases during the past six months have occurred in small arms (116 per cent.) and small arms ammunition (99 per cent.). The output of guns and of Filled Ammunition increased by about 35 per cent.; armoured fighting Vehicles by 25 per cent.; Engineer and Signal Stores by 36 per cent.;Propellants and High Explosives by 27 per cent. The only decline has been inwheeled vehicles, where output is now controlled.13a. The composition of the total volume of production of the Ministry ofSupply has changed appreciably during the last year. ^ Wheeled vehicles forma less important part of the whole. Small arms and S.A.A, and filled gun andmortar ammunition have shown a great relative expansion. A.F.V.s continue to absorb about the same proportion of the total effort.Ministry of Supply Index of Production of Warlike Stores(Third Quarter, 1941, = 100).1941. 1942.SrdQr.     4th Qr. 1st Qr.     2nd Qr.Armoured Fighting Vehicles   ...      100 132 157 165Wheeled Vehicles ......      100 111 105 105Guns        ............      100 130 148 178Small Arms        .........      100 159 233 345Filled Gun and Mortar Ammuni-tion    ............      100 124 140 168Small Arms Ammunition        ...      100 135 201 269Engineer and Signal Stores     ...      100 120 135 163Propellants and High Explosives      100 127 144 162All Warlike Stores       ......      100 124 141 163(ii) Armoured Fighting Vehicles.14. The number of Tanks produced in the first quarter of 1942 increased by14 per cent, over the last quarter of 1941. The increase of only 5 per cent,between the first and second quarters of the year was disappointing, but not entirely unforeseen. It has been ascribed partly to shortage of armour plate,partly to re-work schemes. It had been planned to produce 375 new A.22sduring the second quarter and to re-work 125. In the event, 437 new A.22swere produced, but only 34 were re-worked. There was thus a shortfall on balanceof 29. The July forecasts of output during the coming six months show in total a reduction of 467 upon the forecasts made in April. The loss is mainly in respect of A.22s and Valentines. The April forecasts were made before theintroduction of the re-work scheme for the A.22 and took no account of it.Apart from the A.22, the reductions are principally due to diminished expecta-tions of components from the United States.Armoured Fighting Vehicles.

(iii) Tank Weapons.15. Tank weapons must be produced as essential parts of the tanks andother A.F.V.S coming off the production line. During the last six months therehas always been both a stock and a production of all items except the 2-inch BombThrower in excess of requirements. In the case of the 2-inch Bomb Throwerthere has been a persistent deficit. Canadian production has now begun, andthe shortage will disappear in the course of the next few weeks.Tank Weapons.

The limiting factor for all equipments is the carriage. Productiongenerally has expanded steadily by about 35 per cent, over the past six months.At the same time there have been changes in the composition of the total output.The output of 25-pdrs. has been stabilised in the second quarter of 1942 at about285 per month, a rate of output which would cover the then existing War Officerequirements. This will now be temporarily reduced to make room for the17-pdr., and subsequently reinstated to meet new additional requirements. Onthe other&quot; hand, the production of medium and heavy guns has expanded rapidly,after delays at the start.   Output has now reached its planned maximum.17. Output of Anti-Aircraft equipments has increased by about 25 per cent.,although demands for spares have slightly held back the output of the Bofors.The output of 3 - 7-inch guns now includes a higher proportion of mobile equip-ments, and this very desirable process will continue. The rapid increase in theoutput of anti-tank equipments continues, especially in the 6-pdr. equipments.By the last quarter of 1942 two out of every three equipments will carry the-pdr. or 3-inch/17-pdr. gun.Gun Equipments.

The output of small arms has shown a very substantial increase in recent months, and the supply of personal weapons is now somewhat easier than it was,
though it still gives cause for concern. The growth of output of the Sten gunhas been remarkable; production is already about half-way towards the ultimate objective which it is planned to attain by the beginning of 1943.19. The 4-2-inch mortar has been introduced during the last six months.Until it came into production the capacity was used to continue a high outputof the 3-inch mortar. 2-inch mortar production has increased slowly, but willdouble itself by the end of the year.Small Arms and Mortars.

Gun ammunition and mortar bomb filling has expanded consistentlythroughout the past 12 months, the former total increasing from 8 million roundsto 15 million rounds per quarter, and mortar bombs from 4 million rounds to10 million rounds per quarter. Gun ammunition is now approaching the ceiling of the programme; the only considerable remaining expansion is that of thespecial types of armour-piercing ammunition required for A.T. Guns. Cartridgecases have been the principal limit to increased filling of Q.F. rounds, and willcontinue to be so for some time to come, because of lack of pressing capacity.Despite increased filling, stocks of components have, on the whole, improved.21. The main features of the ammunition output during the last six months,apart from the general increase in output, have been the increase in medium and heavy artillery ammunition and 6-pdr. A.P. shot to meet requirements of thenew guns, and the expansion in output of ammunition for the special weapons,such as the Blacker Bombard, Smith Gun H.E., and UP. ammunition. Theproduction of the 2-pdr. A.P. shot is falling slightly since the 2-pdr. is now nolonger the staple anti-tank weapon. Output of A.P. type ammunition for the25-pdr., 40-mm. A.A. and 3-7-inch has increased, although there have been somedelays in introducing the A.P. shot for the last.22. Chemical shell has been charged in increasing quantities; the outputof the 25-pdr. chemical shell has been doubled in the last six months. Chemicalammunition for the new 4-2-inch Mortar commenced in April. Bofors Anti-Aircraft Ammunition output has increased by over 35 per cent, during the sixmonths; production of 3-7-inch H.E. and Shrapnel has, however, been reducedby 20 per cent, by agreement with the War Office.1

If charged at maximum rates, requirements will be completed by end of year or early in 1943.(vii) Small-Arms Ammunition.23. The output of Small-Arms Ammunition has further to go than any-other part of the Ministry of Supply&apos;s programme; it has increased by 270 percent, during the past twelve months, and will increase still further during thenext eighteen months. An Interdepartmental Committee under the Chairman-ship of Mr. E. H. Lever, representing the Minister of Production, has recom-mended measures for improving co-ordination between user, development and production interests with a view to easing production difficulties caused by changes in types, and in the proportion of different types, required by the three services.24. In any case, there remain difficulties in regard to certain types andcalibres. The very rapid increase in the production of the Sten gun has notbeen balanced by equal increase with its ammunition. Our own output, thoughgrowing rapidly, is quite inadequate to the production of guns. Revised fore-casts for the second half of 1942 are, moreover, considerably below the earlyhopes entertained. Plans have been made to develop very large capacity inCanada, and the United States will also make a substantial contribution.25. The production of Oerlikon 20-mm. H.E. ammunition has sufferedsevere checks during the last six months. Trouble was experienced withprematures on firing test and much of the output during the last quarter hadperforce to be filled with an inert filling. In June, however, the Ministry ofSupply were able to report that the trouble has been completely cleared, and production of live rounds is now proceeding satisfactorily. II.E. ammunitionis due to be replaced by H.E. Incendiary, production of which will begin inSeptember.

Altogether 11,583 aircraft were produced in the first half of 1942; of these8,338 were of operational type. This represents an increase of only 8 per cent, onthe previous six months in numbers, but of 24 per cent, in terms of structureweight. It is, however, 4-1 per cent, short of the target approved last December ;*this is equivalent to a cumulative short-fall at the end of June of two weeks*output.27. In view of the extraordinary growth of the aircraft industry, rates of expansion are more significant than absolute figures. To satisfy the current programme, output must be doubled in the twelve months from the last quarterof 1941 to the last quarter of 1942, in terms of structure weight. Actually thequarterly rate has risen by a third in half of that time; but May-July output was 17 per cent, above the preceding three months, a rate of expansioncorresponding to 87 per cent, over twelve months. In broad terms, it is now clearthat production has successfully changed gear and started upon the considerableacceleration called for by the agreed programmes, though there is little prospectof eliminating the cumulative deficit on these until &quot;late in 1943.28. There have, however, been certain set-backs; the chief of these were in heavy and light bombers. These classes are respectively four and nine weeksbehind schedule. A total of 2,782 bombers of all classes were produced in the six months&apos; period under review, a short-fall of 401 on schedule, which is 11-1per cent, of the target, in terms of bomb-carrying capacity. The Stirling sufferedmost, Blenheims were allowed to drop far behind, and the Albemarle andMosquito have been very slow getting under way. In the twelve months since last July, when the additional bomber programme was first broached. 5,073bombers have been produced, equivalent to 16,600 short tons of bomb-liftingcapacity, which is only 7% per cent, below the target agreed in December. This,however, treated the actual outputs of the earlier months as representing their contribution to the target,. i.e., the 7\ per cent, is a short-fall over seven months,in relation to a target of twelve months.29. The other serious set-backs in the period were: (a) the Typhoon, theschedule of which has been put back nearly three months as a result of serious and protracted trouble with the Sabre engine, and (5) the Mosquito fighter types,* By Defence Committee (Supply), 15th Meeting of 1941. This target was given in detail in M.A.P.&apos;s programme dated December 12, 1941. . .
which have been retarded some two months by initial production problems and themultiplicity of marks required by Air Ministry. The new F.A.A. types Firebrand, Firefly, Barracuda which were due to commence output by the middleof 1942, have all encountered serious difficulties, and substantial numbers are not expected to appear before the end of the year.(ii) A adjustments of Programmes.30. The longer-term picture presented, by the target approved last Decemberhas been radically altered by successive amendments of the Ministry of aircraft production^ programmes.. Early short-falls have been recognised and recoveredby stepping-up later output. The result is a net increase in numbers, by the endof 1943, of 3.200 aircraft, of which 1,350 are trainers. At the same time therehas been a very substantial redistribution between types, with the result thatthere is an increase of only 3^ per cent, on the agreed target in terms of structureweight. This switch-over is dominated by the decision to carry on Hurricaneoutput at nearly peak-level throughout this year and next (to provide supplies for the U.S.S.R.). This offsets a prospective reduction of 1.250 on the Typhoonand Mosquito, together with about 100 on the Meteor, and provides a net increaseof 2,542 fighter aircraft, apart from the addition of 462 sea fires to the F.A.A.programme.31. In the bomber group the Lancaster has been cut by 300, the newWarwick is set back to the extent of 500,&apos; and the current short-fall of 111 onStirlings is not made good. Of the light bombers the Blenheim is cut out earlyin 1943, reducing total deliveries by 440, and the delays in Mosquito output areformalised in a cut of 300. These reductions are partly compensated by steppingup the medium bombers, particularly Wellingtons. The addition to theprogramme of the fast Buckingham bomber comes too late to affect output in1943 materially. The net effect of these various changes is to reduce bomberoutput by 6^ per cent, in terms of bomb-carrying capacity at the end of 1943(that is, by nearly 5,000 short tons of bomb-carrying capacity), and by considerably more in the intervening period, since the cut in heavy bombers develops earlier than the expansion in mediums.32. Of other classes, Beauforts are increased by 100, a new lightreconnaissance machine, the Auster, is introduced (340 by end 1943); and. some300 of the yet untried Barracuda are replaced by Swordfish. A batch of Spitfiresare being hooked and spooled as sea fires for use on F.A.A. carriers, and everyeffort is being made to develop a folding-wing Spitfire to help to modernise thenow largely obsolescent stock and current output of Fleet Fighters.33. Aero-engine production has been very well up to programme, with the single exception of the Sabre, and the ratio of surplus engines to the total stock of aircraft has improved very substantially in the period under review. Of theother main component items, propellers and constant speed units have beenshortest in supply relatively to airframes; though the deficiency has fallen sub-stantially over the six months, it is still necessary to deliver some 200 aircrafteach month with slave units (airscrews and/or constant speed units); and about680 machines were deficient in these units in A.S.U.&apos;s at the end of June. these difficulties should be eliminated in the course of the next few months. a deficiency of turrets has almost disappeared.(iii) Spares.34. The fundamental question of spares supply has been established upona priority equal with that of aircraft, and the extent to which aircraft areimmobilised awaiting spares may be expected to decline substantially in the nearfuture.(iv) Gliders.35. A total of 557 trainer-type gliders had been delivered, by the end ofJune, another 412 being due this quarter to complete the contract. the operational &quot; shortage &quot; has just started to come out, after some delay in the initial supply of metal parts. The &quot; Hamilcar &quot; will only appear in numbers inthe last quarter of this year.
1 L(v) Bombs.36. In the six months, 88,268 short tons of filled H.E. bombs, and. 25,500short tons of incendiaries, were delivered. The approximate &quot; life-load &quot; of the bombers produced in the same period (i.e., maximum H.E. load at 1,000 milesoperational range for 13 trips) was 100,000 short tons, which affords a very roughbasis of comparison.(vi) Torpedoes and Torpedo-carrying Aircraft.37. A total of 697 torpedo-type aircraft Beaufort, Wellington, Hampden,Swordfish, Albacore were produced or converted for torpedo-dropping in the six months. The Admiralty produced 697 aircraft-type torpedoes in the sameperiod.(vii) Statistical Tables.38.

The total tonnage of vessels completed during a - quarter cannot betaken as an indication of the amount of construction in that quarter since theperiod of construction of major vessels is so long and the number so small.During the past six months 1 battleship, 2 medium cruisers, 2 light cruisers,35 destroyers and 15 submarines have been completed. The battleship to becompleted in the third quarter of 1942 is the only one in the next eighteen months and the aircraft carrier completed in the 4th quarter of 1941 was thelast for two years. On the other hand there are 2 auxiliary carriers due for completion, one in the autumn and one early in 1943, and the United states is to supply a large number of auxiliary carriers during the next 18 months,9 of which are expected by the end of 1942.40. Completions of destroyers have been higher in the past six months and will be high also in the second half of the year. On the other hand theoutput of sloops, corvettes and cutters fell from 28 in the second half of 1941to 15 in the first half of 1942, and in the next six months is only expected to amount to 10. Completions of submarines have increased from 13 in the last half of 1941 to 15 in the first half of 1942; it is expected that 22 will becompleted in the next half-year.Naval Building in United Kingdom.Numbers completed.

The present shipbuilding programme is based on a constant annual output of 1,250,000 gross tons of tanker and non-tanker shipping, or a quarterlyrate of 317,000 tons. Actual quarterly output has been fluctuating around this level during the past twelve months and the present programme provides forthe same rate of construction in the next eighteen months. The question ofthe conditions and efficiency of use of labour in the shipyards has recently been investigated by a Committee under the Chairmanship of Mr. Robert Barlow,the head of the Industrial Panel in the Office of the Minister of Production.

46. During the second half of this year the output both of armoured fighting vehicles and of small arms of the United Nations is estimated to be morethan double the output of the past six months; that of army artillery about one and three-quarters the output of the past six months; and that of anti-aircraft guns about three times the output of the past six months. The tablebrings out the large part already played by the United States, and her growingrelative importance. During the first half of the year she produced three-fifths of the combined tank output, and her contribution is estimated to rise to four-fifths in the second half. In the same period her contribution of armyartillery is estimated to rise from a little over a half to three-fifths of the combined output; and her anti-aircraft guns from two-fifths to over two-thirds.Canada is providing about a fifth of the combined output of armoured and scoutcars, and the same proportion of anti-aircraft ammunition. She is also animportant producer of ammunition for army artillery and S.A.A. The eastern group&apos;s main contribution comes in small arms ammunition, small arms, carriersand, to a lesser extent, field artillery, and ammunition. Though all areas plan asubstantial expansion in the second half of the year, the relative importance ofproduction in the United Kingdom, Canada and the Eastern Group alike willdecline, owing to the rapid growth of United States output.47. The quantity of goods assigned by the United States to the BritishGroup has already been impressive, though the amounts destined for the UnitedKingdom itself have been comparatively small. The following figures. showassignments of United States munitions (excluding all Canadian production)compared with the United Kingdom production in the four months March-June : U.S. Assignmentsto U.K. Group.

During these months a rapid increase has taken place; the value ofmunitions assigned during June was nearly half as great again as the average for the two months March and April. The increases for the principal groups were as follows : March-April(average).        May. June.Tanks (light, medium and heavy)...... 475 698 887Artillery, Anti-Tank and A.A.

The supply of munitions which has actually arrived in British theatres of war from the United States is relatively small compared with the assignmentsto the British Group. For not only is nearly three months taken up on the journeyfrom America to.the Middle East; a long interval has also been elapsing betweenthe time of assignment of the goods and their arrival at the ports in America.To reduce the lapse of time occurring between the release of goods to the BritishGroup and their arrival in British war theatres is one of our main anxieties atthe moment.50. Two facts make it clear, however,&apos; that our supplies of Americanmunitions may be expected to rise steeply during the rest of this year provided that sufficient shipping is available to lift them. First, forecasts of North American output in the second half of the year show a very big increase over production in the first half, and output has in most cases notfallen greatly below forecasts. Second, the United States is likely to producemuch more than will be needed for her own forces. There are as yet no finally agreed requirements of the United States Army, but the preliminary calculationssuggest that, if production comes up to forecasts, there will.be a very considerable
excess of tanks, field guns, A.A. guns, and anti-tank guns over the UnitedStates own requirements and her present commitments to Russia, China andLatin America; there will also be substantial surpluses of gun ammunition andof small aiTns ammunition. Under the terms of the Tank Mission Report we arehoping to receive some 7,650 tanks from the United States before the end of 1942.It is certain, however, that the combined supplies will fall short of the combinedrequirements in a number of rather important instances. There is likely to bea serious shortage of rifles, which may, however, be mitigated by the substitution of sub-machine guns; there are also likely to be less serious deficiencies of lightmachine guns, mortars, anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft guns, and possibly also of field guns and tanks. As regards ammunition, there are prospective shortages in particular types, but there is likely to be an appreciable surplus of field gunand anti-tank gun ammunition.51. The above discussion deals only with broad, categories ^it omits, forexample, 20-mm. ammunition, armoured cars, and tank landing craft, all ofwhich are likely to be critical items next Spring. Moreover, the effect of groupingitems is to cover up some of the more acute shortages as, for instance, the deficit of 80 per cent, on requirements for 9-mm. ball ammunition. But the figuresindicate sufficiently that there is danger of a waste of resources if effort is devoted to the production of surplus supplies which will add nothing to oureffective armament. It is likely that output both in 1942 and in 1943 will be morethan our combined shipping resources can transport.52. The above estimates are dependent upon the forecasts of output in thesecond half of this year. While forecasts for this country are probably not subjectto a very wide margin of error, this is less true of the United States. On theUnited States programme as a whole, apart from aircraft and certain types ofnaval craft, no very large lag behind the present forecasts is to be expected.But if output slips only one month behind present forecasts this would reducesupplies by much more than one-sixth of the forecast for the half-year. If, forexample, America loses her December output, she will lose two-thirds of the half-year&apos;s output of air-borne tanks, two-fifths of that of her armoured cars,one-third of that of Springfield rifles, and nearly a quarter of medium and lighttanks. Any lag in American output this year is of critical importance, sincesupplies not available by the end of 1942 are unlikely to reach any British theatre of war by the Spring of 1943.(ii) Aircraft.53. The combined aircraft output of the United States, the UnitedKingdom, Canada and Australia over the year July 1941-June 1942 and theestimated output in the last six months of this year is as follows : Aircraft.

As in the case of military equipment, the rapid growth of the United Statesproduction stands out. In the first half of this year she produced only one-fifthmore operational planes than the United Kingdom; but over the second sixmonths her forecast output is estimated at one and three-quarters times our own.In addition, she is to provide all the transport planes for the United Nations,and an increasing proportion of the trainers. Canada makes an important contribution to the supply of trainers and light bombers, and is scheduled toreach an output of 17 flying boats this December. So far, United States aircraft are not coming forward as well as most of the American production of military equipment. On present forecasts, combat aircraft will be 27 per cent, below the objective for 1942. In the first six months of the year, out of 3,548 combat planesallocated to us, only 2,917 had been delivered.54. The new Arnold-Towers-Portal Agreement has reduced the number ofplanes to be allocated to us, and increased the number destined for United states forces in Britain. The present agreement provides for the allocation to britain of 2,774 planes (other than naval) in the six months July-December. Thefollowing table shows for the first six months of this year the number of UnitedStates planes delivered to us in America and the corresponding United Kingdomoutput and, for the rest of the year, the allocation of United States planes to britain, and the United States and United Kingdom production programmes.Naval types are excluded throughout.

III. PRODUCTIVE RESOURCES.A. FACTORY BUILDING.55. At August, 1941, about 120,000 workers were engaged in buildingfactories and storage capacity. The number had fallen slightly by May, 1942,but the proportions in which the labour force is distributed between the mainDepartments concerned have greatly altered.Workers engaged on Building of Factories and Storage Capacity.August, 1941- May, 1942.Ministry of Supply      .........      75,000 58,000Ministry of Aircraft Production      ...      25,000 37,000Admiralty          ............      10,000 7,000Ministry of Food and other departments      10,000 12,000Total      ...     120,000 114,00056. A year ago the main emphasis of our factory construction was uponthe completion of the Royal Ordnance Filling and Cordite Factories, and thecompletion of some of the Engineering R.O.F.&apos;s. At August. 1941, nearly 46,000men were engaged in building them. By May, 1942, that figure had fallen to23,000 and this should be further substantially reduced during the next threemonths.57. As was foreseen last autumn, the labour that has been saved fromthis has largely been absorbed for the moment in building the new factoriesrequired for the expansion of our aircraft programme. The employment oflabour by the Ministry of Aircraft Production has increased steadily duringthe past few months. It. is likely to increase to about 45,000-50,000 duringthe present summer and thereafter decline until it reaches a figure of some40,000 at the end of the year.58. The end of the period of construction, already almost reached in thecase of the main factories of the Ministry of Supply, marks an importantstage in the development of our war effort. Since the outbreak of war we have completed somewhere about 150 million square feet of factory space, and haveadded, probably, about 7^ per cent, to the total in the country at the beginningof the war. Hitherto the main limit on our output has been that of capacity;that limit is now rapidly disappearing.B.-MACHINE TOOLS.59. After factory space, the main factor determining the - rate of expansion of our munitions output has been the supply of machine tools. Thedecisions greatly to enlarge the supply of certain armaments, and especiallyaircraft, have resulted in requirements for certain types of machines beyondthe immediate capacity of this country or America to provide, thus resulting in shortages of what are known as critical tools.60; At November 1940, we had about 770,000 machine tools in thiscountry. Between then and the end of June 1942 we have added about 170,000.During the course of 1942 the numbers engaged in making machine tools and small tools were increased from 62,000 to 99,000, by the addition of 24,000 menand 13,000 women; the percentage of women employed at the end of the year was about 15 per cent, in the making of machine&quot; tools and 23 per cent, incase of small tools. The output of the industry during the last six months isshown below:[24217] D 2

At the beginning of the year the estimated demand for machine toolsfor the year as a whole amounted to 103.906.   It was composed as follows :Ministry of Supply......       ... ...      29,620Ministry of Aircraft ProductionAdmiraltyEastern Group, &amp;c.RussiaAssisted schemesIndependent demands32,9282,4002,0003,2003 75830,000103,906The Assisted Schemes are in respect of machines wanted for the expansion of machine-tool production, or for the production of jigs, tools or fixtures. TheIndependent Demands are received direct from contractors, usually for purchase by them. All requirements are investigated by.the Machine Tool Control, whoexamine the utilisation of any existing machines, and the necessity for thefurther machines required.62. The prospective supply during 1942, as foreseen at January, was about85,000 machines from British makers, leaving a deficit of about 18,000 machinesto be covered, so far as possible, by imports from the United States.63. During subsequent months considerable additional requirements were put forward for early delivery, and it wras clear that the capacity of the industry could not meet the delivery times which were being stated. The position at theend of June was that, since the beginning of the year, total stated requirementshad reached 121,411 machines. Against these, 54,852 had been installed by united Kingdom users, leaving 66,559 still outstanding. To meet these require-ments we may hope to produce 50,000 from British sources in the second half ofthe year, and, if imports continue at the rate of the first six months, to supplyabout 13,000 from United States sources.64. The output of the industry is constantly under review and orders for particular types of tools are distributed between manufacturers so as to securethe greatest possible economies of manufacture. The position differs greatly inrespect of different types of tools. The general purpose machine tools, ordinarilyproduced in this country, present no very serious problem of production, thoughthe large requirements of the Ministry of Aircraft Production concentrated intoa short period of time demand a rate of output considerably greater than thatof recent months.65. The principal difficulties concern a limited number of criticalspecialised machine tools. Some of these are produced in this country, but formany of them we must rely on the United States. Urgent requirements are inthe main in respect of these tools met by diversion from less critical needs. Thesupply of those for which we depend on the United States is much more difficultto arrange, and is increasingly dependent on our making full effective use of thosewe already have.66. In these circumstances it is specially necessary to secure that all available tools are used as fully as possible.   The Machine Tool Control is com-
completing a census of all critical machine tools and the extent to which they arenow worked. All. possible steps will be taken to secure that such tools areoperated as continuously as is practicable, and at least on a full double shift. Theattention of all principal contractors has been drawn to the importance ofsecuring the best use of tools by the extension of the &apos;&apos; grouping &apos;&apos; system amongfirms manufacturing the same product, the carrying out of work by one firm for another, or by adopting a &quot; rota &quot; scheme for the manning of plant.C. RAW MATERIALS.(a) IMPORTS.(i) Imports: January-June.67. During the first six months of 1942 we brought in 46 per cent, of theprogramme of 12-2 million tons of raw materials submitted to the lord presidents Committee in January; in the corresponding six months of 1941 webrought in 49 per cent, of the year&apos;s imports. The actual imports are shown indetail in Table I.(ii) Imports ahead of Programme.68. Imports in excess of programme include iron ore, pig iron, chrome ore and manganese ore; hardwoods, sleepers and crossings; lead; wood pulp andnewsprint; cotton, wool and hemp; hides and skins; crude rubber (of whichimports during the six months were just about equal to consumption). The largeimports of wool have been due to the large amount of shipping space availablein Australasia as the result of the strategic disposition of shipping.(iii) Imports short of Programme.69. The most conspicuous deficits are in steel, ferro-alloys and magnesite;softwoods; all non-ferrous metals except lead and copper; certain paper-making materials and materials for sulphuric acid and fertilisers. In 1941 the first sixmonths of the year saw 48-6 per cent, of the year&apos;s total imports of the iron andsteel group and 51 - 9 per cent, of the year&apos;s softwood imports. This year we have only brought in 44 per cent, of our year&apos;s programme of iron and steel and 38 percent, of our programme of timber during the corresponding period. During the six months, however, the Ministry of Food received more than its agreed shareof imports, and the consequent increases in the second six months may serve to correct the balance.(b) STOCKS.(i) Change in Total Stocks.70. Our stocks of raw materials (omitting home-produced iron ore, of whichnormal working stocks are ordinarily maintained) are estimated to have declinedduring the first six months of 1942 by 1,253,000 tons; this is equivalent to about14 per cent, of end-1941 stocks. ,The present rate of de-stocking, if continued tothe end of June 1943, would leave us with remaining stocks a little less than half-way between those now existing- and those which may be regarded as an absolute minimum.(ii) Changes in Individual Stocks.71. The decline in stocks has been heaviest in timber and materials forfertilisers (the latter partly on seasonal grounds). Stocks of non-ferrous metalson balance remained almost constant over the six months. Stocks of textilematerials rose appreciably. The detailed changes in stocks are shown in Table II.72. If comparison is made between present stocks (measured in weeks)given in Column 3 of that Table and the minimum stocks given in Column 4, itwill be seen that stocks are not more than four weeks above what is regarded as aminimum for the following imported materials : Iron Ore. Softwoods.Manganese Ore. Hardwoods.Copper. Constructional Plywood.
73. There are still substantial stocks of the following materials, though mseveral cases there are serious difficulties of supply : Chrome Ore. Cotton.Tin Ore. Wool.Zinc Concentrates. Flax.Sulphur and Pyrites. Jute.Newsprint. Rubber.Imports of most of the above were ahead of programme in the periodJanuary-June.(c) INDIVIDUAL MATERIALS.(i) Iron and Steel.74. In the first three months of the year we were running down our stocksof pig-iron; this was mainly the result of a decline in pig-iron imports. SinceApril an improvement in home production has prevented a further fall and hasrestored the original stock.75. Stocks of steel (excluding those held by consumers) fell during the sixmonths by 350,000 tons. This is at an appreciably lower rate than the declineover the year of 1 million tons that was assumed for purposes of the 12 - 2-million-ton programme. The smaller decline is partly to be explained by a slightimprovement of home production, especially of alloy steels; more of the difference is due to a total run-out below the total of departmental allocations.76. Total steel allocations for the third quarter of the year amount to2.887,000 tons. This is an increase of 80,000 tons over the initial allocations andof 24,000 tons over the final allocations for the second quarter. The share of theSupply and-Service Departments in the total allocation has increased steadilyeach quarter since the beginning of 1941. &apos; At that time they were getting about64 per cent, of all steel; they are now getting about 76 per cent. A very large part of the remaining 24 per cent, goes also indirectly to serve their needs.(ii) Copper.77. Stocks in the United Kingdom at the end of June represented aboutfifteen weeks&apos; consumption at the rates forecast for the next quarter; this isclose to the necessary minimum. Consumption is for the moment below thatforecast earlier in the year. Some 20 per cent, of our imports in the first sixmonths came from the United States, and our prospective supplies must depend to a considerable extent on what the United States can let us have. their consumption is increasing rapidly and their present stock position, though notaccurately knoWn, is certainly weak; thus they may be unable fully to meet our needs. The position is being constantly watched; the possibilities of savingcopper by substituting other metals and by curtailing any unnecessary building of ammunition stocks are being carefully considered.(iii) Tin.78. End-June stocks of metal were about 17,300 tons, and of ore (in termsof metal) 8,200 tons. United Kingdom consumption of metal is about 1,800 tonsa month, and we are planning to supply Russia at the rate of 750 tons a month.Thus, if the supplies to Russia are maintained, we have stocks equal to about ten months&apos; consumption. British consumption of metal has been cut to about two-thirds of the rate at the beginning of this year, and the objective is toreduce it as soon as possible to a half. During the last three months, importsof ore and concentrates, mainly from Bolivia and Nigeria, have about balancedour consumption and export of finished metal. Steps are being taken to increase output of ore in Nigeria, and in Cornwall, where it has now reached about400 tons metal content a month.(iv) Rubber.79. Stocks of crude rubber at the beginning of this year amounted to about97,000 tons. During the last six months we have imported about 57,000 tons andhave consumed about the same amount. It may be possible to reduce consumption in the second half of the year to 25,000 tons \ quarter or less, but any further
&apos;S6cut must affect requirements essential .to the war effort (for comparison, ourconsumption in the last quarter of 1941 was 44,000 tons). It must, however, beremembered that rubber fabricated in America meets a large proportion of our needs. The problem is being actively considered on both sides of the Atlantic;a committee under Lord Moyne &quot;has &quot;already reported on our own position; weare awaiting a report from&quot;the C.P.E.B. at Washington. For the moment,utilisation is proceeding at about 25,000 tons a quarter, in order not to interruptthe production of essential weapons. It would be necessary to limit our con-sumption in subsequent quarters to about 17,000 tons if we are to get through1943 with a small margin to spare. There can be no question that the difficultiesof rubber supplies are likely to prove a more serious limitation to our war effortthan any other difficulties of raw materials that we have yet encountered.(v) Timber.80. In the case both of hardwoods and of softwoods there are increasing-difficulties in satisfying absolutely essential war requirements. The stock ofsoftwoods was 467,000 standards at the end of 1941; it had fallen to 276,000standards by the end of June. Departmental allocations have been severely cut,but the allowances for &apos;&apos; Bolero &apos;&apos; and other emergencies have largely offset any&apos;consequential economies. Arrangements have been made for heavy loadings ofsoftwoods in August and September.(vi) Textile Materials.81. Stocks of cotton and of jute have been very substantially increased during the last six months. The large imports of cotton have mainly resulted from good liftings from Egypt, the Sudan and India, made possible by the availability of tonnage from these areas due to the strategic disposition ofshipping. Cotton stocks now represent about 37 weeks&apos; consumption and jute32 weeks&apos; consumption. The shortage of American cotton which prevailed forsome weeks has now been remedied. We now have between one.and two years&apos;stocks of the types of Egyptian cotton that are most essential to the war effort,and steps are being taken to conserve these stocks. Wool stocks, though reducedabout 20,000 tons over the period, are equivalent to 46 weeks&apos; consumption. the relatively high level of stocks is partly the consequence of the severe restrictionsthat have been imposed upon civil consumption; in the case of cotton it is partly due also to shortage of labour in the spinning section of the industry; presentproduction of yarn is below the programme. The closure of the Bay of Bengaltemporarily limited our imports of jute to the quantities which could be railedacross India. Jute and jute goods are, however, now again being shipped fromCalcutta in good quantities. Preparations are being made to substitute cottonfor jute if necessary, mainly in the United States.\d) THE GENERAL RAW MATERIALS POSITION.82. Of the three fundamental limitations on the scale of our productiveeffort materials, man-power and capacity that of man-power remains the mostacute, despite the serious losses that we have suffered during recent months inrespect of materials. These losses are likely to be most serious in regard to rubber,and are forcing us to revise all our plans so as to economise to the utmost. Thedifficulties of tin supplies have largely been met by severe restrictions on consump-tion in less essential uses; it is not to be expected that shortages of tin will have any serious or immediate effect on the war effort. The supplies of copper are difficult, but they are not likely to prove insurmountable; the difficulties here ariselargely from the greatly increased demands of the United States. The essential supplies of iron and steel are for the moment being effectively maintained, butat the cost of running down our stocks; of the total output an increasing shareis going to the Supply Departments. The supplies of textile materials are forthe time being adequate.83. During the past six months we have run down our raw material stocks at a rate of about 209,000 tons a month. This rate of de-stocking will leave us with adequate, but not generous, stocks at mid-1943; to de-stock to this extentis not dangerous, provided that we can look with some assurance to increase our imports of raw materials in the second half of 1943.

The numbers in these industries engaged on work for the Supply andother Departments are estimated to have been approximately as follows : June 1941   ...December 1941June 1942  ...IncreaseAdmiralty.638,300683,000727,50089,200Ministryof Supply.979.1001,230.0001,385,400406,300M.A.P.990,4001,121.0001,265,000274.600OtherDepts.206,700243.000242,60035,900(ii) The Dilution of Skilled Labour in the munitions industries.87. With the growth of the munitions industries, it has been essential tosecure the greatest economy of the use of skilled labour. As the war progressedvery many rules and customary practices were put into cold storage. Thoughcomplete job mobility within industry does not even now exist, any difficulties that remain in diluting to the fullest extent are relatively unimportant andnormally to be overcome by agreement. It is not possible to define skill or skilledwages sufficiently accurately to obtain precisely comparable information industry by industry or from one date to another of the degree of dilution in the widestsense. It is possible, however, to&quot; measure one form of dilution, the increased useof women&apos;s labour in industries which before the war were largely staffed by men.   The following Table shows the recent changes : Percentage of Female to Total Employment of Operatives in the munitions industries.engineering and AlliedIndustries.June 1939June 1940June 1941December 1941March 1942    .June 19421416222729-330-9Chemicals,Explosives,Oils, &amp;c.20-423 04Q-747149-650-4Shipbuildingand Ship-repairing.0-40&apos;1123
It will be seen that the proportion of women has been increasing steadily sincethe outbreak of war and is now not far short of one-third in the engineering and allied industries. Pressure is still being put upon employers to extend so far aspossible their use of female labour, and in particular to make use wherever possible of the part-time work of married women.(iii) The contraction of the building industry.88. At the 1st July, 1942, the number of insured men aged 16-64 in building and civil engineering was estimated to be about 762,500. As plannedlast autumn, it had been hoped to reduce a then existing figure of about 920,000to something of the order of 600,000 by the end of the present building season.The addition of large new demands for building labour, mainly arising from&quot; Bolero,&apos;.&apos; has made it necessary both to maintain a substantially larger buildingforce than that and to postpone certain of the remaining demands of theDepartments.89. The employment of labour on new building for the various Departmentsduring the first six months of 1942 has been estimated to be as follows : (Thousands)1942 .

Since the war began we have achieved a rearrangement of the working population of this country which in peacetime would have required severaldecades. The process of transfer of personnel to the Services and from less essential to more essential work is still continuing rapidly, but the difficulties are becoming increasingly great as we approach the point where the maximumuse is being made of our resources. The limit upon our ability to expandproduction, which, until recently, was imposed by production capacity in theform of factories, machine tools and equipment, is now becoming that of man-power. The labour supply position is not dealt with in any detail in the presentsurvey, because a comprehensive manpower survey is now being made by theMinister of Labour and the results will shortly become available. The Joint War-Production Staff will also shortly present a report on the production programme for 1943, which draws attention to certain aspects of the manpower position fromthat point of view.
