THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8. GOVERNMENT *Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1942.SECRET.W.P. (42) 398.September 4, 1942.WAR CABINET.OPINION IN FRANCEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues herewith a record of a conversation between Major Morton and Monsieur Felix Gouin on the 25th August last.Monsieur Gouin was a leading Socialist Deputy before the Armistice and vice-President of the Parliamentary group of the Socialist party. He was oneof the 80 Deputies and Senators to vote against the abolition of the ThirdRepublic. He is a lawyer and defended Monsieur Blum in the Riom trial. Hewas brought to this country last month at the request of General de Gaulle.A. E.Foreign Office,September 4, 1942.ANNEX.1. M. Couin insists that we have not yet understood the morale of thenavy, army and air force in Unoccupied France. The key-note of the ArmisticeArmy is an unwillingness to fight Germans. Were there to be a successfulAllied landing in France, about 50 per cent, of the officers of the army wouldobey the orders of Petain, Laval or Darlan, which would be whatever Germanyordered. This 50 per cent, would be ready to fight the English or the Americans.The remaining 50 per cent, of the officers would be unwilling to,fight the Englishor Americans but if ordered to do so. would probably try and desert to general de Gaulle or the British or the Americans. The other ranks of the ArmisticeArmy must be looked upon as mercenaries who, though not -anxious to fightanyone, would be less likely than their officers to rebel against a Vichy orderto fight the English or Americans. M. Gouin summed it up by advising us to expect no help from the Vichy Army but rather hindrance and possiblyopposition.2. It is different with the navy. Most of the French naval officers wouldbe quite ready to fight the British or the Americans if so ordered by Vichy, butthey would neither surrender their ships to the Germans nor attack the british or American Fleets. unless ordered to do so or unless first attacked themselves.This accords with the general orders they have at present received. - As distinct from the other ranks of the army, the lower deck of the French Navy is onbad terms with its officers, is inclined to hold opposite political views, is veryanti-German and still more anti-Italian. To this extent, the lower deck maybe looked on as potentially pro-Ally.11840   [24312]Copy No.   30
&quot; 3. The Air Force allowed to Vichy in Unoccupied France (but not in theColonies) is inclined to be pro-German, having been selected with that end inview. Broadly speaking, it would be ready to attack the English or Americansif so ordered by Vichy.4. The Vichy naval, military and air forces are, however, united in theirhatred of the Italians. Could a situation be created whereby, after a successfulAllied landing in France, the Vichy Forces were ordered by Vichy to defend the &quot; neutrality &quot; of the Vichy-Italian frontier, they would all obey with alacrity.5. M. Gouin holds the lowest opinion of General Weygand, affirming thatif in any circumstances he should offer his services to the Allies, they should be firmly refused. General Weygand has no reputation left in any quarter in France.The Frenchmen who wished to continue resistance despise him. Those whosupport Vichy deride him as the man who was tricked by his &quot; friend &quot; Petain.6. During the Riom trial, M. Gouin, as advocate of M. Blum, studied a recent secret memorandum by General Weygand describing the incidents of the1940 Armistice. According to General Weygand, Reynaud, Mandel and Blumasked Weygand to remain in France and negotiate a local armistice with theGermans, while they flew to Africa as a Government to continue resistance.Weygancl states that he refused to accept even a written order to this effect.Admittedly he argued that Britain would collapse within a fortnight a mistakewhich he has since regretted but he based his refusal on the plea that it was&quot; against his personal honour &quot; to negotiate with the enemy, that sort of thing-being the duty of politicians. Moreover, he claims to have feared lest theGovernment, having re-established itself in Africa, should repudiate the ordergiven him so that his &quot; personal position &quot; would be adversely affected. M. Gouinsays that this deplorable statement is now getting known in France and hasfurther discredited Weygand.7. In describing the situation in the Vichy Colonies, M. Gouin confirmed ouropinion that the situation there differs from that in Metropolitan France. Aswe have repeatedly been told, the absence of occupation troops and the relatively high standard of living have made all but a few desire only to be let alone andto take no further part in war. As in Madagascar, the majority of the Vichytroops in any French Colony would resist the Allies. They already have their orders. They might resist the Germans, but would certainly resist them lessstrongly than the Allies. They would probably resist an Italian invasion more strongly than any other. But to resist Germans or Italians they must be ordered to do so by their recognised military chiefs. It is doubtful if such an order would be given by any of the military chiefs now in command.8. In the event of an Allied invasion of Metropolitan France M. Gouinconsiders it quite unnecessary for General de Gaulle, who has relatively no troops at his disposal, to play a part in the initial operations. On the other hand,General de Gaulle should be invited to land with a staff and guard of his owntroops in France behind the Allies as soon as their landing is clearly successful.The administration of liberated French territories, apart from those which for strategic reasons the Allies must administer as a military area, should be handedover to General de Gaulle to administer in the name of the French people.9. The working people of France, apart from the Armed Forces allowedto Vichy by the Armistice, and particularly the working people in occupied territory, will be ready to fight the Germans at the side of the Allies, if they aregiven arms. In 1939-40 it was unfortunately true that many classes in Francechose to consider the war an affair of &quot; the capitalists, the freemasons and theJews.&quot; There was no mass enthusiasm. That is now changed. They nowrealise the true issues behind this war. If the Allies tell them to join general de Gaulle, they will do so and will accept him readily as their military leader.They would even accept him as a temporary military dictator, so long as it ismade clear that a temporary military dictatorship is necessary. This can onlybe assured by the association with General de Gaulle of well-known Left Wingleaders.10, In M. Gouin&apos;s opinion, men like M. Mandel and Blum retain greatpotential political force in France. M. Blum&apos;s political stature has grown sincethe Riom trial. In the hypothetical circumstance of an Allied invasion ofFrance, M. Gouin claims that M. Blum and M. Mandel would be ready to associate themselves with General de Gaulle. Any attempt to negotiate with members ofthe present Vichy Government would lead to Civil War.
