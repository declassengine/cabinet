(i    /tow )THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERT BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  September 1942.SECRET.W;P. (42) 420.September 21, 1942.WAR CABINET.INDIA.Indian States : Request by Chamber of Princes for Statementof Policy by His Majesty&apos;s Government.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.IN W.P. (42) 391 of the 4th September, 1942, the Secretary of State forIndia has indicated the line he proposes to take in replying to the request bythe Indian Chamber of Princes for a statement of the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment towards them.2. I agree with the Secretary of State for India that it would be mostinadvisable to make a public reply, but I am concerned to note that it is not considered possible to enjoin secrecy on the Princes in regard to the reply which,is to be communicated to them privately. Both here and in America there is a widespread feeling, vague but none the less strong, that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should open some kind of unspecified negotiations with the Indian parties,and particularly with Congress. If, as is contemplated in W.P. (42) 391, it becomes known to the public that His Majesty&apos;s Government have gone some wayto meet a request by the Indian Princes for a further statement of policy on indian constitutional development, it will not be generally appreciated that the reply consists mainly of an explanation of the reasons why no new statement ofpolicy can be made; both here and in America it will be argued, with someappearance of truth, that for our own purposes we are encouraging reactionaryelements while refusing to open negotiations with representatives of the Indianpeoples. Any further explanations given should be made on the basis that theyare strictly confidential.3. As regards the contents of the suggested reply, I have two commentsto make : (i) I should very much regret any phrasing which might be construedinto a modification of the policy as regards the development of representative institutions in the Indian States which I explainedon behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the House of commons on the 28th April, 1942 (see W.P. (42) 391, paragraph 5 III). Thewords I then used were agreed to beforehand by the Secretary ofState for India. It is true that we cannot, consistently with our treaty obligations, impose democratic, constitutions on the indian states, but for their sakes as well as our own we ought to do all we can to encourage them towards democratic institutions. We are constantly stating that we are fighting for democracy which means a great deal more than administrative improvements.[24376]Copy No.
(ii) I think it would be most unwise to encourage the idea of a separateUnion of the Indian States (W.P. (42) 391, paragraph 5 IV). TheDraft Declaration does not of course deal with this point as it was concerned with British Tndia alone so far as constitutional changes are concerned. A project with so many geographical difficulties is,however, quite unreal, and surely we do not wish to create anotherPakistan problem merely to give the Indian Princes a pressuredevice against British India.4. For my own part, I should feel inclined to tell the Princes that wecannot at the present time make any fresh statement of policy as regards theIndian States.5. At the same time we should, in my opinion, pursue an active policy ofpersuasion towards the democratisation of the Indian States underconstitutional Princes.E. S.
