Of. J(THIS DOGTMSNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC UAJBSTY&apos;$ government-SvIE&apos;secret copy NO.se?.  (42) 414.l6th September 1942.&apos;.TAR CABINETHANPOYJERMemcyandura by the Minister of information fool that I must bring to the attention of the Y/ar Cabinet the serious position in which this country.&apos;s propaganda services are being placed by their inability to get the men they need reserved from military service.question :\a to the importance to this country of maintaining and indeed increasingthe power and efficiency of our broadcasting system.     The service it requires isarduous and exacting;   and those who are familiar with the work recognise that itis not possible to do it properly without employing a number of young men on thestaff.     Broadcasting on a world vd.de scale has only devdloped during the last twenty years and it is therefore natural that it should require young men of thisgeneration to service it.     Moreover, it is by nature, a highly technical and professional service and skilled men are neither easily nor quickly come by.Nevertheless, unless something is don.;, the j?,B.0. v/ork will be thrown intoa state of something like chaos in a few weeks.     The ago of reservation for their staff was raised to 35 by the Advisory Committee on Civil Service Man-Power (theKennet Committee) in October last year.     This contrasts with a reservation age of30 for persons in actual Government employment.     A recent application by theCorporation to the1 Committee for indefinite deferment of 155 members of their staff was met by a refusal in 75 cases to grant more than temporary deferment up to theend of the current month, or in a few cases up to the end of the present year.Thus, practically        of their claims have been turned down.     Not all the men inquestion are of the same degree of importance to the broadcasting system, but all arein varying degrees specialists of proved value.  -The Directors General of the B.B.C. applied to the Kennet Committee for arehearing of the cases and for the right to be heard personally on their merits.They were refused and invited merely to make a general statement.     They thensuggested that the Committee should visit the B.B.C. in person and spend anafternoon studying on the spot the actual conduct of the work, in order to informthemselves what was really involved in the operations described.     The Committeedeclined.In view, of this, I feel that there must be some failure in the KennetCoasnittee to realise the vital importance of maintaining an adequate roadefficient service for publicity and propaganda.     These activities are weapons of war, but they cannot be wielded without staff.what I w: sh to ask of the war Cabinet is that some instruction should begiven which will lead to a livelier recognition by the Kennet Committee of theessential part that the B.B.C.&apos;s propaganda and publicity services play in theconduct of the war.     In particular I should like to ask that the reservations of.B.O. staff which, under existing conditions, would run. out by the end of thismonth, may be continued until they can be reconsidered by the Kennet Committee inthe light of vrtiat.jver instruction may be given.The primary case isthat of the B.B.Ci take it that there can be noB.B.16th September 1942.
