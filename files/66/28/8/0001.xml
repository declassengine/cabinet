Army   Commander&apos;s   Personal  Memorandum  No.   1.   datedthe 15th August, 1942.Annex II. Army Commander&apos;s Personal Memorandum No. 2, dated the-19th August, 1942.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES, Secretary.Great George Street, S.W. 1.August 25, 1942. .ANNEX I.Army Commander&apos;s Personal Memorandum, No. 1.To Commander, 13th Corps, and Commander, 30th Corps, fromCommander, 8th Army.HAVING assumed command of 8th Army I consider it important thatCommanders should be quite .clear as to my policy, and should devote themselveswhole-heartedly to carrying it out.This policy is as outlined below.2.   Intention.While holding the present front securely against enemy attack, to prepare8th Army for offensive operations designed to destroy the enemy forces in Esrvotand Libya.3.   The Necessity for a Proper &quot;Atmosphere.&quot;One of the main responsibilities of any Commander, however senior orhowever junior, is to give his subordinates and troops what I call &quot;atmosphere.&quot;In 8th Army the basic foundations of the &quot; atmosphere &quot; in which we will nowlive and work will be as follows : .  ,(a) There will be no looking Eastwards over our shoulders and consideringsuitable rear lines or positions to which to withdraw. There willbe no withdrawal to any rear positions.Should the enemy attack us before our offensive plans are ready,we will fight him on the ground where we now stand.[24263] -
(b) In battle, offensive and defensive action alternate.&quot;When on the defensive all ranks must realise that good defenceswill not in themselves win the battle. If .the enemy is allowed toretain the initiative and to develop his plans, no defences, howeverstrong, will prevent him from achieving his object.Only by offensive action can the initiative be regained in the defensive battle, and without the initiative we cannot win.(c) Therefore, while holding our present front securely against enemy attack until we ourselves are ready to deal the knock-out blow, wemust be offensively minded and offensive in our actions in the air and on the ground by day and by night.(d) Confidence and enthusiasm must be&apos;radiated by all Commanders, andmust permeate right down to the rank and file.The mandate is to destroy Rommel and his army, and it willbe done and soon.4.   The Immediate Defensive Policy.It will take a few weeks of preparation and training before we can deliverthe knock-out blow. During this period we can take no risks and CorpsCommanders will take all necessary &quot;steps to ensure that our present positionswill be held intact should the enemy attack before we are ready whatever maybe the scale of attack.I have indicated to Corps Commanders my orders regarding the conductof the defensive battle should this be forced on us.I am satisfied, definitely, that our plans for dealing with an enemy attackwill defeat such attack. Confidence in this respect must permeate throughout8th Army, with the clear realisation that shortly we will deal the knock-out blow.5. The Knock-out Blow.[a) The spear-head of our offensive will be a Corps of two armoured divisions and one mobile infantry division, with a further armoured divisionavailable to maintain momentum.This Corps will be organised, and located for training, in an area to the south of El Hammam, under H.Q. 13th Corps.Having got our present front thoroughly secure, I intend to. place the whole front under 30th Corps, and to withdiaw H.Q. 13th Corpsto take command of the spear-head formations. I hope to be able to effect this change before the end of August.(6) Although the spear-head of our offensive will be a Corps composed as above, and withdrawn for special training, all formations and units in 8th Army will take part in the battle and will have a vital part to play.No one must think he is being left out. of the hunt.No one will be left out; there will be good hunting for all.Therefore all must train for the battle.6. Terminology.We British are apt to be influenced by &quot; words &quot; which are often acceptedliterally and thus affect our mentality. I give three below, and their use will be discontinued in 8th Army.Consolidate. This word is apt to produce a defensive mentality and,indeed, inaction. We are probably all clear as to its proper meaning. we will give it up and, instead, will use the word &quot; reorganise.&quot;Box. This word seems to have been applied to a defended area. Buta box is something from which it is not easy to emerge quickly, and in whichsomething is shut. This word will not be used. Instead we will use the word&quot; area.&quot; A defended area will be regarded by all ranks as a firm base fromwhich to develop offensive action at the right moment either,, by fire, or bymovement, or by a combination of the two.Battle Group.-! do not understand what this expression means. Itwill not be used. Divisions will fight as Divisions, having mobile reserves to take offensive action.A correct mentality in the above respect is all part of the &quot; atmosphere &quot; inwhich we now live.
s7. Fighting Spirit and Morale.It will be obvious that however good our plans, and our training, and ourhigher leading, we shall fail unless the troops are imbued with a good fightingspirit and have the light of battle in their eyes. Every officer and every man mustbe full of infectious optimism and offensive eagerness; there must be greatenthusiasm for the war, for the cause for which we are fighting, and for the dayof battle which is drawing near.It will be the decisive battle in the decisive theatre, and will be the turning-point of the war ; and the sooner we can win this battle the sooner the war willbe over and the sooner we can all return home.There will be no pessimists and no doubters in 8th Army.I call on all Commanders to give their personal attention to &quot;this1 vitalbattle-winning factor-the fighting spirit and morale of the troops.Enthusiasm and inspiration must be generated at the top, and must be passeddown to the rank and file.Let us carry qur tails high in the air, having complete confidence in our ability to deliver the knock-out blow.Secrecy.8. Secrecy regarding our offensive plans is vital to success. Paragraph 5of this memorandum will not be reproduced and will not be referred to in writing.The general terms of paragraph 5 may be explained verbally at conferencesdown to and including Divisional Commanders; but nothing will be issued inwriting as regards the plans for the knock-out blow outlined in paragraph 5.The immediate problem in front of us all is as indicated in paragraphs 3, 4. and 7 above, and action to deal with these points will be initiated at once.B. L. MONTGOMERY. Lt.-Gen..Comd. 8th Army.August 15, 1942.ANNEX II.Army Commander&apos;s Personal Memorandum No. 2.To Commander 10r/i Coi^ps, Commander V&amp;th Corps, Commander 30^A Corps,from Commander 8th A rmy.1. I wish to draw the attention of Corps and other Commanders to thefollowing points. They are of great importance and affect directly the&quot; atmosphere &quot; in which we now live; they also affect the morale of the troops,and morale is probably the biggest factor in war.Commanders speaking to their men.2. I am seriously alarmed at the idea, which seems prevalent, that units or sub-units in the Army area cannot be assembled in a compact body to be addressed by their own CO. or by their Coy., Sqn., Bty., &amp;c, Commander. It is apparentlyconsidered that the enemy may see such an assembly of men and shell it, or attackit from the air; this mentality exists even in reserve areas some way back behind the foremost positions.3. A Unit has got to be welded into a fighting machine, with the highest possible morale. The men have got to be given inspiration, and be imbued withinfectious optimism and offensive eagerness.In a Unit the men draw their inspiration from the Officers; and both Officersand men draw it from their CO.What happens in a Unit when the men look in vain to their Officers forinspiration ?   Nothing happens.4. I consider that if a Unit is to be welded into a fighting machine that wallfight with tenacity in battle, then it must be assembled regularly and the menaddressed personally by their Officers.In the most forward positions this action is clearly not possible, but in suchcases platoons, troops of artillery, &amp;c, can always be assembled and be addressed by the sub-unit commander. In rear positions complete companies and squadronscan be assembled; and in reserve areas whole units can be assembled, and be spoken to by their own Colonel. - -
5. If the matter is handled sensibly there is.no danger. The great danger is that officers should think they cannot ever assemble their men and speak tothem personally; officers who have this mentality are a menace.I therefore wish this matter tackled at once. If there are any orders inexistence which forbid the assembly of personnel in forward areas they will beconsidered as cancelled.I rely on all Commanders to use their military knowledge and their commonsense in interpreting my orders.I have no intention of allowing the Germans or anyone else to influence themethods I consider necessary to improve the fighting efficiency of the 8th Army.Concert Parties in Forward Areas.6. I find that no Concert Parties are at present allowed to operate in theArmy area owing to fear of enemy air attack against assemblies of troops.This is the same mentality as prevents commanders speaking to their men.7. I am greatly in favour of small concert parties operating anywhere inthe Army area, and especially right up in the area of forward Divisions. Themen in forward areas have a very dull time. I should like to see them collectedwherever possible in wadis, or concealed ground, and given a good entertainmentby a small concert party; a reaHy good concert party of two men and two womencould give great enjoyment to troops in forward areas. It will make them laughand forget for an hour the heat and the flies. It will all help to raise morale and keep the men happy.And. the concert parties will be delighted to operate in forward areas. I amarranging that they snail do so. and that they shall include women.8. Again, we must use common sense and not do foolish things; providedwe do this, we shall gain great benefit. Anything we can do to make the men havea good laugh, and to keep them from becoming bored or depressed, can have onlythe very&quot; best results.Training in Forward Areas.9.   I wish attention to be paid to the question of weapon training.From enquiries I have made, it appears that troops seldom practise shootingexcept when withdrawn to rear areas.But in forward areas the opportunities for shooting are quite excellent. we want to improve the skill of snipers and the general standard of the rank and filewith the rifle. Tins and bottles make excellent targets, the line of fire beingtowards the enemy.10. Men must fire the 6-pdr. gun and learn to handle this weapon with confidence.&apos;I visited a Company area recently in which there were four 6-pdr. guns, each with 160 rounds of ammunition; but they were never fired because there was nopractice ammunition.  This mentality must cease at once.I would far sooner get my men trained in the gun and have 100 to 120 roundsa gun rather than have untrained gunners with 160 rounds a gun. There areplenty of derelict enemy tanks and vehicles to form targets.11. So let us train the soldiery in the forward area, and in back areas, tobe expert in the use of their weapons. It will stand us in good stead on the dayof battle. And, if ammunition appears to be scarce, we must use our war stockssensibly.One thing is quite clear : unless the men are trained to shoot, we shall do no good on the day of battle, however great the number of rounds we have savedready for that day,B.
