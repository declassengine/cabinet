THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT - *SPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1942.SECRET. Copy No. 1 ?W.P. (42) 374.A ugust 24, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.BOMBER COMMAND.Note by the Secretary.THE attached note on the Role and Work of Bomber Command was preparedby Air Marshal Sir Arthur Harris at the request of the Prime Minister, and is circulated for the information of the War Cabinet by direction of the PrimeMinister.(Signed)      E. E. BRIDGES,Secretary of the War Cabinet.Great George Street, S.W. 1,A ugust 24, 1942.NOTE BY AIR MARSHAL SIR ARTHUR HARRIS, K.C.B., O.B.E., A.F.C.,ON THE ROLE AND WORK OF BOMBER COMMAND.1. THOSE who advocate the breaking-up of Bomber Command for thepurpose of adding strength to Coastal and Army Co-operation Commands and overseas requirements are like the amateur politician who imagines that themillennium will arrive through the simple process of dividing available cashequally between all. Ignorance of what is available for distribution is such thathe does not realise that the outcome would be to give every individual  50 onceat the cost of wrecking the entire industrial organisation and income of thecountry. Similarly, if the Medium and Heavy Bomber Operational squadrons of Bomber Command were distributed between the many claimants for favour onthe one hand, none of these claimants would receive anything more than a meremorsel towards the satisfaction of their alleged requirements. On the otherhand, our only offensive weapon against Germany would be destroyed. One cannotwin wars by defending oneself. The defensive use of offensive weapons must therefore be reduced .to the irreducible minimum necessary to survival.2. There is&apos; surprising ignorance about the effective strength of bomber command. On an average, if is able to produce about 30 operational medium and heavy night bomber squadrons and six light bomber squadrons, the latter with noreserves of aircraft behind them. The first-line strength of the operationalsquadrons of Bomber Command represents no more than 11 per cent, of the totaloperational first-line strength of the Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm, and well over half of the effort of this 11 per cent, is directed against Naval and military targets.   (See Appendix &quot; A.&quot;)[24102-2]b
3. People often point to the vast training organisation behind bomber command. It is truly and necessarily great. What such people fail to realise,however, is that the Bomber Command training organisation provides the wholerequirements for reinforcing all the bomber forces overseas and much else besides.At present, for instance, it provides 148 pilots per month for overseas bomber squadrons, including 95 complete crews. In the past this quota has at times beeneven higher. In addition to this monthly output for overseas requirements,Bomber Command has trained, equipped, and then given away or lent to Coastaland Overseas Commands and other claimants, 24 squadrons in the last year. it also provides the crews of 2 squadrons employed on special S.O.E. and S.I.S.duties, and crews to man a great number of experimental and special training units, which work for all Commands, at home and overseas. Finally, it isrequired from time to time to find from 300 to 400 operational aircraft in orderto make up the 1,000 or so required to carry out specially heavy attacks against objectives of major importance.4. Another common error is to suppose that the effort of the Command is devoted to the bombing of targets in Germany remote from and chosen without reference to the general military and naval situation. Nothing could be furtherfrom the truth. Approximately 50 per cent, of the total operational effort of bomber Command during the twelve months April 1941-March 1942 was directlyemployed against the enemy&apos;s sea power. (For details, see Appendix &quot; B.&quot;)During the last three months the proportion has been well over 50 per cent. Allthe remaining efforts of Bomber Command have great direct effect on the Navaland Land war situations as a whole.5. For all practical purposes the squadrons of Bomber Command have donealmost all the air-sea mining throughout the War. They have laid some,000 odd ,mines from the beginning of the War to December 1941, whichaccounted &quot;for one known enemy ship per 26-2 mines (it can be reasonably assumed that at least one unknown ship was sunk or damaged for every known one).The Command has enormously increased its mining efforts since the beginningof March this year. It is now laying mines at the rate of over a thousand amonth, and already the reports on sinkings are greatly increased over anythingpreviously achieved. Amongst particular mining successes can be counted the closing of the Kiel Canal to heavy enemy ships for some four months and thedamaging and sinking of several of the highly specialised Baltic train ferriesand ice-breaker ferries on which the enemy is peculiarly dependent. Also, the sinking by mining and bombing, according to the evidence from German wreckcharts, of something over 300 enemy-employed ships, and damage to a largenumber more. The mining of both Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, and also otherenemy war vessels and troop transports, some of which are known to have resultedin great loss of life, must also be taken into account.8. The story of the Scharnhorst and the Gneisenau is perhaps an outstand-ing incident of the vast effect of the small Bomber Command force on the Navalwar. These two ships, on their one and only raid into the Atlantic, did appalling-damage to our shipping, sinking no few than 19 vessels, totalling 150,000 tons.They returned to Brest to refuel and turn round prior to repeated forays, but since that date, over fifteen months ago, and almost entirely due to the efforts of bomber Command, they have never been able to sink another British or Alliedship. They have only, just been able to escape and stagger home, both of themstriking air-laid mines on their return journey. Since their arrival in Kiel forrepair, Scharnhorst is known to have been further hit and heavily damaged.Gneisenau has been so heavily hit and damaged by bombs that she has been taken away to Gdynia and largely dismantled. There are circumstantial reports thatit has been decided to abandon repair on her. Prinz Eugen was also hit at Brestby Bomber Command. The direct result of the damage to these important ships is that throughout the war the German Fleet has never been able to operate as anentity, with all that that implies. It was directly due to the immobilisation ofScharnhorst and Gneisenau that Bismarck essayed her lone raid in the atlantic and to that fact can be largely credited her subsequent destruction. To bomber command, therefore, can also largely be credited the fact that Tirpitz in herturn is now a lone wolf.
7. Additional and direct effects on the war efficiency of the German Fleetarising from the efforts of Bomber Command are as follows :  (i) The main enemy Naval base at Kiel has been repeatedly and veryheavily damaged by bomber attacks. A large number of workshopshave been destroyed and the dockyard workers&apos; quarters havereceived vast damage, with all that that implies in regard to delay in naval supply and repair work.(ii) Amongst other instances the depot ship Monte Olivia was bombed andburnt out, with reported heavy loss of life to submarine ratings andsome of Gneisenau&apos;s crew who were living on board.(iii) There is no doubt that the morale of enemy Naval personnel, wholargely come from the German coastal ports, has been seriously affected by the heavy damage, and the raid-fear inflicted on these ports and their populace.8. The six light bomber squadrons of Bomber Command are responsible forthe close support of the Army in the event of invasion, or in the event of theArmy proceeding overseas. They provide the bait for Fighter Command with-out which the fighter sweeps would be ineffective, because the enemy often refusesbattle unless bombers are present. They also provided the detachments at Maltawhich so successfully attacked the enemy&apos;s lines of communication. They &quot;are known to have sunk some 51,000 tons of enemy shipping on that supply line. by direct bomber attack in European waters, these light bomber squadrons have sunk some 250,000 tons, seriously damaged 287,000 tons and damaged a further380,000 tons.9. The effects on the enemy&apos;s submarine activities have been equally important. It is known that repeated interference with submarine crew trainingresulted from our mine laying in the Baltic and the Bight. It is known that,from time to time, considerable damage has been done to submarine buildingyards are Hamburg, Kiel, Rostock, Emden and other ports. Heavy damage hasbeen done to the three main submarine Diesel engine factories at Augsburg,Deutz, and the Germania yards at Kiel. Damage has also been done to one ofthe two main submarine accumulator factories. In addition, the widespreaddamage done to German industry by Bomber Command, perhaps especially inCologne, must have profoundly affected the submarine campaign. It is known that, at the submarine building yard at Le Trait, three submarines under con-struction were reported destroyed and between 150 and 200 workmen employedon them were killed.10. It can also be safely assumed that damage has been inflicted onsubmarines operating from the French West Coast ports. Although the actualcause of loss of a submarine which does not return can seldom be determined, theknown losses inflicted on German shipping remove any shadow of doubt that,some losses, possibly considerable losses,&apos; have been inflicted on the enemy submarine fleet by Bomber CommancTs minelaying. (For details seeAppendix &quot; C&quot;)11. By smashing up the invasion ports and the invasion barges and shippingconcentrations, there is little doubt that Bomber Command had impressed uponthe enemy the difficulties, if not the impossibility, of invasion. Indeed, historymay yet show that invasion was prevented by the Command. It certainly canbe if it is attempted in future.12. The known results of the bombing raids on Germany show that theycause vast destruction and vast embarrassment to the enemy. It would not bepossible in a note to detail a tithe of the known, immense damage occasioned inGermany. Whilst it takes approximately some 7,000 hours of flying to destroyone submarine at sea, that was approximately the amount of flying necessary to destroy one-third of Cologne, the third largest city in Germany, in one night,a town of vast industrial import. 250 of its factories were damaged or destroyed.This must have gravely embarrassed the enemy war effort in every direction.The towns of Rostock, Lubeck, Emden and Cologne have all been destroyed toor beyond the point where they can be counted as a liability rather than an assetto the enemy. The very heavy damage to the Heinkel Aircraft Factory at Rostockis known to have gravely affected the Heinkel output, and is reported to have[24102-2] B 2
(had the most serious effect on the enemy&apos;s air war on all fronts, and also at sea.The Focke Wulf works at Bremen have also been very seriously damaged.13. The destruction of the Renault Factory might be counted as anastounding achievement of Bomber Command. Achieved in a few hours withpractically no loss it is clearly a major victory against the enemy&apos;s land forcessuch as no other of our forces has yet achieved. Through the loss of this factory and the Matford works at Poissy, the enemy is known, according to the Ministryof Economic Warfare, to have been permanently deprived of the armoured fighting vehicles and transport equipment sufficient for the formation and,maintenance of 10/11 motorised divisions.* The important enemy aircraft factories at Gennevilliers and Salmsons have been destroyed. The Goodrichrubber factory, and the Thomson Houston and Ericsson Electrical gear factoryhave also been destroyed, and 16 neighbouring factories damaged, some &quot;on a tremendous scale &quot; (Interpretation Report K. 1351).14. One of Germany&apos;s most pressing problems is to maintain her systemof internal transport. The German Transport Minister recently stated that,unless the problem of improving the transport facilities inside Germany weresolved, Germany&apos;s victory would be imperilled. He said that in the western and north-western regions of Germany, where frequent bombing raids had takenplace, the transport service was carried out under extremely difficult conditions.An additional strain is thrown upon the railways by the diversion of trafficcaused by sea-mining, while the bombing of ports and industrial towns has been shown to do much incidental damage to the transport services. It is known thatthe internal transport system has recently been put under the control of theGerman Minister responsible for armaments production and that very highpriorities, which must interfere with other production, have been given to loco-motive and&apos;wagon construction, and repair. Concomitant with this declaration by the Reich Minister, Bomber Command virtually destroyed the importantrolling-stock works at Cologne and severely damaged another such works atBremen.15. To the negative, but very worthwhile, credit of Bomber Command canbe counted the strain upon the enemy of maintaining an enormous and ever-increasing mine-sweeping effort, and also the establishment and maintenance ofthe largest anti-aircraft and A.R.P. organisation in the world. Some three-quarters of a million personnel are employed on anti-aircraft duties in Germany.If one adds to that the A.R.P. services, the damage and repair organisation andthe manufacture of guns and their anti-aircraft ammunition, and also the mine-sweeping and mined ship repairing organisation, there is little doubt that thevery existence of Bomber Command costs the enemy the whole-time services ofat least three million able-bodied personnel. In addition, Bomber Commandforced the enemy to maintain a large and rapidly increasing force of night fighters,which now amounts to some 300 aircraft. Many of these are Ju. 88&apos;s, a type which, if released, could be used effectively for the attack of our shipping. Thereis no doubt that, if the Bomber policy was to be abandoned, the release of thisvast man-power for other essential work would be of the greatest value to Germany.The release of the twin-engine fighter bombers and the anti-aircraft guns for service on the eastern front and in the Mediterranean would have a powerful and perhaps even a decisive effect on those campaigns.16. The purely defensive use of air power is grossly wasteful. The Navalemployment of aircraft consists of picking at the fringes of enemy power, of waiting for opportunities that may never occur, and indeed probably never willoccur, of looking for needles in a haystack. They attempt to sever each capillaryvein, one by one, when they could, with much less effort, cut the artery. bomber command attacks the sources of all Naval power, rather than the fringes of theone type of enemy Naval operation which obviously menaces us the submarine.An outstanding example of waste of air effort is the taking away from bomber command of all the Hampden aircraft for conversion to torpedo bombers for thedefence of this country. These squadrons have, for more than two years, exercisedcontinuous and direct pressure on Germany. Since allocation to coastal command they have done practically nothing.   It is within the bounds of* More than our Libyan operations have destroyed in the whole course of the war, almost as much as we lost at Dunkirk.
possibility that they will never get an opportunity to achieve anything. Theenemy is not such a fool as to flaunt valuable ships within reach of shore-based aircraft otherwise than when compelled by circumstances to do so, and then onlyon his own terms as to weather and fighter cover.17.   To sum up, Bomber Command provides our only offensive action yetpressed home directly against Germany.   All our other efforts are defensive intheir nature, and are not intended to do more, and can never do more, than enable us to exist in the face of the enemy.  Bomber Command provides the only meansd of bringing assistance to Russia in time.  The only means of physically weakeningand nervously exhausting Germany to an extent which will make subsequentinvasion a possible proposition, and is therefore the only force which can, in fact,hurt our enemy in the present or in the future secure our victorj7. It is the onlytype of force which we shall ever be able to bring directly&apos; against Japan.18. Finally, it is apparent that an extraordinary lack of sense of proportionaffects outside appreciation of the meaning, extent and results of bomber command&apos;s operations. What shouts of victory would arise if a Commandowrecked the entire Renault factory in a night, with a loss of seven men! Whatcredible assumptions of an early end to the war would follow upon the destructionof a third of Cologne in an hour and a half by some swift moving mechanisedforce which, with but 200 casualties, withdrew and was ready to repeat theoperation 24 hours later! What acclaim would greet the virtual destruction ofRostock and the Heinkel main and subsidiary factories by a Naval bombardment!All this, and far more, has been achieved by Bomber Command; yet there are many who still avert their gaze, pass by on the other side, and question whetherthe 30 Squadrons of night bombers make any worth-while contribution to the war.June 28, 1942.SECRET.APPENDIX &quot;A.&quot;Approximate Allocation of our Air Resources on June 15, 1942.Command.Bomber Command ...Fighter Command ...Fleet Air ArmCoastal Command  ...(Including Iceland and Gibraltar)Overseas Coastal Command and G.R.Army Co-operation CommandOverseas engaged in support of land operations Fighter        ...       ...       ......BomberArmy Co-operation ...TransportOperationalSquadrons.3697^4532 + P.R.U5314I.E.

SECRET.APPENDIX &quot; C.&quot;The Contribution of Bomber Command to the Anti-Submarine Campaign.Introduction.1. Over half the effort of Bomber Command has been, and still is, directedon targets appertaining to sea warfare. During the 12 months April 1941 to march 1942 no less than 12,000 sorties were carried out against harbours, ship-building yards, docks and submarine bases, while 1,577 mines were laid. Thelast three months have seen an immense increase in the mining effort, over 2,700having been laid. The same period has also witnessed the virtual destructionby Bomber Command of the vital ports of Rostock, lubeck  and Emden, the attack on the submarine diesel engine factory at Augsburg and the devastatingraid on the city and suburbs of Cologne, with its submarine component factories.2. It is important at this time, when the enemy&apos;s submarine production has reached the figure of 22 a month, to review the damage and dislocation causedby bombs and mines to the sources of submarine production and to submarinerepair, resting and training bases. The evidence of damage is, however, derivedmainly from air photos, which are capable of showing only a fraction of the concrete results of bombing and give no indication of the interruption to buildingprocesses and training of crews, of the effect of bombing on the efficiency and morale of workers and of the number of submarines sunk by mines. Theseintangible results, which are likely to decrease the output and activities of submarines even more than the actual destruction of vessels on slips or fitting out,can only be assessed in the light of our own experience and from occasional reports from most secret sources and agents.Submarine Building Yards and Output.3. Emden (7), Wilhelmshaven (11), - Bremerhaven (6), Bremen (29),Vegesack (18), Le Trait (3), Hamburg (95), Kiel (44), Flensburg (11), lubeck  (10),Rostock (2), Stettin (3) and Danzig (29).The numbers indicate the building capacity at each yard.Advanced Bases: Brest, Lorient, St. Nazaire, La Pallice, Bordeaux and Trondheim.All these building yards and bases, with the exception of Danzig, Trondheim,lubeck  and La Pallice, have been objectives of Bomber Command attacks, andthey are referred to in detail below.Emden.4. At Emden is the Nordseewerke, which has a building potential of seven500-ton submarines a year. In the Summer of 1941 three submarines were damaged beyond repair and were later seen being dismantled. In February 1942a submarine which was on the point of departure was destroyed.5. On the night of 6th/7th June the majority of the workshops were completely destroyed, and on the night of 20th/21st June further destructionwas achieved. Before these two attacks the yard contained six large shops,11 medium-sized shops and about 14 smaller buildings. Now, all that is left isone large shop, which has received a direct hit and is very badly damaged, fourmedium shops and three small buildings.6. In these two nights the town, docks, and suburbs of Emden were destroyed to the extent of about 75 per cent, of built-up area including the main railway station; while the Schulte and Bruns Yard, which built small craft, waswiped out, the Herings Fischerie almost completely destroyed and Gassen&apos;s bargebuilding yard razed, to the ground.7. In fact, Emden has ceased to be a going concern and its submarinebuilding yard, in view of the almost complete destruction of its buildings, canbe confidently claimed, to have been put out of action. How long it would take tore build and to re-stock with components, jigs, and machine tools cannot be assessed, but it is reasonable to suggest that it will take a long time.
Wilhelmshaven.8. Most successful attacks were made on this Naval base early in 1941.5,000 men were put out of work in January; three Naval barracks were destroyedwith severe casualties; the equipment depot was damaged and large quantitiesof clothing were lost and 35 per cent, of the houses in the port area were rendereduninhabitable. Moreover, out of eight submarines which should have been launched by the end of July only three had left the slips and the average date of completion was then three months behind schedule. In January 1942 it was reported that four submarines had been sent to another port owing to damage inrecent attacks.Bremen.9. The three yards at this port are responsible for 17 per cent, of submarineoutput. In the raids at the beginning of 1941, the Atlass Werke sufferedconsiderable damage and an informant present at the time confirmed that three off its four slipways were seriously damaged and that store sheds were burnt out.All work at this yard stopped for several days. The total destruction of Bremenis scheduled and has commenced.Vegesack.10. This is an important yard 11 miles down the river from Bremen. Itis a difficult target to locate and has only been lightly attacked. A report inJune 1941 stated that three slips, which had been badly damaged, were beingrepaired.Hamburg.11. Twenty-two 750-ton and seventy-three 500-ton submarines are producedannually from Hamburg&apos;s two building yards. Kiel has the next largest annual output, amounting to 44.12. In the summer and autumn of 1941, Blohm &amp; Voss (the largest yard)was hit several times. Five submarines on the slips were severely damaged; a gascontainer was blown up and various workshops, together with workers&apos; homesnear the yard, were partially or completely destroyed with heavy casualties.13. In March 1941 the foundry at Blohm &amp; Voss received a direct hit, whiledamage was done to the engine erecting shop, the galvanising shop, theadministrative offices and to submarines on the slips. The Vulcan Yard sustainedmore widespread damage, while Siemens Electrical Equipment Factory was burnt out.14. It is known that this raid held up work at Blohm &amp; Voss for 3 weeks and. at the Vulcan Yard for a fortnight.15. Blohm &amp; Voss Yard was again hit during two raids in May 1941,when a large building near the power house was partly destroyed and the powerhouse itself damaged. In September the engine testing shed at Howalts yardwas so seriously damaged that 20 submarine engines were rendered useless and, inaddition, two out of the six submarines on the slips were almost completely destroyed. In October two floating docks were damaged, together with a1,400-ton destroyer and a 500-ton submarine which were in them.    1Kiel.16. A Naval Engineer states that, as a result of the raids on the docksduring April 1941, work on several vessels under construction was suspended forten days and that casualties were between 800 and 1,000. The Germania andDeutsche yards had to close down for a period owing to damage to the electricalsystem. In the raid of the 1st May ships and submarines on the slips were damaged.17. Later in May it was learnt that the raids had been most effective andthat the production of submarines had been delayed. The Germania works wereconcentrating at that time on increasing production at Danzig on account of the severe damage they had suffered at Kiel; the- German Admiralty took over two large buildings in Oslo with a view to transferring their important Naval officesfrom Kiel.
18. It is known that a 1,000-ton submarine already on the slips on the7th April was still present in August and that two 750-ton submarines were seen to have been on the slips for 11 months, whereas the normal time should have been only eight months.19. In October 1941 the Deutsche Werke yard sustained severe damage,and, although production continued, 1,000 employees remained unemployed untilrepairs to shops had been effected. On the 16th February, 1942, a bomb fell onthe assembly shed at the Marine Werft and the majority of the night workers were killed.20. The above information about damage and delays to submarine produc-tion at Kiel has been obtained from reliable ground sources, but photographicevidence, which is too extensive to enumerate in this paper, amply bears it out.In addition, no less than 33 acres of heavily built-up residential areas of the cityhave been completely devastated, and there are many isolated incidents. this factor alone must considerably affect output in the yards. One report stated that400 submarine ratings were killed when the &quot;Monte Olivia&quot; class depot-ship was bombed and burnt out in Kiel Harbour.Lubeck.21. The submarine-building yards north of Lubeck were not a specifictarget on the night when this city was destroyed, but the important Dragerwerke,which manufactured oxygen apparatus for submarines, were seriously damaged.22. There is little doubt that the output of all undestroyed factories nearLubeck must have stopped for a considerable time after the attack for lack oftransport, power and labour, and it is inevitable that the general dislocation ofindustrial, domestic and transport facilities seriously affected the output of thesubmarine yards.Rostock.23. The elimination of Rostock by the four attacks at the end of April islikely to have stopped work on the two submarines then building at the NeptuneYard, apart from the fact that the yard itself sustained severe damage. Whetherit will be considered possible or expedient to continue shipbuilding in this deadcity remains to be seen.Le Trait.24. Most of the important workshops at this French building yard,together with the three submarines then under construction, were destroyed bya small-scale daylight raid on the 25th March; 150 to 200 workmen are said tohave been killed. . *Brest.25. On the 24th July, 1941, a submarine under repair was hit and seriously damaged. In October of that year the submarine shelter was damaged. Photo-graphs indicate extensive damage to dockside workshops and warehouses.Lorient. -26. In 1940 two submarines were sunk and two damaged^by bombs; inDecember another submarine was sunk and in March 1941 another was damaged.In July 1941 the torpedo section of the arsenal was damaged.St. Nazaire.      *   .27. In May 1941 the submarine shelter and torpedo depot were hit and a submarine and other vessels damaged. Many workshops have been damagedsince then, and it is probable the roof of the submarine pen has been hit.Bordeaxue.28. In 1940 a German submarine in dock was. damaged by bomb splinters,when three Italian submarines also sustained damage. Later it was reliablyreported that two Italian submarines and the submarine depot ship De Grasse
had been sunk. In January 1941 six Italian submarines suffered damage and, inthe same attack, many workshops in the area were hit.Augsburg.29. The daylight attack on the M.A.N. Submarine Diesel Engine factory in April 1942, although carried out by only 8 aircraft, achieved remarkablesuccess. Even the air phonographs show substantial and vital damage not only. to the main assembly shop, which appears to be gutted, but also to six other buildings and shops. A.A., Berne, has confirmed that the assembly shop is com-pletely destroyed, and a civil engineer who was commissioned to report on the damage estimated that normal work could not be resumed for three months. he also said that quantities of stores and material had been destroyed and that therewas a heavy death-roll among the employees. This factory is the most important of its kind and produces 20 submarine engines a month. The engines for allU-boats built by Blohm and Voss are made by the M.A.N. firm.Cologne.30. The Humboldt Deutz and the Hagen Gottfried works adjoin each other in the Kalk suburb of Cologne. The former, together with the other Humboldtworks at Cologne-Deutz, is the third largest producer of submarine engines,whilst the latter produces submarine accumulators.31. The great attack on Cologne in June this year, in which a third of thecity was devastated, must seriously affect the output of these component factories.Apart from transport, feeding and housing difficulties, the morale, and therefore the efficiency of the workers must have been lowered. Moreover, all three ofthese works have sustained damage. A long warehouse was almost gutted and six others damaged at the Kalk works in April; a large shop was damaged at thesame works in May and, during the big attack, both the Kalk and the Deutzworks were hit, six buildings at the latter being completely destroyed.The Effect of Mining.32. Bomber Command had laid 1,577 mines in the approaches to Germanharbours and to French West Coast bases up to the 1st March, 1942. Since thatdate it has laid no less than 3,011 mines, including 715 in Baltic areas.33. In the period 1st May-14th June (45 days) 26 ships are known to havebeen sunk by these mines and 12 damaged. There is little doubt that unreportedlosses at least equal known losses. Only one instance is known of a submarinehaving been sunk by a mine, and this was in the mouth of the Gironde, in May1941. How many have in fact been mined will, of course, never be known, for only in exceptional circumstances could there be survivors or other evidence ofsuch incidents. It is not unreasonable, however, to suggest that a substantial number have been lost to this weapon, in view of the heavy casualties in enemy-employed merchant shipping.34. Tne presence of mines in the approaches to submarine bases and intraining waters is in itself a disturbing factor to submarine activities. Not onlymust channels be swept before they leave or enter harbour, but there is convincing evidence that when mining operations have taken place the movements of trainingsubmarines aap restricted or suspended until the whole of the suspected area hasbeen swept, //Conclusion.35. The information in the foregoing paragraphs has been extracted fromC.I.U. Reports and from Air Ministry Damage Assessment&apos;Reports. Photo-graphs only tell part of the story, while ground observers and agents are by nomeans always reliable. Nevertheless, the weight of evidence is sufficient to prove that the Command has substantially restricted submarine output and activity,even with the small forces which have so far been available. With the improvedtactics and aids to navigation which have recently been developed it is certainthat destruction can be achieved to submarine yards, bases and factories and totheir parent cities which will play a vital part in the anti-submarine campaign.Emden is the first example of what is intended.
