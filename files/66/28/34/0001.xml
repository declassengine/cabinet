THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1942.SECRET.W.P. (42) 404.September 8, 1942.WAR CABINET.EXTRA-TERRITORIALITY IN CHINA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I informed my colleagues on the 7th September (W.M. (42) 121. Minute 2 :China) that the United States Ambassador had proposed to me, on behalfof his Government, that we should jointly approach the Chinese Govern-ment with an offer to negotiate brief treaties for the termination of our extra-territorial and related rights in China. The Cabinet expressed approval inprinciple of this proposal, and I have informed the United States Ambassadoraccordingly.For the information of my colleagues I now circulate a paraphrase of the message which the United States Ambassador communicated to me on thissubject (Annex A), together with my reply (Annex B).A. E.Foreign Office, September 8, 1942.ANNEX A.Paraphrase of telegram from State Department to United States Embassy,communicated on September 1, 1942.(1) Study by the Department of the question of relinquishment in China ofthis country&apos;s extra-territorial and related rights has continued. We have takeninto account, of course, the trend of public opinion in this country in this study.It has been obvious from speeches by and. letters received from interested persons and also from editorial &quot;comment that popular sentiment in favor of actiontoward abolishing extra-territoriality is fairly widespread, even though therehas been no strong concerted pressure upon this Government to take action.Any request by the Chinese Government for abolition would receive strong-support in the United States, it is believed. We are inclining to the view,in the light of this and other factors, that even though this is not analtogether opportune moment to take some affirmative steps in the matter it isdoubtful whether, in the near future, any much more favorable occasion is likelyto occur. We might, on the contrary later find, ourselves in a position lessadvantageous &apos;than at the present, while the question of initiative is within our control, because of the natural trends of political thinking in China as well as inthis and other countries.(2) Of course, we have, in our examination of the whole problem, endeavorednot only to consider the disadvantages and advantages of taking action, but wehave also given thought to the question of what means of initiating action wouldbe most beneficial and effective to all concerned should the decision be made totake action. Our thought inclines, in this connection, to a procedure and action as set forth below in paragraph (3).11844   [24330]Copy No.
(3) A confidential approach to the Chinese Government along the following lines : Continuing thought has been given by the American and British Govern-ments to the question of relinquishment respectively of American and Britishextra-territorial rights in China. If they could find some practicable step whichmight be taken at this time to further clarify the fact that they favor the termina-tion of extra-territorial practices and rights in China and regard themselvespledged to give up the special rights of that character which they now possess, theywould both be pleased. Such a step, they believe, would serve to delineate byadditional particularization the general framework of the relationship whichwill, in the future, exist between China and the United States and also betweenChina and Great Britain, particularly in the post-war world. Also, they believethat it might be helpful to the peoples of all three countries to have more precise information than is available now regarding the purposes and concepts of thethree Governments in reference to the question of extra-territorial jurisdiction.Of course, an orthodox way of proceeding would be for the Chinese and american governments and for the Chinese and British Governments to enter into negotiations for the conclusion of new treaties conforming with the generalforms in international relationships and based on the best modern internationalpractices, which treaties would supplant existing treaties of special character and would provide for the final and complete termination of extra-territorial rights and for the substitution therefor of the usual rights of establishment andof trade. Such a procedure would be a practical manifestation of and in con-formity with the principle to which the Chinese, the American, and the british governments are committed of proceeding by orderly process of negotiation and agreement in international relationships.The Brutish Government and the American Government, up to this time,have made no approach to the Chinese Government on this matter because of thestatement contained in the letter of the Secretary of State of the 31st May. 1941,en this subject to the appointed Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs and of the like, and indicated, position of the British Government, That the question ofBritish and American extra-territorial rights in China has not seemed to be aquestion of urgent practical importance at this particular time, when the mainefforts of China, the United States and Great Britain are necessarily directedtoward achieving military success in the war, has been a further factor. TheBritish and American Governments would be agreeable to entering into negotia-tions immediately with the Chinese Government directed toward terminationof extra-territorial and related rights with and by the conclusion of modern newtreaties if the Chinese Government should feel that it is advisable that affirmations-tive action be taken now. The modern treaties which the British Governmentand American Government have, during recent years, made a practice of concluding are comprehensive documents that cover a considerable variety of subjects. The negotiation of such a treaty normally requires some months for full interchange of views to the end that entirely satisfactory conclusions maybe arrived at which will be agreeable to both parties, even though the provisions are in a sense fairly standardized. It is assumed, in view of the complexity of modern international intercourse and of China&apos;s place in the family of nations,that the Chinese Government would also favor the conclusion of such compre-hensive treaties in principle.The fact that the negotiations are in process could probably not bekept confidential, in addition to the fact that negotiation of this type of treaty would probably not be completed for several months. Every available opportunityto criticize to their own advantage any apparent differing of views between theparties to the negotiations or any delay in negotiations might be expected to be seized by the enemy Governments. It is believed that the factors which havebeen mentioned need to be taken into consideration, even though there is not tobe anticipated any undue delay or the emergence of important difficulties. TheAmerican and the British Governments suggest, in view of the circumstances as outlined above, that, should the Chinese Government feel it would be useful forsome further step to be taken at this time, the American and the Chinese.Governments and the British and the Chinese Governments might respectivelyenter into negotiations for the conclusion of brief treaties which would providefor the relinquishment of American and British extra-territorial and relatedrights in China by the United States and Great Britain and for the adjustment of a few broad questions which would arise in connection with and uponrelinquishment of extra-territorial rights.   Negotiation of such a brief treaty
probably would take much less time than the negotiation of a comprehensive,detailed treaty and it would not incur the same risk of premature publicity.The negotiation of a brief treaty would not, thus, be open to the samedisadvantages as the negotiation of a comprehensive treaty at this time. Therewould arise some doubt, moreover, as to the practicality of endeavoring to provide,at this time, in a treaty for detailed provisions covering all usual aspects ofinternational intercourse during a period of war and while the enemy is in temporary military occupation of parts of the territory of China.A brief treaty between China and the United States would contain, in ourthought, the following : A. Provision for immediate relinquishment of &quot;&quot;American extra-territorial and related rights, in relation to the international settlements atAmoy and at Shanghai, and including American rights under theBoxer Protocol of the 7th September, 1901;B. Provision for discussion between Chinese and American representativesof any questions relating to satisfaction of contractual obligation?entered into with American nationals by the authorities of the diplomatic quarter at Peiping or of the international settlementsat Amoy and at Shanghai;C. An undertaking by the Chinese Government to regard existing Americanrights in China relating to real property as indefeasible, with provision that replacement of American-held leases in perpetuity bynew deeds of ownership such as are issued to Chinese owners of landmight be effected by the Chinese Government, and with provision that american nationals shall not be required to pay any past land taxesor charges or fees of any nature with respect to land in addition tothose already paid;D. A provision that inasmuch as the American Government has longaccorded to Chinese nationals while within the territories of theUnited States of America rights to travel, to reside and carry on trade, except in respect to certain areas closed for reasons of national security, the Chinese Government would accord to American nationalswhile within the territories of China similar rights;E. Reciprocal provision for consular representation by consular officers dulyprovided with exequatur;F. Provision that the Chinese and American Governments will enter into negotiations for the conclusion of a comprehensive modern treaty of establishment, commerce, consular rights, navigation and friendshipupon the request of either Government or in any case within sixmonths after the cessation of hostilities, such treaty to be based uponprinciples of modern international law and practice; and provision that any questions affecting the rights in China of american nationals arising as a result of relinquishment of Americanextra-territorial rights shall be decided where not covered by existingtreaties on the basis of generally accepted principles of moderninternational law until such a comprehensive modern treaty shall havebeen concluded.(4) Is suggested, as part of the approach outlined in paragraph (3) above,that the British Government and the American Government present brief drafttreaties as described to the Chinese Government for consideration.(5) Should any approach be made to the Chinese Government, it might ensuethat the Chinese Government, would prefer that no action be taken in referenceto this matter at this particular time, after consideration of various factors.That an approach at this time might cause the Chinese Government to press for final and immediate relinquishment of British and American extra-territorial rights in China without waiting for the negotiation of new treaties is also possible. Our present thought inclines to favouring the making of an approach,even though being aware of this possibility.(6) Will you please communicate the foregoing to Mr. Eden and state thatwe should appreciate an early expression of the views of the British Government.It may be added that we are, of course, as previously indicated, desirous of dealingwith this matter in co-operation and consultation with the Government ofGreat Britain.HULL.
ANNEX B.Reply to United States Embassy.HIS Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents hiscompliments to His Excellency the United States Ambassador and has the honourto inform him that careful consideration has been given to the communicationleft with this Department by the Counsellor to the United States Embassy on the1st September last, embodying the proposal that an approach should now be madeto the Chinese Government on the subject of extra-territorial and related rights in China.His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom agree that, while thepresent time is not altogether opportune to raise this question with the ChineseGovernment, it is doubtful whether any much more favourable occasion is likelyto occur in the near future, and they see considerable advantage in acting whilethe initiative in the matter still rests with the Powers possessing extra-territorial rights. His Majesty&apos;s Government cordially welcome therefore the United states government proposal that steps should now be taken by the United StatesGovernment and His Majesty&apos;s Government in co-operation to arrive at a settle-ment of this question; and, subject to the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;governments in the Dominions, whose -views are being obtained without delay,they will be glad to prepare in consultation with the United States authoritiesa brief draft treaty on the lines suggested, for presentation to the ChineseGovernment when the time arrives to make the joint approach contemplated bythe United States Government.Meanwhile His Majesty&apos;s Government agree that it would be desirable to limit action at present to the conclusion of a brief treaty dealing only with the abrogation of extra-territorial rights and the related questions referred to inthe State.Departments communication. They are impressed with the disadvan-tages set out by the State Department of negotiating a comprehensive treaty of establishment and commerce while hostilities are in progress, and they stronglyincline to the view that if any such suggestion is advanced by the Chinese Govern-ment, the two Governments should insist on the larger question being postponed until the end of the war.A further point relates to Shanghai, which, in view of the vast extent ofUnited States and British commercial interests centred there, appears to presenta special problem. His Majesty&apos;s Government have reason to believe that whilethe Chinese Government would require the return of the whole area to unfetteredChinese rule they would be ready to grant Shanghai a special status to enablethe development of the port to continue with the co-operation of foreign commer-cial interests. It is considered important therefore that the proposed treatiesshould not preclude the United States Government and His Majesty&apos;s government from pressing for this special status at the peace settlement; possibly somemention of this question might be included in the treaties.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would be glad if the fore-going could at once be communicated to the United States Government with an expression of thanks for the courtesy with which the proposal has beentransmitted to them. The United States Ambassador will be informed of theviews of His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions as soon as they are received.Foreign Office, September 8, 1942.
