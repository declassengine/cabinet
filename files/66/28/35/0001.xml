SECRET. -x Copy No.   Of)W.P. (42) 405.September 9, 1942.WAR CABINET.AIR POLICY.Note by the Prime Minister.I HAVE circulated two papers (W.P. (42) 374 and 399) by Air MarshalHarris and Lord Trenchard on Air policy. I do not myself adopt or endorse theviews expressed, which I think fall into the error of spoiling a good case byoverstatement. Nevertheless, as these papers are written with force and vigour,I thought they might be of interest to my colleagues. They also serve as aconsiderable answer to those who attack the usefulness of our Bombing policy.w. s. c.10, downing Street, Whitehall,September 9, 1942.[24331]Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1942.
