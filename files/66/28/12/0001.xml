NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1.   Brazil declared war on Germany and Italy on the 22nd.Naval and air operations are in progress in the Solomons, where Japanesereinforcements have arrived.Shipping losses have been light. A concentrated U-boat attack was madeon an outward convoy in mid-Atlantic. There have been no U-boat attacks on shipping off North American Coast.Home Waters.2. During the night of 23rd/24th, four M.G.Bs. on patrol intercepted alarge&apos; enemy force of light minelaying craft in the Dover Strait. One enemycraft was set on fire and several others were damaged. Some damage and casualties were caused in two of the M.T.Bs. and an M.L. was minedin attempting to make contact with the enemy. Coastal batteries on both sides of the Straits opened fire during the action.On the following night, enemy coastal forces were engaged by M.T.Bs. andM.G.Bs. off Flushing and at least one enemy vessel is believed to have been torpedoed.   Two M.T.Bs. and one M.G.B. were damaged.E-boats were inconclusively engaged off the East Coast on the night of the25th/26th by H.M. Destroyer &quot;Mendip and M.G.Bs.On the night of the 27th/28th our light craft were in action with fourE-boats east of Cape Barfleur.Three landing-craft barges were sunk by air attack in the River Dart onthe 24th.Northern Waters.3. On the 25th, the unarmed Russian transport Sibiyakov (4,500 tons), inthe eastern Kara Sea, sighted an unidentified ship, which opened fire. Nothingfurther has been received from the Sibiyakov.Mediterranean.4. H.M: Submarine P211, between the 16th and 18th, sank an empty tankerof 10,000 tons by torpedo, south-east of Sardinia, and a 250-ton ammunitionschooner and a 50-ton sailing vessel by gunfire, off eastern Sardinia.H.M. Submarine P.35 sank a south-bound ship of 5,000 tons west of Crete.H.M. Destroyers Eridge and A Idenham bombarded the Daba area during the night of the 25th/26th.Naval aircraft have bombed shipping off Mersa Matruh and Sidi Barrani,have carried out a shipping search off the Tunisian Coast and, in conjunctionwith the R.A.F., have bombed land targets in the Western Desert.The Captain of H.M.S. Manchester, now interned in Tunis, states that theship was sunk by an Italian E-boat which was lying in wait in French territorial waters.  This E-boat and one other was destroyed by the Manchester.During the week only one Vichy French ship, the Liner Marechal Lyautey(8,256 tons), and one trawler, both eastbound and escorted, have passed Gibraltar.Pacific.Solomon Islands.5. On the 23rd, Allied aircraft attacked Tulagi and destroyed twenty-oneJapanese aircraft with only minor losses. Japanese destroyers shelled UnitedStates shore positions on Guadalcanal Island on the same day. On the 24th, anenemy cruiser and a transport were set on fire north of Guadalcanal by UnitedStates aircraft. On the 25th, Japanese main naval forces arrived in the Solomonsand were attacked by United States land-based and carrier-borne aircraft. one large enemy aircraft-carrier and one small carrier, possibly the Ryujo, were severely damaged by bombs. Hits were also claimed on a battleship and severalcruisers.  There appears to have been no contact between surface forces.The loss of one destroyer and damage to a small aircraft-carrier is admitted by the Japanese.
New Guinea.6. The Japanese are reported to have landed at Fona, south-east of Buna,from seven barges on the 24th. The barges left later under the escort of a light cruiser.Gilbert Islands.Ocean Island, to the westward of the Gilbert Islands, was shelled by anenemy cruiser and bombed by nine aircraft on the 22nd. Nauru, farther to the westward, was shelled by a 6-inch cruiser on the same day.A leutian Islands.An unidentified Japanese cruiser, or destroyer, was sunk by a United Statessubmarine on the 14th.Anti-Submarine Operations,7. Twenty-six attacks have been carried out by aircraft: ten in the N.W.Approaches, ten in the West Atlantic, two in the South Atlantic, three in theMediterranean and one in the Indian Ocean. Of these, promising attacks weremade by our aircraft south of Iceland (C), in the Levant and off Trinidad andby U.S.A. aircraft in the Caribbean, off French Guiana and off the east coast ofBrazil.Nine attacks were made by surface craft: four in the West Atlantic, one in the N.W. Approaches, one south-West of Freetown, two south-east of the azores and one in the South Atlantic. In no case was there definite evidence of destruction.Enemy Intelligence.German.8. The cruiser Koln has been sighted at Narvik and the scharnhorst has arrived at Gdynia. Otherwise there have been no important changes in the disposition of main units, except that the pocket-battleship Scheer was not seen by air reconnaissance on the 23rd at Narvik.Italian.9. There has been comparatively little traffic from Italy to North Africaduring the week and this was to Tobruk. Coastal traffic in lighters from Tobrukto Mersa Matruh has been heavier than of late.Japan.10. Large naval reinforcements have reached the South-Western Pacific.The Japanese forces.in the area are now estimated to total two, possibly four,battleships, three aircraft carriers, 12 heavy cruisers, seven light cruisers,40 destroyers and 27 U-boats. (No allowance is made for casualties in this estimate.) The larger ships appear to keep to the north of the Solomons and tobe using bases at Bougainville Island, Buka Island, Kavieng (in New Ireland)and Rabaul.U-boats.11. Upwards of 80 U-boats are believed to be now operating in the Atlantic.Ten or more have passed north of Scotland outward bound during the week.There is increased activity on the convoy routes to the South Atlantic; but it isprobable that most of the U-boats reported are on passage to patrol areas eitheroff Freetown or north of Guiana. There have been no attacks on shipping off theU.S.A. eastern seaboard, although two or three U-boats are known to be workingoff the coast. The attack on the outward-bound convoy in mid-Atlantic wascarried out by a concentration of at least six U-boats.Raider Activity.12. The &quot; Altmark &quot; class tanker, wThich was attacked by aircraft whenoutward-bound on the 19th, as reported in last week&apos;s Resume, has now returnedto a French port.[24274] b &apos;
Protection of Seaborne Trade.13. During the week ending the 23rd/24th August 995 ships have beenconvoyed. Of these, 235 were in ocean convoys and 760 in British coastal convoys. One anti-aircraft ship, 1 armed merchant cruiser, 57 destroyers(including 2 U.S.A. destroyers) and 81 sloops, cutters and corvettes (including2 U.S.A. cutters) were employed on escort duty.During the week 109 ships in four ocean convoys arrived in Home Waterswith the loss of two ships, one of which was a straggler.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 22nd August totalled 614,000 tons, compared with 574,000 tons duringthe previous seven days, and an average of 674,000 tons for the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports, 209,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.During the month of July imports into the United Kingdom totalled2,208,500 tons, of which 41,600 tons were from Eire. Imports under the Ministryof Food totalled 996,600 tons, under the Ministry of Supply 1,128,200 tons, andunder the Board of Trade 83,700 tons.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.14. During the week ten ships have been reported attacked by U-boats, andof these six are known to have sunk. Five ships in an outward-bound convoy to canada were torpedoed 600 miles east of Newfoundland. One ship was sunk off Freetown and another off Bahia. Two ships sailing independently were attacked in mid-Atlantic, and one ship was torpedoed south-east of the Azores.One ship was mined off Lowestoft and subsequently beached.One ship was bombed by a flying-boat in Vizagapatam Harbour.British Minelaying.15.&apos;&quot; Mines have been laid by surface craft in the Denmark Strait. Aircraftlaid mines in the Baltic, off the Frisian Islands and in the Bay of Biscay.Enemy Minelaying.   British Minesweeping.16. There has been a considerable amount of minelaying by E- and R-boatsduring the week. It is believed that, on the night of 23rd/24th, in spite of theaction with our light forces, the, enemy craft laid mines in the Dover Strait.E-boats are thought to have laid mines in the East Coast War Channel on thefollowing day.   There has been little or no minelaying by aircraft.Fifty-six mines have been destroyed : mainly off Lowestoft, off Brighton andin Lyme Bay.The mine totals now are : 1,316 acoustic, 2,596 magnetic and 1,512 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.17. It is estimated that in Scandinavian waters there are 422 Danish ships,totalling 415,764 tons, available to the enemy, in addition to seven tankers,totalling 17,185 tons. A number of the Diesel-engined ships have been laid up for lack of fuel; but, of the remainder, many have been employed in transportingcoal and iron to and from enemy ports.Enemy shipping at Las Palmas, Canaries, includes two German, two italian and four Danish ships, totalling 34,009 tons.In Brazilian ports there are four ex-German ships, totalling 30,145 tons, andeleven ex-Italian ships, totalling 56,251 tons. All of these had previously beentaken over by the Brazilian Government.Vichy Merchant Shipping.18 The sailings of Vichy ships between New York and Morocco have been resumed and the lie D&apos;Ouessant (6,187 tons and the lie de Noirmoutter (5,7(MSSPfilt Curagao for Casablanca on the 9th. The lie de Re (5,104 tons) andthe Aldebaran (5,267 tons) have started on the return journey to the UnitedStates with a mixed cargo.
MILITARY SITUATION.(A map showing operations in Russia is included in the Resume as an inset.)The Russo-German Campaign.Northern and Central Sectors.19. The Russians continue to attack German positions at various pointsfrom Leningrad southwards to Voronezh. No substantial progress has been achieved. *Voronezh Sector.20. The Germans retain their bridgehead across the Don at Voronezh and russian efforts to dislodge them appear to have abated. South of Voronezh theRussians have attempted to cross over the Don to the west, but there are no reports of any real progress.Stalingrad Sector.21. The Germans are reported to be in possession of the greater part of thenorth-east corner of the Don bend, though the Russians still have a margin of territory there and continue to resist strongly. North-west of Stalingrad,probably in the area of Ostrovskie -a point at which the Don runs close to therailway Moscow-Stalingrad the Germans have crossed the river in force and.seem to have extended their bridgehead a considerable distance eastwards. Theyhave also made progress in their attack towards Stalingrad from the south-west after having been held for about a fortnight and are now within 25 miles of thetown.Caucaszcs Sector.22.   In Caucasia the Germans have gained ground in three main areas : (i) In their thrust south-east from the area of the River Manich, they havereached the Middle Kuma River and are within 75 miles of therailway Astrakhan-Kizlyar.(ii) From Pyatigorsk they have continued their advance along the general line of the railway Rostov-Baku and have reached an area some 75miles from Grozni. In an offshoot of this advance, up the course ofthe River Kuban through the Caucasus range, small German forces have succeeded, in crossing the Klukhor and Chiper Azau passes.(iii) In the area of the Lower Kuban,  they have overcome russian resistance at Krasnodar, have advanced some distance southwardstowards Tuapse, and in a parallel movement farther to the west havepenetrated, to within 15 miles of Novorossisk.Summary.23. Russian action in harassing the German forces in the northern and central sectors as well as southwards of Voronezh, has produced no appreciableterritorial change. Against the important strategical centre of Stalingrad theGermans have made considerable progress in a concentric attack from thenorth-west and the south. The position here must be considered serious. InCaucasia the Germans continue their advance, though at a slightly reduced rate, and are in possession of the greater part of the territory lying north ofthe Caucasus range. It remains to be seen what attempts they may make to passin force over the mountains before the snows render them impassable in thelatter half of October. The possible strength of Russian resistance is also an unknown factor.Egypt,24. During daylight on the 19th August the enemy displayed increasedactivity in the northern sector. There was some heavy enemy shelling on thesouthern end of the front. During the night 24th/25th enemy mechanical transport movement was observed and engaged by artillery fire.On the night of the 25th/26th a most successful raid was carried outby New Zealand troops on -the El Mereir depression, some 15 miles south-west of El Alamein. The enemy were taken completely by surprise and many ofthem were killed; 33 prisoners weie taken.[24274] &apos; &quot; .    b 2
AIR SITUATION.General Review.30.   Aircraft of Bomber Command attacked the Frankfurt area.Successful attacks were made on enemy shipping in the Mediterranean.United Kingdom.31. Fighter Command flew 992 defensive sorties by day (including 100 by .S.A. aircraft), and 405 by night.Fifty-three enemy aircraft flew over this country by day compared with87 last week, and 70 by night compared with 60,Nine were destroyed (including two by A.A. guns), three were probably destroyed, and six were damaged.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.32. Fighter and Bomber Commands despatched 1,109 and 11 offensive sorties respectively, compared with 3,357 and 197 last week. Thirty-six bomber and 110 offensive fighter sorties were flown by aircraft of the U.S.A.A.C.A high-level attack on the railway centre at Amiens-Longeau and anotheragainst shipbuilding yards at Le Trait were made by U.S.A. Fortresses, which,in each instance, dropped about 25 tons of bombs. Escorts to these operations and diversionary sweeps involved 47 fighter squadron sorties, including threeby the U.S.A.A.C. Our fighters, two of which are missing, shot down two enemy aircraft, three more were probably destroyed and six were damaged.India-Burma.25. A parachute detachment was dropped in Myitkyina area (UpperBurma) on the 4th July. After six weeks&apos; silence, owing to a wireless break-down, they reached Fort Hertz and signalled the dispositions of about 3,000Japanese occupying widely separated outposts in this area.South Pacific.26. The United States forces on Florida and Guadalcanal Islands in thesouth-east Solomons have been counter-attacked by a considerable Japanese force.Intelligence.France and the Low Countries.27. There are indications that the 2nd Panzer Division has arrived inFrance and that the 10th Panzer Division may have left. &quot; There have also beenreports of westward movement of troops from Russia and of arrivals in France,which suggest a possible increase of two or three infantry divisions. In theabsence of confirmation of these transfers, however, the estimate of divisionsremains unchanged at 28 in France and three in the Low Countries.Far East.China.28.- In the Chekiang-Kiangsi area the Chinese have regained control overa stretch of about 80 miles of the railway, but the Japanese still hold the westernextremity. The town of Linchwan, south of Nanchang, is now reported to be inChinese hands. These Chinese advances appear due to a decrease of Japaneseeffort and there is no indication at present that large-scale Chinese offensive operations are in progress.New Britain.29. There are believed to be the equivalent of two and probably threeJapanese divisions based on New Britain which are engaged in operations, bothin New Guinea and the Solomons.
Effective low-level attacks were carried out in Belgium and France bySpitfires, four of which did not return; locomotives, barges and a factory were hit and enemy personnel were machine-gunned.Mosquitos and Wellingtons, operating singly, dropped bombs on docks atEmden, aerodromes at Sylt and Texel and on a building at Stolberg (Cologne),believed to be a power house.Aircraft of the Photographic Eeconnaissance Unit flew 47 sorties. Afurther 35 sorties were flown by aircraft of Army Co-operation Command.Night.33. Totals of 196 tons of H.E. bombs and 254 tons of incendiaries were dropped during the week. Bomber Command despatched 230 aircraft on one night against Frankfurt and objectives in the Rhineland and France. Weatherprevented further attacks on land targets.A total of 170 aircraft dropped 167 tons of H.E. bombs and 224 tons ofincendiaries during the raid on Frankfurt, under conditions of heavy cloud which prevented identification of the aiming-points. Fires were seen over a wide area,but some crews reported a concentration of fires in the city. (See Appendix VII.)Sixteen bombers were lost and one crashed. Bombs were also dropped at Bingen,Kreuznach, Moyen and other targets. Lysanders successfully attacked trains inNorthern France.Thirty-four &quot; intruders &quot; were despatched to France, Belgium and Holland,,and eleven aircraft released leaflets over occupied territory.Coastal Operations.34.&apos; Coastal Command despatched 531 sorties, of which 60 were on convoy-escort. Bomber Command aircraft carried out anti-U-boat patrols in the Bay of biscay involving 50 sorties, from which three aircraft are missing. fighter command flew 630 shipping protection sorties (including six by the US.A.A.C.)and 16 against enemy shipping.Hudsons bombed and hit a 3,000-ton vessel off Borkum, and probably hittwo other ships in the same convoy. Other Hudsons reported a hit on a 2,500-tonvessel off the Frisian Islands and probable hits on another. A Hurricane bomberset fire to an E-boat off the French coast.At La Pallice, a tanker was attacked by seven Wellingtons; bombs burst onthe Mole close to the target.Sixty-six aircraft of Bomber Command laid 134 sea-mines in enemy waters.Mediterranean.Egypt and Libya.35. Our air operations were on a smaller scale, owing to the prevalence ofsand-storms. In the week ending 24th August our aircraft flew 970 sorties,compared with 1,210 in the previous week.Enemy M.T., tanks, tank workshops, landing grounds, camps, and other military targets were continuously attacked by light and fighter bombers by day,and by Naval Albacores, medium and light bombers by night. Many vehicles were destroyed or damaged, and heavy casualties were inflicted on lorry-borneGerman troops between Mersa Matruh and Bardia.Our fighters carried out a large number of reconnaissances and offensive patrols over the battle front and of shipping protection sorties off the Delta andin the Gulf of Suez.Tobruk was heavily attacked on five nights by Halifaxes, British and U.S:A.Liberators, &quot;Wellingtons and U.S.A. Mitchells (B. 25&apos;s). Liberators also madea dusk attack. At least three ships were hit, some small craft were sunk andjetties and petrol dumps were also hit.Shipping at Mersa Matruh was bombed by Wellingtons and Naval Albacores.One F-boat was set on fire and others were damaged.On two nights enemy long-range bombers operating from Crete attackedaerodromes and landing grounds in the area south of Alexandria. One of our aircraft was destroyed on the ground and a few were damaged. Two enemy bombers were destroyed by our night fighters.
Malta.*36. Only a small number of aircraft bombed the Island. Other bombersapproached, but dropped their bombs in the sea when intercepted by our fighters.Small formations of fighters, consisting of Me. 109&apos;s and Italian fighters, crossed the coast at great height, but many others turned back before making landfall.Four enemy aircraft were destroyed, two were probably destroyed and two were damaged.   We lost three Spitfires.Sicily.37. Spitfires carried out several offensive sweeps over Southern Sicilyduring the week, but there was no reaction from enemy aircraft. Hurricanes,escorted by Spitfires, bombed Biscari aerodrome and military buildings nearGela. Beaufighters attacked the flying-boat station and a merchant vessel atMarsala.Greece, Crete and Rhodes.38. Wellingtons bombed Maleme, Heraklion and Pediada Kastelli aero-dromes in Crete and Maritza aerodrome in Rhodes. British and . TJ.S.A.Liberators bombed the Corinth Canal.Sea Communications.39. A convoy consisting of an 8,000-ton tanker, a 1,000-ton merchant vesseland four destroyers escorted by aircraft was attacked by Beauforts andBeaufighters off Cape Spartivento on the 20th and off Corfu on the 21st. the tanker was hit by three torpedoes and two bombs. Photographs taken later bya Baltimore showed the tanker to be stationary with oil flowing from her. two destroyers were hit by bombs. The Beaufighters destroyed at least five of theescorting aircraft.  Six of our aircraft are missing and seven were damaged.A tanker and two destroyers escorted by Ju. 88s were attacked by Beaufortsand Beaufighters south of Corfu on the 24th. The tanker was hit by a torpedoand the destroyers by cannon and machine-gun fire. On the following night the tanker, which was then beached, was attacked by Wellingtons, which set fire tothe oil surrounding the vessel.British and TJ.S.A. Liberators made two attacks on a southbound convoyconsisting of a tanker, two merchant vessels and a destroyer 125 miles N.N.E.of Tobruk.   The two merchant vessels were hit with bombs.Another southbound convoy 75 miles north of Tobruk was attacked with torpedoes and bombs, and hits were estimated on a merchant vessel and a destroyer.Naval Swordfish bombed five F-boats off Sidi Barrani.
