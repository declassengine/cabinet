COMBINED  OPERATION.On the night of the 2nd/3rd September theCasquets lighthouse was raidedby a small-scale raiding party of two officers and ten men of the Special ServiceBrigade in M.T.B. 344. Complete surprise was effected and seven German &quot;naval personnel were taken prisoner.naval SITUATION.General Review.2.   There have been no outstanding events at sea during the week.Shipping losses have been considerable. Losses have occurred in oceanconvoys from Freetown and Canada and in West Atlantic convoys in the carribbean and Gulf of St. Lawrence.Home Waters.3. On the 29th, two M.Ls. off Folkestone were damaged by two enemy aircraft, one of which was probably hit.On the 31st a Dutch motor fishing vessel surrendered to one of our fishingtrawlers and was sent into Hartlepool under armed guard.A U.S.A. troop convoy, escorted by U.S.A. warships, arrived in Home Waterson the 31st.Northern Waters.4. On the 27th an enemy raider shelled Dikson Harbour (east coast ofNova Zembla) and damaged the Guardship, - one merchant ship and theW.T. Station. On the following day a U-boat shelled Hodavariha Lighthouse(south of Nova Zembla).   There was a heavy air raid on Archangel on the 31st.Mediterranean.5. Early on the 29th H.M. Destroyers Eridge, Croome and Hursley, inco-operation with naval aircraft, bombarded the El Daba area. Eridge wasdisabled by a one-man torpedo boat and was subsequently towed into Alexandriawith ten casualties. Hursley was slightly damaged by air attack. The torpedo boat was probably sunk by gunfire and an E-boat was destroyed by naval aircraft.On the 31st, H.M. Submarine Rorqual probably sank a 4,000-ton merchant ship&apos;off the west coast of Greece.Naval aircraft in Egypt have continued their nightly bombing raids on enemy landing grounds, tanks and M.T. in the battle area. *During the week, 23,352 tons of French merchant shipping westbound and.13,624 tons eastbound have passed Gibraltar under escort.Pacific.Solomon Islands.6. Japanese surface forces were reported to have withdrawn from the Tulagiarea on the 27th, since when there has been no further action in the sea battle offthe Solomons.On the 27th U.S.A. patrol craft sighted four Japanese destroyers believed to be taking supplies and equipment for enemy units operating on Santa IsabelIsland.Gilbert Islands.7. There has been no communication with Nauru or Ocean Islands since the25th and 26th August respectively, and it is possible that both islands have been occupied by the Japanese. It is probable that Apamama was taken by the enemy on the 1st September.Anti-Submarine Operations.8. H.M. Canadian Corvette Oakville sank a U-boat (probably U-94) on the28th east of Jamaica. Twenty-six prisoners were captured. . On the2nd September one of our aircraft attacked an Italian U-boat in &quot;the&quot;Bay of biscay. Photographs show the U-boat on her beam ends with the crew in thewater.
Eleven attacks were carried out by the escorts of an outward-bound convoywhich was attacked by U-boats east of Newfoundland between the 23rd and 25th.Of these, attacks by H.M. Destroyer Viscount and the Norwegian CorvettePotentilla may have damaged four U-boats.A Hudson aircraft operating from Trinidad possibly damaged a U-boatbetween Trinidad and Barbados.There have been 28 other attacks reported; 10 by surface craft and 18 by aircraft, but in no case has there been evidence of destruction. Two of these attacks were carried out by Brazilian units.Enemy Intelligence.German.9. The Pocket Battleship Admiral Scheer is believed to have been operating in Arctic waters, but was reported in the Tromso area on the 30th. .Italian.10. A recent reconnaissance of Taranto has reported that a third LittorioClass battleship is in port.Photographic reconnaissance of Tobruk Harbour on the 30th showed54 E-boats present.Japanese.11. The thrfee new Japanese battleships carrying 16-inch guns are reportedto have joined the four kong Class battleships in the Mandated Islands area.U-boats.12. During the week, U-boats have been operating on the convoy routesfrom Canada and Freetown. Activity is also reported from the Belle Isle Straits,and in the Caribbean off the coast of Haiti.A U-boat was sighted off Berbera on the 24th.As many as ten Japanese U-boats may be operating in the Coral Sea.Protection of Seaborne Trade.13. During the week ending the 30th/31st August, 1,070 ships have beenconvoyed. Of these, 216 were in ocean convoys and 854 in British coastal convoys.One anti-aircraft ship, one ocean-boarding vessel, 61 destroyers (including threeU.S.A. destroyers) and 87 sloops, cutters and corvettes (including three U.S.A.cutters) were employed on escort duty.During the week, 106 ships in four ocean convoys arrived in Home Waterswith the loss of four ships.14. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending 30th August totalled 670,000 tons compared with 614,000 tons duringthe previous seven&apos; days, and an average of 664,000 tons for the past 10 weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports, 166,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.15. Sixteen ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boats during theweek; of these, ten are known to have sunk. Two ships in a convoy fromFreetown were sunk off the coast of Portugal and two ships in convoy from canada were sunk in the N.W. Approaches. Three ships in a W. atlantic convoy to Greenland were torpedoed in the Belle Isle Straits and four ships, twoof which were in convoy, were sunk in the Caribbean. A U.S.A; tanker was torpedoed north of the Azores and two British ships were attacked in the gulf of Guinea and off Port Moresby, New Guinea, respectively. Two ships were torpedoed south of Lisbon.One ship was damaged by aircraft attack off Falmouth.16, Provisional reports received up to the 30th August show that 94 ships totalling 527,000 tons were sunk by enemy action during the month of August.Apart from the losses incurred in the Malta convoy, almost all the losses have occurred in the Atlantic from U-boat attacks.British Minelaying.17.   Mines have been laid by surface craft in the Faroes-Iceland (C) barrage.Minelaying by aircraft has been carried out on a small scale in the Balticand off the Frisian Islands.[24284] . &apos;*&apos; B -
Enemy Minelaying.   British Minesweeping.18. E-boats were active off the Suffolk coast on the night of the 30th,and enemy minelaying has also been reported&quot; in the Channel off the french coast. Minelaying by aircraft, on a small scale, has been carried out in the thames Estuary and possibly between the Tyne and Tees and south ofFlamborough Head. Seven moored mines have been destroyed in Lyme bay and a similar number in the Lowestoft area. Mines have also been destroyedoff Brighton and to the south-west of Dungeness.The mine totals are : 1,316 acoustic, 2,612 magnetic and 1,590 moored.19. On the 27th, enemy aircraft dropped mines in the Dvina Estuary andin the approaches to Molotovsk. It was reported on the 29th that Molotovskand Archangel were closed on account of enemy minelaying. Up to the 8thAugust, 361 mines have been accounted for in the vicinity of Malta.vichy Merchant Shipping.20. The tanker Merope (7,011 tons) now at Tampico has been attached bythe&quot; Mexican Government.The lie D&apos;Ouessant (6,187 tons) and the lie cle Noirmoutier (5,703 tons)reached Casablanca on the 27th from New York.Turkish Merchant Shipping.21. The Turkish Mercantile Marine at present consists of the followingships :-Twenty passenger ships (eleven of them over 1,000 tons) totalling35,079 tons.Twenty-eight passenger-cargo ships (twenty over 1,000 tons) totalling54,242 tons..&apos; Forty-six cargo ships (twenty-eight over 1,000 tons) totalling 74,669 tons.This makes a grand total of 94 ships of 163,990 tons. The machinery inmost of the ships is reported to be in fair or good condition, but 56 of the vessels are in need of a good deal of refitting and 66 of them require W/T sets.-Allied Intelligence.Russian.22. In the Black Sea Russian naval aircraft have carried out a series of attacks on landing craft in enemy occupied ports. On the 27th it was reportedthat a force of cruisers had bombarded Theodosia.Brazilian.23. One Brazilian cruiser and six minesweepers at Pernambuco have beenplaced at the disposal of the United States naval commander in this area.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.(An outline map showing operations in South Russia is included as an insetin this Resume.)Northern Sector.24. There have been local Russian attacks in the Leningrad area, possiblyagainst Schlusselburg, but the. outcome is not yet known.Central Sector.25. The Russians continue to attack strongly south of Rzhev. They claimto have made a 30 mile advance on a 75 mile front and to have inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy.Stalingrad Sector..26. There has been no change in the situation at Voronezh. The Russiansstill hold the north-east corner of the Don bend, where they have maintained a
fierce. resistance in the face of German pressure. The danger to Stalingrad,however, has increased. From the German bridgehead over the Don in the areaof Ostrovskie enemy troops are approaching the Volga north-east of Stalingrad.German forces which crossed the Don near Kalach have made progress and arethreatening Stalingrad from the west; while their advance from the south-westhas continued at a reduced pace. The Russians are strongly resisting all of theGerman thrusts.Caucasus Sector.27. The enemy&apos;s eastern advance towards the Caspian has continued. north of the River Kuma enemy troops have reached a point some 45 miles from the caspian, and, further south, other forces moving along the north bank of theRiver Terek have advanced beyond Mozdok. German mountain troops are movingsouth by various passes of the Western Caucasus towards the Black Sea. Inmost cases these are only small detachments, but the force advancing through theKlukhor Pass is, considering the difficult terrain, a fairly strong one. It ismeeting with Russian resistance. The Russians have also succeeded in holdingthe German drive towards Tuapse, but the danger to Novorossisk has increased,and the Germans claim to have taken Anapa, the port further north.Summary.28. The Russian attacks in the Northern and Central Sectors do not seemto have affected the general strategical situation.The position at Stalingrad is serious, but the Russians are fightingstubbornly and are counter-attacking.The enemy has made most progress in his advance, eastwards towards the caspian and Grozny, and it would seem that Russian resistance has been lessstrong in this area. The German attempt to force the passes through the WesternCaucasus may become serious and constitutes a potential threat to Sukhum.Egypt.29. Activity during the week until the night 30th/31st August was confined to patrolling on both sides. During the 29th, slightly increased enemy activity in the southern sector was reported.Early on the morning of the 31st, German forces, including armoured units,pushed forward against the southern flank of the 8th Army. They were engagedby our light forces. At 1700 hours, the foremost enemy tanks were halted a fewmiles east of Qaret el Khadim. A weak enemy thrust made previously against our main front was repulsed with loss to the enemy. On the 1st September, theenemy columns on our southern flank swung northwards towards the centralsector of our front. In spite of repeated attacks by their armoured units, theyonly made progress by skirting our strong points and concentrations and havebeen held wherever they have made direct attacks. The head of the main enemycolumn reached Alem el Bueib, while the tail was attacked by our troops fromthe south. During the evening, the enemy appeared to be forming up for anattack with tanks on one of our armoured formations, but the attack did. not materialise. It seems that the enemy was tapping in along the front to test our strength.In the northern sector from which there is little to report, our troops madea successful minor raid, taking 100 German prisoners.The general situation on the 2nd showed no material change, but themain enemy columns are reported to have drawn back into the area five to seven miles south of Alem el Haifa. Throughout the day, a large concentration of M.T. was observed in this area .and was continually harassed by air attacks and artillery. Our mobile forces operating on a general line north-east and.westwards from Samaket Gaballa have been particularly active and claim tohave destroyed many enemy M.T. vehicles.Far East.New Guinea.30. On the 25th August Japanese forces landed in the Milne Bay area(eastern extremity of New Guinea), and reinforcements were probably landed onthe night of the 26th/27th August; the total Japanese force involved is estimatedat 5,000 to 6,000.[24284] . r b 2
Australian counter-attacks seem to have compelled the bulk of the enemy forces to re-embark on night the 29th/30th, and on the 31st the situation was reported to be well in hand. Mopping-up operations against scattered enemyparties continue.In the Kokoda area there is strong enemy pressure..Solomon Islands.31. A communique issued on the 30th August by the United States confirmsthat all major opposition had been overcome in the islands of Guadalcanal, Tulagi,parts of Florida and three other small islands near Tulagi by the 10th August,and that mopping-up operations were continuing. The subsequent Japanesecounter-attack has been broken off, at least for the time being.China.32. The Japanese withdrawal along the Chekiang-Kiangsi railway hascontinued, and the Chinese have reoccupied a distance of rather more than200 miles between Nanchang on the west and Kinhwa on the east, both of whichplaces remain in Japanese hands. It has now been confirmed that the Chinesereoccupation of this stretch of line has been made possible by the withdrawal ofthe Japanese, and not by offensive operations of any magnitude by the Chineseforces. Two of the Japanese divisions which took part in the Chekiang operations have recently been located in the Hankow area, and on the 29th August japanese troops were operating south of Hankow.33. The Japanese may be about to undertake an operation against Changshaon the Hankow-Canton railwav. Similar offensives were launched by them in theautumn of 1939 and 1941.Intelligence.Japanese Order of Battle.34. Ten divisions are believed to have been formed in Japan in December1941, and these should now be ready for service overseas. Japanese forces in japan are now therefore estimated at sixteen divisions (in addition to garrisontroops), and the Japanese army is considered to consist of eighty-five divisions.Out of these eighty-five divisions, sixteen are in Japan, one in Sakhalin, twenty-five in Manchuria, twenty in China, eleven in the Philippines, N.E.I. andS.W. Pacific area, five in Burma, two in Malaya, four in Siam and Indo-China,and one unlocated.France and the Low Countries.35. The low-category 712th Division has now been identified in Belgium.This brings the number of divisions in the Low Countries to four and the total for France and the Low Countries to 32.AIR SITUATION.General Review.36. Aircraft of Bomber Command successfully attacked Kassel, Nuremberg,Karlsruhe and the Saar basin.In Egypt, our air forces co-operated to the maximum with our ground forces.Successful attacks were made on enemy shipping in the Mediterranean.Fighters from Malta carried out offensive operations over Sicily.United Kingdom.37. Fighter Command flew 931 defensive sorties by day and 391 by night.These included 78 day sorties by aircraft of the U.S. Army Air Corps.Fifty-three enemy aircraft flew overland by day. Some flights of considerableduration were made by one or two aircraft coming from France at a height of over35,000 feet; evidence suggests that they may be of the Ju. 86 P high-altitude type.Long-range bomber operations at night were slight and the forces usedoverland did not exceed ten aircraft.During the week eight enemy aircraft were shot down, one was probably destroyed and two were damaged.
Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.38.   Weather conditions early in the week were good and activity was considerable, but later, adverse weather intervened over North-West France.Fighter  and  Bomber Commands despatched 1,561 and 42 offensive sorties,respectively, compared with 1,109 and 11 last week.  In addition, 36 bomber and165 offensive fighter sorties were flown by the U.S.A.A.C.Abbeville/Drucat aerodrome was bombed by 11 Bostons. The same numberattacked Ostend. Results of both operations are reported in Appendix VII.A total of 30 U.S.A. Fortresses made high-level raids on shipbuilding yards at rotterdam/Schiedam, on the repair-and-maintenance aerodrome at Courtrai/Wevelghem (results of these attacks are given in Appendix VII) and on the airframe factory at Meaulte, near Albert, where hits were claimed on the target.In the course of encounters, two enemy fighters were probably destroyed and twodamaged by Fortresses.These bombing raids were escorted by fighters and a number of diversionarysweeps were carried out. Our fighters shot down seven enemy aircraft in combat,six were probably destroyed and ten damaged.   Ten of our fighters are missing.Unescorted attacks were made by Mosquitos, Bostons and Spitfires, operating from a low level, singly or in pairs, on Commes (see Appendix VII) and ten other objectives; three of our aircraft are missing and two crashed.During Air/Sea Rescue operations off the French coast, two enemy fighters were probably destroyed and four of ours were shot down.Aircraft of the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit flew 58 sorties, and afurther 39 sorties were flown by aircraft of Army Co-operation Command. Fromthese operations, three Spitfires are missing.Night.39. Bomber Command despatched 1,028 aircraft sorties against landtargets compared with 230 last week. Over 1,900 tons of bombs were released,including 4 x 8,000 lb. and 198 x 4,000 lb. The effort, which was mainlydirected against industrial centres in Germany, was aided by good weather; firesstarted by Pathfinders and the flares they dropped assisted in the successfuloperations. (Pathfinders is the name given to aircraft operating in advance ofthe main attack, their mission being to identify, illuminate and set a light to the target in order to provide an aiming mark for following aircraft.)Kassel, where the vast Henschel locomotive and aircraft works are situated,was subjected to a concentrated attack, during which 222 aircraft dropped258 tons of H.E. bombs and 255 tons of incendiaries. Numerous large fires were started in the centre of the town and near the railway station. It is believedthat the Henschel factory and the gas works were hit. In bright moonlight, flakand fighter activity over the enemy coast was intense during both the outwardand homeward flights; 30 bombers &quot;did not return and one crashed.The important Bavarian railway centre of Nuremberg, which is now a centre for armament industries, was bombed by 98 aircraft, which dropped 143 tons ofH.E. bombs and 110 tons of incendiaries. Crews reported that large areas of thetown were well alight, the target being clearly identified in visibility whichfavoured both the attacking bombers and the enemy defences. Twenty of our bombers are missing.Saarbrucken, damaged in previous raids (see Appendix VII), was attacked by 78 aircraft; about 130 tons of bombs were dropped. Reports of results areconflicting owing to ground haze; fires were started, but the majority appearto have been widely dispersed. Ten of our aircraft were lost; one enemy fighterwas shot down and- three were damaged. Three nights later, about 440* tons of bombs were dropped by 205 aircraft in the Saar basin area, the main attackfalling on Saarlautern.  Four of our aircraft did not return and two crashed.Bomber Command despatched 199 aircraft to attack Karlsruhe, an importantrailway junction, where the industries include oil, steel, aircraft and railwayworks, and which had not previously been attacked in force. Eight of our aircraft are missing and, of the remainder, 177 attacked in good visibility and dropped370 tons of bombs. Large fires were reported in the centre of the city and near the docks, and other fires were seen between Karlsruhe and Durlach. Our bombersshot down two enemy aircraft and damaged another.Lancasters, after a flight of 800 miles, dropped 17 tons of bombs at the Balticport of Gdynia, where the Aircraft-Carrier Graf Zeppelin is fitting out; owingto cloud over the target, results are not known.
Fifty-two &quot;Intruder&quot; sorties were flown against railway targets and aerodromes in enemy-occupied territory; two aircraft are missing.Coastal Operations.40. Coastal Command despatched 618 sorties, including 48 on convoy escortand 228 on anti-U-boat operations. Bomber Command carried out patrols inthe Bay of Biscay involving 37 sorties. (Results of Anti-U-boat operations are summarised under &quot; Naval Situation.&quot;) Fighter command flew 590 shippingprotection sorties and 73 anti-shipping patrols, including 14 by U.S.A.A.C.aircraft.Under heavy flak fire from shore batteries, eight Hurricane bombers of fighter Command pressed home an attack on three 1,500-ton ships and twosmaller vessels lying half a mile off Dieppe; the three larger ships and one of thesmaller vessels were severely damaged. One of the two escorting squadrons ofSpitfires followed with a low-level attack with cannon fire, registering many hitson the ships. Seven Hurricane bombers set fire to two 1,000-ton vessels offGuernsey and damaged two others.A Whitley of Coastal Command bombed a tanker at St. Nazaire; a hitamidships is confirmed by photographs. Another Whitley attacked a 10,000-tonvessel in La Pallice roads; bombs burst each side of the vessel, which is believed to have been a tanker.Four aircraft of Bomber Command laid fifteen mines in enemy waters.Air/Sea Rescue Operations.41. In Home waters, during the month of August. Air/Sea Rescueaircraft flew 120 sorties combined with 351 sorties by operational aircraft; 148marine craft and seven R.N.L.I. lifeboats were sent out or diverted.Several of the operations were carried out at a considerable distance fromthe English coast..   Every aircrew sighted by Air/Sea rescue aircraft was saved.Of the 89 forced landings reported (involving 342 personnel), 35 rescueswere effected and 114 Allied personnel were saved. In many of the remaininginstances there is no evidence that there were, in fact, any survivors. In additionfive enemy airmen were rescued.The above figures do not include the operations in connection with the combined raid on Dieppe on the 19th August, when sixteen Allied personnelwere saved. Three high-speed launches of the Air /Sea Rescue Service were lost by enemy action.Mediterranean.Egypt and Libya.42. Activity over the Western Desert battle area mounted to a scalecomparable in intensity with the peak effort of the campaign of last May and june. In the week ending 31st August our aircraft flew 1,703 sorties, comparedwith 970 in the previous week.Bombing attacks on enemy M.T. in the battle area were continued by day and by night. The weight of these attacks was greatly increasedsubsequent to the enemy&apos;s offensive against our ground forces, and onthe 2nd September bombing sorties were in excess of those ever flown inone day on this front. These raids were carried out in the areas inwhich enemy armoured forces were most active and where enemy M.T.was concentrated, and considerable damage is known to have resulted. the bombers met with heavy opposition from anti-aircraft fire and enemy fighters,but were well protected by their fighter escorts. Successful attacks were madeon enemy landing grounds, on camps, on eastbound traffic between Gambut andSidi Barrani and other military objectives. In two raids Beaufighters destroyednineteen vehicles including petrol carriers, damaged about 100 others and shot down two Ju.52s. Fighters also provided special patrols over Naval units, and shot down three enemy aircraft and probably destroyed or damaged seven others.The enemy displayed considerable activity over the battle area and manyheavily-escorted Stuka formations were intercepted by our fighters on offensive patrols. In several instances the Stukas were forced to jettison their bombs and 13 Ju. 87s and 17 fighters were shot down; 15 enemy aircraft including anumber of Ju. 87 were shot down by A.A. fire. During the same period we lost27 fighters and five bombers but eight pilots were saved.
The harbour installations and shipping at Tobruk were the targets for heavynight-bombing raids. Large fires were started along the water front and on one night two ships were hit and set on fire; many near misses were reported on other vessels.Enemy bombers, operating from Crete, carried out two intensive night attacks by 80 and 50 aircraft respectively on aerodromes south of Alexandria.Four aircraft on the ground were destroyed and ten others damaged; three enemy bombers were shot down.U.S.A. aircraft participated in these operations, and one Mitchell is missing.Sea Communications.43. On the night 26th/27th August, Wellingtons torpedoed and set on fire a southbound, tanker or large merchant vessel S.W. of Crete.The following day Beauforts and Beaufighters sank an escorted southboundvessel of 7,000 tons south of Greece. Another vessel of a similar size, N.N.W.of Apollonia was hit with a bomb and three torpedoes and left ablaze; a destroyer also was damaged.A ship in a southbound convoy N. of Derna was attacked by Wellingtons at&quot;night, and blew up and sank. Two merchant vessels approaching Tobruk were hit and. set on fire.On the 30th a large tanker, escorted by a destroyer and seven aircraft, was attacked by Beauforts and Beaufighters S.E. of Taranto and left ablaze. one enemy aircraft was destroyed and five others were probably destroyed or damaged.Wellingtons torpedoed, a vessel of 2,500 tons north of Derna on the night1st/2nd September, causing clouds of smoke. The. convoy to which this vesselbelonged was previously attacked by U.S.A. bombers which obtained a hit on another ship.   U.S.A. Liberators also made a hit on a ship at Heraklion (Crete).On the following night naval Swordfish and Albacores torpedoed a vessel of5,000 tons off Cape Spartivento. which was later reported aground. Wellingtonsmade a direct hit on a tanker of 4,000 tons near Corfu, causing a large explosionand. clouds of smoke.Malta.44.. There was very little enemy activity over Malta. Only a few inter-exceptions were made and in some instances the enemy avoided combat and turnedback before ^reaching the Island. Two enemy aircraft were destroyed and atleast five damaged.  Two Spitfires were lost.Sicily.45. Spitfires from Malta flew offensive reconnaissances over Sicily in daylight and Beaufighters carried out &quot; Intruder &quot; patr ols at night.A successful attack was made on the aerodromes at Comiso, Biscari and Gela.About 30 Spitfires made a sweep over the area while 22 others carried out a low-level attack. Barracks, dispersal areas, gun posts, fuel tanks were shot up and casualties inflicted on aerodrome personnel. Six enemy aircraft were shot down,three others probably destroyed and one damaged. On the ground seven aircraft were destroyed and eleven others were probably destroyed or damaged. On thereturn journey three schooners were attacked with cannon and machine-gun fire.Burma.46. U.S.A. medium bombers, based in China, bombed Lashio. No airopposition was encountered, though nine Japanese fighters were seen on the aero-drome; two of these were destroyed and two more probably destroyed. Duringanother attack runways, a hangar and warehouses were hit.At Myitkyina, hits were registered by Allied bombers on runways and neardispersed aircraft at the aerodrome and on barracks and the railway terminus.Mohawks and Tomahawks made small raids on Mawlaik and Mogaung.New Guinea.47. Marauders bombed enemy positions and Kittyhawks machine-gunnedbarges, stores and fuel dumps in the Milne Bay area; six enemy aircraft were shot down, four probably destroyed and another damaged.  The aircraft destroyed
included at least two dive-bombers. This type has not been used by theJapanese in the New Guinea area since January. Four more Japanese aircraft were destroyed and five damaged in the course of an Allied attack on Bunaaerodrome where, two days later, five more were severely damaged on the ground.A number of aircraft were also destroyed on Lae aerodrome. Enemy positions inthe Kokoda sector were attacked several times. Fortresses hit a transport and left it sinking.New Britain.48. Allied aircraft dropped bombs among buildings at Vunakanauaerodrome (Rabaul); two intercepting fighters were destroyed, another probably destroyed and three were damaged.Solomon Islands.49. Douglas dive-bombers attacked and sank one Japanese destroyer and severely damaged and probably sank another; a third appeared to be crippled andwas on fire.  Four Catalinas bombed Buka aerodrome.The enemy made two bombing raids on American positions on Guadalcanal,Island, causing minor damage; a total of 24 aircraft were employed and seven-are reported to have been destroyed.Australia.50. On the 27th, two small raids were made on Darwin: a Naval stores andand civil radio station were damaged. Ineffective attacks followed on the 30thand 31st. Slight damage resulted at Broome from an attack by two Japaneseseaplanes on the 26th.HOME    SECURITY    SITUATION.General.51. There has been no concentrated bombing, but widely-separated incidentshave again been reported on six days and five nights of the week. By day, the attacks were chiefly on the South and South-west coasts and on East Anglia; by night, raiding extended from the South and East coasts to the East Midlands andthe North-east Coast.Damage.52. There has been no damage of national importance. The mostoutstanding incident was at Bristol on the 28th, when 2 buses in the centre ofthe city w^ere hit and 44 people killed; house property was damaged and utilityservices affected.

The figures for non-tankers relateto the last day of the month while those for tankers relate to the 15th of the month to February 1942 and to the last day of the month from March 1942.(1) (a) Tankers on Admiralty service include vessels importing oil fuel to the United Kingdom; in July .1942 these comprised 27 tankers of 225,000 gross tons.(b) Non-tankers allocated to the fighting services which are under repair are excluded from this column.   All tankers on Admiralty service are, however, included.(c) A substantial part (in recent months nearly one-half) of the tonnage in these columns brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage (see note (3)).(2) These columns give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair. They do not,therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward voyages to the Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries other than United Kingdom and Eire.oo

Two aircrafthangars are destroyed and others damaged by blast. There are many craters tothe east and west of the north-east-south-west runway, one on the runway itself and another blocking a roadway. Twenty-seven craters, two of them on thetarmac, are seen within the north dispersal area. In addition, at least 31 bombs have fallen within the landing area.Ostend.Photographs taken during the attack on 29th August show at least ten bombsbursting on the quay between the outer harbour and the Bassin de la Marine,three or four of them being direct hits on sheds. On the quay between theBassin de la Marine and the fishing harbour eight bursts are seen and six bombs have hit the Marine Coal Depot and the quay south-east of it. In addition, onebomb has fallen in the entrance to the E/R boat pens.Rotterdam and Schiedam.Photographs taken on the 28th August show the following principal features of damage in Wilton&apos;s Shipyard resulting from the attack on the 27th August: A 250-foot vessel (probably the auxiliary minelayer Co bra) is lying on herside. The liner Noordam is listing to port and shows blast damage amidships.A large workshop in the centre of the shipyard has a big hole in its roof.Courtrai/Wevelghem.Photographs taken by U.S.A.A,F. Fortresses during the attack on the 29thshow : Twenty-five bursts on the landing ground, among personnel huts and repairsheds; four bursts across the northern servicing tarmac adjacent to whichammunition is stored; two hits on a light flak position.
Comines.On photographs taken during the attack on.the 29th August a bomb is seen to have fallen through the roof of the Switch House in the Power Station andburst on a lower floor.  Smoke is seen issuing from a lower window.Saarbrucken.In the attack on the 29th/30th July 68 passenger coaches were destroyed or damaged, together with a considerable number of goods trucks, mostly in oradjoining the goods station. A factory making parachutes was severely damaged.A newspaper report of the 19th August states that in order to repair the worst of the damage in Saarbrucken workers from many other districts have hadto be brought into the city, amongst them &quot; innumerable &quot; glaziers fromWurzburg, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, and many other towns.A miens/&apos; Longueau.Photographs taken on the 27th August show that during the U.S.A.A.F.raid on the 20th August the engine sheds and the approaches thereto have been damaged. Other hits among the sidings have dislocated several lines and thefootbridge over these appears to have been partly destroyed.Dieppe. Combined Operation: August 19.A reliable source reports that German Staff Officers have stated that theR.A.F. plan was bold and well executed, and the Germans most difficult problemof defence, in this type of raid, was the aggressiveness of the R.A.F., and theyfear that, in future, heavier bombs may be used on a larger scale. About 170aircraft are admitted to have been lost during the attack.Mainz.It is reported that 400 people were killed and many more injured.   40,000.people have been evacuated, 30,000 of whom, nearly one-third of the population,were homeless.General.In Duisburg, the raids in July are said to have upset the coal traffic fromGermany to Italy for one week.The effect of the air attacks on Bremen has created a problem for the housing authorities, especially in the case of the workers at the Focke Wulf factory, since,owing to the large area of workers&apos; dwellings which were demolished, a consider-able percentage of them have had to be housed in emergency barracks which aretotally unsuited to winter conditions.
