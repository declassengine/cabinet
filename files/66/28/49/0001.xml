THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1942.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (42) 419.September 21, 1942.WAR CABINET.ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS.Note by the Prime Minister.(i) Committee Procedure.In my Minute of March 14, 1941 (W.P. (G) (41) 34), I called attentionto the risk of overdoing Committee procedure.Ministers in charge of Departments should now once more review Committeesworking in their province with a view to dispensing with any that have fulfilledtheir purpose, framing dates for reports in appropriate cases, curtailingattendances where practicable, and toning up any procedure that has becomefaulty.In the case of inter-departmental committees this action should be initiated by the Minister to whose Department the Chairman belongs.On November 1 reports should be made showing the number of committees for which each Department is responsible, the reduction effected since this Note,and the arrangements for supervising Committee business in the Department.(ii) Liaison Arrangements.Ministers should at the same time review liaison arrangements in their departments, whether internal or with other Departments, more particularly tosee that they are elastic, informal and appropriate and whether their extensioncould render any Committee otiose.(iii) Delegation of Executive Responsibility.It has been suggested to me that, despite earlier adjurations, there is not enough delegation of responsibility with the result that senior officials oftenbecome ov erburdened with comparative detail. I wish Ministers in charge of departments, both now and at intervals hereafter, to consider this question as it affects their Departments and issue such directives or take such other action asthey find needed.The shouldering of greater responsibility by junior staffs involves someacceptance of errors resulting therefrom.W. S. C.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1.[24373]
