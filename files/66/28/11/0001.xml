3S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)S E C R E T.FUELICATION OF DOCUMENTS ILLUSTRATING THECOURSE OF ANGLO-GERMAN RELATIONS BETWEENLOCARNO AND MARCH.  1959._Memorandum &quot;by the secretary Department of Overseas Trade.I was asked to read these documents and to give my opinionojijthe question of their publication.    I have reached the fol-1owing conclusions:-1*       The German Government will undoubtedly come very badlyout of it, since it will be clear that deliberately, maliciously,and deceitfully they planned agression and domination for manyyears (indeed, a slow&quot;but perceptible deterioration in theGerman attitude begins after Locarno).2.      : The British&quot; Government will appear to have had goodintentions but to have been more concerned to temporariseand to smooth over awk.v8.rd places than to conceive and carryout a \rigorous and consistent policy,I am in favour of publication of the documents, but   towardsthe end of the war when, on the eve of peacemaking,  the press and the public may be expected to take some interest in them.If they were&quot; published now/ probably only one or&quot; two individuals in this country&quot;would both read then and write about them.   Afew others night write about them - for diverse reasons.I suggest that, in nearly every case, documents referredto in the text, but not reproduced, should be reproduced both to make the story clear and to avoid suspicion of suppression.Certain &quot;appreciations&quot; prepared in the Foreign office are included amongst the documents.    Here there has clearly hadto be careful selection but if publication is delayed to theend of the war I should imagine that this source of information and illustration might, with advantage, be more fully used.There should also be a full explanatory introduction to each volume and an index,I presume that these documents will not be&apos; published in isolation but will be accompanied by other volumes dealing withother countries.    Otherwise, much less than half the story willhe told.VI P. (48)  581.COPY36TH AUGUST, 1948aWAR CABINET.H, Jr.Department of Overseas Trade, S,W,1.,
