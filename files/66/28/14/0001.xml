THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,)b 0 R E . Tnw.p584B28th Augusta 1948,COPY no war    CABINET.PROPOSED OFFER OP H.M.S.  &quot;SHROPSHIRE&quot; TO THE royal australian NAVY,- ;io oG by the PriraeJMinister*lo     My War Cabinet colleagues will be aware that theRoyal Australian Navy has recently lost H.M.A.S. &quot;CANBERRA&quot; ,one of her last two remaining 8-inch craisers.    Thus,in thepast year the Royal Australian Navy has lost three out of the six cruisers with which they began the war.    I consider thatit might have a lasting effect on Australian sentiment if his Majesty&apos;s Government gave freely and outright to the royal australian Navy one of our similar ships.    The Admiralty are willing to offer H.M.S. &quot;SHROPSHIRE&quot; which will be availablein six months&apos; time after refit.    The exact statement of theoffer drawn up by the Admiralty is annexed.2.     I hope that my War Cabinet colleagues and theChancellor of the Exchequer will authorize me to make this offerimmediately on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, withoutcalling a formal meeting.    I should be obliged,therefore, if i could receive   their views not later than 6.0 p*m, , Friday,28th August.W.S.C.10. Downing Street, S.W.l0ANNEX.The Royal Australian Navy have lost three out o f theirsix cruisers in commission at the beginning of the war.When the SYDNEY was sunk in November 1941, theAustralian Government asked for a cruiser as a replacementsProposals were made but as the Admiralty required that the ship in question should remain under their operational oontrol thematter lapsed.If the shortage of cruisers in British areas is balancedagainst the apparent position in the American areas, there is good reason for   retaining all British construction of cruisersunder Admiralty control.NOTE; rl-The offer of H.H.S. SHROPSHIRE to tile&apos;Royal Australian Navywas -approved by the War Cabinet and made to the australian government.    A copy of the Australian Government&apos;s telegramof acceptance is attached.

On the other hand, the most serious considerationmust be given to the maintenance of the Royal AustralianNavy,    The losses the Royal Australian Navy have sustainedhave been very heavy especially in cruisers which are thebackbone of their FleetoI therefore propose that an 8&quot; cruiser of similartype to the recently lost CANBERRA should now be offered to the Royal Australian Navy, and the Admiralty recommendSHROPSHIRE, which ship is expected to complete a refit, inwhich she will be brought thoroughly up to date, in about six month* tim^0    Considering the time it will take toget together an Australian crew and send them to this country,the above arrangement should be convenientoIt is not intended to make any conditions asregards operational control,.w s c .Go27th August, 1942a
