THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 409.September 14, 1942.WAR CABINET.REPATRIATION OF CIVILIANS AND SICK AND SERIOUSLYWOUNDED PRISONERS OF WAR FROM THE BRITISHEMPIRE AND GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE possibility of an exchange of sick and seriously wounded prisoners ofwar between the British Empire and Germany is a matter which has aroused widepublic interest. It is now nearly a year since it was mentioned in any official statement, and I think that the members of the Cabinet may wash to receive an account, of our attempts to find a solution of this very difficult problem. our principal aim has been to secure, before the onset of winter, that all, or at anyrate the worst cases among the British sick and seriously wounded in german hands, should be removed from Germany.2. The breakdown in negotiations which took place last winter was followedby a &quot; cooling-off &quot; period lasting until June of this year. During that periodboth sides maintained their respective positions. Early in January the SwissForeign Minister offered to mediate on this question by inducing both sides tomake a fresh start, and we agreed that he should do so. For several months it seemed that he was unable to make any progress with the Germans, but in Junehe reported that the German Government had also agreed, all earlier communication-tions on this subject being regarded as for his information, with a view to producing a solution.3. A few days later we received a preliminary draft of a suggestedagreement from the Swiss Government, who asked whether it was generally acceptable as a basis for discussion and what observations His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment wished to offer upon it. This development seemed to offer a method of ending the existing deadlock, and with the approval of the Dominions and India the swiss Foreign Minister was informed that His Majesty&apos;s Governments acceptedthe draft as a basis for discussion and that their observations would follow indue course.4.   In the Swiss draft provision was made for the repatriation of(1) All sick and wounded, irrespective of rank or number, and of ProtectedPersonnel (R.A.M.C., chaplains, &amp;c);(2) All civilians, whether interned or not, who express the wish to be repatriated, with the exception of those who are involved in a penalaction or who are undergoing punishment, and also of those whoserepatriation is considered dangerous to the security of the detaining power.The territories covered by the proposed agreement were the British Empire onthe one hand and Germany and all territories occupied by the German forces onthe other.5.   As regards the carrying out of the agreement, the sick and wounded and Protected Personnel would be exchanged first, and the transfer would beeffected between a port in Great Britain&apos; and a port on the Continent; His11848   [243401
Majesty&apos;s Government would deliver the German personnel by hospital ship atthe Continental port to which the German Government would undertake totransfer the British personnel. Civilians would be included if places wereavailable, priority being given to women and children and men under 18 and over60 years of age.6. This draft was very carefully considered by a Repatriation Committeeon which all the departments concerned and when necessary also the Dominionsand India are represented. There are three points to which the Committee gavespecial attention. First, it will be seen that provision is made for the repatriation of civilians of military age. but that those whose repatriation is considereddangerous to the security of the detaining Power would be excluded. The GeneralStaff has waived its earlier objections to the release of German civilians of military age. provided that the exceptions mentioned in the Swiss draft are maintained.The Foreign Office has. however, also to consider whether such a concession would,or would not. make easier an agreement with the Germans. It is apparent that since the British sick and wounded greatly outnumber the German sick and wounded, and since last year Germany refused to make an exchange irrespective of numbers, the object of the Germans in linking civilians with the sick and wounded was to provide on our side enough Germans to offset this disparity in numbers. It is likely that the Germans who opt for repatriation will be foundnot among the uninterned but among the interned and, so far as the UnitedKingdom is concerned, the great majority of the latter have been transferredoverseas to one or other of the Dominions or to India. The number of Germanmen. women and children who would elect to return to Germany, and whoserepatriation is not open to objection on security grounds, is not yet known. Alsoconsiderable numbers of British civilians will have to be put into the scale on theother side. It is not. therefore, clear whether or not the disparity in numbersof sick and seriously wounded would, in fact, be offset by the inclusion of menof military, age. The Foreign Office accordingly felt bound to insist that on bothsides men of military age shall only be considered eligible if, in their view, theinclusion of this class is necessary and desirable in order to assist the negotiationswith the German Government.  This view has been accepted by the Committee.7. The other points upon which the Committee has concentrated are the need to guard against a fresh breach of faith by Germany and. further, the need tomeet the main political difficulty, which is that for reasons of prestige Hitler hasinsisted on repatriation on a head-for-head basis. It is agreed that both these points can best be met by a plan which would include the following features : (a) The gradual concentration of all persons included in the proposed agreement in a neutral country or countries;(b) During the above process and as soon as a considerable number havereached neutral territory, a first transfer of British and Germansick and wounded, and Protected Personnel and/or civilians on anumerical basis, but later transfers irrespective of numbers;(c) The inclusion in the first transfer of German sick and wounded and also some civilians in the United Kingdom, in order to make it sufficiently attractive to the Germans, combined with the retention for a later stage of the German sick and wounded in Canada, Australia and elsewhere, in order to make sure as far as possible that the GermanGovernment, which attaches importance to the sick and wounded,would complete the agreement;(d) An assurance from each of the neutral Governments concerned that theywould assume the role of stake-holders and, would not allow british or German personnel assembled in their territory to leave it exceptin accordance with the terms of the proposed agreement.^ 8. The assent of all the Dominions and of India was obtained to an attemptbeing made to reach an agreement on the above lines. It was also agreed thatall these Governments should, like the United Kingdom Government, be partiesto the proposed agreement.9. As stated in paragraph 3 above, the Swiss Government asked whatobservations His Majesty&apos;s Governments wished to offer upon their draft. Inreply, the Swiss Government were informed that the United Kingdom, theDominions and India would be parties to the proposed agreement: that, pendingan indication of the German Governments views on the Swiss draft,&quot;they expressed no opinion on the question of male civilians of military age, butaccepted the other classes of persons proposed by the Swiss Government; that
they could not accept the Swiss proposal for carrying out repatriation; and thatthey would prefer an arrangement upon the lines of the plan discussed in para-graph 7 above. These observations were communicated by the Swiss ForeignMinister to the German representative at Berne at the end of July.10. On their side the German Government, which also received the Swissdraft last June, have neither accepted it as a basis for discussion nor forwardedtheir observations. The Swiss Foreign Minister, who has been told that we can-not regard this position as satisfactory, reported a few days ago that he had madestrong representations to the German Minister in Berne, but that the mainobstacle on the German side was that Hitler had to be.,consulted on this question.He added that, if this scheme definitely fails, he would be prepared to considera proposal for the severely wounded to be sent to Switzerland as hospital cases.11. His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Berne has recommended that, if no progress is made, the Swiss Foreign Minister should be asked to warn the German Govern-ment that the Swiss Government would have to withdraw the scheme unless itwere accepted as a basis for discussion without delay.12.   We should at the present stage keep in mind two objectives : First. Not to sacrifice, unless forced to, the approach which we have already made to the Germans and in which we have gone a long way to meet their point of view;Secondly. To make use of the time between now and the onset of winter tosecure the removal from Germany of, at any rate, the worst cases amongthe sick and wounded.13. If the Swiss proposal and our observations are withdrawn at our suggestion, it will not be easy for us to revive them. There is no certainty thatthe proposal will be rejected by Hitler but it seems likely that this question willnot be submitted to him until the present large scale operations in Russia are brought to a conclusion. On the other hand, we must, unless the Germans acceptthe Swiss draft without delay, concentrate upon the second objective, and inorder to do so we must resume complete liberty of action.14. This view has been endorsed by the Repatriation Committee, and the swiss Government has now been asked to inform the German Government that&apos;unless they accept the Swiss draft without delay as a basis for discussion. HisMajesty&apos;s Governments will no longer regard themselves as bound by their acceptance and comments upon the scheme, and will resume complete liberty ofaction. His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Berne has, at the same time, been instructedto ascertain whether the new proposal for internment in Switzerland is intendedto include all prisoners of war passed by the Mixed Medical Commission. Assoon as his reply is received the best way of applying this proposal to both Britishand German sick and wounded will be examined.A. E.September 14, 1942.
