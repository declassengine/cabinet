August 28, -\$k2WAR CABHIETREPORT PIT Has OPPIIOKIfemorandum by the janister of ^Ii-u^qrmatiqnThe period under review has &quot;been marked by continuous and increasing disquietabout the Russian position.   Although sympathy and admiration for the Eussianpeople remain great, the possibilities of a Russian collapse are now very much inpeople1 s minds,This sense of disquiet lias, of course, maintained the desire for a second front in Europe, although there is nothing in the nature of an agitation for this front to be opened immediately.   The hard realities of our position have, sunk in.But people are restless and unhappy at the spectacle of the Germans advancing inRussia, while we appear powerless to interveneJ and it is rather that they longto be told that the time has come for the Second Front to be opened than that theyurgently demand its opening.Amongst many people there is a refusal to take a mental interest in the war^and tliis is not at all inconsistent with their being actively engaged in war work.There is ample evidence, however, of a fairly widespread decay of interest in warnews, a reduction of listening to the 3.B.C, and an avowed inability to follow&apos;what is going on.   No doubt people are longing for good news, and when they do not get it they tend to dissociate their minds from news altogether,&apos;Professions of readiness for further sacrifices are still very common.   this feeling probably, contributes to the high spirit with which German air raids are met by the people in the areas affected.   Though it is widely expected that the weightof German air attacks will be intensified this Winter, they do not appear to beanticipated with alarm or forebodings   (Tills confidence is no doubt based in part ona belief that we are now much better prepared for active and passive defence than to were in previous years) *   Even the regular egressions of grateful approval withvhich food rationing and distribution are received by the public seem a littleembarrassed and shamefaced, and it is possible to detect a feeling that further restrictions would be accepted almost with relief,&quot;Holidays at home&quot; have been a constant topic   This subject has been taken and fixed upon by the public as a typical example of Government muddle.   Reasonableexplanations as to the Government&apos;s share in the matter and as to the impossibility of any detailed system of rationing travel failed, at any rate, in the -earlier weeks,to mitigate the publio irritation.   It may be useful to record two deductions fromthis;    (a)    In its present mood the public attributes to Government action or   -inaction all the main incidents that affect its daily life and does not seriouslyattend to distinctions between various forms of responsibility.   If things seem to&apos; 60 right, the Government is praised: if they seem to go wrong the Government isthought to be run by incompetent people,   (b)   If appeals are used and things stillappear to be wrong, there is a regular hostile reaction on the lines &quot;Why can&apos;t&quot;khey say what they want, and then order everyone to do it instead of appealing to people to do things&quot;?The War Cabinet is aware of the special problem in international relationscreated by the arrival of large scale American forces in this country.   It is early*o speak, but I am glad to say that on the whole, reports of the British reaction totheir visitors axe genuinely favourable.   Reports agree as to the fine type of man^presented in the American forces,   I hopo that the Americans and the public willIS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAIailC MAJESTY&apos; S government^EIIIg &apos;/ ^SECRET COPY HQ        2 9V/.P.

not &quot;be made self-conscious &quot;by too many - people diagnosing dif ferences in nationalcharacter&apos; and prescribing how they should he surmounted.   The main &quot;headache&quot; isthe. very great disparity in the pay of the respective forces, which reacts &quot;both onthe British soldiers and on the civilian population.There is practically no sign of disunity in the public reaction to events inIndia, &quot;but on the contrary solid support for the action of the authorities inarresting Gandhi and his followers and in taking firm action to repress riotingand sabotage.   It may he that this is in part the usual favourable response tofirm and decisive measures, and that more divergent voices will be heard if thecivil disobedience movement does not quickly subside.   But for the time beingpublic feeling seems to be all one way.
