THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  August 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 375.August 23, 1942.WAR CABINET.AIR ASSISTANCE TO CHINA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues will no doubt already have seen the telegram of the12th August from the Military Attache at Chungking which is annexed below.It emphasises the urgent importance of starting now to build up and maintain a small Allied air force in China in order to defeat any Japanese air offensive,,to defeat a land attack on Yunnan, to keep the air route to India open,and, indeed, to keep China herself in the war. Sir H. Seymour endorses theMilitary Attached views, and adds that the presence of over 300 R.A.F. groundpersonnel at Chungking and others elsewhere in China, none of whom haveanything serious to do, emphasises the lack of British aircraft.2. On the 3rd June I circulated to my Colics.^U.GS ci paper (W.P. (42) 236)warning them of the potentialities of the situation in China and of the deterioration-tion in Anglo-Chinese relations. My object in circulating the present paper is,to remind Cabinet that the Chinese situation has not improved, that there is stilla definite risk of China falling out of the war through isolation and loss ofconfidence, and that the assistance which we are able to give to China does not,,up to the present, counterbalance the help which she wants and which we areunable to afford.3. Although some very slight progress has been made towards developing the air route from India to China and establishing new means of sending supplies,via Tibet and Turkistan, the situation of China remains grave. The Chinese war-effort is largely maintained by the vitalising leadership of Chiang Kai-shek andby his success in keeping up the morale of his people. We may therefore drawsome reassurance from a personal message which he sent to Sir A. Clark Ken-last month, which included the words : &apos;&apos; China will not cease fighting before final victory is won by the United Nations.&quot; But his ability to maintain the -morale of his people depends very much on the help which he receives fromourselves and from the United States and on the evidence which we provide ofour continued close interest in, and support of, the Chinese war effort.   14. At the meeting of the Pacific Council in Washington on the 12th AugustDr. T. V. Soong, Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs, stated that bombing by united States aviation units in China (the &quot; American Air Group&quot; referredto in the annexed telegram) had been very effective and had had excellent resultsfor Chinese morale. He added later that for the maintenance of morale the most valuable step which the United Nations could take would be the despatch of .further aircraft to China.5. This is a subject on which I have been in correspondence with theSecretary of State for Air. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador has frequently stressed the need for the R.A.F. to be represented in China both from the point of viewof Anglo-Chinese relations&apos;and for the encouragement which it would give to theChinese. The situation in the Middle East has lately made it difficult to carry11831   [24255] * * b
out this recommendation. The Secretary of State for Air has informed methat an added difficulty lies in the absence of facilities in China at the presenttime even for an additional squadron. General Wavell reported at the endof June. i.e., before the reverses in Libya and Egypt, that he was anxious to operate British bombers from China and he consulted General Stilwell, theAmerican C.-in-C. at Chungking, but the latter took the view that lack ofmaterial in China made it impossible. The Air Officer Commanding-in-Chiefat New Delhi has been asked to consider sending a token force of, say, one squadron of bombers or fighters for a time, but the reply has been that althoughthe political and ultimate military advantages of such a step are fully realised,nothing can be spared at present.   General Wavell has so informed the Chinese.6. The Secretary of State for Air considers that an alternative suggestionthat an American squadron should be withdrawn from China and a Britishsquadron substituted is not likely to appeal to the United States authorities,or indeed to be administratively feasible. Sir H. Seymour also deprecates thissuggestion, though he admits that it would no doubt have a stimulating effect for the moment. The Chinese would soon realise that it meant no increaseof strength, and if we cannot add to the present small force in China he believes that it would be better that the force should be homogeneous and provided bythe American Air Force, to whom the Chinese are accustomed and in whom they have full confidence.7. I might mention that it has recently been&apos; pointed out to the ChineseAmbassador that, in so far as American aircraft have been withdrawn from india for China, this constitutes a contribution to the Chinese war effort from her Allies jointly.8. On the other hand, the Secretary of State for Air has agreed, that,in response to a recent request from Chiang Kai-shek, a small party of airinstructors should be provided for the Chinese Staff College with an AirVice-Marshal at their head.9. My colleagues will be aware that certain difficulties have arisen inconnexion with the  50-million credit which we offered to China. TheChancellor of the Exchequer and I are circulating a memorandum giving thedetails of this matter, but he will, I know, bear me out in saying that itwould be impossible for us to meet the Chinese demands in the form in whichthey have been presented to us. On the other hand, it has been nmde clear,repeatedly to the Chinese Government that this credit remains open to them on the terms which we originally offered and, indeed, that they may make full use of it in advance of the signature of a formal agreement.10. A Parliamentary goodwill mission of four members, representing bothHouses of Parliament, has been invited to China by General Chiang Kai-shek,and will, it is hoped, leave about the end of September.11. My own judgment is that we can certainly count on the continuedstaunch refusal of Chiang Kai-shek to consider terms with Japan.. But, for thereasons given above, his ability to continue to line up his country behind himdirectly depends on our demonstrating our willingness and ability to help China.In a number of small- ways we are trying to do this, but not by providing thethings for which she has particularly asked, namely, money without conditions and assistance in the air. So long as the United States can continue to give both(particularly the latter) we may hope that the situation will not suddenlydeteriorate. But supplies of all kinds within China are steadily diminishing.If United States air assistance peters out and we are still unable to help, there isa serious danger of China falling out of the war, with moral and material resultsof far-reaching gravity. &quot; .12. The conclusion to which I am forced is that, unless and until the allied nations are in a position to take the offensive against Japan on a scale which will of itself afford relief to China and free the approaches to that country, the formof assistance which it is most important that we should develop to the limits ofour capacity is the sending of air reinforcements at the earliest possible moment and to the greatest possible extent to which they can be made available.A.

Annex.- Military A attache, Chungking, to the War Office, repeatedCommander-in-Chief, India.(Urgent).0500 cipher 12th August.For Director of Military Intelligence.1. Of several possible future Japanese moves attack on Kunming from twodirections is clearly a likely starter. Even a sustained air offensive aftermonsoon intended disrupt the present tenuous air supply route would inevitablyhave most serious effect on resistance. Only present means defeating such air offensive is very small American air group. Japanese already making efforts onconsiderable scale, to wipe this out. In spite of outstanding successes, since, so for as known here, there is no (? prospect of) any replacement, let alone reinforc-ment, for this gallant little force, its doom would appear sealed.2. Under present conditions the only material Allied assistance which canbe brought to bear in- this theatre is an air force supplied and maintained (? by air). Political advantages operating small British air force have been constantlyreiterated. The size such an air force which could achieve worth while militaryresult would (? appear) negligible in comparison air forces in use elsewhere, andmight well make difference between keeping China in war or letting her makeseparate peace. Commanding Officer of United States air group has stated 150(? fighters) and 50 bombers would enable him to defeat land attack on (? Yunnan)and keep air route to India open. At present he has barely 10 per cent, of(? that).3. If it is Allied intention to use China one day as base for attack on Japan(,? proper) (I cannot) stress too (% urgently) (importance) starting now to buildup and (? maintain) small Allied air force here. This will at least indicate toChinese that we regard this theatre as of some (? importance) which at presentthey see no reason to believe.4.   Biit (? time) presses.
