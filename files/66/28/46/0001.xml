THE Joint War Production Staff reported in May last (D.C. (S) (42) 48)that the production programmes for 1942 were, in the main, feasible within theresources likely to be available.2. In the intervening three months, there have been certain adverse changes and. if the 1942 position were to be re-examined now. the verdict might have to beless favourable.3. In 1943, the demands made upon our productive resources wilhbe largerin respect of the Navy and the Air Force and probably no smaller for the Army.There are also the onerous Bolero commitments.4. In general, plant capacity and machine tools will not be the limitingfactors.5. The supply of raw materials depends partly on shipping, partly onavailability at the point of origin. On the shipping side, there may be enoughtonnage to make raw materials available at the 1942 rate of consumption; butthis is the upper limit of the probabilities. Some raw materials, such asrubber and magnesium, are certain to be in short supply, and the developmentof events in the United States may be such as to endanger British allocations of others, such as steel and copper. On balance, it seems unlikely that all rawmaterials will be available in the necessary volume.6. Man-power will present an even more serious problem. Last April theproportion of the total adult population in the services and in the munition industries together was already higher than at the peak of the last war. Butthe further requirements of men and women for the services and for munitionsover the 21 months from last April to the end of 1943 are in excess of 2 millions and may be as much as 2^ millions. The proportion of men in the services, civil defence and munitions is slightly less than in the last war; but it looks as if onlya further three-quarters of a million can be squeezed out of the &quot; less essential &quot;industries and not all of these will be available for the services, or for the servicesand munitions industries combined. The services alone, however&apos;, require from1,200,000 to 1,500,000. Thus, if the full requirements of the services and of the munitions industries are to be fulfilled, there will remain a large deficit of man-power, with no means of meeting it,7. An important factor in the determination of British man-power policyis the volume of finished munitions that can be expected to be made available for[24240] copy No.   1()5
our forces from American production. There should be an effort to arrive at an understanding with the United States Government on combined production plans and long-range assignments.8. In summary, the following lines of action are proposed : (i) The maximum comb-out of non-munition occupations, includingnational and local government and other services, combined with thetraining of the older men for munitions,(ii) The most drastic steps to get the best results from labour in the munition industries, including better utilisation of existing manufac-turing facilities.(iii) The urgent reconsideration by each Service Department of its scales of equipment, establishment and reserves, in the knowledge that thealternative to economy will be a reduction in service man-power.(iv) The placing of as many orders as is practicable in overseas countries,especially in Canada.(v) An attempt to secure agreement with the United States on a combined production programme and on the long-range assignment of finished munitions.There should be a prompt study of the man-power survey with a view to makinga comprehensive allocation of the man-power of the country, taking into account the decisions reached in the combined planning of production and making full allowance for all the economies obtained &quot;from (i) to (v) above. This allocationshould determine the ceiling of man-power for the munition industries and should lead to a decision on the final scale of the Services.Great George Street, S.W. 1.September 15. 1942.THE 1943 PRODUCTION PROGRAMME.1942.1. One of the first tasks undertaken by the J.W.P.S. was to examine whetherthe war production programmes of the present year, 1942, were capable of execution from the point of view of man-power and materials. So far as man-power was concerned, the view was expressed that, when allowance was. made forthe inevitable overstatement of requirements, the needs of 1942 could be justabout; met. There would, however, be no margin of safety; some categories of requirements, such as those for mobile women for the services and possibly forcertain regions of the country, could not be met; and even these relativelyfavourable conclusions depended upon a greatly increased intake of marriedwomen, on a full-time or part-time basis. The raw materials required could besupplied, but only at the cost of running down stocks.Present Position.2. In the three months that have passed since that paper was written theposition has not changed for the better.The rate of sinkings has continued high, and it is clear that total losses forthe year are going to be greater than was assumed. This does not directly affectthe supplies of raw materials available for consumption in 1942. But bychanging the shipping outlook for 1943 and postponing the date at which thefirst net increase of importing tonnage can be&apos; expected, it does severely call inquestion the policy of rapidly drawing on stocks.3. On the man-power side, actual needs have up to the present been substantially met. The rate of intake of women into the munitions industries isbeing maintained, and the number of part-time women in industry shows a con-siderable rise. Subject to the qualifications stated in paragraph 1, there is no )reason to think that the needs of the original programmes for 1942 cannot be met.There is, however, no margin, and to the extent that those programmes have beenor may be increased the hope of meeting requirements must be diminished.4. In this connection it has become increasingly clear in the last two monthsthat the obligations accepted in connection with &quot;Bolero&quot; impose a heavierstrain on the productive resources, including man-power, of the country than was originally appreciated. This would be so even if the &quot; Bolero &quot; commitmentwere restricted to the absolute minimum provision of facilities for the reception of American troops. Actually, of course, we are going far beyond that andundertaking to provide for the Americans a great variety of finished stores.
194$ Requirements.5. When the review is carried forward into 1943 we find that an increase is called for under almost all heads.6. The challenge to our command of the sea in the East and in the Mediter-ranean and the extension of the U-boat campaign against the shipping of theUnited Nations require that still greater efforts be made to strengthen ourposition at sea. Something may be done to speed up production by various devicesin the shipyards. But the need is so great that the Admiralty programme must inevitably call for more labour as well as materials.7. The Aircraft programme is also a long way from its peak. RecentAmerican decisions have had the effect of reducing the number of American-built aircraft that the R.A.F. can expect to receive. Even though these decisions will not reduce the overall total of aircraft at the disposal of theUnited Nations, it is clear that British formations will be needed to the utmostof our capacity. As production grows and firms come into full production, output per head should improve very considerably. But the planned increase is such that in the most favourable circumstances we must expect the numbers in theaircraft industry to rise continuously certainly through the greater part of 1943.although at a diminishing rate. The new American policy means that the size of the R.A.F. at the peak will be less than was previously planned. But there willbe a substantial intense above the present level, and any savings due to reduc-tions in the planned maximum number of formations may be offset by thenecessity for increasing ground staffs to ensure the maximum utilisation of aircraft and airfields.8. On present planning a reduction in the numbers working for theMinistry of Supply is not yet in sight for the following reasons : (i) Even in those eases where there is no question of introducing an improved pattern, capital equipment will not be complete until sometime in 1943 and only then will it be possible to reduce production to a maintenance basis,(ii) In many cases existing weapons and types of equipment must bereplaced by more effective ones, which will postpone still further thedate at which capital equipment will be completed.(iii) The reserve of equipment provided in the 1942 statement of require-ments will be absorbed by the Dominion and Allied divisions whichare to be equipped by March 1943, and the requirements formulatedduring July provide for the building up during 1943 of an additionalpool. The requirements to the end of 1943 are up from 30 per cent,to 70 per cent, above the requirements as previously stated. If these requirements are to be met, either considerably more labour will be needed by the Ministry of Supply, or very large quantit ics must be assigned from American and Empire production.(iv) There are also additional requirements to supply American needs.9. Finally, since Great Britain is to be the base for the offensive of theUnited Nations, its working efficiency must be maintained, the wear and tear of plant made good and the transportation system kept up to the mark, while theservicing of American troops will make a substantial call upon our man-powerand on our supplies of materials.Industrial Capacity.10. The prospect of coping with these demands will be considered under thethree heads of industrial capacity, raw materials and man-power. Plant capacity and machine tools will not, in general, be the limiting factors, though there will doubtless be specific difficulties and there will be a large continuing liability for maintenance and replacement. It is not often realised what a sharp change fromthe conditions hitherto prevailing is embodied in this statement. Until thepresent, the unspoken major hypothesis of British production has been that theexistence of capacity governed the rate of output. Production departments were expected to go ahead and increase capacity as rapidly as they could, with theunderstanding that the labour and the materials needed to run the capacity wouldbe found. The position will henceforth be very different and will require a changein the instincts of production departments which will be very difficult to secure.[242401 b 2
Raw Materials.11. The available quantity of raw materials depends in large measure onthe shipping position. The decisions taken by the War Cabinet on the 28th july and. the subsequent conclusions of the Combined Shipping Adjustment Boardsshed a certain amount of light on the prospects. The minimum import programmes into the United Kingdom have been assessed at 25 million tons in1942 and 27 million tons in 1943, and American assistance is to be requested tobring imports up to these figmes, though it is by no means certain that it willbe granted. If it is granted in full, there will be 52 million tons of importsavailable in the two years, which will be increased by the 4 million tons which,it has been decided, it will be legitimate to draw from stocks. This makes atotal availability of 56 million tons. From this must be deducted, first, theso-called &quot;Board of Trade&quot; programme, of which finished munitions arepotentially the most important constituent. The size of this programme is veryhard to predict, but it can hardly be put at less than 3 million tons over the twoyears, and it may well be more. There must also be deducted the minimumconsumption of imported food. At the 1942 rate, with allowance for economies(or rather, for a higher consumption of home-produced food), this might amountto 22 or 23 million tons.12. This would leave a figure for consumption of raw materials of 30 to31 million tons. The latest estimate of consumption of imported materials in1942 is 14-1 million tons, and, in spite of economies, the requirement for 1943 islikely to be rather larger, say, 29 million tons for the two years.13. The position would appear to be that, on the most favourableassumptions, there will be enough shipping to provide the raw materials thatwill be needed in 1943. But this is the upper limit of the probabilities, andif anything goes wrong with the shipping calculations if sinkings are higherthan expected, if imports of finished munitions are larger than the estimates, or if United States assistance in shipping to the full extent requested does not materialise there will be a deficit. Moreover, there is the further questionwhether, the raw materials will be available to fill the ships. In some cases, ofwhich rubber is the outstanding example, it is already clear that the world-wide shortage is severe enough to affect munitions programmes. The lightmetals are also in short supply. In a number of other cases, such as steel andcopper, the rapid development of American programmes may lead to a positionin which the British allocations are endangered. It is impossible to be precisewhere there are so many unknowns. But on balance it seems unlikely that allraw materials will be available in the necessary volume.Man-Power.14. Man-power will present an even more serious problem. The severity ofthe man-power shortage can be appreciated from the progress already made in itsredistribution and from a comparison with the degree of mobilisation achieved in the last war. (N.B. Both these figures and the later figures relating to demand are approximate and in some degree speculative; more precise figures will be available in a few weeks&apos; time in the Man-Power Survey which is being prepared by the Ministry of Labour and National Service) : Distribution of Adult Population.(Men, 14-64; Women. 14-59.

15. From these figures it is apparent that what can broadly be calledmobilisation &quot; had, last April, already proceeded as far as at the height of thelast war. The proportion of men and women in the services and in the munitions industries together was already slightly higher than in 1918. The distribution,however, was different. In the last war, for every 100 persons in the fightingservices there were 64i persons in the munitions industries. Now, for every100 persons in the fighting services there are 125 persons in the. munitions industries, and, in addition, 10^ full-time persons in Civil Defence. . Theproportion of the total population in the other essential industries is somewhatlarger than in the last war, owing to the greater numbers in National and LocalGovernment.16. Hence, if further man-power is to be drawn into the services or munitions industries, it will involve an effort even greater than we made at the height ofthe last war. It is certain that larger numbers will be needed. The requirementsof the Services for the nine months April to December 1942 were stated to be468,500 men and 227,000 women, a total of 695,500. The requirements for the munitions industries for the ten months March to December were stated to be221,000 men and 443,000 women, a total of 664,000. It may prove impossible tomeet the Service requirement for women, while the munitions requirements both for men and for women appear, from the experience of recent months, to havehad an element of over-statement. But even with these adjustments, the totalrequirement by the end of 1942 can hardly be put at less than 1 million over and above the figures in the table.17. The requirements for 1943 are much less precise. So far as the services are concerned, the Minister of Labour has stated that severe fighting on theContinent might well lead to a requirement of 1 million men to maintain theforces though this should be regarded as a maximum figure, the minimum beingperhaps 700,000. Requirements for the Production Departments are unknovvn,but on present indications it seems likely that the Departments will ask for a nettotal of some hundreds of thousands. On top of all this, there is the labourcost of the obligations accepted in connection with the Bolero movement.The greater part of this is likely to be indirect rather than direct that isto say, it will be required for the great variety of activities necessary to&apos;&apos; service &apos;&apos; an addition of over one million to the population of this island ratherthan for specific projects intended for American use. In sum, it would appearthat the additional requirement of men and women necessary over the 21 months from April 1942 to December 1943 to carry out the present plans of the servicesand of the production departments and to meet Bolero obligations is in excessof 2 millions and may be as much as 2* millions.18. This figure which is, of course, very approximate gives a measure ofthe-difficulty of the task. The population of working age will not increase; thenumbers required can be found only by redistribution of the existing numbers;and the table above shows how difficult this will be. The residium of technically&quot;unoccupied&quot; persons (including, of course, most of the housewives of thenation) is, in proportion to the total population, already substantially smaller thanin the last war. The &quot; less essential &quot; industries are already down to the samefraction of the total population.19. On the other hand, the figures seem to show that, whereas the transfer ofwomen to munitions and the services is on a greater scale than in 1918, the disturbance has been less in the case of men :  Distribution of Adult Male Population.(Men 14-64.

Thus, there are proportionately more men in the munitions industriesthan in 1918, but for the whole group of fighting services and munitions industries, the proportion is less than in 1918. In order to reach the proportionof the last war, the Services and Munitions would have to absorb some 700,000more men. The &quot;Other Industries and Professions&quot; and &quot;All Others&quot;categories contain some 570,000 more men. than they would if they were reducedto the same proportion of the total as in 1918. If we take the building industry,a miscellaneous group and the &quot; All Others &quot; category, the figure is over 1 million.If we could assume that conditions to-day were the same as those of 1918, we couldconclude that these men should be available for the services or munitions.21. But the possibilities of transfer are limited by two considerations one is the higher age distribution of the population than in 1918, which means that a smaller proportion are of suitable age for the Services. The other is that, aswomen have already been drawn in larger proportion than before both into,munitions and into the Services, there are fewer women available to take the placeof men in other occupations.22. In the &quot; essential &quot; class, the number of men in National and LocalGovernment Service has risen from 1-08 millions in 1939 to 1-25 millions in1942 compared with 390,000 in 1918. There are many men on the public payroll whose work is certainly not of the highest priority and who could be released if a comb-out were made on a more stringent basis than has hitherto been applied.  A few could also be obtained from Public Utilities and Transport.23. But the most important single source of recruitment for the Servicesand Munitions that still remains is the Building trade in the &quot; Other industries and Professions &quot; category. This industry should be able to dispense with over one-third of the 940,000 men employed in April of this year, when they have completed the task of providing housing, stores, &amp;c, for the American Army, and finished the factories that have still to be built for the Aircraft programme.24. The numbers of men in the other industries in this group have alreadybeen greatly reduced. Tor example, the distributive trades fell from 2 million men in 1939 to 1-13 millions in 1942; textiles, clothing, wood and paper from1-21 millions to 0-62 millions;, and &quot;other industries and professions&quot; from1-62 millions to 0-91 millions. But the war requires that any work that can be dispensed with must be sacrificed if we are to develop our full offensivestrength. There are still many men who are working at less than their full capacity or on jobs that could be abandoned without serious privation to the civilpopulation. There can certainly be a further comb-out if the need is greatenough. It is true that many of the male workers remaining in the &quot; all other &quot;group are over military age; but we must face the task of training them to domunition work.25. From all such sources three-quarters of a million men might be foundin the 21 months ending December 1943, though it does not follow that all of these will be available for the Services, or even for the Services and the munition industries combined. -26. The Services alone, however, will require from 1,200,000 to 1,500,000 menin the same period. When other industries have been combed out, the only poolfrom which still further numbers can be found for the Services will be -the younger men in the munitions industries.   The facts of the situation, as recited. Mid. 1939.Millions. Per cent.-53 3-3-53 3-3-89 5-53-72 23-210-90 68-016-04 1001942 (April).Millions.

above, show how difficult it will be fully to replace these younger men with oldermen. But, if they are not fully replaced and the total number of men in the munition industries falls, the result must be a reduction in output unless either&apos;very large additional numbers of women are found for these industries or else itis possible to combine an increased dilution by female labour with a rise in output per head.27. The employment of women can go further, but not very much further.The proportion of the total number of women who are in munition work is alreadyhigher than 25 years ago and dilution by female labour in these industries hasalready proceeded further. The number of married women not gainfully occupiedis also very probably less than 25 years ago. No other reserve of women is available except those still employed in the &quot; less essential &quot; industries, and toreduce these much further would almost inevitably involve a reduction in thestandard of living of the civil population generally.28. Ways of bringing pressure .to increase output per head are dealt withbelow. The extent of such improvement cannot be forecast. But even though sub-stantial results may be achieved, the numbers required are so large that it will almost certainly not be possible to meet the full requirements of the Services,including the wastage of a continental war, and at the same time achieve theproduction programmes&apos; that are now planned for all the Services.Possible Policies.29. What, then, should be donei It would be possible to leave plans as they stand and allow everything to fall behind in a haphazard way. It would be wiser to adjust our plans to available resources.The possibilities are :- (a) To reduce less essential work still further, to place still greater restric-tions on civilian supplies and drastically to comb-out national andlocal government and other services.(b) To employ labour more efficiently in the munition industries and to distribute it to greater advantage.(c) To scrutinise and reduce reserves and scales of equipment.(d) To secure a larger proportion of the equipment for the British services from overseas.(e) To limit the man-power allotted to the fighting services as a whole.30. (a) Most of the &apos;&apos; less essential &apos;&apos; industries and services will by the endof 1942 have been reduced to a point at which any further curtailment wouldinvolve a reduction in the existing standard of consumption and convenience ofthe public. Substantial additional numbers of persons from the &quot; less essential &quot;industries and services can therefore only be obtained if the decision is taken to lower this standard. The limiting factor is that the morale and stamina of thecivil population must be maintained at a level sufficient to stand the strain of awar which may last a long time yet. It is suggested that the limit has not yetbeen reached, and that there is still room for some further civil restriction, andtherefore for a reduction in the man-power requirements of the &quot; less essential &quot;industries and services. It has also been suggested above that there is room fora substantial reduction in the numbers in national and local government and other services. But it is&apos;unlikely that further cuts in these directions will provideanything like the numbers that may be needed,3.1. (b) There are several things to be done if we are to get the last ounce outof our munition industries. In the first place, the productivity of labour can beraised by (i) Encouragement of employers and trade unions to accept new ideas for(ii) Concentration of production into the larger and more efficient units and consequent diminution of the number of small units which arewasteful of skilled labour.(iii) Careful training of the older workers who are brought into these industries.(iv) More complete use of existing machine tools and buildings rather thanusing labour and material on the production of new ones,(v) Devices for reviving a sense of urgency and stimulating output whichhas flagged during the summer months.
32. Allied to this is the need for the utmost possible mobility in the supplyof man-power and the utmost possible elasticity in the use of it. It will not be enough to deal with individuals; provision should be made for the rapid transferof blocks of labour from one factory to another.33. A third line of action is doser budgeting. Some margins of capacitymust be retained against sudden expansions of the scale of war and otherunexpected developments. But all margins tend to be on a high scale on a rising-curve, and when peak output is reached can be reconsidered with advantage. TheDepartments should examine again their reserves of components and of industrial capacity.34. These and other economies of man-power would be stimulated if adefinite ceiling of man-power were fixed for the munition industries or for thetotal employment of the three Production Departments.35. (c) Scales of equipment and the size of reserves of munitions are under constant review by the Services. The review might be more effective if it were fully realised that the penalty of failure may be a reduction in the size of theForces. There are also economies to be reaped from standardisation of equipment. The War Office Standing Committee on Co-ordination andStandardisation of Design is doing valuable work, and similar examination inall Services might be equally effective.36. (d) Some relief could undoubtedly be obtained by a policy of main-taining and even expanding orders for British stores and equipment in british overseas countries. Canada is likely to present the best opportunities for thispolicy, since the available production in other British countries (though it shouldbe stimulated to the full) is not likely to be large. But there are obviousdisadvantages in relying on imports.A merican -Policy and the British Programme.37. Whether we should count upon the United States to provide for growing-British forces, or alternatively whether we are near the limit of the numbers wecan raise, equip and maintain in the Services these are matters which dependin the long run upon American policy, and can only finally be determined in discussions with the United States.38. If it were certain that the war would be over in 1943. we should certainlytransfer the maximum number of men that can be trained from munitions to thefighting Services and take large risks in running down not only our stocks ofraw material, but also the hidden reserves of work in progress in the factories.But clearly we cannot make this assumption.39. If, then, we must base our plans on a war of indeterminate duration, thescale on which we can raise, equip and maintain the British Navy, Army and AirForce depends on the size of the American Armed Forces and on the extent towhich the United States can budget to produce surpluses of certain main itemsover and above the needs of its own forces. If, for example, the United states were prepared to add 50 per cent, or 100 per cent, to Britain&apos;s output of finished munitions -in addition to supplying our minimum needs for raw material and components we could afford to squeeze the munition industries considerablyduring the next eighteen months and rely on the United States to provide forthe expansion of our services. But if the American Forces are likely to absorbnearly all the munitions which the United States itself produces, we should budget for the British and Empire forces on as near a self-sufficiency basis as possible and try to establish an even balance between the man-power needs of the forces and Munitions respectively.40. The right decision undoubtedly lies somewhere between these twoextremes. We can only make a complete and final disposition iOf our man-power on the basis of definite inter-Allied production plans and long-range assignments.Such plans are now taking shape for certain major stores; we should continue topress for long-range assignments over as wide a field as possible.The Man-power  Survey.41. When this major uncertainty has been removed, it should be possible toproceed to present a clearer quantitative picture of the supply of and demand forman-power in this country.  It should then be possible to estimate 
(a) the maximum number of men who might be i-eleased from non-munitionwork;(b) how these should be allotted to munitions and the services respectively;and(e) what comb-out can be made from the munitions industries to the Services.This can be clone as soon as the results of the Man-power Survey of the Ministryof Labour and National Service, which is now being made, are available.42. At the moment, the maximum man-power available for the Servicescannot be forecast. But the apparent divergence between demand and supply is so great that a limit on the expansion or even an actual reduction may be inevitable in 1943. This should be regarded as a last resort not last in the sense that all consideration of it should be deferred until the crisis arises, butlast in the sense that the maximum possible contribution from other sourcesshould first be assessed, and only if there is still a deficit after this has beendone should the possibility of curtailing the services&apos; intake be approached.Proposed A ction.43.   In summary, the following lines of action are proposed: (i) The maximum comb-out of non-munition occupations, includingnational and local government and other services, combined with thetraining of the older men for munitions.(ii) The most drastic steps to get the best results from labour in the munition industries, including better utilisation of existing manufac-turing facilities.(iii) The urgent reconsideration by each Service Department of its scales of equipment, establishment and reserves, in the knowledge that thealternative to economy will be a reduction in service man-power.(iv) The placing of as many orders as is practicable in overseas countries,especially in Canada,(v) An attempt to secure agreement with the United States on a combined production programme and on the long-range assignment of finished munitions.There should be a prompt study of the man-power survey with a view to makinga comprehensive allocation of the man-power of the country, taking into account the decisions reached in the combined planning of production and making full allowance for all the economies obtained from (i) to (v) above. This allocationshould determine the ceiling of man-power for the munition industries and should lead to a decision on the final scale of the Services.44. In general, the problem needs to be worked out in quantitative terms inthe form of an equation of supply and demand for man-power. It is evident that by the end of the present year the limit of the man-power that can be provided forthe war sector that is. for the Armed Forces, for Civil Defence and for munitions production will be in sight. There will then remain only a small lastinstalment. A clear directive is needed on the placing of this last instalmentbefore the training of its members is begun whether into munitions or theservices, whether into the Navy, the Army or the Air Force. The threeproduction departments should be made aware of the impending exhaustion oflabour supplies and of the limitations that it will place on their programmes.They should be invited to keep their production under constant scrutiny to ensurethat labour is being used in the most economical manner for purposes that aretruly necessary.
