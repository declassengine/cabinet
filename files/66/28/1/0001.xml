A general map of thearea covered by this appreciation is attached as Appendix &quot; D.&quot;Strategic Significance.Sea Communications.2. West Africa owes its strategic significance principally to its geographical position relative to the Central Atlantic &quot;waistline,&quot; through which pass theshipping routes to West and South Africa, South America, the Middle East,India and Australia, as well as those between Germany and Japan. Freetownis of particular importance as a bunkering and convoy assembly port half-waybetween the United Kingdom and the Cape.3. Our ability to control the sea communications jn the Central Atlantic is dependent on -(a) The retention for our own use of the Naval base at Freetown, togetherwith subsidiary fuelling bases at Bathurst and Pointe Noire, and theirassociated air bases; and(b) The denial of similar facilities to the enemy in this area (e.g., at Dakar).Air Communications.4. There are at present two British and one United States air routes acrossWest Africa. A mapt showing the existing routes is attached. The security ofthese routes is at present essential to the air reinforcement of Middle East andIndia.5. While we are unable to use Malta as a staging point, and so long as our forward aerodromes lie east of El Alamein, Bathurst will remain a key pointin our medium bomber route to the Middle East and India. Without it we wouiibe unable to deliver these aircraft by air from the United Kingdom, and theirconveyance by sea is impracticable.Economic Interests.6. West Africa is a valuable source of rubber, iron ore, tin, columbite,manganese and oilseeds useful both to ourselves and to the enemy.* W.M. (42) 97th Conclusions, Minute 3. f Appendix E.[24245] &apos;   - B
Communications and Climate.7. A map* showing the land communications is attached. West Africa is *almost completely isolated from the northward by the Sahara. The few tracksacross the desert which exist are quite unsuitable for large-scale movements oftroops, vehicles and stores. All such movements into West Africa must be effected by sea through the ports south of the Senegal River; but limited movement oflightly equipped personnel could be effected across the Sahara by air.8. Within West Africa itself the distances are very great Nigeria aloneis approximately equal in area to France and Germany combined, and the distance from Bathurst to the N.E. corner of Nigeria is twice that from london to Gibraltar direct.9. In the British Colonies rail communications are scarce, and there are few all-weather roads. The paucity of land communications and the fact thatthe British Colonies are separated from each other by Vichy territory make itnecessary for all considerable movements of forces between them to be effected by sea through the ports, which are few and far between.Subject to the provision of the necessary transport aircraft, which is unlikelyat present, limited numbers of lightly-equipped personnel could be transferredby air.10. Vichy territory, on the other hand, possesses in Dakar a first-classdefended port with communications by rail and road into the interior, andSenegal is well provided with aerodromes. Dakar is, in fact, the key to VichyWest Africa.11. In such a large area the weather varies considerably. Broadly speaking,north of the 8th degree of latitude (Freetown) the dry season starts in november and lasts till May. In the forest belt of Nigeria and the Gold Coast, the dryseason starts in November and ends in March. Farther south and east, thedry seasons start later, until in the Congo it lasts from the end of April to september.During the height of the rains, it becomes impossible to carry out any considerable movement off the roads, even in the semi-desert to the south of theSahara. During this season it is sometimes impossible to operate even on theroads for periods of several days at a time.12. Weather does not restrict flying to any great extent though it sometimesprevents it for short periods owing to heavy rain or dust storms, and in the Lagosarea, owing to early morning fog. In general, flying is possible on all but afew days in any one month.Existing Threat.13. While Vichy remains subservient to the Axis the fact of our west african, possessions being interspersed with Vichy territory leaves the whole area in a state of somewhat uneasy strategic equilibrium- Bathurst, for example,lies unpleasantly close to Dakar; Freetown could be menaced from Conakry, andLagos from Cotonou. The Chad district of Fighting French territory adjoinsLibya on the north and Vichy French territory on the west, though distancespreclude any operations from Vichy French territory on a large scale.Axis Threat.14. In existing circumstances the most serious threat to our West Africanpossessions lies in submarine attack on their sea communications. There is alsoa remote threat of attack by armed raiders. The extent of the submarine threatis limited by the distances from Axis bases and the existence of more attractivetargets elsewhere, but it must be expected to increase &quot;with the larger number of u-boats becoming available, and the increased efficiency *.of American anti-submarine measures in the West Atlantic. The Freetown area is likely tocontinue to receive the lion&apos;s share of attention from U-boats in West Africanwaters. *15. Attacks on the air route are unlikely, owing to its distance from the nearest enemy base, and would probably not exceed freak raids by Axis aircraft operating singly or in small numbers from Southern&apos;Libya. These attacks wouldnot be a serious menace, since, in order to cut the route, they would have to resultin putting two or more adjacent aerodromes out of action.* Appendix F.
The capture of Faya in Northern Chad would provide an advanced base for air and land operations against the air route, but its capture is improbable.Moreover, not only are the aerodromes in Northern Chad unsuitable for theoperation of modern bombers, but the problem of supplying them would be verydifficult.Vichy Threat.        \16. We have to take into account the possibility of an attempt by Vichyto recover French Equatorial Africa, or to carry out an attack of short durationagainst British&apos; interests in retaliation for action by us elsewhere. e.g.,Madagascar. We do not regard offensive action by Vichy as likely in the presentcircumstances, and action on a large scale would be out of the question withoutdirect Axis help.  We attach details* of Vichy forces.17. The only route by which Vichy land forces could attack fighting french territory lies close to the northern frontier of Nigeria and is thereforevulnerable to counter attack by our forces. Consequently, the likelihood of suchan attack in present circumstances is regarded as very remote.18. The most likely form of Vrchy attack, if any, against our interests would be (a) Attempts to interrupt our air reinforcement route by air attacks againstTakoradi, Lagos, and Accra in particular.(b) Air and submarine attacks against our ports and their approaches.Potential Threat.19. We cannot afford to exclude from our calculations the possibility ofAxis penetration into West Africa at some future date,- e:g., in the case of a russian collapse. Such penetration would almost certainly be preceded by Axisoccupation of North Africa. If, however, we forestalled the Axis occupation ofFrench North Africa, this potential threat would not arise.20. If the Axis succeeded in obtaining control of French North-WestAfrica, it would be a comparatively simple matter for them to extend their occupation to Senegal, since we could not hope, from our existing bases, to severthe sea communications between Casablanca and Dakar.21. The establishment of the Axis in Senegal would undermine our west african position and imperil the whole of our Atlantic communications and our air reinforcement route. The immediate results would be an increased scale ofnaval and air attack upon our sea communications in West African waters, a land and air threat to the Gambia, and an air threat to Sierra Leone. We attach tan estimate of the scales of land and air attack which could be developed in thepresent state of communications and aerodrome capacity. In time the Axis might increase these scales of attack, and they would be extended to other parts of ourWest African possessions unless we could effectively interrupt the enemy&apos;scommunications.22. Seaborne combined operations against British possessions could not beundertaken until local naval and air superiority had been obtained. In the firstinstance, only the Gambia is likely to be threatened.Defence Situation.Policy.23. Our policy is to avoid the war spreading to West Africa. At the sametime, we wish to retain full liberty of military action in West Africa, and wetherefore regard any idea of entering into a compact to preserve the status quoof Vichy territory as unacceptable.24. If, in spite of our efforts, the war spreads to West Africa our policy would be : (a) To maintain  the  integrity  of  all  British  and  Fighting  Frenchpossessions and if possible secure Dakar.(6) Failing this, to secure all ports and the air reinforcement route to the* Middle East.(c) In the last resort to concentrate on the security of Freetown andBathurst.* Appendix A. f Appendix B.f242451 b 2
Mfl-vdl Forces.25. Protection against attack by surface forces in existing circumstancesis provided by our general naval dispositions in the Atlantic. The acute shortage of A/S forces makes it necessary to dispose those available accordingto the incidence of the submarine threat and the relative importance of the traffic from time to time. It is not practicable, therefore^e, to lay down any definite scale of A/S protection for this area.Land Forces.26. The British Field Army in West Africa consists of seven West AfricanInfantry Brigades. One further Infantry Brigade Group will be provided bythe Belgian Congo for use in British West Africa as soon as shipping becomes available. All these brigades are equipped for fighting in close country only.They have no A.F.Vs., A.A. or A. Tk.* guns and only light artillery, and arenot therefore fit to meet an enemy possessing modern equipment in open country.The Fighting French Forces in French Equatorial Africa consist of the equivalent of 12 Battalions, but, with the exception of the five battalions inthe Chad, most of these units are ill-equipped and cannot be regarded as equalin fighting value to British West African troops. All Fighting French troops are likely to be fully employed in ensuring defence of their own territory.Air Forces.27. The British air forces now stationed in West Africa amount to1^ Hurricane Squadrons, divided between Freetown,, Kaduna and Takoradi, 2Flying Boat Squadrons and 1 Hudson Squadron. Of these, the general reconnaissance aircraft are fully employed in protection of sea communications.There are also one flight of Blenheims, one flight of mary lands, and one squadron of Lysanders with the Fighting French Air Force, and one Belgian fighter squadron.in the Congo. The latter will not be available until the end of 1942;A United States Army Air Corps Fighter Squadron, manned by negropersonnel, will be based in Liberia in the near future.28. In addition, there are always about 45 fighters and 14 bombersoperationally serviceable at Takoradi, or along the route which could be divertedfor defence purposes, provided the necessary facilities for their operation andmaintenance are available.These facilities already exist at aerodromes in the coastal areas, and keyaerodromes are being stocked with petrol, oil, ammunition and bombs. Spares,light equipment and maintenance crews would be sent by air from Takoradi.In addition, Sector Control and Operations Rooms have been established on thecoast.29.   Details of Allied land and air forces are given at Appendix &quot; C.&quot;Defence against German Penetration into French West Africa.30. If our enemies had established themselves in Senegal with a secureline of communication through French North Africa, the direct defence of ourWest African territories would be a very formidable undertaking. It would be dependant on our ability to keep open our lines of communication through the ports; a task which would become increasingly difficult in face of the scale of submarine and air attack which could be developed in West African waters.Even if this difficulty could be overcome the build-up of our forces for a successfuldefence would conflict with pressing commitments elsewhere which are alreadystraining our resources to the utmost, and larger-scale reinforcement might well prove impracticable.31. By occupying the Canaries we could severely restrict, but not entirelyprevent, the building up of Axis forces in French West Africa. This move mighthave already been forced on us owing to our having been denied the use of gibraltar by German penetration into North Africa or Spain; but seizure of theCanaries in any other circumstances would in all probability lead to our losingthe use of Gibraltar, as a result of antagonising Spain. This would be an unsatisfactory exchange.* Twelve Bofors guns per Brigade to work in an Anti-Aircraft and Anti-Tank role haverecently.been approved, but not yet supplied..
32. We conclude that the only complete counter to the threat of Germanpenetration into French West Africa would be to forestall them by seizing Dakarourselves.33. Operations against Dakar have been accepted as an American respon-sibility, and a preliminary reconnaissance has been made which indicates that very considerable base development will be required before the operation could beundertaken.  The operation is not possible except as a long-term project.Conclusions.34.   Our conclusions are: (a) The policy outlined in paragraphs 23 and 24 is sound.(b) For the present our defences should be maintained at sufficient strength to provide a reasonable degree of security for West Africa againstexisting Axis and vichy threats. We cannot afford to divert muchof our strength to an area which is not now, and may never become,a theatre of war.(Signed) DUDLEY POUND.C. PORTAL.A. E.

Operations against British West Africa would be limited by aerodromecapacity, internal and. external ions and the lack of equipment,supplies, aviation spirit and M.T. petrol.3. It is unlikely that the communications and aerodrome capacity could be expanded for 6 months after the defeat of Russia. The scale of attack couldnot therefore be greatly increased until after this period.4.

Isolated raids on Takoradi and Accra by small numbers of aircraft usingaerodromes in the Ivory Coast as advanced landing grounds are possible butunlikely. Similar raids on Lagos from aerodromes in Togoland and Dahomey arealso possible but unlikely. In both cases difficulty of supply would be the limiting factor.A combination of the German and French air forces would not greatly increase the scale of effort above that of the German air force alone, owing to thesupply problem and lack of aerodrome accommodation.APPENDIX C.British and Allied Forces.1.

On the face of it, the Allies have a considerable numerical&apos;superiority in Combatant Troops in West Africa over those of Vichy.(Appendix A.)The Allied Field Force element, however, totals only 52,000.Furthermore, as the British Colonies are separated from each other byVichy territory, all considerable movement of forces between them hasto be effected by sea, which is necessarily slow. Vichy, on the otherhand, can more rapidly concentrate in superior strength against any oneof our possessions through being on interior lines and unrestricted bythe necessity of movement by sea.Any direct comparison between the totals of Vichy and Allied forces would therefore be misleading.]
