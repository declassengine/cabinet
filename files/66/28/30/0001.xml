THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1942.SECRET. Copy. No.W.P. (42) 400.September 7, 1942.WAR CABINET.PROPOSED UNITED STATES MISSION TO THE MIDDLE EAST.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues herewith a copy of an aide-memoire con-taining a proposal for a special United States mission to the Middle East, whichwas left with me recently by the United States Ambassador, together with a record of my conversation with Mr. Winant on this subject on the 4th September.A. E.Foreign Office, September 7, 1942.ANNEX 1.Aide-Memoire.THE Embassy has received from the Secretary of State a telegramconcerning a plan regarding the situation in the Near East which has beendiscussed with the President and has received his general approval. Thesubstance of that telegram is as follows : 1. The United States Joint Chiefs of Staff for some time have been givingspecial consideration to the situation in the Near East and have discussed withthe Department of State the serious consequences for the United Nations of possible Axis success in this ai^ea. They feel that every possible effort, both political and military, must be made to hold this vital region.2. The United States still holds a fortunate position in the Near East andits prestige and influence are high. The people of that area seem, to realise thatthe United States has no territorial or political interest there, and, due largely to a century of American missionary, educational and philanthropic efforts,there is widespread goodwill toward the United Nations.3. Although large American military forces are not at the present time available for the protection of the Near East, in view of the aforesaid goodwillit is the feeling of the Department of State that in the field of political action and propaganda the United States is in a position to make an important contribution to help the United Nations hold that area..4. In an effort to be of help in the political field in the face of the existing situation, the Department of State has under contemplation the following two&apos;specific steps : (a) the issuance of a declaration of United States Government policy inregard to the Near East along the lines of the attached draft;(b) the appointment of a diplomatic agent to Syria and the Lebanon.5. A further step is under consideration by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Theyfully realise that the Near East is primarily a British theater of militaryresponsibility, but they feel that an American mission, part military and parteconomic, might in the light of the American position in the Near East contribute to the United Nations&apos; success in that area, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have,11842   [24316]
therefore, in mind the sending of such an American mission to the Near East assoon as possible.6. An initial activity of such a mission would be to make an economic survey of the area. In addition, two sections of the mission would upon arrival in the Near East start setting up S.I. and S.O. organisations, respectively, whichcan continue to supply information and harass the enemy should the area beinvaded by the Axis. In line with arrangements which it is understood havealready been agreed upon in London in regard to S.O. operations, the S.O. sectionof this mission would work in closest collaboration with the British S.O.E. ofthe Middle East Command. While it would build its own local organizations, asregards actual operations while this area remains a British theater of militaryresponsibility this section would, of course, function only with the approval and under the direction of the aforesaid British authorities.7. A major function of another section of such an American mission wouldbe to endeavor to make the most of existing goodwill toward the United states in order to gain more active support of the peoples of this area for a united nations victory. The main efforts of this section of the mission, which wouldbe quite separate from the S.I. and S.O. sections, would be in the field of political warfare and of propaganda. This would require the closest collaboration, onthe one hand, with the American consular and diplomatic representatives in this area and, on the other hand, with the local representatives of the Office of WarInformation who would actually do the propaganda work. Personal contact withinfluential leaders in the various areas of the Near East would necessarily be animportant function of the head of -this mission.8. It is intended that American propaganda throughout the Near East willbe greatly and rapidly increased, both in volume and effectiveness, over what hasbeen done to date. The need to make available in the shortest possible time anincreased amount of American news for Arabic newspapers and efficient photo- .newspaper service, pamphlets, gadgets, &amp;c, as are being offered in other partsof the world, has been discussed with the Office of War Information.9. For effective co-ordination, the activities of the mission must, of course,be subject to the general control of the American Theater Commander, and full co-operation with all other American Government agencies operative in theNear East is being arranged prior to the departure of the proposed mission.10. In its work in the Near East the American mission must operate inclosest collaboration with the British and the Fighting French, though as anindependent American organisation.   Its principal arguments will be :(a) the military power and potentialities of the United Nations;(b) the inevitable fate of the peoples of the Near East in case of Axisvictory political and. economic  enslavement  as  in  all  occupied countries;(c) the self-interest of the Near East peoples and their better prospects for political and economic development as a result of a united nations victory;id) the assurance of the support of the United States for their aspirationsto independence after the war if, in line with American and british foreign policy and the Atlantic Charter, these peoples actively assist in winning it.11. Such an American mission will naturally cover the same theater asthe Middle East Command, but its prime efforts will be aimed at the Arabic-speaking world of the Near East Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Trans-Jordan, Arabia, Iraq; because of physical location, Turkey and Iran. Theofficial headquarters will be situated in the same place as the British middle east Command, while operating headquarters probably will be established inBeirut, Lebanon, with subsidiary headquarters in each of the foregoing politicalareas. ,       .12. The proposed head of the mission is Lt.-Colonel Harold B. Hoskins,United States Army, for the past year and a half in the State department and from now on on indefinite leave of absence. Colonel Hoskins, who was born in Beirut of American missionary parents, speaks Arabic, French, German and spanish. During the last war he was a captain in the Fifth Regiment ofMarines, Second United States Division, wounded and decorated. Since then he has been in the cotton goods business in the United States, but has continued
to travel widely in Southern Europe and the Near East. He is also vice-presidentof the Board of Trustees of the American University at Beirut.13. In order to avoid competition with existing British organisations and reduce duplication to a minimum, the American mission will aim wherever possible at enlisting the support of students and graduates of American schools and colleges in the Near East as the background of its efforts. Students of these institutions are among the mental and physical elite of the countries of that area, and many of the older graduates are political and business leaders of their countries.14. The Department of State feels that the effort involved in the sending of the mission is well worth while and that its results can be substantial, especially as it will enjoy the full support of both the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Depart-ment of State, and it is hoped, therefore, that it can proceed with the prioragreement as to its American character and activities of the British political andmilitary authorities.The Embassy has been requested, therefore, to discuss the project with HisMajesty&apos;s Government with a view to its concurrence in *(1) The issuance of the attached proposed declaration of United StatesGovernment policy for the Near East. (The statement could be issuedby American diplomatic representatives in the Near East if HisMajesty&apos;s Government so desires, though it is felt that, for maximumeffect, it should be issued in Washington by. the President or theSecretary of State.)(2) The operation of the American mission along the lines outlined above.In view of the urgency which the Secretary of State attaches to this matter,an early expression of His Majesty&apos;s Governments views would be greatlyappreciated. The question is likewise being discussed with the Fighting french in view of their interest in certain regions of the Near East.London, A2igust 31, 1942.Proposed statement of the  United States Government tcith respect to theNear East.Questions have been asked as to the attitude of the Government of theUnited States towards the peoples of the Near East, with particular referenceto their future. It is therefore desirable to make known this governments attitude, which is as follows :  The war objectives of this Government as stated in the Atlantic Charterinclude the &apos;&apos; desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with thefreely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned,&quot; and respect for &quot; the right ofall peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live.&apos;&apos;An elaboration is given in the basic statement of policy made by Secretaryof State, Cordell Hull, on the 23rd July, 1942, as follows ;-&apos;&apos; We have always believed and we believe to-day that all - peoples,without distinction of race, color, or religion, who are prepared and willingto accept the responsibilities of liberty, are entitled to its enjoyment.&apos;&apos; We have always sought and we seek to-day to encourage and aidall who aspire to freedom to establish their right to it by preparing them-selves to assume its obligations. .&apos;&quot; It has been our purpose in the past and will remain our purpose in thefuture -to use the full measure of our influence to support attainment of freedom by all peoples who, by their acts, show themselves worthy.&apos;&apos;&apos;This Government is, of course, dedicated to the fulfilment of these objectives in the Near East as in other parts of the world.The record shows that the Axis powers have repeatedly and, cynicallydishonoured their promises and engagements. Therefore it is inconceivable thatany Near Eastern peoples place either faith or credence in them.&apos; The Axisaggressors threaten the maintenance and extension of freedom in the Near East;consequently, increased, participation in the war effort by all Near Easternpeoples would be in their own interest and naturally would be welcomed by theUnited States Government.
ANNEX 2.Record of Conversation with the United States Ambassador, September 4, 1942.THE United States Ambassador came to see me this morning, when I saidthat he would remember that he had left with me a few days ago an aide-memoirefrom his Government about the possibility of a special United States mission tothe Middle East. We had been into this, and there were a number of points whichI wished to make to the Ambassador on the subject. But, in the meanwhile, afurther telegram had come in from our Joint Staff Mission at Washington tothe Chiefs of Staff in London with a plan for Syria prepared by the United StatesJoint Psychological Warfare Committee. This had now been submitted by theUnited States Chiefs of Staff for the concurrence of the Combined. Chiefs of Staff.This seemed to be a different paper from that which the Ambassador had submitted to me, though in line in certain respects with it. It seemed to dealmainly with the S.O.E. angle. I must frankly say that it was one with whichwe should find it more difficult to agree than with his aide-memoire.2. The Ambassador showed considerable annoyance at this duplication of requests through different channels. He said that he had now learned that thepaper which he had handed in to me had been preceded by another on similar linesthrough another channel. He had complained of this strongly to his Governmentand would take up this new development with them.3. After some further discussion we agreed that we would postpone anyfurther examination of these papers until Monday, when we should each havehad more time to examine the various documents.
