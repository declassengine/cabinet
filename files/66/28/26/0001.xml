(42) 396.September 5, 1942.WAR CABINET.THE AXIS OIL POSITION IN EUROPE-MAY 1942.Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I circulate for the information of thelWar Cabinet the annexed report bythe Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee.        /(Intld.) C. R. A.Dominions Office, S. W. 1,September 5, 1942.ANNEX.THE AXIS OIL POSITION IN EUROPE-MAY 1942.Report by the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee.The Technical Sub-Committee on Axis Oil have made a detailed estimate* of enemy production, consumption and stocks of oil in Europe up to the 1st May,1942, together with a forecast of the enemy oil position up to the end of October.2. The rate of oil production in Axis Europe is increasing and will continueto increase. It is estimated to have been 13f million tons in 1941, and is expectedto be 15 million tons in 1942.3.   1942 supplies are drawn from the following principal sources : Per cent.Roumania ...      ...      ...      :..      ...      ...      35Synthetic production     ...      ...      ...      ...      35Other European crude   ...      ...      ...      ...      18Substitute fuels   ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      104. The flexibility of the manufacturing industry at the disposal of the Axisenables them to divide their total production into whatever range of productsmay suit them at any particular time. There is no likelihood that they will suffer from shortage of any one product in advance of a general oil shortage.5. If intense activity on the Russian front continues during.the summer and autumn of 1942, but only on one-half of the front at a time, supplies will fall short by 150-200,000 tons per month of the amount required for military needs plus civil consumption in German Europe, calculated at the rate rulingduring the summer and autumn of 1941.[24308]* J.I.C.

6. To meet military demands in full, therefore, a substantial cut in civilian consumption will be necessary. A reduction of this order would bring civil con-sumption in Axis Europe down to about 25 per cent, below the amount considered necessary for a full industrial war effort. The greatest burden of this reduction would probably have to be borne in Germany, as consumption in the remainder ofAxis Europe has already been reduced to a bare minimum, except in Roumania,where consumption is surprisingly close to its pre-war level.7. The defeat of Russia would reduce military consumption by 200,000 tonsa month. As against this, some allowance should be made for essentialnon-military consumption in occupied Russia.8. If the Germans succeed in capturing the whole of the Caucasus oil-fieldsand exploiting them to a rate of about 6 million tons per annum after the firsttwelve months of occupation, the position in German Europe, excluding Russia,can be substantially improved. The margin available for the exploitation of occupied Russia, however, will be far less than pre-war essential consumption inthat area, which amounted to about 10 million tons. .9. The Technical Sub-Committee on Axis Oil point out that substantialdamage during the course of the Russian campaign to the oil refineries at or nearPloesti in Roumania, which at present treat about 30 per cent, of GermanEuropean supplies, would have a serious effect upon the German war effort.The synthetic plant at Poelitz, which is at present converting about 1 million tons of surplus tars and fuel oil a year into gasoline and gas oil urgently requiredby the armed forces, is an important and more easily accessible alternative target.This matter is under consideration by the authorities responsible for decidingon the priorities of bombing targets.(Signed) V.
