ANNEX I.Meeting at the Kremlin on Wednesday, August 12, 1942, at 7 p.m.Present:Prime Minister.Mr. Harriman.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador.Mr. Dunlop.M. Stalin.M. Molotov.Marshal Voroshilov.M. Pavlov.THE PRIME MINISTER began by making some remarks about thesituation in Egypt, and then asked Stalin about the military situation in thiscountry.M. STALIN said that the news was not good and that the Germans were making a tremendous effort to get to Baku and Stalingrad. He did not know how they had been able to gather together so many troops and tanks and so manyHungarian, Italian and Roumanian divisions. He was sure that they haddrained the whole of Europe of troops. In Moscow the position was sound, buthe could not guarantee in advance that the Russians would be able to withstanda German attack. In the south they had been unable to stop the german offensive. They were now making a diversion at Rzhev and Viazma which wasnot doing badly; its purpose was to force the enemy to regroup his forces.THE PRIME MINISTER asked if the Germans had the means of taking afresh offensive at Voronezh or in the North. For himself, he did not think so,for they were not strong enough in the air.M. STALIN (who was looking very grave) said that, in view of the lengthof the front, it was quite possible for Hitler to detach twenty divisions and create a strong attacking force twenty divisions and two to three Panzer divisions would be quite enough. Considering what Hitler had, it would not be difficult for him to detail such a force.2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he supposed that what M. Stalinwanted him to cOme to was the question of the second front.M. STALIN said that this was as the Prime Minister wished.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he wished to speak frankly and wouldlike to invite complete frankness from Stalin. He would not have come to moscow unless he had felt sure that he would be able to discuss realities. WhenM. Molotov had come to London he had told him that we were trying to make-plans for a diversion in France. He had also made it clear to M. Molotov thathe could make no promises about 1942, and he had given M. Molotov a memo-randum to this effect. Since then an exhaustive Anglo-American examinationof the problem had been carried out. The British and American Governmentsdid not feel themselves able to undertake a major operation in September, whichwas the only month in which the weather was to be counted upon. That.was tosay, an operation which would have the effect of bringing German infantry andtank divisions back from the Russian front. But, as M. Stalin knew, the Britishand American Governments were preparing for a very great operation in 1943.For this purpose a million American troops were now scheduled to reach theUnited Kingdom at their point of assembly in the Spring of 1943, making an expeditionary force of 27 divisions, to which the British Government wereprepared to add 21 divisions. Nearly half of this force would be armoured. Sofar, only two and a half American divisions had reached the United Kingdom,but the big transportation would take place in October, November and December.3. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he. was well aware that this planoffered no help to Russia in 1942. He thought it possible that, when the 1943plan was ready, it might well be that the Germans would have a stronger armyin the west than they now had. (Stalin&apos;s face crumpled up into a frown.) Hehad good reasons against an attack on the French coast in 1942. We had onlyenough landing craft for an assault landing on a fortified coast enough to throwashore six divisions and maintain them. If it were successful, more divisionsmight be sent, but the limiting factor was landing craft, which were now being-built in very large numbers in the United Kingdom and especially in the United
States. He could say that for one division which could be carried this year itwould be possible next year to carry eight or ten times as many. He had studied in detail two particular operations : Something could be done in September witha small force at the Pas de Calais or on the stretch between Dunkirk and Dieppe.Such an operation would have for its object the drawing of the enemy air arminto an intense struggle. But we had not transport enough for forces capable ofmaking any penetration which would be deep enough to be of help. ) The Pas deCalais had this great advantage, that we could dominate it from the air, and pro-bably a very heavy battle would follow with the enemy. On the other hand, theenemy knew all about it and there was no doubt that, in this sector, he could nowbring a larger land force against us than we could transport this year. There-fore, having regard to this and the tremendous tides in the Straits of Doverwhich had a rise and fall as much as 30 feet, all landing operations were of thegreatest difficulty: One advantage would be to bring about an air battle, but it seemed almost certain that this advantage would be bought by the total defeatand destruction of the expeditionary force. Thus the enemy would have atriumph and we would have a disaster, which would be of no good to anyone.Furthermore, in order to make this attack on the Pas de Calais this year, weshould have to interrupt the training of a large mass of troops for the greatoperation of 1943, to take away key men, and to use up large numbers of landing craft and other apparatus which we were preparing for 1943. On these andother grounds, therefore, we did not think it would be wise to make any attempt on the Pas de Calais.M. STALIN (who had begun to look very glum) seemed unconvinced and asked if it were possible to attack any other part of the French coast.THE PRIME MINISTER then showed him a map which indicated thedifficulties of making an air umbrella over the North French coast. Over the pas de Calais it was possible to make a 60 per cent, effort and over Cherbourg20 per cent., and so on, down to 5 per cent, over the tip of Britanny.M. STALIN did not seem to understand and asked some questions about the range of fighter planes.  Could not they, for instance, come and go all the time ?THE PRIME MINISTER explained that they could indeed come and go,but in these circumstances they could not fight, and he added that an air umbrellato be effective had to be kept up.M. STALIN then suggested that the Channel Islands should be captured.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that he too had thought of that and heand the Americans had been considering the question of deep-water harbourswhich had obvious advantages. These lay in the region where we could give theminimum of air cover, whereas, while we could put up an air umbrella over the pas de Calais, it only had shallow harbours.M. STALIN then suggested a demonstration on the Pas de Calais and a landing at Cherbourg.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that this had been considered, but he regarded it as a waste of seed-corn. We would be on the defensive. It would bea running sore for us and not for the enemy. It would do more harm to us than to him, because it would eat into all the forces destined for the big attack nextyear.- M. STALIN said that- there was not a single German division in France ofany value.THE PRIME MINISTER contested this and said that he knew that therewere in, France 25 German divisions, nine of which were of the first line.M. STALIN replied that his information was otherwise and that, in anycase, the German divisions in France were of only two regiments apiece.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had exact information about thenumber and character of these divisions.M. STALIN expressed doubts and repeated his statement that the german divisions had been reduced to two regiments apiece and that their artillery couldbe dealt with from the air.  After all, this was a war.THE PRIME MINISTER said that war was war but not folly, and itWould be folly to invite a disaster which would help nobody.   He had brought the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and General Sir Archibald Wavell with[24254] . B 2
him in order that such points might be explained in detail to the Russian GeneralStaff. There was such a point beyond which statesmen could not carry discussions of this kind.M. STALIN (whose glumness had by now much increased) said that, as he understood it, we were unable to create a second front with any large force andunable even to land six divisions.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this was so. We could land six divisions, but the landing of them would be more harmful than helpful and hewas prepared to explain this in detail.M. STALIN asked if he was to take it that the Prime Minister consideredany attempt of this kind unwise.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that this was so, for it would greatlyinjure the big operation planned for next year. He went on to say that he fearedthe news he brought was not good news, but he could assure M. Stalin that, if bythrowing in 150,000 to 200,000 men we could render him aid by drawing away from the Russian front appreciable German forces, we would not shrink fromthis course on the grounds of loss. But if it drew no men away and spoiled theprospects for 1943, it would be a great error.M. STALIN (who had become restless) said that his view about war wasdifferent.  A man who was not prepared to take risks could not win a war.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed.M. STALIN said that the memorandum given to Molotov spoke of landingsix to ten divisions this year. Had he known that this would prove impossiblehe would have been able to offer two or three corps of his own troops.THE PRIME MINISTER reiterated his remarks about the lack of landing craft.M. STALIN said that shipping was not the point. He could have sent these troops by air. He suggested that we should not be so afraid of the Germans.We tended to over-estimate their strength. Why were we so afraid of theGermans ? He could not understand. He had some little time ago landed fromthe air a brigade of 2,500 men in the Dorogobuzh area. They had fought theGermans for four months and, when their work was done, they came home againby air. His experience showed that troops must be blooded in battle. If youdid not blood your troops you had no idea what their value was.THE PRIME MINISTER enquired whether Stalin had ever asked himselfwhy Hitler did not come to England in 1940, when we had only 20,000 trainedtroops, 200 guns and 50 tanks; and when Hitler had everything he needed :landing craft, barges, tanks, guns, planes, &amp;c. He did not come. If he had come, he (the Prime Minister) would not be here to tell the tale. The fact wasthat Hitler was afraid of the operation.M. STALIN said that this was no analogy. The landing of Hitler inEngland would have been resisted by the people, whereas in the case of a Britishlanding in France the people would be on the side of the British.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was all the more important, therefore,not to expose the people of France, by a withdrawal, to the vengeance of hitler and to waste them when they would be needed in the big operation in 1943.M. STALIN (who looked glummer still) said that if we could not make a landing in France this year he was not entitled to demand it or to insist upon it, but he was bound to say that he did not agree with Mr. Churchill&apos;s arguments.THE PRIME MINISTER thanked him, and said he hoped Stalin would allow the Generals to go into details.M. STALIN agreed, and said that of course the military experts must be consulted, but it was not for them to decide, it was Mr. Churchill and himself to decide.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed.4. THE PRIME MINISTER then brought out a map of SouthernEurope, the Mediterranean and North Africa. What was a second front? he asked. Was it only a landing on a fortified coast opposite England \ Or couldit take the form of some other great operations which might be useful to the
common cause ? Suppose we did this or that at Cherbourg or the Pas de Calais(and here Mr. Churchill pointed to a map which he had drawn himself), thatwould not engage a great force of the enemy. If we could hold the enemy atthis point or that and at the same time attack elsewhere, for instance, in theLoire, the Gironde or the Scheldt, this was full of promise and success. Thatwas indeed what had been planned for 1943. That was in fact a general picture of next year&apos;s big operation.M. STALIN feared that it was not practicable.THE Prime MINISTER said that it would indeed be difficult to landa million men, but that we should have to persevere and to try.Here the conversation covered somewhat old ground about air predominanceover the Pas de Calais, &amp;c, and M. STALIN remarked that even the besttrained troops could not do without trenches, and they either had to have prepared trenches or air predominance.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed about air predominance, and said thatfor this reason we and the Americans were building large numbers of aircraft carriers.M. STALIN remarked that aircraft carriers were no good near the coast.The point was to drive the Germans out of France and to create a French front.The Germans should be deprived of Belgian and French industries and then theywould collapse.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed and said that this was why we werebombing the German centres of industry, and said that the present bombing was nothing to what would be done in six months, or even in three months&apos; time.M. STALIN agreed that this bombing was of tremendous importance. some military experts were inclined to underrate its effects, but he did not. It was notonly German industry that should be bombed, but the population too. This wasthe only way of breaking German morale. In six months from now the situation might be quite different. The Germans might be on the Volga and able to with-draw from Russia sixty divisions. Now they had almost nothing in the west.Their whole forces were engaged in Russia.THE PRIME MINISTER reiterated his statement about nine gooddivisions, of which three were armoured.M. STALIN threw out more doubts and said that &quot;the Germans were very good at giving false information to Allied agents. They were swindlers andblackmailers and they were masters of the trick of muddling up divisions.THE PRIME MINISTER said that if he were wrong he would be glad. Asregards the civil population, we looked upon its morale as a military target. Wesought no mercy and we would show no mercy.M. STALIN said that that was the only way.THE PRIME MINISTER said that we hoped to shatter twenty Germancities as we had shattered Cologne, lubeck , dusseldorf, and so on. More andmore aeroplanes and bigger and bigger bombs. M. Stalin had heard of 2-tonbombs. We had now begun to use 4-ton bombs, and this would be continued throughout the winter. If need be, as the war went on, we hoped to shatteralmost every dwelling in almost every German city. (These words had a verystimulating effect upon the meeting, and thenceforward the atmosphere becameprogressively more cordial.)M. STALIN smiled and said that would not be bad..    THE PRIME MINISTER replied that it would be better still.M. STALIN suggested that the four-ton bombs should be dropped withparachutes, otherwise they dug themselves into the ground.5. THE PRIME MINISTER then reverted to the question of a second front in 1942, which, he said, was what he had come for. He did not thinkFrance was the only place for such an operation. There were other places, andwe and the Americans had decided upon another operation, which he was authorised by the American President to impart to Stalin secretly. He would now proceed to do so.  (At this M. Stalin sat up and grinned.)M. STALIN hoped that nothing about it would appear in the British press.
THE PRIME MINISTER replied that he wished he could control theBritish press as MJ. Stalin controlled the Soviet press.M. STALIN said that Mr. Churchill had quite enough powers to exercise control whenever he wished to.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the best means of cloaking this operation, which henceforward he would call &quot; Torch,&quot; would be to confuse it with other operations. &quot; Torch &quot; would be under an American commander, whohad already been appointed and was now in England. The operation consisted of the seizing of the North Coast of French Africa the whole of it (Stalinshowed great interest). Two hundred and fifty thousand men had been set aside for this purpose : 7 divisions of American troops and 5 divisions of Britishtroops. The operation would be on that basis, as 7 was to 5. The troops wouldbe landed at Casablanca, Oran, Algiers and, if possible, Bizerta. Probably Stalinwould ask how you could land there and not land in this part of the world, andMr. Churchill pointed to Northern France.M. STALIN asked when the operation would begin and quickly followedthis question by saying that he was prepared to withdraw if it was embarrassing.THE PRIME MINISTER replied &quot;No.&quot; He was going to tell Stalinnow that the President had fixed the 30th October as the latest date. Since hehad seen the President everyone concerned had been trying to advance that date to the first week in October.M. STALIN asked if this would not involve a war with France and Spain.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that it would not do so if the operationwere carried out in large enough force and under the American flag. It might bring the French fleet over, but we could not count upon that. We expected no more than half-hearted resistance from the French.M. STALIN asked what about Spain.THE PRIME MINISTER replied by asking why Hitler himself had notinvaded Spain. That was because he was afraid of another hostile population onhis hands.M. STALIN said that when Hitler began the war he had advised Mussolini toremain neutral so as to keep Germany supplied. Now he was using Spain for thesame purpose and even for submarine bases.THE PRIME MINISTER said he did not think so. We were strictlyrationing supplies to Spain. The &quot; Torch &quot; operation had been planned for october because it was not thought that Hitler would be able to move troops fromthe Pas de Calais in time to stop it.M. STALIN asked whether Spain would not make war.THE PRIME MINISTER said he did not think so. If Spain did go to warGermany would have to defend her. We could land troops much more easily in spain than in France.M. STALIN suggested that it would be difficult to find political reasons tojustify an attack on North Africa and asked about General Weygand. It wouldbe much easier to justify a landing in France.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he could justify a landing in north africa and described the military advantages of freeing the Mediterranean,whence still another front could be opened. In September we must win in Egypt,and in October in North Africa, all the time holding the enemy in Northern France&apos;.If we could end the year in possession of North Africa we could threaten thebelly of Hitler&apos;s Europe (Stalin&apos;s interest quickened), and this operation shouldbe considered in conjunction with the 1943 operation. That was what we andthe Americans had decided to do. Mr. Churchill then invited Mr. Harrimanto speak.Mr. HARRIMAN said that he could add little to the broad picture thePrime Minister had drawn. The President was in full agreement with the PrimeMinister on the decisions reached. He was pressing for as early a date as possiblefor &quot; Torch.&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER, who had meanwhile drawn a picture of acrocodile, explained to M. Stalin with the help of this picture how it was our intention to attack the soft belly of the crocodile as we attacked his hard snout.
Mr. HARRIMAN said that, in spite of the fact that the President hadserious preoccupations in the Pacific, his eyes were turned upon the Europeantheatre of war as of primary concern. He would support it to the limit of theresources at his disposal.M. STALIN said: &quot;May God help this enterprise to succeed.&quot; (his interest was now at a high pitch.)THE PRIME MINISTER said that we wanted to take the strain off theRussians. If we attempted that in Northern France we should meet with a rebuff.If we tried in North Africa we had a good chance of victory and then we could help in Europe. If we could get North Africa, Hitler would have to bring hisair force back or otherwise we would destroy his allies, even, for instance, Rome,and make a landing. The operation would have an important influence on turkey and on the whole of Southern Europe, and all he was afraid of was that we mightbe forestalled. If North Africa were won this year we could make a deadly attack upon Hitler next year.M. STALIN asked about the French army in North Africa.THE PRIME MINISTER said it consisted of seven divisions which we hoped we could overcome, as we had done in Madagascar. The effect upon Spainwould be good, and the Spaniards might be encouraged by being given a littlemore here, and he pointed to Spanish Morocco.M. STALIN asked if there was now a free passage for ships through theStraits of Gibraltar.THE PRIME MINISTER said &quot; Yes.&quot; A large squadron of ships had passed through the Straits a few days ago bound for Malta, where the populationof 30,000 had food for only two months more. It was essential to get supplies tothem. We had sent two battleships, three aircraft-carriers (of which one hadbeen sunk), thirty destroyers, eight to ten cruisers and fourteen merchantmen.To keep Malta supplied was a difficult problem, but it was one which would solveitself if we were masters of the North African coast. Before he left Moscowhe would know whether there would be good news or bad news about the fate ofthis convoy. The passage at Gibraltar presented no difficulties. The PrimeMinister went on to show Stalin on the map how he had flown from London to cairo via Gibraltar.M. STALIN asked whether the Spaniards could make difficulties.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that the &quot;Torch &quot; operation would havea deterrent effect upon Spain.6. THE PRIME MINISTER then turned to the question of the Russiansouthern flank and said that he and President Roosevelt had been turning overin their minds the question of helping in the defence of the Caspian Sea and theCel. cIC3.SU. S. Nothing definite had been decided, but he and the President thoughtthat if we could put a powerful Anglo-American air force into Northern Persiathat would help both us and the Russians. The Caucasian Mountains and the neutrality of Turkey were matters of material importance to us in that theyshielded the oil of Abadan, the loss of which would threaten our whole position inIndia and the Middle East (M. Stalin&apos;s interest flagged a little). It was notpossible to make any definite proposal, but M. Stalin should understand that wemust first win the battle in Egypt.THE PRIME MINISTER concluded by asking how this idea appealed toM. Stalin, adding that, if M. Stalin liked it, he and Mr. Harriman would communicate with the President at once.M. STALIN said he would be glad to accept, subject to agreement on certain points of detail.Mr. HARRIMAN explained that the President was much interested, but itwas a project to be studied not a proposal.7. THE PRIME MINISTER then said there was only one more thing, andthat was about &quot;Torch.&quot; Clever people had been talking on the lines of&quot; Torch &quot; for some time past. Our aim was to pretend that we were going to strike at^ the Pas de Calais. every day the Germans could for themselves seepreparations which suggested this. It was of the utmost importance that nothing should be said or done to indicate that we were hot going to attackHitler in France.   At the present moment there were 350 German bombers
waiting to resist our landing when it came. Hitler would remove these for workelsewhere if he had the least idea we were not going to make a landing.Mr. Churchill went on to say that he proposed this month, if the weather were favourable, to make a raid on France on a large scale in order to seek information and to test the German resistance. We might lose as many as 10,000 men on this operation, which would be no more than a reconnaissance. Another means ofconfusing the Germans would be a sham attack on Norway. No attack would bemade, but we were going, on pretending that we were aiming at it. Severaldivisions, indeed, were being fitted out with Arctic equipment in order to suggest to the Germans that our intentions lay towards Norway.M. STALIN asked if there would be any leakage about &quot; Torch.&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER replied that there might be leakages, but therewould be other leakages and this was another reason for early action. (By this time M. Stalin was very cheerful.)M. STALIN asked if &quot; Torch &quot; was aimed against the Germans.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was against Germany&apos;s weakest ally.It would probably result in the German seizure of unoccupied France, but he didnot care whether they threw Petain into the sea or not. He invited M. Stalin toconsider what he had said and to have another talk later. Meanwhile, military experts on both sides could discuss matters of detail.8. M. STALIN then asked if General de Gaulle had been told of what was intended.  .THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had not told him, or rather that,when recently General de Gaulle had asked a direct question, he had replied thathe had no such intention.Mr. HARRIMAN here interjected that there was bound to be talk of a movement on North Africa. When Laval came into power the French in north africa had all expected an attack and talk in this sense had persisted. He hoped,therefore, that any fresh talk would not be taken seriously.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, in any case, other gossip would beput out.M. STALIN asked whether he could feel sure that the occupation would onlybe temporary.THE PRIME MINISTER said &quot;Yes.&quot; He doubted whether the french would fire on the American flag if the Americans said : &apos;&apos; We come to liberateFrance.&quot;   (M. Stalin&apos;s interest was again at a high pitch.)M. STALIN explained that he had asked this because he was very doubtful about the French attitude.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that success was the only answer tothis : If the Americans came to liberate France, France would not declare war.Mr. HARRIMAN explained that he did not think any Frenchman would see in &quot; Torch &quot; a wish on the part of the United States to annex North Africa.The President was well informed. The American Agents in that country hadbeen reporting for some time that an overwhelming majority of the populationwas anxious for the Americans to come. Also Admiral Leahy, now his Chief ofStaff, had just returned from Vichy.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV asked what would be the attitude ofGeneral de Gaulle.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that General de Gaulle would probablydo what he told him to do. He thought that General de Gaulle would be persuaded to help in Egypt. At this stage they did not wish General de Gaulleto intervene in the &quot; Torch &quot; operation. The French were likely to fire onde Gaulle, but they would be unlikely to fire on the Americans.M. STALIN expressed some doubts about the political soundness of&quot; Torch.&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER replied that he would like to discuss.this later to convince M. Stalin that the American flag would be considered to be a beginning of the liberation of France by the American army. If we were advisedlater that General de Gaulle would be a help, then we would use him, but at thepresent we thought he would be a hindrance. ;  v
Mr. HARRIMAN said that de Gaulle would antagonise many Frenchmenand it would mean a civil war.M. STALIN suggested that if the operation were entrusted to de Gaulleit would have the effect of gathering French help, but if it&apos;were in american and British hands the French would be antagonised.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this had all been very carefullythought out.Mr. HARRIMAN then said that people in North Africa were suspicious of de Gaulle&apos;s political aspirations, whereas they were not in the least suspicious of the Americans. When the time came de Gaulle would be taken care of. Hewas not being repudiated, but the fact was that he talked too much. Witnesswhat had happened at Dakar, which enterprise had been ruined by indiscreet talkby the Free French.M STALIN said that he himself was not in favour of de Gaulle, but it was important to show that the operation was undertaken in the interest of France,otherwise the French might think that it was being undertaken by the americans in their own interest.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it would be made clear from thebeginning that it was the first step in the deliverance of France, and that he felt sure many Frenchmen would come over.M. STALIN at this point seemed suddenly to grasp the strategic advantages of &quot; Torch.&quot;   He saw four outstanding advantages : (1) It would take the enemy in the rear.(2) It would make the Germans and French fight each other.(3) It would put Italy out of action.(4) It would keep the Spaniards neutral.It was a good scheme, he said, but he would like to see it put on a sounder politicalbasis.THE PRIME MINISTER then said: &quot;France is down and we want tocheer her up.&quot; France had understood Madagascar and Syria. The arrival ofthe Americans would send the French over to our side. It would intimidateFranco. The Germans might well say at once to the French give us your fleet andToulon.Mr. HARRIMAN here asked if M. Stalin was concerned that it would be misunderstood in the U.S.S.R.M. STALIN replied that he could explain it in the Soviet press as a military necessity.Mr. HARRIMAN said that the President was not afraid of the political aspects of &apos;&apos; Torch &apos;&apos; with the French people, but he understood that if he didnot go about it carefully it might be misunderstood in the United States.THE PRIME MINISTER said that we were not afraid of the political aspects of &quot; Torch &quot; either, and with this M. Stalin seemed satisfied.The meeting then gathered round a globe and the Prime Minister explained to M. Stalin the immense advantages of clearing the enemy out of the Mediter-ranean arid, in his turn, Mr. Harriman pointed out how much the present longhauls round the Cape would be shortened.The meeting, which had lasted from 7 p.m. to 10-40 p.m., then broke up.ANNEX II.Note of an Interview between the Prime Minister and M. Molotov on Augtcst 13at 12 noon.The Prime Minister -gave the latest news of the naval battle in theCentral Mediterranean, and said that by now the ships would be getting air coverfrom Malta. He said that he thought M. Stalin would be interested to have the news, and asked M. Molotov to tell M. Stalin, when passing on .the information,that we had been prepared to pay a certain price in this connection.[24254] c
M. Molotov asked about the operations in the Solomon Islands. ThePrime Minister said the operation was not a large one, but it might be called asubstantial one. It forms the beginning of the American offensive in the Pacific,and there had been some hard fighting.The Prime Minister suggested further discussion on the &quot; Torch&quot;operation, but M. Molotov said it would be better to discuss this matter withM. Stalin, who could obtain the views of the military experts and consider thequestion as a whole.The Prime Minister remarked : I think I am a pretty good judge of whatthe reactions will be in France and in Vichy France, and certainly the Americansknow French North Africa well.An exchange of views followed as to the effect this operation would have onFranco-German relations, and there was agreement that there might be serious repercussions. The Prime Minister explained that we had an idea of raising theFrench flag in connection with some local general, or over a prominent general who came over from France.The Prime Minister then asked if M. Molotov considered yesterday&apos;s talkssatisfactory.M. Molotov said there had been ambiguity about certain points. It hadobviously been decided not to create a second front in Europe in 1942, and therewas no absolute certainty about the &quot; Torch &quot; operation taking place. On thewhole, there was considerable ambiguity. The Prime Minister assuredM. Molotov that preparations for this latter operation were proceeding with allpossible speed, and the latest date for it to take place was 80 days hence, but60 &quot;days was a possibility.M. Molotov dwelt on the situation on the Eastern front and said it was far worse than in May or June. He said they were anxious something shouldbe done to relieve the pressure on this side.The arrival of the plane due to-day was touched upon, and M. Molotov gave an assurance it would be speeded up.The Prime Minister referred to yesterday&apos;s conversation and said thathe had not wished to convey the impression that decisions in Britain were madeby the military authorities.  It was the War Cabinet which made decisions.The Prime Minister then gave a general idea of operations intended nextyear and explained that, in addition to the &apos;&apos; Torch &apos;&apos; operation, there would beseveral large raids this year. He stated that, according to plans, a million menwere due to arrive from the United States by the 1st April, but some delaywas very likely. Following that, reinforcements would arrive at the rate&apos; of100,000 per month.M. Molotov raised the question of an expedition to Northern Norway,and the Prime Minister said he was still keen on this operation, but it could onlyplay the part of a sham for many months. He said Soviet forces could not possibly be spared for this purpose in view of the present situation at the front.M. Molotov added : &apos;&apos; Mr. Churchill should understand our feelings and our desire that something should be done to relieve the situation on our front.&quot; Whenthe communique on his visit to the West was published it had caused better spiritsin the population and the army and a rush of good feeling towards the UnitedKingdom and the United States.The Prime Minister emphasised that, though he anticipated no political difficulties at home in connection with the failure to establish a second front in Europe, it was important that no discussion in Parliament, even in secret Session, should take place on the subject, as that might enable the germans to discover that there was to be no second front in Europe in 1942. They wouldderive advantage from such knowledge. The Prime Minister said that we should endeavour to preserve.unity of action and not let any disappointments affect this.He sought to establish the same sort of mutual understanding with M. Stalin asexisted between him and President Roosevelt.There was some discussion on the form of the communique which was to beissued, and on the time of its issue.The Prime Minister stated his intention of leaving on Saturday evening or,at the latest, on Sunday morning.
ANNEX III.Minutes of a Meeting held in the Kremlin, Moscow, on Thursday,August 13, 1942, at 11-15 p.m.Present :The Right Hon. Winston S. Churchill,Prime Minister of Great Britain.Mr. A. Harriman, representative of thePresident of the United States ofAmerica.Sir Alexander Cadogan, permanent under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.General Sir Archibald Wavell, Com-mander-in-Chief, India.General Sir Alan Brooke, Chief of theImperial General Staff.Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder,Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Middle East.$ *  t&amp;T &apos;atColonel E. I. C. Jacob.Interpreters.  -M. Pavlov.Mr. Dunlop.M. STALIN said that he had endeavoured to sum up the situation whichhad resulted from the previous day&apos;s conversation, and he communicated to thePrime Minister and Mr. Harriman copies of an Aide-Memoire* of which atranslation was read.Mr. CHURCHILL said that he would in due course make a written replyto this Aide-Memoire. The plans of which M. Stalin had been informedyesterday had been the subject of careful examination by the United States andBritish Governments for the past few months and represented the best that couldbe offered. He was ready to agree that the whole matter should be discussed indetail by the technical advisers. On our sfde, we should be able to give the fullreasons which had led to our conclusions. He said that he found the last sentence of M. Stalin&apos;s memorandum correct. The British and American governments had deliberately reached these conclusions and had submitted them to the SovietGovernment as their final statement of intention. He hoped, however, to be ableto show that the course on which decision had finally been taken would be thebest way of giving assistance to Russia. It would be no help to Russia, if theUnited Nations were to do something that would lead simply to disaster involvingthem in profitless loss.He hoped that this phase of the discussion might now be left behind (apartfrom military examination of the detail), and it might be possible to proceed toother important and constructive questions.He asked Mr. Harriman whether he could make any statement on behalf ofthe President of the United States.Mr. HARRIMAN said that the position as explained on the preceding-night to M. Stalin had been the subject of very careful examination by the Britishand American Governments a few weeks ago. The conclusions reached were reached with the Presidents agreement. The President had a great determina-tion to use all resources as early as possible in the most effective way for theUnited Nations, and the decisions reached represented considered conclusions.These conclusions were in the interest of the Soviet cause, and the President was prepared for any sacrifice which offered a reasonable prospect of success.* Annex.M. Stalin, President of the People&apos;sCommissars of the U.S.S.R.M. Molotov, Principal Commissar forForeign Affairs.[24254]
M. STALIN said that, if, as he assumed, Mr. Harriman was speaking of the&quot; Torch &quot; project, this operation did not concern the Soviet directly. From themilitary point of view it was doubtless a correct operation, but, as far as thesecond front was concerned, there was a difference of view as to the importanceof the Russian front. This front, in his view, was of first-rate importance, while he understood the British and American Governments held it to be only of secondary importance.THE PRIME MINISTER protested that this was not the case.Continuing, M. STALIN said that, from the military point of view, theoperation &quot; Torch &quot; was correct, though he said he thought it was not sufficientlyprepared from the political point of view.Mr. CHURCHILL said that the technical details of the plan should befurther examined between the experts. This would show why, in the circum-stances, &quot; Torch &quot; was the better operation and would explain more fully thedifficulties in the way of an operation against the French coast.In reply to a question from M. Stalin as to what particular pointscould be discussed, Mr. Churchill said that explanations could be given of thedifficulties confronting any attempt on the Continent by a study of the limitationsgoverning action by fighter aircraft, the numbers of landing craft available thisyear, the number of troops that could be transported across the Channel, thestrength of German fortifications, the quality and numbers of German troops inthe West and the facts about the German Air Force in the West. This studywould show the injury which any premature effort would inflict on next year&apos;sgreat operation. The British view was that any premature attempt would resultin disaster.M. STALIN said that he had no objection to technical discussions on theselines being initiated. He was in favour of close liaison between the militaryauthorities, but he was bound to state that, if there was to be no second front, he did not quite see what would be the advantage of them. As regards &quot; Torch,&quot;the Soviet Government were not directly concerned.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was anxious that full explanationshould be given to show why the British Government were assured that &apos;&apos; Torch&apos;&apos;would assist the Soviet Government, and would be, in fact, the only active military operation that could have this effect this autumn.M. STALIN agreed that every blow against the Axis afforded some relief.As to supplies, he said that the Soviet Government were grateful for suppliesalready received and those promised for the future. But he must say that,although many plans had been drawn up, several of these had had to be abandoned,so that, as a result, the Soviet Government had obtained little from the UnitedStates and Great Britain. He did not wish to make a complaint, but felt boundto state the fact.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the British Government had done their utmost. Fifteen convoys had got through to Russia without great loss. The16th and 17th had been heavily attacked, and only a proportion had arrived only one-third out of the 17th convoy. It was now proposed to run a furtherone in September, and he hoped it would be a large one. But M. Stalin should know that the operation &quot; Torch&quot; would affect the convoy position. He couldnot say at the moment to what extent, but he wished M. Stalin to know the worstand not complain afterwards that things had been concealed from him.M. STALIN said that the promises which were made ought to be carriedout. Four million, four hundred thousand tons was the amount promised, butthe programme was falling behind. He was grateful for the supplies which hadbeen sent in the past, but, if a programme were made, it should be adhered to,otherwise confusion must result.Mr. CHURCHILL said that the promise was for delivery at our ports. Wehad done our best but the enemy had effectively intervened.M. STALIN disagreed with the statement that the fall in supplies had been caused by the action of the enemy. He suggested that the cause was an under-estimate of the importance of the Russian front. This led to supplies only being-given from the remnant of equipment which could be spared.Mr. CHURCHILL repudiated this suggestion. There were a hundred shipswaiting full of cargo for the Russians. The only question was how these ships could be brought safely to Russian ports.
1324Mr. HARRIMAN supported Mr. Churchill, and said that in the UnitedStates supplies for Russia had overriding priority.M. STALIN suggested that higher sacrifices were called for. Ten thousandmen a day were being sacrificed on the&apos; Russian front. The Germans had280 divisions, including 25 armoured divisions, on that front. The Russians didnot complain of the sacrifices they were making, but the extent of them should berecognised.Mr. CHURCHILL said that he envied the Russians their glory, and he hoped that we very soon would show by our deeds that the Democracies wereneither sluggish nor cowardly and were just as ready as the Russians to shedblood. The only question was as to the right action which they should take. Theexistence of the oceans and the need to move over them in ships were facts forwhich it hardly seemed right that we should be reproached.He earnestly desired to hear the ring of comradeship in the discussions. Hewell knew what the Russians were going through; we ourselves had fought alonefor a year. But now we had two great nations by our side Russia and theUnited States of America. We thus were certain of victory, and held the powerto shape the future of the world. He had come a long way in the hope that hewould receive the hand of comradeship and that he would be believed jn a spiritof loyalty and friendship. If, by the loss of 150,000 British and Americansoldiers on the shores of France, real help could be given to Russia and somethinguseful achieved, the Americans and the British would not hesitate to give, theorder. No one would profit, however, by a foolish enterprise. It grieved hisheart to think that the Russians did not think that we were doing our utmost inthe common cause.M. STALIN said that it was not a case of mistrust, but only of a divergence of view. His view was that it should be possible for the British and americans to land six or eight divisions on the Cherbourg Peninsula, since they haddomination of the air. He felt that if the British Army had been fighting the-Germans as much as the Russian Army, it would not be so frightened of them.The Russians, and indeed the R.A.F., had shown that it was possible to beat theGermans. The British infantry could do the same provided they acted at thesame time as the Russians.Mr. CHURCHILL said that he pardoned the remark which M. Stalin had made on account of the bravery of the Russian Army. The proposal for a landing in Cherbourg overlooked the existence of the Channel.M. STALIN then referred to the transfer of the Tirpitz to Northern waterswhere it was near to the route of convoys to Russia. He suggested that as therewould be little space for the German ships to manoeuvre when attacking these convoys, an ambush could be prepared in which the Soviet Air Force could take part. He felt that this would be a more advantageous line of action than allowing the ships to scatter.M. STALIN then made a request that there should be a full interchange ofinformation about the latest models of military equipment. He gave details ofthree new mortars which had been developed by the Russian Army and whichwere of particular value, in one case against fortified positions of the typeconstimcted by the Germans, and, in another case, against infantry. He saidthat he was quite ready to provide details of these mortars, but would like detailsof our inventions in exchange. He suggested that it would be desirable to cometo an agreement on these matters.Mr. CHURCHILL said that there was only one class of British inventionwhich it would be necessary to withhold from the Russians. There were certain types of equipment fitted in aircraft which, if they fell into the hands of germans, would enable them to make the bombing of Germany much moredifficult than at present. This type of equipment must never be used anywherewhere it might fall into German hands by being flown over the lines. Apartfrom this, he was prepared to give freely information on all our inventions. Hewas quite prepared to make an agreement, but he would not press, the russians to disclose anything that they wished to withhold.M. STALIN said that the mortars could be demonstrated to the british military authorities forthwith, and Sir Alan Brooke welcomed this proposal.There was a pause, and M. Stalin then abruptly invited Mr. Churchill to dinewith him the following day, so indicating that he considered the conversationsconcluded.
Mr. CHURCHILL thanked M. Stalin for the frank discussion which hadtaken place, and he hoped that M. Stalin would feel that the talk had been helpful.He suggested that the military authorities should meet on the following day and go carefully into the matters which had been discussed. The Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff would be prepared to give full reasons, if desired, for our proposedactions. There were certain matters of a political nature which he thought could best be discussed by M. Molotov and Sir Alexander Cadogan. It would benecessary to consider how to get best value from publicity for his visit, and how to cause most irritation to the enemy. He thanked M. Stalin for hisinvitation to dinner the following evening, which he gratefully accepted. Hethought it would be advisable if he left at daylight the morning after. He alsothanked M. Stalin for the arrangements which had been made for his comfort and safety.  Mr. Harriman associated himself with this statement.M, STALIN agreed that the military authorities should meet, and agreedthat M. Molotov and Sir Alexander Cadogan who were already wellacquainted should discuss political questions. With regard to publicity, he pointed out that it had been intended to irritate the Germans by the publicationof the joint communique on the occasion of M. Molotov&apos;s visit to London. the communique had, however, served in the opposite sense, since the promise whichit, contained had not been fulfilled.Mr. CHURCHILL rejected this insinuation, and drew attention to the aide-memoire which he had given M. Molotov, and which expressly stated thatno promise could be made about a second front in 1942.M. STALIN said that the aide-memoire was not published, but the com-munique was.   A similar mistake must not be made again.Mr. CHURCHILL said that he was not asking for any favours, and would agree to any form of announcement which might be thought best. It might even be thought best to make no announcement. He suggested that M. Molotov andSir Alexander Cadogan should draft a statement for consideration.This was agreed to.M. STALIN enquired if it was necessary for Mr. Churchill to leave so soon.Mr. CHURCHILL said that he was quite prepared to stay another day if agood purpose could be served thereby.Continuing, he said that there was one more point to which he wished torefer. .He did not want to press for disclosure of military movements or resources,but he felt that it was necessary to know what were the Russian intentions withregard to the defence of the Caucasus mountains. We were trying to build up anarmy in Persia and Iraq and to make available an air force to support theRussians on the Caucasus front. It was, therefore, necessary for us to know what the prospects were, so that the best possible action could be taken.M. STALIN explained, with the help of a relief model of the Caucasusmountains, the routes through which the Germans might attempt to penetratesouthwards, and the dispositions made by the Russians to resist them. He saidthat all the passages were fortified and held. The Russian front line lay some-what in advance of the foothills. He said that it was untrue that the germans had captured Maikop, but the oilfields and machinery there had been destroyed,so that the Germans would not be able to draw oil from that place for six or eight months. Demolitions had also been carried out at Grozny, so that if it was not held, it too could be destroyed. The Germans would have great difficulty in getting to Baku, but steps had been taken to meet any threat either by an advancedown the coastal strip or by a turning movement through Batum. The russians had twenty-five divisions in the Caucasus and one tank brigade, but the country was generally unsuitable for the use of tanks. He was doubtful of the attitudeof Turkey, where a new Government was in power. If Turkey did not remainneutral, it would mean redisposing the Russian forces to meet an attack fromthat quarter, but he was confident that he would be able to smash the Turks. TheRussians would not take the initiative in attacking them./ Mr. CHURCHILL said that he did not think that Turkey would abandonneutrality, though much would depend on a successful outcome of the battle in libya. &quot; Torch,&quot; too, would have a decisive effect. He thanked M. Stalin forthe very important statement he had made, and said that, if the Russians could hold the Caucasus until the winter, we should be able to build up strong air forces to help them.  He felt that this was one of the questions the military authorities
should study. He had asked Air Chief Marshal Tedder to prepare a plan forthe employment of seventeen squadrons on this front.M. STALIN observed that we had promised six squadrons to operate in theNorth, but these had not been forthcoming.Mr. CHURCHILL pointed out that there was no method at present bywhich they could be moved to their destination. He did not want to have themdrowned. He then thanked M. Stalin for the release of 40 Bostons which werein transit in Iraq for the Russians.M. STALIN said that these were American aircraft. It would be timeenough to thank the Russians when they gave some of their own bombers to theBritish.  He enquired what the British production of aircraft now amounted to.Mr. CHURCHILL said that at present it was about 2,000 aircraft a month,including trainers.Mr. HARRIMAN said that the American output was about 4,000 aircraft month, including trainers.M. STALIN said that Russian output was now 1,800 fighting planes amonth, plus 600 trainers.Mr. CHURCHILL observed that the combined output was thus some three times greater than that of the Axis.M. STALIN said that everything in war depended on the skill with whichthe forces were employed and the manner in which they were commanded.Mr. HARRIMAN enquired whether the Russians were satisfied with the plans which had been made for delivering aircraft via Siberia.M. STALIN said that wars were not won by making plans and, so far, noaircraft had been delivered by this route.SIR ARTHUR TEDDER said that it was, however, necessary to make plansif action were to be effective, and.he hoped that it would be possible for plans tobe concerted and reconnaissance to be made for the move of his squadrons to theCaucasus.Mr. CHURCHILL hoped that Air Chief Marshal Tedder might be placedin touch with the appropriate Russian authorities to study this point.Moscow, August 15, 1942.Translation of an Aide-Memoire handed by M. Stalin to Mr. Churchill andMr. Harriman.As the result of an exchange of views in Moscow which took place on the12th August of this year, I ascertained that the Prime Minister of Great Britain,Mr. Churchill, considered that the organisation of a second front in Europe in1942 to be impossible.As is well known, the organisation of a second front in Europe in 1942was pre-decided during the sojourn of Molotov in London, and it foundexpression in the agreed Anglo-Soviet communique published on the 12th june last.It is also known that the organisation of a second front in Europe had as its object the withdrawal of German forces from the Eastern front to the West,and the creation in the West of a serious base of resistance to the German-Fascistforces and the affording of relief by this means to the situation of the soviet forces on the Soviet-German front in 1942.It will be easily understood that the Soviet Command built their plan ofsummer and autumn operations calculating on the creation of a second front inEurope in 1942.It is easy to grasp that the refusal of the Government of Great Britain tocreate a second front in 1942 in Europe inflicts a moral blow to the whole of theSoviet public opinion, which calculates on the creation of a second front, and thatit complicates the situation of the Red Army at the front and prejudices theplan of the Soviet Command.
I am not referring to the fact that the difficulties arising for the Red army as the result of the refusal to create a second front in 1942 will undoubtedly haveto deteriorate the military situation of England and all the remaining Allies.It appears to me and my colleagues that the most favourable conditions exist in 1942 for the creation of a second front in Europe, inasmuch as almost all theforces of the German army, and the best forces to boot, have been withdrawn tothe Eastern front, leaving in Europe an inconsiderable amount of forces and theseof inferior quality. It is unknown whether the year of 1943 will offer conditions for the creation of a second front as favourable as 1942. We are of the opinion,therefore, that it is particularly in 1942 that the creation of a second front inEurope is possible and should be effected. I was, however, unfortunatelyunsuccessful in convincing Mr. Prime Minister of Great Britain hereof, while Mr. Harriman, the representative of the President of the United States, fully supported Mr. Prime Minister in the negotiations held in Moscow.(Signed) J. STALIN.August 13, 1942.ANNEX IV.Aide-memoire.In reply to Premier Stalin&apos;s aide-memoire of the 13th August, the PrimeMinister of Great Britain states : 1. The best second front in 1942, and the only large-scale operation possible from the Atlantic, is &quot; Torch.&quot; If this can be effected in October it will give more aid to Russia than any other plan. It also prepares the way for 1943 andhas the four advantages mentioned by Premier Stalin in the conversation of the12th August. The British and United States Governments have made up their minds about this and all preparations are proceeding with the utmost speed.2. Compared with &quot;Torch,&quot; the attack with six or eight Anglo-american divisions on the Cherbourg Peninsula and the Channel Islands would be ahazardous and futile operation. The Germans have enough troops in the west to block us in this narrow peninsula with fortified lines, and would concentrateall their air forces in the West upon it. In the opinion of all the British Naval,Military and Air authorities, the operation could only end in disaster. Even ifthe lodgement were made, it would not bring a single division back from Russia.It would also be far more a running sore for us than for the enemy, and would use up wastefully and wantonly the key men and the landing craft required forreal action in 1943. This is our settled view. The Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff will go into details with the Russian Commanders to any extent that may be desired.3. No promise has been broken by Great Britain or the United States. Ipoint to paragraph 5 of my aide-memoire given to M. Molotov on the 10th June,1942, which distinctly says: &quot;We can, therefore, give no promise.&quot; Thisaide-memoire followed upon lengthy conversations, in which the very smallchance of such a plan being adopted was made abundantly clear. Several ofthese conversations are on record.4. However, all the talk about an Anglo-American invasion of France thisyear has misled the enemy, and has held large air forces and considerable militaryforces on the French Channel coast. It would be injurious to all common interests, especially Russian interests, if any public controversy arose in whichit would be necessary for the British Government to unfold to the nation thecrushing arguments which they conceive themselves to possess against &quot; Sledge-hammer.&quot; Widespread discouragement would be caused to the Russian armieswho have been buoyed up on this subject, and the enemy would be free to with-draw further forces from the West. The wisest course is to use &quot; Sledgehammer &quot;as a blind for &quot; Torch,&quot; and proclaim &quot;Torch,&quot; when it.begins, as the second front.  This is what we ourselves mean to do.
5. We cannot admit that the conversations with M. Molotov about thesecond front, safeguarded as they were by reservations both oral and written,formed any ground for altering the strategic plans of the Russian high command.6. We reaffirm our resolve to aid our Russian Allies by ev^ry practicablemeans.W. S. C. ..August 14, 1942.ANNEX V.My dear M. Stalin, Moscow, Augtist 14, 1942.I have had an opportunity to study the memorandum of the 13th Augustyou handed me last night, an identical copy of which you simultaneously gave tothe Prime Minister. I have also had an opportunity to read the Prime Ministersaide-memoire of the 14th August replying to your memorandum.I do not believe that any useful purpose would be served in comments by meadditional to what the Prime Minister has said. I feel, however, that I mustreaffirm his statement that no promise has been broken regarding the second front.Sincerely yours,A. HARRIMAN.M. J. V. Stalin,President of the Council of people&apos;s Commissars of the U.S.S.R.,Moscow.ANNEX VI.Minutes of a Meeting held at Spiridonievka, 17, Moscow, at Noon on saturday, August 15, 1942.Present:General Sir Alan Brooke, Chief of the   Marshal Voroshilov.Imperial General Staff. Marshal Shaposhnikov.General    Sir   Archibald    Wavell,    Qpnpral VotjotjovCommander-in-Chief, India.Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder,Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Middle East.Major-General Maxwell, U.S. Army.Major-General Bradley, U.S. Army.Secretariat:Colonel E. I. C. Jacob.Colonel Shcherbakov.Interpreters:Major Birse.Engineer Captain Tiurin.; 1. Development of a Second Front in 1942.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV said that the object of the meeting was toconsider in greater detail the formation of a second front in Europe, in 1942.This had been discussed on the political plane, and it was now necessary to go into the military aspect.. He asked Sir Alan Brooke for his observations/[24254] - d
SIR ALAN BROOKE said that we thoroughly realised the desirability forming a second front at the earliest possible date, and had for a long timegiven it considerable study. The Prime Minister had himself pressed the matterforward. The principal factors which affected the conclusions which had beenreached as a result of this study were as follows : -(a) Forces available.There were at the present time about thirty divisions in the United Kingdomof which twenty were of a mobile type. The remaining ten were organised forthe static defence of the coastline. So far, only two United States divisions had arrived in the country, though a third was in transit.(b) Landing craft.For an operation of this kind, special landing craft were necessary, and sofar we had been very short of these. We only had enough to allow for the simultaneous landing of 3.000 men. The time which would elapse before furthermen could be landed would depend, of course, on the location of the landing placechosen for the operation.(c) Choice of landing place.It would, clearly be desirable to land where the maximum air cover could begiven, i.e., in Pas de Calais. The beaches in that area were very flat and the tidewent out 1\ to 2 miles. This meant that disembarkation would be difficult andthe turn round of the landing craft would be very slow.. After the initial landinghad been&apos; made, ports would be necessary for the disembarkation of heavy equipment and supplies. The only ports available in this area were Calais andBoulogne, both of which were small and narrow and easily blocked. Further Westat Cherbourg or Brest the ports had better facilities, but the air cover would notbe strong..The object of an operation on the Continent of Europe would be to drawtroops from the Russian front. With the forces available and with the landing craft at our disposal, six divisions at the outside could be put ashore. Such a force, with an uncertain line of communication, would not achieve much, seeing that the Germans had twenty-four divisions in France. Even allowing for someof these divisions being weak and composed of tired troops, it was most unlikelythat the Germans would draw anj^thing back from the Russian front to meet so small a threat. If, however, landing were successful, it would be very difficult tomaintain our forces in France throughout the winter. Taking these factors intoaccount, we had been forced to the conclusion that an operation in 1942 in france would be of no real assistance to the Russian front. Hence, we had turned toconsider alternative lines of action, and had decided on the establishment of adifferent kind of Western front in Africa rather than in Europe. Meanwhile,all preparations for the 1943 offensive were continuing. The coastline of theUnited Kingdom was being developed for offensive operations; landing craft and shipping were being collected on the South coast, which would convey theimpression that early invasion was likely. Raids on the French coast wouldaccentuate this impression. Meanwhile, our air offensive, was continuing at fullpressure.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV said that it was difficult for him to go into suchdetails as shipping and landing craft, but the situation on the Russian front,where German successes had continued for fourteen months, was such as to threaten not only Russia, but the other Allies. The German offensive was continuing on one of the most Vulnerable parts of the Eastern front and had notyet been brought to a standstill. The opening of a second front would relieve the pressure and would enable the Russians not only to stop the enemy, but to turn to the offensive. The Red Army was already carrying out successful offensive operations on several parts of the front. The German High Command knew thestrength of the Red Army and, consequently, threw all their forces against it,leaving the West bare. The twenty-four divisions in France and Belgium werenot fully equipped and did not really amount to much. The establishment ofa second front was not only necessary, but possible. He realised the difficultiesof landing operations, but the war could not be conducted without risk.Unexpected difficulties were often met with in war, but, similarly, it oftenhappened that dangers disappeared when put to the test. The British hadsuperiority in the air over the possible landing places. The British had alwaysbeen supreme at sea.  Surely, therefore, landing operations should be possible.
MARSHAL SHAPOSHNIKOV enquired why, if there were twenty-divisions in the United Kingdom, only six divisions could be moved to France ?Could not other types of ship be employed to augment the supply of landing craft and to expand the size of the assault ? It would certainly be necessary to considerother ports as well as Calais and Boulogne. Cherbourg and Brest should be easy to capture as only one night&apos;s voyage was required to reach them.He then drew a parallel between 1812 and the present time. In 1812 acomparatively small force in the Peninsula contained large forces that would otherwise have been sent to the Russian front. Now was the favourable time to strike; in the Spring it might be too late. Russian experience of landing-operations showed that they could be successful, particularly with air and navalsuperiority. He thought the United States should accelerate the flow of their troops to the United Kingdom, so as. to. increase the forces available. He did not regard raids as any kind of substitute for a second front. Qn the contrary, theywould give the Germans an indication that only small forces need to be left toguard their coast. He thought that the best way of ensuring the security of theBritish Isles would be by landings in France. The Channel Isles might &quot;be used as bases from which to give air cover West of the Pas de Calais.SIR ALAN BROOKE emphasised that we were fully aware of the strategicvalue of a Western front, but if it was to be of any value it must be effectivelyestablished. He did not think the Russians realised the difficulties of operatingacross the channel. An indication of these difficulties was the fact that in 1940,when we had only about twelve ill-equipped divisions and some 30 fighter squadrons with which to protect the British Isles, the Germans had been unableto invade. We had formed a special organisation to study the main problems of combined operations and to go into the matter very fully. The United states had also been very anxious to carry out an operation this year, and Admiral king and General Marshall had come to London to examine the matter. After muchstudy, they had accepted the British opinion. It was certainly true that warcould not be conducted without risk, but in all military operations there mustbe an object which had a reasonable chance of being attained. Our object, inthis case, would be to relieve the Russian front. We were quite prepared to sacrifice six or more divisions if by so doing we could achieve this object. after full study, however, we had found that we could not do so by means of a landing in France. We felt, however, that we had found a different method by which our purpose might be achieved.Experience showed that, in narrow waters, the advent of air power hadundermined supremacy at sea. This greatly affected operations in the english channel. With regard to the strength of forces available for operations, itshould not be forgotten that we had had several other fronts since the beginningof the war, e.g., France, Norway, Libya, Greece, Crete, East Africa, Syria, Iraq,Iran and the Far East. AH these activities had dispersed our forces and reduced our strength at home. Out of twenty divisions in the United Kingdom,only six had full equipment for continental operations. This was because somuch equipment had been shipped abroad, including much to Russia, The forcesin the United Kingdom had been primarily maintained for the defence of thecountry, and were consequently deficient of rear echelons and transport. We were now in process of making these good. It was true that an Army established inFrance would secure the United Kingdom, but if it were annihilated, we should then be without proper defences.MARSHAL SHAPOSHNIKOV observed that Suwarov had said that,when you take the offensive, you can let your rear look after itself.SIR ALAN BROOKE agreed, but pointed out that Suwarov had not had to operate across the sea. The whole of our strategy was affected by shortage ofshipping. We had to find convoys round the Cape, to the Middle East and India ;convoys from the United States to the United Kingdom with troops and rawmaterials; convoys to Russia; convoys across the Pacific to the Far East, We had done everything possible to make the maximum use of the shipping we had. even so, we were quite unable to move troops at the rate we should like to do.SIR ARTHUR TEDDER said that it was an over-statement to say that wehad air supreniaoy over Northern France. When we sent out a fighter sweep, ithad superiority for the ten to fifteen minutes it was over the area in France.That would not be adequate to cover, a great combined operation, over which air superiority must be continuous.
Sir Arthur Tedder then handed to the Russians a map showing the per-centage of air cover (taking that provided over the United Kingdom as 100 percent.) which could be provided over certain areas in Northern France.Considerable discussion ensued on the possibility of an operation againstthe Cherbourg Peninsula, including the capture of the Channel Islands.MARSHAL VORONOV and MARSHAL SHAPOSHNIKOV said thatthe Channel Islands could be used for fighters to cover the main operations on the peninsula. They quoted the examples of Malta and Leningrad as showing howaircraft could be operated under the most adverse conditions if the A.A. guns and fighters were established.In reply, it;, was pointed out that only some four squadrons of fighters couldbe operated from the Cherbourg and Channel Islands aerodromes, and that aconsiderable time would be required to ihstal guns, dig shelters for petrol,ammunition. &amp;c, and to make other preparations for using the aerodromes,whereas at Malta and Leningrad it had been possible to do all this work beforethe war began. In this case, the islands would have to be seized first and fightercover would be lacking at the time it was most needed in the early stages of the landing.After considerable discussion on this point, SIR ALAN BROOKE said thatthe British and American staffs had studied the Cherbourg and Channel Islandsoperation in great detail and come to the conclusion that it afforded no chanceof success. They had therefore decided not to carry it out. They did not proposeto alter their views.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV said that he had no wish to force his opinionbeyond a certain point, but he wished to make his views known. Notwithstandingall the arguments we advanced, if two great nations like Great Britain and theUnited States were determined to carry out an operation this year, then it wasinconceivable that they could not succeed.SIR ALAN BROOKE said that he was grateful for these views, which weresimilar to those which had been given full weight in the British investigations.GENERAL MAXWELL referred to the suggestion that the move of theUnited States troops might be accelerated. He said that the first priority for shipping in the United States was given to supplies for Russia. The nextpriority was for the move of troops to the United Kingdom. He was sure thatno opportunity had been missed to speed this up.2. The Situation in the Caucasus.SIR ALAN BROOKE said that he was anxious for the safety of the supplyroute to Russia via the Persian Gulf to the Caucasus; and he had been thinkingwhat could be done to help to cover it. Efforts were being made to build up anarmy in Iraq and Persia and tentative plans had been produced for the movingof air forces to the assistance of the Russians. He was- anxious to know how theRussians regarded the situation, and the possible rate of the German advance,so that our actions might be timed to meet the conditions. There had been sometalk on this point with M. Stalin, and he was hoping that it would be possible toamplify it.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV said that his instructions from his Govern-ment were to discuss the question of the second front and hear the British and american points of view on this. If the Caucasus was of interest, he would haveto get instructions before proceeding to discuss it.GENERAL SIR ARCHIBALD WAVELL said that, as Commander-in-Chief, India, he was obviously concerned in the matter. A German advanceSouthward presented an ultimate threat to India&apos;s Western flank. There were many Indian troops in Iraq and Persia, and he had to consider what reinforce-ments to send. The matter was of vital importance both to us and to the russians in view of the supplies passing through Persia. He hoped that MarshalVoroshilov would get the permission of his Government so that the question couldbe studied jointly. &apos; *SIR ARTHUR TEDDER said that, if Air Force squadrons were to be sentto the assistance of the Russians in the Caucasus, it was essential that we should get together very early to make plans and preparations.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV enquired how long the British representatives would be staying in Moscow.
SIR ALAN BROOKE said that, according to present plans, they were leaving the following morning.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV said that he would consult his Governmentand give a reply by 5 p.m. He agreed that the German advance threatened India,but his opinion was that the best way of holding the Germans on any part of theRussian front would be to open a second front in Europe.SIR ARCHIBALD WAVELL said that Great Britain and the UnitedStates had decided to open a second front in Africa in a manner which seemed tothem to be most profitable. The Caucasus was an area, however, in which direct assistance might be given to the Russians, and this point would repay study.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV repeated that he would give a reply on thispoint by 5 p.m.3. Other Operations.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV said that certain alternative operations hadbeen referred to. He enquired whether the details of these could now be discussed.SIR; ALAN BROOKE said that he was not at liberty to disclose any detailsof these operations, but he could assure Marshal Voroshilov that plans and preparations were going ahead with full vigour.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV then enquired whether any date could be givenfor the opening of a second front in 1943.SIR ALAN BROOKE said that it was too early yet to give any definite date.Preparations had been begun some time ago and were going forward continuously.He could only say that the date would be as early as it would be possible tomake it.Moscoiv, August 15, 1942.Minutes of a Meeting held at Spiridonievka, 17, Moscow, at 6-30 p.m. on saturday, August 15, 1942.Present:General Sir Alan Brooke, Chief of the    Marshal Voroshilov.Imperial General Staff. Marshal Shaposhnikov.General    Sir   Archibald    Wavell,    General Voronov.Commander-in-Chief, India.Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder,Air Officer Commanding-in-chief,Middle East.Major-General Maxwell, U.S. Army.Major-General Bradley, U.S. Army.Secretariat :Colonel E. I. C. Jacob.Colonel Shcherbakov.Interpreters:Major Theakstone.Engineer Captain Tiurin.The Situation in the Caucasus.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV enquired what particular aspect of thesituation in the Caucasus was of primary interest to the British.   -SIR ALAN BROOKE said that the line of supplies to Russia throughPersia was threatened by the German advance. Certain reinforcements werebeing sent to North Persia, and other precautionary measures were being taken,but it would be extremely helpful for us to know what degree of urgency shouldbe attached to these measures, and whether there was any way in which direct assistance to the Russians could be given. Mr. Churchill had tentatively proposed
to M. Stalin that it might be possible in certain circumstances to send someSquadrons of the Royal Air Force to fight with the Russians in the Caucasus.If the move of these Squadrons was to be carried through smoothly and quicklywhen the time came, plans and preparations should start now.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV said that, although the Germans had penetrated some distance South of the Don, the measures which the Russians hadtaken were sufficient to protect the supply route. He had heard for the first timeto-day of the suggestion that air support should be given, and he welcomed theproposal. He felt sure that with the assistance of the R.A.F. the Russians couldnot only stop the German advance, but could finally defeat them on this front.The sooner the squadrons could arrive the better.SIR ALAN BROOKE said that he could not give any definite under-taking as to the number of the squadrons which could be sent or as to the date when they could arrive. Their move was dependent on the outcome of certainoperations which were impending in the Middle East.SIR ARTHUR TEDDER said that the important point was to get all the preparations made in advance of the move of the squadrons. The kind of preparations he had in mind were the allocation of aerodromes, the preparationof additional landing grounds, the provision of accommodation and communica-tions, the building up of stocks of material, the provision of petrol and oil, andthe method of co-operation between the Russian and British Air Forces and theRed Army. All these matters should be settled, and the work entailed should becarried out in advance.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV said he quite understood the value of making these preparations in advance, but the first question was would the help be forthcoming? War was an uncertain matter, and, supposing the operations inthe Middle East went unsuccessfully, would the aircraft then be withheld ?Would it not be possible for the British to make an unconditional offer?SIR&apos;ALAN BROOKE said that the promise which the Prime minister had made was conditional on success in the impending operations. Even so, itwas, he thought, a generous offer which the British would do their, utmost to fulfil as spon as the Air Forces could be liberated. He was not in a position tomake an unconditional offer. In the meanwhile, we were completely in the darkas to the Russian strength and dispositions in the Caucasus. We had been quitefrank in our statements to the Russians and so far we had had no response. Hewould be very glad to hear from Marshal Voroshilov his views on the generalsituation in the Caucasus.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV said that the Russians had 25 divisions on theCaucasus front with corresponding air and tank support.. He could not giveaccurate details of the latter as the situation changed so quickly, in the fightingwhich was going on. He had no exact data as to the enemy&apos;s strength, but hethought that, including the formations which were turning East towardsStalingrad, the Germans had about one and a half times as many divisions asthe Russians. The various routes through the Caucasus mountains were fortifiedand held. Positions had been prepared to guard against a landing at Batum,and the coastal road to Baku was also well held. He was confident that Balm andthe Caucasus mountains would be held&apos; until the winter. The central route through the -mountains would become impassable in October, and it was easilydefensible.SIR ALAN BROOKE enquired whether any assistance could be given to theRussians in the form of engineers or explosives.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV said that they had plenty of engineers, but theywould be glad to receive help with explosives.. Above all, they would value airassistance.SIR ARTHUR TEDDER said that, preparations for receiving squadronshad so far not been possible North of Tehran. He was most anxious to proceed assoon as possible with preparations further North.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV said that he had no objections to discussionsbeing started, but it would be necessary to know the exact number of aircraftthat would be provided and whether they would have to be manned by Russianaviators. &apos; &quot;SIR ARTHUR TEDDER said that if a force were sent it would be acomplete and balanced force on the proportion of 8 fighter squadrons to 3 light
bomber and 2 medium bomber squadrons. There would also be a reconnaissance squadron and probably some heavy bombers.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV enquired the number of squadrons for whichpractical plans should be made. The amount of work to be done would obviouslyvary greatly if there were a thousand aircraft or a hundred aircraft. In theformer case much would require to be done in the way of construction of landing grounds and accommodation. In the latter case it was probable that most of thefacilities would be available.SIR ALAN BROOKE said that he could not do more than make the tentativeoffer which had already been made : we would send the maximum that could bemade available in the approximate proportion which Sir Arthur Tedder had mentioned. The primary object was to set up the machinery whereby plans and preparations could be made so that, as soon as a decision was given, work could proceed. The Prime Minister would be in a position shortly to make an authoritative statement.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV said that the position appeared to be veryindefinite, and it hardly seemed worth while preparing aerodromes on chance.SIR ARTHUR TEDDER pointed out that it would be better to haveaerodromes and no aircraft rather than to have aircraft with no aerodromes onwhich to put them. It was to avoid the latter contingency that we were anxiousto get to work at once.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV said that he did not doubt the sincerity of theoffer, but it should be realised that the Russians were engaged in very seriousbattles and decisions had constantly to be taken. It would be very helpful, there-fore, to have something definite on which reliance could be placed. Nevertheless,he was quite prepared for discussions to start straight away.SIR ALAN BROOKE said that he was very glad to hear this, and enquiredwhere would be the best place for the air officers who would work out the detains to come.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV said that it would be best to start work in moscow and then proceed to the scene of operations. It would be realised that theproposals now being made would have to be sanctioned by M. Stalin andMr. Churchill.SIR ALAN BROOKE said that he quite understood this.GENERAL MAXWELL said that he would like General Bradley to be associated with the discussions, as it was possible that the Americans would alsobe providing air assistance.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV welcomed this proposal.SIR ALAN BROOKE thanked Marshal Voroshilov for the information that he had provided, and assured him that the British would do their very best to come to the Russians&apos; assistance as soon as possible. They quite realised theRussian situation, and the very best intention lay behind the proposals now putforward.MARSHAL VOROSHILOV said that he was grateful for the co-operationoffered and especially for the promise of help in the air. This would be particu-larly welcome if it came in time and in sufficient strength. The meetings whichhad taken place would inspire renewed energy into the efforts to defeat thecommon enemy.August 16, 1942.
