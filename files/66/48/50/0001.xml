SECRET. Copy. No.W.P. (44) 200.13th April, 1944.WAR CABINET.Printed for the War Cabinet.  April 1944.COMMERCIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.THE Washington proposals as they stand are incompatible with a sound and permanent agricultural policy.2.   The attached paper shows -(i) that the principle of the Wheat Act (even if the Washington proposals were modified to permit it) would not of itself provide a satisfactory basis;(ii) what are in brief the minimum additional measures required;(iii) the compatibility of these measures with reasonable prices to theconsumer.3. The Annexes &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; to the paper set out the arguments more fully.R. S. H.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, S.W. 1,13th April, 1944.POST-WAR AGRICULTURAL POLICY IN RELATION TO THEWASHINGTON PROPOSALS.A Government food policy should maintain reasonably stable conditions of&quot; cheap food &quot; to the consumer.2. The consumer gets no lasting benefit from wide fluctuations in the priceof food. They merely disturb wages, employment and industrial conditionsgenerally.3. There is no question of keeping prices at an artificially high level. all we need is the maintenance of food prices at normal average world levels, thusironing out short-term fluctuations.4. Could the problem be solved by a general applicatipn of the levy subsidyprinciple of the Wheat Act 15.   The difficulty is that there are fundamental differences between(i) perishable foods such as meat, vegetables, butter, and(ii) non-perishable foods such as wheat;and between(i) foods of which we import a high proportion of our needs such as butter and wheat, and(ii) where we import only half or a small proportion of our requirements,such as meat;and between(i) foods where the demand is inelastic, such as wheat, and[27265]&apos; b
(ii) foods where it is elastic and where demand can easily switch to analternative, e.g., from butter to margarine, or beef to mutton or porkor bacon;and between(i) food products where the United Kingdom takes a moderate proportionof world exports, e.g., wheat, and(ii) where we are virtually the sole market, e.g., we take 86 per cent, of world exports of beef80      ,, ,, -        ,,        butter95      ,, ,, ,,        bacon98      ,, ,, ,,        mutton and finally between(i) crops which are sown annually, and(ii) tree crops or livestock which take years to mature. This makes a singleremedy practically impossible.6.   The levy subsidy principle worked well in the case of wheat because- (i) imports represented 75 per cent, of supply;(ii) world wheat prices could fluctuate over wide limits before there was anycase for a substantial change in the price of the loaf;(iii) there is no acceptable alternative to the loaf.7. There is hardly any other foodstuff to which it could by itself be success-fully applied.Cheeese is a possibility.Butter: a levy-subsidy would be feasible, but consumers would turn tomargarine and latter could not be brought within scheme.Meat: a levy might have to be substantial and would be reflected in higher retail price. The ease of consumers switching from one form of meat to another would make maintenance of price parity between say mutton,beef, pork and bacon essential.Oats and certain other animal feeding-stuffs: a levy subsidy would be quite impracticable.   This would particularly affect Scotland.8. A possible alternative would be a &quot; global &quot; scheme for a uniform levy on imports of all agricultural products to provide subsidies for home agriculture.This involves the collection of a levy on imports of commodities on which nosubsidy is required as the price level is satisfactory. This means an unnecessaryburden on the consumer. It would in effect be a tariff, with proceeds earmarked for the assistance of home producers.9.   The conclusion is :The principle of the Wheat Act by itself would not afford a basis for a sound long-term agricultural policy.10. Minimum and Practical Scheme. (A levy subsidy for wheat and anyother suitable commodity: for most other stable commodities fix price based onfair average world price. Then regulate imports to extent necessary to main-tain that price. Home farmers to get any additional assistance over and above this price by direct Exchequer subsidies.Advantages. (No artificial scarcity or dear food. Stability. Cost of exchequer subsidies can be estimated in advance and related to pre-determinedquantum of home production.This can be done either under a system of private trade or/by import boards.11. The combination of these two methods provides stable conditions forproducer and consumer alike. The consumer would not pay appreciably more forhis food, over a reasonable period, than he would under conditions of unregulatedsupply and wildly fluctuating prices which render a stable agricultural policyimpossible
3 .245&quot;ANNEX &quot;A.&quot;Post-War Agricultural Policy. ;;Levy Subsidies.It has been suggested that acceptance of the principle of the levy subsidy would be sufficient to provide means for securing a satisfactory post-war policy for British agriculture.2. The system of the levy subsidy operates by the collection of a levy tocreate a fund out of which a subsidy is paid on home production. The operation is self-balancing, the rate of the levy varying from time to time so that the fund is just sufficient to bring the producers return up to a prescribed standard figure.The levy falls on the consumer and it is highest when he is best able to bear theburden, i.e., when the market price is lowest and the margin to be bridged bysubsidy to the home producer is greatest.3.   The outstanding case of a levy subsidy before the war was in respect /of wheat.   A standard price was fixed related to a standard -qna^ty- of home-^^^^^^produced wheat, and the amount of the levy varied to the extent required to pay /the standard price in respect of a standard -qwa^y. If the world price of wheat/^^^j^^^^i.fell the levy automatically pro tanto increased.4. Under the Washington proposals the amount of any levy could notexceed X per cent, of the world price, so that if the world price fell the levywould fall and the farmer would only be sure of Y per cent, above the world price, whatever the world price might be (Y being whatever percentage the proceeds of the levy would provide when spread over the volume of home produc-tion). The farmer would, therefore, have no certainty on embarking on productionof a particular commodity what price he was goinp; to get for it when it came tobe sold.5.   The levy subsidy is only applicable to a limited number of commodities.It worked well with wheat because (a) imports represented 75 per cent, of total supply; so that a small levy on imports provided considerable subsidy for home production;(b) world wheat prices could fluctuate over wide limits before there was acase for changing the price of a loaf;(c) there is no alternative similar food to the loaf.6. There are hardly any other commodities to which this system by itselfcould be successfully applied. (In some cases it would be feasible in conjunctionwith regulation of imports.)Meat., Imports (taking beef, mutton, lamb, bacon and pork together)are little more than half of total supplies. With no regulation of imports to prevent market prices from collapsing the levy might have to be substantial,and would, of course, be reflected in retail price. Experience has shown that changes in the comparative prices of different meats and of meats and fishor eggs cause a quick and substantial switch in consumers&apos; demand. parity of retail prices would, therefore have to be maintained.Butter (imports 95 per cent, of consumption) and Cheese (imports80 per cent, of consumption) -Levy subsidy would be feasible, but butterconsumers would turn to margarine when it suited them, and it would bedifficult to bring margarine within a levy subsidy scheme.Eggs (imports 50 per cent) Similar considerations to those which arise in the case of meat would prevent a levy subsidy working without undueburden on the consumer, unless there was also some regulation of imports.Oats and certain other Animal Feeding-stuffs-A. levy subsidy wouldbe quite inapplicable. Imports are only a small fraction of total suppliesof various forms of animal feediflg-stuffs, many of them interchangeable.This would particularly affect Scotland.7.   It has been suggested that an alternative to separate schemes for differentcommodities would be. a &quot;global &quot; scheme for a uniform levy on imports of allagricultural products to provide the subsidies that may be required from time[27265] b 2
ANNEX &quot; B.&quot;Post-War Agricultural Policy.Minimum Requirements.1. What is the minimum required under any general economic or com-mercial policy to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to fulfil its undertaking toprovide a satisfactory post-war policy for agriculture, assuming &quot;no policy-of artificial dearness or scarcity of basic foods.&quot;2. It is generally agreed that there must be a greater measure of economic stability than existed in the inter-war period, and that British farmers will haveto be given, at any rate in respect of some staple foods, something more thannormal world prices. It is necessary, however, to be clear about the real natureof the problem.3. It was pointed out in the Washington discussions that in the inter-war period world prices of staple foods had been subject to the most violent fluctua-tion, amounting often to no less than 70 per cent, within one year. Everyone wasagreed that steps should be taken to secure a greater measure of price stability.4. The consumer gets in the long run no advantage from such fluctuations;the wage-earner&apos;s concern is a stable cost of living. In the presence of fluctua-tions in world prices such as occurred pre-war it would not be practicable to rely on direct Exchequer subsidies alone to maintain reasonable and stable prices forBritish farmers. With fluctuations of this order of magnitude low tariffs arevalueless or harmful. They are futile as a means of maintaining prices in the domestic market and yet they may impose an unnecessary burden on the consumerwhen world prices are at their peak.5. At the Washington discussions the main remedy proposed for this violentinstability in world prices of food was the Buffer Stocks Scheme. It is, to say the least, doubtful whether this Scheme would prove practicable in the case ofany of the staple foods; and, secondly, its authors admit that it could not beapplied in the case of perishable foods, viz., beef, mutton, bacon, pork, eggs,dairy products, fruit, &amp;e, which are the commodities with which british agriculture is mainly concerned.6. As an alternative, the Washington proposals provide that where theBuffer Stocks Scheme proves unsuitable, there can be an international scheme forthe regulation of production, exports and imports. This is equally valueless.Since such schemes are only to be introduced where Buffer Stocks Schemes fail,they would come into operation, if at all, too late to save the situation.  Further,to time for different classes of home production. This, however, would involvethe collection of a levy on imports of commodities, in respect of which the price level was satisfactory to home producers, and no subsidy was required by them.It would therefore often impose an unnecessary burden on the consumer. Itwould be a substantial departure from the self-balancing levy subsidy system as generally understood and would in effect be a tariff, the proceeds of which areearmarked for the assistance of home producers as may be found necessary.8. It should be noted that if we had a State Import Monopoly in thiscountry engaged in the bulk purchase of the staple foods it would be possible for it though this is, of course, precluded under the Washington proposals toapply in effect both the principle of quantitative regulation of imports designedto keep prices stable and the principle of the levy-subsidy as a means of providingstable and satisfactory prices for home agricultural production. A State ImportMonopoly, if it is to be effective, implies in practice quantitative control ofimports. (The Washington proposals provided for a State Monopoly, but anineffective one.) If quantitative control of imports is conceded to a State Mono-poly 3ft$r should we be precluded from applying it in a Private EnterpriseEconomy ?
it must be remembered that we are not only the largest importer of food butvirtually the only importer of the perishable foods mentioned above.86 per cent, of world exports of beef are sent to this country.98 per cent, of world exports of mutton are sent to this country.95 per cent, of world exports of bacon are sent to this country.80 per cent, of world exports of butter are sent to this country.52 per cent, of world exports of cheese are sent to this country.48 per cent, of world exports of eggs are sent to this country.In these circumstances it would obviously be dangerous for this country, whetherfrom the point of view of its producers or consumers, if regulation of productionand marketing of these products had to be subject to international agreement and carried out under an international scheme.7. The conclusion is, I think, clear. The Washington proposals provide no effective remedy for the violent fluctuations in world prices of food which werethe main cause of the depression of agriculture in this and other countries in theinter-war period.8. If the British Government is to ensure satisfactory economic conditions for domestic agriculture, it must first of all have the power in its own hands tomaintain reasonably stable prices for food in this country. It is not necessarythat the prices should be above normal average world levels; but they must bestable prices. If this is done, the amount of the financial assistance to be givento domestic agriculture becomes a manageable and practicable proposition, and adecision as to the methods by which the assistance is to be given and the extent towhich it is to be borne by the Exchequer or the consumer or shared between bothremains within the power of the Government to decide.9. There are, moreover, fundamental differences in the problems that arise as between perishable foods like meat, butter, eggs and vegetables and non-perishable products like cereals; or as betweeen foods-where differences in price according to quality or seasonal factors are not important (e.g., wheat) andthose where they are (e.g., meat, fruit, vegetables, eggs); or as between foods ofwhich we import a high proportion of our requirements or only half our require-ments or only a small proportion of our requirements; or as between foods wherethe demand is inelastic (e.g., bread), and those where it is elastic and where it ispossible to switch to an alternative food (e.g., from butter to margarine or frombeef to bacon); or as between foods the supplies of which are controlled by state or statutory Export Monopoly Agencies in overseas countries, and those thesupplies of which are still largely a matter of dealings between private exportingand importing agencies; or as between crops which are sown annually and treecrops or livestock, the production of which cannot be quickly increased ordecreased; or as between food products where the United Kingdom takes a moderate share of world exports or, as in the case of beef, mutton, pork, bacon,butter, &amp;c, where we are virtually the sole world market taking in from80 per cent, to over 90 per cent, of world exports.10. There are, in my opinion, two practicable ways in which the government can maintain reasonably stable conditions of &quot; cheap food,&quot; and at the same timegive such financial &quot;assistance to domestic producers as is necessary to maintain a reasonably prosperous and well-balanced agriculture.(i) In the case of some commodities it is practicable to apply the principleof the levy subsidy embodied in the Wheat Act of 1932. Theadvantage of this system where it can be applied is that it imposes no appreciable burden on the consumer (the Wheat Act evokes no serious criticism) and involves no charge on the Exchequer. &apos;(ii) In the case of other staple commodities, the only practicable method is toregulate the amount of imports coming on to the market at any given time to the extent necessary to maintain a reasonably stable price basedon a normal fair average world price, and then to give any assistance that may be required for the home farmers over and above this priceby way of direct Exchequer subsidies. Under this system the amountof. Exchequer subsidies can be estimated in advance and controlled and related to a predetermined quantum of home production.&apos; this regulation of the amount of imports designed to maintain stable pricescan be carried out either under a system of private trade as was done before the war or under Import Boards. The Washington proposalsrule out both.
11. There are certain special agricultural commodities like early luxuryvegetables and fruit which can be more conveniently dealt with by high seasonaltariffs though these too are prohibited under the Washington proposals.12. My conclusion is the principle of the levy subsidy can only be effectively applied in the case of certain commodities. As regards the majorityof the staple food products, the Government cannot provide a satisfactory policy for agriculture without the power to regulate by some means or other the quantityof imports. Direct Exchequer subsidies without power to regulate imports wouldinvolve an unlimited and uncontrollable contingent commitment for the Exchequerwhich no Government could accept.
