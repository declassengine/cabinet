(M) 162.lQth March, 1944.WAR CABINET.SCHEME FOR RE-ALLOCATION OF MAN-POWER AFTER THE ENDOF HOSTILITIES  IN EUROPE.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service covering draft White Paper.AT the meeting of the War Cabinet on the 3rd March (W,M. (44) 27th Con-clusions, Minute 3) it-was considered that an early Government statement shouldbe made on the scheme set out in W.P. (44) 71. I attach herewith a draft white paper which has been prepared on the assumption that the statement must bemade in public session and that an explanatory document must be published at thetime of the statement.2. I understand, however, that the Service Ministers entertain doubts as tothe advisability of any statement being made at the present time, as it is feared that it will distract attention from &apos;&apos; Overlord &apos;&apos; and will give rise to a certainamount of discussion and speculation, which, on the eve of impending operations,it would be wiser to avoid. There is the further point that we are not yet in aposition to say what inducements, in the way of improved pay, will be given tothose who are retained in the Forces after a European Armistice, and the FirstLord of the Admiralty has stressed this as an additional reason for deferring any statement on the re-allocation plan. The Cabinet will wish to give carefulconsideration to these arguments, but my view is that an announcement can nolonger be withheld. Speculations are going on in the Press which must be veryunsettling to the men and women in the Services, and I believe that.a statement on re-allocation will be likely to have a thoroughly good effect at the present time.3. If a Government statement is to be made in the near future, the timing and publicity arrangements are of the utmost importance and they raise questionsof policy which require Cabinet decision. In my view, the White Paper should bemade available in the Vote Office immediately after the Government statement and the debate should proceed forthwith. As my colleagues are aware, the Houseof Commons have recently reacted strongly against important statements beingmade without the opportunity of immediate debate. They have also been apt to object to the alternative course of making Government policy known through thePress before the House has been informed, and this is inevitable if a White paper is published before the statement is made. There are other obvious objections tohaving the scheme, as set out in the&quot; White Paper, publicly canvassed before thefull Government statement is made.4. There is one further point. I gave an undertaking to consult the joint consultative Committee on the Governments plans before they took final shape.I have not done so because I was afraid, as a result of recent experience, that therewas a risk that secrecy would not be observed. This would cause serious trouble inParliament and would lead to garbled versions appearing in the Press. What Ihave arranged, therefore, is to have a meeting of the Joint Consultative Committeenext Monday, the 20th March, in order to give them an opportunity of placingbefore me any views or proposals they may have.[27113] b
Ministry of Labour, S.W. 1,lQth March, 1944.5. The draft of the White Paper has been agreed with the Service Depart-ments and the Treasury. It is not intended to do more than indicate theGovernment&apos;s plan in broad outline, and there are a number of points, some of whichwere mentioned in the Cabinet discussion on the 17th February, still to be settled.As a result, however, of further consultation with the Chancellor of. the exchequer on the question of financial treatment, it has been agreed that eight weeks should stand as the period of paid furlough for Class A, but that the period of the transfergrant for Class B should be reduced from four weeks to three. Other outstandingmatters, which need not hold up the general announcement, will be taken up onthe Interdepartmental Committee which, in accordance with the conclusions ofthe Cabinet, is in process of being established.E.

69draft government white paper. ;;re-allqcatiqn   of  man-power   during  anyinterim   period   between   the   end   of,   hostilities in europe and the defeat q$japan. i]:ly;:&apos;&apos;-&apos;&apos;;;: p;,-; Pli-        ; ]&apos;    Introduction.  &apos;\ &quot;        -\..:.&apos;.!  .      &apos;The &apos; Governments plans are based on the principle that, the war against,the Axis powers is one war and that it will not end until their total defeatthroughout the world. The plan set out in this paper is framed on theassumption that hostilities will first end in Europe, and it relates solely to the interim period between the end of hostilities in Europe and the defeat of japan. It is governed by the paramount consideration that there can be nobreak in the war effort after a European armistice and that in association withthe other Allied powers at war with Japan there must be the maximumdeployment of the forces needed to bring complete and final. victory at theearliest possible moment.2. It follows that no general demobilisation either of the Armed forces or of war industry can take place in the interim period. The problem during that period will not be one of demobilisation but of re-allocation of man-power between the Forces and industry in order best to provide for therequirements of the changed situation.3. As an essential part of this re-allocation, it will be necessary to continuethe compulsory recruitment of men for the Forces in order to bring relief tothe men who have served for long periods and enable more of them to returnto their homes. It will also be necessary to maintain the requisite control overindustry and labour during the interim period in which there will continueto be heavy and overriding demands for munitions of war and other essentialproduction.4. Until the requirements for the continuation of the war against japan and for the garrisoning of occupied countries are definitely known, it isimpossible to determine the level at which the Armed Forces will have to bemaintained in the interim period. The - Government anticipate, however, that,taking the Armed Forces as a whole, re-allocation between them and industryinay be possible on a substantial scale, although it is clear that the rate of re-allocation must differ as between the three Services. . Re-allocation mustbe governed&apos; by two main principles:  ...(a) military requirements must override all other considerations, and(b) the arrangements for the release of men from the Forces must be suchas will be readily understood and accepted as fair by the Forces andmust not be too complicated for practical application.Release or Transfer from the Forces.5. The Government adhere to the view that a fair and reasonable scheme can best be secured on the basis of release according to length of service andage, but they recognise that it will also be necessary to make a limitedprovision for certain urgent work of reconstruction on which a beginning mustbe made in the interim period. This will be mainly for tjie purpose of building and providing homes for the returning sailors, soldiers and airmen, and for providing for the better education of their children. The plan accordinglyprovides for two separate methods of selecting men for return from the Forces.Those selected according to length of service and age will form one class(Class A), and those selected on account of their qualifications for urgentreconstruction work will form a second class (Class B); these classes areseparately dealt with below. It must be clearly understood that no man willbe released or transferred from the Forces if his retention is considered neces-sary on military grounds, though the Services will make every effort to releasemen in their turn in whatever tJieatre of war they may be serving..6. Men due for release or transfer from the Forces will be given anopportunity to volunteer for a further period of service.Class A7. The number of releases in Class A will correspond to the reduction inthe strength of the Forces and will be increased in consequence of the calling up of further new recruits. Men will be released by release groupsbased on a combination of length of war seryice and age. In general, war service means whole-time service in the Armed Forces&apos; since the3rd September, 1939, which counts for Service pay. Owing, however, to military considerations, release will necessarily proceed at different rates inthe different Services. Itj will be necessary in some Services to deal separatelywith the several branches and possibly with trades and ranks (or ratings) inthose branches.[27113]b 2
8. Releases of men in Class A will begin as soon as practicable after the defeat of Germany, but there will necessarily have to be a pause duringwhich the Services can identify the men who are to be released first and arrange for the return to this country of those who are overseas.9. The exact weight to be given to age, i.e., how many years of age areto be regarded as equivalent to how many months of service, will-be settlednearer the time of operation, as it must depend largely upon the length of thepresent phase of the war. If the scheme had to operate to-day the Govern-ment would propose that two months of service should count as one year ofage, so that for example a man af 22 years of age with four years&apos; service would be in the same release group as a man of 40 years of age with oneyear&apos;s service. All men above 50 years of age will be treated as a priorityclass to be released, if they so desire, before other men.Class B.10. The men in Class B will be those identified as belonging to particularoccupational classes specified by the Minister of Labour and National service as required for certain urgent reconstruction employments. They will be specially transferred from the Forces to industry for those employments.This class will also include a limited number of individual specialists for whose transfer application may be made through Government departments in accordance with existing arrangements.11. The number of transfers in Class B will be small in proportion tothe number of releases in Class A and transfers in Class B will not beginuntil a start has been made with releases in Class A. In order that thetransfers in Class B should not affect the number of releases in Class A,additional numbers of young men at present deferred, particularly in the munitions industries, will be called up to the Forces. The actual numbers for transfer in Class B will be determined from time to time in the light of:  (i) the immediate requirements for the reconstruction employments;and(ii) the extent to which those requirements will be met by releases in class A and by transfer from munitions and other work at home.12. The selection of the required number of men from a particularoccupational class for transfer in Class B will be based on the principle oflength of war service and age.Distinctions in the Treatment of Class A and Class B.13. It is.essential to the scheme that there should be a clearly markeddifference in the treatment of the men released in Class A in their turn, andof the men transferred in Class B out of their turn. Accordingly the termsapplying to the two classes will be sharply differentiated as follows:  Class A.(1) They will be placed to a special class of Reserve, from which theywould be recalled only in an extreme emergency.(2) On release they will be given eight weeks&apos; furlough with full pay,ration allowance and family allowance, dependants allowance, and war service grants where these are then in issue. Payment willbe made by an advance on the day of release, the remainder being paid at regular intervals. These payments will be given to assist in resettlement. In addition to the period of eight weeks, men whoare qualified will be given a further period of regular payments inrespect of foreign service. The precise method of assessingpayments in respect of foreign service will have to be determinednearer the date of operation. Owing to the different practices asregards leave between the three Services the rules may notnecessarily be the same for each Service. All these payments willbe made for the full period, irrespective of whether the recipientsare in employment or not.In addition to the regular service payments given to assist inresettlement, it is intended that [some form of]* war gratuityshould be issued by way of reward for service. The amountscannot yet be settled and a date on which they will be madeavailable must also remain for decision later. It is intended thatthey shall be placed to the accounts of the recipients in the PostOffice Savings Bank.f These payments are additional to anddistinct from the Service post-war credits which are alreadyaccruing from the 1st January, 1942.(3) On release, those who have had at least six months&apos; service will begiven civilian clothes in addition to the Service clothes which theywill be allowed to retain (see Appendix).(4) They will be permitted to exercise their reinstatement rights and go back to their old jobs.   If they have no jobs to which to return,* The Minister of Labour and National Service has written to the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer suggesting that the words in brackets should be omitted.f The Minister of Labour and National Service is in correspondence with thePostmaster-General about this sentence.
70the Employment Exchanges will give them every assistance in finding employment and will not during the period in which theyare receiving regular Service payments regard them as subject toany powers of direction which are otherwise generally operative.Olass B.(1) They will be placed to Reserve, from which they will be recalledindividually to the Forces if they discontinue their reconstruction-&quot;.%   employment.(2)&apos; On being passed to Reserve they will be -given a &quot;transfer grant &quot;of three weeks&apos; full pay, ration allowance and family allowance,dependants allowance and war service grants where these arethen in issue.   Post-war credits and any other payments due onaccount of war service and foreign service will be held in suspenseuntil^the end of the war.(3) On being passed to Reserve those who have had at least six months&apos;service will be given civilian clothes in&apos;addition to the Service&quot;clothes, which they will be allowed to retain (see Appendix).(4) They will be directed to their reconstruction employments, and thiswill preserve their reinstatement rights to the end of the war.(5) Men selected for transfer in Class B will not be transferred against their wish, but it will be open to them, if they so desire, to awaittheir normal turn for release in Class A. Once, however, a man. has been transferred in Class B, he will not subsequently be eligible to apply for inclusion in Class A.Compassionate Releases.14. It will be possible for men to obtain release on compassionate grounds in accordance with the arrangements already in force. Post-warcredits and any credits due on account of war service and foreign service will normally be held in suspense until after the end of the war, but in suitable cases the same treatment may be given in these respects as will be accorded to Class A.Pensions.15. Men released or transferred who wish to claim pension for disable-ment due to war service may apply to the Ministry of Pensionsimmediately on release or transfer, and if they do so any pension found tobe due will take effect from the date of cessation oif service pay and allowances.Women.16. The arrangements for release and transfer from the forces described in this paper will also apply to women, with the addition that marriedwomen and women above 35 years of age will be treated as priority classes.The financial arrangements will be on the same lines as for men. Civilianclothing will not be provided, but a cash grant and clothing coupons willbe given instead.   Certain articles of Service clothing will be retained.APPENDIX.Clothing to be given to Men on Release ok Transfer from the Forces.The following civilian outfit will be supplied:  1 suit (non-austerity).1 shirt.2 collars.1 tie.2 pairs socks.1 hat or cap.1 raincoat.1 pair shoes.The following items of Service clothing will be retained: -1 part-worn battledress or jacket and trousers.1 pair of serviceable part-worn ankle boots or shoes.1 jersey pullover.2 shirts.4 collars.1 tie..2 sets of underclothing.2 pairs socks.,&apos; 2 towels.1&apos; V&apos; : --&apos;] - 1j        1 pair knitted gloves. : &apos;1 pair braces.Kit bag.Cleaning and toilet articles.1 housewife.1 cap badge and titles.Identity discs.Women will he given a cash grant in lieu of civilian clothing and will be allowedto retain certain articles of.
