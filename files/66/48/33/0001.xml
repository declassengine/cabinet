(44) 1834th April, 1944.WAR CABINETSHIPPING OF RELIEF SUPPLIES FOR PRISONERS OF WAR and civilian INTERNEES IN THE FAR east memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. I circulate for the consideration of the War Cabinet a memorandum relating toa scheme for the shipping of supplies for prisoners of war and internees in the handsof the Japanese, which has been prepared by the War Office with the agreement ofthe various Departments concerned.2. The essential points of the scheme are:  (a) A request that a ship carrying supplies with a neutral crew, operated by theInternational Red Cross Committee, should be allowed to proceed to a port designated by the Japanese on the perimeter of the area under Japanesecontrol.(&amp;) An offer to provide a separate ship to be handed over to the Japanese and tobe used by them for the collection of the supplies from the designated port and their further distribution to the various places where prisoners of warand internees are held in the Far East.3. There is a desperate need for these supplies for the relief of those detained inthe Far East. All previous efforts on the part of the Commonwealth and United states government or the respective Red Cross Societies to get them to the prisoners have failed, with the exception of the comparatively small amounts occasionally carried byexchange ships.4. On the other hand I feel that the scheme now to be put to the JapaneseGovernment implies a too facile acceptance of their refusal to comply with the customsof civilised nations and that the bribe contained in the offer of a ship is humiliatingto the Governments of this country and of the Dominions.5. For these reasons I feel that the War Cabinet will desire to say whether they wish the scheme to be presented to the Japanese Government.The War Office,MEMORANDUM ON THE SHIPPING OF RELIEF SUPPLIES FOR PRISONERSOF WAR AND CIVILIAN INTERNEES IN THE FAR EAST1. The Japanese Government have not accepted any proposal for a regular service for the conveyance and distribution of relief supplies to prisoners of war and civilian internees in the Far East, whether made to them through Government or Red Crosschannels either of the British Commonwealth or the United States of America. Thelast specific proposal was that made in the Spring of 1943 by the American Red Crossto sail a ship to a port designated by the Japanese, there to be handed over to a Japanesecrew and to be used for the distribution of relief supplies to the ports in Japanesecontrol, after which the ship was to return to the original port and be handed back toits original crew. This proposal was rejected, but the Japanese indicated that theywould agree, in principle, to receive supplies via Vladivostok. Arrangements were accordingly made for supplies to be carried by Russian ships from the United states to Vladivostok and they have been stored there for some time in readiness for trans-mission, but no means for their on-carriage have yet been accepted or proposed bythe Japanese; and they have recently refused to consider the matter further until they receive satisfaction regarding certain alleged bombings of hospital ships andimproper treatment of Japanese interned in the United States.4th April, 1944.P.

2. In an attempt to re-open the matter the American Red Cross has now suggested to the International Red Cross Committee, for negotiation with the Japanese, a proposalnot dissimilar to that made by them last year. On this occasion the International Red 1Cross Committee are asked to sponsor a scheme through Red Cross channels wherebytwo neutral ships should sail to a designated port with supplies, and there be handedover to Japanese crews, to be used for delivery of the supplies to the various areas whereprisoners are held, after which they should return to the designated port, be handedback to their neutral crews and return to neutral or United Nations territory for further supplies. The State Department at Washington has also submitted to the Soviet Govern-ment, with a view in due course to approaching the Japanese Government, a proposalfor regular exchanges of civilians and sick and wounded prisoners via Vladivostok,the exchange ships to carry relief supplies; and the Soviet Government are understood to have agreed in principle tp the use of Vladivostok. The State Department andthe American Red Cross are aware of the proposal developed below and have indicated that they see no reason why it should not be pursued simultaneously with any american proposals.3. With the concurrence of the Admiralty, the Air Ministry and the Ministries ofEconomic Warfare and of War Transport, and with the support of the Foreign Office,the Colonial Office and the India Office, a scheme has been devised as follows:  (a) one freight steamer manned by a neutral crew and operating under the auspices of the International Red Cross Committee should be allowed to proceedwith relief supplies to a port designated by the Japanese Government on the perimeter of the area under their control;(6) the supplies should be unloaded at that port for trans-shipment to a secondship to be provided b3^ the U.K. Government and handed over to theJapanese and manned as they choose, this second ship to be used by themexclusively for the distribution and collection of relief supplies for prisonersof war and civilian internees;(c) these ships should be used reciprocally if desired for the collection and despatchof relief supplies for Japanese subjects in the hands of the United Nations.4. It is proposed to put the scheme to the Japanese Government on the basis thatcertain foodstuffs and medicines necessary for the health and welfare of the prisonersof war and internees in Japanese hand are not available in the territories subject to japanese control. Arguments or phrases likely to provoke refusal will be avoided andthe case will be presented in a way which can be accepted by the Japanese authoritieswithout loss of face. At the same time, the offer of a ship will relieve the Japanese ofany pretence that we were imposing a burden on their shipping; and in making thatship available to be used only within waters which they regard as under their control,an attempt is made to meet the known Japanese suspicion on security grounds of anynon-Japanese crew sailing in and out of waters and ports they regard as under their control.5. The present proposal (except in so far as it involves handing a ship overcompletely to the Japanese) follows closely lines which were agreed by the DominionGovernments some 12 months ago. There is every reason to think.that it will beaccepted by them.cb44/      )   wo   4/44   W.O.P.   17281
