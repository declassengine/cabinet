REPORT BY BRIGADIER MACLEAN ON THE PRESENT MILITARYAND POLITICAL SITUATION IN YUGOSLAVIA, MARCH 1944.Dear Prime Minister, Drvar, 18th March, 1944.I enclose the original of Tito:s letters to you of the 28th January and the9th February,* already transmitted by signal.As I reported at the time, Tito was obviously delighted to hear from you,and your personal correspondence with him has greatly strengthened our positionhere. The Partisans also took Randolphs arrival here as a great complimentand as an indication of the interest which you take in them.I have had a number of talks to Tito about King Peter and I think that youwill agree that he has on the whole not responded badly to your messages onthis subject. It has, of course, made all the difference to him to hear from youpersonally that there is a chance of the King&apos;s breaking with Mihailovic and theGovernment. This has all along been the chief obstacle to any understanding between them, and I hope that it may now be possible on the basis of the proposals put forward in the course of your correspondence to reach an agreement whichwill be to the benefit of all concerned. Tito, who has come on a lot since hisearly days as a Communist agent, realises, I think, the importance for his move-ment of reconciling all sections of the population and also of establishing good relations with Great Britain and the United States.The Soviet Mission arrived by glider with a large supply of vodka andcaviare, now unfortunately exhausted. General Korneev and his numerous staff are very friendly and easy to get on with and we are on excellent terms with them.Randolph has thrown himself with great energy into his task of remedyingthe Partisans&apos; phenomenal ignorance of the Allied war effort. I hope that before long he will be able to make his way to some of the more outlying formations.I enclose a copy of a note I have written on the situation here, in case you have time to read it.Yours sincerely,FITZROY MACLEAN.Note on the Present Military and Political Situation in Yugoslavia.1. During recent months there have been certain developments in themilitary and political situation here which I think are worth recording.2. The Partisans have of late gained greatly in self-confidence. Theyclearly now feel that the future of their movement is assured.3. Militarily, much has occurred to strengthen their hand. The collapse ofItaly last Autumn relieved them of one of their enemies, filled their arsenals, andgreatly improved their strategical position. Simultaneously the capture by theAllies of bases in Southern Italy greatly increased the opportunities of supplying the Partisans and of affording them air support. Thousands of new recruits,whom they were now able to equip, joined the ranks of the Army of national liberation, which now numbers 292,000, as compared with 200,000 six months ago. Against them stand 14 Reichswehr Divisions, together with an approxi-mately equal number of Bulgar and Quisling troops. Of these, 7 ReichswehrDivisions are used to hold the coastal area, where-an Allied landing is clearlyanticipated, while the remaining German forces are used to keep open the mainlines of communication, and, particularly, the Belgrade-Zagreb Railway. Thereis some evidence that the Germans are planning, in the event of a strong Alliedlanding, to withdraw to a northern defence line between the Drava and the Savarunning down to the coast at Fiume. There is, however, no evidence that they intend to adopt this course in other circumstances or in any case unless forcedto. On the other hand, there is little in the way of decisive action which theycan at present undertake against the Partisans. The recent sixth offensive, alarge-scale attempt by the Germans to restore their position and regain the* For translations, see Appendix.[27166a] b
initiative, failed in its object and only enabled the Partisans to capture furtherquantities of arms and equipment. It seems unlikely that any future german offensive will prove much more successful, for, by undertaking any large-scaledeployment of their forces, they expose themselves to Partisan raids andambushes, while in the face of any frontal attack the Partisans withdraw intothe woods and mountains, only to reappear in force elsewhere. OverwhelmingAllied air superiority has now practically put an end to enemy air activity in yugoslavia, while Allied aircraft constantly harass the Germans and theirassociates, who thus find one of their most deadly weapons against the Partisansturned against them. Meanwhile Allied successes in other theatres of war have encouraged the Partisans and demoralised their opponents. To the Partisansvictory and freedom thus at last seem within reach.4. Politically, the outlook for the Partisans is no less encouraging. Duringthe past six months they have been accorded an ever-increasing degree of recognition by the Allies. Mr. Eden, in his speech of the 14th December, publiclyrecognised them as an Allied force. The Press and broadcasting systems ofGreat Britain and America, which six months ago neglected them almost completely in favour of Mihailovic, now never let a day pass without someflattering reference to them. Great Britain, the Soviet Union and the UnitedStates now all have representatives at Marshal Tito&apos;s headquarters. WithMr. Churchill&apos;s letter of the 8th January, Tito entered, into direct correspondence with the head of an Allied Government. Tito was frankly delighted at this and neither he nor his advisers attempted to disguise the importance which they attached to it. Finally, the Prime Ministers speech of the 22nd February wasgreeted by the Partisans with unqualified enthusiasm as &apos;1 the first authoritativestatement of the Yugoslav problem to be given by one of the Allied Leaders &quot;and Tito described it to me as having made history for Yugoslavia. This speechhas established our relations with the Partisans on a firm basis, for it has given them an unequivocal assurance that both their efforts and their problems areappreciated by us and that we would in no circumstances attempt to force upon them a solution of the latter contrary to their wishes. Further, coming after the moscow and Teheran conferences it has made clear to them the closeness of the collaboration which exists between Great Britain, the United States and theSoviet Union.   In its light they look forward to the future with confidence.5. This new confidence, both military and political, has manifested itself in a variety of ways. The Partisans have displayed an increased sense of theirown importance but also an increased sense of responsibility.6. While realising that in present conditions success for his forces stilllies in strict adherence to the fundamental principles of guerrilla warfare, Titoalready looks forward to the time when the Army of National Liberation willbe able to assume the characteristics of a modern army. Hence his requests for tanks and heavy artillery and the importance he attaches to the trainingof pilots to form the nucleus of an air force. Hence, too, the emphasis now laid on formalities. At the same time the Partisans gladly accept their responsi-bilities as an Allied Army. Tito is willing to co-ordinate his plans with oursand so to direct and time his attacks on the enemy as to bring the maximum benefit to the common cause.7. In the political sphere this greater sense of security has been reflected in an increased emphasis on the outward forms of State and in a desire todeal on equal terms with other Governments. In November 1943 the AntifascistCouncil (AVNOY), until then the only central and civil authority, decreed, as supreme legislative body, the formation of a Provisional Government or national committee. At the same time it invested this Provisional Government withsole authority to represent the Yugoslav nation and formally deprived the RoyalYugoslav Government in Cairo of all rights in this respect. Various other measures were passed by AVNOY on this occasion, including one giving Titothe rank of Marshal and another forbidding the return of King Peter to yugoslavia until the Yugoslav people were able to choose freely whatever formof government they wished. It may be observed that the Provisional Govern-ment which Tito now formed was carefully chosen to include representatives ofall the nationalities of Yugoslavia and of all shades of political opinion. ever since, the Partisan propaganda machine has continued to emphasise the significance of the Provisional Government and of the other measures passed at the same time, until they have come to be regarded as an integral and fundamental part of the movement of National Liberation.8. This new found pride of office has not made the Partisans any easier todeal with.   They are quick to take offence and to suspect the Allies of seeking to
patronise them or to interfere in their affairs. But, like other revolutionaries, onceestablished in office, they have soon found that it takes more than ideologicaluplift to govern a country, and it is only fair to say that they have lost no time infacing their responsibilities. Reconstruction and rehabilitation are urgentproblems, and the Partisans cannot but realise that their country is bound to depend on Great Britain and America, not only for material support during thewar, but for relief and the means of prosperity after the war.9. Above all, they have worked hard to found a united and independentYugoslavia. The common struggle for national liberation has forged strongerbonds of union between the Serbs, the Croats and the Slovenes, the Catholics, theOrthodox and the Moslems who took part in it than ever existed in pre-warYugoslavia. Nor can the Partisans be accused of intransigence or intoleranceIn their efforts to unite the people of Yugoslavia they have shown themselves ready for reconciliation and collaboration with all save their bitterest military andpolitical opponents, and by this means they are rallying ever larger sections of thepopulation to their cause.10. In an earlier report I said that in many respects Yugoslavia under the partisans already resembled a part of the Soviet JJnion, and that whether shebecame an independent democratic State or a, second Outer Mongolia would depend largely on the attitude adopted by Great Britain and the United States at thepresent state of her development.11. In the meantime much has occurred. British and American support ofthe Partisans has greatly increased, while we have withdrawn completely our support from Mihailovic. Our contact with the Partisans has become much closer,and there can be no doubt that they have realised the advantages of maintaininggood relations with other Great Powers beside the Soviet Union. Moreover,with the establishment of national institutions and the machinery of a nationalState, the international and doctrinaire Communist features of the movementhave undergone certain modifications. It is, after all, only natural that, in such circumstances, even Communists should lose some of their taste for inter-nationalism, and my own impression is that Tito himself has progressed a longway since his early days as an agent of the Comintern, though some of his sub-ordinates have clearly not moved as far or as fast. Indications of such progressare not hard to find. In particular, Marshal Tito has, in his reception of the newly arrived Soviet Mission, gone out of his way to emphasise that their statushere is to be exactly the same as that of my Mission, and General Korneev and his staff have shown themselves equally scrupulous in&apos; this respect and ready for close collaboration with the British and American representatives here. Tito&apos;s policyin the matter is well summed up in the following extract from an article in thenew official publication &quot;Nova Yugoslavia &quot;: &quot; Our attitude is the same towards all our Allies .... We do notdisguise the fact that our relations with the Soviet Union are strengthened by common racial origin and by historical tradition, but this only means thatthey have reached a degree of cordiality which should exist between allAllies.&quot;In general, Partisan propaganda has of late emphasised the support whichthe Army of National Liberation is now receiving from Great Britain and america and the friendly relations which are growing up out of this.12. If the foregoing appreciation is correct, there should be nothing in the yugoslav situation which need be contrary to British interests, which call for theestablishment of a strong, independent and democratic Yugoslavia, maintainingfriendly relations with her neighbours, but not allowing herself to fall under the exclusive domination of any one Power. Nor need we fear any conflict between our purely military interests, which clearly demand wholehearted materialsupport of the Partisans, and our political interests, which likewise can onlybenefit by such support.FITZROY MACLEAN, Brigadier,Commanding Anglo-American Mission to the yugoslav Army of National Liberation.mh March, 1944.[27166a]b 2
APPENDIX.Translations of the Full Texts of Marshal Tito&apos;s Letters to thePrime Minister of 28th January and 9th February, 1944.*(Translation.)Your Excellency,Your message brought by Brigadier-General Maclean, is a valuable proof that our people have, in their superhuman struggle for freedom and independence,a true friend and ally at their side, who deeply comprehends our needs and ouraspirations.For me personally, your message is an honour, for it expresses your highacknowledgment of our struggle and the efforts of our National LiberationArmy.I thank you heartily for your photograph from the Tehran Conference with your dedication.Your Excellency, be sure that we will endeavour to keep your friendship,won in the most difficult hours of our people&apos;s history and which is extremelydear to us. Our devastated country and our people, exhausted with suffering,need and will need in future the help of our great Allies, not only during thewar, but also in peace, to enable us to heal the terrible wounds inflicted on us by the ignoble Fascist invader.It is our wish to fulfil to the utmost our duty as Ally in the common military effort against our common enemy.The aid tendered to us by our Allies very much contributes to ease our situation on the battlefield. We also hope, with your help, to obtain heavyarmament (tanks and aircraft) which, in the present phase of the war and owingto the present strength of our National Liberation Army, is indispensable to us.I quite understand your engagements towards King Peter II and hisGovernment and I will contrive, as far as the interests of our peoples permit,to avoid unnecessary polemics, and not cause inconvenience to our Allies in thismatter. I assure you, however, your Excellency, that the internal politicalsituation created in this arduous struggle for liberation, is not only the resultof the strivings of individuals or some political group, but it is the irresistibledesire of all patriots, of all those who are fighting and those who support thisstruggle, and these are the enormous majority of the peoples of Yugoslavia.Therefore, the people have set us difficult tasks, and we are bound to accomplishthem.At the present moment all our efforts turn to one direction, and that is:(1) to assemble all patriotic and honourable elements so as to render our struggle against the invader as efficient as possible; (2) to create true union and brother-hood of Yugoslav nations which did not exist before this war, and the absenceof which caused catastrophe in our country; (3) to create conditions for theestablishment of a State in which all nations of Yugoslavia would feel happy,and that is a truly democratic, federative Yugoslavia.I am convinced that you understand us, and that we will have your valuablesupport in these strivings of our peoples.Yours very sincerely,(Signed) TITO,Marshal of Yugoslavia.28th January, 1944.His Excellency,Winston Churchill,Prime Minister of Great Britain.*Note : Telegraphed summaries of these letters were circulated in W.P. (44) 100 andW.P. (44) 155 respectively.
(Translation.)To the Right Honourable Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of Great Britain.Your Excellency,Owing to the importance of your message of the 5th February and the message of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,-1 was obliged to consult themembers of the National Committee of Liberation of Yugoslavia and the membersof the Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia on the points raised in those messages.Analysis of these points led to the following conclusions : &apos;1. The Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia, as you know, confirmed at their second session on the 29th November, 1943, that theyfirmly stand for the union of the Yugoslav nations. However, as long as thereare two Governments, one in Yugoslavia and the other in Cairo, there can be nocomplete union. Therefore, the Government in Cairo must be suppressed andwith them Draza Mihailovic. That Government must account to Government ofA.C.N.L.Y. for having squandered enormous sums of the nation&apos;s money.2. National Committee of Liberation of Yugoslavia should be acknow-ledged by the Allies as the only Government of Yugoslavia, and King Peter IIwould have to submit to the laws of the A.C.N.L.Y.If King Peter II accepts all these conditions, A.C.N.L. will not refuseco-operation with him, on condition that the question of monarchy in Yugoslaviabe decided after the liberation of Yugoslavia by the free will of the people.King Peter II should issue a declaration to the effect that he has only theinterests of his fatherland at heart, which he wishes to be free and organised asthe peoples themselves decide after the war is over, by their own free will, anduntil then he will do all in his power to support the arduous struggle of the peoples of Yugoslavia.These conclusions were reached in consideration of the following facts : A special arrangement with King Peter II during the war would have the opposite effect to that which your Excellency and His Majesty&apos;s government desire. We believe that a certain number of neutral and hesitant elements,especially in Serbia, would join us, but such- a measure on our part would provoke among patriots of all parts of Yugoslavia who have been fighting threeyears, serious anxiety and suspicion, especially in Croatia, Slovenia andMacedonia. This would, on the one hand, shake the morale of our army, while,on the other hand, the Germans, Ustoshas and others would make use of it intheir propaganda against us and make it impossible for us to mobilise new forces against the invader in these areas.We are convinced that the solution of this matter according to our proposal, which, we consider, does not differ in principle from yours, would havethe most favourable effect not only on our struggle for national liberation, butalso on the interests of the Allies and of the King himself, who would in thisway be delivered in the eyes of the people of all further responsibility for themisdeeds which various traitors are committing in his name.I hope, your Excellency, that the reasons I have given may help you to exertinfluence on far-reaching decisions made in this matter, which will extremelyindebt the nation of Yugoslavia to His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Yours sincerely,^ (Signed) J. BROZ-TITO,President of National Committee of liberation, Yugoslavia.9th February, 1944.
