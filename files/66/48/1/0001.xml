I am alsosending you a brief memorandum of my conversation with him at the time Ipresented the note.Yours sincerely,(Signed) DAVID GRAY.(No. 410.) Legation of the United States of A merica,Excellency, Dublin, 21st February, 1944.Your Excellency will recall that in your speech at Cork, delivered on the14th December, 1941, you expressed sentiments of special friendship for theAmerican people oh the occasion of their entry into the present war, and closedby saying &apos;&apos; The policy of the State remains unchanged. We can only be a friendlyneutral.&quot; As ybu will also recall, extracts of this speech were transmitted to thePresident by your Minister at Washington. The President, while conveying hisappreciation for this expression of friendship, stated his confidence that the IrishGovernment and the Irish people, whose freedom is at stake no less than oars,would know how to meet their responsibilities in this situation.It has become increasingly apparent that, despite the declared desire of theIrish Government that its neutrality should not operate in favour of either of the belligerents, it has in fact operated, and continues to operate, in favour of the axis Powers and against the United Nations, on whom your pccr.vity and the[27063]
maintenance of your national economy depend.    One of the gravest and mostinequitable results of this situation is the opportunity for highly organisedespionage which the geographical position of Ireland affords the Axis and deniesthe United Nations.   Situated as you are in close proximity to Britain, dividedonly by an intangible boundary from Northern Ireland, where are situatedimportant American bases with continuous traffic to and from both countries,Axis agents enjoy almost unrestricted opportunity for bringing military informa-tion of vital importance from Great Britain and Northern Ireland into Irelandand from there transmitting it by various routes and methods to Germany.   no opportunity corresponding to this is open to the United Nations, for the Axishas no military dispositions which may be observed from Ireland.   We do notquestion the good faith of the Irish Government in its efforts to suppress Axisespionage.   Whether or to what extent it has succeeded in preventing acts ofespionage against American shipping and American forces in Great Britain andNorthern  Ireland  is,  of  course,   impossible   to   determine  with   certainty.Nevertheless, it is a fact that German and Japanese diplomatic and consular representatives still continue to reside in Dublin and enjoy the special privileges and immunities customarily accorded to such officials.   That Axis representatives in neutral countries use these special privileges and immunities as a cloak forespionage activities against the United Nations has been demonstrated over andover again.   It would be naive to assume that Axis agencies have not exploitedconditions to the full in Ireland as they have in other countries.   It is our understanding that the German Legation in Dublin, until recently at least, hashad in its possession a radio sending set.   This is evidence of the intention ofthe German Government to use this means of communication.    Supportingevidence is furnished by the two parachutists equipped with radio sending setsrecently dropped on your territory by German planes.As you know from common report, United Nation military operations are in preparation in both Britain and Northern Ireland. It is vital that information from which may be deduced their nature and direction should not reach the enemy.Not only the success of the operations but the lives of thousands of United Nationsoldiers are at stake. We request, therefore, that the Irish Government take appropriate steps for the recall of German and Japanese representatives inIreland. We should be lacking in candour if we did not state our hope that this action will take the form of severance of all diplomatic relations between Irelandand these two countries. You will, of course, readily understand the compellingreasons why we ask, as an absolute minimum, the removal of these Axisrepresentatives, whose presence in Ireland must inevitably be regarded as constituting a danger to the lives of American soldiers and to the success of allied military operations.It is hardly necessary to point out that time is of extreme importance andthat we trust your Excellency will favour us with your reply at your earlyconvenience.Accept, Excellencv, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.DAVID GEAY.Memorandum of Conversation with Mr. de Valera on the 21st February, 1944.At 3.30 p.m. on the 21st February, 1944, Mr. de Valera received me at my request. After a brief reference on my part to His Eminence CardinalMacRory&apos;s Lenten Pastoral I informed the Prime Minister that I had been instructed by my Government to present the Note which I now delivered to him.I said that I would be glad to answer any questions which he might see fit to put to me.He then read the Note and at a certain point paused and said, &quot; Is this an ultimatum?&quot; I replied that to the best of my knowledge and belief it was inno sense an ultimatum, nor did the text contain any &apos;&apos; or else &apos;&apos; clause. He thenfinished the Note and said in substance, &quot; We have done all we could do to prevent )espionage directed against your interests and we can do and will do no more.As long as I am here my answer to this request must be no.&quot; I said that Iregretted this view of our request; that it seemed to us a reasonable one and that,with due regard for the security of American lives and for the success of our military operations, we could hardly do less than make it.The Prime Minister was at all times extremely courteous.I then thanked him for having received me and took my leave.D.

36ANNEX II.Note presented by Sir John Maffey to Mr. de Valera on the 22nd February.The Government of the United States recently consulted His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom on their proposal to address to the Govern-ment of Eire a request for the removal of Axis diplomatic and consular representatives in Eire. It was with the full concurrence of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that the United States Government made this approach to theGovernment of Eire in their note of the 21st February, 1944. &apos; The UnitedKingdom Government desire to make it clear to the Government of Eire that, fortheir part, they warmly welcome the initiative which has been taken by the UnitedStates Government, and that they fully support the request for the removal from eire of German and Japanese diplomatic and consular representatives.The United Kingdom Government wish to emphasise the importance whichthey attach to this request.ANNEX III.Letter from Mr. Gray to Mr. de Valera dated the 2nd March.Dear Mr. Prime Minister, Dublin, 2nd March, 1944.Mr. Walshe telephoned me this morning and told me that you would appreciate a confirmation of the oral assurances which I had been instructedto give you and which I did give you during our interview on the 29th February,1944.You will recall that I informed you that I had received a telegram from my Government which stated that the Irish Minister in Washington, Mr. RobertBrennan, had called upon an officer of the State Department, Mr. John Hickerson.Mr. Brennan told Mr. Hickerson that, in his view, the note in question of theAmerican Government appeared to him to be an ultimatum; that in his view a refusal of the request would result in invasion of Eire by the United States,that he was very troubled about it and that he had been informed that hisGovernment in Dublin took a grave view of the matter. The Secretary of Statethereupon instructed me by telegram to allay the apprehensions of the IrishGovernment and give you oral assurances in the sense set forth in the telegramitself. I then told you that in order that there might be no variation between my instructions and the assurances I was about to give you I would read you the paraphrase of that portion of the telegram which set forth the nature ofthe assurances.The substance of this was the statement of Mr. Hickerson to Mr. Brennanthat the .request was not by way of being an ultimatum and that he,Mr. Hickerson, was certain that no use of military force was contemplatedagainst your country; furthermore, the assurances which the President had given to you in the early part of 1942 still stood as then. These assuranceswere embodied in a note to the Irish Minister in Washington on the 26thFebruary, 1942, for you as Prime Minister of Eire on the occasion of american forces landing in Northern Ireland. The words then used by the Presidentwere : &quot; There is not now, nor was there then, the first thought or intention ofinvading the territory of Ireland or of threatening the security of the Irish&quot;I think you will agree that this assurance of the President amply warrantedmy reply when, on the occasion of my presenting the note to you on the21st February, 1944, you asked me, &quot; Is this an ultimatum1? &quot; and I answered,&quot; To the best of my knowledge and belief it is not an ultimatum nor does the text contain any &apos; or else &apos; clause.&quot;That portion of the telegram which I read to you relating to what mr. Hickerson told Mr. Brennan as being likely to happen in the case that you were unable to accede to our request and in the case that, by reason of military information reaching the Axis Powers through the medium of Axis espionagein Eire, the lives of American soldiers should be imperilled or lost, I read toyou not by instruction but on my own responsibility and on the assumptionthat Mr. Hickerson&apos;s observations were in process of being transmitted to youby your Minister in Washington.
You will recall that when you expressed yourself as seeing a sinisterimplication in these observations, which you said had become part of the record,.I at once stated that it in no sense had become part of the record as betweenyou and me and that I regarded it as conveying a friendly warning toMr. Brennan of what was likely to happen in the case any terrible catastropheoccurred to American soldiers and sailors as a result of information which couldbe traced as reaching the Axis from Eire. As I explained to you in this regard,,it was obvious that if American lives were lost in this way American mothers,and the American press would most probably conduct just such a campaign of publicity against Eire as you and I would least desire. You will recall thatyou then told me that neither you nor any one else could guarantee against sucha possibility; that you had from the beginning done the best you could and thatyou would continue to do so. I then told you that as our note set forth were recognised the entire good faith of the Irish Government in its efforts to preventAxis espionage. I might also have said that I entertained a high regard forthe ability, energy and high character of your Minister for Justice, who is primarily charged with preventing espionage. But since no one can give aguarantee in the existing circumstances, I pointed out to you that if you are unwilling to accede to our request, we could only regard you as assuming a moralresponsibility for the consequences in the event of some tragic happening of thenature suggested.You will recall that I said that we hoped as earnestly as you did that nothing of the sort would happen, and that we would continue to co-operate with you tothe end that nothing might happen. You will recall also that I said that wecontemplated no retaliatory action in the event that you formally refused our request, as you had intimated would be the case, and that it seemed to usunwarranted that you should read into our request, in our view a reasonable one,the menace of a conspiracy to force you into the war by the exertion of various forms of pressure. I then cited our policy of supply towards Eire since thebeginning of the war, mentioning the important fuel reserves of turf now storedin Phoenix Park brought there- by American gasoline of which the american people were being deprived. 1 asked you also if it were reasonable to believe thatwe were preparing to make war on you when I was in process of obtaining for theIrish Sugar Company the strategic metals in short supply in America which youassured me last spring were necessary for the manufacture of next year&apos;s crop of beet.The only other matter of importance that I can recall taking up with youwas my statement that our Secretary of Legation, Mr. Aaron Brown, had been told, as coming from some one who had obtained the information from you, thesubstantially true account of the three various notes which the American, British,and Canadian Governments have recently delivered to you. I then told you thatif this story broke, it would not come from this Legation.In my view, it is not important to my Government whether the story is published or not, but I am sure that my Government does not wish in any way to embarrass you or to increase the tension between our respective countries and peoples and, to the best of my information and belief, the Secretary of Stateentertains no present intenion of making the notes public.Trusting that this will cover, the assurances in question and the generalbackground of the episode, I am,Yours respectfully,DAVID GRAY.
