THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  March 1944.Copy No.WAR CABINET.RE ALLOCATION OF MAN-POWER.Memorandum by the Chancellor or the Exchequer.1. The draft White Paper by the Minister of Labour and National Seryice*refers in paragraph 13 to the war gratuity, of unspecified amount, which is tobe granted on or after demobilisation. An announcement in the terms proposedwithout further qualification will no doubt give rise to an expectation that thewar gratuity, when decided upon, will be available for all demobilised menirrespective of the Service to which they have belonged. This involves animportant point of principle on which it appears desirable that a decision shouldbe reached before any announcement is made.2. At the end of the last war the Navy were granted prize money. Prizebounty, referred to in paragraph 5 below, was also granted in the last war. TheNavy subsequently became eligible also for the war gratuities which were approved for issue to the Army. Though the grant of prize money appears to have been restricted to men qualified by certain periods of sea service, the resulting grants to men so qualified were in general at least equal to, and in the case of the moresenior officers substantially in excess of, the average amount of war gratuityearned by Army personnel. Broadly speaking, therefore, a substantial part ofthe Navy received double the reward earned by their counterparts in the Army.I cannot regard such a result as equitable, and it was not so regarded by the army at the time. It would be unfortunate, in my view, if this situation were now.tobe repeated.3. This question was brought before the War Cabinet in March 1940. Itwas decided (W.M. (40) 80th Conclusions, minute 8) that no immediate announce-ment should be made as to the grant of prize money and prize bounty to officersand men of the Naval forces, and that the decision in regard to such grants should, if possible, be deferred for consideration at the end of the war inconnection with the consideration of gratuities in respect of war service generally.The subsequent course of the war has reinforced the grounds on which my predecessor raised objection (W.P. (G) (40) 91) to the suggestion that the navy should receive the double benefit. At that time, as pointed out by the First Lordin his memorandum (W.P. (Gr) (40) 85), the main burden of the first six months&apos;&quot;fighting had fallen upon the Navy. It cannot now be said that the iVrmy andR.A.F. are not taking their full share in active operations. The R.A.F., or atleast such R.A.F. units as have taken any part in the war at sea, may claimto be entitled to share in any distribution of prize money which may be approved.4. Grants to the Army from the proceeds of booty were discontinued afterthe Ashanti war of 1874 in favour of the issue of a war gratuity. The proper course,- in my view, would be to recognise that the grant of prize money to anyof the Services has, under the conditions of modern war, become anomalous. Itmay, however, be felt in view of the course followed in the last war, that the Navy,in the absence of any announcement to the contrary, have an expectation to prizemoney which it would be difficult to disappoint. If that feeling is strongly held,notwithstanding that no action has been taken in this war to declare any intentionof granting prize money, I should not object to the continuance of the issue ofprize money on this occasion on the understanding that an early opportunitywill be taken after the war to declare it to be obsolete. The First Lord in 1940expressed himself as content Avith such a position so far as future wars are* Circulated as Annex to W.P. (44) 162.[27153]SECRET.W.P. (44) 172.27^ March, 1944.
concerned. It seems to me clear, however, that in that case the Navy ought not toreceive war gratuity in full in addition to the proceeds of prize, but that theyshould be set off one against the other. I must, however, point out that it wouldinvolve the setting up of complicated and expensive machinery, probably requiringlegislation, merely to ascertain the amount payable to the Prize Fund if one wereto be approved.5. The question of prize bounty referred to in the memoranda previouslybefore the War Cabinet, is of smaller financial significance. If in relation to any war the intention is declared by Proclamation or Order in Council to grant thisbounty, the officers and crew of any of His Majesty&apos;s ships present at the taking ordestroying of an armed enemy ship, shall have a bounty at the rate of  5 for eachperson on board the enemy ship at the commencement of the engagement. Itappears to me difficult to justify the continuance of such an arrangement. Itwould appear to operate unfairly in that officers and men bearing the brunt of the routine work may never have the chance of earning the bounty, while the comparatively small crew of, say, a submarine, may by chance secure a hugewindfall. Moreover, in connection particularly with the destruction of enemy submarines, it will frequently be difficult to be certain that destruction has been effected and the number of enemy crew on board will also be a matter of guesswork.In addition, a number of these submarines will really have been destroyed byreason of the collaboration of the Air Force, and it is doubtful whether a grantcan be made in favour of aircraft.J.
