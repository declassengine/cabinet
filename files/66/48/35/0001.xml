The bomb tonnagedropped (3,249 tons) was the largest yet delivered against a single target. Dayphotographs taken on the following day covered only part of the city, theremainder being obscured by clouds and smoke from many large fires still burning,but it was evident that very heavy damage had been caused. This was confirmed by photographs taken in the course of the subsequent United States daylight attack, which also show large fires in and around the main railway station.Further photographs taken on the 25th March show extremely heavy damagethroughout and almost complete devastation of the old moated city which lies inthe centre of the town just north of the river. There are many large areasdevastated by fire, also north of the river. The suburb of Offenbach has been almost entirely destroyed.Berlin (24th/25th March).Reports from all sources as well as the disposition and reactions of theGerman defences make it obvious that Berlin, in spite of the damage done to itas an industrial/and administrative centre, - is still the most important singleobjective in Germany.  First reports indicated that substantial fires were started[27194]&apos;&apos;
in several parts of the city by this very heavy attack, and this was confirmed bythe German communique. Photographs taken on the 25th March show that mostof the city was covered by cloud, so that no complete assessment of the damage caused can yet be made. Through a gap in the clouds, however, fifty fires are seen to be still burning in an area of about one square mile West of Tempelhofand South of Tiergarten.Targets in France.Prints Nos. 1 to 3 show damage at Clermont-Ferrand, Bergerac andAngouleme.Results of Previous Raids.Targets in France.Prints Nos. 4 to 6 show damage at Limoges after the attack of the8th/9th February.Prints Nos. 7 and 8 show damage at Chateau Roux and La Ricamarie afterthe attacks of the 10th/11th March.A.
