ul (Let-La. /THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT9018TH MARCH,  1944.WAR    cabinet economic SITUATION IN INDIAReport by the Chiefs of Staffli      We have examined certain telegrams from the Viceroy tothe Secretary of State for India and a minute from theSecretary of State for India to the prime Minister, and,after consultation with the India Office and the Ministry ofWar Transport, we forward the following report.WHEAT REQUIREMENT2.      In his cable of 4th March/ the Viceroy states:-&quot;We should be able to meet military demands forrice and,  if all goes well in Bengal, where theissue is still in the balance,  the rice situation should improve over last year to the extent thatit may prove unnecessary to supply wheat insteadof rice to Bengal, Travencore and.Cochin&quot;.A cable dated 11th March,  1944  , from the Government of IndiaPood Department to the Secretary of State for India states:-&quot;Lack of confidence persists and position in east Bengal is far from satisfactory.      Plow of riceand paddy to markets remains substantially less thannormal.      Producers are holding and prospects oflarge  scale requisitioning is looming closer,&quot;3,      The principal requirement put forward by the Viceroy isfor wheat, and a preliminary review of the 1944 estimatesshows that, in addition to an irreducible Military demand for724,000 tons, deficit areas, particularly large towns, and essential services,  such as railways,  collieries and factoriesrequire 800,000 tons.      The total gross wheat deficiency istherefore of the order of 1,524,000 tons for 1944.MINIMUM BALANCE TO BE IMPORTED4.     Reference to  the figures in the Annex attached to thisreport shows that the deficit required to be made good by imports amounts to 484,000 tons, of which provision has sofar been made for 50,000 tons./   No.  45 9S of 4th March,   1944No.  2725 of 11th March,  1944-1-

5.      Procurement of surplus stores from Indian producersentirely depends on the confidence of the country in theGovernment&apos;s ability to control the situation.      The viceroyhas said that it will be impossible, unless imports of wheator other food grains are forthcoming in adequate quantities,to maintain the confidence necessary to prevent hoarding andinflation.      In such an event procurement of surplus stockswill not be possible, with the result that the deficit requiredto be made vgood by imports will be substantially increased.Moreover, in such an event:-(a) Defence Services could not be supplied.(b) Essential Services such as railways and factories would fail.(c) Production of coal would be seriously affected,(d) Widespread famine would result in deficit areas.6.      In recent telegrams    the Commander-in-Chief, INDIA andSupreme Allied Commander SOUTH EAST ASIA Command have emphasised the importance on strategical grounds of securingINDIA&apos;S wheat position.      A second famine might have aserious effect on the morale of the Indian Army and on thesecurity of INDIA as a whole, while it would undoubtedlyreact on the capacity of the ASSAM Lines of Communication tonourish the air lift to CHINA and operations in BURMA.7.      The provision of wheat for India is therefore amilitary requirement of great strategical importance.      Thiswheat can be made available in Australia, so that the problem is one of shipping,      A possible method by which shipping canbe found to meet this requirement is by making acorresponding reduction in the revised SEXTANT allocation of tonnage for military maintenance programmes,REDUCTION IN MAINTENANCE PROGRAMME8.      Maintenance requirements have therefore been re-examined in the light of developments since the SEXTANT conference.Operational demands and wastage in theatres other than Italyhave not been heavy and changes in the strategical situationhave made it possible to reduce reserve holdings more than had been expected so that maintenance requirements havefallen.      Moreover, the heavy demands and high priorityaccorded to OVERLORD requirements have imposed restrictionson the amount of material and equipment available for despatch to overseas&apos; commands, while the uncertainties about future&apos;, developments in S.E.A.G, have resulted in a reductionin the anticipated flow of equipment to India,9.     An overall reduction in maintenance programmes generallyis therefore already taking place and in consequence areduction can be made in the SEXTANT allocations for thesecond quarter of the year which., it is estimated, shouldamount to some 8 sailings a month or say 25 ships over the quarter.      If an equivalent allocation were made to carrywheat from Australia to India some.200,000 tons could be imported without interfering with other approved programmes,-t-   58587/CO.S. from General Auchinleck and8HAC0S 95 from Admiral Mountbatten,

iO.        In his telegram2&quot; of 1+th March, the Viceroy states thatthe Commander-in-Chief INDIA and the Supreme Allied CommanderSOUTH EAST ASIA Command have offered to forego 10% of militaryimports into INDIA in order to provide shipping space for wheat..    The Viceroy estimates that this would give INDIA some120,000 tons of wheat in 12 months.THE, VICER0Y&apos;S REQUIREMENTS. ^11.     ^ The release of ships from maintenance programmes shipped from North America and the United Kingdom would not enable theMinistry of War Transport to make available ships to loadimmediately in Australia, and some delay would have to he accepted while  ships were worked into position, during which time detailed arrangements could he worked out for the arrival of the ships in India,,      The Viceroy in his cable4&quot; dated11th March 1944 s has stated that the procuring of the ricecrop at reasonable prices and the preventing of hoarding andprofiteering -&quot;depends on producing confidence in acidity ofGovernment to handle food situation and control prices.Principal weapon, without which we are almost powerless,is visible reserve of foodstuffs- in hand :.of government or at its command from overseas.     Without .this our control cannot be successful and I fear that catastrophewill re suit.&quot;The knowledge that this contribution of 200,000 tonsof wheat would arrive in India during the second and thirdquarters of 1944 should help to keep confidence steady inIndia, hut does not obviate the necessity of making good thebalance of 234.000 tons (See Annex).12.        A proposal has also been made to load small quantitiesof wheat in ships sailing from North America to India,      this could probably be done as deadweight cargo or (bagged)  inbroken stowage without displacing other essential cargo.This would have distinct propaganda value in &quot;India and north america and might enable some further advantage to he taken ofthe Canadian offer of wheat for India,      There are supplydifficulties involved, hut we suggest that the proposal-be approved in principle subject to such difficulties beingsolved.CONCLUSION13.        If 25 ships are released from military maintenanceprogrammes now and reallocated in Australia as soon as possible,we can provide 200,000 tons of wheat towards the deficit of430,000 tons required to he made good by imports.    This is nota complete solution but we cannot make any proposals for thelatter part of the year, since the shipping allocations for thatperiod have not yet been fixed.    The requirement to he metduring the second half of the year would be much reduced if theU.S. Military authorities found that they were able to makefrom shipping allocated to them a contribution similar in sizeto that outlined above,Hj-.        The India Office are satisfied that the tonnage involvedcan be handled at the ports and that the necessary internaldistribution can take place in connection with the whole problenuxNo. 459S of i+th March, 1944+N0, 52Lj.S of 11th March, 1944-&apos;   &apos; -3-

tEECOMLffiNDATlONS15*     We recommend, that:(a) In view of reduced requirements the allocation of shipping for military maintenance programmes should he reduced by 25 ships during the period april to June and the Ministry of War transport should be invited to make available equivalentcapacity for loading In the second and third quarters of 1944, for the carriage of 200,000 tons&apos;ofwheat to India.(b) The U.S. Military authorities should be approachedwith a view to their making a similarcontribution in shipping.(c) The proposal to ship small quantities of wheat to India in deadweight or in stowage should be approved in principle,  subject to supplydifficulties being solved.(d) The shipping necessary to provide the cereals forthe minimum maintenance requirements in india should be tabulated in future as a military requirements(Signed)    A.F.BROOKEG.
