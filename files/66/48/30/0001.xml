(44) 180.3rd April, 1944.WAR CABINET.THE DISTRIBUTION OF DOCTORS IN 1944.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.AT their Meeting on the 31st March (L.P. (44) 15th Meeting) the lord presidents Committee approved allocations of doctors to the Services for thefirst nine months of 1944 as recommended by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs (L.P. (44) 57). The requirements put forward by the Service ministers and the allocations approved are as follows : A llocationRequirements    for firstfor 1944-     nine months.Royal Navy       ............        452 240Army (including R.AM.C. in India)...      1,350 720India      ............... 376 200RAP.    ...      ...      ......      ... 170 902,348 1,250These allocations are subject to the proviso that Service Departments will accept 200 women and alien doctors as part of the allocation of 1,250, and are subject to review in the autumn. Meanwhile, the allocations are regarded asapplicable to the first nine months of the year, even though it may not prove possible to provide the full numbers in that period.2. The Committee are aware of the difficulties which cuts of this order willimpose upon the Service Departments, who will receive little more than one-halfof the doctors for whom they have asked.Recruitment of 1,250 doctors represents, however, the limit of what can beprovided.   This is for two reasons : (a) The medical facilities available for the civilian population have reached a minimum below which it is not possible to go without serious dangerof a breakdown.(b) The Services need fit men of military age.   Almost the only source ofsupply of these men is the newly-qualified doctors coming from theMedical Schools and Hospitals. It is estimated that about 950 ofthese will become available during 1944, all of whom will go to theServices, and none to the civilian medical services. The balance of thetotal allocation of 1,250 will be made up from volunteers from Ireland,such further small comb-out of civil doctors as is possible and recruit-ment of 200 women and alien doctors,3. At the meeting of the Lord Presidents Committee the Secretary of Statefor War made it clear that, in his opinion, failure to supply the full number of doctors requested by the War Office would, unless forthcoming operations were more immediately successful than we had a right to expect, involve a grave risk of[27196]
a breakdown in the Army Medical Services later in the year. Whilst recognising,for the reasons explained in paragraph 2 above, that the allotment of doctors for recruitment to the Services could not be increased, the Committee felt that allpossible steps to insure against such a breakdown should be taken without delay.They accordingly asked the Service and Health Ministers to make immediatearrangements for the appropriate officers of their Departments to examine thepossibility of devising a scheme, whereby medical personnel in various establish-ments, Service and civilian alike, would be ear-marked for immediate transfer, incase of emergency, to establishments where a breakdown or loss of efficiency wouldhave the most serious consequences. It is not proposed that such a scheme shouldbe put into effect unless and until there arises an immediate danger of a break-down such as would justify exceptional measures. Its preparation in advanceshould, however, ensure that, in the event of such an emergency, it will bepossible to take remedial action with the least possible delay.4. Some months ago the United States War Department undertook to supplyus with equipped and staffed field hospitals with 8,000 beds. In spite of efforts which have been made on the highest official level by the War Office, it now appearsthat there is no hope of this undertaking being fulfilled. The United States have themselves been running into difficulties in the supply of medical man-power.But their situation in this respect is not nearly so serious as ours; and it istherefore for consideration whether a further approach should be made to theUnited States Government on a very high level.C. R. A.Privy Council Office, S.W.1,3rd April, 1944.i///
