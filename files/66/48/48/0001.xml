Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1944./SECRET.W.P. (44) 198.11th April, 1944.Copy No.      *J UWAR CABINET.INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. Discussions on international monetary co-operation after the war havereached a more advanced stage than those on commercial policy, commodities and.cartels. Numerous conferences have been held and agreement between the officials of our Treasury and the United States Treasury on a Statement of Principles isnot far off, though there are still one or two important points outstanding. TheUnited States Treasury are now impatient to take the next steps and within thelast few days I have received a very insistent personal message fromMr. Morgenthau. In my judgment, it is therefore now a matter of urgent necessity that we should reach conclusions about our general attitude towards this Scheme.2. I have personally come to the conclusion, on balance, that the international monetary Union would be a valuable instrument for the long-term, that its operation at the right time would not be prejudicial to our own special interests,that the Statement of Principles suitably defines the purposes of the Fund and gives satisfactory guidance for the formulation of the reciprocal obligations ofthe Fund and the members which would be incorporated in an international convention.3. But I think that our willingness to accept it must depend upon the recognition by the American Administration of three conditions : (a) It is primarily designed for the long-term and cannot function satis-factorily unless, for the long-term also, there is in existence someinternational organisation for long-term investment, and unless the short-term problems of reconstruction loans for certain countries whose economy has been gravely damaged by the war have been solved.The International Monetary Fund properly excludes reconstructionfinance from its scope.(b) It should be created not until the end of the war, but so as to come intooperation during the Transitional Period by stages, beginning withthe supervision of exchange adjustments and the arrangements for regular consultation, and proceeding by calling up subscriptions bydegrees, and experimentally, towards the use of the quotas which are,in fact, an instrument for the long-term.(c) We cannot enter the scheme, at any rate with any acceptance of its obligations, until Ave have seen how our difficulties in the transitional period are to be met.4. I must make one further comment on (c) above. Clause 11 of the State-ment of Principles* is designed to free us from the major obligation of thescheme, that is, to convert sterling into any other currency on demand, untilm our judgment we are ready to accept and maintain that obligation. Nor have i forgotten Lord Keynes&apos; letter of the 19th December, 1943, sent with my authorityto Dr.. White (see Annex D to the Summary of discussions with the Dominionofficials).!   At the present stage of the war and of American politics we clearlv* See W.P. (44) 81.[27247]f Appendix to W.P. (44) 192.
see the beginnings of our path through our transitional difficulties in-.VA.7-,; to foreign exchange.   Nor can we, before the election, make too many;-.&apos;;\nu the possibility of assistance from the United States.  But I am of- th.it our difficulties in this regard should, in general terms, be clearlyv;v.     t in the eyes of the Administration.   I propose that we should tellthat while, for the purposes of the Debate in Parliament, we should beat this stage to rely upon Clause 11, we wish them to know confidentially-%* - e secret.-r.ot commit ourselves to adhering to the Scheme unless and until were r s-:&apos;.v. by-v our difficulties in the Transitional Period are to be met.  We should;       same explanation of our position for the confidential information of the&quot;.V.-.vPrime Ministers.3. There is one further question of policy, how far the Monetary Schememm vtwoed separately from the other parts of the Washington Talks. ThehYotoiioii officials confirmed the general view that we have taken in the past, thatvarious parts of Article VII must be considered as a whole. We cannot takes i&apos;. interpretation of that. For example, I think that progress on the.ionai organisation of commodities will necessarily be slow. Soper&amp;aps will anything specific about the regulation of cartels by internationalagresaaeafc. The proposed international agreement on employment policy, which.ii pressed particularly by the Australian representative, on the other hand, is: .-.//..;- declaratory. But the issues on commercial policy are very closely linkedwitli the monetary proposals.Judging from the comments both in Parliament and in the Press when theig Monetary Schemes were published, it is certain that questions will beasked about commercial policy and that the argument will be urged that theOwtnmcj Scheme is a mechanism which cannot work to full advantage unless thesaasmiereial policies which it is intended to serve give it proper opportunity.The talks with the Dominion officials emphasised the relationship betweencommercial policy and the Currency Scheme, particularly during the TransitionalWhile, howver, I think that we must emphasise the close relation betweenEoamierciai policy and the Monetary Scheme, I consider on balance that we should agree to the next steps about the Monetary Scheme without waiting until thediscussions on commercial policy have reached a stage at which they can be f ormu-lated in a corresponding agreed statement of principles. The alternative of long delay would be violently opposed in Washington.6. If my colleagues agree with my view about accepting the Monetary scheme in principle, subject to prior and definite understanding with the american administration on the points above, we have to consider the procedure.As I understand it, the intentions of the United States Treasury are that assoon as the Statement of Principles has been agreed at the official level between us and them, they should show it confidentially to the experts of a few othercountries (Mexico, Cuba, Panama and Haiti), and perhaps that we should showit confidentially to the representatives of the Dutch, Belgian and possibly otherGovernments over here. (The American Treasury have already shown some formof statement to Russia and are in process of showing it to the Chinese represen-tative.) It would then be published in both countries. This would bring it tothe attention of Congress, who would, however, not be required to give it anyendorsement, for, at present, no specific authority is required from Congress.Soon after publication a wider international conference, presumably at a technical level, though Dr. White is rather confused on this point, would be heldin Washington. If the Statement emerges with the general blessing of that conference, I understand that the suggestion is that the President would makethe Scheme an Electoral issue by submitting it as an example of international co--operation which forms part of his general post-war policy. We have noauthoritative information that this is, in fact, the Presidents intention. I fancyhis decision on this point would depend upon the general reaction of members of congress to the Scheme after its publication.7. I do not feel that this procedure is satisfactory. We have so far pro-ceeded on the basis that we and the Americans should agree upon the essentialpoints of these Schemes so that when they come to be considered by other countrieswe may work in general agreement together. I think we must insist upon this.We have to dispose of amendments arising from the talks with the Dominionofficials and some of these are very important. Some have been accepted by the americans, but others not yet.   The Americans have received amendments from
the Russians and we must agree with the United States Treasury about these also.Whether or not the Chinese will propose amendments which are capable of reconciliation with the general shape of the Scheme, I am not yet sure. But I feelcertain that we ought not to embark, at this stage, upon any effort to get agreement on a wider basis before publication.8. My present views on procedure in connection with publication are asfollows : Publication would be upon the basis that the Government would declare its attitude in a Debate to be held at an early date, and that attitude would be asI have described in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.One pre-requisite to publication would be that we should first have cleared the position with the Dominion Prime Ministers. This would seem a necessaryact of courtesy after the recent Dominion talks and the natural course would beto await their arrival early in May. Mr. Morgenthau&apos;s message, however,indicates that if the further conference proposed is to be held before the Election,as is apparently desired by the President, publication must take place within thenext ten days or so. Therefore it will be necessary to resort to the less satisfactory method of telegraphic communication with the Dominions.A second desideratum to which I attach importance is that we shouldmeanwhile have agreed with the Administration in Washington in what termsthey are going to declare their attitude. If we are to declare ourselves on behalfof the Government, we should wish the Americans to do the same and at thesame time. I am not clear what Mr. Morgenthau&apos;s intentions are and havetelegraphed&apos; him to learn them. Until I have received his reply, I am not in aposition to advise my colleagues as to the exact further steps in procedure or asto the status of the further conference which it is proposed to summon in washington shortly.J. A.Treasury Chambers, 11th April, 1944.
