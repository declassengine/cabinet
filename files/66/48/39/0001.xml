this  DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1944.SECRET. Copy No. 36W.P. (44) 189.6th April, 1944.WAR CABINET.LONDON AIRFIELD FOR TRANSPORT PURPOSES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1. In my memorandum W.P. (44) 32 of the 14th January I asked for authority to proceed with Stages 1 and 2 of the Heathrow airport project and fora decision in principle on Stage 3, including sterilisation now of the land whichwould eventually be required for that stage.2. I asked for this authority as an urgent war requirement because of the increasing need for a main terminal airport near London capable of accom-accommodating large types of transport aircraft. Stages 1 and 2 were to fit into an eventual Stage 3, which was to provide a modern post-war civil airport.3. In W.P. (44) 73 of the 3rd February, 1944, the Lord President of theCouncil, as Chairman of the Committee of Ministers to whom my proposal hadbeen remitted, recommended that the Air Ministry be authorised to proceed onStages 1 and 2, provided that the Middlesex Council Sludge Disposal Works couldbe removed from the Heathrow site in time to enable these Stages to be completed by 1946.4. The difficulties arising from this proviso have so far proved insuperable.Search for a satisfactory alternative site has proved unavailing, nor have theMiddlesex County Council been able to give any assurance that the reprovisioningcould be completed within two years. Also I am informed that the acquisitionof a new site may require some form of public enquiry, which would inevitably lead to further delays.5. The need to provide an adequate air transport airfield near London forwar purposes becomes more and more pressing. The consequences of further delay would be most serious.6.   I have therefore re-examined, the problem in order to : (i) achieve. maximum economy in the use of labour during the next fewcritical months;(ii) postpone the necessity for removal of the sludge works.7. The revised plan is shown on the attached sketch. I.propose to constructinitially an East/West runway of 3,000 yards, capable of eventual extension to5,000 yards, and two other runways of 2,000 yards which can be extended later to 3,000 yards. . The alignment of these runways is clear of the sludge works.8. Work this year will be limited to the provision of the 3,000-yard runwayand the minimum of technical and personnel accommodation. The other tworunways will be completed during 1945.9. The latest information from America is that the 250,000-lb. aircraft isnot now likely to be in service before 1947. Accordingly, the extension of themain runway to 5,000 yards can be postponed.10.   The disadvantages of this plan are (i) The alignment of the East / West runway presents constructionaldifficulties, namely, the filling of extensive gravel workings whichwould otherwise have waited till Stage 3 and (for the extension to5,000 yards) carrying the runway on an embankment across theRiver Colne and three streams.[27224]
(ii) The costs of the ultimate scheme will be increased, as the previous planlinked the provision of various drainage and lighting facilitiesdirectly with ultimate requirements. Also, the alignment of one ofthe 2,000-yard runways does not conform with the ultimate plan.As far as can be foreseen costs will be increased by about 4 per cent.11.   On the other hand : (i) Our war needs will be met in time.(ii) Labour requirements will be reduced in the &quot;Overlord&quot; period by asmuch as one-third.12. We have throughout borne in mind that Heathrow will eventually be themain London civil airport. The following are the effects of the new proposal onour preparedness for civil traffic after the war : (a) If the war ends in late 1945 or 1946, we shall have available an airportsuitable for civil aircraft then in operation, and capable of easyextension to accommodate the types that will come in soon afterwards;extension for the 250,000-lb. aircraft will be a matter of civil engineering only. If the war goes on longer, these extensions willhave been completed as military requirements.(b) On the other hand, the provision of a complete modern terminal for london will have been postponed, not achieved, since it cannot becarried out without removing the sludge works.13.   To summarise, I propose : (i) To start at once constructing one runway of 3,000 yards, followed by two runways of 2,000 yards.(ii) When these are completed, to extend the main runway to 5,000 yards and the other two runways to 3,000 yards.These are military requirements, but are. compatible in the main with thefull civil scheme on this site which would, of course, need to be referred to ministers at the time. Meanwhile, the Minister of Town and Country Planningis sterilizing the land required.A.H.M.S.Air Ministry, 6th April, 1944.
