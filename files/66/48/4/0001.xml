Jt[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Cabinet War Room.
NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1.   The weather has again restricted the unloading of supplies at Anzio.&apos;U.S. naval forces have continued to support military operations in theS.W. Pacific.Three U-boats have been sunk, one probably sunk and two possibly sunk.Home Waters and North Atlantic.2. On the night of the 5th/6th, five M.T.Bs. on patrol off the Dutch coasttorpedoed and probably sank a trawler under the fire of shore batteries. On thefollowing night, five M.T.Bs. attacked a large number of enemy ships offIjmuiden and in the course of the action closed to within 500 yards of the harbour-entrance. They probably sank a 2,000-ton ship by torpedo and an auxiliary vesselby gunfire in addition to causing damage to other craft. Two of the M.T.Bs.were damaged : there were six casualties.t3. On the 9th, H.M.S. Asphodel (corvette) while escorting a homeward-bound convoy in the S.W. Approaches was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat.Mediterranean.4. Ait Anzio weather conditions, with a heavy swell and wind rising togale force, have continued to hinder the unloading of supplies. The weathermoderated on the afternoon of the 6th and 5,111 tons were unloaded on thefollowing day, bringing the total for the week ending the 7th to 19,992 tons.The port and anchorage were shelled with varying intensity in the courseof the week and there were several air attacks, but no naval damage or casualties have been reported. The jamming of the shore radar by the enemy is causinginterference with air raid warnings.H.M.S. Mauritius (cruiser) fired 497 rounds during a bombardment of artillery positions and troop concentrations on the 3rd.5. H.M. S/M Universal, on the night of the 26th/27th, torpedoed awestbound tanker off the south coast of France. H.M. S/M Unsparing, while on patrol in the northern ^aegean between the 19th and the 25th, torpedoed a tanker,probably the German s.s. Peter (3,754 tons), and sank four caiques.East Indies.6. H.M. S/M Tally-Ho on the 19th torpedoed a seaplane tender and a cargo ship in the Strait of Malacca, in addition to the ship previously reported.Pacific.New Guinea.7. On the 4th, seven M.T.Bs. shelled Yalau Plantation (east of Bogadjim)preparatory to a landing by U.S. troops. On the night of the 5th/6th, M.T.Bs.destroyed a fuel and an ammunition dump at New Bogia harbour (midwaybetween Wewak and Madang).New Britain.8. On the 1st, light naval forces shelled the Murien area of Arawe prior to.a landing by U.S. troops.Japanese U-boats continue to carry stores and ammunition from Rabaul tothe Solomons and southern New Guinea. There are also indications that enemy destroyers are sailing between Rabaul and the east of New Ireland.Admiralty Islands.9. On the night of the 3rd/4th, Allied destroyers carried out a bombardmentto cover the landing of reinforcements on Los Negros. On the following morning,Allied cruisers and destroyers bombarded coastal batteries in the Islands and enemy concentrations in Seeadler harbour, Los Negros. On the 7th, three destroyers shelled gun positions north of Seeadler harbour.
Solomons.10. On the 2nd/3rd, two U.S. destroyers shelled enemy positions onBougainville. On the 4th, four destroyers gave supporting fire to U.S. ground forces at Empress Augusta Bay, Bougainville. On the 6th, M.T.Bs. sank fourbarges off Nissan Island (N.W. of the Solomons).Anti-Submarine Operations.11. Nineteen attacks have been reported, of which eight were carried outby surface craft, seven by shore-based aircraft and four by carrier-borne aircraft.One of the attacks was made in the Mediterranean.In the S.W. Approaches, the U-boat which had torpedoed H.M.S. Gould,reported last week, was sunk on the 1st by H.M.S. Affleck (frigate) and other ships of an escort group after a hunt lasting 36 hours. On the 6th, ships of a Canadianescort group sank a U-boat after a hunt lasting 30 hours. On the 29th and the1st, U.S. forces possibly damaged three U-boats. In Northern Waters, betweenthe 4th and. the 6th, a Liberator escorting a convoy bound to the U.K. from north Russia sank a U-boat 220 miles west of the Lofoten Islands; air and surface escorts probably sank another and possibly sank a, third. In the Azoresarea a Wellington possibly sank a U-boat on the 2nd off Lisbon.Enemy Intelligence.U-boats.12. The Germans have several 500-ton U-boats which carry 30-40 torpedoesand are primarily intended to supply U-boats operating from distant bases.They can also be used for normal operations.&apos; The construction of pens at Cap Janet, Marseilles, has been abandonedowing to water infiltration. Toulon and Spezia are now the only western mediterranean bases available to U-boats. It is estimated that about 12 are basedon Toulon.In the Indian Ocean four Japanese U-boats are thought to be operating.Two or three German U-boats are probably on passage to Eastern waters.Enemy Attack on Shipping.13. U-boats are reported to have attacked three ships. In Northern Watersa ship in homeward-bound convoy from North Russia was torpedoed south ofBear Island. Off the West African coast one ship was torpedoed in the Bightof Benin, and in the Indian Ocean a ship was torpedoed S.W. of Colombo. a ship was either mined or torpedoed off Tunis : details have not yet been received.Two U.S. ships in an eastbound Mediterranean convoy entered a minefieldoff Tunis; one was sunk and the other damaged.Protection of Seaborne Trade.14. During the week ending the 5th, 886 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations, of which 323 were in ocean convoys and 563 in British coastal convoys. Six escort carriers, 69 destroyers (including 18 U.S. destroyers) and107 sloops, gunboats, frigates and corvettes were employed on escort duties.Three homeward-bound convoys, consisting of 87 ships, and four outward-bound convoys, consisting of 236 ships, arrived at their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying.15. Mines have been laid by ships and aircraft off the Biscay ports and thenorth coast of France.&apos; In the Mediterranean aircraft laid mines in the southern JEgean.Enemy Minelaying, British Mines weeping.16. There have been no reports of minelaying either by aircraft or surface craft.Twelve mines have been destroyed during the week, all off the East CoastThe mine totals are 4,691 ground and 4,196 muored.In the Indian Ocean a dangerous area, due to enemy mines, was declarednorth of Akyab, Burma.[27076] B
MILITARY SITUATION.tThe Russo-German Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern Sector.17. The Russians have continued their advance westwards and have crossed the railway Pskov-Polotsk reaching a point five miles east of Ostrov.Central Sector.18. The German News Agency report of the evacuation of Vitebsk wasevidently premature, and although the Russians have kept up their pressureboth here and north of Rogachev, no change of importance has taken place inthis sector. The Germans still have the use of the railway Vitebsk-Orsha,although the road, five to six miles east of the railway, was cut by the Russiansas long ago as the 31st December, 1943.Shepetovka Sector.19. On the 5th the Russians announced that S.W. of Shepetovka they had broken through on a 112-mile front to a depth&apos;of up to 30 miles. This brought themto within a few miles of the railway Lwow-Odessa, the main supply route forall the German forces in the basin of the River Bug. By the capture of Volochiskthey have now effectively cut this railway. They have also widened the front of their advance by the capture of a number of places S.W. of Berdichev andhave thus reduced the possibility of an effective German counter-attack againstthe newly-formed Russian salient, at any rate from the east.Dnieper Bend.20. , The Germans have reported heavy Russian attacks in the Zvenigorodkaarea, but these have not been mentioned by the Russians.The Rusians have made good progress west and south of Krivoi Rog.General.21. The cutting of the, railway Lwow-Odessa, which the Germans havebeen defending for several weeks with the bulk of their armoured forces, is an event of the first importance. The Germans will now be faced with considerablesupply difficulties in South Russia, where the railways leading from Roumaniahave only a very limited capacity.Russian progress in the past week has been made in spite of a sudden thaw,which has made movement difficult on the whole front and especially in theextreme south. Although the Russian break-through in the Shepetovka area isthe outstanding feature of the week&apos;s fighting, the Russians have also had a con-siderable success in the north, where, by crossing the Narva, they have penetrateda strongly fortified line which the Germans almost certainly intended to hold.The next prepared defence line which has been reported in this sector runs S.E.from Riga along the River Dvina.Italy.22. Last week this Resume reported a heavy enemy attack on the U.S.sector of the bridgehead front. We now know that this was carried out with a strength of about three equivalent divisions, and all evidence goes to show thatthe attack was regarded by the enemy as having great significance. Its net effect was territorially nil, as the enemy gained no ground whatsoever and our troops,whom General Alexander reports as fighting very well, inflicted heavy casualties.Despite this rebuff, a further enemy attack, although on a smaller scale, developedon the afternoon of the 2nd, when infantry and tanks were again directed S.W.from Cisterna. This&apos;was broken up by U.S. artillery, and the counter-attackthat was put in by a U.S. infantry regiment completely restored the line,bringing it up to include the bridge at Ponte Retto, 2 miles S.W. of Cisterna.Activity on the British sector of the front, to the west of the Anzio-Rome road,was sharp in the early part of the week, although on a small scale. Several smallunsuccessful local enemy attacks were reported, and our Commando patrols killed and wounded many of the enemy. Since the 6th there has been an almost complete lull in the bridgehead. Regrouping and reliefs have gone on amongstour forces, which includes the arrival of more British personnel.Despite bad weather and enemy action, the unloading of supplies at the port of Anzio has not been unsatisfactory.
23. There are no territorial changes to report from either the Fifth orEighth Army fronts. On the main Fifth Army sector regrouping and reorganisation -sation is in process and further infantry reinforcements, U.S., French andBritish, have arrived in the battle area. The River Rapido, which last week was reported as overflowed, has now somewhat subsided. Artillery and mortar firehas been active on both sides in the Cassino sector, and there has been some sharpshelling along the Garigliano front. In the latter sector, a slight withdrawal bya U.S. unit had to be made in face of a small enemy attack a mile south of Castel-forte. On the Eighth Army front active patrolling has continued and here againenemy shelling has been on an increased scale. Two small enemy attacks in theOrsogna sector,were successfully repulsed. The weather deteriorated seriouslyon the 6th, and there was heavy snow on the high ground along the whole Armyfront; this has hampered patrol work.Yugoslavia.24. In Herzgovina the Partisans have gained control of the roads for someway inland from Dubrovnik and have captured the town of Lastva (20 miles east of Dubrovnik).Fighting continues near Kalinovik (20 miles south of Sarajevo), after the partisans had driven off a German attempt to enter the town.The airfield at Sinj (20 miles north of Split) in Dalmatia was attacked byPartisans who burnt all the buildings.The Partisans scored another success in Croatia where they drove off aGerman attack, supported by tanks, from the town of Glina (40 miles south ofZagreb).In Italian Slovenia Partisans have been engaged against German SS Troops,killing 300 of the enemy within 14 days.Greece.Operations against the Enemy.25. On the 1st and 2nd fighting between E.L.A.S. and German troops tookplace N.E. of Arta.Civil War.26. Agreement has at last been reached between the rival factions.E.A.M./E.L.A.S., Zervas and E.K.K.A. undertook on the 29th February not toattack each other and to confine their activities to the areas then held. A mixed commission has been set up to supervise the execution of this agreement.Burma.A arakan.27. Fighting, east of the Mayu Range, has continued behind the original7th Indian Division front, and the Japanese in this area have been considerably reduced. On the 6th/7th the 7th Indian Division resumed the offensive on their original front, and captured four hill features about two miles south of Letwadetwhich they held in face of a subsequent Japanese counter-attack. The japanese have infiltrated into positions on the left flank of the West African Troopsadvancing down the Kaladan Valley, &quot;and are exerting pressure in the area about four miles north of Kyauktaw, where they have cleared the east bank of theKaladan River and established a bridgehead onthe west bank. The West african troops have made some withdrawal to deal with this threat.Hukawng Valley.28.   Chinese and U.S. troops captured Maingkwan on the 5th.Pacific.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)New Guinea.29.   Allied patrols are now about 20 miles west of Saidor.   On the 5th afurther U.S. landing was made at Pommern Bay, about 10 miles further west and about 25 miles east of Bogadjim.   The landing was made unopposed under cover of a land and air bombardment.   Operations are proceeding satisfactorily.[27076] b 2
New Britain.30. The Japanese are still believed to be withdrawing from Western NewBritain. . On the 6th, U.S. Marines made a fresh landing against slightopposition at Volupai (north of C. Schelling), on the west coast of theWilliaumez Peninsula, about 120 miles east of Cape Gloucester and 60 miles east of the Allied forces advancing overland. No details of the scale of this landingare yet available.Admiralty Islands.31. The U.S. force which landed on Los Negros on the 29th February have held Momote airfield in face of determined counter-attacks, as a result of which1,000 Japanese dead have been counted up to the 6th. U.S. reinforcements have continued to arrive, and the airfield is reported to be now ready for use, and the island under complete control.Solomons.32. An airfield has now been constructed on Nissan Island, the largest of the green Islands, which was occupied by New Zealand forces about three weeks ago.AIR SITUATION.General Review.33. U.S. heavy bombers made two heavy daylight attacks on.targets in the berlin area.Aircraft of Bomber Command attacked aircraft factories and railway centres in France.In the Anzio bridgehead and on the Fifth Army Front air support was provided.for our land forces.In the Pacific, Allied aircraft operated in strength against Rabaul.United Kingdom.34.

Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 25th Februaryare of poor quality and the presence of haze and cloud renders assessment of damage difficult. It can be seen, however, that in the Bachmann bomber aircraftcomponents and repair factory, severe damage has been caused to stores, offices,a boiler house, a garage and to several unidentified buildings.Oschersleben. Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the20th February show that all the important buildings of the Ago FlugzeugwerkeG-.m.b.H. have been damaged in some degree.
