THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty  &apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  March 1944. 1 [) 3SECRETW.P. (44) 176.29th March, 1944.mWAR CABINET.THE WASHINGTON CONVERSATIONS.A Warning from America.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.THE United States Department of Commerce has just published a detailedsurvey, entitled &quot; The United States in the World Economy,&quot; of the internationaltransactions of the United States in the inter-war period. This has been reprintedby His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office and should be carefully read, marked, learnedand inwardly digested, by every member of the War Cabinet before this countrycommits itself, or attempts to commit the Empire, to policies whose dangerouscharacter is so clearly set out in this remarkable document.The story begins with the immediate post-war boom in 1919-20 and its abruptreversal by the &apos;&apos; sharp recession in business activity in the United States &apos;&apos;towards the end of 1920. From this other countries were enabled, according tothe authors of the Report (pp. 3-4) to make a rapid recovery because the inter-national gold standard had not yet been restored and they were thus able to avoidinternal deflation by getting rid of their gold stocks or by depreciation.The years from 1922 to 1929 were marked, &quot; despite internal currencydisorders, controversies over reparations and war debts, and some growth of tariff barriers,&quot; by world-wide economic expansion. The restoration of the goldstandard was generally carried out and made possible by an immense volume of american lending, encouraged by the United States Government and pushedvigorously by American financial houses attracted by high interest rates. In thefour years from 1926 to 1929 America poured between $7,300,000,000 and$7,500,000,000 into other countries, more particularly into Europe. Most of thisinvestment, indeed, took place before the middle of 1928, when the attraction ofthe domestic boom deflected American interest from other markets. There was aslight revival in 1930, in the earlier phase of the American slump, but from thenon practically the whole American support of the European economy was with-drawn. On top of it there was an almost equally complete suspension of the immense American expenditure on tourist traffic and of home remittances byEuropean workers in America (pp. 71-79). A sharp upward revision of theAmerican tariff in 1930 only aggravated the disequilibrium. The measure of thereversal of policy is shown by a graph (p. 6) giving the total excess of dollarssupplied by the United States through new investment abroad and purchases ofgoods and services over debt service payments to the United States as c      $6,500,000,000 in 1929 and $1,500,000,000 in 1932, a shrinkage of 77 per cent.Against the tremendous momentum of these unforeseeable fluctuations onthe part of the American economic system, which already in 1929 equalled, bothin industrial production and in money income, the economic systems of theworld added together (see diagrams on p. 28), the individual nations were atfirst helpless. Paralysed by their reluctance to abandon the gold standard,their &quot;endeavour to defend their exchange parities and reserve positions let the task of readjustmnt in their external demands fall full force on their internal economic life, thus strengthening the forces of depression and deflation through-out the world generally.&quot;[27172] .    .  .Copy No.
In the end they were forced to take the remedy into their own hands andby one method or another, to get rid of the whole automatic system based oiithe gold standard and the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause. The gold standardwas abandoned, tariffs were raised, direct trade and exchange control was usedto keep trade within selected channels and limit it to the available supply ofexchange, while preferential and commercial arrangements fostered trade between those directly participating, and diverted it from other sources ofsupply. These techniques enabled the countries concerned to &apos;&apos; absorb shocksfrom the outside without transmitting undue pressure to their internal economicstructures&quot; (p. 11). They were most effective in those countries which were able to insulate themselves most completely and less effective in countries whichlike Canada for instance (p. 195), were &quot;perforce heavily dependent on theUnited States market.&quot;The record of the thirties demonstrated that foreign countries, savefor those narrowly dependent on the American market, could adapt them-selves, after initial serious disturbances, to a relatively low level of exchangewith the United States and yet attain a substantial-internal prosperity and promote their trade with each other.&apos;&apos; In general, the most successful adaptation was achieved by countries that depreciated their currencies and thereafter were able to pursue policies of monetary ease or to adopt more positive measures of economic expansionwithout the necessity of defending rigid gold parities. The members ofthe sterling bloc were, on the whole, outstanding. They not only attained,for the most part, their pre-depression levels of production arid income by1935, but also maintained virtually complete exchange stability among them-selves, once the realinement of their currency ratios had been made duringthe depression, without depending on exchange controls or other intricatemeasures of direct intervention in the trading mechanism (p.- 194).&quot;Not only was recovery rapid and far-reaching in the countries whichhad recourse to these measures of total or partial insulation, but it was more rapid, more complete and steadier than in the United States (p. 10). Whereasunder the internationalist gold standard and Most-Favoured-Nation system setup in the twenties the mere cessation of American investment had spelled disasterto the world, the world was able, without detriment to its own recovery andevidently without help to the American economy, to retransfer capital to america, between 1934 and 1939, to the extent of $6,000,000,000 (p. 7).The authors of the Report are unhesitating in their main, conclusion. they believe in a single international trade and investment system the kind of system, in fact, which is continually expounded to the world by&apos; the presentAmerican administration and which is envisaged in the Washington discussions.But they realise that it can only come into effect without disaster to the rest ofthe world and to America on certain conditions.&apos;&apos; A world economic structure organised on the basis of equal treatment and with large scope for free enterprise cannot be maintained in the face ofsuch reductions in the supply of dollars as have occurred in our internationaltransactions in the past. Unless the supply of dollars is more.adequate tomeet the requirements of other countries, they assuredly will insist on their right to exercise a close selective control over the use of the amounts available,and to promote more intensive relations * with third countries underpreferential trading arrangements. And unless dollars are made availablewith greater regularity than in the past, it would be both unjust and unwise to demand the removal of restraints and controls largely designed to protect the internal economies of other countries against external shock andpressure (p. 13).&quot; ,&apos;&apos; Moreover, as domestic factors appear to have been chiefly responsiblefor the violence of our economic fluctuations in the past, so the remedies mustbe found largely through the development of a sounder internal economic andfinancial structure (p. 14).&quot;&quot; By way of final conclusion, based on the experience of the entire inter-war period, and strongly reinforced by events toward the end of the period,it is clear that-whatever may be the other requirements stability in international economic relations generally and in foreign exchange rates inparticular cannot be assured solely or chiefly through technical financial arrangements, but must be firmly based on a vigorously and regularlyfunctioning domestic economy (p. 200).&quot;
What guarantee is there that these conditions of internal economic stability in the United States and consistency in American external expenditure or invest-ment are likely to be fulfilled ? The authors of the report have no. suggestions to offer in this field. They simply note that on physical principles&quot;force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration,&quot; and that the immense&quot; mass &quot; of the United States in the world economy has so far been accompaniedby an &quot;amplitude and vigor of industrial fluctuations considerably morepronounced than in foreign countries.&quot; Do the trifling relaxations envisaged bythe Washington discussions in the application of a rigid exchange standard or of aseverely &apos;&apos; ceilinged &apos;&apos; tariff system afford any adequate or prompt insulationagainst the devastating effects of internal economic fluctuations in the UnitedStates, whose&quot; mass &quot; and &quot; momentum &quot; relative to the rest of the world will beeven greater after this war than in the inter-war period ? Will the relatively small sums available through the monetary scheme or the proposed investmentfund have any adequate steadying effect as compared with what free Americancitizens will decide to do with their money by way of investment, purchase ortravel ? Will the mere reduction of the American tariff afford any guarantee against vast fluctuations in the sum total of American imports ? Can any onecontemplate the terrific economic and political issues which the New Deal and theWar have raised in American life and imagine, for one moment, that&apos;the future course of American economy, internal or external, will be that smooth, consistent,far-sightedly planned and self-restrained affair which the Report postulates as essential to the working of an internationalist world order? And if not, thenis it not sheer madness for the nations of the world, or of the British Empire and commonwealth, to abdicate beforehand their right, whether singly or in com-bination with each other, to insulate themselves by any and every appropriate method from the overwhelming impact of the fluctuations of the American system ?The Washington proposals are a sheer death-trap from which we must at allhazards extricate ourselves.How then are we, or the rest of the world, to secure that American financial help which is said to be so essential for recovery after the war? The answer isprovided, again with the most unconscious frankness, by the authors of the Report.Discussing the whole problem of American external investment they draw a sharpdistinction between ordinary loan investment and what they call &quot; direct &quot; invest-ment, i.e., American financial participation in foreign industries or the settingup by American firms of branch industries in other countries.&quot; The most promising outlet for private American capital would seemto be direct investments. During the inter-war period investment of capital in the form of enterprises partly or wholly under American control yieldedresults that were, in general, more satisfactory from several points of viewthan investments in foreign dollar bonds. Direct investments proved to be far less of a burden on the international exchanges in times of depression,being subject to variable returns in the currency of the capital-importingcountry rather than to fixed debt charges in dollars .... Another compara-tive advantage of direct investments indicated by the experience of theinter-war period is that they made a more positive contribution throughdevelopment of industrial capacity toward strengthening the general economic position of capital-importing countries .... Joint participationby American and foreign business interests has already yielded excellent results in some countries, notably Canada and the United Kingdom, and.similar methods might well be more extensively employed in other areas(p. 20).&quot; .&quot; Most American investments in foreign, manufacturing concerns are in countries well advanced industrially. Tariffs, especially the British imperial preference scheme, have been particularly important in this development(p. 102).&quot;In other words, if we of the British Empire and Commonwealth wantAmerican capital on terms least calculated to endanger our own economy andalso most promising for the American investor, we must encourage that capital to come to us by tariffs and preferences sufficiently high to keep out the goods which it would otherwise make in America and send over here. The procedure is one which American capital has already followed on a very large scale inCanada, and which British capital has followed in Australia and in other-Dominions, to the mutual advantage of all concerned.
The American Department of Commerce may have hoped for a Report whichwould give its unquestioning blessing to the official American policy, as embodied in Article VII of the Lease-Lend Agreement, of a restoration of the automaticand non-discriminatory i.e., promiscuous and unregulated economy of the nineteenth century. If so, then the painstakingly honest authors of the Reporthave, indeed, proved Balaams in disguise. If they have not directly cursed thepolicy they were invited to bless they have made it clear that it must provedisastrous to all concerned, including America, unless accompanied by conditionswhose fulfilment is left, so far as the Report is concerned, in the realm of piousaspiration. And if they have not directly blessed the formation of substantialnation groups bound together by mutual preferences and currency arrangements and thus effectively insulated against the tidal waves of American economicvagaries, their statistics, facts and, indeed, their whole argument point irresis-tibly to that conclusion as the obvious path of safety.
