IT will I think, be of interest to my colleagues to see the following report&apos; by the United Kingdom High  Commissioner  in Australia on  the recentAustralia-New Zealand Agreement.C.Dominions Office, S.W. 1,23rd&apos; March, 1944.(No. 73.)My Lord, Canberra, 18th February, 1944.I have the honour to submit the following report on the recently concludedagreement between Australia and New Zealand on Pacific affairs.2. Upon receipt of your telegram No. 1454 of the 4th December, informalenquiries were made of the External Affairs Department as to whether any information could be made available regarding the purpose and scope of theforthcoming discussion between Australian and New Zealand Ministers.Officials, however, were found most reticent and my own approach to the PrimeMinister was equally barren of result. It became clear that definite instructionsmust have been issued by the Minister for External Affairs that no information regarding the discussions or later as to the terms of the agreement between thetwo Governments was to be given. In the result the only information which was obtained was that communicated to the press.3. In my telegram No. 1934 of the 23rd December, 1942, I reported thatthere were indications that the Department of External Affairs might heentertaining ambitious ideas as to Australia^ future in the South-West Pacificand South-East Asia. At this date there was some reason to suppose that these included the participation of the Commonwealth in the administration of theNetherlands East Indies after the war. These proposals reached the ears of theDutch Minister whose reaction appears to have been such that the idea was dropped and subsequent references to Australia^ place in the post-war Pacificworld have been restricted to areas closer to Australia. An examination of thevarious statements made by Dr. Evatt during the past year will show how hisideas have developed.4. In a broadcast address on the 1st February, 1943, Dr. Evatt said &quot; close to Australia there is a very special zone suitable for the performance of our obligations towards the United Nations in the post-war world,&quot; and went onto say that he saw nothing in Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement whichthreatened Australian industries. &quot; On the contrary, I see in it cogent evidenceof a more liberal world economic policy in which Australia will, through rapidindustrial expansion, help to achieve the great objective of freedom from want,not only in our own country and its territories, but especially in those areas whichare associated with our defence in time of war and with our industrial progressin time of peace.&quot;  At a press conference in Washington in April 1943, Dr. Evatt[27144]
moved a stage further and made it clear that Australia expected to be givencontrol of some Pacific islands after the war. &quot; Australia, as the leading nationof the South Pacific zone, would have special concern in the economic as well asthe strategic arrangements of the Pacific after the war .... In short, we mustbase the future Pacific policy on a doctrine of trusteeship.&quot; In July last theCabinet appointed a Committee to plan for the Post-War Reconstruction and rehabilitation of the Territories of Papua, New Guinea and Nauru. ThisCommittee was also asked to report on &quot; any steps to be taken to correlate theadministration of Commonwealth External Territories to other areas of a similarnature in the Pacific.&quot; In August 1943, I forwarded an article contributed byDr. Evatt to the Melbourne Herald, in which he claimed that Australia mustextend its responsibilities &quot; further towards the north and north-west, and thenorth-east and east.&quot; In this article he said that it was obvious that there wouldhave to be zones of security, and &apos;&apos; of crucial importance to Australia will be such islands as Timor, New Guinea, the Solomons, the New Hebrides, Fiji andNew Caledonia.&quot; He added : &quot; Of course, we have no desire for aggrandisementor prejudicing the sovereignty of the Netherlands, France or Portugal,&quot; and hevisualised &quot; the formation of a great South-West Pacific zone of security against aggression. . . . Whatever Australia does will be done in the closest co-operationwith Britain because we are trustees of British civilisation in this part ofthe world.&quot; Finally, in his statement to Parliament at the close of the last session, Dr. Evatt claimed that Australia had special interests both from thecommercial and strategic point of view in the island territories and that those territories, with Papua and New Guinea, should form one of the zones withinthe international system which must be established. He foreshadowed &apos;&apos; a frankexchange of views between accredited representatives in the South-western pacific,&quot; including among those the Government of New Zealand.5. The matter was also referred to by the Prime Minister in his address to the Labour Party Conference, in which he mentioned the primary interestof Australia and New Zealand in Pacific problems and suggested the co-operationof Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand in a regional organistion inthe South-Western Pacific as &quot;an essential component of world organisation.&quot;6. Superficially viewed the agreement consists to a large extent of anexposure of hopes and desires, fears and suspicions, compounded with some self-advertisement, and borrowed notions. It is a bid to achieve, by proclamation,political ends that the Commonwealth Government feel they would have had farless chance of attaining by diplomatic negotiation and it is a bid by the ambitiousDr. Evatt to achieve something of historical significance and value with whichhis name would be particularly identified. One may, indeed, reasonably questionwhether Dr. Evatt&apos;s ambition has not somewhat overwhelmed his sense of proportion. But, even though there be an element of truth in this suggestion,it is also, I believe, true that Dr. Evatt, conscious that the two countries are, interms of nationhood, boys, decided to reap the advantages of being boys; a pastimethat ex hypothesi would prove impossible if the maternal partner were consulted.The agreement, however, whilst of course conceived as being primarily in theboys&apos; interest, is also conceived to be in the interest of the family as a whole andof the maternal partner in particular.7. As a whole, the agreement suffers from the defect that it involves a bidto establish a regional defence zone in advance of the formation of a world security system, and that the multiplication of such regional zones in different parts of the world might well render impossible, both politically and practically,the formation of a world security system. Moreover, the agreement is a bid toestablish a bloc of United Nations within the United Nations as a whole; a courseliable to arouse animosities between the United Nations.8. However, it is in itself an important and valuable thing, at least inappearance, that these two essentially British countries, close neighbours, facedwith similar external problems, should have got together and agreed to think and act together in all that concerns their future security and welfare. This piece of realism has been brought about by the perception of their own militaryweakness, and even more importantly by the predatory attitude of the UnitedStates towards territories of the Southern Pacific. Belatedly recognising thatit is beyond the power of the United Kingdom to fight major wars on both sides of the world at the same time, the two Dominions have sought to make common cause with other countries with interests in the Southern Pacific islands in maintaining their own defence in preference to relying primarily upon the
United States. Unification of policy on the external affairs of the two Dominionsis the necessary first step, and the co-ordination of defensive measures is a corollary. It remains, however, to be seen how far the New Zealanders will beprepared to rely upon Australia as their sole external source of advice, and to exclude the counsel of the United Kingdom, on matters of common Australian-New Zealand concern.9. Whilst the objections to the formation at the present time of a regionaldefence zone and a separate bloc within the United Nations may rule out themore striking features of the agreement, it may nevertheless serve a useful purpose to make some comment upon them. The most important project in theagreement is the &quot; Security and Defence Zone.&quot; In effect, the two Dominionshave drawn a line on the map; a line somewhat ambiguous in parts round alarge region in which they themselves live, and have proclaimed that they proposethat they and the other Governments possessing territories within that area should retain entire possession of their own territories, and that they .shouldmanage all their own affairs within that region, including the responsibilities oflocal defence. They let it emerge clearly that they would object to any outsideinterference with these indubitable rights, and it is obvious from the drawingof the line and in other ways that it is United States interference with theirpossessions that they apprehend. In taking this local stand Australia and NewZealand clearly feel that they can count upon the agreement in principle of theforeign Governments concerned in the region in question : namely, the Nether-lands and Portuguese Governments and the French Committee of national liberation, all of whom may be safely assumed to have a similar desire to retain their full sovereignty and to have also some apprehension lest demands be madeencroaching upon that sovereignty. Indeed the agreement goes further, for itcarries to these nations a reassurance from Australia herself in regard to herintentions toward Timor, New Guinea and New Caledonia. In this connection(see paragraph 2) it is worth noting that Dr. Evatt is known at one time tohave used indiscreet language concerning a Dutch-Australian &apos;&apos; condominium &apos;&apos;in at least part of the Netherlands East Indies and that this fact is known tothe Dutch authorities. The remaining Government concerned in the zone isthat of the United Kingdom. Here it is evident that the view taken was that whilst the United Kingdom might well have felt unable to be party to the agree-ment itself, she would nevertheless be not displeased with the demarche andwould feel it to be in general desirable to support the scheme.10. In sum, the Security and Defence Zone declaration amounts to aproposal to establish a Monroe Doctrine covering a large proportion of the territories of the Pacific situated south of the Equator. No doubt Dr. Evattwould have preferred that the agreement should have covered all, or almost all,the Pacific islands south of the Equator but was limited in the drawing of hiseastern boundary by the fact that the Eastern Samoan islands are a United Statespossession. A number of United Kingdom dependencies is consequently omitted from the zone; a fact which tends to spoil the presentation of the picture. Itwould be argued by the two Dominions that the boundaries they have sketchedcomprised the islands essential for local defence, plus their own dependencies,and other islands that inevitably fell within the defence boundary, and that theyhad neither reason nor excuse for proposing a policy that went further afield.11. A second very important feature of the agreement is the &quot; South SeasRegional Commission &quot; for the promotion of the welfare of native peoples. it also emerges clearly from the agreement that the two Dominions are apprehensivelest China should succeed in bringing such pressure to bear upon them thatthey would be unable to maintain their white immigration policies. the territories to which the South Seas Regional Commission might relate are different from those embraced by the Security and Defence Zone. In particular,the Regional Commission includes the United States and omits the netherlands east Indies. Basing themselves apparently upon ethnological types that inhabitBritish territories, namely Melanesians and Polynesians, the two Dominionsinvite the co-operation of other Governments responsible for natives of the samestock. Thus they include the United States by virtue of East Samoa and otherdependencies, and exclude the Netherlands East Indies, which, though they havea certain Melanesian population, are mainly inhabited by people of Indonesianstock amongst whom are important Chinese elements.12. Whilst the Defence and Security Zone is intended to prevent UnitedStates infiltration within its bounds, it is hoped that the &quot; South Seas Regional
Committee &quot; (in which United States participation is suggested) will constitute an instrument which will aid in imposing a bar to infiltration by Chinese migrantsinto the South-West and South Pacific.13. There is thus a bid to set up two political blocs, one primarily in self-defence against the United States, whilst the other might constitute a safeguard against Chinese immigration. At the same time it is hoped that the countriesconstituting the Security and Defence Zone would attain such political cohesionas to establish a fresh political entity in the Pacific which, since it would includethe United Kingdom, Holland, France, Australia and New Zealand, would bea power to be reckoned with. No doubt such projects cannot be considered at thepresent time. It is, however, known that Dr. Evatt&apos;s ideas do not stop atco-operation within the region he has delineated. He also desires that theCommonwealth Government should take over the administration of the BritishSolomons, and he no doubt turns a predatory eye towards other islands not inBritish possession.14. It was prophesied at the time that the agreement was published that, sofar as the press was concerned, it would be little more than a week-end wonder,and this has in fact proved to be the case. There has been surprisingly littleattention paid to the agreement in editorial comment, which has, however, on thewhole, been favourable so far as the agreement will conduce to smoothing out the differences between the two countries and providing the machinery for futurecloserco-operation, but extremely cautious as regards those clauses of the agreement which relate to other than purely domestic matters. Some of the more responsibleorgans have singled out for special notice the &apos;&apos; hands off&apos;&apos; caution to the UnitedStates, but the press as a whole appears to realise that in these matters the agree-ment is treading on. dangerous ground. There has been very little prominencegiven to United States press reaction, but I am unable to say, without knowingwhat has been said by the United States Press, whether it is to some extent dueto censorship. Apart from an occasional reference, however, the agreement ina few days ceased to be front-page news and the debate which is taking place at the moment in Parliament has done little to revive interest in the agreement.I have, &amp;c.(for High Comimssioner)W.
