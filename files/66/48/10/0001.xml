r-,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1944.3SECRET.W.P. (49) 160.15th March, 1944.&quot;HiCopy Nplti WAR CABINET.IRELAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I circulate for the information of the War Cabinet the following papersregarding the replies of Canada, Australia and New Zealand to Mr. de Valera&apos;request for their intervention in regard to the recent United States approach.- &apos; .: &apos;    C.Dominions Office, 15th March, 1944.(1)Statement by Canadian Prime Minister in Canadian Parliament, 13th March.I had anticipated an enquiry from the Leader of the Opposition, and have prepared a short statement for the information of the House, with regard to thereports which have appeared in the press recently concerning representations which have been made to the Irish Government by the Government of the UnitedStates requesting the expulsion of German and Japanese diplomatic and consular representatives from Ireland.   &quot;On Friday evening, the 10th March, the state department in Washington made public the text of the United States note of the21st February, and simultaneously the Irish Legation in Washington announced the reply of the Irish Government.   On the same date a newspaper report from london made the statement that Mr. de Valera had appealed to me &quot; to mediate&quot; in the affair shortly after the presentation of the United States note.It may perhaps clarify matters if I say at the outset that the Canadian Govern-ment has not in any way endeavoured to mediate between the Irish Governmentand the United States Government;  also that such representations as were received were in the nature of informal confidential conversations.   Shortly afterthe presentation of the notes, Mr. de Valera sent for Mr. Kearney, our HighCommissioner in Ireland, and told him that he considered it would be in the mutual interest of Ireland and the United Nations if, through the intervention of a friendly nation, the notes might be withdrawn.  He suggested Canada mightbe willing to assume this task, and asked Mr. Kearney to put his request beforethe  Canadian  Government.    Subsequently  Mr.   Hearne,   the  Irish  HighCommissioner came to see me personally.  In my reply it was made clear that, asthe Canadian Government was in full sympathy with the object of the approachmade by the United States Government, it would not wish to intervene in thematter.   I believe that the informal discussions which took place, through mr.. Kearney in Dublin and with Mr. Hearne here, were of some help at the timein steadying a difficult situation.   Since there were no written communicationsexchanged between the Irish and Canadian Governments, there are no documents to be tabled.   Mr. de Valera made it very plain that his Government had done,and would continue to do, its utmost to prevent the Axis representatives now on[27106] .
its soil from using their position there to secure information which could be usedto the disadvantage of the United Nations. At the same time, there can be nodoubt in the minds of any of us that the Axis representatives will not hesitate to abuse the privileges that have been granted them as diplomatic or consular representatives in Ireland, if by such abuse they can in any way injure theUnited Nations.(2)Note of Oral Communication made by Mr. Bruce to the High Commissioner forEire in London.&quot; . . . . that the Australian Government did not see its way to intervene soas to secure the withdrawal of the American note, and that the attitude of theAustralian Government was that they were in accord with the American request that the German and Japanese representatives should be expelled, and hoped thatthe Eire Government would agree to take action asked for in the American note.&quot;(3)Telegram of 9th March, 1944, from New Zealand Government to New ZealandHigh Commissioner in London.Secret,No. 236. &apos; Your telegram No. 404 and my message to Secretary of Staterepeated to you as No. 215.After further consideration of tJhe situation arising out of the UnitedStates request that Axis diplomatic representatives should be removed fromDublin, my own attitude may be summed up as follows: The friendship of Eireis greatly valued and we appreciate the efforts their Government have made to institute security measures against espionage by the Axis Powers. It seems,nevertheless, that information on matters of military importance can, and, infact does, leave the country. The recent landing of parachutists in Eire,carrying wireless sets, adds point to this contention, and the fact cannot be ignored that any such leakages as occur necessarily involve the lives of NewZealanders, as well as those of the other members of the British commonwealth and the United Nations.We had hoped the time would arrive when it would be possible for the eire government to accede to the request now made by the United States authorities,and while there may be circumstances which render it difficult for Eire to agreeat the present moment, I would like you to represent to Dulanty that this must,nevertheless, be regarded as our considered attitude. If the Government of Eire is unable to take action in accordance with the United States note, then I cannotrefrain from expressing the hope that such other steps, short of those suggestedby the United States, will be taken in order to prevent any possible futureleakages.For my own part, I feel that any other expression of views could only beregarded as tantamount to opposition towards the United States request, and Iwould, moreover, feel that I was failing in my duty to do everything possible toprotect our own men.I feel certain that the United States Government do not intend to press the matter as a major issue, nor, I am certain, do they intend their note to beregarded as an ultimatum, but they no doubt felt, as indeed we hoped, that theoccasion would provide the Government of Eire with a suitable opportunity totake such steps as those suggested.
