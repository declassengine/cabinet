SECRET. Copy No.     3 6W.P. (44) 184.4th April, 1944.WAR CABINET.CIVIL DEFENCE AND HOME GUARD MAN-POWER.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.AT their meeting on the 1st December, 1943, the War Cabinet set up aCommittee consisting of the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security, theSecretary of State for War and myself to state the extent to which Civil defence work was already undertaken by the Home Guard and to consider whether itwould be practicable to secure some further merging of these two Services(W.M. (43) 164th Meeting, Conclusion (6)).2. At our request the Departments directly concerned (the Home, War and scottish Offices, and the Ministries of Home Security and Labour and NationalService) have reviewed the arrangements already in existence for mutual assist-ance between the two Services and have submitted to us certain conclusions,together with recommendations regarding future action. These conclusions andrecommendations, in which we concur, are set out in the Annex to thismemorandum.We recommend that the War Cabinet should accept the conclusions recorded in paragraphs 1-4 and in paragraph 6 of the Annex, and should authorise theDepartments directly concerned at once to put into effect the recommendationsset out in paragraph 5.3. The new Fire Guard orders prescribe a reorganisation of the fire guardat business premises by which a smaller number of persons will be required forthat duty at premises where, hitherto, there has been a surplus. The changeoverto the new system is in process, and the Ministry of Home Security and theScottish Home Department, in conjunction with other Government departments which are &apos;&apos; appropriate authorities &quot; or &quot; appropriate departments &apos;&apos; under theOrder, are doing their best to expedite this process. We consider, however, thatthe necessary reorganisation might be stimulated if the War Cabinet were to issue a direction urging upon all Departments the need for completing it as quickly aspossible.4. The proposals set out in paragraph 5 of the Annex are designed to enablethe Civil Defence General Services, the National Fire Service and the home guard, by means of increased mutual assistance and by certain limited re-alloca-tion of personnel, to meet their existing commitments. It must be recognised that,until a revised operational appreciation enables a reduction to be made in thosecommitments, there is no possibility of these three Services as a whole being ableto release personnel for other sectors of the war effort. This makes it all the moreimportant that the commitments of the three Services should be kept under constant review. We accordingly recommend that the War Cabinet should ask the Chiefs of Staff to submit a revised operational appreciation as soon as opera-tions on the Continent have progressed far enough to make this possible.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,4th April, 1944.[27211]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; --11 iiiii mi b,Printed for the War Cabinet.

ANNEX.Conclusions and Recommendations Submitted by the departments directly Concerned.(1) Any degree of merging in the strict sense of unification of control betweenthe Home Guard and Civil Defence is not practicable at the present stage of thewar.(2) Until a revised operational appreciation enables a reduction to be madein commitments, no diminution in efficiency in any of the Services is acceptable;although certain reductions of strength by release for other services are recom-mended as possible in (5) (c) and (/) below. On the contrary, the Home Guardand Civil Defence General Services are below needed strength in the mostimportant areas, and adequate fire guard cover is unobtainable in many areas.Furthermore, the cuts to be imposed in the whole-time Civil Defence services during 1944 will increase their need for part-time personnel in certain areasunless the military situation changes for the better.(3) The number of persons not yet undertaking any form of national part-time service, but available for direction fey the Ministry of Labour, is by nowsmall.(4) The main sources, therefore, from which cuts in the whole-time strengthof the Civil Defence General Services can be made good through the recruiting of part-time members are : first, the Fire Guard and, second, the Home Guard.The main source to which the Home Guard can&apos; look for recruits must remain the Fire Guard.(5) To meet deficiencies in the Civil Defence General Services (and, as to (c),the National Fire Service) and the Home Guard, certain interdependent proposals are recommended : (a) that existing instructions should be reiterated and emphasised on boththe Civil and Military sides with the object of eliminating or reducingdifficulties of a psychological kind which have hitherto prevented full co-operation between the Home Guard and Civil Defence at lower levels;(b) that the Ministry of Labour and National Service should (i) continue to substitute women for male fire guards at business and government premises where such women are available on thescale of two women to one man where it can be shown thatthis has not already been done in areas where either the civil defence General Services or the Home Guard are in specialneed of men;(ii) substitute women for male fire guards at such premises on thescale of three women to one man in exceptional areas wherethe Regional Commissioner is satisfied that this is the proper course in view of the needs of the Civil Defence General services or the Home Guard in the area concerned;(c) that men of military age made available by these measures should bedirected by the Ministry of Labour into the Rescue Service, theNational Fire Service and the Home Guard in such order of priority,agreed at the appropriate levels, as will equalise the proportion of strength to ceiling in the three Services;(d) that the War Office should invite the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces,to instruct his subordinate commanders (i) to arrange for Home Guards to receive more advanced trainingthan hitherto in Civil Defence work in those places whereHome Guard assistance is needed;(ii) to secure that this training is begun as soon as possible;(iii) to agree that, on completion of training, men so trained will bemade available where needed by the Civil Defence Services, forstandby duty; it being understood that in general it willnotbe possible to apply these arrangements to the Sbuth-EasternCommand and the coastal areas of the Eastern and SouthernCommands; such special training being in addition to thegeneral elementary training now being given in many places,including the coastal belt of the South-East and South;
(e) that the Commander-in-Chief should also be invited to issue instructions that Home Guards, if not required for other military duty, are to turn out with the street fire party covering their homes if there is anincendiary attack in that area;(/) that the War Office should invite the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces,to consider the transfer of Home Guards to Civil Defence in thoseplaces where civil defence deficiencies cannot otherwise be made good,it being understood   -(i) that the concurrence of the local military commander will besubject to his right to satisfy himself after reference, ifnecessary, to the Regional Commissioner and the RegionalController of the Ministry of Labour and National Service that,as respects the area or particular premises concerned, womenhave been substituted for male fire guards to the full extentcontemplated in paragraph (5) (b) above;(ii) that training in Rescue Service duties as in (d) of Home Guardsdesignated for transfer will not be held up pending anyexamination of the question referred to in (i) above;(iii) that the arrangements set out above will not apply to certain cases where those arrangements would prejudice recruitment for Home Guard A.A. Units or for ground defence units of&quot; special importance.(6) In June 1943 the Prime Minister accepted the view of the Minister ofHome Security that the introduction of compulsory direction of Civil defence personnel into the Home Guard would not be justified. That question should notbe reopened at present.
