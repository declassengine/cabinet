THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT205 ^Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1944. \J^\SECRET. Copy No.   3 6W.P. (44) 188.5th April, 1944.v WAR CABINET.FACTORY MADE HOUSES.Directive by the Prime Minister.1. The reconditioning of bomb-damaged houses wherever it is possible andworth while should be our first step in housing, for that is how the greatestamount of accommodation can be most rapidly provided. A report should be furnished on this, showing what can be done at different stages during the warand after.2. A programme should be prepared for the erection in the period immediately after the end of the war of a large number of emergency houses.The Minister of Reconstruction, in consultation with the Departments concerned,will at once frame an estimate of the number required.3. One model of an emergency house will be put up by Saturday, the29th April. Opinion on this model should be obtained from a large number ofpersons including housewives who do their own housework.4. When the design has been settled, the question of capacity, labour and materials required in tne factories, which is being worked out by the Ministerof Works, will be handed over to the Minister of Production who should find out how much capacity would have to be set aside for the factory-making of partsduring the war to enable work to start on erecting emergency houses as soonas the war is over. When this estimate has been made, the Minister of defence will determine how much impingement on the war effort can be permitted forthis purpose.5. The erection of these emergency houses will be carried out by exceptionalmethods, on the lines of a military operation, especially where transport isrequired. The success of this undertaking is not to be impeded by reliance atany point on traditional methods.[27197]
6. The scheme will include provision for the mass production of fitmentsand furniture.7. Full use is to be made of pressed steel in the construction of theseemergency houses and, where appropriate, of fitments. This, besides relieving the strain on other materials, will help to tide over the gap while manufacturers are changing over from war to normal peace production.8. The whole of this emergency housing scheme must be viewed in relationto a Ten Years&apos; Plan for the steady, full-time employment of a considerablyenlarged building trade for permanent houses. Instead of a fever for three or four years and then a falling-off, the building trade should have a broad, steadyflow giving all its members a good assurance of employment and thus encouragingpiece-work.w. s. c.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,5th April, 1944.
