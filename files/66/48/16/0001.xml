THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 166.2Wh March, 1944.WAR CABINET.TRIAL OF M. PUCHEU.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. .MY colleagues may be interested to see the annexed note of the views recentlyexpressed to a member of this department by the former Minister at the FrenchEmbassy in London. Though the execution of M. Pucheu has now taken place,M. Cambon&apos;s remarks are not without interest, in view of the fact that he hasalways adopted a detached and critical attitude towards General de Gaulle andthe French Committee of National Liberation.A. E.Foreign Office, 20th March, 1944.ANNEX.I HAD a talk with M. Cambon this afternoon in the course of which we discussed the Pucheu trial. He asked me what my views were and I saidthat this, we felt, was a matter for Frenchmen to decide. He then said that hehad little sympathy for Pucheu. He was a man who had accepted to serve Vichybut had then sought to claim that he had mitigated the effects of Vichy collabora-tion with Germany. That was an untenable position. Nobody had obligedM. Pucheu to become Minister of the Interior of the Vichy Government and, quaMinister of the Interior, he must accept full responsibility for the action of the vichy Government in collaborating with Germany. He had recently discussed the future position in France with M. Gouin, the Socialist, whom he had seen in Algiers. The latter told him that in his particular constituency there wasa small town of 8,000 inhabitants. Among those 8,000 there were three or fourcollaborators who had acted as spies for Vichy and the Gestapo. This was aposition which would be found typical of most communes in France. After thewar he (M. Gouin) did not see what could prevent those three men being killed and, taking into account all the communes of France, that might well involve30,000 collaborators or spies of such character being killed by the inhabitants ofthe communes whom they had spied upon and marked for deportation toGermany. The only way in which a massacre of 30,000 could be prevented wouldbe if the central authority made it clear that they intended taking action against all the Ministers of the Interior and Chiefs of Police of the Vichy government who had been responsible for issuing the orders on which the small fry had acted.That was, in fact, the defence for the execution of Pucheu if it took place.M. Cambon blamed General Giraud very much for responsibility in bringingPucheu to North Africa. He said the General should have insisted on his ^goingabroad and not staying on French territory as his behaviour at Vichy had madehim anathema to the whole French resistance movement. M. Cambon said thathe thought General de Gaulle was in an extremely difficult position. If he allowed Pucheu to be executed, it would be said in bourgeois circles that he hadyielded to Communist pressure; if, on the other hand, he pardoned him, he wouldbe going in the face of the whole resistance movement. Whatever M. Cambon&apos;views about General de Gaulle, it was quite clear that he had no sympathy formen such as Pucheu who had accepted to serve the Vichy Government.O. C.
