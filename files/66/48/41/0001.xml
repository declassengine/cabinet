This matter formed the subject of the Report of a Royal Commissionissued in March 1939. The Report advocated measures of closer co-operation and association between the three-Territories, to be achieved through the creationof an inter-territorial Council which would help to co-ordinate- the Govern-ment Services of the Territories and to frame development plans. On thequestion of actual amalgamation the Commission considered that community of interest would eventually lead to political unity and that the UnitedKingdom Government should declare themselves in favour of amalgamation inprinciple although this conclusion was qualified in notes appended to the Reportby three of the Commissioners. The conclusion was evidently based on the viewthat the establishment of a solid bloc of British Territory in Southern-Central Africa was an objective which should be steadily pursued as conducivealike to the stability and security of the Empire and to the progressive well-being of both Europeans and natives in this part of Africa. The Commissionadmitted, however, that there were certain serious difficulties which would haveto be overcome before the ultimate objective of amalgamation could be achieved in practice, the principal difficulty being the divergence of native policy betweenSouthern Rhodesia on the one hand and Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland onthe other.3. Owing to the outbreak of war it was impossible for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to come to a decision on the question. In 1940 Lord Hailey, whowas visiting other African Territories to study the system of native administra-tion, was asked to advise whether there were such divergencies between thepolicy of Southern Rhodesia and that of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland astc present an obstacle to amalgamation. Lord Hailey&apos;s conclusion was that,while the position as to the provision of services for the welfare of natives in .Southern Rhodesia compared not unfavourably with that in the other Territories,the limits which Southern Rhodesia imposes on the employment of africans in industry and in the administrative services and which it would propose toapply to their association in the political institutions of the country wouldweigh strongly against a policy of amalgamation.4. Lord Hailey&apos;s note has not been published, and it was stated in theHouse of Commons on the 5th March, ,1942, that, as it was impossible for HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and for Parliament to give thenecessary consideration to the amalgamation issue in present circumstances, ithad been agreed with the Government of Southern Rhodesia that publication ofthe note should be deferred until due consideration of the problem of amalgama-tion became practicable. Though Sir Godfrey Huggins seems to have accepted this as meaning that the matter should be left in abeyance during the war, he stated publicly in May 1943 that he thought that &apos;&apos; as soon as the embarrassmentcaused by the war departs we should, as a Colony, definitely put up a big fight[27232]
for immediate amalgamation with the Northern Territories.&quot; As Sir G.Huggins will be visiting this country shortly, he will no doubt expect to enterinto preliminary confidential discussions on the subject.5. When Sir Godfrey Huggins speaks of amalgamation, he has in mind the creation of a State embracing the existing Territories of Southern Rhodesia,Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland governed by a Cabinet and by a singleLegislature; the laws&quot; would be applied by an expanded Rhodesian Civil Serviceand the actions of the Government, except in relation to foreign affairs, would besubject to no greater control from without than that now exercised in respect ofSouthern Rhodesia by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs through thepower to veto Southern Rhodesia Bills which discriminate against natives. Thisveto has, in fact, never been used.6, There are certain serious objections to the amalgamation of the three territories. Such a course would be strongly opposed by African opinion, bothin Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and. elsewhere, and by a large section ofopinion in this country. In Southern Rhodesia native employment is limited bythe provisions of the Industrial Conciliation Act, which, in effect, constitute acolour bar. The colour bar has no place in the African policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom. It does not exist in Nyasaland, nor is itrecognised by the Government or countenanced by the law of Northern Rhodesia.In the latter Territory, however, there is in practice a colour bar on the railway,and the European mine workers have profited by the war-time need for maximum production and the avoidance of industrial disputes to make some progress,without any recognition from the Government, towards securing one on theCoppefbelt. The majority of the unofficial European population of northern rhodesia would favour the introduction of legislation on the lines of the SouthernRhodesia Industrial Conciliation Act. Ah amalgamated Territory withresponsible Government, as desired by Sir G. Huggins, would be governed inaccordance with the wishes of the Europeans of Southern and Northern Rhodesia;a colour bar would be established; and the new Government would not subscribe to the general policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the developmentof the native population of tropical Africa. For His Majesty&apos;s Government to hand over control of two Territories predominantly native to a Government, -the aims of whose native policy would be so largely at variance with those of HisMajesty&apos;s Government itself, would clearly be open to the most serious criticism.7. Moreover, it is clearly very doubtful whether the 70,000 Europeans in southern Rhodesia, assisted by not more than 15,000 Europeans in the northern territories, could produce the men, either in Parliament or in the Civil Service,capable of successfully accomplishing the task of governing a greater central african State containing over 5 million African natives. It would no doubt bepossible to obtain recruits for the service from outside the new State, but the ability of a newly elected Government to persist in this practice is doubtful, andthere might soon arise an outcry against the appointment of imported officials toposts of which the occupants must give decisions in disputes where the interestsof white and black are opposed. Generally, it may well be doubted whether,given the conditions likely to prevail, the amalgamated three Territories couldever develop into a self-supporting and powerful British Dominion, which is whatthe advocates of amalgamation claim as their objective. The new State might finditself before long in difficulties, which would compel the United Kingdom Govern-ment to assume responsibility, financial and administrative (as has happened,for other reasons, in the case of Newfoundland), or, more probably, it wouldgravitate into the Union of South Africa, which would thus be extended to the borders of Tanganyika.8. If amalgamation of the Bhodesias and Nyasaland as an immediatesolution is rejected, there will no doubt be a demand from some quarters in southern Rhodesia for the incorporation of Southern Rhodesia in the Union ofSouth Africa, since, although this suggestion was rejected by a referendum heldprior to the grant of responsible Government in 1923, the Southern Rhodesiansmight feel obliged to turn to the Union if they thought that their approach tothe North was definitely barred. This, however, does not seem to be a course which it would be desirable for His Majesty&apos;s Government to encourage. Thereare cogent arguments which have been urged for the view that the incorporation of Southern Rhodesia in the Union would adversely affect the interests both ofthe Europeans and natives in Southern Rhodesia as well as those of Northern
Ehodesia and Nyasaland and of the United Kingdom. These may be summarisedas follows :-(1) Southern Rhodesia as a whole would be involved in the racial strife ofthe white peoples of the Union and saddled with the Union problemsof the poor whites and-urbanised natives; the development of southern rhodesian secondary industries might be neglected and immigration from overseas closed.(2) African tenure of land now within the reserves and native areas ofSouthern Rhodesia might be menaced by politicians anxious to settlewhites on new farms. Moreover Southern Rhodesia would be unitingwith a country where racial tension is greater and outbreaks of publicviolence more frequent.(3) Great Britain might lose control over an important source of rawmaterials.(4) The spread of Union influence northwards would greatly strengthen those forces in Northern Rhodesia and also Nyasaland and the East African-   Territories which are opposed to His Majesty&apos;s Governments policyof political, economic and social advancement for the African popula-tions in partnership with the immigrant communities.9. It is therefore clearly desirable that strong efforts should be made toavoid the development of a straight choice between the amalgamation of SouthernRhodesia with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland on the one hand and its incor-poration as a fifth province in the Union on the other. We feel that our policy should be (1) to encourage the maintenance of Southern Rhodesia as aState independent of the Union and (2) while ruling out amalgamation at thisstage, to foster closer connection between it and its two Northern neighbours.It would certainly be most undesirable for His Majesty&apos;s Government to take up a purely negative attitude on the question of closer union in Central Africa.Such an attitude would indeed be inconsistent with the policy which led up tothe appointment of the Royal Commission in 1938, and the fact that considerationof the proposals of the Commission has been postponed since the beginning of thewar and that the Southern Rhodesia Government have refrained from embarras-sing us by demands for a decision makes it all the more desirable that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should be ready with a statement of such a nature as tomeet and as far as possible forestall such demands. Refusal to consider any form of closer connection would cause intense disappointment and dissatisfactionamong the European population of the two Rhodesias. In Northern Rhodesiait would almost certainly put an end to co-operation with the Government on thepart of the elected European representatives, thus impeding the development ofthe Territory as a whole and particularly the development of the native services.There is thus a strong case for an attempt to give effect to local aspirationsin so far as this can be done without departing from the general policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government regarding the development of tropical African territories.There is little doubt also that such an attempt would have a greater chance ofsuccess if it were initiated by His Majesty&apos;s Government.10. With this end in view we should be prepared with concrete proposals.The existing Inter-Territorial Conference should be strengthened and put on apermanent basis in the form of a standing Council. Its precise constitution and functions would be matters for discussion with the Governments concerned,subject to the understanding that it would only be an advisory and not an executive body. The Appendix contains the outline of a scheme which might beconsidered. In general, it should be the function of the Inter-TerritorialCouncil to promote the closest contact and co-operation between the three governments and their administrative and technical services, one form of whichwould be the loan of specialist officers from ,one Government to another when required. The present Inter-Territorial Secretariat, which was set up during thewar in order to assist in the co-ordination of the war effort of the three Territories,should be placed on a permanent basis. Apart from their political advantages,these measures would be of material benefit to the administration of the three territories.11. It must be admitted that it is doubtful whether a scheme of thiskind, limited to creating machinery for increased co-operation between the territories, would satisfy the views of the majority of the Europeans in southern and Northern Rhodesia.   In Northern Rhodesia it would be helpful
if an unofficial majority in the Legislative Council could be granted. in southern Rhodesia there has been some tendency lately to envisage as an ultimate step a form of federation of the States of Southern and central africa. It is clear that a federation, in the ordinary sense, of Territories inentirely different stages of constitutional development is not a practicable pro-position, especially as the position of neighbouring foreign countries inevitablyarises. The suggestion no doubt has its origin in the general conception ofregionalism which has been much discussed lately. The- Committee on Prepara-tions for the Meeting with the Dominion Prime Ministers is considering thepossibility of bringing before the meeting proposals as to consultative machinery in Colonial areas and, if it is decided to constitute such a body for Central and southern Africa, this might go a considerable distance to satisfy SouthernRhodesia.12. In conclusion, it may be added that it has recently been suggested that,if the amalgamation of Southern Rhodesia with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasa-land is rejected as an immediate solution, it would be of great help towardspreventing dissatisfaction in Southern Rhodesia if His Majesty&apos;s Governmentcould accord some advance of status to the Colony by its promotion in the councils of Empire, i.e., by admitting its representatives as full members and not merely as observers at Empire discussions. This is a matter which can be further explored and it should no doubt be possible to do something to help in thisdirection at least in regard to Conferences on economic or technical matters. Itdoes not appear that there is as yet any idea in Sir Godfrey Huggins&apos;s mind of full Dominion status or of a demand to control relations with foreign countriesor to appoint representatives abroad, and he seems rather to be thinking of theposition of Southern Rhodesia in relation to international economic policy. Weunderstand that the invitation extended to him to attend the forthcoming meetingof Prime Ministers when questions affecting Southern Rhodesia are under discus-sion has had a great effect as an indication that the work which he feels he has done in building up a Southern Rhodesia devoted to the British connection isappreciated in this country.O.&quot;  S.APPENDIX.1. The Council would consist of the Governor of Southern Rhodesia as chairman, the Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the PrimeMinister of Southern Rhodesia and one other member from, each Territory. Inthe case of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland the second member would beappointed for each session (not meeting) of the Council by the Governor andwould be one of the Governors principal advisers, i.e., either an official or an unofficial member of the Executive Council. It would, be made clear in any announcement that the unofficial leaders in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland would be closely associated with the work of the Council and its committees (seeParagraph 3 below).2. The function of the Council would be to discuss matters of common interest to the three Territories. These would include communications (road,rail and air), economic relations, industrial development, labour, education,agricultural, veterinary and medical matters, currency, research, and such othermatters as might be agreed between the three Governments.3. Permanent standing committees of the Council would be. set up to dealwith communications, industrial development, research and such other matters as might be agreed upon. In addition ad hoc conferences would be held under the ^aegis of the Council to deal with technical and special subjects. Unofficials from northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. would be included in the membership of thesestanding committees and would attend the ad hoc conferences.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTDISCUSSIONS WITH OFFICIALS OF THE DOMINIONS AND OFINDIA ON MONETARY AND ECONOMIC POLICY TO IMPLEMENTARTICLE VII OF THE MUTUAL AID AGREEMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.1. At their meeting on the 23rd February the War Cabinet endorsed theview of the Prime Minister that the report of the Committee on external economic Policy (W.P. (44) 121), and the instructions appended to it, shouldbe given to the United Kingdom officials who were taking part in the Article VIIdiscussions with Dominion and Indian representatives, as a general guide to thelines on.which the discussions should be conducted. During the course of the conversations, which have now ended, United Kingdom officials have acted upon these instructions, and have been at pains to make clear to Dominion and indian representatives that the War Cabinet has not yet reached conclusions on any ofthe topics under discussion.2. The broad upshot of the conversations between United Kingdom,Dominion and Indian officials is set out in the accompanying Agreed Summaryof Discussions (i.e., A.S.D. (44) 16). The whole of the ground covered by the talks between United Kingdom and United States officials in Washington last autumn was discussed, and, in addition, a new element was introduced byproposals of the Australian representatives for an International EmploymentAgreement.3. I would draw the attention of my colleagues in particular to paragraph 4of the Agreed Summary, which reads as follows : &apos;&apos; In the opinion of the officials concerned in these discussions, considera-tion of them at a technical official level has now reached a point at whichpositive guidance is required from Governments on the acceptability orotherwise of schemes on the lines proposed, and on the action to be taken.&quot;I share the view of the United Kingdom, Dominion and Indian officials on thispoint. In my opinion, the need for the War Cabinet to come to decisions on certain of the main points involved has become urgent, because post-war inter-national economic arrangements are certain to be raised by Dominion PrimeMinisters in the meetings which are due to begin shortly. Before the dominion prime Ministers leave for London, they will have received reports on the conversations that have recently ended, and I feel sure that they will be anxiousto learn whether the United Kingdom Government generally supports theconclusions reached as a result of three series of discussions between UnitedKingdom and Dominion officials in the last eighteen months. I appreciate, ofcourse, that it will not be possible or desirable for the War Cabinet to reach firmconclusions on questions of post-war international economic policy untilParliament has had an opportunity of making its views known. I feel, however,that the meetings with the Dominion Prime Ministers will afford the bestopportunity for examining, prior to Parliamentary debate, whether the general character and outline of the proposals under discussion are likely to be accept-able to Dominion Governments.Printed for the War Cabinet.
