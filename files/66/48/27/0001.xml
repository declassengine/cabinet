(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(*UO 177?Oth March,  19Uif COPYWAR CABINET.:RELIEF FOR OCCUPIED EUROPE[emorandum by the Minister of Economic WarfareI annex copies of an &quot;airgram&quot; handed to me yesterdayby Mr. Riefler instructing the American Embassy to seekour concurrence in a proposal to inform the swedish government immediately that the British and United states government are disposed to permit limited shipments ofspecial relief foodstuffs for children up to the age of1h. and nursing and expectant mothers in Belgium, France,the Netherlands and Norway, if the Swedish, Government will undertake to distribute the foodstuffs and can get theGerman Government to accept certain control stipulations0I understand that milk is the principal foodstuff whichthe Americans have in mind02. This question was last considered by the War Cabineton the 3nd Mays,    1943 (W.M. (i+3) 63rd Conclusions) v/hen theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs was invited to instruct HeM. Ambassador at Washington that our blockade policy was unchanged and that we wished to be taken fully into consultation before any commitments for relief wereentered into.3. I am advised that effective relief to the individuals and to the countries specified by the Americans(plus Poland, which would, in my view, have to be included)might eventually involve some 7*500,000 persons receivingabout 20,000 tons of dried milk and vitamins each month,though the Americans are probably not thinking of relief on anything like that scale at present,      I understandthat dried milk is already in very short supply,  though some vitamins are quite plentifulc     Distribution from.various continental ports would be exceedingly difficult in view of the probable effect of OVERLORD on railways.h. The present moment seems to me a singularlyunfavourable one for taking such action as that now suggested for the following reasons:-(a) It would be a psychological mistake to embark upon a limited relief programme with noexpectation of increasing its scope in thenear future, and with considerable doubt whether even the contemplated programme couldbe carried out.      It would be a great blunderto arouse expectations which we could not hope to fulfil.      This indeed might prove apolitical boomerang.
(b) Impending military events will probably for atime at least depress the standard of feedingin the occupied countries more than anylimited relief action could raise it.(c) Owing to the necessity of agreeing conditionswith our Allies., and obtaining the consentof the enemy, at least four months wouldprobably elapse before food could reachEurope under any relief scheme.      Thisbrings us to harvest time.(d) To agree to allow relief through the blockadeat this eleventh hour before the battle forthe liberation of Western Europe begins mightwell be regarded by those awaiting freedom,either with misgiving as to our militaryintentions, or with resentment as ameaningless gesture which will cost us nothingsince liberation will precede relief and because distribution will be impossiblewhilst operations last.5* In the penultimate paragraph of the Annex it issuggested that when the relief scheme has been communicatedto the German Government by the Swedish Government, theSoviet Government should be so informed.      I do not -thinkthat a mere notification to the Russians will suffice,because we cannot ignore the claims of Poland, and because Russia has surely the right to be consulted atsome stage before so important a matter is finally decided.6. It is probable that the American proposals are mainly prompted by considerations of internal politics,and that the supply and other considerations involvedhave not been thoroughly examined.      The proposals have,however,  the support of the President, and it would therefore hardly be possible to turn them down out of hand.      I suggest that our reply should deprecate thedespatch of instructions to Stockholm now, but should offer to embark upon an immediate discussion   of theproposals with a view to reaching full agreement as tothe policy to be pursued.7, I should add that the control stipulations whichthe Americans propose are theoretically impressive but inpractice unworkable.      They would in any case needconsiderable amplification.SoMinistry of Economic Warfare,Berkeley Square, W. 1.,30th March, 19hh,
ANNEXINCOMING AIRGRAMMarch 16, 1944STRICTLY CONFIDENTIALH        A-411        11:45 a.m.MEMBASSYLONDONFor the Ambassador and Riefler from Department and FEA.Please endeavor as soon as possible to obtain Britishconcurrence to the immediate transmission of a telegram tothe American Legations,  Stockholm, in the sense of the textquoted below.    Since Riefler is fully acquainted with the back-ground of this matter,  it is not considered necessary to setforth herein the considerations which seem to us to make this action advisable at this time from the political as well asthe humanitarian point of view.The President is fully in accord with this proposal.Riefler will note that the conditions as now proposeddiffer somewhat from those he saw when in Washington.    the changes resulted from the feeling that as originally drawnthey were so restrictive as to make their acceptance by theGermans impossible.    As our real objective is to put intooperation as soon as possible limited relief schemes in thefour countries named under such safeguards as are essentialtit has seemed necessary to modify the conditions so that theycan be put up to the Germans as a reasonable but firmproposal rather than merely as a basis for negotiation.QUOTE   United States and British Governments have noted with increasing satisfaction the excellent job done by theSwedish Government representatives in Greece in supervisingthe distribution among the Greek population of relief suppliessent to that country under the provisions of the relief schemewhich went into operation in the summer of 1942.    The UnitedStates and British Governments have not been unmindful of thesuffering in other territories under German control and of the expressed willingness of the Swedish Government to assume. responsibilities similar to those which it has assumed inconnection with the Greek relief scheme in effecting thedistribution of such supplies as may be permitted to pass through the blockade for distribution among distressedcivilian populations of other occupied areas.    Heretofore theAllied Governments have not considered it possible to permittthe shipment of relief supplies through the blockade into theother occupied areas without by so doing unduly giving aid tothe German war potential against the United Nations.    If theSwedish Government is willing to act as neutral guarantorof the programs and is able to obtain the agreement of theGerman Government to the following conditions, the AlliedGovernments are now disposed to permit limited shipments ofspecial relief foodstuffs for distribution to children up to theage of 14 and nursing and expectant mothers in Belgium, France,the Netherlands,  and Norway.    The programs may later be extendedelsewhere   if found practicable.i i-iL-
SUBQUOTE    (1) That imported relief foodstuffs endmedical supplies will be distributed strictly on the basisof need to children, nursing and expectant mothers, and such other special groups as may be designated, but not includingadults working or capable of working.(2) That the operation of the programs willbe under the complete and immediate control of a neutralcommission, the personnel of which must be approved by theGovernments of the United States and the United Kingdom, thecommission to be permitted to maintain an adequate staff andto have complete freedom of movement within the country inwhich it operates in order to supervise all aspects of theprogram&apos;s operation.(3) That Germany will agree to maintain the rations existing in the occui^ied country as of the date ofthis proposal, or not to reduce such rations unless thoseof civilians in Germany are reduced proportionately, end toincrease those rations in proportion to any.increase inrations in Germany or in other occupied territory.    those conditions require,  of course,  that sufficient supplies willbe made available from local production end German stocks for the rations to be met.    The supply of unrationed productsnormally consumed by the beneficiaries of the relief programsshall not be reduced by requisition,, exportation,  or diversion to others.    (It is recognised, however, that the ,supplymight be reduced by natural causes such as crop failure..)The neutral supervising commission in each country is to be accorded facilities to determine for itself v/hethor theseconditions are being met and is to be permitted from time totime to inform the Governments of the United States and theUnited Kingdom accordingly.(Ix) That all shipping required for the operationof the scheme will be neutral vessels presently within theblockaded area.    Fuel for these ships may, however, be furnished from Western Hemisphere sources at designatedpoints of origin.    END SUBQUOTE.German agreement to the setting up of relief programsunder necessary safeguards in the countries above mentionedwill probably be more readily given if the Swedish Governmenttakes the initiative in the matter.    You may assure theSwedish Government that no financial burden will fall uponthe latter by reason of its participation in this humanitarianwork either in connection with its supervisory activitieswithin the beneficiary countries or in connection with suchshipping as it may make available for the transportation of relief supplies.Please communicate to the Swedish Government the sense of the foregoing and ascertain whether that Government isdisposed to act as the neutral guarantor of such reliefprograms and is willing to approach the German Governmentwith a proposal incorporating the conditions set forth above.If the Swedish Government&apos;s reply is in the affirmativeyou may inform it that. the Governments of the United Statesand of the United Kingdom are agreeable to the immediatepresentation of such a proposal to. the German Government andwould appreciate being informed when the proposal has actually been submitted to the German Government.    UNQUOTE.When informed that a proposal in the foregoing sensehas been comaunicated to,the German Government by the Swedish
Government it is proposed that the Soviet Government be so informed and that the Governments of the United States andof the United Kingdom make an appropriate public statement.This message has been sent as a confidential airgrcrin order to avoid paraphrasing and re-paraphrasing the text of the proposed telegram to Stockholm.    Please replyin like manner.HULL
