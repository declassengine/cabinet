(ij-ii.) 182 COPY NO. 3 (g3rd April,  19jj4.W     -^-        /0 WAR CABINET /TEMPORARY EMBARGO ON BUTLDIift memorandum by the Minister of Production.1.      The transport situation demands that we should take allpossible steps to reduce the load to be carried during the peak of the operational period.      One substantial user is buildingmaterial where the total traffic (much of it short distanceand road borne) is of the order of 2 million tons a month.2.      Departmental building programmes are now governed by the.allocations of labour which were made at the beginning of theyear.      On March 6th Departments were asked to review theirbuilding programmes and see whether they could plan for a savingby April of 10 per cent on their transport demands for building materials over and above that yielded by adherence to existing programmes.     departments were also asked if they would particu-larly review their new projects in the light of the theory of maximum impact during 19hh since few of the projects coming forward within the next few months can yield substantial productiondividends this year.3.      Since that approach was made the matter has been discussed at the Ministerial Committee on Inland Transport and I have beenjgs     asked, in conjunction with the Ministry of Works and DepartmentsJ     concerned,   to explore the possibility of a cut greater than the10 per cent proposed.      I have discussed this with the Ministerof Works and our view is that the major contribution which canbe expected from reductions in the building programme would bemade by placing a temporary embargo on the starting of new/projects.     :!l
projects.      I propose, - therefore, that all. projects- which have notbeen started by the end of the present week should come under thisembargo,  and that I should raise the question of continuance atthe end of April,  though I should not expect much relaxation by    -then.h.      Partial embargoes have recently been placed on certain areas -Southampton and the Thames Estuary - and in December,  191+2 a com-/plete embargo was enforced for a period in order to balance thebuilding programme..5.      In the general application of an embargo I would not proposeto include maintenance work or small works of less than  5,000(i.e.   25 men for three to four months).      There can, however, beno question that operational works which would be ready in timefor the forthcoming operations must be allowed to proceed andcertain other projects may have to &quot;be permitted.6.      But in granting exceptions we should not be able to agree thatthe mere fact that a particular demand on transport was smallwould in itself be a sufficient reason for exemption.      Those long-term building schemes which are now due to start will be unlikely to contribute much to this year&apos; s effort,  and we are still boundto regard the maximum impact in 19hh as the main objective in ourplanning.7.      The labour released will be used for transport and otherurgent operational needs and for essential housing repairs.      TheMinister of Labour will arrange that the labour directed out ofthe building industry can be returned later to that industry.8.      I ask my colleagues to agree that an embargo should be imposed on new building in the above terms.      This should operatefrom the end of the present week and should be subject to review at the end of this  month.      I further ask that decisions onclaims for exemption by Departments from this embargo should be/made
I made by me as Minister of Production.      The machinery for handling such cases should continue (as at present) to be theMinistry of Works acting on my &quot;behalf.      But I should be happy to consult with my colleagues on any special procedure that( y prove to be required to adjudicate upon claims for exemptiono;^grounds of operational importance.0.- L.t.
