THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 170.23rd March, 1944.WAR CABINET.POLICY TOWARDS SPAIN.Memorandum by the Secretary of.State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a note onour Spanish policy.A, E.Foreign Office, 23rd March, 1944.ANNEX.Until the late autumn of 1943 it had appeared that the policy of theSpanish Government was evolving satisfactorily from the Allied point of view.The Spanish Government were more strictly observing the requirements of neutrality and were slowly putting an end to illicit German activities. our economic relations with Spain were also developing satisfactorily. Then therecame a period when it seemed that this favourable trend was reversed and we accordingly consulted the United States Government as to what action we could take to improve the position.The main requirements of His Majesty&apos;s Government were the finalliquidation of the Spanish Blue Division in Russia, the suppression of Germanespionage and sabotage activities in Spain, the closure of the German Consulate-General at Tangier, whose re-establishment the Spanish Government hadillegally permitted in 1941, the release of fourteen Italian merchant ships in spanish ports, and a reduction of wolfram exports to Germany. The UnitedStates Government agreed that these were all important requirements butattached most importance to the suppression of Spanish wolfram exports toGermany, on which they were anxious to secure a complete embargo. It was accordingly agreed that Sir Samuel Hoare should see General Franco and leavehim in no doubt as to the importance we attached to the settlement of ourgrievances and to the suppression of Spanish wolfram exports to Germany.My colleagues will have seen the instructions sent to Sir Samuel Hoarein despatch No. 442 of the 20th December which was circulated to the WarCabinet. In Januajry oil shipments to Spain from United Nations sourceswere suspended as a means of showing the Spanish Government how dissatisfiedwe were with Spanish policy.In the subsequent negotiations, it soon became clear that the SpanishGovernment were prepared to give us complete satisfaction on the matters towhich His Majesty&apos;s Government attached chief Importance, but that therewould be great difficulty in securing a total embargo on Spanish wolframexports to Germany.It is on this last point that the negotiations have principally centred overthe last two months. I will not recount the details of the negotiations but,briefly, the position now is that the Spanish Government have refused to imposean embargo or even to agree to a reduction of exports to Germany to 10 percent, of the total Spanish output of wolfram during 1943. This latterproposal, which the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs had tentativelysuggested himself, would in effect mean an embargo for the rest of the present12317   [27142]Copy No.
year, since the Germans have already had 300 tons of Spanish wolfram, whichis equal to 10 per cent, of Spain&apos;s 1943 output. The chief difficulty refers to afurther 200 tons of wolfram which the Spanish Government seem to have promised to the Germans. The United States Government continue to insist on a completeembargo for the rest of the year and are at present not willing to consider liftingthe oil embargo until this is achieved.The problem is essentially a short-term one pending the establishment of theSecond Front. We can of course intensify economic sanctions and eventuallybring Spain to heel. But the Spaniards have a considerable capacity for tighten-ing their belts in resistance to foreign pressure. They would be unlikely to give way for some months and could meanwhile do us much harm. In my view, itwould not be unreasonable to allow the Spaniards to export the 200 tons inquestion provided they were spread out over the whole year. I am influenced bythe facts (1) that the Germans have in warehouses in northern Spain already some700 tons, which will be at once exported if no agreement is reached; (2) that failure to reach agreement on the wolfram question will prevent or indefinitelydelay the satisfaction of our other requirements, such as the suppression ofGerman sabotage and espionage activities, &amp;c, to which I have referred above;(3) that the only alternative to a settlement is further economic sanctions whichwould lead to the stoppage of such very important imports from Spain as iron ore and potash, the second of which, I understand, is essential to our agriculture.Both could only with great difficulty be replaced from other sources. Finally, the breakdown of economic relations would deprive us of all our financial resources in spain and leave the Germans a free hand in the Spanish economic field, whichwould be a sorry end to a not unsuccessful Anglo-American economic policy in thelast few years.In these circumstances I am pressing the United States Government to agreeto a reasonable compromise proposal on the lines set out in my telegram No. 2336to Washington, which has been circulated to the War Cabinet.
