(44) 37th Conclusions) with a view to its considerationby the War Cabinet.L.Ministry of War Transport, W. 1,5th April, 1944.REPORT BY THE MINISTERIAL OIL COMMITTEE.1. Following the conclusions of the War Cabinet at their Meeting on the21st March, 1944 (W.M. (44) 37th Conclusions) we were appointed by the PrimeMinister on the 28th March to consider in the first place the terms of theinstructions to the official United Kingdom delegation to Washington for theforthcoming discussions on oil.2. The Committee decided that the delegation should consist (in addition toSir William Brown, nominated by the War Cabinet as Chairman) of : A representative of the Petroleum Division.A representative of the Foreign Office.A representative of the Admiralty (who by agreement with the other service Departments will represent the three Service Departments).A representative of the Treasury.Sir William Fraser.Sir Frederick Godber.The last two form in our view an essential element, having regard to the range of their knowledge of the production, refining and distribution of oilthroughout the world, and of their experience of negotiation of such questions.A genda for the Discussion.3. The United States have suggested as a tentative list of subjects fordiscussion the following :  (1) Interests of  producing and  consuming  countries  in  Middle Eastpetroleum.[27209]
(2) The quantity of Middle East oil that should flow into post-war world markets.(3) Existing impediments to proposed production.(4) Transport problems.(5) Concession rights.(6) Price and marketing policies.We suggest that the delegation should accept the suggested agenda as ensuring that the United States delegation should have to open the discussion and expoundtheir views on each item in turn.4. It appears probable that the United States delegation will be unable inthe first instance to put forward concrete proposals. The various United StatesGovernment agencies and interests concerned are not likely readily to come to agreement. It will be for the United Kingdom delegation to explore this positionand to assess the strength and importance of the various American motives.5. We append a draft of the instructions which we recommend should begiven to the official delegation.Instructions to Delegation.6. Item 1 of the draft instructions. This sets out the general objective of the delegation.Item 2. This excludes from the discussion possible American suggestionsaffecting Lend/Lease.Item 3.   This ensures that the discussions must be world-wide.Item 4. It is to the interest of both countries that there should not bedisorderly and wasteful production of oil and the consequent derangement of markets.Item 5. This suggests general principles which may emerge from thediscussions, and which might, in our judgment, in that event deserve furtherconsideration by Ministers.There are two points to which we would in particular invite the attentionof the Cabinet: (a) sub-paragraph iii of Item 5, which runs, &quot; Each Government will take all proper action to ensure that the terms of such concessions areobserved by the parties to the concession.&quot; &apos;(b) sub-paragraph v of Item 5, which runs, &apos;&apos; Each Government will do allin its power (e.g., by the use of pre-emptive rights) to ensure pilsupplies to the other if the other is at war.&quot;Of these, the first, if adopted, would commit the United States Governmentto stronger support of concessionaires than they have shown in the Mexicancontroversy.The second is possibly more important still. We have not yet seen thereport of the Chiefs of Staff, but we understand that they consider the bestassurance of supplies in a time of war to lie in active British oil enterprises,with oil reserves, particularly,&apos; of course, in areas easily accessible to us andmost easily protected by our armed forces. The suggested expansion of theresources available to us and of those available to the U.S.A. would be of real value from this point of view.7. The instructions do not, of course, cover every contingency. They donot deal, for -example, with matters such as oil installations, or the Saudi-Arabian pipeline controversy, which may^ be raised from the United States side.As regards the first of these, the delegation could only take note of what mightbe raised by the United States delegation, and include it in their report to ministers. As regards the Saudi-Arabian pipeline, our delegation, if the matter is raised, should bring out the practical difficulties we see, and should urge thatthe time is not yet ripe for consideration of such a project, which can make no contribution to the war effort, and which would indeed be a hindrance to it ifits provision and shipment were proceeded with before the conclusion of the war.8.   We commend these draft instructions to the Cabinet.j.
APPENDIX.Instructions to the Official Oil Delegation.(1) The general object of the delegation should be to explore possible bases of an Anglo-American agreement on oil policy for consideration by Ministers.(2) The delegation should make no commitments and, in particular, willrefuse to consider any proposals involving existing rights or properties in oil, orthe transfer of oil products without payment.(3) The delegation should endeavour to reach agreement with the UnitedStates delegation on the facts of the world oil situation. They should maintainthe position that there is no present or immediately prospective shortage of oil in the Middle East or in the world generally. They should direct the discussiontowards the world position and not only to the Middle East.(4) On the basis that oil resources are at present ample, the delegation should explore any possible machinery whereby these resources can be devolped in an orderly manner, always provided that no machinery can be consideredwhich would prevent the development of British-controlled resources to thefullest extent necessary to maintain first the communications and the military security of the British Empire, and secondly, the maintenance not only of theindustrial capacity of the United Kingdom, but also the general commercialposition of the United Kingdom and the foreign exchange thereby obtained.The delegation should discuss in this connection the amount of information which each Government may be able to furnish to the other for these purposes.(5) The delegation should be prepared to lead these discussions (withouttabling any proposals) towards the subsequent consideration by Ministers ofan agreement in general terms laying down principles to be observed reciprocallyby the two Governments including any or all of the following : (i) Each country requires the assurance of adequate oil supplies for national security and for the maintenance of its industrial and com-mercial life.(ii) Neither country will support enterprises conducted by its nationalsdirected towards the securing of such supplies unless (a) such enterprises are conducted by persons enjoying the confidence of their respective Governments;(b) full information is given to each Government by its own nationals of the terms of any concessions;(c) these terms are. such as to safeguard and promote not only thenecessary interests of the Government concerned but also theproper interests of the Government granting the concessionand the needs of consuming countries;(d) the terms make possible the orderly expansion of productionhaving regard to the interests both of producing and of con-suming countries.(iii) Each Government will take all proper action to ensure that the termsof such concessions are observed by the parties to the concession.(iv) Neither Government will afford support to concessions which arediscriminatory against the other Government,(v) Each Government will do all in its power (e.g., by the use of pre-emptive rights) to ensure oil supplies to the other if the other isat war.
