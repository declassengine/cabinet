Printed for the &quot;War Cabinet.   April 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 193.7th April, 1944.WAR CABINET.THE INDIAN REPRESENTATIVES AT THE WAR CABINET.Note by the Prime Minister.WE may shortly expect the arrival of His Highness the Maharaja of Kashmirand the Honourable Sir Firoz Khan Noon, representatives of India at the WarCabinet. I know my colleagues will be anxious to show them just as muchcourtesy and consideration as was shown to their predecessors, and to treat themin every possible way as Dominion representatives.I feel it necessary, however, to repeat the warning I previously issued.Though, as before, I shall invite them to attend our Monday Meetings on geueralwar affairs, it must not be assumed that I shall feel able to invite them to Meetingswhen Indian affairs are to be discussed. I suggest we should bear this point inmind in any personal conversations we may have with the Maharaja and Sir FirozKhan, and avoid giving them the impression that they have a right to attend all war Cabinet Meetings, or necessarily to be present when Indian matters are under discussion.It will, of course, follow that they will not receive all papers circulated toWar Cabinet Ministers. No doubt my colleagues will bear this also in mind. Anote is annexed indicating the classes of papers which they will receive.W. S. C.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,7th April, 1944.27215
