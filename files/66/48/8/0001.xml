MOST SECRETSUPPLY OP POWER FOR INDUSTRIAL PURPOSES IN SOUTH wales and SOUTH WEST ENGLANDMemorandum by the Minister of Production on thesituation created by the stoppage in the South WalesCoalfield.1-.     On 9th. March -we were informed that as from 13th March a drastic cut in the supply of electric power would have to be imposed on industrial usersin the South Wales and South Western Regions. .2.     An examination of the position on the spot in consultation with thelocal representatives of the Ministry of Fuel and Power and central electricity Board revealed the following situation:-&quot;(a) Unless remedial measures&quot;not then assured could be applied,the load would have to be reduced by an aggregate of 250,000 kw.and the Central Electricity Board required to know by Mondayhow that reduction could be apportioned with the least possibledislocation to essential production.(b) The normal load in these two Regions is, roughly, as follows:-South Wales - South WesternIndustrial 350,000 kw. 180,000 kw.Other (predominantlydomestic) 150,000 kw. 150,000 kw. &apos;Total 500,000 kw. , 330,000 lew.(c)   The reason why a substantial cut in supply appeared unavoidablewas the non-availability of coal in sufficient quantitiesat most of the large generating stations.       Over aconsiderable period consumption of coal had exceeded supply ,with the result that when the flow of fresh supplies dried . .up owing to the stoppage, the coal remaining at the stationswas the less accessible part of the stockpile and limitations of handling capacity-prevented generating at more than a portion of normal output.    (The position varied at differentstations but. the net result was. that,unless further suppliesof coal could be brought in, the supply would fall by the250,000 kw. already mentioned - and this after taking credit for. all the current that could be made available from other areas.)3*     The following decisions were therefore taken on 10th March:-(a)   To accelerate by every means possible measures to bring intoNuse at the generating stations all available supplies of suitablecoal in the Regions.     (This included some opencast coalof, which the production had been substantially increasedwhen the emergency arose..).(b) . To reinforce the efforts to secure suitable coal from other regions.(c)   To treat the South Wa4-es and South Western Regions, as one forthis purpose and plan the unavoidable reduction in use so asto minimise the. interference&apos; with production,
4.     In eaoh Region these measures were- pursue3rtey^feH^.^^o*^of all Departments concerned in consultation as far as possible with Haad-quarters.       &quot; And I would like at this point to acknowledge gratefully .the readiness with which the Supply Departments delegated authority to tfeeirlocal Controllers thereby facilitating prompt and effective local actionin co-operation with the Regional Controllers of-the Ministry of Production.5.     The industrial position in these two Regions differs considerably.In South Wales by far the greater part of the load is taken by some50 or 60 firms.      In the South Western Region the 400 largest users takeless than half the load.     When, therefore, it came to applying the necessarycuts in consumption a different technique had to be adopted for each Region.6.     By mid-day on 11th March the measures taken by Ministry of Fuel and power in co-operation with the Ministry of War Transport and the otherDepartments had imp roved the situation to such an extent that (a) the cut in supply could be deferred until the 14-th March (thereby giving a littlemore time for planning the cuts in industrial consumption in consultationwith representatives of industry) and (b) the essential minimum cut had comedown to 60,000 kw,        This 60,000 kw. was apportioned as to 40*000 kw. &apos;in South Y/ales and 20,000 kw. in the South Western Region.     Because,however, stocks had dropped to such a low level and because for a few days after resumption of work in the coalfields an increase in load must arise -due to the resumption of supply of power to the collieries (who are themselveslarge users) before the newly rained coal can reach the generating stations -it was clear that some margin of safety was desirable in our planning andalso that the cut in consumption would have to be imposed even if theminers returned to work at the beginning of this week.7*    ,Meetings with representatives of Industry and the interested departments were held in Cardiff and Bristol on the afternoon of the 11th with the resultthat(a) In South Wales a reduction in Industrial load of 53*000 kw.has been arranged by agreement of all concerned.       This isapportioned between 42 undertakings of whom 30 are in theIron and Steel Group.(b) In the South Western Region an &quot;Economy of use&apos; will been forced amounting to 15^ of their average consumption     -   -during the four weeks ended 4th March 1944.     This will apply&apos;to all firms using an appreciable amount of electric power - probably embracing undertakings using 30 kw. ormore.       This will be applied as to some 2,000 of the largerfirms by direct message, from the Regional Headquarters,using the Emergency Services Organisation and ( 24 hourslater) to the others through the Electricity Supply Stations.Arrangements have been made for authority vested in the Minister of fuel and Power &apos;under the Defence Regulations to be delegated to theMinistry of Production Regional Controllers to enforcs these cuts.It has also been arranged that special exemption will be given to workoh products of particular urgency in connection with forthcoming operations.8.      Subject to the concurrence of my colleagues these measures will be putinto force immediately after this Meeting.9.     I am hopeful that by these measures the enforced economy in use ofelectric power will reduce the effect upon essential war production to theminimum.       It would not be surprising, for example, if some reduction inovertime could be sustained without a corresponding reduction in output..10. It is unlikely that in the South Western Region any question of dischargeor &apos; laying off workpeople will arise.      It may, however, arise in South
Wales.      An undertaking operating under the Essential Works Order isobliged to pay wages to employees *laid-off*.       It seems right that inthese circumstances such payments should be recoverable.       There may,however, be a few firms where, discharges are inevitable but the necessityof obtaining prior approval from the National Service Officer coupled with the obvious difficulty of recovering labour once lost should keepthese discharges to the minimum^ , -11.    It is impossible, I understand, to determine at this moment the maximumduration of these cuts, but for reasons already mentioned they must operatefor a week.       It is on the basis that the load will be reduced by 60,000 kw.for a week from mid-day tomorrow that agreement   has been reached,  and it remains to be seen when, and to what extent, alleviation can be given.The events of the past week have proved how small is the margin of safety and what serious results may flow from a temporary interruption in .the supplyof coal.       The local representative of the Central Electricity Board statedcategorically that unless a radical improvement had been effected in suppliesof coal to the generating stations in these two Regions the position.withwhich we were faced last Saturday would have had to be faced in four weekstime if there had been no stoppage in the Yfelsh Coalfield.I propose that a survey should be made forthwith of other Regions inorder to determine the supply positions in relation to (a) industrial and(b) domestic load so that from the production angle the best possible plansmay be made to safeguard the position in advance of a crisis.12.    Since the immediate reduction in supply of electric power in these twoRegions affects a large number of vrorkpeople and those affected must beinformed today it is,  I think, desirable that a short official statement should be issued to the Press.13*    It would also seem desirable to consider whether some cut should bemade in &quot;domestic&quot; consumption of electricity.       In this context &quot;domestic&quot;includes shop lighting, places of entertainment etc. And although it isnot practicable to reduce supplies to private persons without the risk ofcurtailing current  consumed by   hospitals and other esse;confidential  public services a strongly worded direction from the    Government would no doubtensure a large measure of compliance.     Any such direction would cover thepoint that the reduction in electricity must not be offset by increased consumption of coal or gas.       To the extent that domestic consumption is reduced the sooner will it be possible to mitigate the cut on supply for industrial purposes. t14*.   I am informed that the situation as regards coal and gas for industrial^purposes in these two Regions is as follows:-Coal(a) South Wales.     A number of large industrial users have already had to reduce production substantially, but within two or three days of resumption of work in the mines, this will begin toright itself.(b) South Western.     The position is relatively good.     The averagestock of the larger users is 5/6 weeks at normal consumption. -Gas(a) South Wales.   . The position is precarious but no production hasbeen lost so far through lack of supply.(b) South Western.     The position is not critical.       The averagestock in the hands of gas companies is three weeks at fulloutput.
- \15*   To summarize(a) I propose that the measures described in paragraph 7 be putinto force.immediately;v(b) I ask for confirmation that wage payments to employeestemporarily &quot;laid-off&quot; as a direct result of the cutsimposed are recoverable- from the Supply department concerned through the appropriate machinery.      (Para 10);(c) I propose in collaboration with the Minister of Fuel and power to formulate plans for dealing with similar emergenciesin other Regions (para 11);(d) I propose that a short statement on the situation as affectingproduction in South Wales and the South Y/estern Region beissued to the Press.     (Para. 12);(e) I ask that means to secure a reduction in 1 domestic&apos; consumptionof electricity, in these two Regions at least, be considered..(Para. 13).(intld.)     O.L.13th March, 1944.
