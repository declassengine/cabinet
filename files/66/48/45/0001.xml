E.Foreign Office, 6th April, 1944.ANNEX.Translation of a Letter dated- 5th April, 1944, from M. Vienot to the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs.Mr. Secretary of State,With reference to our recent conversation, I take the liberty of sendingyou herewith the text of an extract from the speech delivered by General de Gaulleyesterday at Algiers. It bears on a matter about which you expressed some anxiety and, your views on which I/duly conveyed to General de Gaulle.General de Gaulle&apos;s line of thought corresponds with the view which thePrime Minister expressed some weeks ago at Marrakesh and again yesterday inthe course of the interview which he did me the honour of granting.In drawing a distinction, for the purposes of the necessary repressivemeasures, between the handful of traitors, who will be punished, and the weakor blind, upon whom the appropriate penalties will be inflicted, and in followingthis with an appeal for the union of all against the common enemy, the Presidentof the French Committee of National Liberation gave expression, as you know,to the determination of all Frenchmen.Please accept, &amp;c.&apos;P. VIENOT.Extract from Speech by General de Gaulle at Algiers on Tuesday, 4th April, 1944.A few traitors may have given direct assistance to the enemy. They are receiving, or will receive, the punishment they deserve. A few craven or blindindividuals may, cheerfully and of their own free will, have made their own thepolicy of collaboration pursued by unworthy leaders; their weakness and theirblindness are being or will be penalised. The nation is determined to deal justlywith their absurd intrigues. But the immense majority of Frenchmen, whatever their opinions may have been in the days of darkness or even their mistakes so understandable in the present terrible upheaval consist only of our haplessbrothers who must only be treated as fighters united to save the mother country,which belongs to them all.12333   [27236]
