THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  March 1944.SECRET. / Copy No.W.R (44) 156. /.10th March, 1944. IWAR CABINET.    PvfIRELAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I circulate for the information of the War Cabinet the text, which I have just received, of Mr. de Valera&apos;s reply to our recent approach to him.C.Dominions Office,10th March, 1944.LETTER FROM Mr. de VALERA TO SIR JOHN MAFFEY covering a COPY OF THE EIRE GOVERNMENTS REPLY TO THE UNITEDSTATES GOVERNMENTS NOTE OF 21st FEBRUARY.Department of External Affairs,Excellency, Dublin, 8th March, 1944.I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the Note of the BritishGovernment handed to me by you on the 22nd February welcoming the initiativetaken by the American Government in their Note of the 21st February. I enclose,for transmission to your Government, a copy of the reply which was handed tothe Department of State by the Irish Minister at Washington on the 7th March.Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurance of my highest consideration.(Signed) EAMON de VALERA.THE Note of the American Government was handed to me by the AmericanMinister on the 21st February. I informed him at once that the request it contained was one with which it was impossible for the Irish Government tocomply. The Irish Government have since given the matter careful consideration,and I now confirm the reply which I then gave verbally.The Irish Government have also received the assurance of the AmericanGovernment conveyed to the Irish Minister at Washington, and later confirmed by the American Minister here in an interview with me on the 29th February,to the effect that the American Government did not contemplate proceeding to military or other measures because of the reply which had been given. TheAmerican Minister quoted in particular the Presidents personal message to meof the 26th February, 1942, that &quot; there is not now, nor was there then, the first-thought or intention of invading the territory of Ireland or of threatening thesecurity of the Irish,&quot; and added that this attitude was unchanged.The Irish Government wish to express their appreciation of this assurance.They were, indeed, surprised that so grave a Note as that of the 21st Februaryshould have been addressed to them. The terms of the Note seemed to themaltogether out of harmony with the facts and with the traditional relations of friendship between the Irish and American peoples. They doubted that such aNote could have been presented had the American Government been fully aware of the uniformly friendly character of Irish neutrality in relation to the UnitedStates and of the measures which had been taken by the Irish Government, withinthe limits of their power, to safeguard American interests.   They felt, moreover,[27084]
that the American Government should have realised that the removal of therepresentatives of a foreign State on the demand of the Government to which theyare accredited is universally recognised as a first step towards war, and that theIrish Government could not entertain the American proposal without a completebetrayal of their democratic trust. Irish neutrality represents the united will of people and Parliament. It is the logical consequence of Irish history and of theforced partition of the national territory.Already, before America&apos;s entry into the war, the policy of the IrishGovernment towards Britain, America&apos;s Ally, had been directed towardscarrying out the intention indicated in a statement of policy made by me in DailEireann on the 29th May, 1935, namely, that &quot;our territory would never be permitted to be used as a base for attack upon Britain.&quot; That policy has duringthe war been faithfully pursued. From the beginning, by the establishmentof strong observation and defence forces, by a wide and rigorous censorship ofthe Press and of communications, by an extensive anti-espionage organisation,and by every other means within our power, we have endeavoured to prevent theleakage through Ireland of any information which might in any way endangerBritish lives or the safety of Great Britain. Since the United States entered the war, the same spirit of scrupulous regard for American interests has been shown. American officials have had an opportunity of seeing the measureswhich have been taken taken &apos;they have, indeed, made favourable comments ontheir effectiveness and it is satisfactory to observe that in the Note itself nota single instance of neglect is alleged and no proof of injury to american interests adduced. Should American lives be lost, it will not be through anyindifference or neglect of its duty on the part of this State.As was known to the American officials, it is true that the German minister had a wireless transmitter. But he had been for a long time debarred from using it, and it has been in the custody of the Irish Government for some months.As regarpls the two parachutists dropped in Ireland last December, they wereapprehended within a few hours. Two other agents dropped here since the warbegan met with a similar fate. The fifth, who arrived during the first year ofthe war, remained at large until the 3rd December, 1941, but the police were aware of his presence here almost from the first moment of landing, and successful activities on his part were rendered impossible. The total number ofpersons, inclusive of these parachutists, suspected of intention to engage inespionage, and now held in Irish prisons, is ten foreign and two Irish nationals.These are the facts, and it is doubtful if any other country can show such a record of care and successful vigilance.The British Government have informed the Irish Government that theywelcomed the initiative of the American Government in sending the Note, andthat they attached the utmost importance to it. The Irish Government do not wish to comment upon this, except to remark that it is perhaps not known tothe American Government that the feelings of the Irish people towards Britainhave, during the war, undergone a considerable change precisely because britain has not attempted to violate our neutrality. The Irish Government feel sure that the American Government would agree that it would be regrettable if anyincidents now should alter that happy result.The Irish Government are therefore safeguarding, and will continue tosafeguard, the interests of the United States, but they must, in all circumstances,protect the neutrality of the Irish State and the democratic way of life of theIrish people. Their attitude will continue to be determined not by fear, of any measures which could be employed against them, but by goodwill and thefundamental friendship existing between the two peoples.
