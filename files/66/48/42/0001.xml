THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS britannic MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1944.22 3SECRET.W.P. (44) 192.Qth April, 1944.Copy -No.war CABINET.DISCUSSIONS WITH OFFICIALS OF THE DOMINIONS AND OFINDIA ON MONETARY AND ECONOMIC POLICY TO IMPLEMENTARTICLE VII OF THE MUTUAL AID AGREEMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.1. At their meeting on the 23rd February the War Cabinet endorsed theview of the Prime Minister that the report of the Committee on external economic Policy (W.P. (44) 121), and the instructions appended to it, shouldbe given to the United Kingdom officials who were taking part in the Article VIIdiscussions with Dominion and Indian representatives, as a general guide to thelines on.which the discussions should be conducted. During the course of the conversations, which have now ended, United Kingdom officials have acted upon these instructions, and have been at pains to make clear to Dominion and indian representatives that the War Cabinet has not yet reached conclusions on any ofthe topics under discussion.2. The broad upshot of the conversations between United Kingdom,Dominion and Indian officials is set out in the accompanying Agreed Summaryof Discussions (i.e., A.S.D. (44) 16). The whole of the ground covered by the talks between United Kingdom and United States officials in Washington last autumn was discussed, and, in addition, a new element was introduced byproposals of the Australian representatives for an International EmploymentAgreement.3. I would draw the attention of my colleagues in particular to paragraph 4of the Agreed Summary, which reads as follows : &apos;&apos; In the opinion of the officials concerned in these discussions, considera-tion of them at a technical official level has now reached a point at whichpositive guidance is required from Governments on the acceptability orotherwise of schemes on the lines proposed, and on the action to be taken.&quot;I share the view of the United Kingdom, Dominion and Indian officials on thispoint. In my opinion, the need for the War Cabinet to come to decisions on certain of the main points involved has become urgent, because post-war inter-national economic arrangements are certain to be raised by Dominion PrimeMinisters in the meetings which are due to begin shortly. Before the dominion prime Ministers leave for London, they will have received reports on the conversations that have recently ended, and I feel sure that they will be anxiousto learn whether the United Kingdom Government generally supports theconclusions reached as a result of three series of discussions between UnitedKingdom and Dominion officials in the last eighteen months. I appreciate, ofcourse, that it will not be possible or desirable for the War Cabinet to reach firmconclusions on questions of post-war international economic policy untilParliament has had an opportunity of making its views known. I feel, however,that the meetings with the Dominion Prime Ministers will afford the bestopportunity for examining, prior to Parliamentary debate, whether the general character and outline of the proposals under discussion are likely to be accept-able to Dominion Governments.[27231]
4. I therefore urge that, within the next few weeJss, the War cabinet should consider whether it is prepared to accept the broad lines of the proposals that have emerged from the series of discussions between United Kingdom,Dominion, Indian and United States officials, so that the United KingdomGovernment may be in a position, before submission to Parliament takes place,to give a preliminary indication of its views to Dominion Prime Ministers andto ascertain the attitude likely to be adopted by their Governments.C.Dominions Office, Qth April, 1944.

INTRODUCTION.1. The discussions which have taken place in London between United.Kingdom, Dominion and Indian officials from the 23rd February to the21st March, 1944, have covered I. Monetary policy (including international investment).II. Commercial policy.III. Commodity policy.IV. Cartel policy.V.-Employment.The broad upshot of the discussions on these subjects is summarised below.2. Previous discussions between representatives of Commonwealth Govern-ments on these matters in 1942 and June 1943 have covered only monetary andcommodity policy and commercial policy respectively. The discussion in thepresent series of talks of all five subjects (or six if international investment is included separately) has brought into prominence the close interdependencebetween them. It has been emphasised at many points in the discussion that the readiness of Governments to associate themselves with one of the other arrange-ments proposed might depend very largely upon whether the other arrangementsdiscussed were accepted internationally. The officials participating in these discussions feel, therefore, that in future consideration of these matters by or between Governments attention should be paid to the relationship between them.3. The six subjects referred to above were all discussed in the informal talks between United Kingdom and United States officials. A new element has,however, been introduced by the proposal made by representatives of australia for an International Employment Agreement (see Section VI below).4. In the opinion of the officials concerned in these discussions, considera-tion of them at a technical official level has now reached a point at which positiveguidance is required from Governments on the acceptability or otherwise ofschemes on the lines proposed, and on the action to be taken.I.-MONETARY POLICY (INCLUDING INTERNATIONALINVESTMENT).5. The Committee has held eight meetings, at which the text of theStatement of Principles for the establishment of an International Monetary Fund(Annex A) has been under close examination, a special meeting to examine theAmerican proposals for a United Nations Bank for Reconstruction and Develop-ment,* and two joint meetings with the Committee on Commercial Policy, atwhich the mutual problems of the Transitional Period were discussed.6. In the field of international monetary co-operation through the instrument of international institutions, the Committee agree that two institu-tions are necessary, one for assisting countries in their financial transactions on current account, and another for assisting countries by the provision of long-termmoney for development.For the immediate difficulties of some countries whose economy will havebeen seriously damaged by the war, there will, in addition, be need of financialassistance for reconstruction and rehabilitation. The Committee agree that theInternational Monetary Fund is not designed to provide money for reconstruc-tion or to deal with abnormal war-time indebtedness. If an internationalinstitution for long-term investment comes into being before the end of the war,it is possible that it could assist in the provision of finance for reconstruction.But the Committee wish to emphasise that at present, in the various plans for economic co-operation after the war, there is a gap to be filled in respect offinancial help to those countries which will need money for reconstruction andpossess either no liquid resources or resources obviously inadequate for such a purpose. Similarly, while the Statement makes it clear that the problems of abnormal war indebtedness lie outside the scope of the Fund and that in its constitution a line is drawn between current transactions and those of theprevious period, it is important that all available means for bridging this gapshould be pursued so that the multilateral convertibility of sterling may be* A.S.D. (44) 8./
achieved to the largest practicable extent as early as possible. The committee see no reason to expect that the long-term objectives of the proposals would be detrimental to the maintenance and strengthening of the relations between thecountries forming the sterling area. Meanwhile, the problems of war-timeindebtedness must be discussed and settled between the countries concerned.International Monetary Fund.7. In the light of the general views stated in the previous paragraph, theCommittee have examined the Statement of Principles resulting from theWashington discussions. This examination led the Committee to propose certain amendments which are set out in Annex B, and a revised table of quotas which forms Annex C; and, subject to the reservations of some delegations as indicatedin the Annexes, it was agreed that the amendments should be urged upon theUnited States Departments and that their attention should be called to the reservations. As the Committee were in the position of discussing a detaileddocument, they have not thought it necessary in this document to set out at lengththe general considerations or differences of view which were expressed and fully discussed during the meetings.8. The Committee desire to place on record their unanimous preference for the monetised Unitas version of the Statement of Principles, which hasmany advantages over the non-Unitas version. But they also record their viewthat, from the technical aspect, the Unitas version is not essential to the satisfactory working of the scheme, and that the acceptance by the United states treasury of the Unitas version could not be pressed as a condition of the acceptability of the scheme as a whole.9. Subject to the acceptance by the United States Departments of theproposed amendments and to the reservations indicated in Annexes B and C,the Committee agree that, from the technical aspect, the revised Statement of principles is a satisfactory foundation for discussion at a wider internationalmeeting. The Committee took note of the right of a country to impose restric-tions on imports on balance of payments grounds on the conditions proposedby the Committee on Commercial Policy, and they affirm the importance of this right in relation to the obligations of member countries of the Monetary Fund.Transitional Period and the Sterling Area arrangements.10. The Committee had a full discussion on Clause 11 of the Statement of principles which deals with the Transitional Period and in this connectionhad before them the letter which Lord Keynes was authorised to send inDecember 1943 to Dr. White of the United States Treasury on the continuanceof the sterling area arrangements and special payments agreements, of which an extract is attached as Annex D. The United Kingdom Delegation made afull statement of their views on the matter, which would be put before theUnited Kingdom Government.The Committee agree that, in the light of the Statement by the UnitedKingdom Delegation, Clause 11 is satisfactorily designed to safeguard thenecessary freedom of action of member countries during the early post-wardifficulties.In this connection the Committee had a joint discussion with the Com-mittee on Commercial Policy on the commercial practices permissible during the transitional Period and are satisfied that the proposals embodied in the Reportof the Committee on Commercial Policy would help countries to achieveconvertibility of their currencies. ( -Introduction of the Scheme.11. (a) It was suggested that, if this scheme is approved, the Fund shouldbe set up so as to come into operation as soon as practicable after the armistice withGermany or Japan, which ever is the later, and that the Transitional period should begin immediately thereafter.(b)&apos; Exchange Rates. It was considered that the general obligations aboutexchange rates should begin as soon as the scheme was instituted, and attention was called to Clause 11 (4) which indicates that the Fund should give the benefitof the doubt in the Transitional Period to proposals presented by any member countries.[27117] b 2
(c) Payment of Subscriptions. Payment of subscriptions might be by instalments as the full resources of the Fund would not be required at thebeginning of the scheme. This was a matter which might be considered by the wider drafting committee.(d) Availability of quotas. It was a matter for further discussion at a wider conference whether the scheme should further define the conditions inwhich access to the facilities of the Fund should be postponed. For example,if a country was not able to accept the obligations of multilateral convertibility,one of the main purposes for which the scheme was designed, it might be held that it should not draw upon its quotas. Or, again, if a country was in receiptof assistance from UNRRA or of money in tine form of reconstruction loans,it might be argued that it should not simultaneously draw on its quotas. Onthe other hand, the view was expressed that if quotas were not to be availablefor a significant time after the establishment of the Fund, Governments wouldbe extremely reluctant to accept as from the date of establishment the obligationto seek the Fund&apos;s approval to variations in the exchange rate.(e) Multilateral Obligations. By the drafting of Clause 11, it is clear thatthe decision whether a country should accept the obligation of multilateralconvertibility is one for its own decision, subject to requirement to consult withthe Fund at the end. of three years.The proposals for a United Nations Investment Bank.12. The American proposals for this purpose were examined at a special meeting when a Paper by the United Kingdom Delegation* was discussed. TheCommittee agree that the American draft does not provide a satisfactory basis forfurther discussion and progress, and in Annex E they suggest the lines of approach to the United States Departments. The Committee believe that ifthere were general acceptance of a scheme upon the lines of the Annex it wouldbe found to be of value, but they are unable to express any definite view until the shape of such a scheme can be more clearly drawn.Relation to Employment Policy.13. The Committee agree with the view expressed, by the AustralianDelegation that the monetary proposals as well as the other proposals which had resulted from the Article VII discussions should be regarded as a means to enablemember countries to pursue with confidence an internal policy of active employ-ment and the maintenance and improvement of the standard of living of theircommunities. The Committee agree that the draft international agreement on employment policy which is being recommended by the Committee on employment policy should be considered as an integral part of the general proposals.II.-COMMERCIAL POLICY.Introduction.14. In June 1943, discussions between officials of the United Kingdom, theDominions and India on the subject of post-war commercial policy, took place inLondon. At these discussions United Kingdom officials put before dominion and Indian officials proposals for a multilateral commercial policy convention.These proposals were contained in an aide-memoire (afterwards termed theIntroductory Note) and were elaborated in somewhat greater detail in an Illustra-tive Outline. These two documents were examined in detail, and were amended in a number of respects in accordance with suggestions from Dominion and Indianofficials. For convenience, they are attached in the final form in which they were handed to the United Statw officials as Annexes F and G to this paper. It was understood that the view expressed by the United Kingdom, Dominion and indian officials did not commit their Governments in any way. At the end ofthe discussions, the following general conclusion was recorded : &quot; Speaking generally, the Dominion and Indian delegations, while inno way committing their Governments, saw advantages in the UnitedKingdom taking the initiative in informal and exploratory discussions withthe United States on commercial policy, as part of action to promote the positive aims of Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement. The delegationsnoted that this initiative would follow broadly the lines of. the aide-memoire.It was understood that the United Kingdom representatives would be* A.S.D. (44) 12.
speaking at this stage purely for themselves, though, with, the background of the provisional views expressed by the various delegations at the present discussions, and that it would be open to other members of the commonwealth to express their own views at the proper time.&quot;15. The United Kingdom officials next proceeded to discuss commercial policy with United States officials in Washington in September and October 1943.The latter were found to be very well disposed towards the idea of concluding a multilateral commercial policy convention. The Introductory Note and Illustra-tive Outline, as amended in the light of the discussions with Dominion and Indianofficials in June, were therefore used as an agenda for the meetings in Washington.The results of these Anglo-American discussions were embodied in the &quot; AgreedAnglo-American document on Commercial Policy.&quot; This document is referredto below as the &quot; Washington proposals &quot; for short. It is appended as Annex Hto this paper.16. In January and February of this year there were discussions betweenCanadian and United States officials on commercial policy. These discussionsfollowed the same lines as the discussions between United Kingdom and UnitedStates officials, and were based upon the need for a multilateral commercial policyconvention. The Canadian officials have circulated a joint Canadian-UnitedStates statement On these discussions; and a copy of this document is appendedas Annex I to this paper.17. - The present discussions between United Kingdom, Dominion and Indianofficials have been concerned with the examination of the Washington proposals,including the results of the Canadian-United States discussions. The positionstill remains that the Governments, whose officials have participated, areuncommitted by what has been said. In the course of the present discussions,there has been a fairly detailed review of the various problems involved in a multi-lateral commercial policy convention. The views of the delegations on the various matters under discussion are recorded in detail in the Minutes of the presentseries of meetings. The following provides only a summary of the mainexpressions of opinion on the principal topics discussed.Tariffs.18. In the discussions between United Kingdom, Dominion and Indianofficials in June 1943, there was a large measure of agreement that a determinedattempt should be made to fix some limit to the use of tariffs as an instrument of protection, and that the most hopeful method of doing so would be to incorporate in a multilateral agreement provision for the reduction of tariffsaccording to a formula. United Kingdom representatives put forward theseproposals in Washington. They found that United States officials agreed withthem on the desirability of including in the proposed commercial convention a formula for the general reduction of tariffs, if a practicable and equitable formulacould be found. The various formulas which were discussed at Washingtonare to be found in Annex H (paragraph 2 of Section I).19. Some of the formulas discussed at Washington are now considered tobe generally unacceptable; and the present discussions have therefore concen-trated upon an examination of the following three possible formulas for the multilateral reduction of protective duties : (i) There should be a ceiling of a specified height (say, 25 per cent.ad valorem) above which no duty may be charged; there should be a moderate cut (say, by one-quarter of their pre-war level) in all dutiesbelow this ceiling, except that no duty need be reduced below a specified floor (say, 10 per cent, ad valorem). This was the formuladiscussed between United Kingdom, Dominion and Indian officials inJune 1943, and tentatively put forward for discussion by the UnitedKingdom officials in September 1943.(ii) All duties should be reduced by a specified proportion (say, by one-halfof their pre-war level) except that no duty need be reduced below a specified floor (say, 10 per cent, ad valorem). This formula was thesubject of discussion between the Canadian and United States officials in January and February of this year. (See Annex I, paragraph 1 ofSection III.)(iii) In the course of the present discussions, the South African delegationhas put forward a formula for a graduated cut in all duties.   Thus,
all duties might be cut by, say, one half of their pre-war level, subjectto the addition back to the resultant duty of the equivalent of a 5 percent, ad valorem duty. This formula would be combined with a floor of 10 per cent, ad valorem, below which no duty need be reduced. this formula would result in the reduction of a 50 per cent, duty to 30 percent., of a 30 per cent, duty to 20 per cent., and of a 20 per cent, to15 per cent. It might, if desired, be combined with or followed by the fixing of a &quot; ceiling &quot; above which no duty might be charged.20. A general discussion of these three formulas revealed the followingviews : In the opinion of some delegations, and in particular of the UnitedKingdom, South African and Canadian officials, the fixation of a moderate ceilingat, say, 25 per cent, ad valorem,, as envisaged in Formula (i) above, might properlyremain the ultimate objective as being the most effective means of eliminatingunduly high tariffs; but it was felt, particularly by the Australian delegation,that, as a first step, it might operate too drastically for it to be politically oreconomically possible for some countries to undertake the necessary immediateadjustment. On the other hand, it was urged by several delegations that a straightcut of, say, 50 per cent, in all duties, even if it were combined, as in Formula (ii)above, with a 10 per cent, floor, would be inequitable in that it would not impose a relatively greater cut on high than on moderate duties. It was, therefore,generally agreed that the South African proposal for a graduated cut in duties(as, for example, in Formula (iii) above) merited further examination, as holding out promise of a solution which would avoid the drastic results of an immediateceiling without imposing as severe a cut on moderate as on high tariffs.21. It was recognised that each of these tariff formulas would involve in greater or less degree technical difficulties in their application. In particular,they would all involve the problems of assessing the ad valorem incidence of specific duties, and of making allowance for variations in the incidence of pre-warspecific duties already brought about by changes in prices. A considerable time was devoted to the discussion of the technical difficulties. In general, it wasagreed that it should be possible to find means of overcoming these difficulties; butthere was some difference of opinion on the best methods to be adopted for thispurpose, and the Australian delegation considered that it was not certain thata practical solution of all the technical difficulties was yet in sight. -22. In general, the United Kingdom, Canadian, New Zealand and SouthAfrican delegations, while realising the nature of the adjustment to theireconomies which a general reduction of their tariffs would involve, expressed the strong opinion (which they understand is now shared by most United states officials) that the best hope of reducing all types of trade barriers over a wide area, as an essential contribution to the expansion of international trade, was by means of a commercial policy convention containing, among other provisions,a multilateral formula for the reduction of tariffs. In the view of these fourdelegations, the only alternatives appear to be either a tariff standstill based onthe position before the war, which they regard as impracticable and, indeed,highly inequitable, or bilateral negotiations, which they consider to be too slow,piecemeal and uncertain in result.23. The United Kingdom delegation pointed out the importance to theUnited Kingdom of the reduction of all forms of trade barrier over the widest possible area, since she must depend largely for her new export opportunitiesupon countries other than-the United States. The Canadian delegation statedthat, while by far the greater part of Canadian trade was with the UnitedKingdom and United States, they attached great importance to a multilateral trade convention which would reduce trade barriers on the continent of Europe,as well as elsewhere.24. The New Zealand and Australian delegations, while supporting the multilateral approach, pointed out that bilateral agreements under the UnitedStates Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act might, for them, be a means of obtainingbenefits in the United States at a lower cost in counter-concessions. The NewZealand delegation stated that none of the tariff formulas discussed atWashington appeared to meet the needs of New Zealand, but agreed that theSouth African proposal for a graduated cut merited close examination. TheSouth African delegation stated that South Africa stood to lose considerable advantages arising from the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act if bilateral agreements could not be concluded. with the United States pending the finalcoming into effect of the multilateral convention.
25. The Australian delegation expressed doubts as to the desirability of proceeding by a general formula for tariff reductions. A general formula would impose reductions of protection on all industries, regardless of their intrinsicworth; and it might impose on Australia heavier obligations in return for concessions which she might better obtain by a series of bilateral trade agree-ments. They thought, however, that some of these difficulties might be moderatedby a policy for the maintenance of full employment throughout the major countries of the world; by the substitution for the ceiling of a system of graduated tariff reductions; by reasonable arrangements for the imposition of moderate newprotective duties; by the use of subsidies as an additional means of protection;and by approaching tariff reductions through a series of steps rather than asingle cut.26. The Indian delegation stated that India was generally sympathetic, tothe suggestion for multilateral treatment of tariffs. India is, on the whole, a country with a very limited range of &quot; protective &quot; duties and any protectionarising out of the general tariff is incidental and moderate. India would beprepared to face a moderate reduction in the general run of her duties imposedfor revenue purposes, but the method of this reduction should be left to theGovernment of India. Provision must, however, be made for the imposition of&quot; protective duties,&quot; imposed after Tariff Board enquiries, for the purpose ofgiving temporary protection to those industries which have proved a case for protection, or which have been started to meet war emergencies, and which theGovernment of India find it necessary to assist.27. As a result of the discussions on tariffs, there was general agreement that, subject to the points reserved by India, the following procedure deservedcareful examination as a possible means of meeting the varied problems of theUnited Kingdom, the Dominions and India : (i) Stress should be laid upon the importance of maintaining a high levelof employment and of trade activity if a widespread reduction oftrade barriers is to be practicable,(ii) The effect of a graduated tariff cut of the kind suggested in Formula (iii)of paragraph 6 above, at any rate as a first stage of tariff reduction,should be carefully examined from the point of view of its effect uponthe trade of the United Kingdom, the Dominions and India.(iii) In their discussions at Washington, the United Kingdom officials had maintained that some exceptional tariff treatment would be necessaryfor infant industries. Provision must be made for the imposition ofnew protective duties at a moderate level by countries which need todevelop new industries. It is suggested that this might be allowed bya rule which permitted a country to give protection for a specifiednumber of years, at a level not exceeding a specified height, on any commodity of which it was then producing less than a specifiedproportion of its total consumption; at the end of this temporaryperiod, the protection would have to come down to a more moderatespecified level; and in addition to this, the position should be main-tained in argument with the Americans that any protective dutycould be imposed or raised up to the floor of 10 per cent, ad valorem.The Canadian delegation doubted the wisdom of a floor provision ofthis nature, which would permit a general increase in existing freerates or duties below 10 per cent.(iv) Emphasis should be laid upon the right to use direct subsidies as a supplementary or alternative method of protection,(v) Subject to the Australian reservations mentioned in paragraph 25 above,it was generally agreed that early action for a substantial cut in tariffswas desirable. In this way, the United States and other creditorcountries with high tariffs would be obliged to make an immediatecontribution to economic readjustment; the regrowth of vested interests behind tariff barriers would be avoided; and the conversionof industry from war to peace conditions would, from the outset, takeplace in the light of the new tariff levels. For these reasons, early action should be taken for the application of the tariff cut mentioned at (ii) above. The Canadian, South African and New Zealand delcga-tions considered that provision should also be made for the impositionof a tariff ceiling, whether immediately or at a later stage. The UnitedKingdom officials agreed, that such a limitation of high tariffs was
all duties might be cut by, say, one half of their pre-war level, subjectto the addition back to the resultant duty of the equivalent of a 5 percent, ad valorem duty. This formula would be combined with a floor of 10 per cent, ad valorem, below which no duty need be reduced. this formula would result in the reduction of a 50 per cent, duty to 30 percent., of a 30 per cent, duty to 20 per cent., and of a 20 per cent, to15 per cent. It might, if desired, be combined with or followed by the fixing of a &quot; ceiling&apos;&apos; above which no duty might be charged.20. A general discussion of these three formulas revealed the followingviews: In the opinion of some delegations, and in particular of the UnitedKingdom, South African and Canadian officials, the fixation of a moderate ceilingat, say, 25 per cent, ad valorem, as envisaged in Formula (i) above, might properlyremain the ultimate objective as being the most effective means of eliminatingunduly high tariffs; but it was felt, particularly by the Australian delegation,that, as a first step, it might operate too drastically for it to be politically oreconomically possible for some countries to undertake the necessary immediateadjustment.

Provision must, however, be made for the imposition of&quot; protective duties,&quot; imposed after Tariff Board enquiries, for the purpose ofgiving temporary protection to those industries which have proved a case for protection, or which have been started to meet war emergencies, and which theGovernment of India find it necessary to assist.27. As a result of the discussions on tariffs, there was general agreement that, subject to the points reserved by India, the following procedure deservedcareful examination as a possible means of meeting the varied problems of theUnited Kingdom, the Dominions and India : (i) Stress should be laid upon the importance of maintaining a high levelof employment and of trade activity if a widespread reduction oftrade barriers is to be practicable,(ii) The effect of a graduated tariff cut of the kind suggested in Formula (iii)of paragraph 6 above, at any rate as a first stage of tariff reduction,should be carefully examined from the point of view of its effect uponthe trade of the United Kingdom, the Dominions and India.(iii) In their discussions at Washington, the United Kingdom officials had maintained that some exceptional tariff treatment would be necessaryfor infant industries. Provision must be made for the imposition ofnew protective duties at a moderate level by countries which need todevelop new industries. It is suggested that this might be allowed bya rule which permitted a country to give protection for a specifiednumber of years, at a level not exceeding a specified height, on any commodity of which it was then producing less than a specifiedproportion of its total consumption; at the end of this temporaryperiod, the protection would have to come down to a more moderatespecified level; and in addition to this, the position should be main-tained in argument with the Americans that any protective dutycould be imposed or raised up to the floor of 10 per cent, ad valorem.The Canadian delegation doubted the wisdom of a floor provision ofthis nature, which would permit a general increase in existing freerates or duties below 10 per cent.(iv) Emphasis should be laid upon the right to use direct subsidies as a supplementary or alternative method of protection.(v) Subject to the Australian reservations mentioned in paragraph 25 above,it was generally agreed that early action for a substantial cut in tariffswas desirable. In this way, the United States and other creditorcountries with high tariffs would be obliged to make an immediatecontribution to economic readjustment; the regrowth of vested interests behind tariff barriers would be avoided; and the conversionof industry from war to peace conditions would, from the outset, takeplace in the light of the new tariff levels. For these reasons, early action should be taken for the application of the tariff cut mentioned at (ii) above. The Canadian, South African and New Zealand delcga-tions considered that provision should also be made for the impositionof a tariff ceiling, whether immediately or at a later stage. The UnitedKingdom officials agreed, that such a limitation of high tariffs was
most desirable, but wished to give further thought to the furtherpreference reductions which would be involved in the application of asecond stage of tariff reductions.28. All that is said above relates to protective duties. Revenue duties,as defined in the previous discussions, would be excluded from the scope of theproposals for tariff reduction. However, it was agreed that there must be somerecourse for countries finding that their export trade is being prejudiced by duties in other countries which, while falling within the definition of revenue duties, areprohibitory rather than revenue-yielding in effect.Preferences.29. In the summary of the discussions with representatives of the Dominionsand India in London in June 1943, the general conclusion was recorded that&quot; some substantial reduction in Imperial preferences would be inevitable if anygeneral commercial agreement with the United States was to be reached.&quot;Accordingly, in the course of the non-committal exploration on which they were engaged at Washington, the United Kingdom officials offered to examine theeffects of a 50 per cent, cut in all preferential margins with a proviso that nopreferential margin need be reduced below a 5 per cent, ad valorem,, on the clear understanding that this could only be part of a general agreement on commercial policy by which the major obstacles to the United Kingdom export trade in theform of import restrictions and export subsidies would be simultaneously removedover a wide area, and the United States and other high tariffs would be broughtforthwith to a ceiling of 25 per cent, ad valorem.30. The Canadian officials in January and February of this year put con-crete proposals before the United States officials for the reduction of preferences.(See Annex I, Section IV.)   Their proposals have three aspects:  (1) They suggest that all margins of preference at present bound (i.e.,guaranteed against reduction under the terms of a trade agreement)should be unbound, in order to signify to the Americans that the waywas being left open for such reductions of preferences as might here-after be agreed.(2) In order to bring out as clearly as possible the interdependence betweenthe reduction of tariffs and of preferences, they advocate theadoption of a method which would achieve both results in one opera-tion, and would automatically result in a considerable adjustment of preferences only if the United States and other countries simul-taneously made a drastic reduction of their tariffs. Any multilateralformula for the reduction of tariffs should be applied to non-preferential rates of duty only. This would have the effect of closingpreferential margins by reducing non-preferential rates of dutytowards the preferential rates. Preference margins would be entirelyeliminated in a number of cases where this brought the non-preferential rates of duty down to the preferential rates. this procedure would, however, leave a large number Of residual preferencesin cases where preferential rates of duty were low or there waspreferential free entry.(3) The Canadian officials attach importance to the view that preferencesshould not be reduced by means of increasing rates of duty between members of the British Commonwealth. Such increases would, intheir view, not only be politically unfortunate, but would run counter to the whole object of the proposed. convention, namely, to producefreer trade. The procedure proposed by the Canadians would not involve the raising of any preferential rates of duty.31. The Canadian representatives emphasise that these proposals wouldinvolve a major adjustment of the Canadian economy; but, to Canada, the com-pletion of a multilateral agreement is so important that the reductions in pre-ferences resulting from substantial reductions in duties must be contemplated.32. The United Kingdom, Dominion and Indian delegations all agreed thatthe reduction of preferences should be made dependent on the reduction of tariffs,and that an adjustment of preferences should be contemplated only in return fora sufficient reduction of tariffs and other barriers to trade which, in the words of Article VII, led to &apos;&apos; mutually advantageous economic relations &apos;&apos; between thecountries concerned.  It was recognised that Article VII, though it distinguished
between the final goals of the reduction of tariha and the elimination of discriminatory treatment, contemplated that it. might prove possible immediately to take only the first step towards these objectives. The Canadian, South African,New Zealand and Indian delegations, however, stated that, although a radicaladjustment of preferences would involve serious problems of adjustment for theireconomies, they would be prepared to face substantial reductions of preferences,extending to the abolition of some, in return for sufficiently extensive counter-concessions.33. The Australian officials, while recognising . some reductions inpreferences to be inevitable in accordance with the terms of the Mutual aid agreement, explain that the Commonwealth Government, before committing themselves to any substantial reductions, would need a clear idea of the effectsuch reductions are likely to have upon the Australian export trade. Theprospects for Australian exports are very dependent upon the extent to whichthe United States duties on important Australian commodities, for example, wool,meat and butter, can be reduced. Moreover, Australia was concerned lest thebuying power of other Empire countries should be impaired. The reduction of duties contemplated under the proposed tariff formulas might not be sufficientto ensure that Australia had a substantial market in the United States, and though Australia normally has a large trade in European countries, such countries would not be required to grant concessions which would contribute to the increasedtrade in important Australian products, including wool, though it might helpin others, such as beef and butter. Commodity agreements, particularly in such products as wheat and sugar, might be of considerable assistance. But, in viewof all these uncertainties, the Commonwealth Government may wish to retain a fair margin of preference for some products in the United Kingdom market:34: The Colonial Office representative drew attention to the special positionof sugar. The possibility could scarcely be contemplated of applying to sugarthe suggested general rules for the reduction of tariffs and preferences, if sugarwere not made the subject of a special commodity agreement.35. The United Kingdom delegation suggested that there was a case for examining carefully the effects of a formula for the reduction of preferences ofthe following kind : (i) Non-preferential rates of duty might be reduced by a graduated cut of the kind outlined in Formula (iii) of paragraph 19 above,(ii) This might be combined with a rule that preferential rates of dutyshould be reduced whenever this was necessary to preserve a minimumpreferential margin of 5 per cent, ad valorem. This was the Canadianmethod of reducing preferential margins, with the added proviso thatno existing preferential margin would be reduced below 5 per cent.ad valorem.(iii) In the case of preferences given in revenue duties, the preferentialmargin (where there was no domestic production) or (where there wasdomestic production) the margin between the non-preferential rate and the rate of internal excise duty, might be treated as a protectiveduty -requiring reduction. This would allow revenue duties to beraised for the purpose of obtaining more revenue; but it wouldinvolve a reduction of preferential margins within such duties.(iv) United Kingdom officials doubted the wisdom of unbinding all boundmargins of preference, since this might enable one member of theCommonwealth to obtain commercial advantages at the expense of another and might lead to discrimination within the Empire.36. The Dominion and Indian officials agreed that the effects on their trade of these rules for tariff and preference reductions deserved further close examination. The fear was, however, expressed by all the delegations that aminimum preferential margin of 5 per cent, ad valorem might prove unacceptable to the United States authorities. In their estimation, the strength of the UnitedStates pressure against preferences is increasing, particularly in the cases of preferences granted by the Colonies and of those on commodities where there isno domestic production.Quantitative Restrictions on Imports.37.   The Washington proposals for the treatment of quantitative restrictions(see Section III of Annex H) followed closely the suggestions discussed in London- [27117] ^ c
in June 1943. Quantitative regulation of imports was to be generally permittedduring the period of transitional readjustment after the war. Subsequently, itwas to be banned except for certain recognised uses, of which the most importantwere : first, for the implementation of a recognised international commodity agree-ment; secondly, in order to safeguard a country&apos;s balance of payments. In thelatter case, it was generally to be applied in a non-discriminatory manner,although a special &quot; discriminatory &quot; use of such restrictions would have hadto be permitted for the purpose of rationing a &quot; scarce currency.&quot;38. There was general acceptance of the view that, except for specialpurposes, such as the carrying out of international commodity arrangements or thedefence of the balance of payments, the use of quantitative restrictions should beforbidden. The New Zealand delegation, however, stated that the New zealand government attached importance to import licensing as a means of ensuring(i) the protection of infant industries, (ii) that, financially, the country livedwithin its income, and (iii) that available funds were used selectively to the best advantage. They also thought that, if points (ii) and (iii) above were not coveredby the permitted use of quantitative restrictions on balance of payments grounds,the New Zealand- Government might make more extensive use of State trading.The Australian, South African and Indian delegations thought that, in someexceptional circumstances, quantitative restrictions might prove more desirablethan other protective measures.39. There was general agreement among all the delegations that the suggested rules for the use of quantitative restrictions on balance of paymentsgrounds (See Annex H, Section III, paragraph 2 (a)) needed to be amended insuch a way as to ensure (i) that the use of quantitative restrictions on these grounds should not be forbidden merely because some unavoidable capital exports were taking place, and (ii) that, so long as a country is entitled to maintainquantitative restrictions on balance of payments grounds, as judged by theappropriate objective criterion, that country must retain freedom to impose such restrictions without reference to the amounts imported in previous years. an unfavourable balance of payments due to a decline in a country&apos;s exports might need to be rapidly met by a positive reduction of imports below previous levels.40. It was agreed that the feasibility of evolving satisfactory objectivecriteria required careful examination; but it was pointed out, particularly by theCanadian delegation, that acceptance in the United States of a scheme permittingthe use of quantitative restrictions in exceptional circumstances would only be forthcoming if the conditions for their use were clearly laid down in advance.It was generally agreed that a satisfactory criterion might be found if it were based upon the level of a country&apos;s monetary reserves and upon movements inthose reserves. The definition of &quot; monetary&apos; reserves &quot; for this purpose should include part, but not the whole, of a country&apos;s unexhausted borrowing power withthe International Monetary Fund. To an appropriate extent, countries wouldhave to be permitted to set off against their reserves their sight fiabilities to othercountries, and would have to include in their own reserves their quick assets inother countries&apos; currencies.41. The following example of a possible objective criterion was put forward,merely by way of illustration of the sort of considerations to be covered : (i) A country would be entitled to impose, or to continue, quantitative regulation of its imports, on a non-discriminatory basis, if it could show, in consultation with the Monetary Fund, either that its monetaryreserves, as defined below, were less than A per cent, of its quota withthe Monetary Fund, or that its monetary reserves were both less thanB per cent, of its quota (B being greater than A) and also had not increased by more than C per cent, of its quota during the last threeyears.(ii) A country&apos;s &quot;monetary reserves&quot; might include:-(a) its net official holdings of gold and gold-convertible currencies;(b) the amount by which the Monetary Fund&apos;s actual holdings of its currency fell short of 150 per cent, of its quota with the Fund.(iii) &quot; Net &quot; official holdings of gold and gold-convertible currencies shouldbe calculated after deduction of official gold-convertible liabilities.(iv) &quot;Official&quot; holdings would normally be confined to the holdings .ofTreasuries, Central Banks, or other official bodies, but might be defined by the Monetary Fund to cover certain non-official holdings in the caseof countries where it is the practice for some reserves to be held by private institutions in excess of the. requirements of working balances.
(v) After a country had accepted multilateral (but not gold) convertibility,that part of another member&apos;s official balances with that country whichhad become subject to such convertibility would also count as part ofthe latter&apos;s &quot;monetary reserves,&quot; and would be deductible from the&quot;former country&apos;s calculation of its &quot; monetary reserves.&quot;42. The Australian delegation stated that, unless A, B and, C in the aboveformula were sufficiently high, it might be necessary to preserve a country&apos;s rightto use import restrictions on balance of payments grounds when the international monetary Fund (under Clause 4 (ii) (c) of the Statement of Principles) restrictedthe rate at which a country could use its borrowing power with the Fund. Whilestressing the need for the use of quantitative restrictions on balance of paymentsgrounds, they emphasised that depreciation of the Australian exchange ratemight be as important for Australia.. In some circumstances, exchange deprecia-tion, rather than quantitative regulation of imports, might be the appropriateway of adjusting the internal economy of Australia in order to meet a declinein the demand for her exports.Subsidies.43. In the London discussions of June 1943, the suggestions had beendiscussed (i) that export subsidies in the sense of State action which resulted inthe sale of goods in foreign markets at prices lower than those corresponding tothe internal domestic prices should be prohibited, but (ii) that direct and opensubsidies on total production should be permitted. The United. States officials at Washington had agreed to these proposals, subject to the important proviso that, in the case of commodities such as wheat and cotton which were likely to bein world surplus supply, it would not be possible to ban export subsidies unlesssubsidies on - production in importing countries were limited. The UnitedKingdom officials did not feel able to accept any such limitation, and, remain unchanged in their opinion. In the present discussions, there was general agree-ment that a safety-valve in the form of subsidies to total production is a necessaryfeature of the general commercial policy convention.44. The United States officials in their discussion with United Kingdomofficials put forward the suggestion that, unless a general formula could be foundto meet the difficulty, the alternative would be to deal with the problem of subsidy-on the basis of individual commodities.45. The Canadian officials in the course of their discussions with theUnited States officials in January and February 1944, had also insisted that export subsidies should be banned, and subsidies on total production permitted. Thelatter then elaborated their suggestion above mentioned, in the sense that inter-national agreements would be sought in respect of a list of commodities in whichthey saw particular difficulty in applying the convention rules, e.g., wheat, cotton and, vegetable oils. For commodities on such a list, the use of export subsidieswould not be prohibited. This proposal was, however, felt to be objectionable,in that other countries would wish to add to this list, which would thus becometoo long and. would open up a wide loophole for the use of restrictive practicesoutside the convention.46. The evidence points to the likelihood of the United States officialsreturning to this point with some insistence. If so, it was suggested that asolution might be sought on the lines that, in the case of commodities declared by some agreed procedure to be in world surplus supply, the rule against export subsidies would lapse unless an ad hoc agreement were reached to limit subsidies on production.47, The Canadian representatives recognised, in the light of theirindependent discussions, that the United States Government would be faced witha difficult task in getting rid of their present arrangements for a two-price system for such commodities as wheat and cotton; but they urged upon United states officials the necessity of dealing with this problem in a way which did not involvethe use of quantitative restrictions on imports such as was required under a two-price system in order to protect the domestic market against imports at thelower external price. They pointed out to the United States officials that thepayment of direct and indirect subsidies in any form might have undesirableeffects on production, but that the method of income subsidies to producers, State-guaranteed prices to producers, or processing taxes, could be operated in a &apos;&apos;.   [27117] c 2
manner which did not require the use of quantitative restrictions involved ina two-price system. They consider that the United States officials are now fully aware of the need to revise their arrangements in such a way as to eliminate, ifpossible, the need for a two-price system.48. The Australian delegation drew a distinction between subsidies onsecondary products and those on primary products. For the latter, it seemed thatthe Agreed Statement took exception to two-price schemes but not to processingtax arrangements. It seemed from Australian experience that there was verylittle difference in the economic effects of the two types of schemes. Subsidiesout of general revenue were in a different category, of course, but under all threeschemes production would be stimulated and some control of production might at times be needed as a condition of arrangements for giving support to the producers of primary products. The Australian delegation wished to examine further the fiscal, political and administrative effects upon the Australian economy of the proposal that export subsidies should be abolished but subsidies to generalproduction permitted.49. There was provisional agreement among the United Kingdom,Canadian, South African, New Zealand and Indian officials that export subsidies,as defined in paragraph 43 above, should be abolished, but subsidies to generalproduction permitted. This agrement was subject to the following points : TheUnited Kingdom delegation stressed the need for further examination of thepractical problem of enforcing a ban on export subsidies. The South Africanofficials suggested that export subsidies might best be abolished gradually by stages in order to give the countries concerned time to carry out the necessary adjustments. The Indian delegation, while agreeing with the general line taken on the subject of export subsidies by the United Kingdom and Canadian officials,dissented from the view that tariff protection was, in general, less desirable thanthe subsidisation of production.State Trading:50. In the discussions with Dominion and Indian officials in June 1943,it was agreed that any multilateral commercial convention should leave room for State trading, but should contain provisions that would prevent this&quot;freedom from being misused in such a way as to confer an excessive degree ofprotection upon domestic producers, or to discriminate between external markets and sources of supply. United States officials were found to hold similar views.An attempt was therefore made in the Washington proposals to elaborate insome detail a set of general principles to cover State trading (see Section VI of annex 4). These proposals differed in two ways from those discussed inLondon in June 1943. First, the United States officials were opposed to theidea of Governments setting (up counter-monopolies for the purpose ofmonopolising the trade with a State trading country in commodities which were left to private enterprise so far as the trade with other countries was concerned.Secondly, the United States officials had suggested that a country with a completely socialised economy (such as the U.S.S.R.) might be asked to commititself to a minimum global purchase of goods from the rest of the world as its contribution to the expansion of world trade.51. The Dominion and Indian representatives are in general agreement that the Washington proposals represent the right approach to the problem ofState trading. They recognise that the obligations not to misuse State tradingfor giving excessive protection or for discriminating between foreign sources ofsupply will be difficult to enforce, but suggest that provision for appeal by anaggrieved country to the proposed international commercial policy organisaion may, in some cases, be useful. The United Kingdom and Canadian delegationsdoubt whether it would be politically expedient to require a completely socialisedcountry, such as the U.S.S.R., to guarantee a minimum global purchase of commodities from the rest of the world. It was the view of all the delegationsthat a draft convention should not contain any provisions for or against theestablishment of counter-monopolies.52. Much stress was laid, particularly by the New Zealand delegation, onthe need to preserve the right for State trading organisations to enter intolong-term contracts both for the sale and the purchase of commodities. this right has been preserved in the Washington proposals on the insistence of theUnited Kingdom officials, provided that such contracts are settled on a basis
of non-discrimination. The question was raised by the Australian delegationwhether, after entering into a long-term contract to sell its produce at a givenprice, a Government could, by means of quantitative restriction of imports,protect its home market against the effects of any subsequent decline in world prices. On this, the view was taken that, in these circumstances, theWashington proposals would allow the imposition of prohibitions on private trade to maintain a State trading monopoly, but it was felt that, if a monopolydid not exist it would be inconsistent with the convention for quantitative restrictions to be imposed.International Commercial Policy Organisation.53. The Washington proposals on the question of the establishment of aninternational commercial policy organisation differ little from the proposalsdiscussed with Dominion representatives in June 1943. The United Kingdom,Dominion and Indian officials agree in general with the treatment of this subject in the Washington proposals.   (Section VII of Annex H.)54. The United Kingdom, Dominion and Indian representatives have given some attention to the question of the treatment of States which do not adhere to the convention. It is generally agreed that, in the ordinary way, the benefits of the convention should be denied to non-members, but that a member shouldbe permitted to make an agreement with a non-member, provided that thenon-member extended to all other members of the organisation the benefits whichit granted under such an agreement, and provided, moreover, that before theagreement came into force, the international commercial policy organisation hadnot considered the agreement objectionable, either generally or in its effects on anymember country. There is general support for a suggestion of the Canadianrepresentatives that, when tariff reductions and other benefits of the conventionenter into force, they should be extended to non-member countries for a statedtime to cover the period of notice generally required for the revocation of tradetreaties and most-favoured-nation arrangements, and that, after the expiry ofthis period, the benefits (which in practice would be mainly tariff reductions)should be withdrawn from countries which have not adhered to the convention.The Australian representatives, whilst not dissenting from these views, wish tosee which countries refuse to become members before deciding how non-members should be treated.55. As a particular instance of the question of the treatment of non-adherentStates, the United Kingdom, Dominion and Indian representatives have explored,in a tentative manner, what would be the economic results of the proposed rulesin the event of the failure of a member of the British Commonwealth of nations to adhere to the convention. It is recognised that this question also raises political issues outside the scope of the present discussions. The results of denying to non-adherent States the advantages of any tariff reductions under the multilateralconvention would depend mainly upon the nature of the formula for the reductionof tariffs and upon the magnitude of the reductions. If preferential rates of duty were left unchanged and the amount of the reduction in non-preferential rates of duty were smaller than the existing preferential margins, any memberof the Commonwealth that did not adhere would still receive from other membersof the Commonwealth more favourable treatment than the latter were giving to foreign adhering States. If, on the other hand, the reduction in non-preferen-tial rates of duty were greater than the existing preferential margins, a memberof the Commonwealth that did not adhere would receive from other Common-wealth countries less favourable treatment than the latter were giving to foreignadhering States. Under the latter alternative, an ad hoc agreement could perhaps be concluded with the non-adherent Commonwealth country on the lines contemplated in paragraph 54 above.Problems of Timing and of the Transitional Period.56. During the course of the present. discussions, United Kingdom,Dominion and Indian officials have given a good deal of consideration to theproblems of the transitional period immediately following the war. They havedevoted some thought to the need for retaining various forms of trade restrictionsduring this period, and to the question of the procedure and timetable for bringing any commercial convention into force.57. At the previous discussions in June 1943, it was suggested that many countries would be obliged to retain control over their import trade immediately
after the war; and the United Kingdom officials put forward arrangements fora two-phase transitional period which took account of this fact. (See Section Fof Annex G.) This view was stressed by the United Kingdom officials atWashington, and the United States representatives recognised the need for someexceptional provision to meet the necessities of the transitional period. (see annex H, Section III, paragraph 3.) The United States officials, however,made it clear, both to the United Kingdom and to the Canadian officials, that itwould not be feasible for the United States to reduce her tariffs unless there wereto be some definite commitment as to the time at which, or conditions on which,countries would abandon the use of quantitative restriction of their imports.58. There are two currents of thought on the question whether the conven-tion should provide for an early and drastic cut or for a gradual and step-by-step reduction in trade barriers. On the one hand, there is the view, shared by themajority of the delegations, that adjustment to a lower level of protection could best be effected at the same time as the radical reorganisation which would be inevitable in the transition from war to peace, so as to avoid the necessity for conducting reconversion in two stages; that the time would then be ripe andpublic opinion ready for the introduction of sweeping measures for the reductionof restrictions on trade; that the early reduction of tariffs, particularly in theUnited States, would make it easier for other countries to dispense withquantitative restrictions; and that for tariffs to be cut before quantitative restrictions were abolished would constitute rough and ready justice between countries which possess well-organised tariffs and those which have hithertoplaced great reliance upon quantitative restrictions.59. On the other hand, the view is advanced by the Australian representa-tives, that the convention should provide for trade barriers to be reducedgradually, in order to allow countries time to adjust themselves to lower levels of protection. It is argued that the objectives of the Washington proposals could not be achieved without affecting some industries very seriously indeed;that Governments would not be willing to face the risk of serious unemployment at the time when demobilisation was proceeding; that the simultaneous adjust-ment from war to peace conditions and from high to low protection would bemore than many countries could stand, particularly those whose industries havebeen dislocated by the war; that smaller countries would need time to see whetherlarger countries were willing and able to maintain full employment; and finally,that the gradual assumption of the more drastic obligations would not interferewith the attainment of the objectives of the convention, because the transitional period would be one of scarcities, which would, in any case, encourage importing countries not to place obstacles in the way of imports.60. Subject to the above points raised by the Australian delegation, it hasbeen agreed that the following might prove a suitable procedure for bringing thecommercial policy convention into force :- (i) A conference of Governments would be held as soon as practicable forthe signature of the convention. The convention would come intoforce as soon as it had been accepted by the Governments of countrieswhich accounted for not less than, say, two-thirds of pre-war world trade.(ii) Certain obligations under the convention would then become operative.For example, immediate steps would be taken to build up the inter-national institutions contemplated by the convention. There wouldbe an immediate obligation on the part of member-States to consult with each other about their transitional commercial policy arrange-ments, with the two-fold object of ensuring that these arrangementsled as easily as possible towards the final objectives of the convention,and that any member-State which felt aggrieved by the action of another member might have an opportunity of expressing its&apos;com-plaint. Finally, there would be certain immediate obligations for thecollection of statistics and the provision of other information on an agreed basis. The statistical information so collected might prove ofgreat value when the stage was reached for the application of a multilateral formula for the reduction of tariffs,(iii) The obligations of the Commercial Convention covering tariffs, pre-ferences, export subsidies and State trading should come into force at the earliest date after the armistice with Germany or Japan, which-ever is the later, that could be agreed upon when the convention is
accepted as at (i) above, subject to the qualification that a country would be entitled to impose an import programme for a defined period after that armistice, a period for which United Kingdom officialspropose a term of five years,(iv) A country would be entitled to continue beyond this period an import programme, which should., however, then be on a non-discriminatorybasis, if it Avere able to show, in consultation with the Monetary Fund,that the position of its monetary reserves made this necessary. Theposition should be judged in the light of the objective criteriondiscussed above (paragraph 41).General Conclusion.61. As the consideration of commercial policy has progressed through thediscussions in London of June 1943, the Anglo-American discussions in washington of September and October 1943, the Canadian-United States dis-cussions in Washington and New York of January and February 1944, and thepresent series of meetings, the problems have become more and more clearly defined. This has naturally resulted in a more precise presentation of the realdifficulties inherent in a multilateral commercial policy convention; but it hasalso served to emphasise the great advantages to be gained from such a multi-lateral approach. It will be recalled that the declared objective of the Anglo-American discussions which opened last September was to make progress withthe United States in framing an acceptable scheme before it was launched and discussed in a wider circle of the United Nations. All available informationsuggests that United States officials are now persuaded of the need for the multi-lateral treatment of post-war commercial problems, and in spite of the impendingelections, are in favour of proceeding with their programme for its attainment.The officials taking part in the present discussions find that a stage has now beenreached where issues of higher policy are involved in several outstanding points of difficulty on which further discussion with the United States officials willprobably be focussed. They are of opinion, therefore, that guidance on such issues of policy, of a more definite character than has hitherto been necessary, will now be required, if further discussions with the United States at the official levelare to hold out the prospect of useful and acceptable results.III.-COMMODITY POLICY.Introduction.62. The Committee has held six meetings. After hearing from ProfessorBobbins an account of the Washington discussions on commodity policy, andfrom Mr. Mackintosh an account of the Canadian conversations with Americanofficials on this subject, the Committee proceeded to examine in detail the AgreedAnglo-American Document on Commodity Policy (Annex J). The UnitedKingdom representatives stressed, at the outset, that the essence of this document was an international code of rules for commodity policy together with an inter-national organisation to administer it, and not any particular technique of control.They pointed out that the Document referred only to &quot;primary products,&quot;though even this term left the line of demarcation between &apos;&apos; commodity policy&apos;&apos;and &quot; cartel policy &quot; somewhat arbitrary.Section I General Principles.63. General approval was given to the general objectives of international commodity policy set out in this Section as a framework within which individualcommodity agreements should be made.Section II Organisation.64. The discussion on organisation revealed certain ambiguities in the drafting of Section II. In the view of the Australian delegates, which was shared by other delegations, the general effect of paragraphs 3 and 7 was to confer onthe international commodity organisation undesirably wide powers in relationto individual commodity controls and to Governments. They pointed, out thatin paragraph 7 the individual commodity organisations were envisaged as agenciesto assist the General Executive. The power of the international commodityorganisation to initiate agreements, they argued, occupied too prominent a.position, and it was not made clear in paragraph 3 that during the negotiationsfor all agreements, however initiated, Governments should be consulted at all
stages and not only when the agreements were submitted, for conclusion. TheNew Zealand representatives also pressed for some indication of the circumstances in which the international commodity organisation would exercise its powers ofinitiating commodity agreements.65. The United Kingdom delegation explained that most of theseambiguities arose from the difference in the way in which the United states representatives and the United Kingdom representatives at the washington disscusions had, conceived the nature of the international commodity organisation.The United States representatives had thought of the organisation as a strongcentral authority and of the individual commodity controls as ancillary organisa-tions. The United Kingdom representatives, on the other hand, had thought ofthe organisation more as a federation of semi-autonomous arrangements. At theend of the Washington discussions the United States officials had to some extentmodified their views and, the change was not fully reflected in the Document.There remained, however, a doubt as to how far the change in the attitude of theUnited States officials had really gone.66. The Committee devoted considerable attention to the proper relation ofthe General Commodity Council and the General Executive to individual Govern-ments and to the individual commodity organisations. There was generalagreement that the General Commodity Council should consist of representativesof all the signatory States, but that until its nature and functions were more closely defined it would not be useful to attempt to determine the basis of voting on it. The Australian and Indian representatives argued that the principlesuggested in paragraph 5 by which the allocation of votes among the membersof the General Council should take account of their respective share in inter-national trade might be inequitable. The Canadian representatives suggestedthat the Governing Body, of the international commodity organisation might be identical with the General Council administering the convention on commercial policy, and it was generally agreed, that this suggestion well deserved furtherconsideration.67. There was general agreement that the Executive should consist ofa small number of persons generally competent in the field of commodity policyappointed by the General Commodity Council and not of representatives of member States nor of experts in particular commodities. The Australianrepresentatives emphasised that such a body of general experts could not direct the individual commodity controls, which would contain representatives of governments, to follow a particular line of policy. They insisted also that anycase in which the General Executive made an unfavourable report on an agree-ment should be referred to the General Council which should, if necessary,approach the Governments concerned direct. The Australian representativesenvisaged, however, that the General Executive might assist the individualcommodity organisations in various ways. In certain cases the Executive might appropriately take the initiative in suggesting a commodity agreement to a group of Governments. While agreements were being negotiated it wouldacquaint the representatives of the countries involved with the agreed principlesof international commodity policy, and would guide the discussions and attemptto solve the difficulties. Finally, during the currency of an agreement, theExecutive would present to the individual commodity organisations those wider considerations of general economic policy of which the experts in particular commodities might not be aware.68. The other delegations adopted broadly similar attitudes. TheCanadian representatives emphasised that while favourable reports by theorganisation on schemes need not come, except formally, before the representativeGeneral Council, it was essential that disapproving reports should come beforethe General Council. The South African representatives also stressed the point that there should be the closest collaboration between the General Executive andthe individual commodity organisations but that the Executive should have no powers to veto the decisions of individual commodity controls or to interferewith their day-to-day working.69. It was generally agreed that, in order to ensure the rapidity of action necessary in some situations, e.g., when the position of any commodity was deteriorating very rapidly, the General Commodity Council should delegate tothe General Executive certain of its powers, but no attempt- was made to
determine the precise extent of this devolution. The Canadian representativessuggested that the need for emergency decisions might be met by a StandingCommittee of the General Council.70. From these discussions a common conception has emerged of the inter-national commodity organisation and the following redraft of Section II of the agreed Anglo-American Document is suggested as expressing this conceptionmore accurately than the existing text. It must not, however, be taken for granted that the change in the attitude of the United States officials, referred toin paragraph 4 above, has been so great as to make it certain that this redraftwill be acceptable to them.II. International Commodity Organisation.1. For the purpose of safeguarding and promoting the application ofthe agreed principles of international commodity policy,. an international commodity Organisation should be established, and should be open toaccession by all States.(l)2. The Organisation should be closely associated with other inter-national agencies in the field of commercial policy, currency, investment, &amp;c.Since it would inevitably be concerned with a number of agricultural products, it would be of particular importance that a very close liaisonshould be established between it and the Organisation for Food and agriculture; for instance, it might well be appropriate for a nominee ofthat body to serve on the Executive of the International CommodityOrganisation.3. The International Commodity Organisation would be responsible for examining international commodity arrangements of all kinds, both thosewhich may be in existence at the time of its establishment and those whoseformation may be proposed thereafter. All member States would undertakethat, any such arrangement into which they or their nationals propose toenter, or have already entered before the establishment of the Organisation,will be communicated in full detail to the Organisation for review and report.4. It would also be within the competence of the Organisation to takethe initiative in inviting and assisting Governments to promote the forma-tion of such arrangements in any case in which such a course.seemed to itdesirable.5. The following would be fundamental conditions of any such arrange-ment with respect to a particular commodity : (i) that participation in it should be open to any country having asubstantial interest in the commodity, whether as producer orconsumer;(ii) that on  the  body  administering  the  arrangement  importing countries should have a combined voting power equal to that ofthe exporting countries;(iii) that this body should contain one or more independent members appointed by the International Commodity Organisation.6. All bodies administering particular commodity arrangements would submit to the Organisation periodical reports on their operations. Inaddition to the initial examination mentioned in paragraph 3, the Organisa-tion would be responsible for keeping all such arrangements under continuous review, for the purpose (i) of making representations and recommendations to the bodiesadministering them and to the Governments interested in them,(ii) of issuing periodical reports as to how far they were continuing to operate  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  principles  of  theOrganisation and were succeeding in.attaining their objectives.(J) There may have to be agreed provisions indicating the terms upon which States shouldbe allowed to join the Organisation. The conditions upon which ex-enemy States should be obliged or allowed to join would need special consideration.[27117] d
7. The governing body of the International. Commodity organisation would be a General Council representative of all member States. It is forconsideration whether this body should not be identical with the general council administering the convention on commercial policy. In respect ofcommodity policy the Council would act through a small Executive appointed on grounds of their competence to appraise the operations of the bodiesadministering particular commodity arrangements. In order to ensure con-discontinuity and rapidity of action the Council would ordinarily delegate to thisExecutive a considerable measure of its functions and powers.71. This suggested redraft was generally approved with the exception ofparagraph 5 (iii). On this point, while there was agreement that persons otherthan representatives of producers and consumers should be present at the deliberations of the individual commodity organisations, there was a difference of opinion on the question whether they should be given voting powers. Therepresentatives of the United Kingdom, Canada, South Africa and New Zealandconsidered that they should be full members with voting powers. The representa-tives of Australia and India thought they should be present in a purely advisory capacity.72. The New Zealand representatives thought that inequitable results would follow if the term &quot; commodity &quot; and the rules formulated in respect thereto were confined to primary products as distinct from products bought by primary-producing countries; and urged that the possible application of similar rules should be examined in relation to Cartel Policy.Section III. Methods of International Commodity Policy.Buffer Stock Arrangements.73. In the discussion of this subject the United Kingdom representativesstressed their view that buffer stock arrangements and quantitative regulationwere not mutually exclusive but that buffer,stocks would be of value even in caseswhere recourse might have to be had to quantitative regulation; since a bufferstock scheme would both help to show whether such regulation was necessary,and, if it was necessary, would provide data which would enable it to be worked in a reasonable manner. It would also moderate short-term price fluctuations,and help to damp down the credit cycle by steadying the incomes of primaryproducers.74. There was general- agreement that, when a buffer stock is notaccompanied by quantitative regulation, the authority operating it should adjust the basic price in conformity with long-term changes in conditions of productionand demand. The United Kingdom representatives raised the question how7far, in practice, the buffer stock authority would have sufficient immunity from political pressure to operate on this principle. They pointed out that there was a school of thought which felt that political pressure would force buffer stockauthorities to maintain too high a price, particularly when the long-termtendency of the particular commodity price was to fall; that the buffer stockwould therefore be swamped, and forced to resort to measures of quantitative .restriction which, whatever the formal provisions for adjustment of quotas,would, in practice, stereotype the status quo in the interests of high costproducers.75. This danger was discussed at length and the general feeling of theDominion representatives was that political influences need not frustrate theworking of buffer stocks, and that the provision for adjustment in favour of low-cost producers in any schemes of quantitative regulation would, in fact,stand up to pressure. In the opinion of the Canadian representatives, a bufferstock would have a reasonable chance of pursuing a sensible price policy, i.e., of adjusting its price to conform with the equilibrium price as this was revealedin the movement of the commodity in and out of the buffer stock. They pointedout that there would be strong pressure after the war for forms of quantitative regulation from countries faced with problems of adjustment so great that they wished to make them by some other means than price; but they emphasised that,the dangers of such pressure would be lessened rather than aggravated by theexistence of buffer stocks. The representatives of Australia and South Africathought that the representatives of importers on the individual commodityorganisations, together with the representatives of low-cost producers, wouldsteer schemes away from policies of unduly high prices.
76. The Committee had before it a paper by Lord Keynes on the finance of buffer stocks. Discussion took place both on the general proposition that suchstocks should be financed centrally through the International CommodityOrganisation, and on the particular technical methods proposed by Lord Keynes.It was agreed that the whole question of finance required further study,particularly in connection with the proposals for an international bank.Quantitative Regulation Arrangements.77. The Committee discussed the practical provision which could be madefor the facilitation of orderly change during the currency of a regulation scheme.The United Kingdom representatives were in favour of provision, in a regula-tion scheme, for a plan of defined increases and decreases of basic quotas to operate at specified times within the currency of the scheme. The indian representatives agreed that, regulation schemes should not impede necessaryadjustment but said that, in their view, adjustment of basic quotas could not, inpractice, take place within the term of an agreement but only on renewal.78. The Committee gave general approval to the principles set out inSection III, 2 (c), amended to take account of the suggested redraft of Section II.It was suggested that this paragraph read as follows : It is agreed that in all cases international arrangements involvingquantitative regulation of exports and/or production should be subject tothe observance of certain principles in order to. ensure that the fundamentalobjectives of international commodity policy are not infringed. these principles include -(1) When any existing or proposed scheme of quantitative regulation(other than the putting into force of agreed provisional exportquotas which may be permissible under a particular buffer stockplan) is put before the International Commodity organisation for review and report, - the Organisation, before expressingapproval of the scheme, shall explore (in so far as it has not already done so) the possibility of dealing with the root causes ofthe disequilibrium between supply and demand which has led tothe formulation of the scheme.(2) Specific provision must be made in connection with any schemeinvolving quantitative regulation for ensuring that there are increasing opportunities (which should be applied as far aspossible during the period of the scheme) of supplying worldrequirements from countries able to furnish such requirementsmost effectively, with appropriate adjustments in prices to changes in the basic conditions of production and demand, andfor measures designed to facilitate these purposes.(3) No scheme of quantitative regulation should be framed to extend fora period of more than five years. If proposals are made for itsrenewal, the International Commodity Organisation should prepare and publish a report, showing, in particular, how far theprinciples in (2) above have been observed during the initial period of operation.Section IV. Subsidies.79. The Agreed Anglo-American Statement contained a Section onsubsidies, but it was agreed at the first meeting of the Committee that this subject would be more appropriately considered in the discussions on commercial policy.Conclusion.80. It was agreed that the Anglo-American Document as amended formed a suitable basis for further discussion with the United States officials.IV.-CARTEL POLICY,81. United Kingdom, Dominion and Indian officials have examined the suggestions of United States officials for controlling the activities of international,cartels. The United States proposals, which United Kingdom officials undertook to consider, were, briefly, to the effect that all private international agreements: . [27117] &apos; d 2
establishing enduring relationships between business enterprises should be registered with Governments; that a list of nine common cartel practices shouldbe forbidden as subjects of private international agreements; that where such restrictions are desirable they should be imposed by inter-governmental agree-ments; and that there should be international conventions relating to corporation,patent and trade-mark law. Similar proposals were .put forward by UnitedStates to Canadian officials.82. Some consideration has been given by United Kingdom, Dominion and indian officials to various methods of controlling international cartels, and of limiting their more undesirable features. Three methods of doing so havereceived examination : r(i) The procedure whereby enquiries are conducted when complaints aremade about particular activities of combines or cartels. this procedure has already been adopted in certain of the Dominions but has usually not been found to be very effective,(ii) Registration of cartel arrangements by the Governments of the countries whose nationals make them, as a supplement to the procedure under(i) above. Registration is generally considered to be desirable,provided that workable definitions of cartel arrangements can.befound. The act of registration would imply neither approval nordisapproval. The question would then arise as to the use which shouldbe made of the information obtained by means of registration.Pending experience of this procedure, United Kingdom officials would prefer not to publish, or to communicate piecemeal to other Govern-ments, the information obtained from registration in the UnitedKingdom; they would rather wait until they are in a position toprepare a general report on the information obtained by registration,and to recommend a policy towards international cartels in the lightof ascertained facts. Most of the Dominion officials, on the otherhand, feel that unless Governments are willing to communicate toone another information that they obtain by means of registration,the Governments of countries affected by cartel arrangements, towhich their nationals are not parties, will often remain in ignorance of the existence of such arrangements, and will be unable to take appropriate domestic measures to deal with their effects. Further,in many such instances, domestic measures could not reach the partiesto an offending arrangement,(iii) The prohibition of a list of cartel practices. It is generally agreed thatit is the abuse, and not the existence, of the nine cartel practices listedby United States officials that is injurious, and that the prohibitionof all of them would be impracticable and undesirable. On the otherhand, Dominion and Indian officials point out that at least some ofthese restrictive practices, where necessary, are more properly the subjects of inter-governmental than of private agreements. Further,they express doubt whether registration would, in itself, prove anadequate deterrent, and suggest that positive action, as, for instance,to prohibit the allocation of territorial markets by private agreement,may be required. The United Kingdom officials point out that a vetoon territorial allocation, if effective, would impede the interchange of information on research, and would tend to cause waste byduplicating channels of distribution. Australian and South Africanofficials think that, if concerns in highly industrialised countries areforbidden to conclude agreements with firms in less developed countries for the use of patents under licences /which restrict that use to production for the domestic market, the growth of secondary industries in undeveloped countries may be hampered.83. It is the general view that the United States authorities attach greatimportance to controlling the activities of cartels as part of the general arrange-ments for giving effect to Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement, and, thattheir willingness to be co-operative in other important matters, such as monetary,commercial and commodity policy, may be greatly influenced by the british attitude towards cartels. United Kingdom officials consider that the requirement of registration of cartel agreements would represent a considerable step forward in all countries that have not developed a cartel policy to the same extent as theUnited States.  The need to register would in itself impose a check on detrimental
activities, but it is necessary to obtain a greater knowledge of the facts before deciding what further action should be taken. Officials of some of the delegationsincline to the view that business organisations should be prevented from makinginternational agreements without the knowledge, and perhaps contrary to the policies, of Governments. They also feel that registration of cartel arrangementsby countries whose nationals make them, unaccompanied by provisions for the communication of information to other countries affected by such arrangements,would not be an adequate solution of the problem. Those holding this viewrecognise the difficulties that would be involved in the prohibition of a list ofcartel practices, but they suggest, as a minimum, that all relevant information obtained through national registration should be communicated to Governmentsof countries affected by the private agreements, and that further consideration should be given to the possibility of prohibiting one or two types of cartelpractices. Finally, there is a general feeling that there is substance in the UnitedStates contention that cartel agreements tend to run counter to the other post-war economic plans under consideration, because such agreements are restrictive ratherthan expansionist in character, because, unlike the arrangements proposed inrespect of commodity policy, they contain no provision for the representation of consumers, and because there is no provision for review by Governments in thelight of an internationally agreed code.V. -EMPLOYMENT POLICY.84. Discussion between United Kingdom and United States officials in washington about the maintenance of a high level of employment was largelyconfined to the question of devising arrangements for the co-ordination of theactivities of the specialised international economic organisations, both existing and projected, which were expected to be in operation after the war. dominion and Indian officials recognise that the monetary, commercial and commodity policy proposals at present under discussion will be of considerable assistancein securing and maintaining a high level of employment, and that the co-ordina-tion of the activities of the proposed international bodies in these fields will benecessary. They think, however, that it would be premature to consider indetail how that co-ordination could best be effected.85. The Australian officials have emphasised that the monetary, commercial and commodity proposals would be more likely to achieve their objectives, andto be generally accepted, if Governments would specifically accept an obligationto pursue policies designed to secure and maintain high levels of employment.They have, therefore, submitted for consideration a draft International Employ -ment Agreement, the signature of which would, in their view, have a beneficialinfluence upon the policies adopted by Governments, and would help to mobilisepublic opinion in support of the other schemes under consideration.86. Officials of the United Kingdom, the other Dominions and India agreethat high levels of employment and the maintenance and improvement of standards of living should be the main objectives of post-war economic policy.They agree that Governments would be more ready to undertake the obligationsthat would be involved by acceptance of the monetary, commercial, commodityand other proposals, if they could be assured that other Governments wouldpursue policies leading to active employment. They therefore welcome theAustralian proposal for an International Agreement, wherein each Governmentwould specifically pledge itself to take all measures within its power to maintainactive employment. They consider, however, that opinion has not yet developed to a point at which it would be reasonable to expect Governments, either tosubmit to the judgment of an international tribunal upon the efficacy of their employment policies, or to impose sanctions if the obligation to maintain employ-ment was not fulfilled.&apos; 87. The draft International Employment Agreement, as amended after discussion, appears as Annex K to this report. United Kingdom, Dominion and indian officials agree that, subject to. the approval of Ministers, this draft should be put forward to the United States authorities as an essential and central part of the arrangements for implementing Article VII of the mutual aid Agreement and the Atlantic Charter.
The Proposal for an International Monetary Fund.Statement of Principles as Revised at 1st March, 1944.Joint Statement by Experts op United andAssociated Nations on the Establishment of anInternational Monetary Fund.Sufficient discussion of the problems of international monetary co-operation has taken place at the technicallevel to justify a statement of principles. The experts of the United and Associated Nations who haveparticipated in these discussions are of the opinionthat the most practical method of assuring inter-national monetary co-operation is through the estab-lishment of an International Monetary Fund. Theyhave set forth below the principles which they believeshould be the basis for this Fund. Governments arenot asked to give final approval to these principlesuntil they have been embodied in the form ofdefinitive proposals by the delegates of the Unitedand Associated Nations meeting in a formalconference.1. Preamble.The International Monetary Fund is designed as apermanent institution for international monetaryco-operation. The Fund is intended to facilitate thebalanced growth of international trade and to contri-bute in this way to the maintenance of a high levelof employment. The Fund is expected to provide themachinery for consultation on international monetaryproblems. The resources of the Fund would beavailable under adequate safeguards to help member countries to maintain exchange stability while giving them time to correct maladjustments in their balanceof payments without resorting to measures destructiveto national or international prosperity.2. Purposes of the Fund.(i) To promote exchange stability, to maintainorderly exchange arrangements among member countries and to avoid competitive exchange depreciation.(ii) To assure multilateral payments facilities on current transactions among member countries and tohelp eliminate foreign exchange restrictions thathamper the growth of world trade.(iii) To shorten the period and lessen the degree ofdisequilibrium in the international balance of payments of member countries.(iv) To give confidence to member countries by theprovision of actual &apos;ahd potential support in the attainment of. these purposes.3. Subscription to the Fund.&apos; (i) Member countries shall subscribe in gold and intheir local funds amounts (quotas) determined by a formula to be agreed, which will amount altogether toabout $8 billion if all the United Nations and thecountries associated with them subscribe to the Fund(corresponding to about $10 billion for the world asa whole).(ii) The obligatory gold subscription of a member country shall be fixed at 25 per cent, of its subscriptions-tion (quota) or 10 per cent, of its holdings of gold and gold-convertible exchange, whichever is thesmaller. The amount of the holdings of gold andgold-convertible currency for the purposes of thisclause and clause 4 (viii) below shall be determinedby agreement between each member country and theFund.4. Transactions with the Fund.(i) Member countries shall deal with the Fund only through their Treasury, Central Bank, StabilisationFund, or other fiscal agencies.   The Fund&apos;s account in a member&apos;s currency shall be kept at the central bank of the member country.(ii) A member shall be entitled to buy another member&apos;s currency from the Fund in exchange for itsown currency, provided that  ^(a) the   member   represents   that   the   currency&apos;demanded is presently needed for making pay-ments in that currency which are consistent with the purposes of the Fund;(fo) the Fund has not given notice that its-holdings of the currency demanded have becomescarce, in which case the provisions of 7 belowcome into force;(c) the Fund &apos;s total holdings of the currency offeredhave not increased by more than 25 per cent,of the member&apos;s quota during the previoustwelve months, and do not exceed 200 percent, of the quota;(d) the Fund has not previously given appropriatenotice that the member is ^suspended from making further use of the Fund&apos;s resources onthe ground that it is making use of them in a manner contrary to the purposes and policyof the Fund; and(e) the Fund may in its discretion and on conditionswhich safeguard its interests waive any of theconditions above.(iii) Subject to (iv) below, operations on the Fund&apos;s account will be limited to transactions for the purposeof supplying a member country, on the member&apos;sinitiative and subject to the provisions of (ii) above,with another member&apos;s currency in exchange for itsown currency or for gold.(iv) The Fund will be entitled at its option, with aview to-preventing a particular member&apos;s currencyfrom becoming .&apos;&apos; scarce &apos;&apos; (a) to borrow its currency from a member country;(6) to offer gold to a member country in exchange for its currency.(v) So long as a member country is entitled to buyanother member&apos;s currency from the Fund in exchange for its own currency, it shall be prepared to buy its owncurrency from that member with , that member&apos;scurrency or with gold. This shall not apply to currencysubject to restrictions in conformity with 10 (iii) belowor to holdings of currency which have accumulated as aresult of transactions of a current account natureeffected before the removal by the member country of restrictions on multilateral clearing maintained orimposed under 11 (ii) below.(vi) A member country desiring to obtain, directly or indirectly, the currency of another member countryfor gold is. expected, provided it can do so with equaladvantage, to acquire the currency by the sale of gold to the Fund. . This shall not preclude the sale of newlymined gold by a gold producing country on any market.(vii) A member country may repurchase from theFund for gold any part of the latter&apos;s holdings of itSfcurrency.(viii) So long as a member&apos;s holdings of gold andgold-convertible exchange exceed its quota the Fund,in selling foreign exchange to that country, shall require that one-half of the net sales of such exchangeduring the Fund&apos;s financial year be paid for with gold.Furthermore, if at the end of the year a member&apos;sholdings of gold and gold-convertible exchange haveincreased, the Fund may require up to half of theincrease to be used to repurchase part of the Fund&apos;sholdings of its currency, so&apos; long as this does not reduce the Fund&apos;s holdings of a member&apos;s currencybelow 75 per cent, of its quota, or the member&apos;sANNEX A.Monetary Policy.
laholdings of gold and gold-convertible exchange belowits quota.5. Par Values of Member Currencies.(i) The par value of a member&apos;s currency shall beagreed with the Fund when it is admitted to member-ship, and shall be expressed in terms of gold. Alltransactions between the Fund and members shall beat par, subject to a fixed charge payable by the member making application to the Fund, and all trans-actions in member currencies shall be at rates within an agreed percentage of parity.ytei(ii) Subject to (v) below, no change in the par valueCi&apos; a member&apos;s currency shall be made by the Fundwithout the country&apos;s approval. Member countriesagree not to propose a change in the parity of their currencies unless they consider it appropriate to thecorrection of a fundamental disequilibrium. Changesshall be made only with the approval of the Fund,subject to the provisions below.(iii) The Fund shall approve a requested change inthe par value of a member&apos;s currency, if it is essentialto the correction of a fundamental disequilibrium. Inparticular, the Fund shall not reject a requestedchange, necessary to restore equilibrium, because ofthe domestic social or political policies of the countryapplying for a change. In considering a requestedchange, the Fund shall take into consideration theextreme uncertainties prevailing at the time theparities of member countries were initially agreed upon.&apos;(iv) After consulting the Fund, a member country may change the established parity of its currency,provided the proposed change, inclusive of any previous change since the establishment of the Fund,does not exceed 10 per cent. In the case of applica-tion for a further change, not covered by the above and not exceeding 10 per cent., the Fund shall give its decision within two days of receiving the application,if the applicant so requests.(v) Provision shall be made for an agreed uniformchange in the gold value of currencies. Notwith-standing 8 (iii) below, such a change shall require theapproval of all member countries with 10 per cent, ormore of the aggregate quotas.6. Capital Transactions.(i) A member country may not use the Fund&apos;resources to meet a large or sustained outflow of-capital, and the Fund may require a member countryto exercise controls to prevent such use of the resourcesof the Fund. This provision is not intended to preventthe use of the Fund&apos;s resources for capital transactionsof reasonable amount required for the expansion of exports or in the ordinary course of trade, banking orother business. Nor is it intended to prevent capital movements which are met out of a member country&apos;sown resources of gold -and foreign exchange, providedsuch capital movements are in accordance with thepurposes of the Fund.(ii) Subject to 7 below, a member country may not use its control of capital movements to -restrict pay-ments for current transactions or to delay unduly thetransfer of funds in settlement of commitments.7. Apportionment of Scarce Currencies.(i) When it becomes evident to the Fund that thed2fQand for a member country&apos;s currency may sooneSiaust the Fund&apos;s holdings of that- currency, theFund shall so inform member countries and propose an&apos; equitable method of apportioning the scarce currency. When a currency is thus declared scarce,the Fund shall issue a report embodying the causes ofthe scarcity and containing recommendations designedto bring it to an end.(ii) A decision by the Fund to apportion a scarce currency shall operate as.an authorisation to a member country, after consultation with the Fund, temporarilyto restrict the freedom of exchange operations in&apos; theaffected currency, and in determining the manner of restricting the demand and rationing the limited supplyamong its nationals the member country shall have complete jurisdiction.8. Management.(i) The Fund shall be managed by a Board of directors and Executive Committee representing themembers.(ii) The distribution of basic voting power shall be closely related to quotas, but no member shall beentitled to cast more than one-fifth of the aggregatevotes.(iii) All matters shall be settled by majority, exceptthat a change in the basis of determining quotasshall require a four-fifths vote, and no member&apos;s quotamay be changed without its assent.9. Withdrawal.(i) A member country may withdraw from the Fundby giving notice in writing.(ii) The reciprocal obligations of the Fund and thecountry are to be liquidated within a reasonable time.(iii) After a member country has given notice inwriting of its withdrawal from the Fund, the Fundmay not dispose of its holdings of the country&apos;scurrency except in accordance with the arrangementsmade under (ii) above. After a country has given notice of withdrawal, its right to utilise the resourcesof the Fund is subject to the approval of the Fund.10. Obligations of Member Countries.(i) Not to buy gold at a price above the parity of its currency, nor to sell gold at a price below the parity of its currency.(ii) Not to allow exchange transactions in itsmarkets in the currencies of other members at ratesoutside a prescribed ran^e. based on the agreed&quot;parities.(iii) Not to impose restrictions on payments -for current international transactions with other member countries (other than those involving capital transfersor in accordance with 7 above) or to engage in anydiscriminatory currency arrangements- or multiplecurrency practices without the approval of the Fund..11. Transitional Arrangements.(i) Since the Fund is not intended to provide facilities for relief or reconstruction or to deal with international indebtedness arising out of the war, theagreement of a member country to provisions 4 (v) &apos;and 10 (iii) above shall not become operative until itis satisfied as to the arrangements at its disposal tofacilitate the settlement of balance of paymentsdifferences during the early post-war transitional period by means which will not unduly encumber itsfacilities with the Fund.(ii) During this transition period member countries may maintain and adapt to changing circumstancesexchange regulations of the character which havebeen in operation during the war, but they shall under-take to withdraw as soon as possible by progressivestages any restrictions which impede multilateralclearing on current account. In their exchange policy they shall pay continuous regard to the principles and objectives of the Fund; and they shall take allpossible measures to develop commercial and financial relations with other member countries which will facilitate international payments and the maintenanceof exchange stability.(iii) The Fund may make representations to anymember that conditions are favourable to the with-drawSl of particular restrictions or for the generalabandonment of restrictions inconsistent with 10 (iii)above. Not later than three years from the cominginto force of the Fund, any member still retainingany restrictions inconsistent with 10 (iii) shall consult with the Fund as to their further retention.(iv) In its relations with member, countries, theFund shall recognise that the transition period is oneof change and adjustment, and in deciding on its attitude to any proposals presented by members itshall give, the member country the benefit of any reasonable doubt.
ANNEX B.Monetary Policy..  Suggested Textual Amendments of the Statement of Principles.At the discussions between the United Kingdom experts and those of theDominions and India the following suggestions for redrafting the Statement of principles on the Establishment of an International Monetary Fund foundgeneral favour : -I. It is not clear what distinction is intended between the matters touched on in the Preamble and those covered by the Purposes of the Fund. The formershould have no less authority than the latter. It is suggested, therefore, that theyshould be combined and the opportunity of a redraft should be taken to emphasisestill further certain principles of particular importance. The revised versionmight run as follows : *&quot; 1. The Purposes and Policy of the Fund.(i) The International Monetary Fund is designed as a permanentinstitution for international monetary co-operation.(ii) It is expected to provide the machinery for consultation on inter-national monetary problems.(iii) It is intended to contribute to the maintenance of a high level.ofemployment by facilitating the expansion and balanced growth of inter-national trade, and to aid by such means domestic policies directed towards this purpose whilst discouraging any proposals of a contrary tendency.(iv) It will be the duty of the Fund to make its resources available to member countries under adequate safeguards so as to give them time to correct maladjustments in their balance of payments and, where necessary,to make orderly changes in exchange-rates, thus avoiding competitiveexchange depreciations and promoting exchange stability, without resort to measures destructive of national or international prosperity.(v) It is an object of the Fund to help eliminate such foreign exchange restrictions as hamper the growth of world trade.(vi) It is the hope of the Fund by these means (a) to assure multilateral payments facilities for all current transactionsbetween member countries;(6) to shorten the period and lessen the degree of disequilibrium in theinternational balance of payments of member countries;(c) to give confidence to member countries by the provision of actual and potential support in the attainment of these ends.&quot;II. The Committee on Monetary Policy prefer a table of quotas which isstated to have been compiled on the basis of certain general principles rather thanby the application of a published formula. A precise formula is exposed to the objection that no single formula will produce an all-round satisfactory result,and also to the difficulty that its statistical basis will be open to much doubt andcontroversy in particular cases. Broadly speaking, it was felt that the table ofactual quotas proposed by the United States Treasury would meet the case exceptfor the smaller countries where, in some instances, it was clearly too small to suit the circumstances. If, however, quotas of less than $200 million in theUnited States table were to be doubled, with an adjustment for those with lessthan $400 million, a not unsatisfactory result would be reached. The view was expressed that the resulting addition of some $1,300 million did not lead to an aggregate of quotas out of proper relation to the individual quotas, andparticularly to the American quota, and it Avas much hoped that the United states treasury would feel able to accept this addition.Clause 3 (i) of the Statement of Principles might then run : &quot;3 (i) Member countries shall subscribe in gold or in their local fundsamounts (quotas) determined with regard to the circumstances and resourcesof each country and the part which it plays in international trade, as setforth in detail for each of the United Nations and the countries associatedwith them in the table attached as an Appendix.&quot;
VI. Clause 4 (ii) (e) might express its intention more clearly if thewing words were added at the end  4 (ii) (e) . ...&quot; to the advantage of a member.&quot;VII. Precise drafting requires that the opening words of Clause 4 (iii)should read : &quot; 4 (iii) Subject to (iv) and (vii) belowVIII. It is felt that it would.be useful to include in the text of Clause 8some indication that the day-to-day management of the Fund would beexercised not by the general Council, whose functions are to determine broadgeneral principles for the conduct of the Fund and of members, but by the smallerexecutive organ. The following revised version of Clause 8 (i) is, therefore,suggested : &quot; 8 (i) The Fund shall be governed by a Council of Directors representingthe members and by a Board of Management, chosen on account of their personal and technical qualifications, to whom the Council may delegate anyof its powers and functions.&quot;Similarly it is thought that it would be helpful to include a specific statement as to the duty of the Fund to publish frequent statistics of its position. Thefollowing addition to the Clause is therefore suggested : &quot; 8 (iv) The Management should publish at short intervals a statementof the Fund&apos;s position, showing the extent of its holdings of members&apos;currencies and of gold, and. sales of gold.&quot;[27117] BAnnex B contains a table of quotas revised in accordance with the formulasuggested above, together with certain reservations.III. Some provision such as the following should be made for clarity&apos;s sakein Clause 3 for a subsequent change in quotas which is at present only referredto indirectly in Clause 8 (iii) :-&quot;3 (ii) The table of quotas may be revised from time to time, but changesshall require a four-fifths vote and no meniber&apos;s quota may be changedwithout its assent.&quot;41 Clause 3 (ii) should then be renumbered 3 (iii), and Clause 8 (iii) mightread :-&quot; 8 (iii) Subject to 3 (ii) above, all matters shall be settled by majority.&quot;IV. In Clause 4 (ii) (c) it would be logical to provide that the first limitingprovision of this clause should only begin to apply after the Fund&apos;s holdings ofa member&apos;s currency have begun to exceed its quota. The following re-draftwould do what is necessary : &quot; 4 (ii) (c) The Fund&apos;s total holdings of the currency offered have not, ifthey exceed 125 per cent, of the member&apos;s quota, increased by more than25 per cent, of the quota during the previous twelve months, and do notexceed 200 per cent, of the quota.&quot;    -In the view of the Australian delegation the permissible percentage increase would need to be 33 to meet the minimum requirements of those countries likeAustralia, whose international receipts fluctuate widely from year to year becauseof seasonal and market conditions. If it is not desired to make this higherpercentage general the Australian delegation suggested that it might be restricted to countries whose holdings of gold and free exchange on joining the Fund were. low until such time as they had built up these holdings to 50 per cent, oftheir quota.V. The Committee feel that the provisions of Clause 4 (ii) (d) should notapply until the Fund has made a report and given the member an opportunity tomend its ways, and that this requirement would probably be along the line of thought of the United States Treasury. This might be effected by the followingaddition at the end of&apos; the sub-clause : 4 (ii) (d) .... &quot; but the Fund shall not give such notice until it haspresented to the member concerned a report setting out its views and hasallowed a suitable time for a reply.&quot;
IX. It is felt that the present wording of Clause 10 (i) imposes an unnecessary degree of rigidity on transactions between member countries, and does not take account of customary margins to cover costs of transport, &amp;c. Thesub-clause would allow sufficient flexibility and would correspond more closely to clause 10 (ii) if it read as follows : &quot; (i) Not to buy gold at a price which exceeds the agreed parity of its currency by more than a prescribed margin, and not to sell gold at a price which falls below the agreed parity by more than a prescribed margin.&quot;ANNEX C.Monetary Policy.Revision of Quotas suggested as a basis for further discussion.U.S. RevisedProposal.

ANNEX D.Monetary Policy.The International Monetary Fund and the Transition Period.Extract from a letter dated 19th December, 1943, from Lord Keynes to Dr. White(United States Treasury).We are naturally beginning to give close attention to what arrangementswe can best make to meet our external payments in the immediate post-war periodof uncertain duration which, provisionally, we think of as being (say) three years.This will be a period of demobilisation and change over to peace-time production,when abnormal British Government expenditure overseas currently incurred, orcurrently brought to account, will remain on a large scale, whereas British exportscannot yet be raised, to their full post-war volume. In these circumstances our balance of payments on current account can only come to something likeequilibrium rather gradually.It seems to us to be virtually certain that our accumulating deficiency duringthis period will arise in conditions, and reach an order of magnitude, that are outside the true scope of the new institution. Indeed the institution might findits future usefulness and strength greatly impaired if it were to attempt to handle such problems.The conditions will be a sequel to the war and the deficiency will in fact be adelayed instalment of the costs of the war and should be handled as a part ofwar-time finance and not regarded as belonging to a subsequent peace-time regime.But, this being so, it is most important that there should be no misunderstandingbetween us as to how we contemplate handling our problem in this period.We have not as yet any cut-and-dried plan and are not likely to be in aposition to have one much in advance of putting it into operation. Owing tothis uncertainty we have to retain a somewhat wider latitude of action than mayactually be required in practice. But it may make clearer the implications of clause 11 (ii) in our revised draft, as we see them, if I illustrate the system ofarrangements which we should, consider ourselves free to adopt under it duringthe interim period in question.This clause, as we intend it, would allow us, not only to maintain the sterling area arrangements and payments agreements with other countries of the general character now in force, but to adapt and extend these as, for example,by instituting a payments agreement with any part of the sterling area withwhich we could not reach an alternative satisfactory arrangement. It would alsoallow us to make new inter-Government or inter-Central Bank credit and other arrangements on the model, for example, of the recent Belgo-Dutch agreementor of our own Anglo-French agreement.Our object in all this would not be to move away from the objective ofmultilateral clearing in the direction of bilateralism. On the contrary, we should endeavour so to operate the arrangements as to move as far and as rapidly inthe direction of multilateral clearing as was compatible with our way meanwhileand maintaining the stability of our international monetary relations. nor should we ask during the transitional period for any modification of the normalarrangements of the Plan for altering exchange rates, apart from the special provision about &quot; reasonable doubt &quot; already discussed.We have, therefore, given much thought to drafting our proposals for the transition in a way that will derogate to the least possible extent .from theultimate purposes and policies of the Plan. We think that this object is bestattained by collecting into one clause all the special arrangements relating tothis period. This allows the Plan for the normal period to be stated morecategorically, particularly, for example, in clause 10 (iii). Furthermore,clause 11 (ii) is so expressed as to emphasise the nature of the ultimate goal andthe obligation to approach it as rapidly as possible; whilst clause 11 (iii) reservesthe position of the Union in the event of its appearing that some member is taking advantage of 11 (ii) for an undue and unjustifiable prolongation of restrictions.11 (i) is to allow prospective members as much opportunity as possible tosee their way through the transitional period before finally undertaking theobligations of membership.  This has the advantage of emphasising the fact that[27117] e 2
it is not part of the purpose of the new institution to finance relief or reconstruc-tion, thus avoiding a misunderstanding which has been the source of much outsidecriticism, particularly, as I found during my visit there, in New York.We believe that the greater clarity, which the proposed clause 11 will bring to the understanding of the relation of the Plan to the transitional period, wouldbe a source of comfort to a number of countries contemplating membership, andwould protect the Plan as a whole from much misdirected criticism.ANNEX E.Monetary Policy.Suggested Lines of Reply to the United States Proposals for a United NationsReconstruction Bank.1. We do not want to express our criticisms to the United States treasury in a way which is non-co-operative or obstructive. We feel very strongly indeedthat loans from creditor countries to debtor countries in the early post-war periodare essential to avoid widespread economic chaos and much needless humansuffering. Without them no International Monetary Plan can have a fair startand the reduction of barriers to trade will be frustrated by acute balance of payment difficulties.2. But it is essential that the loans made should be such as will achieve thepurpose desired. Any loans, supported by an international institution, shouldsatisfy the two conditions (i) that the proceeds of the loan should be free exchange available to the borrower to expand in any market for requirements arising out of the project under finance, whether the primary expenditure is inside or outside the borrowing country; and(ii) that no country should be obligated to subscribe, directly or indirectly,to such loans unless its monetary authority has approved such sub-scription as being within the capacity of the country&apos;s balance ofpayments at the time when it has to be made.3. It follows that each individual loan, approved by such an institution,must be actually subscribed by the Government or in the market of the lendingcountry after any necessary approval from the monetary authority. The part tobe played by the international institution should be primarily concerned with thetwo functions following : *(i) The expert examination of projects for international loans for which aguarantee by the United Nations Bank has been or might appro-appropriately be sought, with regard to the degree of priority which shouldbe accorded to each of such projects, to the reliability and technicalcapacity of those who would handle it, and to the prospects of servicingit in free exchange;(ii) the guaranteeing of the service of the loan out of an internationallysubscribed fund. If, even with the guarantee, a loan could not beraised at a low rate of interest on the market, it is important that theGovernment of the country by which the loan is to be made shoulditself make the loan (and obtain the benefit of the guarantee).4. The facilitation of suitable loans from creditor countries to countries in need of reconstruction and development is so much in the general interests of theworld economy and of equilibrium in the international balances of payment that countries which fall into neither of these two categories can reasonably be askedto contribute to the guarantee fund within the limits of their reasonable capacity.It is, however, important to ensure, so far as possible, that any calls on the guarantees shall be kept within as harrow limits as possible and should be spreadover as long a period as possible. For this reason it is suggested (i) that theservice of the loans should take the form of terminable annuities covering bothinterest and repayment of principal, so that, in the event of default, no large capital sum falls due for repayment but only the continuance of the annuities.;and (ii) that the institution should charge a substantial commission at a flat rate of (say) 1 per cent, per annum on all loans guaranteed by it, the accumulationsof which would be drawn upon before calling on guarantees.
5. It should be made clear that the institution would be concerned withloans for post-war reconstruction as well as for new development.6. It is felt that the first step must be to submit these essential principles tothe United States Treasury. Until the principles are agreed, we feel that itwould be a mistake to consider drafting amendments or detailed points, or toattempt to draw up the outlines of an alternative Plan. We feel&apos;that the bestconstructive contribution we can make to progress will be to set out the main principles which we regard as essential and to seek to obtain agreement on those principles.ANNEX F.Commercial Policy.Introductory Note.As has been stated on many occasions, the Government of the UnitedKingdom favours a commercial policy designed to promote general economic expansion and action directed towards the removal of the obstacles to inter-national trade, and is specially desirous to co-operate with the Government of theUnited States in joint endeavours to promote these aims. While, during the transitional period immediately after the war when we are seeking to restore our balance of trade, we may have to retain some special measures of control, we hopethat we and other countries will be able to emerge from this stage without undue delay. It is with this in mind, and as a contribution to the conversations on post-war economic reconstruction which we are about to undertake, that the UnitedKingdom Government submits for consideration the following points which forma practical approach to this problem, and which might prove suitable fordiscussion among the United Nations.The proposals of the United Kingdom Government involve the establishmentof a general code of rules for the regulation of international commercialbehaviour, and of an appropriate international institution. The ground coveredby this suggested code is somewhat wider than that which would be relevant to thediscussion of a normal bilateral trade agreement. This is not because the UnitedKingdom Government is unmindful of the importance of the method of bilateraltrade agreements or of the extent to which this method has- already contributed tothe clearance of the channels of trade, but rather because it is felt, that there arecertain problems which are less susceptible of treatment in this manner, whichnevertheless deserve consideration in the comprehensive review which we are about to make.(i) An international commercial policy capable of helping towards thesolution of the post-war economic and political problems would have tobe accompanied by international policies conducive to a high level ofemployment, production and consumption; to improved standards ofliving; and, in general, to an expansive world economy. It requiressome system for the free convertibility of currencies for tradingpurposes. Further, an essential condition of success is the develop-ment of effective political and strategic plans for the achievement of security,(ii) The policy should also be based on the assumption of a multilateralcommercial agreement, embracing as many countries as possible.Bilateral agreements by themselves, however advantageous, cannot inour view fully meet the needs of the general situation, whereas a multilateral agreement, laying down certain principles for the freerexchange of commodities, can be of great benefit. These considera-tions weigh particularly heavily for a country such as our own which,being dependent on imports for a large proportion of her food and rawmaterials, is especially interested in-the maintenance of an adequatevolume of exports. The multilateral convention would not, of course,exclude supplementary bilateral agreements within the framework ofthe multilateral agreement,(iii) The United Kingdom, both by tradition and by experience, regards anincreased freedom of trade as particularly in her interest. We shalljoin in any movement to secure it and, when it comes down to practice,we should have every motive to encourage it, both from our own point
of view and on account of the general international benefit^ our sympathy is entirely with those who are seeking to remove barriers totrade. Any qualifications we may have to make will be due to thespecial difficulties of the immediate post-war period and the present uncertainty as to what will, in fact, lie within our power and that ofother countries.(iv) We consider that the quantitative regulation of imports should notordinarily be employed for the primary purpose of protecting homeindustries, but rather regarded as a mechanism appropriate and useful for special purposes, including, among others, the safeguarding of a country&apos;s balance of payments. We suggest that common agreement might be reached concerning a more or less automatic and objectivetest of the conditions under which such action should be permissible;for example, it might be found that the statistics resulting from thecreation of an international monetary authority could be used for thispurpose.(v) Any multilateral commercial arrangement should be compatible with theconduct of external trade by the State, or by State-sponsored organisa-tions, as well as by private enterprise. But it would be desirable thatforms of trading promoted by State action should be conducted inaccordance with a code to be agreed.(vi) We should be prepared to agree to measures designed to prevent export subsidies.(vii) We would accept an upper limit of moderate height for tariffs for incorporation in a- multilateral agreement. The question should beconsidered whether special provisions could be devised to meet, on areasonable scale, the temporary needs of infant industries.(viii) We should be prepared to make all our arrangements, including&apos; particularly quantitative restriction of imports, on a basis of mutualnon-discrimination.   Preferences are dealt with in (ix).(ix) Quite apart from our own position, a general plan should leave room forspecial arrangements within political and geographical groups, since these are likely to be asked for and could be properly conceded in manycases. As part of a comprehensive scheme for the betterment of thetrade of the world as a whole, we should be prepared to play our full part in any general scheme for reducing preferences,(x) We believe that these points could best be covered by the formulation of ageneral commercial code to which all countries would be invited to subscribe, and by the establishment of an appropriate internationalinstitution. ;,\&apos;; VWashington, 17th September, 1943., ANNEX G.Commercial Policy.Illustrative Outline of Proposals.The following outline is put forward as an illustration of one way in whichthe principles suggested in the Introductory Note on Commercial Policy might beapplied in a general multilateral convention. Such a convention would establish a general code of rules for the regulation of international commercial behaviour,together with an appropriate international institution.A. Quantitative Import Restrictions.(i) Immediately after the war, there should be an initial period of, say,two years, during which it will be permissible for any Government tocontrol its imports by quantitative restrictions. During these twoyears, however, any country making use of such restrictions would be committed to consult with any country which considered that itsinterests were injured thereby, with a view to ensuring that,therestrictions were operated in an equitable and non-discriminatorymanner, and so to cause as little harm as possible to the supplying countries.   If agreement could not be reached in such consultations,
the Commercial Union (see section G below) would use its offices witha view to conciliation. In appropriate cases there should be consulta-tion, both during the initial period and subsequently, between theCommercial Union and the International Labour Organisation, whichis particularly well qualified to deal with international labour standards.(ii) Governments should undertake on joining the Commercial Union thatat the end of this two-year period they would remove their import restrictions by progressive steps over a period of, say, three years,except in the case of the categories mentioned below or other categoriesapproved by the Commercial Union. The approved categories would cover, in addition to the usual exceptions on grounds of health, &amp;c,action under the following heads : (a) In respect of recognised international commodity agreements andother special agreements affecting the production of and/or trade in particular commodities which may be reached between two or more Governments and approved by the commercial union;(6) On the ground of balance of payments difficulties. It might bepossible to devise a more or less automatic and objective test ofthe conditions under which action on these grounds should be permissible; and(c) Subject to the approval of the Commercial Union, in consultation as regards political aspects with any other appropriate international body, for the protection of industries necessary on grounds of security.Non-discrimination as between members of the Commercial Union,should be the aim in all action permitted under these categories.(iii) Exchange restrictions on current payments (as distinct from capital movements) should not be applied in a manner inconsistent with theabove-mentioned objectives.B. State Trading.(i) The multilateral commercial convention should be compatible with theconduct of external trade by the State or State-sponsored organisetions, as well as by private enterprise.(ii) The discriminatory misuse of State trading should be prevented by rulesbased generally on Article 8 of the United States-United kingdom trade Agreement of 1938. These might provide that State tradingmonopolies should be guided solely by economic considerations.(iii) State trading organisations should be permitted to make contracts forlonger periods than normal commercial consideration would dictate.Where buffer stock schemes exist, such contracts should be made only within the range of the buffer stock prices. For other commoditiesthe long-term contracts should, wherever possible, be thrown open to a form of international tender. The limitation on protection by meansof tariffs (see section D below) should provide a criterion for judgingwhether such purchases were excessively protective. The latterprovision is intended to refer primarily to State purchases for re-sale.Any such limitation would be difficult to impose in the case of Statepurchases for the Government&apos;s own use.(iv) Where a State trades through a monopoly, countries with which it dealsshould be allowed to canalise their transactions with it through a monopoly of their own, such action not being, regarded asdiscriminatory.C. Subsidies.(i) State action (by direct or indirect subsidies or by means of state trading) which results in the sale of goods in foreign markets at priceslower than those corresponding to the prices charged in the home market should be forbidden.(ii) Apart from this, there appears to be a case for leaving States free toprotect home production by means of direct and open State, subsidies.However, every effort should be made1&quot; to ensure that such subsidies are confined within moderate limits.
D. Tariffs.ii) There should be established for all ad color em duties an upper limit ofx per cent, with a corresponding limit for specific duties.(ii) Duties below this upper limit should be reduced by y per cent, of theirlevel as at the outbreak of war, with the proviso jthat no duty need bereduced below 10 per cent, ad valorem.(iii) These proposals should relate only to the protective element m dutiesii.e., they would not limit revenue duties).(iv) The proposals would be subject to any exceptions that might be approvedby the Commercial Union, in consultation as regards political aspectswith any other appropriate international body, for the protection ofindustries necessary on grounds of security,(v) The question might be considered whether special provisions could be devised to meet, on a reasonable scale, the temporary needs of infantindustries.E. Preferences.(i) Existing preferential margins (whether under Imperial Preference inthe United Kingdom and other Empire countries or in foreignEmpires or in regional arrangements between foreign countries)should be reduced&apos;by z per cent, of their level as at the outbreak ofwar, with the proviso that no preferential margin need be reduced below 5 per cent, ad valorem.(ii) No new preferences should be permitted in existing preferential areas;and no new preferences or Custom Unions should be established in anyother areas, without the approval of the Commercial Union, inconsultation as regards political aspects with any other appropriate international body.F. Export Taxes and Restrictions.Such devices should be subject to rules generally similar to those proposed forimport taxes and restrictions.G. The Commercial Union.(i) The suggested code of rules regarding commercial policy should be embodied in a multilateral convention, which would establish aCommercial Union of the adherent States; This multilateral conven-tion would not exclude supplementary bilateral agreements within the framework of the multilateral agreement.(ii) The member States should be required to give most-favoured-nation treatment to each other. They should be permitted to refuse most-favoured-nation treatment to non-member States.(iii) To prevent the formation of rival economic blocs, every endeavour shouldbe made to secure the adherence of all the United Nations and of leading neutral countries to the Convention.(iv) Subject to the general reservation that it will have to be decided in otherconnections what commercial terms are to be imposed on ex-enemy states, such States should be required to adhere to the Union (probably on terms) in order to prevent them from developing again an autarkiceconomy and exercising improper economic pressure on their neighbours.(v) The Commercial Union cannot work satisfactorily without the existenceof an international monetary body. At the same time, the observance of the rules of the Commercial Union should greatly facilitate theworking of any such monetary organisation. For this reason it is amatter for consideration whether membership of the two bodies shouldbe common. States which find one or the other the more attractive tothem might thus be induced to become members of both. The grounds for requiring any members of the Commercial Union to adhere also tothe monetary organisation appear particularly strong.fl&quot;. International Institutions.(i) The Commercial Union would need the institution of a Council orConference of its members to supervise its operation and to developits objectives. This body should possess the ultimate power ofexpelling from the Union any member State which persistentlydisregarded the rules of the Union.///
(ii) The above proposals also require the institution of a fact-finding body with quasi-judicial functions. Tor this purpose there might be instituted an international Commerce Commission, to which anymember State could appeal when it was aggrieved by any action of another member State in contravention of the rules of the Union. Anaggrieved State should be free to take immediate countervailingcommercial action against the offending member, but should be obliged to take the case for decision by the International CommerceCommission and to accept the decision of that body.Washington, 17th September, 1943.ANNEX H.Commercial Policy.Agreed Anglo-American Document on Commercial Policy.I. Tariffs.1. Multilateral tariff action.There are set forth below for further study tariff-reduction provisions for possible inclusion in a general multilateral convention on commercial policy.All of these are multilateral tariff-reduction formulas except the last (see E,below), which is a proposal for multilateral provisions embodying an undertaking to negotiate bilateral tariff agreements.It is the view of both the United States and the United Kingdom groups thatif a workable multilateral tariff-reduction formula acceptable to -a large numberof nations providing for a drastic reduction of tariffs without nullifying excep-tions and reservations can be found, it would be superior. It would be superiorbecause it would accomplish tariff reductions more- quickly and because it wouldmake it easier to accomplish the elimination of quotas and other non-tariff traderestrictions. The spirit of close international co-operation engendered by the warprovides a favourable atmosphere for multilateral action now; as the end of thewar approaches the atmosphere for such action may be expected to become less favourable; after the war it may be too late for such action.In the view of the United Kingdom group, it will not be possible to obtainadherence to a multilateral convention prohibiting quantitative import restrictions and limiting the use of other protective devices unless it includes a satisfactoryformula for multilateral tariff reduction. It is their view that a precise obligationto limit the use of other protective devices would be impossible without an equallycomprehensive and closely defined obligation covering tariffs, and that this couldbe achieved only if the convention provides for simultaneous mutilateral actionto reduce tariffs. Otherwise countries will be required to abandon the use of quantitative import restrictions and other instruments of protection in condi-tions in which the extent of the tariff benefits to be enjoyed later must inevitably be problematical. Moreover, in their view, the justifiable anxieties which willexist in many countries with serious balance-of payments problems will make itimpossible to proceed sufficiently far and fast by bilateral negotiations undermost-favoured-nation rules, which would involve giving concessions. to third parties without the assurance of corresponding counter-concessions.The United States group does not associate itself with the views set forth inthe paragraph above.2. Alternative provision for the implementation of tariff reduction.A. The reduction of all duties by x per cent, of their height at a given time,or to y per cent, ad valorem (or its equivalent in the case of specific duties), which-ever may result in the lower duty, but no duty need be reduced below z per cent.ad valorem (or its equivalent in the case of specific duties).[27117] &apos; f
Advantages.One of the principal advantages of formula A appears to be that it would bear more heavily on the higher duties and less heavily on the lower - duties.Countries with low tariffs would not be required to make the same total percentagereduction as countries with high tariffs.Disadvantages.Some of the principal disadvantages of formula A seem to be : (1) It would tend to destroy the tariff structure, i.e., the relationships betweenthe tariffs on different commodities of countries having a large numberof duties in excess of y per cent.; however, such countries might makeproper adjustment through downward revision of the related duties.(2) It would require the establishment of a relatively uniform system of tariff valuation among the various countries (and the conversion ofad valorem duties to the hew basis), in order that y per cent, andz per cent, might mean approximately the same thing in all countries.(3) It would require the determination of the ad valorem equivalents of specific duties. This would not be so difficult in countries which havea system of tariff valuation, but would present a problem for . thecountries which have adopted general systems of specific duties orsystems of arbitrary valuation.B. The uniform reduction of all duties in all countries by a given percentageof their height on a given date.A advantages.Some of the advantages of formula B appear to, be its simplicity andease of administration in all countries, its appearance of treating all countriesalike, and the fact that it would to a considerable extent preserve the relationships between the tariffs on different commodities.Disadvantages.The main disadvantage of formula B appears to be that it would reduce lowtariffs to the same relative extent as high tariffs, and therefore would almost certainly be considered as inequitable by low-tariff countries, particularly thosehaving specific duties the protective incidence of which has declined because of increased prices. This disadvantage might be remedied by providing for thereduction of the higher duties by a greater percentage than the lower. However,this would introduce technical difficulties of the kind indicated under A, above.C. The reduction of all duties by a given percentage, except that no dutyneed be reduced below a specified ad valorem, rate.A advantages.The advantages of formula C are that: (1) it would permit the applicationto high-tariff and low-tariff countries of a uniform tariff reduction in a mannerequitable to both; and (2) it would preserve to a considerable extent the tariffstructures of the various countries.Disadvantages.The main disadvantage of formula C is that, like formula A, it presentstechnical difficulties of tariff valuation and the conversion of specific duties,although on a lesser scale.D. The uniform reduction by a given percentage of the overall ad valoremequivalent of each country&apos;s entire tariff calculated in comparison with its totalimports. It is assumed that there would be provision preventing any increase induties. , -A advantages.The chief advantages of formula D appear to be that it would permit tariffreduction on a highly selective basis, would be free from technical problems of customs enforcement and would interfere to a relatively small degree with thetariff autonomy of the various countries. For these reasons, formula D might bemore attractive to a large number of countries than the other formulas considered.This formula would raise some technical questions, e.g., whether revenue duties should be included, &amp;c.
Disadvantages. -Some of the major disadvantages of formula D appear to be : (1) Existing methods of tariff measurement involve the use of the volume ofimports as weights, and since protective duties, especially highly pro-tective duties, curtail imports, the moderate duties receive in generalthe greatest weight. Therefore, under existing methods of tariffmeasurement, formula D might cause countries to bring about the required reduction in the overall ad valorem level by reducing the moderate duties, and there would be little or no incentive to reduce the highly protective or prohibitive duties. On the other hand, this formula would give no weight to reductions of superfluous duties onproducts of which there is little or no actual or potential importation.(2) Formula D would not require any greater proportionate tariff cut byhigh-tariff countries than by low-tariff countries.E. The inclusion in the proposed commercial policy convention of a pro-vision whereby each country would agree to negotiate with its principal suppliesbilateral agreements providing for tariff reductions on its major dutiable imports.This would, of course, involve dealing by the same method with preferences here-tofore regarded as exemptions from the most-favoured-nation clause.A advantages.The advantages of proposal E are that it would be technically sound and relatively free from problems of equity as between high-tariff and low-tariffcountries.Disadvantages.Disadvantages of this method of approach as compared with multilateralformulas are indicated under 1 above.3. Revenue Duties.It is assumed that any provisions for the simultaneous reduction of tariffs inall countries would not apply to revenue duties, which could be increased.Revenue duties might include the following : .(a) Duties which compensate for taxes imposed on the like domestic articlesor ingredients thereof.(6) Duties which are imposed on imports of products not. produceddomestically, with provision, if possible, for guarding against the non-reduction or increase of duties which are clearly designed to protectdomestic production of a closely competitive product.(c) Ancillary charges on imports commensurate with the cost of services rendered.4. Infant industries and security industries.There are strong arguments against permiting exceptions for the protectionof national defence or &quot;infant&quot; industries, in view of other methods, less objectionable than tariffs, available for this purpose. But in order to obtain the adherence of countries which are industrially undeveloped and which have difficulty in raising funds for the payment of subsidies, it may be necessary to contemplate some modification of this rule (see III, Quantitative import restrictions, paragraph 1; and V, Subsidies, paragraph 4).5. Other tariff measures.lit is believed that the problem of antidumping and countervailing duties,multi-column tariffs, tariff quotas, and other similar tariff measures, questionsregarding which would arise in connection with any multilateral conventionregarding tariffs, should be explored later, in the light of the particular tariff-reduction proposal selected as most feasible.6. Comments.It is believed that a major obstacle to the application of an equitable multi-lateral tariff-reduction formula is the technical problem of uniform tariff valuation and conversion of duties involved in the application to the tariffs of all countries ofuniform ad valorem &quot; floors &quot; or &quot; ceilings,&quot; and that further investigation of[27117] &quot; j 2
methods to overcome this obstacle might be useful. In this connection, the praticability of the following suggestions might be investigated : (a) The necessity for drastically changing the tariff valuation systems ^ ofmany countries to a single basis, and for the consequent recomputationof the existing ad valorem duties of those countries, might be providedby providing for a different ad valorem &apos;&apos; floor &quot; or &quot; ceiling &apos;&apos; for thetwo principal valuation systems now used, namely, landed value andforeign value. Thus the ad valorem tariff &quot; floor &quot; for countrieshaving a non-arbitrary valuation system based on landed value mightbe x per cent., whereas the &quot; floor &quot; for countries having a non-arbitrary valuation system based on foreign value might be x plus yper cent.(b) Countries having some system of non-arbitrary tariff valuation might,with relatively little difficulty, be able to modify it so as to conform to either a standard landed-value system or a standard foreign valuesystem, which might be described in the multilateral convention. Eachstandard system might be loosely described so as to require merely a rough uniformity among countries adhering to it.(c) A study might be undertaken of ways in which countries having primarilyspecific rates of duty, or having purely arbitrary valuation systems,might be assisted in establishing a satisfactory system of tariffvaluation.7. Conclusions.Further study would appear to be required before even tentative conclusionscan be reached as to which one of the tariff proposals outlined above would provesuitable for inclusion in the proposed general multilateral convention on commercial policy.II. Preferences.1. Article VII of the Mutual-Aid Agreement between the United Statesand the United Kingdom provides for agreed action looking not only toward thereduction of tariffs but also toward the elimination of all forms of discriminatorytreatment in international commerce. No convention of the kind proposed wouldgive final effect to these obligations unless it makes definite provision both for anadequate reduction of tariffs and for the ultimate substantial abolition of pre-ferences. There remains for determination at the proper time the difficult question of what reduction of tariffs, at one step or by stages, would be adequate to make possible the substantial abolition of preferences. It has become clear inthe course of the discussions that United States opinion would not consider itequitable or reasonable to contemplate drastic and comprehensive reduction of tariffs (assuming this to be feasible) if it were not accompanied by the simultaneoussubstantial abolition of preferences.2. It would seem desirable and necessary to provide in the proposed com-mercial policy convention for the following exceptions from the provisions forequality of tariff treatment (a) Preferences granted in order to facilitate frontier traffic (i.e., within azone not exceeding, say, 15 kilometres on each side of the frontier).(&amp;) Preferences granted as a transitional stage of an approved customs union.Such preferences should be excepted only if the attainment of thefull customs union is scheduled to be achieved within a fixed and reasonable period of years at a predetermined rate of moderation and final elimination of the internal duties.3. The provisions of the proposed commercial policy convention lookingtoward the abolition of tariff preferences would not apply to customs unionswhich already exist. However, future customs unions between any two or morecustoms areas should be reviewed by the proposed international commercial policy organisation (see VII, International Commercial Policy Organisation). In sofar as economic criteria are concerned, it is suggested that future customs unionsshould not be favourably viewed which failed to meet certain specified require-ments, among which might be the following : (a) In general, a union between two or more customs areas should be suchas would promote the economic selection and location of industry andafford in time the benefits of larger-scale and more specialisedproduction.
(6) The customs union should be effected by applying to the whole of theproposed new customs territory external rates of duty not in excessof the average of the corresponding rates previously applicable inthe constituent areas.There may be overriding political factors and considerations which mightrender certain proposed customs unions unacceptable even if they meet fully the test of&apos; the economic criteria suggested above; on the other hand, such considerations might impel the acceptance of certain customs unions which didnot meet all the desirable economic criteria.III. Prohibitions and Quantitative Restrictions on Imports.1. General Aspects.Absolute import prohibitions and import restrictions, such as quotas andlicensing systems, are among the devices most destructive of international trade.They introduce an element of rigidity into trade relationships which frequentlylends itself to speculative manipulations and erratic price fluctuations. Theyalmost inevitably&apos;result in discrimination among suppliers, uneconomic diversion of trade, international friction and ill will.As part of a multilateral convention the use of prohibitions or quantitative restrictions except in certain special cases should be prohibited. Their use forthe purpose of, protecting home industries, including infant industries and industries deemed necessary on grounds of national security, would be proscribed(see I, Tariffs, paragraph 4; and V, Subsidies, paragraph 4). Existing importprohibitions and restrictions would be abolished subject to specified exceptions.These exceptions would be held to a minimum and defined as closely as possiblein order to avoid loopholes through which the purposes of the convention wouldbe impaired.2. Exceptions.(a) Balance-of-payments difficulties. The use of quantitative restrictions to safeguard a country&apos;s balance of payments would be permissible, provided nopreferable means which would render unnecessary the imposition of quantitative restrictions were found. Any such restrictions would be applied only to theextent and so long as the country&apos;s balance-of-payments position required, andwould be subject to approval by the proposed international&apos; commercial policy organisation and to an objective test.  A suggested procedure is as follows : (1) The imposition of quantitative restrictions on imports for balance-of-payments reasons should be based on objective criteria. account should be taken of the balance of payments of the country in question with the rest of the world. The imposition of appropriate restrictionson imports, on a non-discriminatory basis between countries, shouldbe permitted if its balance on current account, together with inwardlong-term capital transactions, bad been seriously adverse over a specified period, or if the country&apos;s holdings of liquid reserves is inadequate. The deficit on balance of current account in the formeralternative might be measured as a percentage of a country&apos;s foreign trade; and the adequacy of the liquid reserves by a similar test orby reference to tests provided under any monetary scheme.(2) If in the light of these criteria a country concluded that action wasnecessary on its part, it would be entitled unilaterally to impose atemporary stoppage on any increase in its imports above those in themost recent twelve months&apos; period, but should be bound to obtain the subsequent approval of the proposed international commercial policy organisation for its action. Any more drastic action on its part wouldrequire the prior approval of such an organisation. The organisation should base its decision upon the objective criteria mentioned in(1) above. - .(3) Unless contrary arrangements were approved by the international commercial policy organisation, a country which imposed quantitative restrictions on imports under the foregoing rule would be required tocomplete their removal within twelve months if (on objective criteriacorresponding to those outlined in (1) above) its balance of payments on current account had been sufficiently favourable over a period andits holdings of liquid reserves had been restored to an adequate level.
(4) If quantitative restrictions on imports imposed under these rules continue for more than two (or perhaps three) years, the country in questionundertakes to consult with the international commercial policy organisation and with other appropriate international institutions inorder to determine whether some other action (such ias an adjustment of exchanges, alterations in the flow of international long-term capital or an expansion of money incomes in other countries) couldnot be appropriately taken.It may be necessary to consider a special supplementary provisionif arrangements are made under the proposed international monetaryinstitution for special measures to deal with scarce currencies.(b) Commodity agreements. The use of quantitative restrictions when necessary to implement a recognised international commodity agreement wouldbe allowed.(c) Other exceptions. The convention would provide for necessary andlegitimate exceptions in regard to such matters as sanitary regulations, &amp;c. Ifapplication is given to the principles laid down in the section on subsidies, itwould be unnecessary to have any exception with respect to the imposition of quantitative restrictions in connection with domestic production control measures.3. Temporary Emergency Exceptions.In the emergency period during and immediately following the war importprohibitions and quantitative limitations would be permitted when necessary tomeet emergencies arising from (a) the necessity of rationing imports because ofshortages of supplies, shipping or foreign exchange, and (b) a temporary surplusof stocks of the commodity to which the restriction applies. These temporaryexceptions would be applicable for a specified limited period after the cessation of hostilities unless the period of their application were further extended by action of the proposed international commercial policy organisation.4. Rules of Fair Conduct.The provisions in the multilateral convention with respect to importprohibitions and restrictions would include provisions designed to minimisediscriminatory and other objectionable practices in the administration of suchprohibitions and restrictions as were not prescribed. These rules would embodyprinciples such as those which have been included in the pertinent provisionsof trade agreements concluded by the United States (see, for example, Article Vof the United Kingdom-United States Trade Agreement and Article.Ill of theUnited States-Mexico Trade Agreement).5. Exchange Restrictions.Exchange restrictions should not be applied in a manner inconsistent withthe above provisions for the use of quantitative import restrictions.IV. Export Taxes and Restrictions.1. There should be agreed action looking toward the abolition of exporttaxes and restrictions.2. Provision in a general multilateral commercial policy convention for theabolition of quantitative restrictions on exports, including prohibitions, wouldin general be subject to the same carefully safeguarded exceptions as may beagreed upon in respect of quantitative restrictions on&apos; imports, in so far as theymay be pertinent (e.g., quantitative regulations imposed pursuant to recognisedinternational commodity agreements, &amp;c). In addition, it probably would benecessary to provide for exceptions in respect of quantitative export regulations which are (1) imposed under conditions of famine or severe domestic shortage in the exporting country, and (2) designed to regulate the trade in military supplies under specified conditions.3. Export taxes and other forms of government action which result in thesale of goods in foreign markets at prices higher than those corresponding to the domestic prices would be banned, subject to an exception for export taxesimposed for purposes of revenue. A revenue tax might be defined as. one whichdoes not result in the sale of a product for export at a price higher than that
corresponding to the price charged in the home market. Examples of revenuetaxes might be the following : (a) A tax on the export of a manufactured product which is compensated for by an equivalent tax on the domestic consumption of that product.(b) A tax on the export of a raw material&apos;which is compensated for by an equivalent tax on the raw material consumed by a domestic manufac-turing industry, whether for home consumption or export.(c) A tax on the export of a raw material which is not  consumeddomestically as a raw material by a manufacturing industry.It should be noted that in cases in which a country exgprts the whole of asubstantial part of the world&apos;s supply of a scarce commodity, and has no substan-tial home consumption of that commodity, compliance with the above definition of revenue export taxes would not serve as a check on. the height of the tax.Moreover, under such conditions importing countries would be forced to payable tax almost any height because of the absence of adequate alternative sources of supply. In such cases importing countries should be enabled to refer the matter to the proposed international commercial policy organisation.4. The convention would provide that revenue taxes, and, under like circum-stances and conditions, permissible quantitative restrictions, imposed on exports from any area, would be applied uniformly irrespective of destination.V. Subsidies.1. Subsidies are preferable to tariffs and other import restrictions as a means of protecting domestic industries because (a) they do not impose burdens on consumers, and (o) being visible, they are likely to be employed less frequentlyand for shorter duration than tariff and other import restrictions.2. However, export subsidies and other government action which results inthe sale of goods in foreign markets at prices lower than those corresponding tothe prices charged for like products in the home market (hereinafter referred toas export subsidies) are objectionable from the standpoint of commercial policyIn so far as they are effective, they cause uneconomic diversions of trade, workunjust hardships on competitors and engender international ill will.3. In any comprehensive international convention with respect to commercial policy that may be concluded, provision should be made looking to the elimination of export subsidies, including all forms of the two-price system, as soon aspracticable. Efforts would be made to induce countries parties to such a conven-tion to adopt less objectionable methods of assisting industries which they deemrequire State aid.4. Programmes for the subsidisation of products which do not result -inselling for export at prices less than those corresponding to the domestic prices,would not be banned. Further consideration should be given to the question ofinsuring that such subsidisation is kept within moderate limits and, in particular,to the question of setting a limit to the subsidisation of the production of goods of which world surpluses exist. The discussions have shown clearly that thepossibility of obtaining adherence to any rule prohibiting, in surplus areas, export subsidies on certain agricultural products in excess world supply will depend-upon the possibility of setting definite limits to the subsidisation of production in deficit areas (see also Section on Commodity Policy, IV, Subsidies). There wouldprobably have to be appropriate agreed exceptions for infant trades, security measures, &amp;c. (see I, Tariffs, paragraph 4; and III, Quantitative import restrictions, paragraph 1).5. Consideration probably should be given to the desirability of including, atthe appropriate place in any commercial policy convention, provisions with respectto export dumping by individual producers and associations of producers (see I,Tariffs, paragraph 5).6. Provision would be made for review by the proposed international com-mercial policy organisation in cases where a country believed that domesticsubsidies were in effect concealed or indirect export subsidies and that its interests were injured. The remission of taxes on exported goods probably should not beconsidered as an export subsidy within the meaning of this provision.VI. State Trading^1. Prior to the war one government, the Soviet Union, had a monopoly ofthe country&apos;s entire foreign trade and in other countries governmental tradino-was practised to some extent, It is not unlikely that conditions created by the warwill, tend to result in State trading on a more extensive scale than theretofore.
2. It is necessary, therefore, that methods and arrangements&quot; for tradingbetween private-enterprise countries and State-trading countries, whetherbilateral or multilateral, be such as to take account of this situation in order thatthe interests of both may be harmonised.3. The general objective of such methods and arrangements should be tomaximise the economic use of resources by : (a) elimination of discrimination; and(&amp;) expansion of trade.4. Any principles that may be adopted by private-enterprise countries withrespect to trade relations with State-trading countries must cover satisfactorilythe three general types of State trading, as follows : (a) complete State monopoly of a country&apos;s foreign trade;(b) State or State-sponsored monopoly of the trade in particular productsonly; and(c) non-monopolistic State trading.5. Creation of government-trading organisations by private enterprisecountries to deal with State-trading countries. Private-enterprise countries might be disposed to adopt the policy of creating State, or State-sponsored,trading organisations to handle their trade with State-trading countries with aview to improving their bargaining power and thereby obtaining better terms oftrade.  Such a course would be open to the following objections : , (a) Discrimination against other countries is likely to result from suchpractices. The creation of a government-trading organisation in aprivate-enterprise country to deal with a State-trading country might lead to barter-type arrangements between the two countries, withresulting discrimination usually associated with such arrangements.Large purchases by the private-enterprise country, induced by theopportunity for large scales, might reduce the market for competingproducts of third countries.(&amp;) If private-enterprise countries were to adopt State trading to deal withState trading elsewhere, there might be a progressive substitution ofState trading for private enterprise.(c) Moreover, it is questionable whether the difficulty such arrange-ments would be designed to meet will in reality prove a very seriousone. Available evidence based on past experience does not suggestthat State-trading countries have in fact taken advantage of theirstrong negotiating position to the real detriment of competingindividual traders in other countries.Consequently, it is suggested that government action in private-enterprisecountries should be confined to ordinary trade control measures, within the limitsset by the general commercial policy convention, which set the conditions underwhich private traders can conduct business with the foreign State-trading country, just as they do in the case of trade with private-enterprise countries^-In that case, in any agreements between governments of State-trading countries and private-enterprise countries, the concessions made by the latter would be ofexactly the same kind as those made to private-enterprise countries,&quot; i.e.,concessions designed to improve the opportunities for trade by the State-trading country with private traders in the private-enterprise country.6. Bilateral minimum purchase commitments from particular supplying countries. A possible type of agreement would be one whereby a, State-trading country undertakes&apos;a minimum purchase Commitment, of all products or specifiedproducts, such purchases to be made in the supplying country party to thearrangement as a quid pro quo for relaxation of barriers to trade with private interests in the supplying country.Such an arrangement is objectionable because it tends to discriminate amongsupplying countries; i.e., comparative costs and competitive market conditionsmight exist or develop, whereby the State-trading country would be compelled, ifit complied with the specified minimum purchase commitment, to purchase goods from the other country party to the arrangement which could be purchased more economically elsewhere. The same objection does not apply to long-term contracts made by State-trading organisations on terms based solely on commercial considerations.7. Purchases allocated in consultation with suppliers. Under such anarrangement the State-trading country desiring to purchase specified commodities
would allocate them in a non-discriminatory manner among the supplying countries on the basis of multilateral consultation and agreement between the interested governments.Such- an arrangement might in some cases be impracticable because of thetime consumed in making arrangements for numerous specific transactions andthe possibility of disputes among sellers. It would presumably require continuousand active participation by the governments concerned with respect to particularcommercial transactions. There may be cases in which such negotiated arrange-ments may prove the least objectionable method of allocating markets.8. Purchases solely on basis of commercial considerations. Under such anarrangement the State-trading country might purchase any commodity abroadeither from private traders or the government of any supplying country without prior consultation with the governments of countries which were alternative sources of supply, subject merely to the general undertaking that such purchasesshall be governed solely by commercial considerations (e.g., Article VIII, UnitedKingdom-United States trade agreement) and with possible provision for appeal by an interested government to, and review by, the proposed international commercial policy organisation.Such an arrangement would provide a general basis for assuring non-discriminatory treatment without, however, imposing any contractual limitation on the degree of protection of domestic industry by the State-trading country.Such assurances of nondiscriminatory treatment, however, are essential to any international arrangements for dealing with State trading.9. Provisions to limit the use of State monopolies in giving excess protection to home production. Countries might undertake not to give greater protectionby means of State trading than they would be permitted to do under the otherclauses of the general commercial convention. (1) The relationship between theprice paid to the foreign supplier and the price charged to the home consumer,and (2) the question whether the monopoly was satisfying the full domestic demand for the foreign product, might help to determine whether the degree ofprotection exceeded that allowed by any maximum specified in the section dealingwith tariff policy. These criteria would be applied in combination with provisions for nondiscriminatory treatment as in point 8, above.. These criteria would not preclude such direct subsidies as may be permitted in the case of non-monopolised goods to either domestic producers or. consumers inrespect of like or similar domestic products (see V, Subsidies, above). Also, ifrevenue tariffs are to be excepted from any rule limiting the height of tariffs, acorresponding exception will probably have to be made in the case of productsmonopolised and sold at a high price domestically primarily for revenue ratherthan protective purposes. If in the case of State-trading monopolies an appro-priate limit could be set between, on the one hand, the price paid to the foreignsupplier and, on the other hand, the price paid to the domestic producer, or thatcharged to the domestic consumer (whichever is the lower), suitable allowance willhave been made both for subsidies on domestic production and for the use ofmonopolised trading for revenue purposes.The utility of any such price criterion is necessarily limited. It is likely tobe readily applicable only to single-product monopolies in private-enterprisecountries. Moreover, certain administrative problems would arise in connectionwith such a rule; e.g., the problem of determining equitable processing anddistribution costs. This would involve the problem of defining and determining the price paid the foreign supplier, and of defining the selling price, particularlyin the case of products not ready for direct consumption, including, when the monopoly sold domestic as well as foreign goods, the allocation of processing anddistribution costs between foreign and domestic supplies.For these reasons a price criterion of this kind cannot be used as a precise andarithmetical rule. Nevertheless, if countries adopting State-trading monopolieswere to undertake not to use such monopolies to give protection to their domestic production in excess of the amount of protection permitted under the otherclauses of the multilateral commercial policy convention, these price relationshipsmight be used as a general guide in considering any complaint that a particular country is using a trading monopoly to provide excessive protection to its domestic production.10.   Minimum global purchase commitment by a State-trading countryunallocated by countries. Under such an arrangement the State-trading country,in return for tariff and other trade concessions from private-enterprise countries&apos;would undertake to purchase abroad not less than specified amounts, either of[27117]   &apos; &apos;    G
particular products or of total imports, depending on whether the commitment ismade in bilateral agreements or in a multilateral convention.Reasonable flexibility in regard to such minimum purchase commitmentmight be provided by an escape clause relating to the country&apos;s foreign.exchangeavailabilities.Such arrangements should include provisions assuring non-discriminatorytreatment.The countries negotiating bilateral agreements with State-trading countries on this basis could, as compensation for tariff or other trade concessions to thelatter, select products of particular export interest to them in respect of whichminimum purchase commitments unallocated among supplying countries would bemade by the State-trading country. In this way they could negotiate agreements for.bringing about an expansion of their trade with the State-trading country without causing the latter to discriminate against the trade of any other country,since in this as in other cases there would be a general commitment on the part ofState-trading countries to buy always in the best market.Similarly, in a multilateral convention a country with a complete Statemonopoly of foreign trade might equitably be asked to give a commitment withrespect to its total imports in view of the fact that the multilateral convention would be conferring benefits on the State-trading country in the form of relaxation-tion of trade barriers by all of the other parties to the convention.Undertakings of the sort above indicated might well foster increasingparticipation in world trade on the part of State-trading countries such as theSoviet Union, on the basis of productive aptitudes.11. Conclusions.(a) A general multilateral commercial policy convention for the expansionof international trade on a non-discriminatory basis, which should be so devisedthat countries having a complete State monopoly of foreign trade&apos; can associate themselves with it, might contain a commitment whereby such countries would agree to purchase from outside sources goods to a total specified value, withoutspecifying particular countries or products. Such a commitment on the partof a country having a complete State monopoly of foreign trade could be con-sidered a counterpart to measures for the relaxation of trade barriers whichprivate-enterprise countries would be undertaking to make effective pursuant tosuch a convention.(&amp;) A country having a monopoly for the whole or part of its foreign trade might be asked to agree not to use such a monopoly so as to give protection toits domestic producers in excess of that which would be permitted under otherclauses of the convention. The relation between the prices paid to foreignsuppliers and the prices paid to domestic producers or charged to domestic consumers might in some cases help to determine whether State-trading mono-monopolies were being misused for the purpose of giving excessive protection. Thiscriterion is likely to be effectively applicable only to single-product monopoliesin private-enterprise countries.(c)Such a general multilateral commercial policy convention snould alsolay down the general principles to govern the practices of State-trading countries,partial or complete, and the principles to govern the negotiation of agreements with such countries, including the following : (1) That purchases and sales by governments shall conform to the principlethat they shall be made in accordance solely with commercial considera-tions, as provided in Article VIII of the United States-UnitedKingdom trade agreement; and accordingly,(2) that purchases of specified quantities of goods by any State-trading country, provided for in any inter-governmental agreement, shall notbe limited to purchases in the other country or countries participating in the agreement, but shall be global purchases to be made in thecountry or countries best able to supply the goods, except possiblycountries not participating in the general multilateral convention. Afurther exception might be made in cases where purchases areallocated in accordance with an agreement among the principalcountries supplying and consuming the goods in question (see para-graph 7, above). - This clause is not intended to preclude contracts for purchases by State-trading organisations provided that they do not conflict with the principle laid down in point c (1), above.
(d) It is suggested that government action in private-enterprise countries iiitrading with State monopolies in other countries should be confined to their normal trade control measures (such as adjustment of tariffs) exercised within thelimits set by the general commercial policy convention rather than that theyshould institute special counter-monopolies.(e) During a temporary period after the cessation of hostilities, the lengthof which should be laid down in the multilateral commercial policy convention,member countries might be excused from the strict application of the foregoingrules to their trading monopolies in those cases in which emergency conditions(such as shortages of supplies, of shipping or of foreign exchange, or the need to dispose of temporary surplus stocks) necessitate exceptional action.  *VII. International Commercial Policy Organisation.1. The creation of an appropriate international commercial policy organisa-tion seems essential to the successful operation of any general multilateralcommercial policy convention. Discussions regarding the possible subject-matterof such a convention have disclosed that it would be desirable to include thereinseveral provisions, some of vital importance, which could be made workable only with the assistance of some organisation representing all the member countries.Among these would be provisions for the application by the organisation ofstated criteria to : id) future customs unions; (b) quantitative import regulationsimposed on grounds of balance-of-payments difficulties; (c) State-trading operations; (d) revenue tariffs; (e) subsidy programmes; and (/) exportrestrictions imposed on grounds of severe domestic shortage.2. In general, the purposes of the proposed international commercial policy organisation would be as follows : (a) To provide information to member countries regarding the implement a-tion of the convention by other member countries.(b) To afford a source of consistent interpretation regarding the provisionsof the convention.(c) To carry out investigative and  fact-finding  functions required  orpermitted by the provisions of the convention.(d) To provide a mechanism for the consideration of complaints, the adjust-ment of differences, and appropriate action in cases of non-observance of the convention.(e) To recommend to member countries any amendments to the- convention which appear desirable in the light of experience.3. Further consideration might show the desirability, for administrativereasons of providing within the proposed commercial policy organisation for :(1) a Council, or supervisory body, representing all member countries, to whichwould be referred important policy matters; and (2) a Commission, or operatingbody, preferably a small group assisted by a staff of experts, which would carry outinvestigative and fact-finding functions and consider minor complaints, &amp;c,subject to periodic review by the Council. It is believed the organisation shouldbe guided by a &quot;set of general rules, made as precise as possible, which would beincluded in the convention, in order to avoid burdening it with too great a measureof responsibility.4. In addition to the proposed international organisation on commercial policy, consideration is being or may be given to the creation of separate inter-national organisations to deal with problems of currency stabilisation, commodity agreements, and possibly others such as international investment and cartels,the membership of which may not be identical. In view of the closely relatedcharacter of these fields, and the possibility that measures might be taken by oneorganisation which would be inconsistent with measures taken by the others, itis suggested that consideration be given to some form of economic organisation to co-ordinate their activities (see also Section on International Co-ordinationof Measures for the Maintenance of High Levels of Employment, below).5. It is believed that the convention should be so drawn as tp be open toadherence by all nations. Ex-enemy countries should, of course, be allowed tobecome members of the proposed convention. In view of their recent commercialhistory, and for reasons of security they might well be compelled to join, if itshould prove necessary.[27117] o 2
6. Parties to the convention should be required to give each other most-favoured-nation treatment. Nations which, after invitation, have refused toparticipate in the proposed convention, should be denied its benefits. Unlessmember nations are required to deny such benefits, for example their tariff reduc-tions, to the trade of non-members, there might be a strong tendency on theone hand for nations to remain outside the convention and bargain individuallywith member nations, and on the other hand for member nations to compete with each other in obtaining special favours from non-member nations. It is proposedthat the general rule against granting the benefits of the convention to non-member nations might be relaxed by empowering the international commercial policy organisation to recommend exceptions in justified cases.-   ANNEX I,Commercial Policy.Document arising out of United States-Canadian Discussions.Informal Exploratory Conversations between Officials of the United States and canada regarding the Formulation of an Agenda for Discussions lookingtoward the Implementation of the Principles Enunciated in the Exchangeof Notes between the United States and Canada on 3foth November, 1942.Washington, 3rd to 7th January, 1944, and New York, 12th to 13th February,1944.Economic Policy other than Monetary and Financial;Section on Commercial Policy.The procedure adopted for the American-Canadian talks on commercial policy, of which this is a summary, was a topic by topic discussion of thecommercial policy section of the joint statement of the 16th October, 1943,resulting from the earlier informal talks by the American and British groupson economic policy other than monetary or financial. Where it is stated below that the Canadian group concurred with or had no objection to any designatedportion of the United States-United Kingdom statement, the implication is thatthe American group had not changed its position with regard to such portionsince formulation of that statement. Numerical references to that statementhereinunder are to the section on commercial policy.I. Multilateral Approach.1. It is highly desirable to negotiate a multilateral convention on commercial policy covering both quantitative import restrictions- and tariffs. Such anattempt should be made at the earliest possible moment while conditions of relativecommodity scarcity still obtain and foreign competition is of relatively littleconcern to domestic producers and before demobilisation of war industry has set in and vested interests in war-time restrictions on imports become too highly developed. The Canadian group suggested that the convention should cover an initial period of at least ten years.2. The multilateral convention should be so drawn that all States couldaccede to it including industrially undeveloped countries as well as industrial countries and countries with largely State-directed economies as well as countries where private enterprise predominates.3. The American group felt that if it should not prove feasible to removequantitative import restrictions and reduce tariffs simultaneously, serious consideration should be given to the negotiation of a convention providing forimmediate removal of quantitative import restrictions and for subsequentbilateral negotiations to reduce tariffs. The Canadian group felt that, on thecontrary, since quantitative restrictions and tariffs are often alternative formsof protection, undertakings to eliminate quantitative restrictions and to reducetariffs ought to be reciprocal and simultaneous. With respect to the carrying outof these undertakings it was urged that during the transitional period, there may
well be circumstances which would require that certain countries with unbalancedeconomies should be given an agreed, period in which to liquidate quantitative restrictions while tariffs should be reduced forthwith.4. In general the Canadian group was in accord with the United Kingdomview expressed in the United States-United Kingdom statement (I, 1, p. 6) :that a definite commitment to abolish quantitative restrictions should be accompanied by an equally precise commitment to effect substantial reductions in tariffs. In the view of the Canadian group the extent of the overall reduction should be of the order of, say, 50 per cent, in most-favoured-nation rates.II. Negotiation, Adherence and Generalisation Procedure.There was general agreement that the following procedure regarding negotia-tion, adherence and generalisation with respect to the proposed multilateralconvention on commercial policy might be desirable : (1) Agreement should be reached first among the United States, the UnitedKingdom, the countries of the British Commonwealth, the U.S.S.R.,and as many other countries as practicable, on a draft conventiondesigned to be feasible of adherence by all countries.(2) Prior to signature by the original group, the draft convention would besubmitted to other countries with a view to obtaining their agreementthereto without any important exceptions or reservations in respectof any particular country.(3) The convention should come into force upon adherence by a group of countries which could form an adequate nucleus.(4) When the tariff reductions and other benefits of the convention enter intoforce they should be extended to other countries for a stated time tocover the period of notice generally required for the revocation oftrade treaties and most-favoured-nation arrangements. After the expiry of this period the benefits should be withdrawn from countrieswhich have not adhered to the convention; it might well be desirable for the international organisation to be granted authority to extend the period for adherence or to make exceptions in the terms of theconvention in justifiable cases for particular countries.(5) The convention should include a provision for the abrogation and pro-hibition of all commitments regarding the maintenance of margins ofpreference and rates bound against decrease so that all rates wouldbecome and continue to be freely negotiable. (Although the UnitedStates group agreed with the substance of this statement, it questionedthe appropriateness of including it in Section II rather than inSection IV.)(6) The convention should provide that all reductions in rates resulting fromthe tariff reduction formula and all subsequent reductions in rates byany signatory country must be extended automatically and uncon-ditionally to all the signatories of the convention.III. Tariffs.1. Tariff-Reduction Formula?.The first three alternative formulae in the United States-United Kingdomstatement (I, 2, pp. 7-8) were discussed on the understanding that they referredsolely to most-favoured-nation rates-not to preferential rates nor to any rateshigher than the most-favoured-nation rates. The Canadian group felt thatformula A uniform reduction with a ceiling and a floor-would most effectivelyaccomplish the purpose of world tariff reduction. However, recognising thetechnical difficulties of applying the ceiling formula to specific duties and differentvaluation systems the Canadian group thought that consideration might be givento a modified form of formula C. Both groups agreed on the following modifica-tion of formula C as a tentative basis for further discussion of tariff reduction inthe proposed convention : all duties to be reduced by a given percentage of theirlevel as of a given date, say, the 1st July, 1939, with a provision that no countryis obliged to reduce any ad valorem duty below 10 per cent., on the basis of a specified method of valuation, and that any country may instead of reducing a duty of a form other than ad valorem substitute for such duty an ad valorem dutynot to exceed 10 per cent, calculated according to a specified basis of valuation.
It might be found necessary to allow certain countries lacking experience invaluation to establish reduced duties of other form to a level not exceeding 10 percent, in ad valorem equivalent; the question as to what is the ad valoremequivalent thereof to be reviewed by the proposed international commercial policy organisation.No duty which has been reduced in accordance with this convention shallthereafter be increased, nor shall its form (e.g., ad valorem, specific, compound, &amp;c.)be changed except that any other form of duty may be changed to an ad valoremduty which is of no higher rate as determined, in case of necessity, by the proposed international commercial policy organization. No duty which has not beenreduced by this convention shall hereafter be fixed at a higher rate than was ineffect on the 1st July, 1939, nor shall it be expressed in a form different from thatin use at said date, except that any other form of duty may be changed to an ad valorem duty which is of no higher rate, as determined, in case of necessity, bythe proposed international commercial policy organization. No duty shall here-after be established or maintained on any article which as of the 1st July, 1939,was free of duty.2. Revenue Duties.In general the proposed exemption of revenue duties from the provisionsrespecting tariff reductions and tariff binding and the definition of revenueduties in I, 3, p. 8 of the United States-United Kingdom statement, were satisfactory to the Canadian group. However, discussion brought out the need ofassuring that where such duties are used to provide funds for paying subsidiesthe revenue duty does not become in effect a protective duty.3, Infant Industries and Security Industries.It was agreed that, in general, subsidies should be relied upon as the mechanism for governmental assistance to necessary infant industries and security industries.Both groups emphasized that no exceptions should be allowed to the terms ofthe convention on security grounds. Whatever legitimate claim &quot;infantindustries &quot; may have to special measures of assistance might be met in one ormore of the following ways : (a) through the granting of exceptions in appropriate cases by the proposed international commercial-policy organisation in accordance withagreed criteria and procedure;(&amp;) through subsidies (see VII below);(c) through international assistance by provision of long-term capital orotherwise.4. Tariff Quotas.It was agreed that where a tariff quota was in existence as of the 1st July,1939, the tariff reduction formula should apply to both the upper and lower ratesthereof. The Canadian group felt that in a convention abolishing quantitative restrictions tariff quotas, which in the last analysis are of the same nature, shouldbe dealt with in the same way. In the possible event that provisions for tariffreduction in the multilateral convention should apply only to the lower of the tworates on products subject to tariff quotas, the situation with respect to such products if such quotas were not abolished would be as restrictive as before theconvention took effect, if not more so. &apos;IV.-Preferences.1. The following statement on preferences is contained in. the agreedsummary of the British-American discussions (II, 1, p. 9) : -&apos;&apos; Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement between the United Statesand the United Kingdom provides for agreed action looking not only towardthe reduction of tariffs, but also toward the elimination of all forms of discriminatory treatment in international commerce. No convention of thekind proposed would give final effect to these obligations unless it makesdefinite provision both for an adequate reduction of tariffs and for theultimate substantial abolition of preferences. There remains for determina-tion at the proper time the difficult question of what reduction of tariffs, atone step or by stages, would be adequate to make possible the substantial
abolition of preferences. It has become clear in the course of the discussions that United States opinion would not consider it equitable or reasonable to contemplate drastic and comprehensive reduction of tariffs (assuming this to be feasible) if it were not accompanied by the simultaneous substantialabolition of preferences.&quot;2. The Canadian group pointed out that, if agreement could be reached on ,a multilateral reduction of, say, 50 per cent. in most-favoured-nation rates,that in itself would eliminate a great many preferential margins and would reduce every one of the remaining margins by at least one-half. In the opinionof the Canadian group, this would go a long way toward the &quot; substantialabolition of preferences &quot;and is all that could reasonably be attempted in the multilateral convention. The reduction of residual margins might be accom-plished in the following ways : (a) by simultaneous bilateral agreements for thefurther reduction of duties and the reciprocal exchange of free rates this wouldbe possible, since all rates would be freely negotiable as a result of the abrogationin the convention of commitments regarding the binding of rates and margins;(b) by the possibility of eliminating certain preferential margins by distinguishing,for more general purposes, between preferences freely exchanged between thecountries of the British Commonwealth and those granted in the non-self-governing colonies, particularly in what were open-door areas prior to 1932.3. The Canadian group felt in principle that it would be unreasonable forthe United States to expect to achieve in a multilateral convention reductions of preferences below the level to which the general 50 per cent, reduction inmost-favoured-nation rates would bring them. The request for the elimination of all preferences would require either (a) the removal of all duties on all productsnow admitted duty-free from the United Kingdom, or (b) the imposition of new or higher duties on hundreds of tariff classifications on which the BritishPreference rate is now free. In the opinion of the Canadian group, procedure (a)would clearly not be practical for Canada, while procedure (b) would run counter to traditional use of British Preferential rates as a means of reducing tariffs and would be in conflict with the main purpose of the proposed convention.4. In the view of the United States group, the extent of the tariff reduc-tion called for in the Canadian suggestion would clearly place it within the scopeof the phrase &quot; drastic and comprehensive &quot; used in the joint statement of the16th October, 1943, and would therefore need to be accompanied by provisions for the simultaneous substantial abolition of preferences as indicated in thestatement (see sub-section II, point 1, p. 11). While it is not possible at thisstage to determine with accuracy how far the Canadian proposal might gotoward the elimination of imperial preferences, it seems clear that a significantproportion of them would remain. It would be extremely difficult to defend aconvention providing for drastic tariff reductions while leaving in existence animportant segment of the preferential system to be negotiated away&apos; in supple-mentary bilateral agreements involving still further tariff reduction. Such aconvention would be open to the criticism that the United States had used upalmost all its tariff bargaining power without achieving the objective with regardto discriminatory treatment set forth in the Mutual Aid agreements. It would,moreover, be extremely doubtful if the United States Congress would grant thenecessary authority to negotiate supplementary bilateral agreements providingfor tariff reductions beyond, those brought about through the multilateralconvention.5. The United States group suggests that consideration might ^ be given toprovisions along the following lines which would accompany provisions for the adequate reduction of tariffs (X per cent.) under a multilateral formula andwhich might meet, in part, the requirements for the simultaneous substantialabolition of preferences : - . &apos;(a) If there is no, or only insignificant, domestic production, the non-preference duty must be reduced 50 per cent., or to the level of thepreference rate, whichever gives the lower rate.(&amp;) Provided that, if the country wishes to maintain the duty as a revenueduty, it may fix it at any level not exceeding the present level ifpreference is entirely eliminated.(c) If the non-preference rate is 10 per cent, ad valorem or less, either it mustbe reduced 50 per cent, or the preference, rate must be raised to equalthe non-preference rate.
4-8.(d) If the reduction of the non-preference rate by 50 per cent, would bring it below 10 per cent., it may be fixed at any figure not over 10 per cent,provided the preference rate is raised to the same level.6. The United States group stressed the need for a general formula to dealwith residual preference and suggested for consideration the following, whichwould be supplemented by 5 (a) and (b) above: no margin of preferenceremaining after the application of the tariff reduction formula would be lefthigher than X per cent, of what it was on, say, the 1st July, 1939.V. Prohibitions and Quantitative Restrictions on Imports.1. It was agreed that, as set forth in the United States-United Kingdomstatement (III, 1, p. 10), import prohibitions and import restrictions, such asquotas and licensing systems, are among the devices most destructive of inter-national trade, and, as part of a multilateral convention, should, except incertain special cases which would be held to a minimum and closely defined, be prohibited. In no case should their use for the purpose of protecting homeindustries, including infant industries and industries deemed necessary on grounds of national security, be permitted.   (See I, 3, above.)2. The Canadian group had no objection to the granting of exceptions tothe prohibition on quantitative restrictions during a specified transitional periodon grounds of balance-of-payments difficulties, for the purpose of implementinga recognised -international commodity agreement, or for other agreed purposes,along the general lines laid down in III, 2, (pp. 10-11) of the United States-United Kingdom statement.3. The Canadian group likewise had no objection to the proposals for temporary emergency exceptions and for rules of fair conduct in respect to per-missible quantitative import restrictions, as stated in United States-United King-dom statement (III, 3 and 4, p. 11).4. In view of the fact that a question had been raised with regard to themeaning of III, 5, p. 11, of the United States-United Kingdom statement, itwas explained that the paragraph means that countries should be forbidden touse exchange control to evade the general prohibition on quantitative restrictions,and has no reference to the question under what circumstances, if any, exchange restrictions might be permitted.The Canadian group endorsed the recommendation in subsection IV, on export taxes and restrictions, of the United States-United Kingdom statement that there should be agreed action looking toward the abolition of export taxes and restrictions, and expressed general concurrence with the lines of such action as proposed in the said subsection. Both groups agreed that it may be desirableto consider including special provisions in the multilateral convention on com-mercial policy to permit restrictions on exports of certain natural resources inthe interest of conservation, subject to the approval of the appropriate inter-national economic authorities.1. Both groups agreed that, as a general principle, export subsidies andother forms of two-price systems should be banned. However, it was felt that price and income supporting measures, particularly with reference to primaryindustries, are inevitable in the post-war period in many countries. Also certain countries may consider that if they drastically reduce their tariffs and eliminatequantitative restrictions on imports as a result of the proposed multilateral con-vention, it will be necessary for them to use subsidies as a method of assistance.It is therefore important that agreement be reached&apos; as to the means by which governments may render such assistance without having to resort to quantitativeimport restrictions and export subsidies.S&apos;&apos; It was thought that one such method might be the use of income subsidieswhich do not affect prices in the market. Another might be governmentallyguaranteed prices to producers.  It was recognised, however, that either of theseVI. Export Taxes and Restrictions.VII. ^Subsidies.
methods could have as injurious effects on particular surplus situations as directprice supporting measures which involve two-price systems and import restrictions.3. Both groups thought that certain surplus situations affecting inter-nationally traded commodities might well arise which would call for specialinternational commodity agreements. In such cases the use of two-price systemsmight be permitted in accordance with the terms of such agreements.. In thisconnection the Canadian group thought that it would be very desirable to explorefurther the possibilities of the use of buffer stocks as a device which might proveadequate for many cases which might otherwise be thought to require specialintergovernmental arrangements involving two-price systems.VIII.- State Trading.1. The Canadian group thought that it might be undesirable to requirecountries with a complete State monopoly of foreign trade, such as Russia, to commit themselves to purchase minimum global quantities of products as acondition of becoming associated with the convention on reduction of trade barriers and of receiving its benefits (see subsection VI, paragraph 10, p. 15).Such a provision is not needed from the viewpoint of exporting interests in private enterprise countries, for if Russia cares to make use of the improvedopportunities for exporting its goods which would result from the convention, itwould ordinarily increase its imports pari passu. Furthermore, Russia mightwell feel that an obligation on its part to buy should be coupled in the conventionwith a counter-obligation on the part of other countries to sell. The allocation of such a counter-obligation among countries of supply might present difficult problems. Also at times for instance on the occasion of Russia possibly receiv-ing large loans the countries which had agreed to supply minimum amountsmight face acute difficulties in meeting their commitments.2. The United States group recognised that, since a country such as Russiatends to import to the limit of its ability, a global purchase commitment mightnot be of great practical benefit to exporters in private-enterprise countries.Nevertheless, in the view of the United States group, it would appear highly desirable, if not essential that complete State-trading countries give some visiblequid pro quo for the benefits received from private-enterprise countries. Theproposal for a global purchase commitment should not he discarded, therefore,in the absence of some more satisfactory visible commitment.3. It was felt by both groups that, if tariff reduction and removal of quanti-tative import restrictions are effectively carried out by all countries adhering to the convention, increased pressure for State-operated importation might facesome Governments which because of budgetary difficulties or other reasons do not find subsidisation feasible.4. The Canadian group suggested that the proposed requirement that theforeign purchases and sales of State monopolies be governed solely by commercial considerations, i.e\, on a non-discriminatory basis (see VI, paragraphs, p. 14),might be strengthened by supplementary provisions requiring the publication of price and other data on State trading which would serve as a means of verifyingits objectives and non-discriminatory character.5. Both groups felt the need of further thought before formulating adefinite position on State trading.IX. International Commercial Policy Organisation.It was agreed, in conformity with the United States-United Kingdom state-ment (VII, 1, p. 16), that the creation of an appropriate international commer-cial policy organisation seems essential to the successful operation of any generalmultilateral commercial policy convention. The Canadian group was in generalagreement with subsection VII of the United States-United Kingdom statemen tregarding the functions of such an organisation and the principles on which itshould operate. The Canadian group thought that formal connection should beestablished by the new body with existing international bodies and that the latter should continue to function, Where appropriate, in close relation with the new organisation.[27117]
ANNEX J.Commodity Policy.Agreed Anglo-American Document on International Commodity Policy.I. General Principles.1. International commodity arrangements should be so framed as to bein harmony with the general expansionist policy which, it is hoped, will be the guiding economic principle of nations in the post-war period-i.e,, they should ensure a free and full flow of primary products into consumption to the utmostextent compatible with measures which may be necessary, in certain cases, forthe protection of producers. It is, however, recognised that such arrangementscannot be expected, in themselves, to provide full protection for primaryproducers against economic vicissitudes similar to those experienced in the inter-war period; they must be considered as dependent upon and as a corollary towider action designed to promote the expansion of orderly world economy, e,g.,action in the sphere of currency stabilisation, commercial policy and the like.2. It is agreed that the primary objectives of international commodity policy should be : (a) The mitigation of violent short-term price fluctuations.(b) A system which would not only achieve (a) but which would help to counteract business cycles.(c) In general, a state of affairs under which price adjustments would follow changes in the basic conditions of supply and demand and inwhich there would increasing opportunities for supplying worldrequirements from countries able to furnish such requirements most effectively.(d) Provision for special action on an international basis which may benecessary in cases where there is persistent disequilibrium betweensupply and demand for the protection of producers and the facilities of orderly change during the transitional periods in which adjust-ments of production to effective demand are being made, particularlyin those cases in which the national Governments have taken or might take independent action to support their producers.II. International Commodity Organisation.1. An international commodity organisation should be established in close association with other international agencies in the field of commercial policy,currency, investment, &amp;o, and should be open to accession by all States.*It will be essential to formulate certain broad principles to determine the corn-position and govern the operations of the organisation and its associated bodies;some of these principles are indicated below.2. As the international commodity organisation will inevitably be con-cerned with a number of agricultural commodities, it will be of particular importance that a very close liaison should be established between it and thePermanent Organisation for Food and Agriculture. For instance, it might wellbe found appropriate to arrange for the Permanent Organisation for Food and agriculture to be represented upon the General Executive of the international commodity Organisation.3. The international commodity organisation would be charged with responsibility for reviewing, supervising and co-ordinating international commodity arrangements of all kinds and, if necessary, for initiating them. Theorganisation would help to form such arrangements and would review andreport upon them before they were submitted to Governments for conclusion.In scrutinising such arrangements the organisation would be required to haveregard to the agreed objectives and principles governing international commodity policy.4. All States participating in the international commodity organisation would undertake that any international arrangements in regard to a primary* There may have to be agreed provisions indicating the terms upon which States should- be allowed to join the organisation.   The conditions upon which ex-enemy States should be obliged or allowed to join would need special consideration.
product involving prices, trade or production, into which they or their nationalspropose to enter or have entered prior to the establishment of the organisation should be communicated in full detail to the international commodity organisa-tion for review and report.5. The principal organ of the international commodity organisation wouldbe a General Commodity Council composed of representatives of all member states, which would have a veto power in respect of action taken by the GeneralExecutive. The votes in the Council would be allocated among its members on a proportional basis, account being taken of their respective share in international trade. There may, however, have to be special arrangements inthe matter of voting power in the case of elections to the General Executive.Decisions would be made by simple majority of all the votes in the Council.6. The General Council would elect a small General Executive which wouldmake an annual report on its operations to the Council. Each member of theExecutive would have one vote.7. The General Executive should be empowered to establish or approve the creation of individual commodity organisations (which might well be formed in appropriate cases by the adaptation of existing international bodies) to assistit in dealing with particular commodities, as the agencies responsible to it for conducting operations in accordance with the principles laid down in the con-stitution of the international commodity organisation.It would be a fundamental principle that in the composition of any suchancillary organisations, countries largely dependent upon imports for suppliesof the particular commodity in question should have a combined vote equal tothe exporting countries. Provision should also be made for the appointmentof independent members (i.e., in addition to the representatives of importingand exporting countries by the General Executive).8. Opportunities shall be provided, in the case of any commodity arrange-ment approved by the General Executive, for participation by any countryhaving a substantial interest in the international trade in the commodity inquestion on terms no less favourable than those accorded to other countries participating in the arrangements.III. Methods of International Commodity Policy.1. Buffer stock arrangement.(a) It is agreed that, while the degree to which buffer stock technique is applicable, must vary from commodity to commodity, buffer stock arrangements should ensure, in the case of certain important primary products, the moderationof excessive short-term price fluctuations about a long-term equilibrium price.It is desirable that the technical possibilities of introducing buffer stock arrange-ment in regard to certain of the more important commodities entering intointernational trade should be studied further in the light of the plans whichhave been under consideration by both the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates groups. i -(b) It is hoped that buffer stock arrangements, by operating in a directionopposite to market demand and by acting as a deterrent to speculation, mightmitigate certain of the complex set of forces which are responsible for businesscycles. On the other hand,, too much must not be hoped from such arrangementsif extreme conditions recur such as those which were experienced more than once in the inter-war period.2. Quantitative regulation arrangements.(a) There is general agreement that international arrangements involving the quantitative restriction of exports and/or production should be regardedas transitory measures to be introduced only where there is persisting dis-equilibrium between supply and demand which may necessitate special measures for the protection of producers and the facilitation of orderly change duringthe transitional periods in which adjustments of production to effective demandare being made.There is a certain difference of emphasis between the two groups in regard tosuch schemes. The United Kingdom group is hopeful that in practice it will bepossible in the case of most commodities to allow long-term price trends to followsupply and demand, and to constitute the primary means of effecting adjustments in productive capacity to balance demand.   The United States group consider[271,17] &apos;   i
that it may well be necessary to have greater recourse to quantitative regulationschemes than is envisaged by the United Kingdom group, in order to mitigate the hardships which would fall on producers during transitional periods and tofacilitate orderly shifting of production by governmental action during suchperiods.(6) It is agreed that if a quantitative regulation scheme is found necessarythis should normally be accompanied and preferably preceded, where practicable,by a buffer stock arrangement.(c) It is agreed that in all cases international arrangements involving quanti-tative regulation of exports and/or production should be subject to the observance of certain principles in order to insure that the fundamental objectives of inter-national commodity policy are not infringed. These principles comprise,inter alia 1(1) Arrangements to insure that on any body which, under the aegis of theGeneral Executive, is charged with the duty of framing and/oroperating a quantitative regulation scheme, there should be equalvoting power between exporting countries and countries largely dependent on importts. ,(2) It shall be incumbent upon the General Executive, when any proposals are made to it for the introduction of a quantitative regulation scheme,to explore (in so far as it has not already done so) the possibility ofdealing with the root causes of the disequilibrium between supply and demand which have given rise to proposals for such a scheme, before itendorses the formal introduction of any arrangements involvingquantitative regulation, other than the introduction of provisionalexport quotas. v(3) Specific ppovision must be made in connection with any scheme involvingquantitative restriction which is approved by the General Executivefor insuring that there are increasing opportunities (which should beapplied as far as possible during the period of the &quot;scheme) for supplying world requirements from countries able to furnish such requirements most effectively, with appropriate adjustments in prices to changes in the basic conditions of production and demand, and for measures designed to facilitate any adjustments in production whichmay be requisite to this end.(4) No quantitative regulation scheme should be approved for a period ofmore than five years. No such scheme should be renewed except uponendorsement by the General Executive following the consideration bythat body of a report (which should be published) showing how far thepreceding principles, and in particular those at (3) above, had been observed during the initial period of operation of the scheme.IV. Subsidies.1. The United States group have drawn attention to the importance ofinsuring that the attainment of one of the basic objectives of international commodity policy--a state of affairs under which there would be increasing-opportunities for supplying world requirements from countries in a position tosupply such requirements most effectively should not be jeopardised by any widespread use of subsidies to maintain or extend production which can beregarded eas hy-pothesi as less effective than that of countries where no subsidy is needed. They have pointed out that not only would the widespread use of subsidies tend to diminish (as in the inter-war period) the &apos;&apos; free market&apos;&apos; areaavailable to the more effective producers, but that the successful operation of abuffer stocks scheme would be likely to be threatened if countries were able to throw on .to the market subsidised commodities in substantial quantities.Accordingly, they would wish to secure agreement that countries (whetherexporting of deficit areas) which find it necessary to resort to subsidies should inall cases link the grant of such subsidies with a quantitative limitation on theamount of subsidised production, e.g., to insure that it would not, in any event,exceed the average production during a base period, and that there should, if practicable, be an undertaking progressively to reduce the amount of subsidisedproduction below the base period level. Unless a general formula can be found,the alternative would appear to be to deal with the problem of subsidy on thebasis of individual commodities. This latter approach might well involve inrespect of individual commodities greater recourse to quantitative regulation than is envisaged by the&quot; United Kingdom group.
2. The United Kingdom group recognise the force of the considerationsput forward by the United States group. They agree that in cases where it.is necessary to resort to subsidies these should be moderate in amount. But theyare not able to accept the conclusion that there ought to be international agreementstipulating that subsidies should in all cases be accompanied, by a quantitativelimitation on the amount of subsidised production. Such a proposal would, intheir view, cause serious political difficulties, especially in those countries which,under other proposals now under consideration, would be asked to renounce other measures (high tariffs, quantitative import restrictions except under certain conditions) on which they may have largely depended in the past for the pro-tection of their industries, especially agrarian industries, and which would belikely, if maintained, to be much more detrimental to the &quot; free market &quot; than would, the continuance of moderate subsidies. Moreover, the United Kingdomgroup, are hopeful that it would be found that in practice pressure from taxpayerswould in nearly every case insure that the payment of subsidies was made condi-tional upon a quantitative limitation on production.3. It is agreed between the two groups that further consideration should begiven to the question of insuring that subsidisation is kept within moderate limits and, in particular, to the question of setting a limit to the subsidisation of theproduction of goods of which world surpluses exist.V. Further Action.It is recommended that arrangements should be made for further informal discussions between representatives of the United States and United kingdom governments within three or four months, in order to ascertain how far therecommendations for international action implicit in the foregoing paragraphsare acceptable to both Governments and to consider how such recommendationscan best be discussed with the other United. Nations concerned at an early date with a view to the initiation of plans for the establishment of the international organisations contemplated and for the study, on an international basis, of certain important commodities in respect of which difficult problems are likely to arise in the post-war period.ANNEX K.    .Employment.A Draft International Employment Agreement.ii) Each of the signatory Governments, being determined to do its part toensure that the victory of the United Nations shall be followed by freedom fromwant, recognise that this objective cannot be achieved unless its people are giventhe fullest opportunities to work and enjoy the rewards of their labour.(ii) Moreover, each signatory Government recognises that a high level ofemployment among its people is not only fundamental to their material well-being,but will .also contribute through the channels of trade to the creation of employ-ment for the peoples of other countries and to an increase in their well-being.(iii) Therefore each signatory Government recognises and hereby undertakesa national obligation to its own people and an international obligation to theother signatory Governments henceforth to take such measures as may be necessary and practicable to fulfil this purpose.(iv) Each signatory Government declares to its own people and to other signatory Governments that it will take all measures within its powers to carryout this obligation and, in particular : -(a) To secure the provision of opportunities for work of a kind which will maintain and improve the standard of living of the community.(b) To mitigate the unemployment due to fluctuations in activity to which certain trades, industries and services are liable.(v) In addition, each signatory Government undertakes (a) To consult with other Governments and with appropriate internationalauthorities as methods of collecting on an agreed plan detailed,statistics of national employment and unemployment.
(b) To take such internal, measures as may be practicable and within its powers to collect the statistics relating to its own country required bythe agreed plan.(c) To submit such statistics to other Governments, through an appropriate international organisation, at intervals not exceeding three months.(d) To make a report, for the purpose of an annual conference of the member countries, on the state of employment of its people and on the economic policies which have been used or are contemplated to combatunemployment.(e) To send representatives concerned with the economic and social policyof the Government to meet with representatives of other governments and international authorities at. a special conference called by theappropriate organisation, if, in the opinion of that organisation, aserious decline in employment is developing in any of the signatorycountries (for causes whether avoidable or unavoidable by the Govern-ments of the countries concerned), for the purpose of examining and reporting upon possible national and international measures to restore the level of employment and to prevent the spread of unemployment to other countries.(vi) In the event of a serious decline in the level of its employment, a member government undertakes to consider measures to restore the level of employmentsuch as :-(a) Stimulation of private investment.(&amp;) Increase in public investment.(c) Increased consumption expenditure.(d) Expansion of oversea investment where appropriate.
