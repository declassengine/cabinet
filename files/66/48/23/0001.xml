At my request the Chiefs of Staff recently made a provisional estimate ofthe Service man-power which, on their present plans for the war against Japan,the Services would require one year after the defeat of Germany. Taking thesefigures as a basis, the Joint War Production Staff has worked out the corres-ponding figures for labour in the shipbuilding and munition industries. Bothspts of figures assume that the German war ends in October 1944, and that theJapanese war lasts for 3 years thereafter. The result of all these calculations is summarised in the attached memorandum (Appendix), which thus shows the degreeof mobilisation, both military and industrial, which would have to exist one year after the end of the German war if military requirements are to be satisfied.2. The estimate of the man-power required for the Services and munitionsis 6-5 million, which compares with 9-1 million at the end of 1943 and anexpected level of 8-7 million at the end of 1944. The calculation assumes that we continue to receive assistance in munitions supplies from the United States,Canada and the Eastern Group which bears the same proportion to our total programme as at present.3., On this basis there will be a net reduction of 2-2 million in the Servicesand in munitions work in the first year after the end of the European war. Atthat time the man-power mobilisation will be 75 per cent, of the end-1944 level that is to say, the same Service-plus-munitions labour force as we had in themiddle of 1941.4. In my view this scale of effort is more than we can afford, or. indeedsustain. We cannot afford it because of the pressing demands of the building programme, the urgent need to improve our civilian standards, the essential repair and maintenance of our industrial installations, and the export trade, to say nothing of relief. -We cannot sustain it, in my view, because of the very greatpsychological effect which the end of the war with Germany and the removal ofimminent danger will have upon the population. Large numbers of those released from the Services and from munition works will not be available for civilianemployment, and cannot be directed into it. Many workers are overdue for retirement, or others are in industry for patriotic and not for economic reasons.5. It is clearly necessary for us to determine as soon as possible the scale of our war effort during the Japanese war. A decision is necessary, both toenable us to open discussions with the United States on the extent of theirmunitons supplies to us in that period and to enable the Minister of Reconstruc-tion to make his preparations on a realistic basis..

6. I do not myself think that we can profitably ask the Chiefs of Staff toreassess their requirements without further guidance. I think that we must look carefully at the implications of their latest estimates. Up to the present no serious attempt has been made to work out what release of man-power from theServices and from munitions is essential for reconstruction purposes during theyear after Germany&apos;s defeat. A very rough estimate indicates that this releasemight have to be as high as 3f million men and women instead of the 2 - 2 million which results from the attached calculations. I do not see how it is possible to strike a balance between the Japanese war and reconstruction unless a muchfirmer estimate is made of the requirements of the latter, difficult though the taskmay be. In the meanwhile I suggest that, without prejudice to any final decision,the War Cabinet should make an arbitrary assumption of our essential recon-struction requirements as, for example, that the extent of our war mobilisationshould be limited to a level between 60 and 65 per cent, of end-1944, i.e., a Service-plus-munition man-power level of, say, 1 million less than the present sug-gested figure. I suggest also that the War Cabinet should tentatively place a limit of Service man-power of 3 million instead of the present estimate of 3 - 5 million,leaving 2-5 million for the munition labour force. If any guidance could begiven as to the split between the Services of the 3 million, it would be helpful.7. Having made these arbitrary assumptions, I suggest the following procedure : (a) The Chiefs of Staff should be asked to work out the effect on their militaryintentions for the Japanese war and on their other concurrent commit-ments including of course the occupation of Europe if the Serviceman-power one year after the end of the European war were limitedto 3 million.(b) The Service and Supply Departments, through the Joint War production staff, should be asked to estimate the effect of trying to meet therequirements of the Forces, reduced as above, with a total british labour force of 2-5 million.(c) The Minister of Reconstruction and the Minister of Labour, with theMinister of Production and Ministers responsible for the various sections of the civil economy, should be asked to make an assessment ofthe extent to which urgent reconstruction plans could be met if the net reduction in the Services and in munition work were (i) 2-2 million men and women.(ii) 3 - 2 million men and women.8. An essential element in all the above calculations is the assumed length ofthe Japanese war. I think the War Cabinet should say whether 3 years is theright assumption for planning purposes.O.

APPENDIX.Man-Power for the Japanese War.1. The Chiefs of Staffs&apos; provisional estimate of the Service man-power required one year after the defeat of Germany is :- Men and women in 1,000&apos;s.End-1943      End 1944   One year after   Change from(actual).

The Service Departments have estimated the consequential changes intheir requirements of equipment. Broadly, the Navy&apos;s requirements will represent an increased burden on British shipyards and general engineering,especially in high-grade lines; the R.A.F.&apos;s requirements of aircraft will fallby 40 to 50 per cent, below the end-1944 supply rate, but those of the F.A.A.will have expanded by about 20 per cent, at that date; the Army&apos;s requirements will be reduced by about 50 per cent, of the 1944 supply rate (see Annex A).3. The Supply Departments have prepared the following estimates ofBritish munitions man-power corresponding to these Service requirements :; Men and women in 1,000&apos;&apos;s.End 1943      End 1944   One year after   Change from(actual).       (allocation). German defeat,   end -1944. &quot;Admiralty     ...        918 905 950 -1-45M/Supply     ...      1,469 1,249 770 -479MA.P. .        ...      1,821 1,753 1,400 -353Total   ...      4,208 3,907 3,120 -787These estimates are on the following basis :- - (a) The Admiralty assumes supplies from United States at a probablylower rate than at present. The Ministry of Supply assumes that much the same proportion as now of its total supplies come from united States and the Dominions. The M.A.P. figure is based upona United Kingdom aircraft production programme formulated afterallowance for certain deliveries of aircraft and components from united States and the Dominions (future deliveries to the F.A.A. are1 very uncertain): this in effect assumes that the proportion of overseas aid will be below the expected rate at end-1944.(b) They allow a net loss of workers&apos; productivity of some 10 per cent.resulting from shorter hours, diminution of effort, &amp;c.(c) They include Ministry of Supply production (90,000) which may be. allotted to other than Service users (e.g., Ministry of War Transportwheeled vehicles), and M.A.P. production (over 60,000) of civil aircraft, radio, &amp;c.(d) The Admiralty figures provide for use spread over three years of surplusstock of ammunition arid other consumable stores existing at the endof the European war; the War Office estimate of requirements, arehence the Ministry of Supply figures, provides similarly; i.e., spreadover three years, for the use of capital equipment becoming surplusat the end of the European war; the M.A.P. figures make no allowance for use of surplus aircraft and other stores.4. The J.W.P.S. might work on the assumption of a required munitionslabour force of some 3 millions, subject, of course, to the assumptions made about overseas aid.[27158] - r 2
Size of Effort in Stage Two.5. The Chiefs of Staffs&apos; provisional estimate therefore calls for a Service-pius-munitions strength of nearly 6 - 5 millions one year after Germany&apos;s defeat.This contrasts with an end-1943 strength of 9-1 million, and a projected strength at end-1944 of 8 - 7 million. It represents a 10 per cent, reduction on the previousestimate of 7-2 million presented to the J.W.P.S. last October : Service-plus- Per cent,munitions of(millions). end-1944-End-1943 (actual).........         9-1 .100End-1944 (allocation) ...      ......          8-7 100One year after defeat of Germany Estimate of October 194.3       ...         7-2 83Estimate of March 1944 ...        ..          6-5 75These requirements thus call for a man-power mobilisation during the japanese war at 75 per cent, of the end-1944 level. This would be the same as the levelin the middle of 1941.   (See Annex B.)6. On this basis the net reduction in the Services and in munitions work inthe engineering and chemical industries in the first year would be some 2 -.2 million men and women. This does not take into account reductions in the load of Serviceand Supply Departments&apos; work upon other industries and services, or in thenumber of Government industrial employees of Service and Supply Departments,or in civil defence.Supplies from Overseas.7. The estimated munitions labour force of 3 million assumes that we receive munitions and components from the United States and the Dominionsequivalent to about If million British munition workers. At the end of 1943,40 per cent, of the munitions supplies of the British Empire came from overseas,a British labour force Of 4-2 million being supplemented by United Statessupplies equivalent to 1 - 9 million British workers, and by Canadian and eastern group supplies equivalent to about 0-9 million (see Annex C). At the end of1944, the proportionate dependence will be greater still.8. The scale of supplies from overseas in Stage Two is thus at least as important a factor in the required size of the British munitions labour force asthe change in the Services&apos; requirements. If, for example, we failed to getone-half of the assistance upon which we are counting in these figures, we shouldbe unable to make any reduction at all in British munitions employment.9. The nature of our supplies from overseas is such that any substantialvariations from the assistance assumed here would cause great difficulties. Aconsiderable reduction below the assumed scale of assistance, besides placing a severe additional burden upon our munitions industries, would in fact crippleour war effort, for we cannot produce certain types of equipment which we receive from overseas. On the other hand, an attempt to increase these suppliesappreciably would raise in an acute form the question of acceptability of U.S.types in lieu of British, especially in aircraft.
124ANNEX A.Service Requirements in Stage Two.A dmiralty.Expansion of shipyard and general engineering work will be needed inUnited Kingdom, especially as the Admiralty can expect little help from united States. Substantial cuts will be possible in production of guns, explosivesand chemicals, ammunition, mines, torpedoes and depth charges, and there willbe less important cuts in all sorts of consumable stores.Requirements of the Fleet Air Arm will expand considerably. In framingtheir estimates, the Admiralty have assumed that reliance on United States assign-ments is limited to the number of aircraft likely to be required to replace wastagein American types now in service until the present marks become obsolescent.This represents a necessary precaution in view of the American reaction to theAdmiralty&apos;s recent bids, rather than a reluctance to accept American types.Estimated Receipts from united States T.B.R&apos;s. &amp;c.FightersTo   be   provided   fromBritish production 1T.B.R&apos;s.......FightersEnd-1944-Planning.25*150*160120Monthly Rates of Delivery,UltimateSpring 1946. &apos;   Rate.About 25130385220410455 540 630* Assuming deliveries at rate offered for first half of 1944.This table excludes amphibians for which there is a small requirement, andalso target-towing and other non-operational types.War Office.Net requirements of weapons, ammunition and tracked vehicles, after allowing for use of capital equipment becoming surplus at the end of theEuropean War, will on the average be less than 50 per cent of their 1944 level.Net requirements of vehicles, signal equipment and general non-warlike storeswill be about 50 per cent, of the 1944 level.Air Ministry.Required, monthly production contrasted with end-1944 planning : British types.
