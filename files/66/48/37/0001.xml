(44) 187.5th April, 1944.WAR CABINET.STRATEGIC ASPECT OF THE DISCUSSIONS ON OIL POLICY.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.IT is our view that it is to our advantage that the Americans should haveinterests in Middle East oilfields, and hence a strategic commitment.2. Russia is a potential future danger to the Middle East area. Even if she could meet her total oil requirements from her own resources, she might stillbe tempted to look with envy upon the outlet to the Indian Ocean afforded by thewarm-water ports of the Persian Gulf. To be able to count with justifiableconfidence upon American assistance against this danger is an overridingadvantage.3. It is true that an extension of American influence in the Middle East,especially in Palestine, would present us with a complication of the internal security problem. This is a difficulty which we cannot, in any case, escapealtogether, since the Americans already have very considerable interests in middle East oilfields.4. We conclude that the advantage of obtaining an American counterweightto Russian pressure far outweighs any possible complication of our internal security problem.5. At Annex is an initial brief for the British Delegation on the strategic considerations.(Signed)        A. F. BROOKE.C PORTAL.ANDREW CUNNINGHAM.Of/ices of the War Cabinet, S.

ANNEX.British-United States Discussions on Oil Policy.STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS.Initial Brief for the British Delegation.From the strategic point of view it is in the interest of the whole BritishCommonwealth that oil should be available in the necessary quantity and qualityin as many areas as possible, particularly in those areas which can most easily be defended. Hence, it would be in our interest that reserves in the american continent should not be unduly depleted.2.&apos; In this connection it is understood that the American interest in theMiddle East oil is based partly on strategic grounds, their contention being thatthey may eventually have to rely on these areas as their own resources are dryingup. It is understood that this contention is largely invalid since the resources in North and South America are likely to be amply sufficient for defence pur-poses for many years, and from the military point of view, any additional requirements for the Pacific could be met from the East Indies. However, should this contention be substantiated it must be remembered that American continentalresources constitute our most secure supply in war and therefore it is in our.interest to take airy step that may assist in their conservation.3. On the other hand, the Americans already have large commercial interestsin the Middle East oilfields, and this, from the military point of view, is to our advantage, in that if we are ever called upon to defend them the chances of ourobtaining American assistance will be increased. Moreover, a potential aggressormight hesitate to interfere where both American and British interests are involved. There will be no advantage therefore in challenging the Americanplaim to strategic interest in the Middle East oil. Our own interests being wider,the ultimate object should be to conclude a world-wide agreement with the UnitedStates by which each Government would undertake to assist the other with oil supplies in time of emergency or war. It is essential that such an agreement should be world wide and not cover the Middle East alone; in this connection, it isan important consideration that the United States propose to introduce into thediscussions at a later stage the Dutch and the Russians.Priority of Development in the Middle East Area.4. The only potential external threat to the Middle East oil area is from theNorth and North-West.5. The existing Persian oilfields and concessions, which at present are100 per cent. British owned, are in the territory of a weak and unstable foreign government, and we are in present circumstances precluded from maintainingforces in Persia in peace to protect these interests. The Iraq oilfields are withina British sphere of influence, but here again under our existing treaty we cannot in advance of an emergency despatch sufficient forces into Iraq to protect them from aggression. The proximity of these areas to possible aggression makes themextremely difficult to defend, particularly against a sudden attack by air.6. The remaining areas on the Western and Southern shores of the persian gulf are more remote from any threat from the North, but as yet are not fully developed. From the strategical point of view, therefore, it is desirable thatthese should be developed and that efficient refineries should be established in theirvicinity. In the interests of internal security such development should be carriedout without interference with the existing satisfactory relationships between HisMajesty&apos;s Government, the Arab Sheikdoms and; the Oil Companies. In addition,if possible, nothing should be done which might weaken our relations withIbn Saud.Persian Gulf-Mediterranean Pipe-line.7. The Americans have in mind the construction of a pipe-line from the saudi Arabian oilfields to the Mediterranean./
8.   Assuming this to be a practical engineering proposition the strategicaladvantages of such a pipe-line would be :-(a) It would be an alternative to the existing Kirkuk-Haifa-Tripoli lines which would be further removed from any threat from the North.It would enable us to build up increased reserves in the eastern mediterranean.(ft) It would save sea transport and reduce escort commitments in war.(c) It would increase the likelihood of U.S. assistance in protecting the sea route through the Mediterranean.(d) Experience has shown that a pipe-line is not particularly vulnerable tocasual sabotage and, provided the territories through which it passesremain friendly and quiet, there would therefore be no serious commit-ment for its protection.9.   On the other hand the saving in tankers might result in a shrinkage nin the total tanker tonnage available for emergency with a consequent reductionin the flexibility of oil distribution.    Provided means can be devised for maintaining an adequate fleet of tankers, however, we see no objection to theconstruction of this pipe-line from the military point of view.10. As regards the alignment of the pipe-line, if the Western terminus is at alexandria we see the possibility of complications with the Egyptian Governmentwhich might prove embarrassing to both the Americans and ourselves in emergency. Provided, therefore, that satisfactory arrangements can be made for safeguarding the Western terminus, it should be in Palestine. To meet thepossibility of the Persian Gulf or the Mediterranean being closed to shippingthere would be great advantage if a suitable alignment could be found, from, which an outlet could be constructed to the Red Sea should this ever be necessary. If itshould be considered that a threat to our control of the Mediterranean or the suez Canal might ever again become a possibility, direct piping to the Red sea or possibly even to the Southern Arabian coast might be advisable.Provision of Refineries.11. Apart from Haifa the only refineries of any consequence in the middle east area are at Abadan and Bahrein. Should these be put out of action by anenemy the position would be extremely serious. It is of great importance,therefore, from the military point of view, that further refineries should be constructed. Their location will be a matter for more detailed planning when we know more of what the Americans have in mind.General. 412. You will observe that the preceding paragraphs relate to the onlypotential external menace to our Middle East oil interests that exists. You shouldnot conclude that this menace is considered real at the moment; on the contrary,it is quite possible that it will never materialise.In either case, however, it would be highly dangerous if any hint that wewere even considering this menace, let alone taking it seriously, were conveyed tothe Americans in the course of your discussions with them.
