Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 194.fith April, 1944.WAR CABINET.Copy No.  OUEMPLOYMENT OF FOREIGN LABOUR IN GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues may be interested to have information about the scale on which foreign labour is at present employed in Germany, Austria and the Sudetenland.The following are the figures for the foreign civilians and prisoners of war atpresent working in Germany : Civilians.Prisoners of War.RussiansPoles&apos;FrenchBelgiansDutchItaliansDanesBaitsCzechsSlovaksCroatsSerbsHungariansSwissBulgariansRoumaniansGreeksSpaniardsNorwegiansFinnsSwedes   ...Total1,450,0001,350,000800,000450,000300,000150,00040,000100,000250,000100,000150,00045,00025,00018,00016,00014,00012,0009,0007,0005005005,287,000Grand TotalRussiansPolesFrenchItaliansBelgiansSerbsBritish400,00053,000870,000170,00060,00095,00060,0001,708,0006,995,000.2. To this should be added some 200,000 Russian prisoners of war employed as labourers and in the Todt organisation. We have no estimate of the numberof Russian civilians employed by the Germans in occupied Russia.3. The figures for Russians employed by the Germans in a military capacityare, on the scanty evidence available, estimated as follows :  (1) Excluding anti-aircraft personnel.BalkansFrance and Low CountriesItaly ......Eastern Front and rear areasPoland40,000200,00020,000100,00010,000370,000(2) Anti-aircraft   personnel   (all   areas -a   very rough estimate)     ...       ...      ...    ....       100,000Total12332   [27235]470,000
4. Among the various other nationalities employed by the Germans in amilitary capacity, the only considerable number is probably provided by thePoles, who may run to half a million.5. My colleagues may care to know that, as compared with the 470,000Russians who are actively assisting our enemies in a military capacity, there are,so far as we are aware, only some twenty Englishmen in the so-called &apos;&apos; BritishFree Unit&apos;&apos; which the Germans tried to form from among our prisoners of war,nominally to combat Bolshevism. As regards the Indian prisoners of war, Iam informed that the Germans only succeeded in suborning 3,500 out of a totalof over 16,000.6. The repatriation of the 7 million foreign workers and prisoners of warnow in Germany will form an acute problem when the German collapse takes place.A. E.Foreign Office, 6th April, 1944.
