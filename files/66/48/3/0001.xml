OeLOffices of &apos;the War Cabinet,S.W.1,,9TH MARCH,  1944.

DIPLOMATIC COMMIMICATIONS10      As one of a number of measures for restricting the leakage of information about &quot;OVERLORD&quot; preparations from Great Britain,the &quot;OVERLORD&quot; Security Sub-Committee proposed that neutral governments should be informed that, until farther notice, no-uncensored communications might pass between them and theirdiplomatic representatives in Great Britain.        Facilities forthe sending of     censored communications would be offered and every effort would be made to explain- to the Governments concerned the reasons for the ban,      It was intended that the ban shouldbe imposed at an early date and should remain In forcecontinuously until the date of &quot;OVERLORD&quot;,The Sub-Committee subsequently considered an alternative proposal that, from time to time, delays amounting to not morethan ten days should be imposed, without notice,  on, diplomaticcommunications.      It was suggested that action of this kind would tend to confuse the enemy and would give rise to fewerdifficulties with neutral Governments than the originalsuggestion of an openly declared ban on uncensored communicationsfor a long period.A further suggestion has since been made that delays shortenough to be attributable to accidental dislocation of the postal and telegraph services might be systematically imposed ondiplomatic communications.      This plan could be worked withoutleading foreign Governments to suppose that any specialprecautions were being taken.2.      It is clear that diplomatic representatives in this country are in a good position to collect information about &quot;OVERLORD&quot;preparations and it may be assumed that any information sent bya neutral representative in this country to his Government will reach the enemy.        On the other hand,  it is argued that much ofthe information sent by neutral representatives is inaccurate andmisleading, and that such knowledgeas we have of what they are sending is of value to us in planningmeasures to deceive the enemy.

5,     The arguments in favour of a series of short delaysPwhether of 10 or of 3 days,  as an alternative to a loan for a continuous period&apos;    extending over several weeks or months?are, first, that sporadic delays are likely to &quot;be moreconfusing to the enemy than a continuous ban, and.,  secondly,that short delays could be imposed without formal notice andwith much less risk of retaliation.        If the result of retaliation was to prevent uncensored communications from.British representatives in neutral countries from reaching thiscountry,  or even to delay their arrival, we should lose a greatdeal.As against these arguments, it should be borne in mind that although the imposition of short delays might serve toprevent the sending of a signal immediately before theoperation was due to start,  it would not prevent the&apos; leakage of information which would enable the enemy to build up a picture of the general disposition of our forces and material for the assault.     With regard to the danger of retaliation,it might be possible to persuade neutral Governments that,situated as we are this year, we have reasonable grounds forimposing the ban.      In fact,  on the outbreak of war an indication was given to foreign Governments that, though theirrepresentatives would for the time being continue to be able tosend cypher telegrams, this privilege might have to be withdrawn,later.      Moreover,  in the event of retaliation by any government it would be possible for our representatives tosend messages through the representatives of the United states in the country concerned.4.      If a ban is imposed on diplomatic communications thequestion arises whether it should extend to Allied as well asneutral Governments,      On the whole,  the preferable course appearsto he .to apply   the.   &quot;ban to all Allied Governments - includingthe French Committee of Liberation and the exiled governments in this country - except the United States and the U.S.S0Ro

Admittedly this increases the difficulty of applying the ban,&quot;but the alternative of exempting all Allied Governmentsleaves too great a danger of leakage.It should be noted that, as a neutral, the Governmentof Eire would be covered by the ban.VISITORS&apos;. BAN5.     The general argument in favour of imposing the Visitors1Ban on the coastal region from the Wash to Cornwall,  and on certain areas in Scotland adjacent to the Firth of Forth,was summarised as follows in a Report by the Sub-Committeeon &quot;OVERLORD&quot; Security (0.P.(44)  9).&quot;....If the recommendations made earlier in this report are adopted, they will.diminish considerably the riskof leakage of information both from the British Islesoverseas and from Great Britain to Ireland,&quot;But the measures that we recommend, even when addedto those already in force, will not provide completesecurity.      If, therefore, the imposition of a visitors&apos;ban would make a considerable additional contributionto security, we think that it would be justified.&quot;It must be recognised that the ban will not preventenemy agents from entering the coastal belt, and thatafter it has been imposed the danger of indiscreet talkby residents in the coastal belt or by visitors- who areexempted from the ban will remain.      It has also been pointed out to us that the administration of the ban will present a difficult task&apos;to the depleted police forcesin the area and may distract them from more urgent securitywork if they are called on to make enquiries into thereasons for the presence of visitors who may bear a legitimate reason for their presence.     Moreover, theGovernment may be exposed to criticism by persons who willnot fail to point out that the ban is not effective in

preventing careless talk, since they themselves have hadconversations in London with persons who have come fromthe banned area.&quot;The main case for the ban rests on two grounds.First,  the reduction in the population of the coastalbelt which the ban would effect would make it very much easier to detect the presence of enemy agents in thebelt and to round up any agents who may be dropped byparachute.     Not only would the field of search benarrowed by the actual reduction in the numbers, but theabsence of crowds of strangers would mean that theenemy agent moving against a background of local people would be more liable to detection.      Secondly, althoughthe ban will not prevent indiscreet talk by residentsor exempted visitors, the number of people who mighttalk carelessly and so give away vital information willbe very greatly reduced.      Enemy intelligence, like ourown,  is built up by the piecing together of small scrapsof information,  and it may fairly be claimed that ameasure which makes a big reduction in the number ofpersons who may give av/ay valuable information incasual talk will contribute substantially towardssecurity.&quot;The population figures of the areas in which theban would apply are:-6.      The Sub-Committee were later asked to examine analternative suggestion for restricting the ban to limitedareas without denying all access to the coast.     Theyreported ^ this as follows in O.P*(44) 0.1:-EnglandScotland3,450,000285,0003,735,000

9 hi&quot;The suggestion which we were ashed to consider isthat visitors should-not be denied access to the wholecoastal belt &quot;but only to those parts where military activity and the need for secrecy are greatest^&quot;After examining a map showing the military and naval dispositions we are clear that along the whole belt thereis hardly any part of the coastline to which visitorscould be admitted without a risk of their picking upinformation which would be of value to the enemy.     the precise definition of the vital areas from which visitorswere to be excluded would pinpoint the places wherepreparations were concentrated and give clues to theenemy as to the -direction of the assault.     Moreover,  ifthere is to be no general visitors&apos; ban, the militaryauthorities would feel bound to insist on the strictexclusion of visitors from the vital.areas and this would put an impossible-burden on the.Police and the Services^&quot;We are therefore of opinion that the visitors&apos;  banmust extend over the whole of the coastal belt.&quot;We should add that, apart from considerations of security, the imposition of a visitors&apos;  ban would (i)reduce substantially the numbers of people seekingaccommodation in an area where accommodation is alreadyseverely overtaxed,  (ii) be in line with therecommendation, made by the Supreme Commander and endorsed by the Chiefs of Staff,  that Service leaveshould be stopped and (ill)  afford some relief to inland transport,&quot;
