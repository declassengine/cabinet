Copy No.    3W.P. (44) 186.4th April, 1944.WAR CABINET.POLICY TOWARDS TURKEY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.GREAT BRITAIN and Turkey are bound to each other by ties of allianceembodied in the Anglo-Franco-Turkish Treaty of Mutual Assistance which was signed on the 19th October, 1939, and is valid for a period of fifteen years. this treaty (which with the collapse of France became a bilateral instrument betweenGreat Britain and Turkey) was intended to serve the interests we had in main-taining the closest and most cordial relations with Turkey. It lays down certain specific cases when each of the contracting parties shall go to the military assistance of the other. On two occasions during the present war a casus fmderishas arisen in Turkey&apos;s case, namely, when Italy declared war on Great Britain andFrance in 1940 and when the Germans invaded Greece in 1941. On neitheroccasion did Turkey take any action. The obligation on Great Britain&apos;s side is togive all possible military assistance to Turkey, should she be involved in hostilities with a European Power in consequence of aggression.by that Power against her.This obligation remains so long as the Treaty is in existence, and might be aconsiderable embarrassment to us, were Turkey at some future date to come intoconflict with the Soviet Union. A full explanation of Great Britain&apos;s Treatyposition vis-a-vis of Turkey is set out in the Annex to this paper.2. Anglo-Turkish interests can be divided into purely wartime interests and long-term or permanent interests, which it will be important for us to maintainafter the conclusion of the present war.3. Although it is not possible to foresee in complete detail the exact formof our post-war interests as regards Turkey, it is probable that they will be thefollowing. In the first place, we shall still wish to see the maintenance of a fullyindependent and sovereign Turkey politically and economically, free from the domination of any great Power, since we shall not wish to see Turkey economicallysubservient to Germany as she was before 1939, or for that matter subservient toany great Power. Secondly, close Anglo-Turkish friendship will serve as animportant make-weight if British policy is to make itself felt in the Balkans.Thirdly, Anglo-Turkish friendship will be of value as a stabilising influence in. theMiddle East generally. Lastly there are strategic considerations to be borne inmind. Our position not only in the Mediterranean but in the Persian Gulf andin Iraq will benefit by.the fact that we can count on a friendly Turkey, which isin sympathy with our general Mediterranean and Middle East policy. Likewisea friendly Turkey is important to ensure that Turkish control of the Dardanellesis not applied to our disadvantage. For although strategically the Straits maynot be as important to us as they were in the 19th century, they are. still likely toremain a British interest of considerable importance. It is impossible, however,here and now to lay down as a fixed principle that after the war Turkey must beso vital as to warrant our making special sacrifices in other directions, in order toensure that our future policy is based on close co-operation with and support ofTurkey for an indefinite period.4. During the war our immediate interest in Turkey is to obtain from herthe maximum help possible against Germany. The help we required from her inthe early part of the war was of a passive sort, namely, to act as a barrier against german penetration in the Middle East. Since the collapse of Italy, however, wehave wanted something more, namely, the use of Turkish air bases and eventualactive participation by Turkey in the war.5.   In recent months British policy in Turkey has been directed to obtainingthese immediate interests, but we have in the face of Turkish recalcitrance failed[27214]
entirely to achieve our object. At the end of January we decided therefore toabandon our efforts and withdrew our military mission and cut off armamentsupplies to Turkey without notification or explanation and, in conjunction withthe Soviet and United States Governments, adopted an attitude of aloofnesstowards the Turkish Government. Our hope was by this means to create a sense of anxiety and bewilderment in the minds of the Turks which might in due courseproduce its effect on Turkish policy.6. It was not expected that the reactions of the Turks to this policy wouldbe spectacular, nor have they been. There is no evidence to suppose that the cessation of supplies is seriously worrying them. Indeed, it might even be saidthat our action has been a relief to them, because it has also resulted in the cessation of political pressure on them. On the other hand, certain advantageshave been gained. That there is some division of opinion in certain Turkishquarters regarding the rightness of present Turkish policy is evident from the resignation of the Turkish Ambassador in London and from various otherindications which His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Angora has noticed. Thebewilderment in which the Turks find themselves is obvious also from the periodicoutbursts of criticism of the Turkish press against this country, which die downas suddenly as they arise, because the Turks find they are defending themselves against charges which, contrary to their anticipations, have not been made.There are also indications that the Turks are trying to convince themselves, intheir own minds that the cessation of military supplies has purely strategicimplications and in no way denotes an alteration in British policy. They are,however, far from certain.7. The question now arises as to what should be our next step. The presentphase was originally intended only to be temporary. It is an attitude, moreover,which it is difficult to explain in public, since this would automatically clear away from Turkish minds the present atmosphere of uncertainty, the continued existence of which can only be to our advantage. Again, it is not by any means certain that our present course has the full support of either the Russians or the americans. As regards the latter, His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Angora have reported that they believe that the United States Ambassador there wishes thepresent phase of deadlock to end. The Americans seem glad to explain that thepresent line of policy is essentially a British one. The Russians, we are told,inform all and sundry that they never did want to press the Turks into the warand are not interested in Turkey&apos;s participation. The Turks have not been slow to make play with this by blaming us for the deadlock.8. In these circumstances two alternative courses of action at once presentthemselves. First, we might attempt to resume pressure on the Turks to forcethem to meet our demands for active military assistance, and this pressure might,inter alia, take the form of threatening to denounce the Anglo-Turkish Alliance.As to our right to do this see paragraph 5 of Annex. Such a threat, however,would almost certainly fail in its immediate object, and if we were to put itactually into practice it would probably shatter irrevocably our post-war policy towards Turkey. Alternatively, we might attempt to restore former cordialpolitical relations by means of some public statement in Parliament about the alliance, and suitable assurances to the Turkish Government, to be followed nodoubt by the resumption of supplies of war material. Such a course, however,would be interpreted by the Turks as a sign of weakness or even surrender on our part. Nor is it clear that we should in return obtain any immediate benefits,whereas the Anglo-Turkish Treaty, which we may find unnecessary and incon-venient after the war would, even if only tacitly, acquire a new lease of life.9. What is required is a policy which serves as far as is feasible in existing circumstances our immediate interests of using Turkey in the war againstGermany, and at the same time leaves undecided, but at the same timeunprejudiced, our post-war policy. A solution along these lines can be found by combining our present policy of aloofness with an active campaign in theeconomic as distinct from the military or political fields in which we have uptill now operated. The economic assistance which Turkey is at present givingthe Germans is very considerable and it is high time it should cease. although we have not weapons with which to force Turkey into the war, various meansare at our disposal, such as usual blockade measures, black-listing, &amp;c, which havenot yet been applied to Turkey, but the use of which now may well substantiallyreduce, if not disrupt, Turco-German economic relations. Moreover, the very factthat we were now applying these weapons might have the additional advantageof deceiving the Germans into thinking that we are now attempting to coerceinstead of cajole the Turks into the war..   : .////. ;&apos;    &apos; - ----- - - -. &apos;     .
10.   Our Turkish policy should therefore be as &quot;follows  -(1) We should maintain our attitude of aloofness and the ban on arms supplies in order that the present satisfactory state of uncertaintyin Turkish minds should continue. For this purpose it is essentialthat no statement in public or to the Turks should be made regardingour, Turkish policy.(2) We should institute a rigorous economic warfare campaign aimed at the disruption of Turco-German trade. This policy would consist of(i) blockade measures, (ii) pre-emption, (iii) generous supply facilitiesfor goods to the .supply of which there is no economic warfareobjection or which will exclude the Germans from the Turkish marketor enable the Turks to ban exports of their goods to Germany.(3) We should strive to interrupt communications between Turkey andGermany by aerial bombardment of Bulgarian targets and increasedS.O.E. activity against railways in Bulgaria.(4) We must obtain a due measure of agreement from the Soviet and UnitedStates Governments in this policy, since a united Anglo-Soviet-American front vis-a-vis the Turks is necessary for its success.11. I should be grateful for the approval of my colleagues in the policy set out above.A. E.Foreign Office, 4:th April, 1944.ANNEX.THE Anglo-Franco-Turkish Treaty of Mutual Assistance was signed onthe 19th October, 1939, and is valid for a period of fifteen years. It lays down a number of specific cases in which Turkey shall come to the assistance of GreatBritain and France, e.g., in the event of an act of aggression by a european power in the Mediterranean, in which France and the United Kingdom are involved, and places on Great Britain and France the obligation of givingassistance to Turkey should she be involved in hostilities with a European power in consequence of aggression by that Power against her. The Treaty is equallybinding as a bilateral obligation between Turkey and each of the-two other powers. The Treaty was accompanied by a series of subsidiary agreements,the principal ones being an Armaments Credit with the purpose of furnishingTurkey with the means of putting her defences in a position to resist aggression,and a Military Convention indicating the manner in which military co-operationbetween the three Powers shall be effected.2. In 1940, following her collapse in the west, France dropped out of theTreaty, and we assumed her obligations (e.g., her share of the Armaments Credit)and for that matter her privileges (e.g., her share of Turkish chrome). In varying degrees, none of the three parties can, strictly speaking, be said to have whollyfulfilled its obligations under the Treaty. There have been two occasions, viz.,the entry of Italy into the war and the German invasion of Greece, when Turkey,according to the letter of the Treaty, should have come to our military assistance.On the first occasion Turkey invoked Protocol No. 2 to the Treaty, which absolvesher from any action involving as its consequence entry into armed conflict withthe Soviet Union. On the second occasion we made no formal request, and indeed it was tacitly agreed that British interests would be best served by turkey taking no action. British failings are confined entirely to failure to deliver arms. In 1939 the British and French Government drew up with theTurkish authorities an agreed schedule of deliveries, as the result of which thesuspense clause to the Treaty was cancelled. The French almost immediatelyfell behind with their deliveries and after France&apos;s collapse in 1940 there was amore or less complete cessation for a time of supplies from this country. Wehave now, of course, delivered almost all we promised in 1939 and a great deal more besides, but this has been over a period of 4J years. (We still, for instance,have only delivered one of the sixty Spitfires promised in 1939.) Again, underthe Military Convention France undertook to send an expeditionary force to salonica if that place were threatened. The French were never able to fulfil this undertaking, nor have we been to this day.3. Although this Treaty of Mutual Assistance has never been observed, ithas remained a corner-stone^ of Anglo-Turkish policy. The circumstances ofits signature and the alterations in the international situation to which it has
had to adapt itself may account for this. It originated in common Anglo-Franco-Turkish interest to check Axis, and principally Italian, expansion inthe Mediterranean area. It was intended by His Majesty&apos;s Government to be one of a series of treaties of guarantee and mutual assistance, and. in particular it was the intention of the Turkish Government to conclude a treaty comple-mentary to it with the Soviet Union. Then came the diplomatic somersault ofthe autumn of 1939 culminating in the Russo-German pact of non-aggression.The Turco-Soviet negotiations naturally petered out, but the- Anglo-Franco-Turkish Treaty was signed more or less as drafted when it was hoped that therewould be a parallel Turco-Soviet, not to speak of an Anglo-Franco-Soviet,Agreement. From then on until the collapse of France this Treaty, which was directed against Germany and above all Italy, became the pivot of Allied policyin South-East Europe. During the period of the Soviet-German Pact we discussed with the Turks operations such as the bombing across Turkish territory of the Caucasian oil wells. Later on the gradual deterioration of Russo-german relations ending in the German attack on the Soviet Union recreated to someextent, but with a certain fundamental difference, the conditions under which theTreaty was originally intended to operate. The fundamental difference was this.In 1939 it was imagined that Germany could be held in the west and that our military effort against her must be directed elsewhere, namely, in South-east europe, her traditionally weak spot. The collapse of France and the occupation by Germany of the whole of Western Europe saddled us with an unforeseen andcolossal commitment in the west, leaving no resources for anything but minoroperations in the Balkans, a situation which the framers of the Treaty had not contemplated.4. Thus it has come about that we are saddled with a Treaty which still hasmore than ten years to run and the terms of which bind us to come to Turkey&apos;sassistance if she is involved in hostilities with any European Power, including theSoviet Union, in consequence of aggression by that Power against Turkey, eventhough Turkey, militarily speaking, has in the past given us on her side nothing more than passive assistance. This may prove a very inconvenient position forus, for obvious reasons. Again, although there is no technical inconsistencybetween our obligation under the Anglo-Turkish Treaty and the Anglo-soviet treaty of the 26th May, 1942, since the obligation under the latter to assist theSoviet Union is confined to the case of her being involved in hostilities withGermany or any of the States associated with her in acts of aggression in Europe,there is, in fact, some inconsistency between our obligation to Turkey and thegeneral scheme of our Treaty with the Soviet Union.5. There are three legitimate arguments which we could employ in order toabsolve ourselves from our obligations under this possibly most inconvenientTreaty : (a) If, in consequence of a &quot; four-Power set-up&apos;&apos; or otherwise, there comes into effect some arrangement by which we undertake a general obliga-tion to co-operate in preserving the peace and resisting aggression, itmight be possible to argue that this, in fact, superseded bilateralundertakings such as the Turkish Treaty, which had no longer anyraison oVetre.(b) On the assumption that Germany and Italy are effectively disarmed, theTreaty, which was mainly if not entirely directed against aggression by one of those Powers, would have completely changed its character.The danger against which it was directed would have passed away.And, assuming that our relations with France were such as to excludeany possibility of war between the two countries, it seems impossibleto conceive of circumstances in which the Treaty could oblige turkey to come to our assistance against at any rate a major Power, while our obligation to assist Turkey against the Soviet Union would remain, so that the original bilateral obligations of the Treaty would,in fact, become unilateral and we should be getting nothing out of it.(c) Whatever soft words may be employed on both sides, the fact remainsthat the Treaty has not in practice worked out as was intended; for we have, in fact, been fighting Germany and ^ Italy in theMediterranean for several years and Turkey has not lifted a finger toassist us. In these circumstances we can hardly be expected tocontinue to be bound by our obligations to Turkey; we should at anyrate require the right to employ the same latitude in interpreting them as Turkey made use of during the present war.0:ii a
