(44) 181.3rd April, 1944.WAR CABINET,FUTURE OF EUROPE,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I think my colleagues will be interested to read the annexed translation of amost secret memorandum on the future of Europe which was sent to me on the24th March last by the Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs.A. E.Foreign Office, 3rd April, 1944.ANNEX.Translation of Memorandum by M. Spaak.HAVING been away from public affairs for several months, I have beenstruck on returning to my work by a feeling of uneasiness which pervadesdiplomatic circles.During the course of last summer it seemed as if those who were responsiblefor European policy had discarded all thought of &apos;&apos; spheres of influence &apos;&apos; and of dividing Europe into blocs, and that position was warmly welcomed by allrepresentatives of countries that are at present occupied.A policy directed towards the formation of two blocs in Europe, one in theeast where Russian influence would predominate, and one in the west where theinfluence of Great Britain would be predominant, is in fact fraught with danger.The most important and the most immediate of these dangers, is that such a policy would prevent such sanctions and precautions being taken with regard toGermany as might be necessary, since the friendship of Germany would, withfatal results, become the stake of European politics, the political weight whichcould turn the scales in favour of one bloc or the other.This policy of competition with regard to Germany would itself probablylead to hostility between western and eastern Europe. Very soon a vanquishedGermany would become the arbiter of the situation. That must be avoided atall costs.Unhappily, the situation is no longer quite intact. The Russo-Czech treaty and the commentaries with which M. Benes has surrounded it declaring this treaty open to Poland and eventually to other Slav countries have shown that,without waiting for a solution of the European question as a whole, Russia seemsbent on proceeding with the organisation of eastern Europe.It would be dangerous, for the reasons mentioned above, to reply to this policy by setting against it purely and simply a similar organisation in western Europe.But it would equally be dangerous to do nothing at all, since such a negative policy12326   [27195] &apos; I
would be calculated to provoke trouble in Europe more particularly in western europe and cause Great Britain to lose a part of the immense prestige which she has won for herself in those parts.Has not the moment arrived to establish that, even if there is neither groundnor means of denying certain geographical realities and their ensuing conclusions,peace can none the less only be assured by the organisation of Europe as a whole ?The first of these considerations would lead Great Britain to associate herselfwith every effort towards a military and economic organisation which Holland,Belgium, Luxemburg and France might attempt. The second of these considera-tions would consist in confirming that the Anglo-Russian alliance an essentialfactor in the European concert should itself become part and parcel at themoment peace is restored of a larger international organisation.Passing from these general problems to more practical ones, I would pointout that the Governments of Belgium and Holland are negotiating the conclusionof a customs union between their two countries.It is the wish of the Belgian Government, acting in accord with the Nether-lands Government, to start as soon as possible similar negotiations with France.Such a policy has no chance of success unless England associates herself with it.This underlines the importance and the urgency of a constructive policy towards France, and this explains the desire of the Belgian Government to seethe terms of recognition accorded to the French Committee of Liberationbroadened. As long as France is deprived of a Government recognised by theUnited Nations, a constructive policy in western Europe will be extremely difficultto pursue.
