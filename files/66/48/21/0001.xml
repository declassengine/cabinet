THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT--     11QSECRET Copy No. ol)W.P. (44) 171(Also G.O.S. (44) 52) /23rd March, 1944 n   /WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 238)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 0700 16th March, to0700 23rd March,1944[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Cabinet War Room.
NAVAL SITUATION,General Review.1.   Coastal batteries have shelled enemy shipping in the Channel.U.S. naval forces have heavily bombarded Kavieng.A German tanker has been sunk in the Indian Ocean.Three U-boats have been sunk.Shipping losses have been heavier than of late.Home Waters.2. On the night of the 19th/20th, four enemy ships off Gravelines wereshelled by our coastal batteries. On the following night M.T.Bs. were sent to intercept a large ship (possibly the German tanker Rekum, 5,540 tons, whichhad arrived at Boulogne from Cherbourg on the 28th February) which was proceeding up Channel. The M.T.Bs. had to disengage after meeting with heavy and accurate fire from the - escorts and shore batteries. The Dover batteriesopened fire, and later the enemy ship was reported to have reduced speed.Subsequent air reconnaissance has not located the Rekum and she may havebeen sunk by our shell fire.On the night of the 21st/22nd our batteries engaged another ship (probably the ex-Italian s.s. Atlanta, 4,404 tons) which had left Boulogne and was escorted by some 20 ships. Four probable hits and seven straddles were claimed beforethe ship entered Calais. The Atlanta was last seen at Cherbourg on the 18th;like the Rekum, she was working her way up from Biscay ports to the North sea or the Baltic. Enemy coastal batteries replied to our fire on each of the nightsin question. On the night of the 19th/20th extensive damage was done to the coastal force base at Dover.3. Early on the 17th Falmouth batteries opened fire on a group of E-boats,and on, the evening of the same day two M,T.Bs. were unsuccessfully shelled by enemy&apos; batteries in the Dover Strait. Early on the 19th three S.G.Bs.unsuccessfully attempted to intercept enemy shipping off Havre.4. H.M. S/M Graph (ex-German), which left Aberdeen in tow, broke adrifton the 18th and is now ashore on the west coast of Islay.Mediterranean.5. During the week ending the 21st, 40,401 tons of supplies were unloadedat Anzio. Shelling and air raids have persisted, and unfavourable weather hashindered operations. Casualties have been light, but during an air attack onthe 17th, a large infantry landing craft was sunk and two tank landing craft were damaged.On the 18th, H.M.S. Orion (cruiser) carried out a successful bombardment inthe Anzio area.On the night of the 16th/17th, U.S. coastal craft attacked F-lighters offGenoa, and sank an E-boat west of Anzio and an F-lighter off Bastia on the night of the 18th/19th.6. The French destroyers Le Fantasque and Le Terrible sank three ships and possibly a fourth in convoy off the west coast of Greece on the 19th.On the 13th, H.M. S/M TJltor sank an F-lighter off the S.E. coast of Greece.On the 18th, the Greek destroyer Kanaris was damaged in collision N.E. ofBenghazi.,East Indies.7. On the 12th, a large German tanker was sunk by H.M.S. Roebuck(destroyer) about 1,000 miles S.E. of Mauritius,HM. S/M Storm sank a small ship by gunfire in the Malacca Strait on thesame day.HM. S/M Stonehenge is overdue from patrol and must be considered lost.Pacific.Bismarck Archipelago.8. During the night of the 13th/14th, M.T.Bs. destroyed one enemy bargeand captured another off Los Negros Island, and on the 18th, a U.S. destroyer
bombarded enemy positions at the northern side of Seeadler harbour (AdmiraltyIslands).On the 20th, a strong TJ.S. task force, including battleships, heavilybombarded Kavieng (New Ireland). During the bombardment a large ammunitiondump exploded, and this, coupled with the shelling, almost entirely razed the town.Solomons.9. During the night of the 17th/18th, M.T.Bs. operating in the BukaPassage destroyed two heavily laden barges which were probably carryingammunition.New Guinea.10. During the night of the 18th/19th, TJ.S. destroyers bombarded enemy positions at Wewak and on two adjacent islands.   Shore batteries were silenced.Anti-Submarine Operations.11. Thirty-three attacks have been reported, of which 20 were carried outby surface craft, eight by shore-based aircraft and five by carrier-borne aircraft.Three of the attacks were made in the Mediterranean and two in the Indian Ocean.On the 16th, H.M.S. Affleck (frigate), in co-operation with TJ.S. aircraft,sank a U-boat in the Strait of Gibraltar, and on the following day aircraft from u.S.S. Block Island (escort carrier) and U.S. destroyers sank another west of the cape Verde Islands; forty-seven survivors were rescued. On the 19th, aircraft from the Block Island sank one S.W. of the Cape Verde Islands; eight survivorswere rescued.Enemy Intelligence.U-boats.12. There is no important change in the main disposition of U-boats.Several have been reported west of the Cape Verde Islands, and single U-boatshave been patrolling off Florida and Halifax (Nova Scotia).Japanese naval officers and ratings have again been reported at Hamburgand elsewhere, where they receive training in German methods of U-boat warfare.Reconnaissance of help, near Gdynia, has shown three small U-boats. Apossible W-boat was sighted on the surface at sea off Gdynia.Enemy Attack on Shipping,13. U-boats are reported to have attacked seven ships, of which six are known to have sunk. A westbound convoy from Italy was attacked off Bougie.The Dutch s.s. Dempo (17,024 tons) was sunk and a U.S. ship was torpedoedbut reached port. All service personnel on board the Dempo were rescued. AU.S. tanker, homeward bound in convoy from the Caribbean, was sunk west ofIreland (R). A ship was sunk off Halifax (Nova Scotia) and a British tankerwas sunk off Lagos. In the Indian Ocean a ship &quot;in convoy was sunk off Calcuttaand another was sunk S.W. of Ceylon. In the Mediterranean an eastboundconvoy off Bougie was unsuccessfully attacked by about 25 enemy aircraft, oneof which was destroyed by fighters.Protection of Seaborne Trade.14. During the week ending the 19th, 921 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these, 313 were in ocean convoys and 608 in British coastal convoys. One escort-carrier, one anti-aircraft ship, 63 destroyers (including19 U.S. destroyers) and 127 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes were employedon escort duties.Four homeward bound convoys, consisting of 144 ships, and four outward bound convoys, consisting of .169 ships, arrived at their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying.15. Surface craft have laid mines off the Dutch and Belgian coasts andoff the north coast of France. Aircraft laid mines in the Baltic, in the Heligo-land Bight, off the Dutch coast, off the north cOast of France and in the Bay of biscay. *[27148] &apos; b
Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.16. Enemy aircraft were suspected of minelaying off the Humber on the night of the 18th/19th, and E-boats were operating off the South-West Coast on two nights, but no mines have so far been located.Eighteen moored and four ground mines have been destroyed during theweek and the mine totals are : 4,707 ground and 4,366 moored, which include10 ground and 75 moored mines, which were destroyed off the east coast ofCorsica in January, but have only recently been reported.Enemy Merchant Shipping.17. The anticipated increase in the enemy ore trade with Spain hasmaterialised. During December, January and February 44,054 tons weredelivered via Bordeaux and 57,089 tons via Bayonne.In the approaches to Kiel Bay our minelaying by aircraft is reported tohave caused the loss of several ships, and to have severely taxed the enemy&apos;sminesweeping resources.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign. (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern and Central Sectors.18.   Only local activity has taken place.Luck Sector.19. The Russians have pushed forward astride the railway Sarny-Koweland on the 19th a semi-official German broadcast announced that Russian troops had penetrated into the latter town, but its capture has not yet been claimed bythe Russians.South of Luck the Russians made a fresh thrust south-westwards on the 17thand have advanced astride the railway towards Krasne.Tarnopol-Proskurov Sector.20. The Germans have prevented the Russians from capturing eitherTarnopol or Proskurov and have regained a little ground by counter-attacksbetween these two towns, but have made no progress of importance. RenewedRussian attacks have been made in the last few days.Vinnitsa-Yampol Sector.21. Vinnitsa was captured by the Russians on the 20th after they had firstisolated it by cutting the railway south of the town and taking Zhmerinka.Further east the troops which had reached the Bug west and south-west of Umancrossed the river on a wide front and after a very rapid advance reached theDniester at Yampol on the 18th. By the following day the forward troops had crossed the Dniester on a 30-mile front on both sides of Yampol. They have nowwidened the Russian salient northwards, capturing Mogilev-Podolski and Atachi,and have cut the railway Cernauti-Balti north-west of the latter town.Lower Bug.22. In the area of the Lower Bug the Russians have made a general advance on the whole front, capturing Pervomaisk, approaching to within a few miles ofVoznesensk, and reaching the Bug at a point 30 miles above Nikolaev. TheGermans still hold a narrow bridgehead across the Bug north and south ofNikolaev.Crimea.23. There have been renewed Russian attacks at Kerch but no substantial progress. Despite the threat to the port of Odessa, through which many of thesupplies for Sevastopol have passed, there is no evidence of any German intentionto withdraw their troops from the Crimea.General.24. This has been a most successful week for the Russians, who have held the only German counter-attacks, which were limited to a 70-mile front betweenTarnopol and Proskurov, and have made considerable progress along all the.rest of
the front. Not only have the Russians destroyed any German hope of making atemporary stand on the Bug, but they have broken through west and S.W. ofUman and crossed the Dniester on a wide front.In the course of a fortnights fighting in South Russia the Russians claimto have annihilated 10 German divisions, destroyed the fighting value of 11 othersand inflicted heavy losses on four more. It is clear that the new German SixthArmy, which was reformed after its annihilation at Stalingrad and has been operating in the area of the Lower Bug, has suffered very heavily in the recent fighting.Italy.   (A sketch map of Cassino and the immediate vicinity is included as aninset.)25. Cassino, where the offensive has continued, has dominated the news from italy.The attack by Indian troops on Monastery Hill, the primary objective, which went in on the night of the 15th/16th brought us to within 800 yards of themonastery itself. Here we paused for reinforcements, which were forthcomingby the 17th, and by the 21st forward Indian troops were reported as being within200-300 yards of the monastery. In the meantime, however, there have been someunwelcome changes nearer to the town. By the 16th New Zealand troops, whohad carried out the first attack on the town, had captured the important CastleHill feature that overlooks Cassino from the heights on its .N.W. side; otherIndian troops had also captured a further point between Castle Hill andHangman&apos;s Hill, which is the battle name for the position on which the forwardIndian troops were located. The enemy counter-attacked the Indian forces onthis intermediate point on the night of the 16^/17^ and although we regainedit later, it was lost again to an enemy attack on the night of the 18th/19th andis at present in the enemy&apos;s hands. This means that the Indians on Hangman&apos;sHill are isolated and the supplying of them has become very difficult;Man-handling forward by night and dropping from the air have been adopted.An attempt by our troops to regain the lost point on the 21st had to be abandonedwhen the enemy infiltrated behind them on to Castle Hill.In the town, forward progress of our tanks attempting to enter both from thenorth and south has been impeded by the mounds of rubble caused by our air bombardment. By the 17th, however, four troops of tanks had forced their wayinto the town from the north, and infantry had captured the railway station,which lies to the S.E. of Cassino. Mopping-up within Cassino continued throughout the period under review, but small pockets of the enemy continued tooffer the most persistent resistance. By the 23rd, various enemy strong points were still holding out, and an attack by our infantry, even though supported bytanks, against a strongly defended house in the centre of the town was unsuccess-ful. Over 100 prisoners have been taken in the southern parts of the townand five enemy tanks have been knocked out, but by now tlhe opposing troops are so closely locked together that it has become difficult for our artillery to engagethe enemy&apos;s pieces without, at the same time, destroying our own forward infantry.The German parachute troops in and around Cassino are reported as fightingremarkably well.We now hold two bridges over the Rapido, both suitable for tanks, but anycrossing of the river to the south of the town comes under heavy enfilade Germanartillery fire sited at the foot of the mountains west and N.W. of Cassino.26. Elsewhere on the main front there has been relatively little to report.The weather in the Adriatic sector has improved somewhat of late and thehardening ground made possible again the use of tanks across country. Theenemy continues to show activity on a small scale against the positions held byan Indian formation north of Orsogna, and during the night of the 21st/22ndthere was considerable activity in the Orsogna-Arielli area by patrols from bothsides. Furtiher inland in the Apennines sector, the Polish formation which isholding the line kept up patrol activity. To the west of the Cassino area, on theGarigliano front there has been nothing to report. ;27. In the bridgehead activity has been on a small scale. On the 19thBritish Commandos, supported by artillery, succeeded in clearing the enemy froma wiadi to the west of the Anzio-Garroceto road, and this was followed by alarge-scale raid in the same area; this raid was generally successful and inflicted[27148] b 2   ,-
heavy casualties upon the enemy. The attitude of the enemy in this area isprobably still essentially defensive. There is no continuous line but series of strong-points are being constructed covered by fire of all arms, especiallyanti-tank.YugoslaYia.28. Partisan activity is again on the upgrade following the recent improve-ment in the weather, and several successful engagements with the enemy havebeen reported.In the north-east there has been strong resistance to a German thrust west of Belgrade. The Partisans were forced to abandon their base at Bosut in theearly stages of the battle, and to move south of the River Sava. They have nowhalted the enemy advance and have recaptured the town of Koraj (80 miles.S.E. of Belgrade). The Germans have suffered over 200 casualties, but the partisans are now reported to be running short of ammunition.Farther west in the Brod area Marshal Tito&apos;s forces have made twodamaging attacks upon the enemy.The Germans have now abandoned their offensive near Prijedor (25 miles .W. of Banjaluka). The fighting has been heavy and the enemy, far fromsubduing the guerrillas, has sustained much loss in men and material.In Montenegro the Partisans have captured two more towns some 30 miles east of Dubrovnik, and have gained control of parts of the roads and railwaysleading inland from the coast.Allied Commandos have carried out a successful raid upon the island ofSolta (off Split). The entire German garrison was eliminated and 82 prisonerstaken; our forces lost two other ranks killed and twelve wounded. Air support for the raid was given by Mediterranean Coastal Air Forces.Greece.Resistance.29. On the 14th, Zervas forces engaged a mixed German and Turco-Albanian attack 25 miles S.W. of Yanina. After twelve hours&apos; fighting theenemy were compelled to withdraw.The Germans have shot 100 hostages as a reprisal for the recent destructionof the troop train in the Vale of Tempe.Political.30. It has been confirmed that E.L.A.S. forces now owe allegiance to a&apos;&apos; Provisional Political Committee of National Liberation&apos;&apos; which has beenformed by E.A.M. in the mountains.Burma.A arakan.31. Our troops have made further progress in clearing the Maungdaw-Buthidaung road both from the west and from the east. Japanese resistance hasbeen stubborn and fierce local fighting is taking place in the tunnels area of theroad.  The area for some 10 miles south of Maungdaw is now under our control.In the Kaladan Valley West African troops have had only minor encounterswith the Japanese.Chin Hills and Chindwin.32. The Japanese offensive in this area has still further developed. A forceestimated at a regiment strong, operating against the lines of communication ofour forward troops in the Tiddim area,&quot;blocked the road on the 14th. Troopsmoved south from the Imphal area and prevented any further penetration, while our leading forces have withdrawn some miles north of Tiddim.In the Kabaw Valley the Japanese have advanced further towards theImphal-Tamu road.Further north a Japanese force, estimated at a regiment strong, is movingwest from Thaungdut towards the plain south of Imphal, while another force,estimated at a regiment strong, has crossed the Chindwin between Homalin andTamanthi and is also moving west.
Upper Burma.33. A number of columns of our troops have been landed by glider andtransport aircraft behind the Japanese lines. These landings achieved completeinitial surprise, but since then one or two encounters have taken place with theJapanese. One of these was in the vicinity of the railway running north fromKatha, where our troops blew a gap of 120 feet in a bridge. In the action which followed, casualties were inflicted on the enemy amounting to 130 killed and 300wounded.   Our losses were 22 killed and 60 wounded.Hukawng Valley.34.   The advance of Chinese and U.S. troops continues.Pacific Theatre.New Guinea.35. An Australian patrol has made its way from the Eamu Valley to thecoast east of Bogadjim, where it has made contact with u.s.. patrols advancingalong the coast.Japanese forces are, however, still holding the road leading south fromBogadj im to the Eamu Valley.New Britain.36. Patrols, moving by boat along the south coast, have found Gasmata andLindenhafen (about 15 miles east of Gasmata) abandoned by the Japanese.Admiralty Islands.37. About the 16th U.S. forces from Los Negros landed on Manus, the mainisland of the Admiralty group, and by the 18th had captured Lorengau airfield and town.St. Matthias Group.38. On the 20th a substantial U.S. force landed unopposed on EmirauIsland, about 70 miles north-west of Kavieng.Bougainville.39. There has been some further fighting round the Torokina perimeter.All Japanese attacks have been beaten off, and none are at present in progress.The Japanese appear to be regrouping in preparation for further attacks. .AIR SITUATION.General Review.40.   Bomber Command aircraft made two heavy attacks on Frankfurt, andU.S. heavy bombers operated against targets in Germany, including Berlin.On two nights a total of about 180 enemy aircraft attacked this country.The Mediterranean Allied Air Force flew 12,236 sorties, which is a record.In Burma, transport aircraft supported our land forces.United Kingdom.41. The first attack since November 1943 in which London was not the main objective occurred on the night of the 19th/20th. About 90 enemy aircraft cameoverland and the target was announced by the enemy as Hull, but in fact allbombs fell south of the Humber with a slight concentration in the Grimsby area.On the night 21st/22nd, 95 enemy aircraft were estimated to have been over thiscountry, the majority of which attacked London. On two other nights harassingattacks were carried out by a total of 35 enemy aircraft, operating over south-east england. A total of 19 enemy aircraft were shot down including one byA.A. guns..Home Waters.42. A 6,000-ton ship near Morlaix and a tanker off Bordeaux were probably damaged by Typhoons and Mosquitoes respectively. Spitfires damaged a1,500-ton ship leaving Zeebrugge.Aircraft of&apos; Bomber Command, of which 284 were despatched, laid 780 sea-mines; two Halifax crashed in the sea.
Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.43. Heavy bombers of the U.S. with Air Force operated against targetsm Germany on four days of the week, a total of 2,598 aircraft being despatchedTargets attacked included the following - Date.	Target.

Not observed (through cloud).From the above operations, in which 3,510 fighters co-operated, 44 Fortresses,40 Liberators and 43 fighters are missing; no claims of enemy casualties by the bombers have been received, but the fighters destroyed 119 enemy aircraft,probably destroyed 12 and damaged 13.Military objectives in Northern France were attacked by 703 aircraft,including 229 heavy bombers, and these dropped 1,236 tons of bombs; one heavy,six medium and one fighter-bomber were lost on these operations. The 406 fighterson escort duty met no opposition and suffered no losses.A total of 194 Marauders dropped 265 tons of bombs in two attacks on therailway centre at Creil (north of Paris). Results were reported as fair togood and photographs show the main line cut, fires in the marshalling yards and damage to engine sheds and sidings. A damaging low level raid by12 escorted Mosquitoes was made on an electrical and engineering works atHengelo in Holland.Seven airfields in France and Holland were attacked by a total of238 Thunderbolts (two missing), and two Mosquitoes effectively bombed thehangars at Gael airfield.Fighter sweeps were, in the main, uneventful, but three were productiveof successful results. In the Paris area, 14 Tyhoons destroyed six enemy air-craft, two Mosquitoes destroyed seven near Strasbourg, and 51 Mustangs,operating near Bordeaux, destroyed 21; Allied losses were nine aircraft.Night.44. Bomber Command operated in strength on two nights of the week,the 18tli/T9th and 22nd/23rd, the main target on eaclh occasion being Frankfurt,upon which a total of 6,198 tons was dropped by 1,481 aicraf t. &apos; No photographicevidence of results is available from either of the two attacks, which were approximately equal in size, but the second would appear to have been the more successful, crews reporting a very good concentration of fires; four particularlyimpressive explosions were noted. From the 1,662 aircraft despatched,55 bombers, or 3-3 per cent., are missing and a further two crashed in thiscountry.Attacks on a smaller scale were made, without loss, on the marshalling yards at Amiens/Longueau upon which 542 tons were dropped, and on theClermont-Ferrand rubber tyre factory and two explosive works at Bergeracand Angouleme by small forces of Lancasters. Results of these raids are referred to in Appendix VII. -A total of 157 Mosquitoes attacked a number of targets in Germany and afurther 182 Mosquitoes operated on intruder patrols; the latter, from which one is missing, bombed 23 airfields and destroyed seven enemy aircraft.
Italy.45. The Mediterranean Allied Air Force flew a total of 12,236 sorties;82 Allied aircraft are missing and 111 enemy aircraft were destroyed.A heavy scale of attack by fighter bombers was maintained in support of theCassino operation, and gun positions, troop concentrations, supply dumps andother military objectives were attacked with .good results. Supplies also were dropped for our troops holding some isolated positions. Light and medium bombers concentrated their effort in the Cassino area during the early part of theweek but subsequently attacked enemy communications. Strong fighter patrols were maintained over the battle area and 21 enemy aircraft were shot down for the loss of seven Allied fighters.Successful attacks were carried out against railway centres. Very goodconcentrations were achieved at Foligno, Orvieto and Orte and bridges were alsohit; Fortresses and Liberators bombed Verona and Bologna. Over 70 Maraudersattacked bridges and viaducts at Arezzo, Bucine and Cecina with good.results.Fighter-bombers bombed railways, bridges and dumps and were active inattacking road and rail movement; three locomotives, two trains and 50 M.T.vehicles were destroyed and at least 67 other M.T. vehicles were damaged.A series of attacks were made on coastal towns and harbours. Leghornharbour was bombed by 35 Mitchells and fires were started in the dock area, inaddition to which hits were obtained on one ship and eight small vessels, some ofwhich were destroyed. Thirty-eight bombers made a night attack on thesubmarine base of Monfalcone (20 miles N.W. of Trieste); the main weight of bombs fell on and around the shipbuilding yards, heavy damage was inflicted onthe Cant aircraft works, and a ship of 450 feet was holed below the water line.Two raids by medium bombers were carried out on the harbour installations atPorto San Stefano where the railway and warehouses were hit; fighter-bombers attacked Viareggio (13 miles W.N.W. of Lucca), Sestre Levante (24 miles N.W.of Spezia), Civitavecchia, Giulianova (24 miles N.N.W. of Pescara), Ardenza(2 miles S. of Leghorn) and Follonica (21 miles N.N.W. Grosseto); shipyards and buildings were hit, a tanker was left sinking, four ships were damaged, one ofwhich was on fire, and at least nine smaller craft were destroyed or damaged.On the 18th counter air force operations were carried out in the Udine area by over 400 heavy bombers and 140 fighters. The airfields attacked were Villaorba,Maniago, Udine, Lavariano and Gorizia. Prior to the bombing the area wasswept by Thunderbolts and Lightnings, which destroyed 16 enemy aircraft in combat and 16 others on the ground; the bombers dropped 474 tons of 20-lb.fragmentation bombs and destroyed a number of aircraft on the ground, and shot down 32 in combat; seven Fortresses and four Allied fighters are missing.Enemy activity was on a comparatively small scale but fighter bombers wereactive in the Cassino and Anzio areas. An attack was made at night on theNaples/Capodichino airfield and on the port; one Airacobra was destroyed,17 others were damaged and some damage was caused to shipping.Yugoslavia.46. Thirty-seven Liberators attacked the railway centre at Knin with good results; a heavy concentration of craters was observed,on and around the station,buildings were seriously damaged, and the landing ground was rendered unser-yiceable. An attack by 33 Liberators was made on the docks and railway yards at Metkovic.Offensive reconnaissances were carried out by fighter-bombers whichdestroyed or damaged four locomotives and 26 M.T. vehicles. Three hits weremade on railway bridges north of Spoleto.Over 180 sorties were flown by fighter-bombers against coastal shipping; five,Siebel Ferries, four schooners and one barge were sunk and a large number ofsmall craft were damaged.Bulgaria.47. Oh the night 15th/16th, 53 Wellingtons and 14 Halifaxes andLiberators attacked the railway centre at Sofia. Five aircraft illuminated the target, and many hits were observed and fires started in the centre of the town;eight bombers are missing.An attack by a similar force was carried out on Plovdiv but results were notobserved.
Austria.48. Over 370 Liberators and Fortresses were despatched to attack Vienna;the target was obscured by cloud and only 192 bombers attacked the objective,although it was not possible to observe results. A total of 141 heavy bombers attacked the airfield, factory, railway yards and town of Klagenfurt, dropping522 tons of bombs. Graz was bombed by 76 Liberators, which claim hits in thefactory area, but cloud prevented the observation of results.In the course of these operations 35 enemy aircraft were destroyed and 22Allied bombers and two fighters are missing.Mgesm.49. Successful attacks were made against enemy shipping, in the courseof which one escorted ship of 1,000 tons was hit, and 11 caiques, one siebel ferryand one F-boat were sunk or seriously damaged.Russia.50. On all days, except 20th, low cloud has been the least unfavourableflying condition reported, and on many days fog and snow have been general inthe south. An improvement occurred on the 20th which allowed for greater air activity, but such improvements have occurred in the past, and have invariablyproved to be short-lived. Nothing is yet known of the extent to which the russian air Force have given support to these major offensives in the south, as the russians have made no announcements on the subject.At the beginning of the week, the G.A.F. seems to have divided its effortfairly equally between support of the German defence in the Vinnitsa-Proskurovsector, attempts to hold up the Russian advance south from TJman by attacks onthe Bug crossings in the Gaivoron area, and operations against the Soviet forcesadvancing on Nikolaiev across the Rivers Ingul and Inguletz.Burma.&apos;51. Between the 15th and 21st over 2,388 offensive sorties were flown. a variety of military objectives in all areas were attacked; these included stores and ammunition dumps, oil storage tanks, troop concentrations, enemy positions,villages, concentrations of mules, bivouac areas and gun positions. A bridge atLamu (107 miles S.E. of Akyab) was bombed by Lightnings and two-thirds of the structure was destroyed; three other bridges were damaged near Mandalay.Widespread and effective attacks were made on enemy communications inthe course of which 373 rivercraft, 73 M.T. vehicles, 22 locomotives, 51 units of rolling stock and 35 bullock carts were destroyed or damaged.A total of 574 transport aircraft operated in different areas of Burma and china. A total of 1,455 tons of stores was delivered, troops were landed and939 casualties were evacuated.China and Indo-China.52.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from recent Raid Assessment Reports.Germany.Schweinfurt. Photographs show that as a result of the . U.S.A.A.F.attack on the 24th February and&quot; the R.A.F. attack on the night of the24th-25th February, all the five works (comprising Kugelfischer Werke, V.K.F.Werke I and II, Fichtel &amp; Sachs A.G. and Deutsche Star Kugelhalter) concernedin the Schweinfurt ball bearing industry have again been severely damaged;VKF. I in particular has been very heavily affected. In many cases buildings which had been repaired since being damaged in previous raids have now been destroyed or again damaged. Many buildings in the town have been destroyed,the largest concentration of damage occurring in the vicinity of V.K.F. Werke I.At Oberndorf, near V.K.F. Werke II, 19 out of 22 huts in a labour camphave been destroyed, and severe damage has been caused to business and residential property.The villages of Garstadt and Grefenrheinfeld, respectively five miles south-west and 2^ miles south of Schweinfurt&apos;have suffered very heavy damage.France.Amiens / Longueau. Photographs show that as a result of the attack on the15th-16th March extensive and severe damage was caused throughout the marshalling yards. Two railway workshops in the north-eastern area have been destroyed or very severely damaged, a storage building has been damaged, andthere are many hits on lines and rolling stock. In the southern area two engineroundhouses have been largely destroyed, and a locomotive shed and some small buildings have been severely damaged. In this area also many tracks have been hit, and rolling stock has been damaged or derailed.Photographs taken after the attack on the 16th/17th March show that themain railway workshop in the N.E. yard has now been completely destroyed, whilethe second workshop building to the west has received two further hits and onlyone-third of the single storey portion now remains. The large circular engineroundhouse has suffered further damage and the nearby coaling tower hascollapsed.In the N.E. yard many tracks have been hit and a number of wagons damaged and derailed, and at the western approach to the through sidings more trackshave been cut. In the coaling sidings, and in the marshalling and sorting siding-further damage has been caused to tracks and to wagons. These yards were also attacked on the previous night.Clermont-Ferrand.

An immediate interpretation of photographs taken after the attack on the 18th/19th March shows that while damage was distributed over thewhole explosives works it is most severe in the eastern half of the factory.Buildings worst affected are nitration houses, powder works and storage, and the
acid recovery plant, and each of these sections contains one or more buildingsdestroyed and many others heavily damaged. In addition, many unidentified buildings at the east end of the works have been demolished or gutted. Thewashing and boiling house, pulping and drying houses and the maintenanceworkshop are among others which have suffered less severely.La Ricamarie.
