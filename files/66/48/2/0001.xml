SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS OF BOMBER COMMAND FOR FORT-NIGHT ENDING 27th FEBRUARY, 1944.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.ONE very heavy attack was made on Berlin; Leipzig, Stuttgart, Schweinfurtand Augsburg were also raided in force.Summary of Operations. aircraft target.

Clearerphotographs obtained later show that not only was considerable damage done in-the centre of the city, but a heavy weight of bombs also fell on important targets in the industrial suburbs.The Bosch electrical works, which was particularly badly hit, is one of themost important in Germany and the damage caused to it is a most valuable eon-tribution to the U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the German aircraft industry. The mainfoundries and the new sparking-plug factory were both largely destroyed by fire,and workshops, machine shops and stores were also severely damaged.It can also be seen that the Daimler-Benz factory at Unterturkheim, whichproduces aero-engines and armaments, has suffered considerably and that the ball-bearing factory at Bad Caimstadt (subsequently attacked again by U.S.A.A.F.)has been damaged.Prints Nos. 1, 2 and 3 show some of the damage caused.Schweinfurt (24th/25th February).Schweinfurt is one of the smaller objectives which Bomber Command hasattacked. Its unique importance as the centre of the German ball-bearingindustry, coupled, with the fact that the Eighth U.S.AA.F. had successfully attacked it on the day of the 24th, provided the opportunity for a heavy attack by Bomber Command on the night of the 24th/25th. Only partial cover from day photographs has been secured so far, of such poor quality that detailed inter-pretation is impossible. It would appear, however, that at least one of the majorball-bearing plants has suffered severe damage.Augsburg (25th/26th February).A very heavy attack was delivered in excellent weather conditions. Augsburgwhich is now of great importance as supporting a considerable twin-enginefighter production, was last attacked, by Bomber Command in daylight in 1942,when the M.A.N. factory making Submarine Diesel engines was the target.Although day photographs have not yet been-obtained, the night plot shows sucli an accurate and overwhelming concentration of bombs on the built-up area that itwill be surprising if any considerable part of it :has survived the attack.[270701
Results of Previous Raids.Berlin.Photographs covering 9 major attacks between 23rd/24th December, 1943,and 15th/16th February, 1944, were obtained on the 20th February. They show considerable fresh damage in almost every district of the city, though there areno new major areas of devastation and the total damage is not on the same scaleas in the previous 6 attacks between the 18th/19th November, 1943, and the16th/17th December, 1943, when some 3,000 acres were devastated, chiefly inthe central area surrounding the. Tiergarten.Many industrial plants of the highest priority have received fresh damage.Hardest hit are the Daimler-Benz works, producing tanks, tractors and aero-engines; the important firm of Lorenz, manufacturing blind-flying apparatus andmilitary wireless equipment; and the two principal A.E.G. factories, one thelargest German cable works and the other a leading producer of steam turbinesand Diesel engines. The great Siemens electrical combine has suffered further damage, severe in the case of the factory making aircraft instruments, less severeat the works which is the biggest German producer of electrodes and carbons forsearchlights. Other damaged factories include a Focke-Wulf works makingaircraft parts, the armaments factories of ambitious-Budd and Bussing, two RailwayRepair Workshops, an engine round-house and an underground railway workshop.In addition, two Gasworks and a Power Station have been hit. Industrialdamage is particularly heavy along the canal in the Tempelhof district, where themain buildings of the Airfield have also been hit. In addition to these namedfactories scores of smaller plants engaged on Avar-work of every kind have receiveddirect damage, while every one of the thousands .of industrial undertakings inBerlin must have had their output seriously reduced by absenteeism, the stoppage of supplies from damaged factories, or by the breakdown of communications, of gas, water and electricity supplies, and of general administration, which is knownto have &quot;occurred.   Prints Nos. 4 and 5 show some of the damage.Berlin (excluding outlying suburbs) has a built-up area of about 31 square miles. Of this area the whole series of attacks delivered since mid-November hasdestroyed about 7 square miles or nearly one-quarter of the whole. In addition,a great many buildings in all parts of the city have received damage of a more orless serious nature.Magdeburg.Day photographs show that considerable damage was done, especially in thesouth of the city, by the attack on the 21st/22nd January. Among the industrial concerns affected were important railway engineering workshops and the Kruppheavy engineering works. A large hutted camp at Rothensee was more than half destroyed.Mining.The minelaying offensive has been continued on a heavy and extensive scale.Routine minelaying has taken place off the French west coast ports, english channel ports and the Frisian isles. In the Kattegat and Western Baltic highaltitude minelaying is now in progress, the main weight being directed to thefocal point of enemy sea communications, Kiel Bay. This has been planned to dislocate the training and practice of U-boats during the pre-&quot; Overlord &quot;period and to interfere with their access to the Atlantic. Another important effect will be the interference caused to enemy sea communications to the russian and Norwegian Fronts.Since the beginning of the concentrated high altitude mining effort in KielBay there is no doubt that a number of ships have been damaged. Among them is known to have been the German liner Hanau of 6,500 tons (see Print No. 6).^General.It is not irrelevant to a summary of bombing and mining results to note that the total number of U-boats building and fitting out is now estimated at183 as compared with 271 when the last estimate was made in October. Theremay be up to 12 boats, which are not included in this total, building on thecovered slips at Kiel. Main reductions have taken place at Hamburg wherethere is a reduction of 34, Danzig 15 and Wilhelmshafen 5. Bremen, Bremer-hafen and lubeck  are each down by 4 boats.A. H. M.
