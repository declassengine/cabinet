NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. Carrier-borne aircraft have inflicted damage on the Tirpitz 1 in .Altenfiord. ...A large convoy has arrived in North Russian ports without loss.   At least two U-boats were sunk by the convoy escorts.Aircraft from the U.S. Pacific Fleet have attacked Palau.Northern Waters.2. On the 3rd, while a large convoy escorted and covered by ships of theHome Fleet was proceeding to North Russia, naval Barracuda aircraft, with fighter support, were flown off from H.M. ships to attack the Tirpitz in Altenfiord.The Tirpitz, when attacked, was about to leave her moorings. Bombs of 1,600 lbs.,600 lbs. and 500 lbs. were dropped and photographs indicate that 16 certainhits were obtained. Explosions occurred by the mainmast and on the forecastleand two fires were seen burning amidships. There was no opposition in the air.Three Barracudas and one fighter were lost.The convoy, consisting of 49 ships, later arrived intact in North Russian ports in spite of attacks by a concentration of about 20 U-boats over a period of several days. At least two of the U-boats are believed to have been sunk. Six enemy aircraft were also destroyed by the air and surface escorts of the convoy.3. H.M. S/M Taku, while on patrol on the 24th north of Trondheim,attacked an escorted tanker of 10,000 tons and subsequently heard a heavyexplosion. H.M. S/M Terrapin on the same day S.E. of Stavanger attacked a convoy and torpedoed a ship, thought to be the German catapult shipSchwabenland (8,631 tons). Photographs on the 1st show this ship with a largehole in her side and with an aircraft tender alongside.H.M. S/M Syrtis is overdue from patrol off the Norwegian coast and mustbe considered lost.Home Waters.4.   Coastal forces attacked a convoy off the Dutch coast on the night of the30th/31st.  One M.T.B. was damaged and subsequently sank.Mediterranean.5. At Anzio, nearly 36,000 tons of supplies were unloaded during the weekending the 4th in spite of a heavy swell which reduced the discharge on the 31stto 1,919 tons. Air raids were not heavy, but shelling increased in intensitytowards the end of the week and caused some casualties.6. HM. S/M Uproar shelled and damaged a 5,000-ton tanker in Onegliaharbour (S.W. of Genoa) on the 29th.7. In the Adriatic on the night of the 2nd/3rd, coastal forces, in two actionsoff the Dalmatian coast, captured a schooner and damaged a patrol boat by gunfire.8.   In the iEgean MLs. captured two casques.Black Sea.9.   On the 30th, a ship of 5,000 tons was sunk by Russian warships.East Indies.10. On the 3rd, two Japanese forces, one composed of two cruisers of the tone class with two destroyers and the other of a large aircraft-carrier with&apos;two destroyers, were sighted off Great Natuna Island (South China Sea) headingtowards Singapore.The Norwegian whaler Maaloy (minesweeper) was sunk with all hands bya U-boat on the 27th S.W. of Colombo.
Pacific.Carolines. ...      ,    . ... ...11. On the 29th, an enemy convoy of 14 ships sailed from Palau (WestCarolines) on a N.W. course. Later the same day a battleship, which is reportedto have been of the kong class, with a light cruiser and two destroyers alsosailed to the N.W. On the following day, the US. Pacific Fleet carried: out a strong air attack on the Japanese base at Palau. The enemy made no attemptto interfere.Five U.S. destroyers bombarded Kapingamarangi Island (GreenwichIsland, between Truk and the Solomons) on the 28th.New Guinea.12. Two Allied M.T.Bs., on the night of the 2nd/3rd, sank three bargeswhich were sailing south to Madang and damaged a fourth. They also shelledMadang and silenced gun positions. Both M.T.Bs. sustained slight damage. Onthe same night M.T.Bs. sank one barge and captured another in the Gulf ofPapua.Admiralty Islands.13. On the 30th, Allied forces landed on Pityilu Island after a preliminarybombardment by destroyers and M.T.Bs. On the following day, after similarbombardments, Allied forces occupied Ndrilo and Koruniat Islands without opposition.Solomons.14. On the night of the 29th/30th, and again on the 3rd, U.S. destroyersshelled enemy positions in Empress Augusta Bay, Bougainville. On the 2nd,U.S. destroyers shelled a barge base, S.W. of Bougainville.Anti-Submarine Operations.15. Fifteen attacks have been reported : eight by ships, six by shore-based aircraft and one by carrier-borne aircraft. Two of these attacks were carriedout in the Mediterranean.   Two U-boats have been sunk and one probably sunk.During the passage of the convoy to North Russia, H.M.S. Starling (sloop)sank a U-boat on the 29th and H.M.S. Keppel (destroyer) probably sank anotheron the night of the lst/2nd. Full reports of other promising attacks have not yetbeen received.H.M. destroyers Laforey, Tumult, Blencathra and Hambledon sank a U-boatN.E. of Palermo on the 30th in conjunction with the U.S. destroyers Kearneyand Ericsson.   .During March, 19 U-boats, were sunk, or probably sunk, two possibly sunk and three possibly damaged.Enemy Intelligence.16.   The Scheer was reported to be exercising in the Baltic on the 26th.U-boats. : . : ,17. It is estimated that there are fewer U-boats at sea in the NW.Approaches and that they are more widely dispersed. There is increased activitysouth of Nova Scotia, and it is suspected that patrols are being maintained in the approaches to-New York.In the Indian Ocean there are believed to be three Japanese and two german-boats at sea.Enemy Attack on Shipping.18. A Turkish ship was sunk by a U-boat in Turkish territorial watersnorth of Rhodes.  One ship, bound from New York, was sunk off Capetown either by torpedo or mine.An eastbound Mediterranean convoy was attacked by aircraft off Algiersand a U.S. ship was set on fire but was towed to port.Provisional figures for shipping losses by enemy action during March are20 ships, amounting to 131,000 tons.-[27222] b
Protection of Seaborne Trade.19. During the week ending the 2nd, 948 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these 241 were in ocean convoys and 707 in British coastal convoys. Four escort carriers, one anti-aircraft ship, 60 destroyers (including25 U.S. destroyers) and 99 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes were employedon escort duties.Four homeward-bound convoys, consisting of 136 ships, and four outwardconvoys, consisting of 105 ships, arrived at their destinations.  No ships were lost.Allied Minelaying.20. Aircraft have laid mines in the Baltic, off the Frisian Islands, the dutch coast and the north coast of France.In the Mediterranean aircraft laid mines in the Dodecanese.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.21.   There have again been no reports of minelaying by either aircraft orE-boats, although on two nights E-boats were operating off the South Coast.The mine totals are 4,724 ground and 4,369 moored.Off Anzio, minelaying by aircraft was suspected on three nights and eightmines have been destroyed during the week. One mine has been destroyed offCasablanca.Enemy Merchant Shipping.22. The present estimated tonnage of the Finnish merchant fleet is approxi-mately 310,000 tons, by far the greater part of which is at the disposal of theGermans.Losses during 1943 have reduced the enemy&apos;s available shipping in the black sea to about 56,000 tons, and there is every indication that the position, both inthe Black Sea and the ^aegean, is strained. Siebel ferries are being sent by railto Salonika for assembly and all Greek caiques have been ordered to collect at thePiraeus.There have been four arrivals at Bilbao of the larger ships engaged in the ore trade and six sailings.Russian Intelligence.23. It is reported that only small ships are now arriving at Sevastopol.All jetties at Odessa are reported to be prepared for thorough demolition andit was stated on the 30th that evacuation had started.Certain Finnish ports in the Gulf of Bothnia have been opened by ice-breakers, assisted in the southern part by mild weather.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern and Central Sectors.24. In the north, the Germans claim : to have encircled several Russiandivisions S.W. of Narva. While this is probably much exaggerated, it is quite possible that some Russian forces in that area have been cut off, at leasttemporarily.Between Pskov and Kowel snowfalls have restricted movement almostentirely to the roads, and from most of this area no activity has been reported.The Germans have, however, claimed &quot; defensive successessouth of Pskov and east of Mogilev. No reference has been made by the Russians to fighting at these points, and the Germans may well be giving undue importance to local activity in order to counter-balance the unsatisfactory news from Southern Russia.Kowel-T arnopol Sector.25. S.W. of Luck, the Russians have made a further advance on a thirty-milefront astride the railway to Lwow.
At Tarnopol the German garrison is still holding out, but the town has nowbeen surrounded, and the Russians have already penetrated to the centre. Ingeneral German resistance in the Luck-Tarnopol area has been very strong.Tarnopol-Jassy Sector.26. The Russian thrust from the area Tarnopol-Proskurov has been furtherwidened. The Russians are now within a few miles of Stanislavov, and have continued to make progress southwards across the Pruth, where they have captured Cernauti and established a large bridgehead.The situation in the Kamenets-Podolsk bulge is confused. A large numberof German troops were at one time encircled there but the Germans have beenfighting hard to keep open the neck of the bulge and it seems likely that manywere able to get away, possibly without their heavy equipment. The Russiansreport, however, that a considerable German force in the area N.W. of Kamenets-Podolsk is encircled, and is trying to fight its way out.Further south the Russians have crossed the Pruth and cut the railwayrunning N.W. from Jassy.As a result of the recent fighting the Russians have now reached the foothillsof the Carpathians S.E. of Stanislavov, where a pass carries the railway across the mountains to Ruthenia, an area where the Russians may well find support fromthe local inhabitants. The Russians have cut the last direct railway from Lwowto Eastern Roumania, with the result that German and Satellite forces-in south russia now have to depend very much on railways through Hungary and roumania. The Russians have now crossed the 1941 frontier of Roumania, andfor the first time have carried the war beyond what they claim to be Russianterritory.Jassy-Odessa Sector.27. The Russians have pushed southwards between the Pruth and theDniester and have cut the railway Jassy-Tiraspol, leaving only one railway andthe ferry at the mouth of the Dniester as escape routes for the German forcesstill east of the river. These forces are withdrawing rapidly from the whole area of the Lower Bug, closely pursued by the Rusisans. It now seems likely thatthey will be able to effect a withdrawal from their dangerous salient, where at onetime it seemed possible that they might be cut off.General.28. This has been another successful week for the Russians, who have successfully continued their offensive in the south.It is interesting to note that in spite of their withdrawal from the LowerBug, as a result of which Odessa must already have lost its value as a port, theGermans still show no signs of evacuating the Crimea.Italy.29. The increased activity in the Adriatic sector has been maintained.Patrolling and raiding on both sides, particularly in the areas of Orsogna andArielli have continued. The Italian Motorised Group has pushed on toMonte Mare and Monte Maronne, two features to the north of the lateral roadAtina-Isernia, and has since repelled enemy patrols. The position at Cassino-remains unchanged. The enemy has unsuccessfully mounted several small attacks against the town and the railway station, and in the town itself there have beensniping and patrolling activity. ,,Our troops to the north of Cassino have been trying to explore the tunnel system, but have had to stop owing to debris.In the brideghead the enemy has again been active. At least six more attacks have been carried out since the 29th March against British-held positions west of the Anzio-Rome road, but they have all been repulsed. Shelling of the port of Anzio continues, but enemy air activity has been confined mainly tomine-laying.Yugoslavia.30.   The Partisans have succeeded in maintaining the initiative in fighting,which has increased in intensity throughout Yugoslavia.[27222] * b 2
Fighting has continued in Montenegro in the area of Niksic and Danilovgrad(50 miles east of Dubrovnik); the Germans have brought in reinforcements fromPodgorica (60 miles S.E. of Dubrovnik) to counter the increased control whichthe Partisans are gaining over communications in this area.In Serbia Partisan forces have been engaged in stiff fighting against a mixedforce of Germans, Bulgarians and Cetniks near Usce and Raska (60 miles west of Nis) on the main railway Kraljevo-Skoplje.In East Bosnia the Partisan counter-attack has met with further success, inthe capture of the villages of Janja and Celic (70 miles S.E. of Belgrade). enemy losses in this area since the 14th March are estimated at 1,200 killed.A large-scale attack was carried out on the night 27th/28th March upon a94-mile stretch of the main Zagreb-Belgrade railway. As a result all traffic was stopped on one part of the line, and a 36-hour interruption caused elsewhere.Burma.A arakan.31. In the area near the Maungdaw-Buthidaung road, our troops have captured the Western tunnel. Further to the N.E., West African troops haveretaken the village of Kaladan.Chin Hills and Chindwin.32. Our troops have evacuated Tamu, and have also withdrawn somedistance up the Tiddim-Imphal road. Japanese pressure in the area 20 to 30miles north of Imphal continues. The Japanese are also reported astride the roadImphal-Kohima, fifteen miles south of Kohima.Upper Burma.33. Long-Range Penetration Groups operating behind the Japanese line shave continued to disrupt enemy communications. Twenty-five miles S.E. ofBhamo a bridge and a stretch of roadway have been destroyed.Hukawng Valley.34. Chinese and U.S. troops have captured Shaduzup, and are now closingin on Laban, six miles further south.Pacific.A dmiralty Islands.35. On Lorengau, U.S. forces have made a slight advance. A number ofsmall islands off the north coast of Manus have been occupied, and on Los Negros,mopping-up operations are still in progress.Solomon Islands.36. Japanese attacks in the Torokina perimeter have subsided and theenemy have made slight withdrawals from both the eastern and western edges ofthe perimeter.Marshall Islands.37. U.S. forces have occupied eleven Atolls South of Kwajelein, againstslight opposition.AIR SITUATION.General Review.38. Offensive operations by home-based aircraft were restricted byunfavourable weather conditions, but a heavy attack was made on Nurembergand a lighter one on Toulouse.In Italy, heavy air attacks were maintained on enemy positions, supplies and communications.U.S. heavy bombers attacked factories at Steyr, and rail centres andindustrial targets at Budapest, Sofia, Bucharest and Ploesti.In Burma, transport aircraft continued to operate on a considerable scale.In the Pacific, heavy attacks were made on enemy targets in New Guinea,New Britain and the Caroline Islands.
United Kingdom.39. In daylight, no enemy aircraft crossed our coasts. The only attackmade on this country was on the night 30th/31st, when a total of 15 enemy air-craft attacked S.E. England and coastal districts of Norfolk; three reached theGreater London Area.Home Waters.40. On the evening of the 30th, off Haugesund, a force of Beaufighters, ofwhich four carried torpedoes, attacked the Monte Rosa (13,882 tons), whichhad served as an accommodation ship for workmen employed on the Tirpitz,and three escort ships; two torpedo and several R/P hits were obtained on themain target and R/P hits on the escorts. A further attack on the Monte Rosawas made on the night of the 30th/31st by a single Beaufighter, but the result wasnot observed. One enemy fighter was shot down; two Beaufighters are missing.Photographs showed that the ship was atKristiansand (S) on the 1st April, but she had left again on the 2nd.On the night of the 1st/2nd, four torpedo Beaufighters and a Wellingtonattacked a convoy of about 30 ships, including minesweepers and armed trawlers,23 miles S.W. of Heligoland. One merchant ship was torpedoed, set on fire andprobably sunk.On the 5th, Spitfires damaged a 1,000-ton ship off TJshant.Eighty-six aircraft of Bomber Command laid 345 mines in enemy waters.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.41. On the 1st, 165 Liberators, escorted, by 232 Thunderbolts and- 297Mustangs, bombed targets in S.W. Germany; 263 tons were dropped on Pforzheim(15 miles S.E. of Karlsruhe), 61 tons on the Stuttgart area, and 105 tons on other targets. Twenty-six enemy aircraft were destroyed and 35 were damaged on theground and a further 12 were destroyed in combat. Twelve Liberators and fourfighters are missing.On the 5th, 21 Liberators, supported by Thunderbolts, dropped. 51 tons of bombs in a blind bombing attack on Military Objectives in the Pas-de-Calais.Enemy airfields were attacked on two days of the week. On the 30th,46 Thunberbolts, some of which were escorted, dropped .10 tons on airfields in holland with good results. On the 5th, a total of 510 Thunderbolts, Mustangsand Lightnings were despatched to make low level attacks on airfields in EasternFrance and North and Central Germany, but thick cloud prevented a large numberof aircraft from attacking. One hundred enemy aircraft were destroyed and127 were damaged on the ground and another was shot down for the loss of nine fighters.During patrols over France and Belgium, Allied, fighters, four of which are missing, destroyed ten enemy aircraft on the ground and two in the air.Night.42. On the night of the 30th/31st,. 795 aircraft of Bomber Command were despatched to attack Nuremberg; 702 attacked, dropping 2,473 tons. The route to the target was comparatively free from cloud, but over the target there was10/ 10 ths cloud. Most crews bombed, on the sky-marker flares, which were reported as being somewhat scattered, but the concentration improved in the later stages ofthe attack. Opposition from enemy fighters was strong, especially on the routein and over the target area. At least three enemy fighters were destroyed;95 bombers are missing.On the night of the 5th/6th, 141 aircraft out of 148 despatched, attackedaircraft repair and assembly plants and an airfield at Toulouse; 601 tons of bombs were dropped in bright moonlight and excellent visibilty. Preliminaryreports indicate that the attack was successful.   One aircraft is missing.A total of 157 Mosquitoes made small-scale attacks on targets in N.W.Germany and on Military Objectives in Northern France. A further 73 Mosqui-toes were engaged in &quot; Intruder &quot; operations. Four enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of one Mosquito. Thirty-one aircraft dropped leaflets on towns inFrance.
Italy.43. In all operational theatres covered by the M.A.A.F., Allied aircraft flew a total of 11,481 sorties for the loss of 88 aircraft; 255 enemy aircraft wer$destroyed.Fighter bombers attacked a great diversity of enemy targets, and operations were carried out over a wide area round Rome, extending to Central Italy, andin the vicinity of the battle areas; light bombers, both by day and night,materially supported these operations. Many good results were obtained and among some of the more important were the following   ten hits on a tank repairdepot at Twali; several bridges hit; a number of dumps either wholly or partly destroyed; railway tracks severely damaged; at least 17 locomotives destroyed;many hits obtained on gun and enemy positions, and m one operation 65 M.T.were destroyed. Effective attacks were carried out on port installations on theWest Coast at San Stefano, Civitavecchia and Leghorn, and on the Adriatic at san Benedetto. Fighters carried out patrols over shipping at Anzio and overthe battle area. In these operations light and fighter bombers and fighters flewa total of 3,300 sorties; 23 Allied aircraft are missing and 24 enemy aircraft were destroyed.Railway centres and bridges, principally in central Italy, were attacked bya total of over 500 medium bombers; the heaviest attacks were made in the areasaround Arezzo, Orvieto, Grosseto and Perugia (where two spans of a railway bridge were destroyed); good results generally were reported from these opera-tions. Forty-six Wellingtons and six Liberators made an effective night attackon the railway centre at Vicenza (40 miles W. of Venice). A variety of other targets were attacked by medium bombers, a further 400 sorties being flown;the most important targets attacked were the harbour installations at Leghorn,the airfield at Viterbo, and factories at Varlese (32 miles NVW. of Milan) and atPiombino (45 miles S. of Leghorn).Yugoslavia and Albania.44. The railway yards at Brod (120 miles W.N.W. of Belgrade), Bihac(95 miles W.NW of Split), Nis (122 miles SW. of Belgrade), Leskovik (55 miles.S.E. of Valona), and in the Split area at Knin and Drnis, were attacked by atotal of 266 Fortresses and Liberators; many bursts were seen in the target areas.Twenty-eight Liberators attacked the airfield at Mostar, obtaining hits onthe hangars and other buildings. Fortresses dropped 104 tons on the airfield atImotski (38 miles E. of Split), and fighter bombers obtained hits on the hangars and started several fires at Tirana airfield. Fighter bombers sunk a previouslydamaged escort vessel, effectively attacked small shipping, destroyed the spanof a bridge at Valona, and obtained hits on M.T., A.A. positions and radarstations.Vis (40 miles S.S.W. of Split) was attacked by 30 enemy aircraft; some damage and casualties were caused.Austria.45. At Steyr, a ball-bearing factory was attacked by 257 heavy bombers, andthe Daimler Puch Aircraft Factory by 156 Liberators; escort was provided byLightnings and Thunderbolts. Photographs taken after the attack show theessential buildings of the ball-bearing works to be completely destroyed, but littlefresh damage to the aircraft factory. A total of about 250 enemy fighters were encountered, and 30 heavy bombers are missing; the bombers destroyed 70 enemy aircraft and the fighters a further 30.Hungary^46. The railway centre at Budapest was bombed by 268 Liberators, and theaircraft factory at Budapest/Tokol by 122 Fortresses; a total of 912 tons of bombswas dropped. Photographs show that at the former target considerable damage has been done, including a number of hits on a chemical works and an oil refinery;at the latter target over 300 craters are shown in the precincts of the factory, but no severe damage. About 50 enemy aircraft were encountered and. 6 heavy bombers are missing; the bombers shot down 15 enemy fighters and escortingLightnings a further nine.
On the following night the Manfred Weiss Aero-Engine Plant at Budapestwas attacked by seven Liberators and 70 Wellingtons; 103 tons of bombs were dropped.Bulgaria.47. The railway centre at Sofia was attacked at night by 56 Wellingtonsand eight Liberators, and on the following day by 367 escorted heavy bombers.Photographs taken subsequently showed much damage to the main railway centre and in the commercial area, and hits on barracks and an ammunition dump. Sixbombers and one fighter were lost and 13 enemy aircraft were shot down.JEgean.48. Medium bombers attacked Maleme airfield (Crete) and targets on Lerosand Rhodes harbour. Beaufighters attacked a fuel dump on Naxos and sank orseverely damaged eight caiques.Rumania.49. The railway yards and repair facilities at Bucharest were attacked by313 escorted heavy bombers; 786 tons of bombs were dropped, well covering theentire yards. Photographs show great damage, the railway lines blocked in alldirections, many fires burning, the North Station and locomotive depot very severely damaged and many hits on the power station.Pour hundred and twenty escorted heavy bombers were despatched to attackPloesti. Bad weather was encountered and only 230 reached the target, dropping487 tons of bombs in the area of the railway yards.During both these operations a total of about 350 enemy aircraft were encountered, and 23 heavy bombers were lost. Preliminary reports indicate that about 100 enemy aircraft were destroyed.Russia.50. Only isolated reports of air activity have been received, and these, forthe most part, are connected with the advance of the Army Groups in theUkraine.In the Far North, Russian aircraft claim to have sunk two ships in the gulf of Petsamo and a tanker off Arnei Island.On the Ukrainian Fronts, heavy air support has been provided by russian aircraft in support of their land forces. In the Kovel area, the Russians areconcentrating in preventing the enemy being supplied and maintained by air transport.The Russian advance towards Tiraspol and Odessa has received considerably more attention from the German Air Force during the week than has recentlybeen paid to this sector of the front; as a result, the scale of effort north of Jassyhas been considerably reduced.Burma.51. For the week ending dawn on the 4th, Allied aircraft flew a total of2,850 offensive sorties. For the same period transport aircraft flew 834 sorties and carried a total of 2,026 tons, 4,679 men, 308 animals and 7 guns; in addition,1,455 casualties were evacuated.In the Upper Chindwin and Chin Hills, fighter-bombers carried out effectiveattacks on enemy positions, supplies and troops; the heaviest scale of effort was directed on targets in the areas around Tamu, Homalin and Imphal andfurther north in the Somra district. Other objectives attacked in these districtsincluded tanks, three of which were destroyed, and animal and motor transport.In Central Burma a number of airfields were attacked by Lightnings andMustangs; at least 20 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground, a numberof others damaged, and four enemy aircraft shot down. Good attacks weremade on enemy transport; over ,50 units of rolling-stock and a. similar number ofriver-craft were damaged. Ywataung (10 miles S.W. of Mandalay) railway station was bombed by Wellingtons, and Liberators attacked oil and powerinstallations.
In the Arakan, mostly on the Mayu and Kaladan rivers, 99 river-craft were destroyed and a further 228 damaged; enemy positions and guns were alsoeffectively attacked.In the Rangoon area, Liberators bombed dumps near Victoria Lake and made two attacks on Kemmendine railway station; Beaufighters damaged about40 units of rolling-stock, several locomotives and a schooner.
