The White Paper describes proposals for a national water policy andfor the constitution of River Boards.     The draft now submitted incorporatescertain alterations in form suggested by the Reconstruction Committee.       Thereare two points of substance to which we think it desirable to draw special attention: -(a) The proposal - described at the foot of page 8 - to substitute forthe present system, under which the powers needed by water undertakershave, in many cases, to be obtained by promoting a Private Bill,a simplified system of Ministerial Orders.     The White Paper does not suggest in detail how the new system should work because the wholequestion of Ministerial Orders is now being examined by the Machineryof Government Committee and by Parliament itself.     But the paperrecognises that certain types of Order ought to be subject to review by Parliament.(b) The proposals - referred to on pages 9 and 10 for an Inland &quot;SaterSurvey, to determine the yield and quality of water resources.The Reconstruction Committee suggested that this work should becarried out by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research,but discussions with that Department have shown that they are notspecially organised for such a purpose.       It is, therefore,proposed that responsibility for the -work should remain,  as at presentwith the Health Departments, who would, however, avail themselvesfully of all the assistance which the Geological Survey and the WaterPollution Research Board and any other branches of the D.S.I.R. arein a position to give.3* The Bill, which is briefly described on page 15 of the Paper, enablesgrants to be given towards the cost of extending rural water supplies and sewerage.        The Lord President,&apos;s Committee have recommended that it should come into operation on the date of Royal Assent (L.P (44) 14th Meeting:Conclusion 3(l))y    but in practice little work can be done under it beforethe end of the war in Europe.

s12A NATIONAL WATER POLIGYIntroductoryIn this Paper, the Government submit to Parliament and the country their proposals for shaping a national water policy. The Paper is concerned withways and means of ensuring that all reasonable needs for water can in future be met and that they can be met speedily and without avoidable waste,either of water itself or of labour, materials or money.There is in this country ample water for all needs. The problem is not one of total resources, but of organisation and distribution. It is an extremelydifficult problem, and its complexity is often not appreciated. For the house-wife to turn the tap is a simple operation; its very-simplicity belies the immense, imount of organisation, labour, expense and ingenuity which lies behind the(. .egular supply of water which she thus obtains.Sources of supply may range in scale from some small well, costing a fewhundred pounds and taking a few weeks or months to bore, to impoundingreservoirs and aqueducts bringing water from remote upland gathering grounds which may take ten years to construct, may cost five million poundsand may involve transforming two square miles of countryside into a vastlake of ten thousand million gallons. Demands are never still; as they grow,there is continual development of undertakings, exploiting of new sources,erection of new works, extensions of distribution. Water has not only to beobtained and stored and distributed, but often also to be treated and filteredand prepared for human consumption. Water undertakers supply about500,000,000,000 gallons every year. They spend about  30 millions a year in running costs alone, and about  10 millions a year on new works. yet the cost of a piped supply of water to the householder of an average smallhouse, for all the uses of the household for a week, is seldom more than thecost of a single glass of beer.Water is a peculiarly difficult commodity to bring to the consumer. Itcannot be compressed or concentrated for distribution. It is bulky, and costs of distribution are relatively high. For these reasons local sources mustbe used as fully as possible. It is essential to have a sound national pattern of supply and distribution. To achieve this means effective machinery forascertaining and appraising all the essential factors, and it means changesin law and in practice which are urgently needed. Proposals to thisend are outlined in the pages which follow. They are based for the mostpart on the reports of the Central Advisory Water Committee, a widely representative body under the Chairmanship of Field Marshal Lord Milneto whose valuable work the Government wish to pay tribute.While the problem in Scotland is broadly similar to that in England andWales, account must be taken of differences in geography, local government,structure, law and water supply organisation in the two countries. To aydidunnecessary complication of the text, therefore, the special features of theScottish water supply service and the Governments proposals as affecting that service are described in a separate section.As in the case of the recent White Paper on the National Health Service,the Governments proposals are presented with a view to discussion in Parlia-ment and with the various interests concerned before the precise form of themeasure to be submitted to Parliament is determined.33665
WATER SUPPLIESDEFECTS IN THE PRESENT SYSTEM* ;A brief account of the growth and development of public water supplies will be found in Appendix A and as regards Scotland on page /1   .A review of the present system of water services cannot overlook certainconspicuous defects of the organisation both central and local. The provisionof wholesome water as a necessity, of life and a defence against disease isplainly a&apos; concern of the Minister of Health, but his responsibility and his powers are alike somewhat vague and ill-defined. Moreover, they vary inrelation to different types of undertakers according as the undertakers operate under the general powers of the Public Health Acts or derive their powersdirectly from Parliament by a special Act. In the latter case the A&apos;&quot;authorises works, prescribes maximum charges, and generally regulates the&apos;management of the undertaking and its relations with consumers and other interests, but Parliament has itself no machinery for ensuring that the powers are properly exercised. For this it would naturally look to the Ministry ofHealth as the appropriate organ of the Executive, but apart from a fewspecial powers conferred on the Minister under the special Acts (e.g. authorising-ing additional borrowing or revising charges), the Minister has no adequatepower to discharge these duties of supervision. As regards undertakingsoperating&apos; under the Public Health Acts a numerous class consisting mostlyof small units all of whom are local authorities or combinations of authorities the powers of the Minister are more- extensive, e.g. he can sanctionborrowings and authorise the compulsory acquisition of land on which to-sink a well, and his consent is required to the use of a new source. Hehas, however, even in these cases no power to authorise the taking of watercompulsorily from a river or stream. In the case of local authorities operat-ing as water undertakers under the Public Health Acts there is the ultimatesanction, which applies generally to all services under those Acts, that ifthe local authority is in default its functions may be transferred to anotherauthority. There is no similar sanction in the case of companies operating under special Acts.As regards local organisation, there is a general obligation under the PublicHealth Acts on local authorities, i.e. Councils of county boroughs, boroughs,urban and rural districts, to review from time to time the wholesomenessand sufficiency of the water supplies in their area, the object being to seethat by one means or another every house has a sufficient supply of whole-some water within a reasonable distance. Their obligation does not require them to make sure that the water mains are taken to such points as willenable a piped supply to be carried into the houses. In: fact they normallydo so, but there is no obligation, and if they are not themselves water undertakers they have no adequate power to secure that it is done.Another source of weakness lies in the multiplicity of water undertakers.There are in England and &quot;Wales over a thousand of these in all operating under general or special statutory powers and varying greatly in size and resources. It is true that 26 of these (i.e. about 2% per cent, of the total)supply between them 50 per cent, of the total population, and that 123supply between them 75 per cent. None the less the existence of this largenumber of separate undertakings means that there is room for carryingmuch further, and speeding up, if necessary by compulsion, the process of amalgamation in the interests of more efficient management and wider
129spreading of costs. There have, of course, been many amalgamationsalready. One of the most notable examples is the Metropolitan Water board which was born in 1902, after many years of gestation, to take over eightseparate undertakings and is probably the largest single water undertaking in the world, supplying between one-sixth and one-fifth of the total populationof England and Wales. But&apos; the tempo is too slow. Amalgamation of undertakings is prima facie desirable in the public interest where units are so small that they cannot afford sufficient skilled supervision, or where their continued separate existence involves waste of resources or excessive cost.Moreover serious failure of supply in times of difficulty usually arises in small undertakings which lack the financial resources to secure themselves against the risk of drought. On the other hand amalgamation can be over-done, in the sense that there comes a point at which further increase in sizeco far from improving efficiency may increase the costs of administration.[ -Tiong the advantages of amalgamation is the possibility not only of spread-ing costs but also of securing greater flexibility in the use of sources, e.g.avoiding over-pumping of wells by drawing for a time on other wells or onoverground supplies. This can of course be secured by bringing the sourcesinto one ownership, under a bulk supply board or otherwise, and does notnecessarily entail disturbance of distribution systems which are in themselvesefficient.Again, much more detailed information is still required about the behaviourover a long period of both surface and underground sources and the usewhich is made of them. Individual schemes for supply, allocation of resources between competing interests, grouping of areas, prevention of waste,all require to rest firmly on the best possible factual basis.There is great need also for continuous survey over a period of years odthe gross needs of water, more particularly for big industrial centres, andfor means of checking the development of a policy of grab, or &quot; first comefirst served,&quot; in the pursuit of new sources. Much has been done in thisdirection during the past 20 years through the agency of Regional AdvisoryWater Committees, consisting of voluntary organisations of water undertakersand county councils set up for large areas at the instigation of the Ministryof Health. It is proposed to build upon this work and to strengthen theposition and vary the constitution of these Committees and probably to add to their number.There is need in the public interest for special measures to prevent misuseand waste of underground sources of supply, e.g. in the Bunter sandstone andLincolnshire limestone areas, so as to conserve water not only for domesticwater supply but also in the interests of industrial and other users.The question of the supply of water by public water undertakers for indus^-trial and agricultural purposes also calls for immediate consideration. Atpresent the obligation of water undertakers to give a supply does not normallyextend to water required for non-domestic use. The giving of such a supply,even where it is abundantly clear that it can be given without even remotelyprejudicing the domestic supplies for the area, is entirely a matter for agree-ment between the parties. There is no provision for resolving a deadlockand securing the industrialist or farmer a supply on reasonable terms andconditions,The importance of adequate supplies of piped water for agricultural purposes cannot be over-estimated, if efficiency in agricultural production is tobe achieved.   In the past, production has in many areas been seriouslyhampered by lack of water.   In the future this will be even more apparent33665 a 3
)as the success of modern scientific methods of alternate husbandry, and theimprovement in the quality, as well as the quantity, of the milk supply,depends largely on adequate supplies of water on the farms. The campaign for the reduction of disease in farm animals is also materially affected by lackof water in rural areas. A large programme for the provision of pipedsupplies to farms and fields will therefore be necessary after the war in orderto promote the efficiency of agriculture.While the general quality of our public water supplies is high, the priceof immunity from disease is constant vigilance, and there is need for some further tightening up of provisions against pollution.In some cases charges should be levelled over wider areas, by the amalgama-lion of undertakings which would secure greater all-round efficiency and economy. There is also need for a uniform procedure for the revision of charges to replace the present welter of varying methods (appeal to Quar*&quot;\Sessions; private Bill; Provisional Order; Order or consent of the minister under special Act; Order under an Act of 1921 relating to increases in cost over 1914 level) by which consumers or undertakers can seek alterations.The prime object of all organisation and planning of domestic supplies should be to ensure that as many houses as possible can readily be connectedup with a public main and that the householders can obtain at all times amplewater from the main supply. In our great cities and in urbanised areasgenerally piped supplies are practically universal. This is not so in the countryside, despite the improvement in the past decade. Nearly 30 percent, of those living in rural districts are still not reached by the maitns.Thus, water supplies in the countryside are still much below the level ofadequacy which modern standards demand, and the Government considerthat large extensions of piped supplies in rural localities, and also of sewerage,must form an important part of a progressive housing and agricultural policy.Apart from specific defects there are other reasons for a thorough overhaulof the sys;em. In the first place, as standards of living rise the consumptionof water increases and, apart from waste, rightly increases by leaps andbounds. Indoor sanitation nearly doubles the consumption of water, andthe greater use of baths, the provision of constant hot water, the washing of motor-cars, all add to the demand, as does the widespread and growing useof water in many industrial processes. Moreover, urbanisation not onlyaugments demand but decreases the available supply. The great increasein the extent of ground covered by impervious materials roofs of buildings,tarred roads, asphalted open spaces and the like results in the rapid carryingoff to drn:ns and rivers of water which previously saturated the ground.For all these reasons it would be wrong to assume that a continuance of thepresent system unaltered would produce results as satisfactory even as in thepast still less meet the needs of the future.2. OBJECTS AND PRINCIPLES OF A NATIONAL WATER policy the preceding chapter indicates the chief defects in the system for whichremedies need to be found. Details of the remedies proposed are described in later sections, but as the proposals cover a number of different subjects and so form a complicated pattern, it may be helpful to state first the broadintentions underlying them and the principles on which the government believe a national water policy should be founded.The object of policy must be to make the best and most economical useof the country&apos;s water resources. These resources must be used, and watersupply schemes must be designed to fit a planned water economy.  Allocation
of resources must: be planned well ahead on the basis of informed estimates of needs. Premature development of sources must however be avoidedbecause capital cost of large schemes is heavy and if development gets too far ahead of revenue from charges for the water the consumers will have topay much more than they should. It is not always sound economy to plan in detail too far ahead. Science does not stand still; populations shift; estimates-of trade demands may be falsified by events. To-day, possibilities ofpurification are such that rivers can be used for water supplies to a muchgreater extent than was at one time thought possible. Not so many years a^o, it was thought in responsible quarters that London would have toabandon the use of the Thames and the Lee, but to-day ninety per cent,of London&apos;s water bacteriologically probably the purest in the world comes from these two rivers. If time, energy and money had been spent yearstq in working out a detailed scheme for supplying London from e.g. theke District, it would in the event have proved a costly academic exercise.Again, industrial demands have been reduced by methods allowing of there-use of process water, as in the beet sugar industry and in the retting of flax. Changes of fashion and new developments due to research have in thepast led to shrinkage of trade in particular areas, and thus removed theprospect of expected increases in population and in trade demands for water,with the result that water resources which at one time were expected to havea limited life have in fact proved more than ample. In short, a planned watereconomy means the building up of a body of information as a backgroundagainst which sensible and speedy decisions can be given as to the best wayto meet particular needs rather than an attempt to frame a master plan towhich all decisions must conform as to a Procrustean bed.Accordingly, the first object of the Governments proposals is to ensurethat there are efficient means of collecting and using comprehensive informa-tion relating to water resources and to demands for water, both present andfuture.But when all the necessary knowledge is available, it will be of no valueunless there is power to see that it is applied and an efficient machine isbuilt up to apply it. In considering how these things can best be secured theGovernment have been guided by three general principles.First, it is clear that if haphazard and wasteful development is to be prevented there must be some degree of central control; this must be sufficient for the purpose, but should not be control merely for the sake of control.Nor is it desired to see change for the sake of change. Much of the present organisation is working well the fact, that in general the water supplies ofthe country are so good is proof of this and the new structure should retain what is best of the old. Change must find its justification in improvedtechnical efficiency or in marked reduction of costs rather than in anypreconceived ideas as to the organisation which would be best adapted tomeet the needs of to-day if it were possible to start with a dean slate.Second, ultimate responsibility for the efficiency and vigour of the adrhinis-tration of the country&apos;s water supplies must rest with democratic bodies_at the centre with a Minister responsible to Parliament; at the circumferencewith local authorities responsible to their electorates. In so far as undertakingsare in the hands of water companies, the companies must in the last resort beamenable to such regulation of the conduct of their business as is necessaryin the national interest.Third, everyone is interested in water, and the building up of a watersupply system affects and may injure-many different interests.    Clearly,sectional interest must be set aside if the national interest requires it.   But33665     . A 4
.the procedure adopted must afford ample protection for all; everybody musthave the fullest opportunity of putting their case to the Minister, who willif necessary hold a public inquiry, or, where there is need for this, toParliament.The proposals set out in the remaining sections of this paper are in theGovernments belief sufficient but no more than sufficient to meet the needs and they have been designed to conform with the principles just described.3.   CENTRAL ORGANISATIONCentral Executive authority the Government propose that central responsibility to Parliament for thewater supply services in England and Wales shall rest explicitly on the Ministerof Health and in Sco tland on the Secretary of State. For this purpose it-isproposed that the Health Ministers shall be given by statute the express dtjof promoting the conservation of water resources and the provision of adequatewater supplies throughout the two countries.In addition to the general task of supervising the water supply servicesof the country, much of the planning work necessary to ensure that the best use is made of national water resources must be carried out centrally. Thepurpose in view is the building up of the fullest possible body of knowledgeof water resources and water needs a body of knowledge which will enabledevelopment proposals to be suitably designed and wisely judged.There must be sufficient central control to ensure that the knowledgeacquired is applied and that the relative needs and resources of different areas are properly determined. The Government propose that in Englandand Wales this central planning function shall be assigned to the Minister ofHealth and that it shall be his duty to consider proposals submitted to himby water undertakers in the light of the knowledge available to him and decide whether or not they accord with an economic use of water resources and are equitable in relation to other areas and interests. If the Minister is satisfied that the proposals submitted to him are acceptable, or that actionwhich he is entitled to initiate is necessary, he will be empowered to give his approval or direction by Order. Before reaching a conclusion on any major issue he will cause a local inquiry to be held. In addition, as part of theprocess of obtaining a complete picture of resources and needs, he will infuture be able to draw to a greater extent on other Departments, includingthe Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Board of Trade, the Ministryof War Transport (in relation to canals) and the Ministry of Town and country Planning. Indeed the work in progress in the sphere of town and country planning will make it essential for the Minister and all .who areresponsible for water policy to be in constant touch with planning policy.The general effect of this will be to substitute for the present system underwhich water undertakers (other than those operating under the Public HealthActs) obtain development powers by promoting a Private Bill, a simplifiedsystem of Ministerial Orders. But the Government recognise, as did theCentral Advisory Water Committee, that under such a system there will betypes of Orders as, for example, Orders dealing with such matters ascompulsory amalgamation and combination of undertakings, alteration oflimits of supply, the scheduling of areas for water conservation and the compulsory purchase of water rights, which by reason of their intrinsicimportance or because of their effect on the interests of the general public orof individuals, should be subject to review by Parliament. In connectionwith water undertakings the normal method for such a review has been in
131the past the familiar &quot; Provisional Order &quot; procedure. The question whether some modified system might be devised is a matter which is closely bound up with the procedure of Parliament and has to be considered in a contextwider than that of water legislation. For that reason it would be out of place to embody in the present Paper any detailed proposals on the subject.Central Advisory Water CommitteeTo enable the Minister to carry out the functions assigned to him, both of supervision and planning, he will need expert assistance and advice. Centralstaffs will require to be strengthened for this purpose, and the Minister shouldhave the assistance of some central body to advise him on matters of generalpolicy.Such a body already exists in the Central Advisory Water Committee.This Committee which was first appointed in 1937, is representative of aI de range of interests connected with water in all its respects and not merelywith water supply. Thus there are on the Committee representatives of localauthorities, water supply, industry, landowners, land drainage and navigation.Moreover, the Committee advises the Government generally and not merely the Minister of Health. It is a Standing Committee and it has assessors from various Government Departments including the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries, the Ministry of War Transport and the Department of scientific and Industrial Research as well as the Ministry of Health. The Committee&apos;terms of reference are:  (a) to advise the Government Departments on questions relating to the conservation and allocation of water resources;(b) to advise the Government Departments on any questions which maybe referred by them to the Committee with respect to any matter arising inconnection with the execution or any proposed amendment of the enact-ments relating to water; and(c) to consider the operation of the enactments relating to water andto make to the Government Departments such representations with respectto matters of general concern arising in connection with the execution ofthose enactments, and with respect to further measures required, as theCommittee think desirable.Much valuable work has been done by the Committtee, and a brief referenceto the reports which they have already submitted will be found inAppendix A. The Government propose that it shall now be made a StatutoryCommittee and be empowered, in accordance with its present terms of refer-ence, not merely to advise on questions referred to it by Government Depart-ments but to make to them representations on any question within its field of work on which it thinks it right to express an opinion.The Minister of Health, for his part, will refer to the Committee anyquestion of principle and substance on which it is able to advise. Forexample, the supply of water on a large scale to agriculture and industryraises many difficult problems and the Government will certainly desire tohave further advice from the Committee on the extent to which and theprinciples on which use can be made of the public water supply services tomeet agricultural and industrial needs.Inland Water SurveyThe next requisite is to build up the body of knowledge necessary tothe proper designing of development schemes and an equitable allocation ofwater resources. There is of course much knowledge already. Compre-hensive records of rainfall have long existed, .and there are no major sources
idof water the existence of which is not already known. Nevertheless, muchmore knowledge is required as to the yield and general behaviour and quality of these sources. This is a matter of scientific assessment and recording. a beginning was made with this work in the Ministry of Health and theDepartment of Health for Scotland before the war, with the assistance of astrong Advisory Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry Lyons,but, through no fault of the Committee, it was on an inadequate scale.Moreover it was interrupted by the war. The Government consider thatcollection and collation of scientific records of the flow of rivers and ofinformation regarding the quality7 of water and the behaviour of undergroundwater sources should be pressed on with vigour as soon as circumstances permit. Such records over a period of years will enable conclusions. to bedrawn on a much more reliable basis than at present as to such matters asthe yields of gathering grounds or the appropriate size of reservoirs, willprovide valuable data for use in relation to the determination of compensatifwater and will be of value not merely to water undertakers but to all those interested in the &quot;. regime &quot; of rivers and the use of both overground andunderground sources. As regards underground water, the work will continueto be done mainly through the Geological Survey of the Department of scientific and Industrial Research which has already done much valuablework in this sphere.In England and Wales much of the data required will be obtained from thenew River Boards referred to later, on whom will be placed the duty ofmaintaining and making available records of gaugings and any other requiredinformation as to the behaviour of a river. General powers will be needed to obtain statistics of various kinds from all substantial users of water,including information as to geological strata from all persons by or for whomwells or borings are sunk. The task of the Survey can be summed up as thetask of making available to Government Departments, water undertakers,industry, agriculture,- canal owners and indeed to all who need it informationas to the yield, behaviour and quality of the country&apos;s water resources.Regional Advisory Water committees the Inland Water Survey will provide one part of the indispensable basisof knowledge on which to plan allocation, conservation and distribution ofwater. But there are other considerations to be weighed before a soundallocation policy can be framed.The laying of trunk mains is very costly and for this reason it is soundpractice to meet the needs of an area from local sources so far and so longas this is practicable. In a number of areas, however, there are no nearbysources, or such sources as there are have become inadequate to the moreexacting needs of the present day, and it becomes necessary to look further and further afield. This introduces the risk of an elaborate and wastefulcriss-cross pattern, and possible conflict, between adjacent water undertakers.Water sources must therefore be allocated to the various areas &quot;on the basisof a careful estimate of the probable demand for water in each area for anumber of years ahead. To frame such an estimate is by no means an easytask, because account has to be taken of changes in population, in industry,in uses of water and consequently in the demand for water, but it is particu-larly necessary in the case of the larger water undertakers whose schemes may take as much as ten years to complete. It must be considered what areascan best be supplied as independent units and what areas should combine forone supply either in bulk or in detail, or should co-operate in other ways, e.g.by inter-connections to meet emergencies.
Experience has shown that wherever there are large aggregations of popula-tion with common water problems, there is need of a regional body which canadvise the Minister and the undertakers as to the best means of marryingdemand and available resources over a wide area and foster joint action.From the conclusions of such bodies, correlated by the Minister who can him-self, looking on the country as a whole, resolve conflicts between competingbodies, a national policy as regards allocation of resources can be built up.For this purpose there are already nine Regional Water Advisory Com-mittees on which the water undertakers in the region, the County councils and the Ministry of Health are represented, the Ministry&apos;s representative insome cases acting as Chairman. The nine Committees serve the louowmgareas:  (i) South-West Lancashire.(2) North, Central and South-East Lancashire,v    (3) T0e West Riding of Yorkshire.(4) Cheshire and North-West Derbyshire.(5) The Sherwood area (Bunter sandstone).(6) The West Midlands (Warwick, Worcestershire and Staffordshire).(7) Kent (excluding Metropolitan Water Board area).(8) East Sussex.(9) Isle of Wight.The Committees cover between them most of the more densely-populateddistricts in the country, and include 354 water undertakers serving a total population of 16,000,000. It is considered that there is a prima facie case for Committees for the Greater London area, North-East England and SouihWales.These Committees were set up at various dates over the past 20 yearsand are at varying stages in their work. Several have established alreadythat their collective resources when fully exploited will more than meet totalneeds for 25 or more years ahead, and that their problem is proper pooling of resources within their area; one has estimated that fresh supplies from outside sources will be needed in 30 years and has sources in view, others are at a less advanced stage of collection of statistics and appraisal of trends.The task with which the Regional Committees are faced is complex. Theyare handicapped by the fact thai, they rely entirely for their effectiveness onthe goodwill of the individual undertakers. The Government consider thattheir position and that of the Minister in relation to them should be.strengthened, and they propose that the Committees shall be given power .torequire water undertakers to supply them with information and statistics,and that provision shall be made for their expenses. They propose also thatthe Committees shall include representatives of local authorities as well as ofwater undertakers; and that the Minister shall be empowered to set up a regional Committee of his own motion; to settle or vary its area and com-position, to appoint a Chairman, and to secure for it all the information itneeds.In areas of more scattered population wheie Regional Commiltees arenot required, the Government consider that County Councils can often play a similar part and co-operate with District Councils and other water under-takers in reviewing the needs and resources of the area. Some of them havialready done so and have made wise use, in the interests of better planning of their power to contribute towards the cost of water supply schemes within,the County area as a lever to secure joint action.
4. LOCAL organisation the powers and duties of local authorities and the various forms of waterundertaking are described in Appendix A. The Government see no necessity to alter the general conception of the responsibilities of local authori-ties nor do they wish to interfere unnecessarily with water companies, manyof whom are giving highly efficient and economical service to the public.Nevertheless some adjustments in the present arrangements are needed. Themultiplicity of water undertakings has, for example, called for specialcomment. For the purpose of enabling the local organisation to be improved in this and other respects without undue difficulty, delay or expense, theGovernment propose that the Minister shall be given further powers for thefollowing purposes:  (i) to authorise by Order and, if necessary, to require combinationsof water undertakers.(2) to require the giving of bulk supplies by one undertaker to another.(3) (a) to authorise by Order the alteration of limits of supply of awater undertaker.(&amp;) to authorise by Order water undertakers, on the request of owners or occupiers in an area outside their limits of supply, to supplywater in that area.(4) to authorise by Order a county council to become a member ofa joint board.(5) to settle a dispute between a joint board and any constituent member on the request of either side.in addition to these powers for improving the local organisation by a simpleprocedure, the Minister must also possess adequate means of carrying out his general supervisory functions. It is part of the Governments proposals that local authorities shall retain their primary duty to consider the needs ofthe inhabitants of their areas from time to time, and to take or secure appro-priate action. But in this, as in other services, active central supervision isalso necessary. It is proposed that, so soon as the necessary technical staffcan be made available, a beginning shall be made with a continuous inspection and survey by the Ministry of Health of the need and standard of achiev-ment of the various areas, in which the whole country will be covered indue course beginning with the most difficult areas first. Some CountyCouncils have themselves undertaken the collection of information of the type required and the Ministry propose to avail themselves, fully of all help of this nature which County Councils are able and ready to give.Information obtained from this survey will be of value in helping to buildup the comprehensive picture of the country&apos;s needs and existing supplies uponwhich policy will be based, but its main purpose will be a review of actual per-formance. Where performance falls below a reasonable level the minister will need to take default action. As already stated the- Minister already hascertain default powers in the case of local authorities, but he has no such powers in the case of companies. . The Government propose, following therecommendation of the Central Advisory Water Committee, that the minister shall be given power to make an Order requiring a statutory water company to carry out any essential work which he is satisfied after inquiry they can reasonably be required to carry out, and in case of non-compliance by thecompany to make an Order transferring the undertaking to a local authority or other water undertaker if that is necessary to ensure adequate supplies.
5. GENERAL POWERSProtection of Water ResourcesWater policy must not be frustrated by the waste of water resources.At present public water undertakers are subject to control in the abstractionand use of underground water for public supplies, and injurious competitiveboring or pumping between undertakers can be checked. Moreover, protectioncna be given to the water supplies of private individuals or industries. Butprivate owners of land have unfettered rights in all water under their land which does not flow in defined channels. They may abstract unlimitedquantities for their own use or for use in their businesses or for sale to others,and they may allow any water not required by them to run to waste. If theysink shafts through water-bearing strata for obtaining coal or other minerals,they are under no obligation to line the shafts or otherwise to conserve the-upplies in the water-bearing formation, and frequently large quantities ofwater are pumped to waste or gain access to the workings and becomecontaminated.Public water -undertakers have no remedy against a neighbouring owner of land who deprives them of water under their land by competitive boring, or who pollutes their supplies by the deposit or discharge of substances whichfoul the subsoil in the vicinity of their land, unless they can prove, usuallyan impossible; task, the precise source of pollution. This disability as regardscompetitive boring applies also to industrial concerns and private owners.Rivers or canals dependent on springs may also be seriously depleted byborings in the vicinity.To remedy these defects the Government propose (i) that a power shall be given to the Minister to make Orders schedulingany area within which the conservation of water resources, surface orunderground, is necessary in the public interest whether for the protectionof public water supplies or for that of industrial or other users. before making such an Order the minister will be required to hold a public inquiry.The Order will prohibit the additional abstraction of water within the area without the consent of the Minister, except in cases specified in the Order,e.g., abstraction by a private individual for his own domestic purposes;(2) that, if a new mine is sunk in a schedule area, an obligation shallbe placed on the mining undertaking to take such measures as are agreed by the Minister and the Minister of Fuel and Power to be necessary and practicable for conserving water in the strata without interfering with thewinning of the mineral. An inquiry will be held, if requested, before any decision is reached;(3) that it shall be made an offence to allow underground water to runto waste from borings or to pollute it;(4) that power shall be given to the Minister to obtain from any -private company or person any necessary returns of the quantity and quality ofwater (other than water taken by a private individual for his own domesticuse) abstracted from underground.Supply of Water to Industry, Agriculture, etc.The Government propose that water undertakings should be placed under an obligation to supply water for industrial, agricultural and other purposes onreasonable terms and conditions, provided this can be done without endanger-ing the normal domestic supply any questions as to the reasonableness of terms and conditions or of a refusal to supply to be determined by the Minister. Atpresent the giving of such&apos;supplies.is usually, a.matter of bargaining betweenthe parties and there is ho &quot;provision for arbitration.
Acquisition of Land and Water rights in England and Wales, subject to the exception mentioned below, thepower to take water compulsorily from any source can be conferred only byAct of Parliament. Under the Water Supplies (Exceptional Shortage Orders)Act, 1934, the Minister was empowered to make orders authorising the taking of water from specified sources, but this Act was a temporary measure. Ithas for long been a matter of complaint that undertakers seeking new sources of supply must incur the expense of an Act of Parliament or, as frequentlyhappens, avoid this necessity by paying an exorbitant price even though itmay be clear beyond all argument that the objecting interests could suffer no real injury whatever. Since 1919 the Minister has had power under theHousing Acts to authorise the taking of water for supplies to houses provided under those Acts. It is proposed that the Minister should be empowered byOrder to authorise undertakers to take water compulsorily. In most casesundertakers who seek to impound the head waters of a river are unde;statutory obligation to allow a specified amount of &quot; *compensation water&quot;to flow down the river for the benefit of riparian and other interests. Deter-mination of issues on this point should be within the scope of the MinistersOrder. It is also proposed to extend to all water undertakers operating under special Acts the powers as to compulsory acquisition of land which arealready possessed by some of these undertakers and by all undertakersoperating under the general enabling powers of the Public Health Acts.6. MODERNISATION OF THE LAWThe Waterworks Clauses Acts, 1847 and 1863, contain the general codewhich governs the operation of water undertakings and the relations, of under-takers with consumers and with other interests. They are incorporated,with or without modification, in the Special&apos; Acts and Provisional Orders of nearly every company, local authority or joint board supplying water under special powers. Their substance is also applied to local authorities operating under the Public Health Acts.Since the Acts of 1847 and 1863 were passed, the scale and circumstancesof water supplies have greatly changed, but in the absence of any generalrevision of the code, it has been left to the individual water undertaker, as opportunity arises, to apply for modification of the code in its application totheir undertaking. The result is that Special Acts and Provisional Orders,having been obtained at different times, differ much in their provisions and notinfrequently reflect the results of &quot; Parliamentary bargains &quot; between thewater undertakers and their opponents rather than any settled course ofwater policy. The Central Advisory Water Committee was so impressed with the disadvantages of the chaotic state of the law that they made it their first business to set on foot the drafting of a Water Undertakings Bill tomodernise and consolidate in a single measure the existing general Acts andthe Waterworks Clauses Acts and to introduce into the general law the most up-to-date of the common form clauses conceded by Parliament in local Acts.This Bill was taken up by the Government in 1939 and after exhaustiveexamination by a Joint Committee of both Houses, passed through theremaining stages in the House of Lords. Further progress was&apos; then stoppedby the outbreak of war. The Bill was reintroduced late in the 1943 Session,and was passed by the House of Lords but time could not be found for itsdiscussion in the House of Commons. The Government believe that ameasure of this type is an essential part of any reform, and it is their intentionto include it in the legislation which they will present to Parliament.* A note on compensation water will be found is Appendix C.
7. RURAL WATER SUPPLIESThere is an immediate need for further extension of piped supplies in rurallocalities, and for the provision of corresponding sewerage facilities to dealwith waste water and sewage. The difficulty of securing such extension^ in rural localities is well known and is due to the relatively high cost of laying the necessary mains and pipes as compared with the capacity of rural con-sumers and ratepayers in sparsely populated areas to meet that cost. Theneed is urgent and, with a view to speedy results, the Government considerit can best be met by following the precedent of 1934 and making furtherExchequer assistance available to rural localities where a satisfactory schemeis submitted and a case for such assistance can be made out.The Government propose therefore to invite Parliament to pass into lawduring the current Session a Bill, the text of which will shortly be available,naking further provision for Exchequer assistance towards.the extension &quot;ofpiped water supplies in rural localities. The Bill, unlike the Act of 1934,will extend such assistance to the provision of additional sewerage facilities.In other respects it is proposed that the Bill should follow the same general lines as that Act, but the Exchequer provision proposed is a total of 15,000,000 for England and Wales in respect of water supply and sewerage,as compared with a sum of  1,000,000 for water supply only in 1934.The Bill will contain certain additional provisions. It will be made clearthat the duty of local authorities to secure the provision of water schemes isa duty to secure piped supplies where practicable, and to provide thosesupplies in such a way that the - pipes are brought to a point at which thehouse owner can conveniently connect his own pipe with the main.The Bill will also provide that in rural districts expenses of water supply(so far as they are not paid directly by consumers) and of sewerage will infuture be charged to the general rate and thus spread over the ratepayers ofthe district as a whole instead of being charged as special expenses on the parish. Rural District Councils have had power to make this arrangementsince 1929, and under encouragement from the Ministry of Health and also from the Rural District Councils&apos; Association a very large number of them have done so. It is considered that the time has now come when specialexpenses in respect of water and sewerage should be finally abolished. Thiswill bring these services into line with the Housing service.It is also proposed to include in the Bill a clause (based on a similar provision in the Water Undertakings Bill of last Session) to provide that wherea local authority undertakes to pay any deficiency in water income until such time as the statutory undertakers receive from consumers the annual income(usually one-eighth of the cost of extending the mains) which would have enabled the consumers to require a supply, the undertakers shall be obligedto lay any necessary mains and give the supply. Expenditure by a localauthority on this head will be eligible for grant in proper cases.It is estimated that the result of the work done under the Act of 1934 wasto reduce the number of persons living in rural districts and not served bya piped supply to about 30 per cent, of the population of those districts (or per cent, of the total population of England and Wales). If the.present Bill,with its far larger Exchequer grant, becomes law and is correspondinglysuccessful, this percentage should be reduced to very small proportions andpiped water should be made available to practically all sizeable groups ofhouses, one of the important objectives set out in the Report of the ScottCommittee - on Land Utilisation in Rural Areas. There will, however,inevitably remain a certain number of houses which are so remote and isolated
that the extension of a public main would not be a reasonable proposition,e.g., where the cost of the extension would many times exceed the value ofthe house. The extension of piped supplies to groups of houses under theproposed Bill will go some way to reduce the size of this problem, since housesat present isolated may be so situated as to enable them to link up with thenew mains. The extension of mains will also often enable a supply to begiven to farms and farm buildings on the route, a matter of great importance from the point of view of milk production and the development of leyfarming. In the same &quot;way the numerous farm water supply schemes that have been, and are being, installed with financial assistance from the Ministryof Agriculture often facilitate the supply of piped water to isolated farm houses and cottages. The two Ministries will keep in olose touch so as to ensureco-ordination between their activities. The precise extent of the residualproblem will not be fully disclosed until the proposals submitted by localauthorities under the Bill afford a general picture and enable an estimate to bo,made of the houses which cannot be supplied by these means. M8. THE SERVICE IN scotland the historical development of the water supply service has followed much the same course in Scotland as in England and Wales, and much of what has already been said about the present state of the service and the needsof the future applies equally to the two countries. With her generous rainfalland wealth of upland catchment areas, Scotland abounds in water resources which are more than ample to meet all foreseeable demands, even though these demands are increasing with the development of modern sanitation andfor other reasons. A country which can undertake the far-reaching hydro-electric developments now contemplated in the north of Scotland need never be suspected of lacking an abundant supply of water for industrial and domestic purposes. Already, piped supplies some of them it is true inade-quate for modern requirements and imperfect in quality have been carriedto all urban and many rural communities: but there remains something short of one-third of the rural population, living for the most part in small groups of houses in rural areas and on farms, who have yet to be served. As inEngland and Wales the immediate problem is to meet this need- by bringingwater from suitable sources to the places where it is required to improveexisting supplies and to secure a more economical and . effective use of available resources. There is also the same need as exists in England andWales to build up a body of accurate information with regard to water resourcesbased upon surveys and. scientific observation which will guide long-termwater policy in the future. Alongside this similarity of conditions, however;there are important differences affecting the water supply systems in the twocountries, differences of geography, local government structure, law and organisation.In Scotland, the public water supplies are almost entirely in the handsof local authorities. There are 210 public water undertakers, comprising32 county councils, 170 town councils, six water boards (being combinationsof local authorities under Special Acts) and two small non-statutory watercompanies. These two companies serve only about 2,500 people. Approxi-mately 90 per cent, of the total population of Scotland is served by the pipedsupplies of local authorities; the remaining ro per cent, are landward popula-tion who are served by private piped supplies connected to individual houses,and by private estate systems, or have no piped supplies at all.The powers and duties of local authorities to provide water supplies are contained in the Burgh Police (Scotland) Acts, the Public Health (Scotland)Act, 1897, or local Acts.   Among these is the general obligation imposed byJ
the Act of 1897 on landward local authorities to &quot; provide their district orany part thereof with a supply of water where such supply is required and can be provided at a reasonable cost.&quot; County Councils have in many casesimplemented this duty by forming special water supply districts under theAct of 1897. A special water supply district is an area carved out of a county for the purpose of providing a purely local water supply on the, principle that the cost should be borne by the special district itself throughthe levying of a special district water rate. This principle has been modified by later legislation to enable a County Council to make a contribution to thecost of a special district water supply in certain circumstances. In all, over400 special water supply districts have been formed, each with its separatewater rates. Whatever the future of the special district machinery may be a matter which is referred to later it is generally agreed that in the pastit has been a most effective instrument in securing the provision of local pipedwater. supplies in landward areas which otherwise might have had to wait^iany years before obtaining this benefit.The outline of the Scottish water organisation is completed by the arrange-ments which certain water undertakers have made to provide supplies in theareas of more than one local authority. These arrangements are of three main types. First, there are the six statutory water boards already mentionedwhich have been formed as separate undertakers by combinations of neigh-bouring local authorities for the supply of water to their combined districts.Next, a number of local authorities supply neighbouring areas on a&quot; customer &quot; basis, either under the provisions of a local Act or by agree-ment. In the main this arrangement comprises the supply of water by burghallocal authorities to special water supply districts or villages in the neighbouring landward areas, though the cities and larger burghs have also agreed tosupply neighbouring small burghs. The third type of arrangement is that under which two or more local authorities have combined for water supplypurposes under the general statutes without involving the formation of separate undertakers in the shape of water boards.The service, with its 210 water undertakers operating over 700 under-takings in all, has grown up piecemeal without any effective co-ordination.It is surprising, therefore, that it should have established as good a recordas it has. The service as a whole has justified itself by giving the countryalmost complete immunity from water-borne disease, and by providing themajority of the population with an adequate supply of water. Some ofthe individual undertakings have, indeed, achieved a high standard of efficiency of which they are justly proud. But no one can deny that;largely because of the manner and circumstances of its growth, the service has serious defects. These have come to light spasmodically in relation to particular undertakings or groups of undertakings; there has never beencompiled any comprehensive statement about the condition and needs of theScottish water supply service as a whole, based on the application of uniformstandards of investigation. Feeling, therefore, that the existing standards of many water undertakers were lagging behind the advance of modern tech-nique, the Secretary of State in 1943 instituted a complete water surveyto ascertain a comprehensive body of information about the source, works,quality, quantity and distribution of existing supplies, and the need for im-proved, extended or new supplies, with special references to areas in Scotlandnot at present served by public systems.The survey, which is still in progress, is expected to be substantially com-pleted by the end of 1944. Already, however, much valuable information has been compiled revealing not only deficiencies of supply in particular areasbut defects in the existing systems.   One of the most unsatisfactory features
is the lack of co-operation among undertakers, particularly when new works were being provided. In many cases different undertakings have laidparallel mains in the same road. In other cases trunk mains have been carried through villages having no public water system without any supply being given off. This has resulted in the setting up of a multiplicity of small under-takings when the needs might have been met with greater economy and efficiency by combination. In some cases also, the operation and the super-vision of small undertakings have, because of limited resources, been left ininexperienced hands. In such circumstances the case for joint action byneighbouring undertakers, preferably in agreement but if necessary by theuse of compulsory powers to be vested by statute in the Secretary of Statecan hardly be overstated.All this receives emphasis from other unsatisfactory conditions revealedby the survey so far as it has gone. Many of the smaller water supplies are inadequate at arjy time and seriously inadequate in dry spells; gatheringgrounds are in some cases located too near to places of public resort, or on&quot;agricultural land, and so are open to pollution; proper headworks are some-times lacking or, if provided, are too small; treatment works, where provided,are in several cases maintained inexpertly. As often as not these faults arethe result of past failure to foresee the benefits of co-operation in bigger andmore efficient schemes.The time for considering joint action is now, when planning for housingdevelopments on a large scale is in progress. The demand for water is increasing and will continue to increase with the elimination of unfithouses without proper sanitation and with the growing recognition of theplace of water in matters of personal hygiene. Increased demands willrender many supplies inadequate which are at present barely adequate for current demands.The first step which the Government propose to take in order to remedythese deficiencies and defects-is to provide Exchequer assistance towards theextension of piped water supplies in rural localities not at present served,and to improve existing supplies in such localities. As indicated on pageof this Paper they will shortly invite Parliament to consider a Bill for thispurpose. The financial provisions of the Bill will apply both to- England andWales and to Scotland and will extend assistance not only to the provision and improvement of water supplies but to the provision of sewerage facilities in rural localities. The amount of the Exchequer assistance proposed forScotland is  6,375,000 in respect of water supplies and sewerage, as comparedwith a sum of  137,500 made available for water supplies by the Rural water supplies Act, 1934. Jt is intended that this sum will be expended in aid ofcapital works undertaken over a period of years and that the greater part ofit will be devoted to the provision of new and the improvement of existingwater supplies.The conditions governing the distribution of the grant have yet to be deter-mined. It may be taken, however, that normally assistance will be availableonly for work under approved schemes in landward areas, and not for work done in burghs. But the possibility of the town council of a small burghsharing in. the grants is not ruled out; its participation will largely depend,among other things, on whether the burgh is predominantly rural in character,and on the advantages which would accrue from its inclusion in a widerscheme.The experience gained in connection with the administration of the grants,made available under the Act of 1934 showed that the best results were obtained,when the works undertaken were on a substantial scale.   Only a few schemes
of this nature could, however, be assisted from the restricted amount of thetotal grant then available, and even so the greater part of the assistance wasearned by one or two authorities who were themselves able to support a sub-stantial financial burden. The much larger total grant now proposed willenable the Government to encourage a correspondingly larger number ofworth-while schemes, and with this in view, it is their intention to arrange the distribution of the assistance in such a way as to make it possible for the poorer local authorities in rural areas and in the Highlands and Islands,where there is a clamant need for new or improved water supplies, to under-take schemes within their capacity.The distribution of a grant of the magnitude proposed adds a new emphasisto the case for the administration of water supplies over wider areas. In theirReport on Rural Housing in Scotland, the Scottish Housing Advisory Com-mittee strongly recommended the tsking of measures at the earliest possiblefoment to that end. The information so far available as a result of theengineering survey referred to on page confirms the case for widerareas of administration. What is required could be achieved without any interference with the structure of Scottish local government. As has been indicated, combinations of local authorities are already in being for watersupply purposes. But, if progress is to be made along the lines envisaged by the Government within a reasonable period of time, and if the proposed new grant is to be distributed to the best advantage, it may not be possiblein every case to depend on the formation of voluntary combinations.Experience shows that a single authority and not always one with the major interest may remain unco-operative. As already indicated inparagraph it is therefore proposed that the . Secretary of state should have power, in such circumstances, to require authorities to combine for water supply purposes, subject to provision being made for full consultation and public local inquiry. It may prove both desirable and fair that the actual management of certain undertakings within the area ofcombination should be left to their present owners. The instrument of com-bination would take account of such matters.The increasing need for the adoption of wider administrative areas for water supply purposes raises the question whether the time has come tooverhaul the special water supply district machinery referred to on pageIf, in accordance with the policy outlined above, adequate supplies are to be extended to fill in gaps which exist at present, the special watersupply district will increasingly tend to lose its significance as a proper uniteither for constructional works or for rating purposes. This matter wasconsidered by the Committee on Scottish Health Services who, while acknow-ledging the distinct value to the health services which the special districtsystem had been in the past, came to the conclusion that it had outlived itsusefulness. They therefore recommended that existing special districts forenvironmental services should be abolished, but that power should be givento the central authority to sanction the retention or formation of a specialdistrict in exceptional circumstances. This recommendation, of course, raisesissues affecting a wider field than that of water supply. It extends to specialdistricts formed for sewerage and drainage, scavenging and cleansing, lighting,and public baths. The Secretary of State, therefore, proposes to discuss with the Association of Local Authorities what, if any, amendments in thelaw should be made in this respectTurning now from rural water supplies to the wider question of futureplanning and policy, the different conditions in Scotland will require some modification of the proposals contemplated for England and Wales.   The
0differences which have already been noted in the local government structure,the existing law as regards water supply and the organisation of the watersupply service will have to be taken into account in the application to scotland of some of the legislative proposals outlined on page ofthis Paper. For example, since county councils in Scotland are alreadywater authorities and have power to combine for providing water suppliesno amendment of the law such as is proposed for England and Wales to achieve these objects is required. Further, in Scotland the existing lawenables the Secretary of State to authorise water undertakers to take waterfrom any source. Indeed, what is proposed on page on this subject,is to bring the English law broadly into line with the existing position inScotland. Again, as has been indicated, the system of statutory watercompanies does not obtain in Scotland and therefore powers for dealing withthe default of such companies are not required. But subject to these andany other instances where the proposals are not wholly applicable to Scotti^,conditions, it is proposed that broadly parallel legislative action should betaken in the two countries. In particular, this will include the introduction into Parliament of legislative proposals to modernise the general code oflaw governing the operations of water undertakers contained in the Water-works Clauses Acts, 1847 and 1863.It is proposed that there should be a Central Advisory Water Committeefor Scotland, constituted by statute, with functions broadly similar to those proposed to be assigned to the corresponding Advisory Committee for Englandand Wales. Scotland does not, however,, readily lend itself to a suitabledivision into water supply regions which would be of such a size as to justifythe appointment of a regional advisory water committee in each. looking to the smaller task involved, as compared with that in England and Wales,it should be possible in Scotland to ascertain whether joint action amongwater undertakers is desirable for the rationalisation of water supplies andthe planning of new sources,. without the appointment of regional advisorywater committees. It is therefore thought that the needs in Scotland will be adequately met by a single central advisory body, whose constitution and functions might be suitably, enlarged if this should be thought necessary.9. SUMMARY OF proposals the object of the Government&apos;s proposals is the shaping of a national waterpolicy which will ensure a planned and economical use of the water resourcesof the country and efficient administration of water supply services. The pro-ppsals are based on three principles:  (i) Adequate control of water supply services, but control to&apos; be increased!. and other changes to be made only where change can be justified by greater efficiency or reduction of costs.(ii) Responsibility for water supply to rest with democratic bodies at thecentre with Ministers responsible to Parliament; at the circumference (withoutunnecessary change in the present organisation of statutory undertakers) with local authorities responsible to their electorates.(iii) Sectional interests to be subordinate to the national interest, but allwhose interests are affected by water development schemes to have a rightto be heard by the Minister or, where appropriate, by Parliament.The proposals, framed in the light of these principles, are summarised below:(a) The Health Ministers, whose powers are at present vague and ill-defined,to be given the statutory duty of promoting the provision of adequate water supplies^ and the conservation of water resources.

PART IIRIVER BOARDSThe subject of the Third Report of the Central Advisory Water Com-mittee is the constitution of new bodies with comprehensive powers and duties in relation to rivers or groups of rivers, who would take over some or all ofthe functions of the various bodies at present responsible for land-drainage,fisheries, the prevention of pollution, and, to some extent, navigation. TheCommittee heard evidence from numerous bodies concerned and recommendthat there should be constituted for England and Wales 29 River Boards,which would take over the land-drainage functions of the existing catchmentboards, the functions of the existing authorities (some 1,600 in number) re-sponsible for preventing pollution under the Rivers Pollution Prevention Actsand other enactments, and all the powers and duties of Fishery Boards. Thevfurther recommend that while navigation powers as are at presenwpossessed by catchment boards should be taken over by the new RiverBoards, the new Boards should not generally be navigation authorities but should limit their function to land-drainage, prevention of pollution and thecontrol of fisheries. There should, however, be power to the Ministers ofHealth and Agriculture and Fisheries to transfer navigation functions by jointorder, on the application of a River Board, where this course seems desirableto them, after consultation with the Minister of Transport.The new Boards would have no responsibility for water supply as such,nor would they have any power to veto the abstraction of water from theriver by a water undertaker. They would, however, have the right to be heard on any application by a water undertaker for such powers. In thisconnection they would take the place of their various constituent authorities who are at present entitled to be (and commonly are) heard on such appli-cations; and it is anticipated that such divergencies of interest as may exist between different classes of river users will normally be reconciled in dis-cussion by the River Board as a whole who will speak on the applicationwith one voice. The task of the River Boards would be primarily to control&quot;rivers in the general interest, and they would have the particular duty ofgauging the flow of rivers and maintaining records.The majority of the members of these Boards should consist of repre-sentatives of Councils of Counties and County Boroughs within the water-shed area or areas with which each Board is concerned. These Councilswould in most cases have to find the bulk of the revenue for the new Boardsthough the Boards would also have other sources of revenue such as Govern-ment grants for land-drainage schemes/precepts on internal drainage boards,navigation tolls, and fishery licences. Other interests (e.g., internal drainage,fisheries and navigation) would be directly represented according to the nature and use of the river. The Committee recommend that the procedure insetting up the Boards should follow closely that which was adopted for Catch-ment Boards under the Land Drainage Act of 1930. The Act to provide forthe constitution of River Boards would schedule the areas for which they areto be set up. It would empower the Ministers of Health and of Agricultureand Fisheries by joint order to set up, and determine the constitution of, aBoard for each of such areas. Provision would be made for the holding of apublic inquiry at which all interests affected could be heard.The Government accept these recommendations in principle, as regardsEngland and Wales, and propose as part of their programme to prepare aBill to give effect to them.
The position in Scotland is in some respects different from that in Englandand Wales. The investigation of the Central Advisory Water committee did not extend to Scotland, and the Committee did not hear evidence from the interested Scottish bodies. Moreover, in Scotland land drainage functionsrest, not with catchment boards as in England and Wales, but with theSecretary of State acting through the Department of Agriculture for Scotland.The Scottish Advisory Committee on Rivers Pollution Prevention, however,in their Sixth Report, submitted to the Department of Health for scotland in 1936, proposed that suitable catchment areas should be delimited for thepurposes of the Rivers Pollution Prevention Acts, and that a River Board,which would become the authority for the administration of these Acts, shouldbe established for each catchment area.The Government are satisfied that improvements with regard to the adminis-tration of the Rivers Pollution Prevention Acts in Scotland are necessary, but^having in view the different conditions prevailing there, it has yet to .bedetermined whether&apos;these improvements can best be achieved by the settingup of River Boards or in some other way. The Secretary of State accord-ingly proposes to open discussions on this question with the Associations oflocal authorities and the other interests concerned at an early date.APPENDIX a growth AND DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC WATER supplies the supply of wholesome water as a public service has a long and creditablehistory in this country. Conducted by local authorities and statutory companies in its earlier days very largely by the latter, though to-day about 80 per cent,of the undertakings are municipally owned it was a pioneer public health service to which is due in great part the credit for achieving and maintaining our present high degree of immunity from typhoid and other water-borne diseases.Some public water undertakings have a long continuous history. Hull was empowered to supply water as long ago as 1447 by Royal Charter of King HenryVI; Plymouth&apos;s first Water Act dates from 1585, and was a civil venture of thatgreat adventurer Sir Francis Drake, who secured nomination to the parliamentary committee considering the Bill and was given the contract for the works by theCorporation in 1590, having in the interval dealt with the Spanish Armada and paid a memorable visit to Cadiz. Probably the best known of these early projectswas London&apos;s New River, completed by Sir Hugh Myddelton in 1613 with the help of funds provided by King James I in return for a half share in the under-taking. But it was long before public water supply services were at all general in our towns.Fear is a potent prime mover. It was mainly fear of cholera that led to &quot; thesanitary idea &quot; becoming dominant in local government rather less than 100 yearsago. &quot; Upon the examination of the statements and answers from the towns towhich our enquiries have been directed &quot; said the Duke of Buccleuch&apos;s RoyalCommission in 1844 &apos;&apos; it appears that in only six instances could the arrangements and supplies be deemed in any comprehensive sense good; while in thirteen they appear to be indifferent, and in thirty-one so deficient as to be pronounced bad,and, so far as yet examined, frequently inferior in purity.&quot; The Trent Water-works Company at Nottingham supplied 8,000 houses, and there was also a rivalcompany, but 70,000 houses had no regular or adequate supplies; in Bristol only,000 out of 130,000 people had water laid on; in Birmingham 8,000 houses outof 40,000; in Coventry 300-400 houses out of 7,200; in Newcastle 8 per cent.; andso on.    :The Commission recommended that local authorities should have definite respon-sibilities for water supplies as well as drainage. From this time onwards, at firstslowly but with gradually increasing momentum, the provision of town&apos;s waterbecame more general, though it was not until the Public Health Acts of 1872-8 thatthe duty wais placed upon sanitary authorities generally to secure the provision&apos;
of wholesome and sufficient water for the needs of their area. For the remainder of the century public health policy was aimed at securing better environmental services (&quot; the policy of, mains and drains &quot;) until the personal health servicesand, later,&apos; housing began to compete for public attention as further fields for public activity.But, for the very reason that it was one of our earliest public services, water-supply organisation has suffered the handicaps of the pioneer. The service grewup in the age of the horse and cart, when the unit of action was the parish orthe town, long before there was any conception of a wider integration. So it isthat the legislative framework is to-day largely obsolete. The Waterworks ClausesAct, for example, dates from 1847 and is quite unsuited to modern conditions, butit- is still the only statutory model in the general law for Bills and Orders regulating the management of individual water undertakings and their relations with con-sumers and other interests.. In the latter years of the 19th century Parliament became increasingly busy indealing with applications for new water undertakings, and as many as 50 locaMBills tor the grant or extension of power to supply water might reach the statute book in a single Session. Sometimes the applicants were local authorities usuallyborough or urban authorities sometimes combinations of these and sometimes,groups of private persons or even single individuals. The general form of thelegislation followed familiar lines. The sources of supply and the area to be served (&quot; limits of supply &quot;) were closely defined as were the nature and site of the works to be undertaken. In the case of statutory companies the amount ofcapital was fixed and the disposition of profits in the shape of dividends limited.The requirements of the original Act could be altered only by a fresh applicationto Parliament for an extension or modification of powers. Most rural and manyurban authorities were content to use the general powers of the Public HealthActs without seeking special legislation. Again, in some cases, private persons would form limited companies to carry on small undertakings without seeking the special powers (e.g. of laying mains under public roads), conferred on thestatutory undertakers. Sometimes also a landowner providing his own estate withwater would include in the service outlying hamlets or single nouses and an under-taking of a quasi-public kind, though without statutory powers or obligations,would grow up.For a long time local sources, which had in fact determined the location andgrowth of local communities, met or were made to meet local needs. But citiesand towns grew bigger and the consumption of water per head also rose. The bigcities especially had to go further afield for their supplies. Thus between 1879and 1904 Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham developed and brought into usesources 106, 68 and 74 miles away from the area supplied. These were the most striking examples.   There were many.others.The system grew up piece-meal, with resultant overlapping and waste, duesometimes to commendable local initiative, sometimes to-local rivalries, most ofall probably to lack of timely and exact information and to lack at the centre of adequate effective powers of stimulation and decision, as opposed to merelyrestrictive control. There were unhappy results in unregulated competition forsources; there were wasteful absurdities such as two undertakers drawingseparately on the same distant source by mains passing largely down the sameroute; there was competitive pumping between undertakers. That there was not even more waste and overlapping was probably due more to good fortune andinnate good sense than to any effective central control, since the control whichthe machinery of the Legislature could exercise in these matters was inevitablyrestrictive rather than constructive. Parliament is bound to consider what is put before it by promoters of Bills. It can say &quot; Yes &quot; or &quot; No &quot;, and it doeson occasion say &quot; No &quot;, but it is not in a position to devise, propound, or enforcealternative and better ways of securing a supply.The widespread need of going further afield for future supplies increasinglyemphasised the lack of a policy of marking out spheres of interest, of marryingsurpluses&apos;to deficiencies, of-long-term planning based on &apos; the fullest possible information and estiiriates.   In 1924 the Ministry of Health started to encourage
the formation of Regional Advisory Water Committees for important areas having a common water problem. There are nine of these Committees on which water undertakers in the region, County Councils and the Ministry of Health are repre-sented, the Ministry&apos;s representative in some cases acting as Chairman, covering the areas of 354 water undertakers, with a total population of 16,000,000, and within the limits of present powers they have done useful work*.The Water Pollution Research Board of the Department of Scientific and In-dustrial Research was set up in 1927 for the purpose of research on the preventionof the pollution of rivers and other sources of water supply by industrial effluentsand sewage. It has rendered great services, not least in war time, towards cleaningup, and averting new threats to, the rivers which are the major source of ourpublic water supplies, and has in a number of ways been of assistance not onlyto the public water supplies but also to agriculture, industry and fisheries.In the latter part of 1932 and in 1933 there was much less than average rainfall,and the result was almost unprecedented drought in 1934. Three Acts of con-fesiderable importance, two of them temporary in character, were passed in thatyear. The first, &quot;the Water Supplies (Exceptional Shortage Orders) Act, enabled the Minister of Health by Order to authorise Water Undertakers to tap new sources including rivers and streams; to abolish or modify legal restrictions onthe amount to be taken from various sources; to reduce the amount of com-pensationf water; to authorise undertakers to restrict use both generally and byparticular consumers. In addition the Minister could direct one undertaker tosupply another, and could limit or prohibit use of a particular source by anyperson (including another water undertaker), if taking water from that sourceaffected supplies of any undertaker. Further, an Order authorising the taking of water from any source could, if this were necessary, authorise permanent works and the taking of water for an indefinite period and the purchase (compulsorilyor by agreement) of any necessary land. These powers expired on 31st December,1935-The second Act, the Rural Water Supplies Act, made ^1,000,000 of Exchequermoney available by way of grants to stimulate the provision of water supplies in rural localities, hitherto an obstinate problem owing to the high cost of distribu-tion in relation to the local financial resources. The grant resulted in work beingcarried out to the value of between ^6,000,000 and ^7,000,000 and in the provisionof piped water supply schemes in some 2,000 parishes. The present position is that about 70 per cent, of the inhabitants of rural districts now have a piped supplyor are within reasonable distance of a main to which connection can be made..The third Act of 1934, the Supply of Water in Bulk Act, is a general enablingAct under which a water undertaker can provide another with a bulk supply withthe consent of the Minister of Health. The Act confers certain ancillary powers,provides safeguards for other undertakers, requires the publication of notices, and provides for the hearing of objections. Before 1934, water undertakers operating under special Acts and wishing to enter into such agreements were obliged to seek the necessary powers by Bill.In 1935 there was set up the Inland Water Survey to collect and correlateavailable records of surface and underground waters, to encourage the keeping ofrecords and to make the results generally available. This work had not proceededvery far when war caused its suspension in great part so far as surface wateris concerned, but records of flow had been instituted for 20 river basins J.From 1923 onwards, the Ministry of Health had benefited by the advice and assistance of an Advisory Committee on Water which made a number of im-portant recommendations for changes in law and practice. The constitution ofthis Committee, which consisted almost entirely of representatives of water under-takers, was adversely criticised in Parliament in 1935-6, on the general groundthat other water interests should also be consulted. Accordingly the Governmentin 1937 set up the Central Advisory Water Committee. This body is constituted on* A statement of the areas that they serve, of their constitution and of the progress theyhave made will be found on page    .t A note on compensation water will be found in Appendix C.t Further reference to this work will be found on page
a widely representative basis and is not limited to water supplies but is concernedwith watej generally. The Committee&apos;s first Report, which was published in 1938,dealt with underground water and with the general planning of water resources and supplies. Their second Report, in 1939 (Cmd. 5986-7), dealt mainly with the consolidation and amendment of various general Acts regulating the supply ofwater and with the simplification of procedure for obtaining additional powers,also with the important question of making water available for industry and agriculture. Their third Report (Cmd. 6465), which was presented to the Ministerof Health and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in 1943, advocates the setting up of River Boards to take over the functions of all existing localauthorities and bodies in relation to land drainage, prevention of pollution, and management of fisheries.A general picture of the present state of water supply in this country will havebeen gathered from the foregoing brief sketch of the development of public water undertakings during the last century. Broadly, the position is this. The natural,resources of the country in terms of rainfall are adequate and, indeed, far morsithan adequate for any demands that axe within reasonable contemplation. It isknown with tolerable certainty that after allowing for a loss of about 40 per cent,by evaporation, the quantity of water flowing into the rivers and streams andunderground collecting areas-all ultimately derived from rainfall probablyamounts to about twenty times the total present consumption of water for domestic and industrial purposes in England and Wales as a whole. Surface water fromrivers, streams and springs forms-the chief source of supply, about three-quarters of the population being thus provided. Moreover, because of the much improvedmethods of purification evolved in recent years, greater use is being made, and canstill be made, of water drawn from the lower levels of mountain areas, wherethe land is to some extent cultivated, and also from the lower reaches of rivers,a very important fact in relation to water supplies. Underground water, however,is a valuable source of domestic water supplies in many areas, e.g., that found inthe chalk of Kent and Surrey and other areas, in the Bunter Sandstone of Notting-hamshire, where it forms the only readily available source for large populations,and in the area of the Lincolnshire limestone.Thus the problem in this country is not, as in many others, to eke out an in-adequate supply to the best advantage. It is to obtain from resources which,taking the country as a whole, are abundant, such supplies as are needed; to conserve and use them in accordance with a planned economy which will ensurethat all available resources are used to the best advantage, and to secure properdistribution. In most of our great cities, the water undertakers, whether muni-cipal or company, can look with legitimate pride on what has been achieved. the scientific knowledge, technical skill and enterprise which have gone to the supply-itig of water to London, Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield,not to mention other cities, have been of the highest standard and the local administration of these large undertakings calls for no apology. This is true in varying degrees in many of the smaller towns and also over large parts of the countryside.The normal abundance and regularity of rainfall in this country means that less head works and storage capacity are needed than would otherwise be the case.But the striking of a balance between over-insurance and under-insurance is seldomeasy, and heavy over-insurance would mean that the consumer would pay morethan he should. Conditions of prolonged drought such as occurred in 1933-4,coupled with a rising demand, create strain and difficulties in places. The water undertakings as a whole stood up Well to the conditions of 1934, with the help of special emergency measures and restrictions on consumption, and in few caseswas there serious hardship. It became clear, however, in many instances that theundertakers were working on too narrow a margin of reserves against the risk of exceptional and long continued shortage of rain. Many new works were executedor planned in the years 1934-39. Large schemes inevitably take a considerable time to plan and execute, and a number of schemes representing an expendituremeasured in millions of pounds were held, up by the outbreak of war. In additionto delaying important new works the war has through the redistribution of popula-
APPENDIX BTHE INFLUENCE OF GEOLOGICAL FACTORSON WATER SUPPLY IN GREAT BRITAINcontributed byTHE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF GREAT BRITAIN (DEPARTMENT of scientific AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH)Water supplies*, surface and underground, are derived more or less directly from rainfall, which over Great Britain as a whole is ample for all requirements.Owing, however, to geological, climatic and other factors, there is much variationfrom place to place in the facility with which water is obtainable. Prolongedperiods of drought may produce local shortages in both surface and undergroundsupplies.SURFACE supplies the present account is primarily designed to show the influence of geology onunderground water supply in Great Britain, but a passing reference may be madeto geological factors involved in the provision of surface supplies. These supplies are obtained from springs, rivers and lakes, and from artificially constructedstorage reservoirs.British rivers generally have a relatively high dry-weather flow, and in conse-quence provide dependable sources of water-supply. In English rivers inparticular this dry-weather flow is maintained by rainfall which is absorbed intothe ground, to re-appear at the surface, sometimes after months of undergroundtravel, as springs and seepages. Some springs are permanent, others intermittent.Partly on account of its geological structure, and partly of its topography, whichis itself an expression of the underlying geological structure, England possessesa great number of permanent springs widely distributed over its area. Thus duringnormal dry-weather periods its rivers are replenished at intervals along theircourses, either directly from springs or from tributaries fed by springs.In upland areas river flow is less regular, but even so an appreciable dry-weathervolume is often maintained by seepages from peat and other surface deposits. Inthe upland areas of Wales, the Lake District and Scotland various lakes conservethe natural drainage from some of the elevated surface catchment areas, and alsoregulate the flow of rivers which issue from.them.* In the present account the term &quot; water [supply &quot; is used to connote a large orrelatively large yield, sufficient for not less than the requirements of a village.tion and industry imposed a very considerable additional strain, which has how-ever in many cases been met by increased supplies provided under emergency powers. It is also fair to say that in other cases, the&apos; presence of aerodromes,factories, etc., has enabled supplies for domestic use to be provided or improved.The quality of water supplies is best reflected in the incidence of waterbornedisease. &apos; On this point the evidence is convincing. The history of the past centuryshows a steadily rising curve of immunity. Cholera which first appeared in thiscountry in 1830, and was for more than thirty years a serious menace, virtuallydisappeared with the century. The deaths from typhoid fever fell from a yearlyaverage of 320 per million of the population in the decade 1871 to 1880 to a yearlyaverage of less than 5 per million in the years from 1931 to 1940.Moreover, it cannot be said that the- cost of water supply is a heavy burden on the ordinary citizen. The cost of a domestic supply is normally borne in the shape of a water rate assessed, like other rates, on the value of the house. water rates vary in different areas, but it is exceptional for the poundage of the rate to xceed 2s. 6d. In a typical working-class home with a rent of 10s. the charge for water would generally be under a penny a day, a sum which is appreciablyless than the normal expenditure of the householder on gas or electricity.A general indication of the defects in the present law and practice relating to water supply is given in Chapter 1 of Part I of this Paper.
i Much upland surface drainage is to-day impounded for water-supply in storagereservoirs. The choice of a site for such a reservoir involves a number Of con-siderations,. only some of which are geological. They include rainfall; shape of ground&apos; above the site, determining catchment area; shape of ground at the site,defining potential capacity; elevation with reference to distribution area; water-tightness of natural walls; stability and water-tightness of dam foundations.An ideal site for a storage reservoir is a large elongated steep-sided valley,cut in rocks impermeable to water. Valleys of this kind are restricted to uplanddistricts. Geological structures occurring in such districts are, however, oftencomplicated, and are by no means always favourable to retentive valley sides.In consequence the geology of a valley selected for a reservoir needs careful investigation. The engineering problem of design and construction of dam founda-tions is equally closely bound up with geology. Complications&apos; commonly result from the presence of superficial deposits such as gravel and boulder clay. Othersmay arise from localised near-surface adjustments of the rocks in response to change of load effected during the slow excavation of the valley by naturasi!processes of erosion.: &apos; &quot;Upland reservoirs of the kind just mentioned have been made in Wales, theLake District, the Pennines and Scotland, and provide very large supplies whichflow long distances under gravity, as from Thirlmere to Manchester. Others, lesselevated, yield gravity supplies to centres relatively near them, as in Devon andthe Midlands.In low-lying districts of England surface storage reservoirs have been constructedwith artificial walls (excavated or built) to impound river waters, for instance thereservoirs of the Metropolitan Water Board. Pressure head for distribution isprovided by pumping. The siting of these reservoirs is determined on the onehand by proximity to the population to be served, and on the other by the possi-bilities of finding an impermeable floor such as is afforded by the London Clay.UNDERGROUND SUPPLIES. The presence or absence of underground water in the rocks* of the countrydepends on four main factors: nature of the rocks; geological structure; and theform of the ground; and depth of cover.Rocks are of two&apos; different natures, igneous and sedimentary. Igneous rocks are formed by consolidation from a molten state, and are usually hard, crystallineand impermeable to water. Granite and basalt are familiar examples. Some sedi-mentary rocks f are built up of the remains of pre-existing rocks, as pebble-beds,sands or muds laid down on the beds of seas, estuaries or lakes, or in some caseson dry land; others are precipitated from solution, either by organisms or directly,as. accumulations of shells, or of small rounded calcareous grains known as ooliths,or of calcareous mud, rock salt or gypsum.Pebble-beds and sands are highly porous and permeable; that is, they can storeand give free passage to water. They may subsequently consolidate into con-glomerates and sandstones, with partial loss of porosity, but this may be com-pensated by the development of cracks and fissures. Muds consolidate into claysand shales, which are impermeable. Shell beds, accumulations of ooliths andcalcareous muds consolidate into limestones ranging in type from the soft chalkof the Downs and the oolitic freestones of the Cotswolds to the hard &quot; MountainLimestone &quot; of Derbyshire. Some calcareous rocks suffer the further chemicalchange which converts them to magnesian limestone (dolomite). Many limestonesare highly permeable and carry water in numerous fissures, large and small; in the mountain Limestone type, while important water-bearing fissures do occur, theyare for the most part too infrequent to warrant well-sinking.* The term &quot;rock&quot; has two interpretations: to engineers, miners and others rockusually has some considerable degree of hardness; in the geological sense a rock is anysolid, bulky constituent r f the Earth&apos;s trust: On account of long employment in both sensesit is not pra ticable to limit the meaning to one or other usage; here the geologicalinterpretation is employed throughout.t Deposits not germane to the subject of underground water are not here considered.
The sedimentary rocks of Britain can be divided into two main groups accordingto their relative position: (i) superficial, the so-called drift deposits, which area discontinuous mantle of gravels, sands and clays, usually less than 100 feet thick,laid down during and since the Ice Age, and (2) the underlying older rocks formingthe great, mass of the country.The older sedimentary rocks are characteristically disposed in beds or strata. Anumber of associated beds may. be grouped into a convenient stratigraphicalunit termed a formation, with thickness measured in scores or hundreds of feet,and lateral extent measured often in scores and sometimes in hundreds of miles.The geological formations succeed one another with reasonable persistencethroughout large districts, as a result of earth movements since their deposition theyhave in most areas been tilted to a greater or lesser degree, and often have beenbent or folded into arches and troughs, and vertically displaced along fracturesknown as &quot; faults &quot;. In addition; since these earth movements took place greatparts of the rock succession have been eroded away.^The area over which a formation now appears at the ground surface is its out-crop. As a result of erosion, outcrops of successive formations are distributed in a complex pattern over the face of Great Britain.A permeable formation will constitute a permanent source of underground waterif it is sufficiently replenished from its catchment area, though it must be recog-nised that a formation that is permeable neaT its outcrop may become impermeablein depth owing to closure of its cavities by weight of soviet strata. Thecatchment area is usually the area over which the formation outcrops, but mayextend considerably beyond the outcrop to include contributory surface drainageareas. The intake of water which matters is the net intake, not the gross, and is determined not only by water added at the surface on the permeable outcrop butalso by water subtracted as a result of natural or artificial drainage. Thus wherea permeable formation is cut into hills and valleys, much of its outcrop abovethe local valley-bottom level may be dry. Moreover folds and faults produce agreat dive/sity of water-bearing potentialities in the different parts of a formation,both at outcrop and under cover; they may at one place provide an excellentnatural reservoir; while at another they may render an area relatively waterless.Distribution of permeable and impermeable formations-.Many of the most ancient sediments have been particularly closely compacted,that is, they have reached a degree of consolidation that has obliterated&apos;alleffective pore-space whatever the original type of rock. In extreme cases, wellrepresented in Scotland and Anglesey, compaction has been accompanied by somuch change that the rocks are spoken of as metamorphic. Such compactedsediments are essentially impermeable.An assemblage of igneous rocks and compacted sedimentary strata, from whichunderground water is not normally obtainable, constitutes the country rock of cornwall and parts of Devon, much of Wales, the Lake District, a few smallareas in Central England, and the greater part of Scotland. Rocks of this assem-blage also provide an impermeable foundation beneath the remaining formationsof Great Britain. .In these igneous rocks and compacted sediments water does, however, occur in sporadic fissures or belts of shattered material.- Extensive excavations such asmines often cut a sufficient number of these fissures to allow a free inflow of water.Thus abandoned mines on occasion provide underground supplies; but in regions of compaction advantage is generally taken of some local surface source, usuallya river or spring, or, where this is not possible water is piped from another district.Geologically newer and less compacted formations rest on this old impermeablefoundation. In Scotland, and to a very minor extent in England, they maycarry massive intercalations Of igneous rock, mainly as sheets of lava. Theycan be broadly divided for water-supply purposes into a lower and an upper group.The lower group of the newer formations tends to exhibit a fairly high degree ofconsolidation and. has been rather heavily affected by earth-movement; but itaffords some excellent sites for wells.   Its water-bearing rocks are sandstones with
0much of the water in fissures, and limestones belonging to the &quot; Mountain Lime-stones &quot;, the water-bearing character of which has already been indicated. Themain areas at the surface occupied by this lower group are the industrializedMidland Valley of Scotland; the Northumberland to Derbyshire belt, including thePennines and neighbouring coalfields; and South Wales.The upper group, the least consolidated formations, occupy the ground surface ofthe half of England that lies south-east of a somewhat sinuous line from Middles-brough to Exeter, with a broad loop extending from the Midland near Birminghamto include Manchester and Liverpool. Except in this loop the inclination of thestrata is usually eastward or south-eastward, and there is in consequence a generaltendency for the outcrops of the various formations to run in parallel bands from north to south or from north-east to south-west, with the later formations out-cropping to the south-east of the earlier. In this half of England lie the mostproductive water-bearing formations in Great Britain.A generalised description of the distribution of the succession of outcrops inthe south-eastern half of England is given below, but the following qualificatiq^,must always be borne in mind. If an area is described as productive, thisdescription only holds where local topographical and geological circumstanjces arefavourable to supply. Also, while in some clay areas described as unproductivewater in quantity is unobtainable at any depth, in others moderate yields may belocally obtainable from minor permeable intercalations in the clay, or even goodyields may be got from deep wells carried down to an underlying permeableformation. In the latter case it must be remembered that water tapped frombeneath deep cover some miles from a catchment is occasionally saline andu!npotable.Magnesian limestone, highly productive, runs from Sunderland to Nottingham;sandstones, highly productive, from the River Tees by Nottingham and Birming-ham to Liverpool; clays, unproductive, from Redcar by Leicester to Gloucesterand Taunton; oolitic limestones, productive, from Hull by Peterborough andCheltenham to the Dorset Coast; clays, unproductive, from the Wash, byBedford and Swindon to the Dorset Coast; sands, productive, from Cambridgeto Leighton Buzzard; clays, unproductive, from Cambridge, along the northernedge of the Chilterns, by Devizes to the Dorset Coast; chalk, particularly im-portant as a water-bearing formation, from Flamborough Head to Skegness, and thence from East Anglia, through the Chiltern Hills to Salisbury Plain, therebranching to reach the coast by the Dorset Heights and the North and SouthDowns.The course of the two last-named ridges represents a change from the generalnorth-east-to-south-west arrangement of outcrops to a more complicated east-to-west pattern. North of the North Downs lies the London Basin, containing aconsiderable thickness of sediments that overlie the chalk. These include thethick impermeable London Clay and separate the chalk outcrop of East Angliaand the Chiltern Hills, from that of the North Downs, though the chalk itself iscontinuous underground. Another component of the east-to-west pattern is theWealden Dome.* The chalk has been eroded from the centre of this dome,exposing lower formations between the chalk outcrops of the North and SouthDowns. One of these pre-chalk formations is a productive sand which joinsunderground with the sand of the Cambridge-Leighton-Buzzard area, previouslymentioned. In the Weald it extends from Folkestone to Petersfield and back toEastbourne. Inside this circuit lies an extensive belt of impermeable unproductiveclay, from Romney Marsh to near Haslemere, and back to Pevensey. within this, between Horsham and Hastings, lies a central area of permeable sands withinterbedded impermeable clays.Drift Deposits.The relatively thin mantle of unconsolidated drift deposits, which is spreadover a great part of the country requires but brief reference.   Drift depositsvary in type from coarse gravel to heavy clay. In many places they are quite* &quot; Dome&quot; is used geologically to describe a structure characterised by outwardinclination of strata the reverse of a basin.
14unproductive or will yield only small scale domestic supplies; but locally they come into prominence. There are some areas, otherwise unproductive, wheregravels yield sufficient water to satisfy the needs of a large town. Conversely,there are extensive tracts of permeable strata where drift clays prevent adequatepercolation of rainfall and restrict the output.Contamination.The question of disposal of sewage and industrial effluent cannot be divorced from that of underground water supply. Strata which freely absorb rainfall alsoabsorb other liquid matter which may reach them. In limestones in particular,with their fissure systems of water circulation, noxious fluids may rapidly travellong distances. No sewage or other objectionable matter should be dischargedwhere it is likely to affect the purity of underground water.Conclusion.iji As geological knowledge of the country increases it becomes progressivelywasier to delimit areas which are favourable and unfavourable for the exploita-tion of underground water, both as regards the quality and quantity of yield,and the nature and thickness of strata to be pierced. Each prospective well-site presents its own problems and needs individual consideration. The accuracywith which an assessment can be made depends upon the local geologicalevidence available.The Geological Survey has issued a long series of publications dealing with supplies of underground water in many parts of the country. In addition it holdsmuch unpublished material in its files which is available without fee to interestedinquirers. It has altogether assembled, indexed and correlated some 40,000 records of existing deep wells, with details of yields and strata. Geological Survey mapson the scale of.one inch to the mile cover almost the whole of Great Britain. while some of these are old and lack precision, modern six-inch Geological Survey mapsalready exist for more than half the area.APPENDIX CCOMPENSATION WATERMost of the large water undertakers obtain supplies from impoundingreservoirs, constructed by building a dam across a stream at a suitable point where the retention of water will form a lake. The impounding reservoir is a means of storing the winter flood waters in a stream for use in the dry seasonswhen the natural flow in the stream would not yield sufficient water to meetthe requirements of the water undertaker. When water undertakers seek and obtain powers for the purpose, it is the practice in the special Acts authorising the works to, require them to send down the river or stream for the benefit ofthe riparian interests a daily, and usually regular, flow of water of a prescribedamount. Additional storage capacity has to be provided to meet this require-ment, and the expense of the works, almost invariably a costly undertaking, is substantially increased. Thus excessive obligations in the matter of compensationwater not only increase the cost of water to the consumers but may also materiallyimpair the value of the source.The present method of assessing compensation water was first evolved overeighty years ago when sufficient and accurate data were not available. Thenormal procedure is (a) to estimate the average annual rainfall over the catch-ment area for as long a period as possible, (b) to reduce this amount by one-fifth in order to estimate the rainfall which might be relied upon during a periodof three consecutive dry years, (c) to deduct from the remainder a number ofinches of rain (usually 14 ins. to 16 ins.) as the loss due to evaporation andabsorption in order to ascertain the &quot; reliable &quot; or &quot; available &quot; yield, and then(d) to divide this between the requirements of the public water supply and theriver in some fixed proportion, a common allocation being two parts to theformer and one to the latter.
It has long been felt that the present method is unsatisfactory, since little or no account is taken of the wide differences in the character oi streams. A&quot; flashy &quot; stream, where the flow in dry periods is low and the bulk of thetotal annual flow comes down the stream in. short periods of heavy flood, is of much less value to riparian interests&apos;than a &quot; steady &quot; stream where the flowin dry periods is comparatively high. Yet for the same total annual flow, the&quot; flashy &quot; stream would probably receive the same amount of compensationwater as the &quot; steady &quot; stream. Thus it frequently happens in practice thaton the present method of assessment water undertakers have to ensure sub-stantial quantities of water in a regular flow down a stream during long periods of the year when the stream in its natural state would be practically dry, andthis they have to do at their sole cost, i.e., at the cost of the water consumers.Further it is generally recognised that not sufficient account is taken of theextent to which streams are used for industrial and other purposes.The Second Report of the Central Advisory Water Committee recalls the factthat the problem of compensation water had been reviewed by the Joint Sejecjjjjji))Committee on Water Resources and Supplies in 1936. The Report continues -&quot; They [the Joint Committee] expressed the opinion in paragraph 33 of theirReport that although immediate steps should be taken to remedy the lack of statistical information and other reliable data, the following considerations mustapply both now and in the future, viz. :  (a) The amount of compensation water should be determined on the merits of each particular case.(6) In assessing the amount, regard should be had to (i) the character and flow of the stream;(ii) the extent to which it is used for industries, fisheries, etc.;(iii) the probability of future industrial development;(iv) the protection of the rights of riparian and other landowners;(v) the minimum proportion of the flow below which compensation ought not to be fixed in the interests both of public health and riparian owners.We are in full agreement with the Joint Committee on this question, and wesuggest that Parliament should be recommended to consider whether the time has not come for the existing practice to be revised, and whether Standing orders should not be amended to provide that regard should be had to the foregoingconsiderations when proposals entailing the assessment of compensation waterare under consideration. We suggest, also^ that it should be made clear thatthe interests of agriculture, land drainage, the prevention of pollution and navi-gation should be taken into account.&quot;The Government accept the views on compensation water expressed by thesetwo bodies and it is the intention to follow similar principles, so far as possible,in making Orders authorising water undertakers to take water from rivers orstreams.(33663)   Wt. 3864-6178   last   3/44  D.L.
