J264/INTERNATIONAL LABOUR  CONFERENCE,  PHILADELPHIA.Instructions to Delegates.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.AT its meeting in December last the Governing Body considered that the changein the whole war situation, though a hard and costly struggle may still lie ahead,and the beginning of concerted international action to deal with post-war problems,made it imperative that international consideration should be given to thesocial problems that will arise during the last period of the war and after the close of hostilities and that the International Labour Organisation should defineits own future policy, its programme and its place and status.2. It was decided, therefore, to convene a Session of the Conference andto place the following items on the Agenda : I. Future policy, programme and status of the International LabourOrganisation.II. Recommendations to the United Nations for present and post-warsocial policy.III. The organisation of employment in the transition from war to peace.IV. Social Security principles, and problems arising out of the war.V. Minimum standards of social policy in dependent territories.VI. Reports on the application of Conventions.VII. Directors&apos; Report.3. There was a considerable body of opinion, including the british employers&apos; and workers&apos; representatives, against a meeting being held before june but, in order to meet the&apos; strong representations of the United StatesGovernment that the meeting should be held in the United States in March, itwas decided to accept the earliest date permitted by the Constitution, 20th April.Among the considerations which had to be taken into account was the desirabilityof keeping the Conference clear of the Presidential election campaign.4. Having regard to the short time available for the preparation of papers and to the difficulties of communications it was not anticipated that the proposals to be considered by the Conference would cover more than the general principlesof policy in relation to such a comprehensive Agenda. The InternationalLabour Office, however, has circulated long reports on each item with detailed proposals covering almost the whole range of social policy and much that ispurely economic in character. Some of these reports have been received only within the last few days. It is proposed by the Office also, that its proposals shallbe adopted in the form of Recommendations (in one case in the form of a Con-vention).5. This creates a position of considerable difficulty. The normal procedure,even for decision by a single discussion, is the circulation to Governments bythe Office of a report on law and practice and a questionnaire; the preparationof drafts for Conventions or Recommendations by the Office on the basis of the replies of Governments to the questionnaire; and the communication of these reports and drafts to Governments so as to reach them four months before theopening of the Conference.6. The Office defends the waiving of this procedure in the following terms:  &quot; If the Conference formulates its decision in the form of one or moreRecommendations, Members, even if they approve them, are not rigidlybound to apply each and all of their provisions under the system of mutual[27271] b6j p-SECRET.

Having regard to the short time available for the preparation of papers and to the difficulties of communications it was not anticipated that the proposals to be considered by the Conference would cover more than the general principlesof policy in relation to such a comprehensive Agenda. The InternationalLabour Office, however, has circulated long reports on each item with detailed proposals covering almost the whole range of social policy and much that ispurely economic in character. Some of these reports have been received only within the last few days. It is proposed by the Office also, that its proposals shallbe adopted in the form of Recommendations (in one case in the form of a Con-vention).5. This creates a position of considerable difficulty. The normal procedure,even for decision by a single discussion, is the circulation to Governments bythe Office of a report on law and practice and a questionnaire; the preparationof drafts for Conventions or Recommendations by the Office on the basis of the replies of Governments to the questionnaire; and the communication of these reports and drafts to Governments so as to reach them four months before theopening of the Conference.6. The Office defends the waiving of this procedure in the following terms:  &quot; If the Conference formulates its decision in the form of one or moreRecommendations, Members, even if they approve them, are not rigidlybound to apply each and all of their provisions under the system of mutual[27271] b
supervision provided in Article 22 of the Constitution. Moreover, whileprocedure by means of the adoption of Eecommendations leaves thisflexibility of application to Members, it also protects the Organisation itselffrom the danger that in the absence of an adequate survey of practice andopinion Conventions might be adopted on the basis of insufficient informa-tion and subsequently fail to secure ratification.&quot;If these points are borne in mind, it will be seen that the departure from the normal procedure which the Governing Body proposes in order tomeet the needs of unprecedented circumstances has been carefully designedso as to enable the Conference to exercise its powers in the most effective way possible, while, at the same time leaving the Members the necessarylatitude in the application of the decisions at which the Conference may.arrive.&quot; It is, of course, for the Conference to decide whether it is prepared tofollow the suggested procedure. It appears reasonable, however, to assume that the Conference will share the view of the Governing Body that theInternational Labour Organisation would be failing in its duty if it did not,at the present juncture in the world&apos;s affairs, deal by an expedited procedurewith the important and urgent questions placed upon its Agenda.&quot;7. Recommendations, however, cannot be, and ought not to be, regarded solightly as is suggested. Under Article 19 of the Constitution a Recommendationmust be submitted to Governments &quot; with a view to effect being given to it by national legislation or otherwise.&quot; Further, each Government undertakes, withina year, and in no case later than eighteen months, to bring the Recommendationbefore the competent authority &quot; for the enactment of legislation or other action.&quot;Contrary, also, to their own statement that &quot; Members, even if they approve them,are not rigidly bound to apply each and all of their provisions,&quot; the Office hasinserted in the Draft Recommendations the hovel requirements that members should take the necessary steps to secure the effective application of the provisions and report to the Director at the earliest possible date particulars of the action taken to make the provisions effective. Such requirements would have the effect ofmaking the Recommendations more immediately binding than Conventions.8. As is indicated above, the long and detailed provisions included in theDraft Recommendations are not based on the replies of Governments to a questionnaire, as is usual, but are entirely the production of the staff of the Inter-national Labour Organisation. They include much that is contrary to decisionswe have already taken in regard to Health and Unemployment Insurance,Pensions and Workmen &apos;s Compensation, Demobilisation, &amp;c, and, in presentcircumstances, it would place us in great difficulty if the Government delegates had to register votes for or against these detailed proposals or enter into con-troversy with our own employers&apos; and workers&apos; representatives upon them.9. In these circumstances, I would suggest that the Delegates of HisMajesty&apos;s Government should oppose the proposal that Recommendations shouldbe adopted at this Conference and should state that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould welcome a full discussion of the various subjects with a view to providingfor Governments general principles upon which they may have a further chanceof expressing their views. In particular, the Conference should be regarded asan opportunity for employers&apos; and workers&apos; representatives to express their viewsfor the information of Governments. If this procedure is not accepted by amajority of the Conference I would suggest that the British Delegates should enterinto the discussions mainly for the purpose of indicating alternative proposalswithin the scope of Government decisions which have been published but shouldabstain from voting. It will be recognised that their position will be difficultbut they will doubtless be able to make a sufficiently constructive contribution tothe discussions to rebut the charge of following a negative policy which will doubtless be made in some quarters. I am satisfied, however, that any other policy would cause later embarrassment to His Majesty&apos;s Government and would be damaging to the authority of the International Labour Organisation.10. The Secretary of State for the Colonies feels that, if the policy suggested above is followed in respect of the draft Recommendation on minimum standards of social policy in dependent territories, our Delegates might be put in the positionof taking the lead in opposing a text, most of which in the course of Committeediscussion could probably be made acceptable, not in the sense of being 100 percent.&apos;applicable immediately and everywhere, but as the long-term Colonial labourcharter which it is clearly intended to be.  In his view that would have an unfor--&apos;&quot;-&apos;.;&apos;&apos;. ^: &apos;t: vjp
unfortunate political effect if, as seems to him likely, most other Governments concernedinstruct their Delegates to welcome the text at the outset and to press for amend-ment in the course of Committee discussion. He would prefer, therefore, thatthe United Kingdom Government Delegation should reiterate his statement in theHouse that the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the draft Recom-mendation is generally favourable; should stress the wide variety of Colonialconditions and should press for recognition of these differences by a Recommenda-tion which, while setting standards to be regarded as aims of policy for alldependent territories, puts on record the fact that the rate of progress in securing their effective application must vary with the stage of economic and other develop-ment reached in each territory, and ask those responsible Powers which approve the Recommendation to state in relation to each Article in the text (a) the territories in which it can be immediately applied; and(b) the territories in which the conditions necessarily precedent to itseffective application do not yet obtain.Given acceptance of that principle of &quot; gradualness,&quot; the Secretary of Stateconsiders that the Delegates should agree that the text of the draft Recommenda-tions be submitted to the usual process of discussion in Committee with a view totheir adoption as a Charter for future application as and when that becomespracticable in each territory. On this I would only say that certain of the amendments which are desired, for example, the substitution of an obligation to&quot;take into consideration &quot; for the obligation to put the provisions into effect,would be the subject of great controversy with the Workers&apos; Group, and would,in my opinion, open the way to more damaging criticism than the policy I havesuggested. In the case of all previous International Labour Organisation actionsin respect of Dependent Territories the proposals have first been examined by aCommittee of Experts, and have then been the subject of consideration by governments before Texts have been submitted to the Conference. It seems tome, therefore, that caution is necessary in regard to the formidable body of provisions which the Office has included in this Draft Recommendation. I shouldmuch prefer that, as in the case of the other Draft Recommendations, the policy,at this juncture, should be to secure the formulation of general principles withoutembodying them in a Recommendation involving obligations. The whole position may well be affected by other discussions which have to take place concerningdependent territories, and the presence of United States and Dominion repre-sentatives at this Conference will probably not make matters easy for our delegation if their instructions involve the casting of votes.11. The Draft Declaration of the Aims and Purposes of the InternationalLabour Organisation, which is an amplification of those in the existing Constitu-tion, has been discussed with the Foreign Office, and the Secretary of State andI are of opinion that the British Delegation should accept this, and should beauthorised to vote for any amendment which appears to be within the generalscope as defined.12. The Draft Resolution concerning the constitutional practice of theInternational Labour Organisation implies that the International LabourOrganisation should have autonomy as regards admission to membership and finance, including the fixing and collection of contributions. It appears to beintended to express the view of the Conference for the purpose of inclusion inany Peace Settlement. This has been discussed with the Treasury and theForeign Office, and it is suggested that the Delegates should indicate that thesematters must be considered in relation to the general discussion of worldmachinery, and they should endeavour to limit the action of the Conference todiscussing the contents of the Resolution. If a vote is taken they should abstain from voting. It is to be noted that the United States, Brazil and other countries,representing about 196 League units out of 616, are members only of theInternational Labour Organisation and therefore are in favour of its autonomy.13. The proposals of the Office in relation, to the item &quot; recommendations to the United Nations for Present and Post-Wa\r Social Policy,&quot; including by thespecial request of the State Department &quot; Social Policy in the territories of Axiscountries occupied by the forces of the United Nations &apos;&apos; present considerabledifficulty. It will be seen from the attached list of draft resolutions (in the pre-paration of which it is believed that the Office was in close contact with american authorities) that many of the subjects dealt with are closely connected with the[27271] &apos; b 2
informal discussions on Article VII of the Mutual Aid agreement and indicates a knowledge of those discussions. It is suggested thatthe Delegation should resist the incursion of the International LabourOrganisation into this field and should endeavour to secure the adoptionof a single resolution devoted to the proper objective of the InternationalLabour Organisation, which is to use its influence to securing that international and national measures shall be directed to ensuring full employment, social security and rising standards of living. The Delegation should make it clearthat they are not competent to discuss economic and monetary questions or toexpress views upon them. It is thought that pressure may come from the UnitedStates Delegation to secure the passing of these resolutions, including that whichwelcomes the initiative taken by the United States Treasury in putting forward a Preliminary Draft Outline of a Proposal for a Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment of the United and Associated Nations and it will be necessary forthe Delegation, within the above direction, to make such statements, if necessary,as will avoid any lack of appreciation of all initiatives which have been taken inthe interests of international welfare. The sections on the exploitation of oil resources and on international cartels, while given an I.L.O. connexion by the reference to working conditions and employment, are an indication of the source of much that is in this resolution.14. The proposed resolution concerning Social Provision in the peace settlement contains similar references to economic matters, including oil resources and international cartels. It is suggested that, having regard to the contentsand to the fact that only two copies of the report in which it is included had beenreceived on the 1st April, this resolution should be referred to Governments,without a vote being taken, but with a report on any observations made.15. In the same report are two other resolutions concerning Governmentand Administration by the United Nations of Germany and other TatalitaaiianCountries in Europe and Measures for the Protection of Transferred foreign workers and of Foreign Workers&apos; Organisations.As is stated above, the general subject covered by these resolutions was placedon the Agenda at the request of the United States State Department. In thepresent state of the discussions it seems to me to be impossible for the delegates to do more than suggest that the draft resolution and a report of any observa-tions made should be sent to the Governments concerned. The Workers&apos; Groupattach particular importance to this opportunity of expressing views on these subjects. It is to be noted that the Soviet Government will not be represented atthe Conference, although an indication of the desire of the Governing Body forthem to resume their place was conveyed to them.16. It is desirable, however, formally and publicly to dissociate HisMajesty&apos;s Government from a statement made by the Office in regard to the itemon the agenda covered by the above draft resolutions in a memorandum on theproceedings of the Governing Body meeting. The relevant extract is asfollows : &apos;&apos; The form of words adopted by the Governing Body for Item II differsin an important respect from that originally contemplated -namely, &apos;&apos; recom-mendations for post-war social policy.&quot; This change was made on theproposal of the representative of the Government of the United States and obtained the unanimous approval of the members of the Governing Body,including the representatives of the other United Nations who were present.It manifests the willingness of those members of the United Nations &quot;whoparticipated in the decision to submit their future internatiomal policies inthe social field to free discussion and decision by all members of the Inter-national Labour Organisation, including those countries which are not members of the United Nations. Naturally the United Nations represented on the Governing Body do not bind themselves, at this stage, any more thanthe other members of the International Labour Organisation, to accept ifaadvance any conclusions at w\Hich the Conference may arrive. The dhoMgemade in the wording of the Agenda is, however, a manifestation of  heirclear desire to apply the principles of democracy to the future ordering afthe world. While some of the recommendations which the Canfereno&amp; maymake will have a particular application to special situations with whidh theUnited Nations may have to deal, the general recommendations for post-warsocial policy will, of course, apply equally to all members of the InternationalLabour Organisation.
The part of the statement in italics is the Office view of the position and hasno basis in any statement made by any Government representative, except possiblythat of the United States Government representative, who is chairman of theGoverning body. He had wished the item to be described &apos;&apos; Present and Post-war policy of the United Nations,&quot; but the British Government representativesucceeded in getting this amended. Even so, the words &quot;and decision&quot; are entirely unfounded and particularly provocative. The statement is changed inthe Preface to the Report for the Conference and there is no reference to thedecision of United Nations&apos; Policy. Harm, however, has been done and thePortuguese Government has already indicated that it will not be represented atthe Conference, the stated reason clearly being this interpretation of the inclusionof this item on the Agenda. It is an indication of the difficult circumstances inwhich -this Conference is being held that the United States Secretary for Labourherself made direct representation to the Portuguese Minister on this statementof the Portuguese Government and that the International Labour Office conveyedher request to Great Britain to support her in asking the Portuguese Governmentto reconsider its decision. Doubtless other neutral Governments, members of theI.L.O. will find themselves in a similar position.17. Having regard to the volume and contents of the Draft Recommenda-tions and Resolutions, it is possible only to give the Delegates the general guidancewhich I have outlined above, but it will be recognised that much must be left totheir discretion in the course of proceedings in which employers&apos; and workers&apos;representatives have an equal place! If they are not under the obligation todiscuss draft recommendations with a view to their adoption, the danger of con-fli(5t with the British employers&apos; and workers&apos; representatives on items of domestic policy is reduced, although not completely removed.18. To sum up, I recommend that our delegates should be instructed to actas follows : (a) They should oppose the proposal that the Conference should adopt the series of recommendations put forward by the I.L.O. The conference should be regarded as an opportunity for employers&apos; and workers&apos;representatives to express their views for the information of Govern-ments (paragraph 9).(b) If this procedure is not accepted by the Conference, the British delegates should take part in the discussions, but abstain from voting(paragraph 9).Note. The Secretary of State for the Colonies does not favour the procedure at (a) and (b) as regards the draft Recommendationwhich deals tvith minimum standards of social policy in dependent territories (App. VII). He suggests an alternative procedure, about which I have grave doubts (paragraph 10).(c) The Draft Declaration of the Aims and Purposes of the I.L.O. (App. I)should be accepted, and the Delegation be authorised to vote for any amendment within the general scope as defined (paragraph 11).(d) Draft Resolution about the constitutional practice of the I.L.O. (App.II). The Delegation should say that these matters must be considered in relation to the general discussion of world machinery, and should try to limit action to discussion of the contents of the Resolution. Ifa vote is taken they should abstain (paragraph 12).(e) &quot;Recommendations to the United Nations for Present and Post-WarSocial Policy &quot; (App. III). The Delegation should resist the intrusionof the I.L.O. into this field, and should make it clear that they are notcompetent to discuss or express views upon economic and monetaryquestions. They should endeavour to secure the adoption of a singleresolution to the effect that the I.L.O. should use its influence to securethat international and national measures shall be directed to ensuringfull employment, social security and a rising standard of living.(/) The Resolution about Social Provisions in the Peace Settlement (App.IV) should be referred to the Governments, without a vote being taken,but with a report on any observations made (paragraph-14).(g) The two Resolutions about &quot;Government and Administration by theUnited Nations of Germany and other totalitarian countries inEurope&quot; (not reproduced) and &quot;Measures for the Protection of
transferred Foreign Workers and of Foreign Workers&apos; Organisa-tions&apos;&apos;   (not   reproduced)   should   be  sent   to   the   Governments&apos;(paragraph 15).(A) His Majesty&apos;s Government should formally and publicly dissociate itselffrom the statement made by the Office quoted in paragraph 16.19. Summaries of the contents of the Recommendations and Resolutions putforward by the I.L.O. are attached.E. B.13th April, 1944.SUMMARIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND RESOLUTIONS.APPENDIX I.Proposed Declaration concerning the Aims and Purposes of theInternational Labour Organisation.THE General Conference of the International Labour Organisation, meeting in its Twenty-sixth Session in Philadelphia, hereby adopts, this dayof in the year nineteen hundred and forty-four, the presentDeclaration of the aims and purposes of the International Labour Organisationand of the principles which should inspire the policy of its Members.The Conference reaffirms the fundamental principles on which the Organisa-tion is based and, in particular, that labour is not a commodity; that freedomof expression and of association are essential to sustained progress; that povertyanywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere, and that accordingly thewar against want, while it requires to be carried on with unrelenting vigourwithin each nation, equally requires continuous and concerted international effort in which the representatives of workers and employers, enjoying equal statuswith those of Governments, join with them in free discussion and democraticdecision with a view to the promotion of the common welfare.Believing that experience has fully demonstrated the truth of the statement in the Preamble to the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation thatlasting peace can be established only if it is based on social justice, the Conferenceaffirms that all human beings, irrespective of race, creed or sex, have the right to pursue both their material well-being and their spiritual development in conditions of freedom and dignity, of economic security and equal opportunity,that the attainment of the conditions in which this shall be possible mustconstitute the central aim of national and international policy, and that allpolicies and measures, in particular those of an economic and financial character,must be judged in this light and accepted only in so far as they may be held topromote and not to hinder the achievement of this fundamental objective.The Conference declares that it is accordingly a responsibility of theInternational Labour Organisation to scrutinise all international economic andfinancial policies and measures in the light of this fundamental objective, andthat, in discharging the tasks entrusted to it, the International Labour Organisa-tion may consider all relevant economic and financial factors and include in its decisions and recommendations any provisions which it considers appropriate.Among the matters to which urgent attention should be given by theInternational Labour Organisation, the Conference attaches special importanceto the following : The maintenance of full employment and the raising of standards ofliving.The employment of workers in the occupations in which they can havethe satisfaction of giving the fullest measure of their skill and attainmentsand make their greatest contribution to the common well-being and, as a means to the attainment of this end, the provision under adequate guarantees for all concerned of facilities for training and the transfer of labour,including migration for employment and settlement.The application of policies in regard to wages and earnings, hours andother conditions of work calculated to ensure a just share of the fruits of progress to all, and the assurance of a minimum living wage to all in need ofsuch, protection.
The effective recognition of the right of collective bargaining, theco-operation of management and labour in the continuous improvement of the productive efficiency, and the collaboration of workers and employers in the initiation and application of social and economic measures.The extension to the whole population of social security measuresproviding a basic income in case of inability to work or to obtain work, and providing comprehensive medical care.The provision of adequate protection for  he life and health of workersin all occupations.Provision for child welfare and maternity protection, and the provisionof adequate nutrition, housing and facilities for recreation and culture.The assurance of equality of educational and vocational opportunity.Confident that the fuller and broader utilisation of the world&apos;s productive resources necessary for the achievement of the objectives set forth in this declaration can be secured by effective international and national action,including, for example, measures to avoid severe economic .fluctuations, tomaintain consumption at a high level, to ensure the productive investment of allsavings, to promote the economic and social advancement of the less developedregions of the world, to assure greater stability in world prices of primary products, and to promote a high and steady volume of international trade, theConference pledges the&apos; full co-operation of the International Labour Organisa-tion with such international bodies as may be entrusted with a share of theresponsibility for this great task and for the promotion of the health, education and well-being of all peoples.The Conference affirms that the principles set forth in this Declaration are fully applicable to all peoples everywhere, and that, while the manner of their application must be determined with due regard to the stage of social andeconomic development reached by each people, their progressive application topeoples who are still dependent, as well as to those who have already achievedself-government, is a matter of concern to the whole civilised world.APPENDIX II.Proposed Resolution concerning the Constitutional Practice of theInternational Labour Organisation.The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation.Having been convened at Philadelphia by the Governing Body of the Inter-national Labour Office, and having met in its Twenty-sixth Session the20th April, 1944, andHaving decided that it is desirable -to state the constitutional practice of the International LabourOrganisation in respect of certain matters,to make provision for the establishment of close relationships of mutualco-operation between the International Labour Organisation and other international bodies,to assign certain powers and duties to the International Labour office in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 5 of Article 10 of theConstitution of the Organisation, andto invite the Members of the International Labour.

Proposed Resolution concerning Economic Policies for the Attainment&apos;of Social Objectives.Whereas the prospect of a complete victory of the United Nations makes it possible to prepare a better world order directed towards the achievement of thesocial objectives which these nations proclaimed in the Atlantic Charter in expressing their desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the object of securing for all improved labour standards, economic advancement and social security; andWhereas these objectives of the United Nations coincide with the basic principles of the International Labour Organisation, and the InternationalLabour Conference, meeting at New York in 1941, pledged the full collaboration of the International Labour Organisation in their implementation; andWhereas the International Labour Conference is called upon by Item II onthe agenda of the present session to make recommendations to the United nations for present and post-war social policy concerning more especially the measures required to be taken internationally and nationally to ensure full employment,social security and rising standards of living; andWhereas the initiative with regard to international policy lies with theUnited Nations at the present time, and it is desirable in order to attain the objectives referred to that all nations should pursue an appropriate national policy : - The Conference adopts the following resolutionI. International Policy.1. Believing that the relief of war-stricken peoples, repatriation ofprisoners and exiles and resumption of agricultural and industrial production are matters which will be of the utmost urgency immediately on the liberation of occupied countries and that on the successful handling of these problems thepossibility of achieving the long-range objectives of social and economic well-being will largely depend, &apos;The Conference welcomes the creation of the United Nations Relief and rehabilitation Administration, urges all States concerned to co-operate activelyin the achievement of the tasks entrusted to it and assures the Administration ofthe readiness of the International Labour Organisation to assist it in everyappropriate way.2. In view of the fact that for varying periods after the end of hostilitiesmany essential commodities and transport facilities will be in short supply, andthat international arrangements will be needed to ensure a fair allocation of available supplies and prevent excessive price movements.The Conference considers that the Governments of the United&apos; Nationsconcerned should arrange to continue in operation, for such periods as any seriousshortages may persist, the existing machinery of international co-ordination andcontrol subject to such modification, and in particular to such enlargement of the membership of the authorities concerned, as may contribute to the equitable and efficient operation of such machinery in the transition from war to peace.3. The Conference endorses the declaration of the United nations conference on Food and Agriculture held in May 1943, that while the primary responsibility lies with each nation for seeing that its own people have the foodneeded for life and health, each nation can fully achieve this goal only if allco-operate in appropriate international action, and urges the setting up of apermanent international organisation, as recommended by the Conference on food and Agriculture, to raise the level of nutrition and improve the efficiency ofagricultural production and distribution.4. Recognising that a satisfactory international monetary system is essentialto the full development of mutually advantageous economic relations between nations, and consequently to the raising of standards of living.The Conference attaches great importance to the establishment at theearliest possible moment of effective international machinery for settling balances,[27271] &apos; c 2
arising out of international trade and other transactions and for maintainingstability in rates of exchange, notes with satisfaction that the Governments of theUnited Nations are giving careful attention to this matter and urges that they include in any agreement establishing such machinery a provision requiring theauthorities responsible for its application to have regard in framing and applyingtheir policies to the effect of their decisions on employment and living standards.5. Noting that imports of capital will be. needed for reconstruction, develop-ment and the raising of living standards in many countries, and believing thatthe provision of such capital will contribute to the maintenance of full employmentin the lending countries,The Conference: (a) Considers that appropriate international machinery should be establishedforthwith for the purpose of promoting such international movements of capital;(b) accordingly welcomes the initiative taken by the United States treasury in putting forward a Preliminary Draft Outline of a Proposal for a Bank for reconstruction and Development of the United and Associated Nations, andnotes with satisfaction that the powers and discretion to be vested in the proposedBank would be such as to enable it to make capital available for developmentalpurposes to all countries including those which have at once the greatest need of capital and the greatest difficulty in securing it;(c) considers that the promotion of full employment and higher living standards should be regarded as a primary objective of any such international development bank, and that the terms of all contracts for deveiopment worksfinanced by loans guaranteed, participated in or made by it should includeappropriate provisions regarding the welfare and working conditions of thelabour employed; and(d) affirms the readiness of the International Labour Organisation to renderevery assistance in its power in the framing and application of such provisions and in the achievement of the general objectives of the proposed bank.6. Recognising the great contribution which the international exchange ofgoods and services can make to higher living standards,- \.The Conference : (a) Believes that the measures proposed in the foregoing paragraphs forthe promotion of exchange stabilisation and international lending will contribute to the expansion of international trade, but considers that the United nations should also take vigorous action to promote such expansion directly by the elimination of all forms of discriminatory treatment in international commerce and the reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers;(b) considers that all countries, creditor as well as debtor, should adapt their commercial policy in such a way as to enable them to trade freely with one another and to settle all obligations arising out of international transactions; and(c) considers that the United Nations should initiate measures to facilitate the co-ordination through appropriate international machinery of the commercialpolicies of all countries for the purpose of promoting a steady expansion in world trade on a multilateral basis.7. In order to lay the foundation for rising levels of consumptionthroughout the world and at the same time to ensure more stable and adequateincomes to those primary producers whose services are needed for the productionof essential raw materials and food-stuffs,The Conference considers that the United Nations should initiateconcerted action to ensure the constant availability to all purchasers of adequate supplies of such commodities at prices which give a reasonable return to the efficient producer, and are held sufficiently stable to afford protection againstmajor short-term fluctuations in supply or demand; and that such international arrangements should provide for (a) adequate representation of consumers aswell as producers in all authorities responsible, for the determination and application of policy, and (b) the assurance to all workers engaged in theproduction of the commodities concerned of fair remuneration, satisfactoryworking conditions and adequate social security protection.8. In view of the important role that oil is destined to play in post-war reconstruction, and in view of the fact that the world&apos;s oil resources aredistributed unequally among the different countries,
270-2-3-4The Conference considers that the United Nations should instituteinternational arrangements for the development, conservation and equitable distribution of the world&apos;s oil resources in the interests of all peoples on a basisdesigned to avoid international friction, to permit an optimum rate of produc-tion, and to ensure that the oil so produced is made available to all purchasers on terms which, while safeguarding fully the interests of consumers, will affordfair compensation to producing countries for the loss of a wasting asset, and will facilitate the attainment by the peoples of those countries of standards of social and economic well-being having a reasonable relation to the value of their contribution to the world&apos;s economy.9. Believing that migratory movements may play an important part in thedevelopment of a dynamic economy, and that disorderly international migrationmay create economic and social dislocation in the countries concerned and involve serious individual hardship for the migrants themselves, while desirablemigratory movements are often hampered by technical and financial difficultieswhich can be overcome only through international co-operation,The Conference considers that the United Nations should initiatemeasures to facilitate, by the provision of necessary technical and financialassistance, regulated migration of labour and settlers in accordance with theeconomic development of the various countries, under adequate guarantees forall concerned.10. Noting that marked differences of opinion exist with regard to theadvantages and disadvantages of international industrial agreements concerningsuch matters as patent rights, the control of production and the allocation of markets, but believing that such agreements may have widespread repercussions on production, prices and standards of living,The Conference 1(a) considers that the full searchlight of publicity should be directed on theexistence and operation of such agreements; and(b) urges the United Nations, as a first step in this direction, to initiatearrangements for the registration of all such agreements by, and the submission of full information concerning their operation to, an appropriate international authority and for the making and publication of periodical reports on the basisof this information.II. National Policy.11. Governments and employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations should prepare and apply national policies aiming at full employment, social security and risingstandards of living, simultaneously with the consideration of the internationalmeasures referred to in the preceding paragraphs.12. In view of the important structural changes which have occurred inmany countries during the war, such as, for example, the abnormal growth ofcertain industries and their concentration in certain areas, plans should be made immediately for the rapid and orderly conversion of the various nationaleconomies from wartime to peacetime requirements, and, in particular, fordealing with all questions arising out of the cancellation and termination of contracts for war materials, including the payment to contractors as speedily aspossible of the sums due to them by Governments.13. Because of the abnormal price relationships that have developed inmany countries, the fact that both capital goods and consumers&apos; goods will be in short supply for some time after the end of the war, and the big potential demandfor such goods which, if not controlled, might lead to a price inflation followedby collapse and widespread unemployment, Governments should, so long asshortages exist, maintain such financial and economic controls -for example,price and exchange controls and rationing as may be necessary to preventinflation, and should avoid such precipitate reductions in taxation as might leadto inflation.     e14. The continual improvement of the productive efficiency of the economic system should be actively promoted at all times; -(a) by encouraging enterprise and technological progress and by facilitating the development of industries in which there is an expandingdemand; and -
(6) by encouraging the transfer of productive resources from declining toexpanding industries and in general from less attractive to more attractive employments by such measures as the provision of credit and technical advice to employers, and of facilities for the trainingor retraining of workers and an employment service adequate toensure their placement as rapidly and satisfactorily as possible.15. All appropriate measures should be taken to maintain a high andsteady level of economic activity and employment, in particular by (a) sustaining the volume of demand for consumers&apos; goods by such methodsas an adequate income security system; and(b) ensuring the productive investment of all savings by -(i) measures to encourage private investment and as far as possibleto stabilise the rate at which it takes place;- (ii) the organisation and financing of public investment in such a way as to maintain stability in total investment at a level adequate to ensure full employment, in particular by the timing of allworks undertaken or financed by public authorities in such away as to offset fluctuations in private investment and the financing of such works by borrowing in periods of depressionin accordance with the Public Works (National Planning)Recommendation, 1937.APPENDIX IV.Proposed Resolution concerning Social Provisions in the peace settlement.Preamble.Whereas the Conference is called upon by Item II on the Agenda of itspresent Session to make recommendations to the United Nations for presentand post-war social policy, and more particularly concerning the socialprovisions to be inscribed in the various general or special treaties or agreements to which the United Nations will jointly or severally become parties; andWhereas it is desirable that such treaties and agreements shoulid makeappropriate provision for the advancement of the social principles to which theUnited Nations stand committed;I.The Conference adopts the following Resolution :  1.
