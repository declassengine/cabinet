THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet,   March 1944.SECRET. Copy No,W.P. (44) 175.29th March, 1944.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 1944 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES and mandated TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.1. Mr..Mackenzie King, in his opening statement at the new session of theCanadian Parliament began with an attack on Mr. Bracken, the leader of the progressive Conservative Party, for his failure to take his seat in the House ofCommons and offered the Government^ full assistance in facilitating his entrance to the House. The Prime Minister has since then had several sharp exchangeswith the Progressive Conservative party leader in the House. Mr. King&apos;s state-ment also dealt with the prospect of a general election; he announced that theGovernment had no desire to call an election while the war was on, but he declaredequally that he did not favour the House prolonging its life beyond the normalterm, which is due to expire next year. In fact, he has left the impression thatthe Government may call a &quot; snap &quot; election at any moment that best suits themand the political temperature has, as a result, risen considerably.2. A Dominion Labour Code incorporating the suggestions, objections and changes advanced by Dominion authorities, Provincial Governments and represen-tatives of both Employers and Labour in consultations lasting some months came into effect on the 18th February. Its main points, as announced by the Ministerof Labour, are as follows : (1) The establishment of a Wartime Labour Relations Board comprising a chairman, vice-chairman and not more than eight members.(2) The certification by the Board of bargaining agencies representing themajority of employees in affected industries.(3) Compulsory negotiation between employers and certified bargainingagencies.(4) Conciliation procedure if negotiations for an agreement fail.(5) Prohibition of strikes during the selection of a bargaining agency,negotiation of an agreement, conciliation proceedings if necessary, andthe life of the agreement after it is adopted.(6) A definition of unfair practices by employers, employees and unions.3. The Presidents of the Trades and Labour Congress and of the CanadianCongress of Labour have endorsed the Code. The Code does not cover certainnon-war industries and businesses but provides that it can be extended to cover allindustry through non-current Provincial legislation.4. Mr. Vincent Massey, the Canadian High Commissioner in London, hasbeen in Ottawa for consultations with the Prime Minister and officials of theDepartment of External Affairs.
Service Activities.5. A new British-built Destroyer, Qu&apos;appelle, has been commissioned forthe Royal Canadian Navy.6. H.M.C. Destroyers Athabaskon, Haida and Iroquois formed part of an escort to ships of the Home Fleet in an operation against shipping in tjheNorwegian Leads on the 11th. H.M.C. Frigate Waskesiu rammed and sank aU-boat 500 miles north of the Azores on the 24th; some prisoners were picked up.7. Four Divisions of Canadian minesweepers (16 ships) have sailed from canada to the United Kingdom to be administered and operated under UnitedKingdom Naval Command.8. In Italy bad and wintry&apos; weather persisted during most of the month and hampered operations by the Canadian troops in the 8th Army sector;activity was confined to patrolling with the exception of a small advance towardsTollo by a Canadian Brigade on the 24th.9. Bomber Squadrons of the R.C.A.F. were active during the month and bombed Berlin four times, Schweinfurt twice, . Augsburg twice, Leipzig,Frankfurt and Stuttgart once each.   59 bombers were reported missing.10. Fighter groups were again comparatively quiet owing to squadronsre-equipping and carrying out extensive training programmes. Eight german aircraft were destroyed and six damaged. Night-fighter squadrons claimseven destroyed and two damaged. Intruders had a successful month and destroyed 23 German aircraft.11. Coastal squadrons sighted and attacked two submarines. a convoy, consisting of a large merchant vessel with three smaller escorts wassighted by Beaufighters of 404 squadron and attacked; one ship was seen to blowup and the remainder was set on fire and left burning in a badly damagedcondition.12. Six more squadrons have recently arrived from Canada; three aretraining as Ground-attack Squadrons and the other three as Fighter-Squadrons;none of them are yet operational. -   &apos;Economic.13. Meat rationing was introduced in Canada in May 1943 mainly toensure an equitable distribution in Canada while creating an increased export-able surplus to meet urgent and essential requirements of the United Kingdom.There have, however, been unusually heavy marketings of all types of livestockduring the recent months (and it is expected that these will continue for thenext two or three months), with the result that storage and transportationfacilities have become acutely congested. - Since there is at present no reservecold storage space, and since there are also limitations on physical capacity tomove the meat to sea-board and overseas, the Canadian Government decided to suspend meat rationing (including the meatless Tuesday) as from the1st March, the suspension to continue until the congestion, both in storage and transportation, is cleared up. The official Canadian announcement stated thatthe Government is fully determined that essential requirements of the UnitedKingdom and overseas Forces shall be met and intend, therefore, that meatrationing shall be resumed as soon as such a course will be helpful.AUSTRALIA.14. The United Australia Party has withdrawn its representatives,Mr. Menzies, Mr. Hughes and Mr. Spender, from the Advisory War Council.It is understood that Mr. Hughes and Mr. Spender are reconsidering their position. Meanwhile, the Country Party, under the leadership of Mr. Fadden,will continue to be represented on the Council.15. An amendment designed to reduce to a large extent the powers sought by the Commonwealth Government under the Constitution Alteration (Post-war reconstruction) Bill was moved by Mr. Menzies in the House of representatives on the 23rd February. The main points put forward by Mr. Menzies were thatthe Government should not have the power to engage in civil production in industry and no amendment of the Constitution should be approved which
authorised the socialisation of industry, the undue centralisation of administra-tion, or the maintenance of laws which unnecessarily interfere with the liberty of citizens to choose their own means of living and to exercise their rights asfree people. Mr. Spender opposed. Mr. Menzies&apos;s amendment, and supported the Bill, provided that the Government promised to implement two safeguards (1) the prevention of the delegation of legislative power by the executive to persons who are not responsible to the people; and(2) the preservation of freedom of speech and the right to criticise in writingand broadcasting.16. Mr. John Lienhop, Minister of Public Works in the Victorian Cabinet,has been appointed Agent-General for Victoria in London, and will take up hisnew appointment in November. He will succeed Sir Louis Bussau, who has beenAgent-General since April 1938.17. The stoppages in the coal mines of New South Wales have caused grave concern to the Commonwealth Government. With the object of increasing thecoal output Mr. Curtin introduced a Bill in tJhe House of Representatives on the18th February conferring far-reaching powers on the Coal Commission. The newpowers include authority to operate any mine, subject to compensation to an owner suffering consequential loss or damage. When a controlled mine makesmore than average output, the excess must be paid to the credit of the Commission,and will be applied to the advancement of the industry, including the social welfare of employees. Under the powers conferred upon the Government bythe Act which was subsequently passed, the Australian Coal Commissioner hasassumed control of the Coalcliffe mine, conditions at which led to the generalstoppage in the southern coal mines of New South Wales.Service Activities.18. H.M.A. Mine-sweepers Launceston and Ipswich, in company with .M.I.S. Jumna, probably sank a U-boat off Vizagapatam on the 11th.19. The Australian Governments policy of releasing 22,000 men from thearmy to rural industry by June 1944 is going forward slightly ahead of schedule.Total discharges approved from the 1st November, 1943, to the 19th February,1944, are 8,907.20. Arrangements have been made for a party of Canadian Officers to beattached to the Australian Military Forces for about six months in order to gain experience in jungle warfare in the South-West Pacific area. It is proposedthat at the end of their training these officers should return to the CanadianMilitary Forces as instructors in jungle warfare.21. The total of United States forces in South-West Pacific area, includingArmy and Air Corps at the end of February, was 363,914.NEW ZEALAND.22. Opening the first session of the 27th Parliament of the Dominion on the23rd February the Governor-General gave a lengthy review of the war situation.In the course of his speech he announced that the question of the adoption of theStatute of Westminster would be placed before Parliament during the coming session, and stated that this step would remove doubt in the eyes of foreign powers regarding the status of New Zealand, and would have the practical effectof removing some of the existing legal and administrative difficulties, both in NewZealand and the United Kingdom.23. The Governor-General&apos;s speech promised that consideration would begiven to the introduction of pay-as-you-earn taxation; to the question of the rehabilitation of ex-Service men and women, including Maoris; the extensionof the housing programme, and the increase of agricultural production. The onlylegislation specifically foreshadowed was a Bill to provide for annual holidayswith pay for all workers and another Bill to extend the War Da-mages Act to damage caused by earthquake.
24. There has been some criticism of the extension of the man-powerregistration provisions to women of the 31 to 40 age group. Reporting that only6,000 out of 100,000 women under 31 who had previously registered had been directed to essential work, the newspapers expressed the view that more use shouldbe made of- the lower age groups before drawing on the older women.25. The extension of railway travel restrictions to the whole of NewZealand on account of the shortage of coal has evoked strong criticism ofabsenteeism among miners and the frequency of short strikes.Service Activities.26. The New Zealand Corps, under the command of Lieutenant-general sir B. C. Freyberg, V.C., consisting of 2nd New Zealand Division and 4th indian division, was formed in Italy towards the beginning of the month; the78th Division has since been added to this Corps. New Zealand units again oameinto the line in the Cassino sector early in the month, and on the 18th took part with Indian troops in an attack against the Cassino defences. An advance on theMonastery feature made some ground, but was halted by determined counterattacks and heavy artillery fire. A little further south, after crossing the RiverRapido, New Zealand troops occupied the railway station, but were forced backafter holding the objective for a day. Later, on the 24th, the 78th Division took the sector along the River Rapido south of Cassino and the New Zealanders thenmoved round to the north of the town.27. Norfolk Island. Proposals for a reduction in the strength of thegarrison have been put into effect. The main body, numbering 16 officers and410 other ranks, has already returned to New Zealand.28. Tonga. Plans for reducing the garrison are in hand. Already115 officers and 774 men have returned to New Zealand.29. In order to reduce the- diversity of aircraft types with the object ofsimplifying training and maintenance, the R.N.Z.A.F. programme for 1944 isnow to be fixed at a total operational strength of 6 Bomber ReconnaissanceSquadrons (Venturas P.V. 1), 10 Fighter Squadrons (Corsairs FAIL),2^ Squadrons of Catalina Flying Boats P.B.2.B. and one Transport Squadron ofDouglas C. 47.Economic.30. Meat rationing was introduced in New Zealand on the 6th March, withthe object of helping to secure the maintenance of supplies for the UnitedKingdom and for the United States Forces in the area. The basis is moneyvalue varying according to the season from Is. 9d. to 2s. a week, this representing,an average ration of 2-^ lbs. a week. Children over six months and under five will receive half ration; some heavy manual labourers one and a half ration. Five 3d.coupons and one variable value coupon will be released each week, and will have a currency of two weeks. There is no consumer registration and coupons can be used at any butcher. Persons having a meat meal at a restaurant or hotel surrenderone 3d. coupon. Canned meats, sausages, offals, poultry, rabbit, bacon, ham andfish are unrationed, but in many cases are in short supply; consumption ceilingswill be placed on some of these. Price fixation and some measure of control willprobably be found necessary to ensure equal distribution. It is estimated that the saving in a full year will amount to at least 50,000 tons of meat.SOUTH AFRICA.31. General Smuts stated in Parliament on the 28th February that it waspossible that the present Session of Parliament would finish either at the endof April or at the beginning of May. The only important government measures to be introduced which were not already on the order paper were the&quot;usual Financial Measures Bill, dealing with the re-employment of volunteersin the Civil Service, and a Bill to provide for the establishment of a StandardsBureau. The question of Social Security has already been referred to a SelectCommittee and the implication of General Smuts&apos;s statement is that no social security legislation beyond a small increase in pensions provided for in the.Budget will be introduced this Session.
32. On the 21st February the House of Representatives discussed a motionby the Nationalist Opposition that all children should be educated in their&apos;Mother tongue in all stages of their school careers but &quot;that a satisfactorystandard in the &quot;other language&quot; should be demanded for school-leavingcertificates. This would mean the preservation of the present system of singlemedium schools. Replying to the Debate, General Smuts said that the wholeobject of the act of union was the amalgamation of the two races into one nation.To maintain the system of single medium schools which arose out of the politicalstrife after the last war would be to perpetuate the racial divisions of thecountry. He proposed, therefore, that while all children should be educatedin their Home tongue in the early stages, the use of the other language shouldbe gradually introduced, not only as a subject, but as a medium of instruction,and that such changes should be made in the training of teachers as wouldmake the ideals of bilingualism and national unity in the schools more effective.General Smuts explained that this would be applied to both English-speakingand Afrikaans-speaking schools with absolute fairness.Economic.33. The Minister of Agriculture and Forestry has appointed Mr. E. R.Keegan as Controller of Food with effect from the 21st January.34. Mr. J. G. N. Strauss, M.P. for Germiston, has been appointed Ministerof Agriculture and Forestry in succession to the late Colonel W. R Collins.EIRE.35. In a speech on the 26th February Mr. de Valera raised again thequestion of Eire&apos;s neutrality. &quot;The policy of neutrality,&quot; he said, &quot; is nota policy of any one party. Certain propagandists in certain countries abroad,for their own special reasons, are trying to make it appear that neutrality ismy personal policy or, at most, only that of our Government. You all know that is untrue. You all know that for good and sufficient reasons neutralityis the policy of the whole people; that it is the policy of every party and everyorganisation; that, in fact, at the recent general election not a single individual or party put forward as a policy that we should enter the war, except in self-defence and if we were attacked. That was a general election of which anopponent of the Government had said that it was the freest general election everconducted in any democratic country in the world. There could be no doubtthat neutrality was the policy of the whole people, democratically adopted.&quot;36. Following his recent declaration, recorded in last month&apos;s Report, thathis party (Fine Gael) stood unequivocally for membership of the British Common-wealth, General Mulcahy emphasised in a speech early in February that Eirehad not severed her connection with the Commonwealth. He also emphasised the &apos;&apos; desirability in the national interest (of Eire) not only of remaining amember of the Commonwealth, but of taking Snore active steps as soon aspracticable for closer co-operation by us (Eire) with the other members of theCommonwealth in those pressing matters which would affect our mutual interestin the post-war world.&quot; -37. Stating that some people in Northern Ireland were suggesting, if notdemanding, vindictive treatment for Eire because of her neutrality, CardinalMacRory, in his Lenten Pastoral, asks : &quot;I wonder what those people expectEire to do % Did they want her to show gratitude when she could not possiblyfeel it ? Did they want her to show gratitude for Partition, which only a fewyears previously had unjustly cut into two portions, against its will, one ofthe oldest nations in Europe1? The fact is that Eire deserves credit in thecircumstances for not having allied herself with the Axis nations and offeredthem hospitality and assistance. I am an old man and may not be spared tosee the end of the war, but I should like to be able to hope, before I die, thatafter the post-war peace, my countrymen of every creed and class will be livingtogether in genuine brotherhood, all proud of their dear Motherland. Not theleast of the reasons why I want to see Partition ended is that I believe that inan Ireland united and free those senseless quarrels of Orangemen and Catholics,which are in reality a disgrace to religion&apos;, would wholly and speedily disappearfor ever. ,  ,
38. Eeplying to questions in the Dail on the 17th February regarding therecent parachute landings in Eire by two men, who have since been detained,Mr. de Valera replied that two young men, who had been working in the channel islands when the German Forces occupied those islands, were dropped byparachute in County Clare, on the 16th December and the 19th December, andwere arrested without delay and interned. In reply to further questionsMr. de Valera said that the authorities were trying to get as much informationas possible as to why the men were dropped. The question whether they werespies was being examined. 139. Mr. de Valera, speaking at a Gaelic revival meeting at Drogheda onthe 18th February, said that many people were not satisfied with the resultsof the Gaelic revival efforts. The aim was to teach the language not merely as an academic subject but as the spoken tongue. The value of the work donein the schools was lost to a certain extent because the children did not have theopportunity or did not make the opportunity to speak it. The restorationcould not be accomplished without the conscious effort of the whole of the people.Help from the Government, Mr. de Valera said, would always be available, butthe Government could not by its own action restore the language.At the same meeting, General Mulcahy said that the plans that were adopted in 1922 for the fostering of the Irish language and for the improve-ment of education were in no way sacrosanct. The last report of theDepartment of Education on the position of Irish in primary schools called forimmediate attention. Monseigneur Quinn, who presided, said that the results ofthe Irish teaching had been somewhat disappointing. In every day life an Irishcultural outlook was far from obvious.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.40. The chief political event of the month was the Viceroy&apos;s address tothe Legislature on the 17th February. The speech revealed no sensational changeof policy on the Indian political problem; its keynote indeed was the Viceroy&apos;sanxiety to divert political thought from unprofitable discussion into constructivechannels in a spirit of sympathy and understanding. In hardly any quarters inIndia have the subsequent reactions been immediately favourable! Moslem opinionresented the Viceroy&apos;s emphasis on the geographical unity of India; Hindusresented the refusal to release the Congress leaders without some sign of willing-ness on their part to co-operate. But the sober realism of the speech will nodoubt have penetrated beneath the surface of Indian opinion. The Viceroyreaffirmed the principles of the Cripps Offer and stressed the importance of a,preliminary examination of the constitutional problem by an authoritative bodyof Indians.41. Mrs. Gandhi died of heart trouble late in February. She had been detained with her husband in August 1942 and was still in detention at the timeof her death, but was receiving every medical care and comfort. She had taken no prominent part in Indian politics; her arrest in 1942 was made inevitablebecause of her declared intention to address public meetings after her husband&apos;sarrest.Foreign and Frontier Relations.42. Afghanistan. There is increasing evidence of Afghan anxiety toco-operate whole-heartedly with us and to rely equally on the Americans and ourselves for assistance. This tendency was strengthened by a goodwill visit fromGeneral Hurley last month as the personal representative of President Roosevelt.This visit had an excellent effect and General Hurley particularly tried to assure the Afghan Government in regard to the future intentions of Russia. Internallythe situation in the Southern Province was disturbed and the Government^efforts to assert control over this Province and the Eastern Province have so farmet with scanty success. The economic situation remained unchanged and theoperation of price control was tolerably successful. The Prime Minister made good work towards recovery and hoped to be able to resume work in the spring.Ill
43. The Afghan Government presssd for our agreement to their releasingAsal Mir, one of the three persons whose arrest we especially asked for last autumn in connection with Axis intrigues. They represented that his continued detention was causing them much embarrassment with the tribal leaders and inview of the improvement in our relations with the Afghan Government HisMajesty&apos;s Minister was authorised to agree to the release on condition that satis-factory security was taken by the Afghan Government to ensure Asal Mir&apos;sgood behaviour.44. Rassmus, the German Commercial Attache, left Kabul for India inthe middle of the month whence he will be repatriated under safe conduct. TheGerman Legation is now left with only the Minister, the Surgeon, and subordinatestaff.45. North-West Frontier Province. In Waziristan there was some localtrouble which made it necessary to take punitive air action in several areas. TheFaqir of Ipi emerged from his fastness on the Afghan border and moved todifficult country in the heart of Waziristan where he renewed his efforts to reconcile the two major tribes of the country in the hope of uniting them against government. It is doubtful whether his influence is now sufficient to overcome the deep-seated hostility which exists between these tribes. Elsewhere thefrontier situation remained quiet.46. Nepal. The Maharaja has shown some annoyance at our refusal toallow His Majesty&apos;s Minister to accept a Nepalese decoration and has also raisedonce more the old question of the status of the British Minister in Katmanduwhom he considers to be treated as on a par with a second-class resident in India.He maintains that this is an indication of the low value placed by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on the importance of Nepal and contrasts it unfavourably with thehigher pay and status granted to His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Kabul.47. Jemadar Gaje Ghale, V.C., arrived at Katmandu on the 24th February.The Maharaja received him and presented him with the medal of the Nepal Star.48. Tibet. The Tibetan Government and the Maharaja of Bhutan againasked that Sir Basil Gould, the Political Officer in Sikkim, should be granted afurther extension in his present post. Sir Basil Gould&apos;s personal influence withthe Tibetans is a valuable asset at this time and an extension has been approved.- Financial.49.   Indian Budget;-*The Budget for 1944-45 was introduced in the Legis-lative Assembly on the 29th February.  The main figures follows :-Revised Estimate, Budget,1943-44. 1944-45.  millions.          -   millions.Revenue          ......&apos;    ...      190-6 213-8Expenditure charged to Revenue Civil        63-3 65 0Defence  197-6         260-9       207-5 272-5Deficit 70-3 58-7** On the basis of existing taxation.50. Income Tax and Corporation Tax in 1943-44 are expected to yield 11-3 millions and  15-6 millions respectively more than was estimated In theBudget fort that year. In 1944-45, improvements of  11-6 millions and  15-4millions, respectively, over the Revised Estimates for 1943-44 are expected.Out of the proceeds of Income Tax the Provinces will receive  14-6 millions in 1943-44 and  17-8 millions in 1944-45, on the basis of the estimated figures.51. Railways. The estimated contributions to general revenues are  24^millions in 1943-44 and  23^ millions in 1944-45.As an anti-inflationary measure it is proposed to raise passenger fares in1944^45 by 25 per cent. The additional.revenue, estimated at  7^ millions, is tobe earmarked for post-war amenities for lower class passengers.52. Defence Expenditure in the revised estimates for 1943-44 is  60^-millioris higher than in the budget for that year.   This large increase is due to
the rise in the price level of stores, to the grant of improved scales of rations to indian troops, to the transfer to revenue account of certain expenditure held insuspense, and to additional services and supplies to the United States onreciprocal aid.The increase ift 1944-45 is broadly due to the same considerations.The setting up of the South-East Asia Command has not, of itself, affectedIndian defence expenditure.Defence capital expenditure is put at  28f millions in 1943-44 and 181 millions in 1944-45.53. Grants to Provinces. The estimates include  2^ millions in 1943-44and  lij million in 1944-45 for special grants to Bengal, in view of its present financial difficulties.54. Deficit. The estimated deficit of  58f millions in 1944-45 will be metto the extent of about  I7f millions by additional taxation, leaving an uncovereddeficit of  41 millions.55. New Direct Taxation. No changes are proposed in the tax on incomesup to  750 per annum, but above this level and up to  1,125 the rate of tax willbe increased by 2 pies in the rupee (^2\d. in the  ) and, on any balance of incomeabove  1,125, by 4 pies in the rupee ^5d. in the  ). Super-tax on portions of income between  2,625 and  15,000 will be raised by ^ anna in the rupee (-7%d.in the  ). Corporation tax will be increased by 1 anna in the rupee (^ls. 3d. inthe  ), but a corresponding rebate will be given on such of a company&apos;s total income as is not distributed in dividends other than at a fixed rate. these changes are estimated to produce an additional  6f millions.The small tax that that been levied on incomes between  112 10s. and  150will be abolished. The loss of revenue will be small (about  187,000) and much needed staff will be released for other duties.56. New Indirect Taxation. The excise duty on Tobacco, first imposed inMarch 1943, is to be doubled, to produce  7-j millions.The emergency surcharge of 20 per cent, on customs duties will continue for afurther year, while on imported Tobacco and Spirits the surcharge will be raised to 50 per cent., to produce  f million.New Excise duties are to be imposed on Betel-nuts, Coffee, and Tea at 2 annas(2^d.) a pound.   These should yield  3 millions.57. Anti-inflationary measures.- The budget includes the following measures connected with taxation, which are designed to absorb purchasingpower &apos;(a) a pay-as-you-earn scheme for income tax under which advance payments of tax will be collected quarterly, such advance payments carrying2 per cent, interest until they are set off against regular assessments;(b) compulsory deposit of the balance of excess profits after payment ofE.P.T. at 66f per cent, and of income tax and super-tax on 33-J percent., thus immobilising 100 per cent, of excess profits; and(c) the 25 per cent, increase in railway passenger fares, mentioned above.These measures will, it is estimated, bring in about  37-J millions (non-recurring) under (a),  5^ millions (refundable after the war) under (b), and 7-^-9 millions (earmarked for post-war improvements) under (c), a total of over 50 millions.The total anti-inflationary effect of all the budgetary changes is expected tobe about  69 millions. &quot;   ,Economic and Health.58. Cotton piece-goods and yarn. India, in spite of the calls&apos; made on herproductive capacity by military requirements, arranged through the eastern group Supply Council, and by her own domestic needs, continues to provide anexportable surplus of considerable dimensions for the benefit of the outside world,where such goods are in exceedingly short supply. Until the latter part of 1943&apos;the distribution of this surplus was arranged by informal consultations with theBoard of Trade to ensure that it and the United Kingdom surplus would be put to the best possible use. Recently the Ministry of Production have taken thisplanning under their wing with a view to fitting it into the combined worldscheme controlled by C.P.R.B. at Washington.
The surplus for 1943 amounted to 60,000 tons and the Government of india have agreed to maintain it at this rate during the first half of 1944. The estimate for military requirements stands at the same figure and these two totals represent20 per cent, of India&apos;s estimated total production.Prices had risen to a very high level during 1942 and in the following year the Government of India not only introduced a price control scheme to coverdomestic sales but arranged for the manufacture of &apos;&apos; standard cloth &apos;&apos; for internaldistribution. Attention is now being given to the extension of price control tothe external market.59. Coal. There has been a seasonal improvement in raisings, although theyhave not yet reached the average target figure of 2,137,000 tons per month, andthe situation remains serious owing to the low stocks held by the railway under -takings and industrial users and the difficulty of railing more than a certainamount of coal in any one month from the Bengal and Bihar coalfields. during january railway stocks fell from 15-6 to 12-9 days&apos; consumption. As regardsFebruary, the Government of India decided that (a) the requirements for bunkers, steel works, public utilities and railways,should be met in full, with priorities for the railways;(b) 30,000 tons should be made available for export;(c) all other consumers must be cut by at least 15 per cent, below the rationsto which they would otherwise be entitled.60. Bengal Health situation. The cholera and malaria situations areimproving, but smallpox continues to increase. More doctors have been recruitedfor emergency service by offering more attractive terms. The number of hospitalshas been increased in the rural areas, where new treatment centres have been opened and civil medical mobile units organised. Nearly 3 million cholera inocula-tions and over 3 million vaccinations have now been performed, although thesefigures are below the targets set. Synthetic anti-malarial drugs are being widelyused in hospitals and dispensaries as a substitute for quinine, thus releasingquinine for more general distribution. They cannot, however, altogether replacequinine, as they have to be administered under medical supervision.Naval, Military and A ir Force A activities.61. Royal Indian Navy. Coastal Units of the Royal Indian Navy have beenactively engaged in supporting the operations in Arakan.Rivers were searched for enemy supply, craft. Patrols were maintained inthe Naaf River to prevent enemy movement by water. Enemy positions werebombarded and a Japanese Commando Force attempting to raid Maungdawwas broken up.Military.62. Italy.-Indian troops have been engaged throughout month both onthe 8th Army front, where they have done well in several minor actions, and in front of Cassino. In assaults on this town and on Monastery Hill they have been involved in heavy fighting and have sustained appreciable casualties.63. North-West Frontier. In Waziristan there have been minor tribalraids which have necessitated air proscription in Kurram River and Scindeareas.   The Fakir of Ipi&apos;s headquarters have been bombed,64. Burma. The Japanese ambitious plan to isolate and destroy the7th Indian Division in Arakan has failed after a three weeks&apos; battle. The enemysucceeded in seizing the Ngakyedauk Pass and cutting the main Bawli Maungdawroad. This for a time cut our forces in half East and West of the Mayu range and cut off the 7th Indian Division from its supplies. The latter, by forming abox and fighting it out, foiled the plan of the Japanese and rendered possible theencirclement of the latter in their turn by British Indian formations. The standof the .7th Indian Division was made possible by Allied air supremacy which enabled the beleaguered forces to be supplied from the air. The pass has nowbeen cleared and contact re-established. Over 1,500 Japanese dead have beencounted and their seriously wounded are estimated to be about 3,000, while our
casualties were only about 300. In the Kaladan area West African troops havemade progress and have occupied Kyauktwo and Taungdaung.Fighting has continued in the Chin Hills and on the Chindwin. Some50 Japanese casualties were inflicted in successful ambushes by troops and levies.Chinese troops are making progress in the Hukawng Valley in the directionof Shingbwyang, and inflicting casualties.65. Air. -Enemy activity was on a considerably increased scale withreconnaissances over the sea and battle fronts, and fighter sweeps over Arakan.The latter failed to interfere with our close support and supply droppingoperations.RAP. bombers raided airfields to disrupt enemy air effort over the battle area. Heavy damage was caused to supply dumps. Rail targets at Mandalaywere bombed. Dive-bombers gave close support to troops in Arakan. Manyground attack sorties were flown against rail, road and river targets with considerable success.U.S.A.A.F. heavy bombers attacked Bangkok and Akyab. Medium bombers attacked communication targets and dumps, and also gave direct support totroops.Convoys, barges, river steamers and enemy concentrations were success-fully attacked by fighters and fighter bombers.Over 4,000 tons of supplies were dropped, which had a considerable effect onthe success of ground operations.66. General. Morale remains high, particularly amongst troops withprospects of early action. British troops are keen but they desire an authoritativestatement on plans for demobilisation and for a reduction in the length of service overseas. Indian troops are still anxious about the economic position in their homes.67. Pensions. The Service disability and family pensions of indian military pensioners have recently been slightly increased to bring them into line with civil increases. Rules for the grants of pensions to Indian commissioned officers, Viceroy&apos;s Commissioned Officers and Indian other ranks are beingliberalized to bring them into line with those in force in the United Kingdom.68. Welfare. ENSA in India has set up an organisation for the entertain-ment of British troops, including S.E.A.C., with live acts. A separate organisa-tion for the entertainment of Indian troops has been formed in Bombay with the title of ENSINDIAN.69. Electricity supply. An inquiry is being made as to what extent help from military sources should be given to power stations supplying load for essential war industries and for transportation.70. Prisoners of war. 500 Italian prisoners of war were despatched toAustralia for agricultural work in December, making a total of 2,500 in all.71. Medical. Health continues to be reasonably satisfactory. A hospitalof 8,000 beds is being provided at Bangalore in buildings being evacuated byprisoners of war.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.     i72. Occupied Burma. Japanese propaganda has made much of the officialwelcome to Burma to S. C. Bose and his &quot; Provisional Government of India &quot; asan occasion for expressing anti-British sentiments.73. Recent information shows that the townsman is having great difficultyin getting food and. that prices are high. Ba Maw&apos;s Government appears to be making great efforts to improve matters, even to the extent of being outspokenwith the Japanese. Their efforts to control prices have, however, been criticised,in the Burmese press as having the result that many goods have disappeared fromthe market.
THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,&apos;and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Food Supplies.East A frica.74. A telegram was received from East Africa at the end of Februaryreporting some improvement in the food situation there. The authorities reportedthat harvesting of native crops in the Central Province of Kenya had made it possible to reduce famine issues to that area and there is also a possibility thatUganda requirements of imported food may be less than previously estimated.No change has been reported from Tanganyika. The telegram pointed out atthe same time that there was still danger from locust damage and that future prospects depended on the main rains being normal. It was still, therefore,impossible to say whether the total import requirement of 130,000 tons could bereduced.Ceylon.75. The total cereal stocks in Ceylon are at present satisfactory, standingat the end of February at roughly 65 days&apos; consumption. As indicated in previous reports, however, a supply of rice is an essential, and for her future suppliesCeylon is still dependent for her minimum import requirement of 10,000 tons amonth on the shipment of supplies from Egypt or Brazil. An unexpected alloca-tion has been made of 6,000 tons of rice from Australia, but it is understood thatthe Australian Government have generously supplied this quantity from theirown reserves and no further supplies can be expected from that source for thetime being at any rate.Northern Rhodesia.,76. The Governor of Northern Rhodesia has reported an improvement inthe maize position. An offer of maize from Southern Rhodesia has been accepted and further supplies are expected from the Congo. European maize prospectsin Northern Rhodesia are good, native crops average to backward. It is too early yet to say whether production will be sufficient to meet all demands until.the next crop in March 1945.Cocoa Prices.77. There has been a serious decline in cocoa production in British WestAfrica, particularly in the Gold Coast where it is a factor of great economic importance. The decline is largely due to disease, but has been aggravated bythe neglect of farms during the last few seasons. Cocoa is, however, valuable asan oilseed as well as a food, and is at present in great demand in America and canada as well as in the United Kingdom. It has, therefore, been agreed that prices shall be raised for the coming season to encourage the cleaning and replant-ing of farms.78. Consultations are in progress between the West African Governmentsconcerned, the Resident Minister and the West African Produce Control Board,and it is anticipated that there will be an increase of approximately 66 per cent;in the Gold Coast and of 42 per cent, in Nigeria. The prices will be announced at the Budget Sessions of the respective Legislative Councils in March.79. The increased expenditure will be borne by the West African ProduceControl Board, and is one method by which the Board&apos;s profits on cocoa will ultimately be returned to the native producer.Ceylon Rubber.80.   In order further to stimulate the production of natural rubber, of whichCeylon is by far the most important source of supply now available to the United[27151]    . d
Nations, a scheme has been agreed with the Ceylon Government whereby the priceof rubber will be adjusted each quarter in accordance with actual productionin the quarter preceding. These schemes represent a compromise, since Depart-ments here did not feel disposed to accede to the Ceylon Governments request for an unconditional increase of 5d. per lb., on the ground that this would resultin substantial additional expense with no guarantee of increased supplies.Defence.West Indies (January Report, paragraph 107).81. The West Indian Infantry Battalion, which is to serve with theMediterranean Forces, will include coloured troops from Bermuda. A numberof white Bermudian troops will also be brought to Europe for service with aBritish regiment.Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.82. The tendency of both communities to dwell upon their future inPalestine has become more marked and has been accompanied by signs ofantipathy between Arabs and Jews, each carping and nagging at the political activities of the other. Arab politicians have made no progress in the formationof a representative body, and this is attributed largely to the stiff-necked anduncompromising attitude adopted by the Husseini faction. The Arab population,generally, has displayed little interest in the elbowings and jockeyings of their local politicians.83. In recent weeks a recrudescence of terrorism, atttributed to Jewishextremists, has taken the form mainly of attacks on personnel of the PalestinePolice and outrages against Government property.84. On the night of the 14th-15th February in Haifa, a British Inspectorand a British Constable challenged two suspicious characters carrying a parcel,who turned out to be Jews. While the Inspector was examining the parcel one ofthe Jews shot him and the Constable; both of these officers subsequently died fromtheir wounds.  The parcel was found to contain Stern group pamphlets.85.   On the night of the 3rd February, an Arab taxi-driver surprised twoJews tampering with a wall near the entrance to Saint George&apos;s Cathedral.  One 1of them threatened him with a pistol. He informed the police patrol, and togetherwith another Arab, accompanied the police in pursuit of the Jews.   The latteropened fire, fatally wounding the second Arab, and then made good their escape.86. At Haifa, on the 24th February, a bomb which had been buried in the runway outside the garage of Mr. F. C. Horsburgh, Deputy Superintendent ofPolice, exploded under his car as he drove out. The car was wrecked, but the officerescaped with superficial injuries. A second bomb planted by the side of a road,connected by wire to a press button some 60 metres distant, was exploded as a police traffic car containing British Inspectors Miller and Frost and BritishSergeant Fairf oul, was passing. The car was damaged but the occupants escapedinjury. A third unexploded bomb was subsequently found concealed at the sideof another road. These outrages are thought also to be attributable to the Sterngroup.87. As regards attacks against Government property, on the 29th Januaryexplosions at the Government Transport Agency Car Park at Jaffa wrecked onelorry and damaged four others. On the night of the 12th-13th February, bomboutrages were perpetrated at Jerusalem, Haifa and - Tel Aviv, against the immigration Offices, causing damage to buildings and to the archives atJerusalem and Tel Aviv. There were no casualties, but a temporary policemanon guard duty at Haifa was admitted to hospital suffering from shock. A Jew,arrested at the scene of the Jaffa explosions, admitted to being a member of theIrgun Zvai Leumi (the military organisation of the Revisionists (New zionist organisation)), and the Irgun Zvai Leumi have openly admitted responsibilityfor the outrages at Jerusalem, Haifa and Tel Aviv in a letter to the Hebrew Press.88. On the evening of the 26th February, explosions took place at theIncome Tax Offices at Tel Aviv and Haifa, causing extensive damage to the structure of the building at Tel Aviv and slight damage at Haifa. An unexploded
bomb was also found at the Income Tax Office at Jerusalem. There were no casualties in any of these incidents, which are evidently further developments in the anti-Government campaign of the Irgun Zvai Leumi.89. Though unable to refrain from hinting that these outrages were the inevitable result of exasperation caused amongst irresponsible elements by theGovernment&apos;s attitude towards the Yishuv, Jewish press and official bodiesgenerally have strongly condemned the outrages as calculated to harm the Zionistcause at the most critical moment and undermine the work of the AgencyDelegation (mentioned in last month&apos;s report) now in London. Arab feeling at these recent Jewish acts of terrorism has not been as high as might have been expected.90.   There was a slight improvement in Jewish recruiting to the Armyservices, but the recruiting to infantry of both Arabs and Jews remained low.91. The cost of living index rose three points above the December figure,namely, 233. Workers in railway workshops at Haifa were on strike from the2nd to the 5th February. The strike spread to locomotive running sheds, whichwere temporarily taken over by military technicians to ensure operation. the underlying reason was dissatisfaction with the downward adjustment of costof living allowance following the lower index figure for December.Fiji.Dispute in the Sugar Industry.92. On the 18th of February, the Governor reported that the Colonial SugarRefining Company had notified fifty-six tenant farmers and contractors thatit would no longer purchase cane from them. Furthermore, the Company had served notices on forty-six of the farmers concerned, who were the Companytenants, that it intended to terminate their leases on the ground that they had -not complied with the cultivation conditions in their leases.93. At representative meetings held by the growers, considerable indig-nation was expressed at the Company &apos;s action, and resolutions were passedcalling upon the Government either to intervene and compel the Company tocountermand its action, or alternatively, to guarantee to purchase the oane itself;and stating that if the Company persisted in its intention to victimize these particular tenants and contractors, the cane growers as a whole would take their part.94. The Governor, does not consider that it will be possible to persuade theCompany to recede from the position that it has taken up, but has announced his intention of preventing the proposed evictions by Defence Regulation ifnecessary, since sugar production has been declared an essential war industry.95. Proposals for ensuring that the Colonial Government shall in future be placed in a stronger position to prevent conflicts arising- in the industrybetween the Company and the cane farmers have been telegraphed to the Governorby the Secretary of State.West Indies.Higher Education.96. The West Indies Higher Education Committee of the Commission on higher Education in the Colonies, the appointment of which was noted in myreport for January, has now left for the West Indies.Empire Parliamentary Association.97. The Association has arranged for a delegation of four members of theHouse of Commons to visit the West Indies during the month of March and thebeginning of April. The members are Captain MacDonald, Captain Gammans,Mr. Wilmot and Mr. Henderson Stewart and the Colonies to be visited are british Guiana, Trinidad, Barbados, the Bahamas and Bermuda, in that order.The visit was arranged after consultation with the Colonial Office and theMinistry of Information, and facilities have been given for the tour by theColonial Office.
