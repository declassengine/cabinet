The Cabinet were, however, anxious that certain points which were raised in discussion, and on the basis of which that authority has been given to you,should be on record, and I send you this minute for that purpose. These pointsare as follows : -(a) The present estimate of requirements.That estimate is, of course, put forward for planning purposes only. It may prove to be in excess of requirements, and in any case supplies on the scale of theestimate or shipping to carry them may not be forthcoming. The Cabinetunderstand, of course, that both the United. States War Department and theWar Office will first put any procurement programme to the responsible combined boards.(b) Existing United Kingdom, standards are not susceptible of reduction.British representatives on the Combined Boards and the Combined civil affairs Committee will be instructed when proposals for allocation come beforethem that they are not to accept commitments which for supply or shippingreasons will result in the lowering of our standards.W.
