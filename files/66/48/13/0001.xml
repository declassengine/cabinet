On the 8th Allied destroyers, minesweepers and landing craft enteredSeeadler harbour without opposition and troops were landed at Lombrun Point.In spite of counter attacks the island of Los Negros appears to be in Allied control.Bismarck Archipelago.12. During the week light naval forces have successfully co-operated with aircraft against enemy small craft.Solomons.13. On the 10th U.S. destroyers shelled enemy positions east of Torokina(Bougainville) and on the 12th shelled an enemy barge base in N.W. Choiseul.During the night of the 11th/12th M.T.Bs. shot down an enemy floatplane off cape St. George.An ti-Submarine Operations.14. Forty-five attacks have been reported, of which 20 were carried out by shore-based aircraft, 14 by carrier-borne aircraft and 11 by surface craft. Twoof the attacks were made in the Indian Ocean and three in the Mediterranean.On the 10th two U-boats were sunk in the S.W. Approaches. One was sunk bya Sunderland and the other by H.M. destroyer Forester with H.M. Canadianships St. Laurent (destroyer), Owen Sound (corvette) and Swansea (frigate);three officers and 42 ratings were taken prisoner. One U.S. and fourH.M. destroyers in co-operation with aircraft sank a U-boat south of Anzio.On the 13th, H.M.C.S. Prince Rupert, (frigate) with two U.S. destroyers and aircraft from the U.S.S.

Three Catalinas probably sank a German U-boat southof Capetown on the 11th, and ELM. ships Starling, Wildgoose and Magpie(sloops) in co-operation with aircraft from H.M.S. Vindeao (escort carrier)probably sank another in the N.W. Approaches on the 15th. A Liberator possiblysank one in the S.W. Approaches on the 11th.15. In the Bay of Biscay on the 10th enemy destroyers and torpedo boats were sighted on an easterly course escorting a U-boat. In an attack byMosquitoes four out of ten escorting Ju. 88s were shot down.Enemy Intelligence.16. On two occasions during the week Tirpitz has been reported to becarrying out trials following her repairs, and it is probable that, if it is decidedto bring her south, she is now ready to sail.Scheer, Hipper, Nurnberg and Leipzig were photographed at Gdynia on the8th; Emden had left.17. Photographic reconnaissance of the French Channel coast shows thatbeach obstructions have been erected along the greater part of the coast.The Rove tunnel at Marseilles and the St. Mandrier tunnel at Toulon arebeing fitted up as shelters for small craft.U-boats.18. The main disposition of U-boats in the N. Atlantic appears to have moved further west and is at present in mid-Atlantic.It is now evident that Germany probably possesses at least two types of smallU-boats. The W-boat is about. 90. feet long and is propelled by diesel engineswith a speed of 35 knots on the surface and 25 knots submerged. The crew isreported to number 18.[27110] b
Another type is reported to be about 60 feet long with a crew of six. Fourlarge hooks are fitted to the hull, which may be for hoisting on to a parent ship.It is not known how the boat is propelled or what its capabilities are.It is reported that rocket projectors for anti-aircraft use are being mountedon U-boats in Biscay ports.Enemy Attack on Shipping.19. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked three ships. a ship was sunk off Palmero, a tanker was torpedoed in Addu Atoll harbour andanother tanker was sunk in the Western Caribbean.A ship, in coastal convoy, was damaged by a mine off the East Coast, and asmall ship in coastal convoy was slightly damaged by gunfire from enemycoastal batteries in the Strait of Dover.20. Shipping losses by enemy action in February totalled 89,000 tons, whichis the lowest monthly total so far recorded, subject to any additions due to latermodification. The losses by U-boat which amounted to ten ships totalling59,000 tons occurred mainly in the Indian Ocean, where eight ships (52,000 tons)were sunk. In the Atlantic one ship was sunk near Iceland (C) and another inthe Gulf of Guinea. Enemy aircraft sank two ships, one in Icelandic waters and the other in the Mediterranean. One ship was mined and sunk in theMediterranean and E-boats sank one ship in coastal convoy in Home Waters.Marine risks accounted for 27,000 tons making a total of 116,000 tons lost duringthe month.Protection of Seaborne Trade.21. -During the week ending the 12th, 946 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these, 258 were in ocean convoys and 688 in British coastal convoys,&apos; Five escort carriers, one anti-aircraft ship, 71 destroyers (including23 U.S. destroyers) and 105 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes (including oneU.S. cutter) were employed on escort duties.Six homeward bound ocean convoys, consisting of 141 ships and three outward bound convoys consisting of 86 ships arrived at their destinations without loss.A convoy from N. Russia originally of 32 ships lost one by U-boat attack before-arrival.22. During February, 15 ocean convoys of 577 ships arrived in the UnitedKingdom, and 18 outward bound ocean convoys of 639 ships reached their destinations without loss. Included in these figures are one convoy of 37 ships from N. Russia and two convoys of 58 ships to N. Russia. One outward convoyoriginally of 6 ships lost one by U-boat attack whilst the convoy was scattered bybad weather in the N. Atlantic.In the Western Atlantic and Caribbean, 1,361 ships in 121 convoys reached their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying.23. Aircraft have laid mines- off the Frisian Islands, off the north coast of France and in the Bay of Biscay.In the Gulf of Siam aircraft have laid mines off Sichang.Enemy Mirielaying, Allied Minesweeping.24. No minelaying by enemy surface craft or aircraft has been reported during the week ending the 15th.The mine totals are : 4,693 ground and 4,273 moored.During the clearance of a dangerous area off Salerno 68 mines have been destroyed.One ground mine was destroyed off Anzio on the 8th.Enemy Merchant Shipping.25. During the period 1st to 15th February, 18 enemy ships totalling42,739 tons were sunk or captured and four ships totalling 12,318 tons were seriously damaged. Of the ships sunk, five of 12,135 tons were in theMediterranean.
Six of the larger ships engaged in the ore trade have sailed from Bilbao for france during the week.The s.s. Saumur (2,955 tons) loaded with ore reached Barcelona on the 14then route for France. An unidentified ship called the Conam loaded 720 tons ofore at Segunto and sailed on the 8th.The German s.s. Kilissi (3,723 tons), laden with oranges, was sunk by aircraft on passage from Valencia to France.The Italian tanker Celeno (3,741 tons) and the Bulgarian s.s. Tzar Ferdinand(1,994 tons) sailed from Piraeus on the 11th.Russian Naval Intelligence.26.   The present estimated composition of the Russian Navy is as follows :-Northern Fleet. 1 flotilla leader, 8 destroyers, 6 escort vessels and26 submarines.Baltic Fleet. 1 battleship, 2 new cruisers, 1 minelayer, 3 flotilla leaders,11 destroyers, 6 escort vessels and about 50 submarines.Black Sea Fleet.-1 battleship, 2 new and 2 old cruisers, 5 destroyers and not more than 20 submarines.Pacific Fleet. 2 flotilla leaders, 9 destroyers and about 100 submarines.Caspian Flotilla. 5 gunboats and about 8 submarines.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern and Central Sectors.27. - The Germans claim to have made some progress in counter-attacksS.W. of Narva and to have repulsed Russian attacks both at Narva and in thePskov and Nevel areas.Shepetovka Sector.28. The Russian forces which cut&apos; the railway Lwow-Odessa at Voloehiskare now well across the railway between Tarnopol and Proskurov. Fighting hasbeen taking place in the streets of Tarnopol and, further east, the Russians have cut the railway leading to Proskurov from the south-west.Dnieper Bend.29. On the 10th, after five days&apos; fighting, the Russians broke throughtowards Uman, capturing the town and subsequently advancing beyond it to theS.W., where they have now crossed the River Bug along a stretch of some35 miles. Widening the front of their advance, the Russians took Novo Mirgorodon the 11th and have continued since then to advance southwards in the directionof Pervomaisk.Lower Dnieper.30. On the 9th a Russian thrust S.W. of Krivoi Rog broke through theGerman positions and cut the railway Znamenka-Nikolaev. Advancing rapidlysouth-westwards, the Russians succeeded in encircling several German divisions in the area N.E. of Nikolaev, which is itself in imminent danger of capture.This Russian advance left the Germans with a long salient N.E. of Kherson, butthis has now been almost eliminated, and Kherson itself was captured by theRussians on the 13th.General.31. The three Russian thrusts, in the Shepetovka, Uman and Krivoi Rogareas, have now almost merged into a single movement covering a front of400 miles, in the course of which the Russians claim to have inflicted heavydefeats on 35 German divisions, including 13 Panzer divisions, apart fromthose surrounded east of Nikokiev. The Germans are fighting a harddelaying action, but Russian pressure is evidently very strong indeed. TheGermans had concentrated the bulk of their available armour to protect theimportant railway Lwow-Odessa, and there can be little doubt that they have suffered heavy losses of material owing to the very boggy state of the ground.[27110]       . b2
In the extreme south the position of the German forces is especiallydangerous. The forces encircled there will have great difficulty in breaking out,and the Russians are now so close to Nikolaev that other formations may find their way of retreat cut.The Germans may now try to withdraw all their forces across the Bug andthen hold the west bank of the river at least for a time. The river is not, however,a very effective obstacle for most of its length, and they may not be able to holdit for long, as the Russians are already across in its upper reaches.Italy.32. Until the 15th there had been no major activity on any of the fronts,but at 0830 on the 15th a heavy Allied attack went in on Cassino. The mainattack was initiated by an intense air bombardment. At noon the infantry went into attack supported by tanks and preceded by an artillery barrage. The latestnews of the progress of this attack is that at 1600 hours our infantry was fightingits way through the streets of Cassino. The weather on the 15th was the firstpossible opportunity, for some time, for a large-scale employment of our air and ground forces on this offensive.In the bridgehead the lull reported in last week&apos;s Resume has continued, atleast so far as the enemy is concerned. For our own part, some small advanceshave been made west of the village of Case Carano. On the 14th a gain of about1,000 yards was reported from this area by U.S. troops, and the following dayU.S. Parachute troops took two strong points immediately west of the scene ofthe previous successes; these they held against heavy enemy counter-attacks.Fresh formations have arrived in the bridgehead to relieve some of those who have suffered heavily in the recent fighting.There is little news from other sectors of the battle fronts. In the Gariglianoarea, more regrouping of our formations has been taking place, including the arrival of fresh formations from outside Italy, which have relieved other tiredformations. In the Eighth Army Sector, had weather continues and heavy rainhampered operations during the earlier part of the week; although the weathercleared on the 10th, a heavy fall of snow in the area, of Torricella was reported on the night of the 12th/13th. In these conditions there has been only activepatrolling and, by the enemy, some small attacks against units of an indian division on the 12th and following day.Yugoslavia.33. In attacking a German column near Cetinje in Montenegro the partisans inflicted over 240 casualties and took 85 prisoners. Fighting hascontinued in Herzegovina, where the Partisans engaged Croat forces nearTrebinje (15 miles north of Dubrovnik). The heaviest fighting in Yugoslaviais taking place near Prijedor (25 miles N.W. of Banjaluba). The Partisans haveinflicted over 500 casualties&apos; on the enemy in&apos; a week&apos;s fighting in the course ofwhich a number of German attacks have been repulsed. The Germans are reportedto be bringing reinforcements into this area.Greece.Operations against the enemy.34. E.L.A.S. forces claim to have ambushed German troops west of Corinthin the Peloponnese and to have killed 100 of the enemy.Civil War.35. Unconfirmed reports state that E.A.M./E.L.A.S. have formed a provisional Governmental Committee in the mountains of Greece. It has alsobeen stated that E.L.A.S. troops will, in future, take orders from this Committeeand no longer from E.A.M.Burma.A rnkan.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)t36^ ivYest of the Mayu Range our troops have advanced to some five miles south of Maungdaw and have cleared a number of Japanese positions from thevicinity of the Maungdaw-Buthidaung road to the east. East of the Mayu rangeour troops, after severe fighting, have occupied Buthidaung
In the Kaladan Valley, West African troops have now withdrawn west ofthe Pi Chaung, a tributary of the Kaladan River. The enemy in this area are estimated to be some 3,000 strong.Chin Hills.37. Japanese troops have advanced west of the Manipur river (runningfrom Imphal south past Fallam) to a point some 10 miles N.W. of Tiddim. TheJapanese have also cut the road some 25 miles north of Tiddim thus temporarilyisolating some of our troops further south.In the Kabaw Valley (running parallel and west of the Chindwin andjoining it east of Fort White), a Japanese force with some light tanks has been encountered by our patrols.Huhawng Valley.38. Following the capture of Maingkwan, Chinese troops have now cut theroad astride the Japanese line of withdrawal.   &apos;Pacific Theatre.New Britain.39. U.S. Marines who landed on the Willaumez Peninsula have now capturedTalasea and its landing ground. A further TJ.S. landing on the north coast wasmade on the 11th at Eleonora Bay (west of the base of Willaumez Peninsula).In the south coast advanced elements from Arawe have reached points some55 miles east of Arawe.Bougainville.40. There has been a revival of Japanese activity on Bougainville Island,where they shelled one of the U.S. airfields at Torokina on the 7th and 8th. Anattack followed on the 8th/9th and achieved shallow penetrations of the perimeter.The situation is said to have been restored with 100 Japanese killed againstU.S. 5 killed and 93 wounded.AIR SITUATION.General Review.41. Targets in Germany notably Berlin and Brunswick were bombed bystrong formations in daylight. At night, attacks on Le Mans and Stuttgartconstituted the main effort.On one night, about 160 German long-range bombers attacked this country.In Italy, heavy and medium bombers attacked enemy positions on theCassino front.In the Pacific, Allied activity was considerable at Bougainville and raids onRabaul, Wewak and Los Negros were constant and effective.United Kingdom.42. In daylight, no enemy aircraft crossed our coasts. On the night ofthe 14th/15th, about 160 long-range bombers attacked London, the HomeCounties and East Anglia; it is estimated that 80 of these reached theGreater London area. A total of 13 enemy bombers were shot down; seven by fighters and four by A.A. over this country and two by intruders over Holland.On the following night, 15 enemy aircraft crossed the S.E. coast, five penetratingto the Greater London area. On three other nights during the week, a total of13 enemy bombers operated off and over the Sussex coast.Home Waters.43.

Oh the 9th, heavy bombers of the Eighth U.S. Air Force, escorted by fighters, dropped 692 tons of bombs on Berlin through heavy cloud, 269 tons onthe Hanover- area and 72 tons at Nauen, north of Brandenburg.   In addition,
137 tons were dropped on other targets in Germany. Two days later, 207 tons were released over munster, followed, on the 15th, by 662 tons on Brunswick;in both instances cloud-bombing technique was employed. During! these operations, 36 enemy fighters were destroyed, three probably destroyed and13 damaged. Ten bombers and nine fighters did not return out of the 994 and1,440, respectively, despatched.Escorted Marauders bombed the rail centre at Aulnoye, two airfields andan engineering factory in France.On five days, military objectives in Northern France were attacked by liberators, Marauders, Mitchells, Bostons, Mosquitoes or Typhoons.

On the night 13th/14th, 212 Halifaxes (one missing) and Mosquitoesdropped 960 tons of bombs at Le Mans, where the railway centre was the target.Visibility was good and accurately placed markers were well backed up byconcentrated bombing.On the night 15th/16th, Bomber Command despatched 1,090 aircraft on various missions, including 863 on Stuttgart and 140 on railway yards at Amiens.The attack on Stuttgart (where 2,596 tons were released) appeared to be some-what spread, but at Amiens (520 tons) a good concentration was achieved. Fromthe night&apos;s operations, 39 heavy bombers and one Mosquito are missing and eightbombers crashed.Factories in the South of France, engaged in the aircraft industry, wereintensively attacked by special formations of Lancasters. A sharp raid was madeat Marignane, near Marseilles on the night 9th/10th; 164 tons were dropped.*On the night 10th/11th, 102 Lancasters were despatched. From below cloud-base,about 150 tons were dropped at Clermont Ferrand near Vichy and a similartonnage was released at Chateau Roux/Deals.

A total of 1,060 tons of bombs were dropped, mostly onCassino targets. A considerable number of bombers, due to 10/10th cloud, made no attack.Fighter-bombers attacked a diversity of targets in the battle areas and in thevicinity of Rome. These attacks were principally directed against enemy positions, communications and gun sites. At least 50 M.T. were destroyed and anumber of others damaged; two oil cisterns were seen to explode and about 25 oilwagons and two supply dumps were set on fire. Good results were achieved by bombing and machine-gun attacks on troops, guns, bridges, railways, roads and atank repair depot. Light bombers were also engaged on similar operations,particular attention being given to roads in the Rome area. Only on a fewoccasions during these operations were an appreciable number of enemy fighterssighted. One formation of Invaders was, however, intercepted by 22 enemy fighters and four Invaders were lost. Fighters maintained defensive patrols overthe battle areas and 15 enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of 22 allied aircraft. A total of 2,500 sorties was flown by Allied fighters and fighter-bombers.Medium and heavy bombers continued to attack the Italian railway system.The Rome yards at Tiburtina and Littorio were bombed by a total of 122medium bombers; reconnaissance of the former railway centre showed that 70units of rolling stock were either derailed or damaged and that no through move-ment was possible. A further 473 Marauders and Mitchells attacked a numberof other rail centres; the principal targets were at Florence, Fabriano (52 miles.S.E of Arezzo), Orte (14 miles EXE. of Viterbo), Perugia (82 miles N. of rome), Orvieto, Spaleto (15 miles S. of Foligno), Prenestina (Rome), and in theSpezia area at Sarzana and Viareggio. . .Vide Appendix VII.
Escorted Fortresses made a heavy attack on the rail centre at Padua, where280 tons were dropped. Considerable damage was done to storage sheds andcoods sidings, and the main gas holder at the works south of the station was destroyed. During these operations 80 enemy fighters were encountered, of which23 were shot down for the loss of three heavies and three escorting fighters.Smaller scale attacks were made by heavy bombers on the railways at Prato andPontassieve. At night, 27 Wellingtons and 10 heavies bombed, through cloud,the yards at Genoa.San Stefano (N. of Orbetello) harbour and town were attacked by a totalof 168 medium bombers.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from recent Raid Assessment Reports.Germany.Augsburg. Photographs taken after the attacks on the 25th February(U.S.A.A.F.) and the 25th/26th (R.A.F.) are somewhat obscured by cloud andsnow. An immediate interpretation, however, shows severe damage, particularlyin the town centre. Amongst industries affected are M.A.N. Maschinenfabrik(priority 1), Messerschmitt A.G. (priority 1) and Vereinigte Landwirtschafts-Maschinen.Further photographs, though of poor quality, confirm the above damage anddisclose that, while it is very severe indeed to all classes of property, it is particu-larly notable to industry. In North Augsburg hardly a factory of importance hasescaped and the important M.A.N. Maschinenfabrik (makers of Diesel engines for ships, including U-boats) has suffered more severely than the first photographsindicated; the majority of its numerous workshops have sustained heavy damage.It is noteworthy that among the many factories that have been severely damagedare at least six engaged in the cotton trade.Berlin/Wildau. Photographs of the Berliner Maschinenbau A.G., makersof steam locomotives, taken soon after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 8th Marchshow that heavy smoke covers the south-west part of the works, and that fires areburning.in the southern half. Buildings on fire include the bolt and toolmanufac-turing shops, mechanical shops and the painting shop, while the forge at thenorth of the factory is also burning.Regensburg. ^Photographs taken after the two U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the25th February, one by the Fifteenth Air Force from Italian bases, and the other by the Eighth Air Force from Britain, show that the Priifeniing factory ofMesser.sehmitt A.G. (Me. 109 components) was very severely damaged. All themain workshops and assembly buildings which had escaped in the successful attack of August 1943, or which had since been repaired, have been damaged.The two undamaged assembly shops in that attack on the north side of the workshad been extended to form one very large assembly shop, and this building has suffered heavily throughout its entire length. Of the other twelve main assemblybuildings or workshops, five have been very severely damaged, two have receivedmedium damage and the remaining five have not been repaired since they were destroyed or damaged in the August attack. In addition, many other buildings have been affected, and these include a flight hangar, the gun-testing range, smallworkshop and component-erecting shop and 14 small unidentified buildings. Atleast 18 single-engined fighters on the airfield have been damaged.Quakenbruck Airfield. Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack onthe 21st February show that considerable damage was caused in the workshop andbarrack area to the north-east of the -landing ground. Two long workshops were destroyed and two other buildings severely damaged; two barrack buildings also suffered heavily.  A few craters were made in the landing ground.France.Bergerac Airfield. Photographs taken following the U.S.A.A.F. attack onthe 5th March show that, on the south side of the airfield, one large hangar hasbeen severely damaged and a small hangar completely gutted. Five barrackbuildings have received direct hits and four of them have been severely damaged.Several small unidentified buildings have also been hit.Le Mans. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken after the attack shows a large number of craters spread across the marshalling yards, thegreatest damage being the south yards, and 25 direct hits have destroyed aconsiderable number of trucks, and, dislocated many of the lines. Several large buildings and huts have been destroyed or damaged, including two roundhouses.In addition, there are about 40 craters on the airfield to the east, and one building of the Gnome et Rhone Aero Engine Works has been gutted.Marignane. An immediate interpretation of photographs, taken after the attack on the 9th/10th March on the S.N.C.A.S.E. aircraft factory and airfield,shows that the assembly shop, the heat treatment shop, the offices, a flight hangarand, four small unidentified buildings were severely damaged, while the componentsstore and garages (two buildings), two workshops and another hangar were eithercompletely or very nearly destroyed. Several other buildings, including five work-shops and two hangars, were slightly damaged and at least four aircraft suffered,three of them severely.
