The War Cabinet directed that the numbers of full-time workers inCivil Defence (including Police and National Fire Service) should be reducedby a further 15,000 before the end of 1943, in addition to the reduction of 75,000from the 30th June, 1942, previously approved. This gave a total reduction of90,000 to be effected between the 30th June, 1942, and the 31st December 1943.The reduction up to the 31st December, 1943, was 87,600.
Part II.- 1st July, 1942, to 31st December, 1943.Allocations.6. Allocations for this period were originally fixed by the War Cabineton the 11th December, 1942 (W.M. (42) 167th Conclusions). Following, a reviewof the Man-power-position in May, 1943 (LP. (43) 115), revised allocations were fixed by the War Cabinet on the 22nd July, 1943, for the period the 1st april to the 31st December, 1943 (W.M. (43) 102nd Conclusions).The original demands put forward by the Services, Supply and other Depart-ments for the full period of eighteen months amounted to a total of 2,676,000.Cuts amounting to 1,100,000 were imposed by the War Cabinet on the11th December, 1942, leaving a net allocation of 1,576,000 to be found from industry and the non-industrial classes. (The gross allocation amounted to-1,729,000, but of this total 153,000 was to be found by a cut of 78,000 in thenumbers working for Ministry of Supply and a cut of 75,000 in whole-time civil defence services.)The Man-Power Review of May, 1943, showed that the numbers being obtained from the non-industrial classes were falling rapidly, and furthermorethat it was not likely to be possible to reduce the non-munitions industriessufficiently to meet the then existing Forces allocations and the increases requiredin munitions. Accordingly new allocations were made for the period the1st April to 31st December, 1943. When these new allocations were added tothe increases that had been achieved between the 1st July, 1942, and the31st March, 1943, the effect was to reduce the gross allocation for the whole periodof eighteen months (the 1st July,. 1942, to the 31st December, 1943) from 1,729,000to 1,691,749 and to increase the cuts on Ministry of Supply work and civil defence to 254,500 (Ministry of Supply 164,500 and Civil Defence 90,000). Thenet increase allocated was thus changed from 1,576,000 to 1,437,249.Achievements.Forces.. 7.   The revised net allocation of 1,437,249 included 1,159,809 for the Armed.Forces.  The total intake counting against the allocations for the whole period of18 months was &quot;1,161,312.  An analysis of these figures is given in the followingTable:-Men.				Women.			Service.
