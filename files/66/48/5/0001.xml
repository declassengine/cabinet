THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTCORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER and marshal TITO.I.Marshal Tito to the Prime Minister, dated 9th February, 1944.(Telegraphic Text.)Your Excellency,FOLLOWING message contained in your paper of 5th February and the message of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, I was obliged to consult membersof the National Committee of Liberation of Yugoslavia and members of Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation on the points raised in those messages.The analysis of these points led to the following conclusions : (1) The Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia, as you know, confirmed at their second session on 29th November, 1943, thatthey firmly stand for the Union of Yugoslav Nations. However, aslong as there are two Governments : one in Yugoslavia and the other in Cairo, there can be no complete union. Therefore the Governmentin Cairo must be suppressed and with them Draza Mihailovich. ThatGovernment must account to the Government of A.C.N.L.Y. for havingsquandered enormous sums of the nation&apos;s money.(2) The National Committee of Liberation of Yugoslavia should beacknowledged by the Allies as the only Government of yugoslavia and King Peter II, in support, to submit to the laws of A.C.N.L.Y.(3) If King Peter accepts all these conditions, Anti-Fascist Council ofNational Liberation will not refuse to co-operate with him on condition that the question of the Monarchy in Yugoslavia be decidedafter the liberation of Yugoslavia by the free will of the people.(4) King Peter II should issue declaration to the effect that he has only theinterests of his Fatherland at heart, which he wishes to be free and organised as the people themselves decided after the war is over bytheir free will, and until then he will do all in his power to supportthe arduous struggle of the peoples of Yugoslavia.(5) These conclusions were reached in consideration of the following facts : *(a) A special arrangement with King Peter II during the war wouldhave the opposite effect to that which your Excellency and HisMajesty&apos;s Governments desire. We believe that a huge numberof neutral and hesitant elements, especially in Serbia, would join us, but such a measure on our part would provoke amongstthe patriots of all parts of Yugoslavia, who have been fightingfor three years, serious anxiety and suspicion, especially inCroatia, Slovenia and Macedonia.(b) This would on the one hand shake the morale of our army, while on the other hand the German Ustashi and others would make use of it in their propaganda against us and make it impossiblefor us to mobilise new forces against the invader in partisanWe are convinced that the solution of this matter lies with proposals which we consider do not differ in principlefrom yours and which would have most favourable effect notonly on our struggle for national liberation but also on thestatus of the Allies and of the King himself, who would in thisway be delivered in the eyes of the people of all furtherresponsibility of [group undecipherable] those deeds whichvarious traitors are committing in his name.(6) I hope, your Excellency, that reasons I have given may help you to exertinfluence on far-reaching demands made in this matter, which willextremely indebt the nations of Yugoslavia to His Britannic Majesty&apos;&amp;Government.Yours sincerely,BROZ TITO,President of Committee of liberation of Yugoslavia.[27073]
Prime Minister to Marshal Tito, dated 25th February, 1944.(Telegraphic text.)1. I fully comprehend your difficulties and I welcome the spirit in which you approach them.  I thank you for understanding mine.2. The first step for us is to withdraw our Liaison Officers safely fromMihailovic. Orders have been issued accordingly but may take a fey-/ weeks to fulfil.3. Meanwhile, can you not assure me that if King Peter frees himself fromMihailovic and other bad advisers, he will be invited by you to join his countrymenin the field, provided always that the Yugoslav nations are free to settle theirown Constitution after the war? If I judge this boy aright, he has no dearerwish than to stand at the side of all those Yugoslavs who are fighting the commonfoe, but you can understand thatT cannot press him to dismiss Mihailovic, throwover his Government, and cut off all contact with Serbia before knowing whether he can count on your support and co-operation.4. I have suggested to King Peter that he should return to London to discuss these matters with me. I hope, therefore, that you will on reflection be readyto modify your demands and thus enable us both to work for the unification of yugoslavia against the common enemy. Do not hesitate to make me precise and specific requests. If, meanwhile, I cannot do all you wish, be sure it is not from lack of good will to you or your country.5. I am repeating your telegram to General Wilson and urging him to give you all military support in his power.W. S. C.
