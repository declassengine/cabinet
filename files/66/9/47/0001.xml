Since the date of the Third Ropert of the LloydCommittee, the character of Germany&apos;s oil problem hascompletely altered..&apos; It is no longer possible, to consider.Germany as&quot; an-&apos; isolated unit and,, by estimating the. ratesof intake and outflow, to predict the date at; which she.  -will become critically short of petroleum;products.    &apos;.&apos;&apos;Germany now has to face .a new problem.    She. has to administer continental&quot;Europe with.the probable maximumexports of. Eoumania (4,200,000 tons net)., her ownsynthetic production, 3*00.0,000 tons (i), minor naturalproduction mainly in Greater Germany, Albania and Hungary,1,500,000 tons, benzol and alcohol 500,000 tons (i), andsuch quantities as Russia:   chooses to supply (estimatedat 500*000 tons), a total annual supply of 9*7 million -tons at a maximum.&apos; - .If Germany cannot arrange for Roumanian-oil to becarried by sea&quot; through the Dardanelles to I-Cediterraneanports It will be impossible for her, .in the months immediately ahead, to transport and distribute the totalRoumanian exportable surplus.    Under these circumstances the annual rate of supply from\all sources will fall from,700,000 to 7,600,000 tons.   The latter figure allowsa monthly average for shipments from Roumania and Russiaof 220,000 tons.    In June this year, with the Danube open,and no urgent crops to move, the amount imported was only98,000 tons from Roumania, while an average of 38,000 tonsa month was imported fro:&quot;. Russia in April, May and June.Winter conditions tend to reduce tho volume of rail andriver traffic.    The estimate of 220,000 tons, we&apos;regard asgenerous-, even allowing for full German pressure.2. We have examined detailed estimates of. theconsumption of the -German fighting Services and civilian population since the outbreak of the war and have(i)    No allowance has been made -for any damage to- synthetic plant and-. ..refineries as a;result of aerial bombardment.   &apos;-&apos;-&apos;&quot;.&apos;&apos;\ .
considered reasoned estimates prepared by the Departmentsconcerned of probable future consumption of Germany andItaly.     While the political and strategical uncertaintiesare such that we cannot with confidence rely upon thec of even the most carefully prepared estimate of^ ydre consumption, wo are nevertheless satisfied that therequirements of Germany and Italy for all purposes, whenengaged in war with the British Empire, cannot he reduced below a figure of 8j million tons without serious repercussions upon their xvhole war effort.    The currentsupplies likely to be available to Gorman Europe, ifnone are obtained from America and the middle East, and ifthe Eastern mediterranean is closed, will be below this figure.    Even if full use can be made of the Dardanellesand the Aegean, supplies will only slightly exceed theminimum requirements of the two belligerents, leaving littlefor the rest of Europe.   The consumption of this area(excluding Russia, Roumania (ii), Turkey, Spain and portugal (iii)) in 1938 was 15,000,000 tons&quot; (iv).5. To meet the wide gap between normal requirements and supplies available to Gorman Europe, stocks at 1st Julyare estimated to have been about 7i million tons, of which1,600,000 tons (i) were in Germany, 2,750,000 tons in italy, 2,000,000 tons in France and 1,200,000 tonsdistributed in relatively small amounts throughout therest of Europe.4. Not all the oil estimated to be in stock on 1st Julycan be used because -(a) Before stocks are down to zero, distributiondries up.    When sticks available to GreaterGen any and her garrisons in occupied territoryare as low as 1,000,000 tons, the authorities will virtually lose control over furtherdistribution.   A figure of 400,000 tons each maybe taken as the danger level both in France andin Italy.    For the rest of Europe a reserve of500,000 tons must be allowed.    Thus out of atotal of 7a million tons of stocks, not muchmore than 5 millions can be regarded as freelyavailable.(b) Although this figure would appear at first sightto be sufficient to supply deficienciesnearly twelve months,   provided .^...^ulon were reduced by 50 per cent in occupied anddominated territories, a- breakdown-is likely to occur at a much earlier date, as a result ofuneven distribution as between differentdistricts and various classes of oil.   Thisbreakdown would naturally be accelerated byany destruction resulting from aerial or seaattack.(i) No deduction has been made for any destruction of stocksas a result of aerial bombardment.(ii) See Annex I.(iii) See Annex II.(iv) See iomox III.It may be noted that the statistical method employedintroduces a bias which tends to make all net results
(c) Ow-ng to the &quot;general shortage of supplies in theares under German domination, Germany&quot;willprourbiy find it necessary to transfer stocksfror. Italy and Southern France to northern europe, whore stocks are already low and consumption exceeds current supplies.(d) A substantial portion of the stocks consists of crude oil which will have to be refined in italian, French or Gornan refineries before itcan be used.   There will be appreciable wastagein the process and the utility of the crude oilwill partly depend on the availability ofundamaged local refinery capacity.    Destructionof these refineries will involve the transportof the crude to other refineries, and thuscomplicate the difficult distribution problem with which Gerr-any is in any case faced.(e) Somewhat similar considerations apply to fuel oil, of which the supplies under Axis control are at present adequate.    Circumstancesindicate that it would be to the interest ofGermany to convert substantial amounts of thisfuel oil into other products.    Here again,therefore, the existence of the refineries isof the first importance.    It will be ream-rwappreciated that the greater the number ofthese refineries that can be destroyed, thegreater the difficulties Germany will have intransporting and   treating the fuel oil now ather disposal.5. It is therefore our conclusion that oil represents a very weak link In the economy of the European system under German hegemony.    It Is not, however, a link which,within the next six months will necessarily bream of its&apos;ovm accord.The following points are of great importance:-(a) Statistical and other evidence indicates thatGermany hrs sufficient oil under her     - -immediate control for any major military opera-tion that she may wish to carry out between now and the end of September.    Difficultiesere, however, already being experienced indistributing these supplies to the points atwhich they are required., (b) While it would be impossible within such ashort period to effect actual physicaldestruction sufficient in itself absolutely to...compel the postponement of an Invasion ofEngland, if such Is planned, we believe thatif such destruction were to reach adequateproportions, Germany might well be moved to reconsider these, plans in terms of a longerview, and possibly turn to securing suppliesof oil for example from the middle East orRussia.
(c) Whether there bo destruction of producing plantor hot Germany and Italy must attach great and ir.Tiuedic.te importance to securing sea-bornesupplies (fro::. Russia   and Rounania; via theDardanelles and the Aegean.(d) There is already a serious shortage of oil incertain parts of Europe.    Although restrictionshave been iriposed which are interruptingcivilian life and industrial output, includingfisheries, stocks are being rapidly depletedand unless Germany agrees to release supplies to these countries, conditions must deterioraterapidly.(e) Provided further and permanent supplies are not obtained from Russia and the Middle East, itwill be impossible for general  any to exploit tothe full for her war effort the agricultural and industrial resources of Europe.6. In our view action on the following lines ivouldgreatly accelerate the crisis and night, within acomparatively short period, deprive the German Cormiand of&quot;&apos;    real freedom of strategy:-(a) Destruction of Ger: an hydrogenation andsynthetic plants and refineries is of primary importance, inasmuch   as it would eliminate the largest indigenous source of supply onwhich they rely for flexibility on producinghigh grade petrol and gas oil.(b) Immediate destruction of Italian and Frenchrefineries and stocks located adjacentthereto, before present stocks of crude arerefined.    Apart from, the quantities ofrefined products which might physically be destroyed, damage to the plants themselves would nullify the value to Germany of a high proportion of the crude and fuel oil which she might seek to convert into products of which she has more immediate need.(c) Interference with means of communication from roumania by Danube and by rail, and from Italyand France by rail.(d) While other objectives such as those mentionedabove may be given priority over storageinstallations, depots, loaded tankers, etc.both on the longer view and because they provide better targets -7 no opportunity of attack on these latter should he neglected,since not only is the cumulative effectconsiderable but the regiono.1 disorganisation of distribution may prevent the propersynchronisation of offensive operations.(Signed)    GEOFFREY LLOYDon behalf of the Committee.Richmond Terrace, 1.14TII JULY, 1940.
ANNEX I.R0UI&quot;Stefania.The gross output of the Roumanian oil fields, plusexisting stocks, cannot all be,made available to Gernan-occupjed Europe during the next tvrelvo months.   In order tomaintain Roumanian output, refining capacity and distributingsystem, a considerable quantity of oil has to be used locally.moreover, Roumanian, output has been declining duringthe last three years:1957 7.153,000- tons1958 6,605,000   &quot;1959 6,228,000   &quot;1940 5,800,000   5!    (estimated).If Germany obtained complete control of Roumanianproduction she might succeed in raising output from the1st July, 1940 to June, 1941, to 6,000,000 tons.   Of this total only 4,200,000 tons would be available for Europeanconsumption.   The necessary deductions are set out in the table below:Output 8,000,000 tonsLess estimated consumptionincluding bunkers and consumption and loss atRefineries. 1.800.000     &quot;4,200,000     &quot;Roumanian stocks in June, 1940, amounted to 1,190,000 tonsbut these cannot be considered in the same way as stocks in non-producing countries since the greater part of themmust be permanently immobilised in supporting the structureon which the industry is based.   The total given above wascomprised as follows:-Fields and Pipe Lines 299,000 tonsRefineries 566,000     !!Under lay 12,00u     &quot;Constanza 507,000     &quot;Giurgiu 6.0001,190,000Of these only a part of the stocks at Constanza can beconsidered as immediately available if the eastern mediterranean should become open to Germany and Italyand this quantity would clearly exert very littleinfluence on the situation as a whole.
ANNEX II.SPAIN AND PORTUGAL*Spain and Portugal- have been excluded from Germandominated Europe since at present they are the only twocountries which are continuing to receive supplies from overseas sources.    Spanish stocks, though high inrelationship to the present estimated rate of consumption,are expected to decline materially as a result of steps which are being taken to restrict imports to the amounts which can be carried in the Spanish tanker fleet, the carrying capacity of which is approximately one half ofthe combined estimated consumption of Metropolitan spain and the throughput of the refinery at Teneriffe.Portuguese stocks are low, and Portugal has no tankers ofher ownj    her stocks should therefore be easy   to control.Stocks 1st July, 1940     consumption in tons. 19^8.Spain 400,000 780,000(including Teneriffe ;and cargoes in italian tankers which took refuge in Spanishports).Portugal 50,000 200,000In the case of Spain, 1955-consumptionhas boon adopted as a better comparisonthan 1938 when the civil war v as inprogress.NOTE. In the case of Spain no allowance hasbeen made for British controlledbunkering stations at Las Palmas.In the case of Portugal, bunkers atLisbon and St. Vincent have been excluded from the figures of bothstocks and consumption.
