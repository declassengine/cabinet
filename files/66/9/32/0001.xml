ANNEX I.Recormendation &quot;by Vansittart Committee.Trie Committee are unanimous in feeling thatthe telegram No. 685 despatched last night to the governor of Nigeria, does not  go far enough to meet the existing situation and prohahle developments as revealed &quot;by the telegrams hitherto received from the Governor.The Committee therefore recommend that theGovernor should have authority to inform M. Brunot,  in response to the feelers already received from the french authorities, that in case of need he is authorised &quot;by hisGovernment to say that we will collaborate fully in the effective maintenance of the administration of the Mandate.The Governor of Nigeria should also be informed that itwould be for him to decide, in the light of local developments,in what degree, to what extent and at what momentcollaboration should he carried into effect.The recommendation is put in this form in orderto avoid the danger (a) of the charge of land-grabbing,(h) of giving the Petain Government a seemingly &quot;betterpretext than Oran to declare war.The Governor should he told that if he deems itnecessary to extend the interpretation of collaboration intosomething like the assumption of control, the greatest care should he taken to preserve all the ostensible symhols ofthe French Mandate,  including, above all, the maintenanceof the French Flag,

I am unable to give you authority to put into their full effect your proposals for taking over the Cameroons.For reasons of high policy His Majesty&apos;s Government are at thepresent moment unable to sanction any step which would involve -(a) their being exposed to the charge of seizing territoryat present under French sovereignty, or(b) displacing French administration in their own favour*It appears to them however that, while rigidly observingthe limitations imposed by these two principles, it would bepossible for them to go r, cona&amp;considerable   distance towardsgiving confidence and support to the French Cameroons adminis-tration and towards saving that administration from dissolvinginto chaos 0In the first place they are ready to give explicitguarantees that they will until some permanent arrangement- canbe made provide all the finance necessary to the working of theadministration and apart from this to guarantee fully the salaries and pension rights of the Governor-General himself andof all servants of the Government, civil or military.In the second place, they are prepared to place at thedisposal of the French administration as many officials in the capacity of advisers as may be required.     These adviserswould be at the disposal of the French administration for their help and guidance in every sphere of activity.If there are any further steps on the same lines which you think it desirable to take and which can be taken withoutinfringing the above principles you have full discretion to take them,.     It appears to me that for the time being action on theabove lines, if carried out with tact and effectiveness, should go a long way in putting heart into the French administration and assuring them of our intention to stand by them..     You have full authority to act on the above lines, and I leave you widediscretion to settle all matters of local detail.     You should keep me closely informed of the action you. take*It is not proposed to associate General de Gaulle withthe action at this stageo

Writtenreport from Clifford dated 5th July makes clear (a) Brunotwill in no case surrender the Cameroons to the Enemy andthat his policy is to continue in co-operation with BritishGovernment the defence of the Mandated Territory and to resist all attempts of the enemy whatever nature to effectits surrender.(h)    To refuse to obey any order of the BordeauxGovernment,  to act contrary to his policy as set out aboveor to take any measures in any way hostile to Great Britain.(c) If dismissed by Bordeaux Government inconsequence of or for any other reason he would call on government of Nigeria to protect sovereignity of the Leagueof Nations in the Mandated Territory &quot;by armed force ifthey think fit,      Subject to this he would not resistorders for his dismissal as he knows that resistance wouldhe regarded &quot;by the European community as attempt on his part to assume autocratic power and would lead todissension and possibly civil war.       (it seems clear thatthese people,  although they like his decision, do not likehim personally^.      They want us to assume responsibilityat once-      What he wants from us is not so much declarationof our intention &quot;lo&quot;&quot;take over the Mandate now hut theundertaking of our willingness to do so in the event ofhis dismissal&quot;).&quot;(d) Neither he nor his advisers consider it desirableas yet repeat as yet to hitch themselves to De Gaulle whoso far does not carry weight locally.(e) Brunot sent his chief secretary to Brazzaville5 th July to confer with Bois son and will inform me ofresult.      He believes that latter will never consent to lay down arms and permit enemy invasion of french equatorial Africa,      Army would not let him in any case.(f) Brunot still desires to come to Bunder Abbasin due course to discuss economic and financial nroblemsassuming he is not dismissed.(g) Bureau Officer Commanding troops declares hewill come over to Nigeria with all troops he can musterif Brunot d 1 smircsd and fight with us.      He would not.
