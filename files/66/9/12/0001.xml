Wehave arranged for the construction of pill boxes and have carried out other defensive measures.We have done very well with the means at our disposal, although we have been handicapped by a shortissue of rifles and automatic weapons.And the morale of the aircraft workers, and alsotheir production, has benefited from these practicaldemonstrations of a resolve to defend them in theirfactories against attack on the ground.But we can do nothing on balloon barrages and anti-aircraft guns.That is the side of this defence problem for whichI ask immediate and adequate assistance, confident that theCabinet will recognise the supreme importance of protecting the makers and the making of the Air Force of tomorrow.(Intld)   B.Ministry of Aircraft Production.28th JUNE, 19^0.COPY NO.&quot;2-- ^1
