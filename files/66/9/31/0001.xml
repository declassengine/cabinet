Xr-CHERAQHAEIREDEPARTMENT OP EXTERNAL iJKF-uIRSIREL-uND.4th July,  1940.Dear Mr. Chamberlain,The memorandum handed to me by Mr. MacDonald and your letter of 29th Juno, have been considered by my Government.We are unable to accept the plan outlined, which wenote is purely tentative and has not been submitted toLord Graigavon and his colleagues.The plan would involve our entry into the war.      That isa oourse for which we could not accept responsibility.     Our people would be quite unprepared for it, and Dail Eireann wouldcertainly reject it.We are, of course, aware that the policy of neutralityhas its dangers, but, on the other hand, departure from it wouldinvolve us in dangers greater still.The plan would commit us definitely to an immediateabandonment of our neutrality.     On the other hand, it gives no guarantee that in the end we would have a united Ireland, unlessindeed concessions were made to Lord Graigavon opposed to thesentiments and aspirations of the great majority of the irish people.Our present Constitution represents the limit to which webelieve our people are prepared to go to meet the sentiments ofthe Northern Unionists, but, on the plan proposed, Lord Graigavonand his colleagues could at any stage render the whole projectnugatory and prevent the desired unification by demandingconcessions to which the majority of the people could not agree.By such methods unity was prevented in the past, and it isobvious that under the plan outlined they could be used again.The only way in which the unity which is so needed can in our view be secured is, as I explained to Mr. MacDonald, by the immediateestablishment of a single sovereign all-Ireland Parliament, free to decide all matters of national policy, internal and external -the Government which it would elect being responsible for talcingthe most effective measures for national defence.It was in this connection that I suggested as a line tobe explored the possibility of creating such a parliament by the entry into the parliament here of the present representatives in the parliament at Belfast.I regret that my proposal that the unity of ireland should be established on the basis of the whole country becoming-neutral is unacceptable to your Government.     On the basis of unity and neutrality we could mobilise the whole of the manpower of thiscountry for the national defence.      That, with the high moralewhich could thus be secured and the support of the Irish racethroughout the world, would constitute the most effectivebulwark against attack, and would provide the surest guarantee against any part of our territory being used as a base for operations Britain.The course suggested in your plan could only lead to internal weakness and eventual frustration.Yours sincerely,(Signed;   EAMON de VALERA.f Right Honourable Neville Chamberlain, M.P
