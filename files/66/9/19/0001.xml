(4.0). 259.80TH JUNE. 1940.COPY NO.WAR CABINET.AIR RAID WARNINGS.Copy of a letter addressed to the Prime minister by the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, fighter command,Headquarters,Fighter Command.Royal Air Force,t-    -        -Bentley Priory*.-    Stanmore, Middlesex.29th. June, 1940-.My dear Prime Minister,You have very kindly- allowed me to give you my....... ; opinion on air raid warnings.    Here are my views* foi1what they are worth:-.- 2. We are faced with a serious loss of productionif -&quot;Red&apos;1, warnings are given too freely under thepresent system at night,, to which period, for the timebeing, air raids are confined..      &quot;    &apos; .;3. There is also an&apos;adverse psychological effectL      &apos;     oh the civil population if. they are frequently woken\. -G-&apos;-r   --lip at night by the existing rather, terrifying sirens and&quot;&quot;made to go into air raid, shelters.   Troops  also are.turned out and disturbed to the detriment of their...    work and training next&apos;day.4...        On the other hand.if, for these reasons, wewithhold &quot;Red&quot; air raid warnings at night, two other.. .. -    . difficulties arise :-
5o Firstly, there are numerous establishments(such as docks, marshalling yards, etc.) which have per-mission to maintain special lighting which is-extinguishedonly on the &quot;Red&quot; warning,,    If the &quot;Red&quot; warning isnot given the lights are not extinguishe.d....and thedanger of serious damage is much increased.60 Secondly, the Police and AoS.P. workers complainbecause they have not been given the opportunity of completing the preparations which they m; &apos;:- on receiptof the &quot;Red&quot; warning and the general public, complainsbecause no warning is given to them before the bombsbegin to fall.    Some of them have been to considerabletrouble and expense to provide&quot;themselves with sheltersand they reel &quot;resentful that they have been given no opportunity of using them before the attack begins.Totally undeserved blame is also being attributed tothe; Observer :.Corps, the searchlight ^organisation, etc,who&apos; are,&quot;&apos;- of course, entirely&apos; guiltlessc &apos;-&apos;-&apos;-&apos;   -.&apos; -70        The official view seems to be principally concernedwith devising a method by which the above-mentionedextra lighting may be extinguished without the issueof a &quot;Red&quot; warning;signaland I have been asked to devise anhaving the significance of thecept for the sounding of the sirens0intermediate&quot;Red&quot; warning e:This can be done without any   very great difficulty,I feel myself, however, that the public will insist upon receiving warning of an approaching raid, especially,when the attacks become intensified as they almost certainly will bec    I think at any rate that anannouncement should be made telling the public whatthey are to expect-. ;...&apos;-...8.I/write with all diffidence in giving what isonly a personal opinion, but I should propose somethingon the following lines:- .&quot;The public are notified that it;is the policvof the Government- to be sparing -in the issue ofpublic air raid warnings, especially at night,in order to interfere as little.as possible withthe national productive effort and with the repose&quot; 1 - of individualso- ...&quot;It must be recognised that this policy may ,sometimes result,, in minor attacks being made withoutany warning being issued to the public.&quot;When public ^warnings: are givehj persons engaged on work of national importance are asked to consider themselves as .soldiers. engaged in the fight for- theexistence of -the nation, and to remain at their posw&quot;Other members of the public&quot; are at liberty to-act as they think: fit. but, unless    some shelter 1?available in the immediate vicinity of theirmdwellsit may well be found that the safest course is toremain quietly at home,&quot;9. I wish it were possible to produce a lessmelancholy and terrifying warning than the existing sir^and to cut.down the time over which the warning operates!but these are questions which are incapable of immediatesolution, whei&apos;eas I think that some form of public announcement should, be made as soon as possible.. Yours sincerelsr,HoCT, DOWDINGo
