The object in seizing these islands would be : (a) to deny their use to the enemy and to secure the cable stations.(b) to secure for our own use in the Azores an air base and a refuellingbase if Gibraltar were to become unusable.Advantages; of denying the Islands to the Enemy.3. If enemy naval and air forces were to be established in these islandsour trade would have to be routed far to the westward from Freetown, thusadding to our shipping difficulties and complicating the fuelling problem. Ifenemy land forces were established in the islands a combined operation wouldbe necessary to turn them out.Advantages of securing the Islands for our own use.4. If Gibraltar becomes unusable as a Naval base it would be desirable thatwe should secure for ourselves a base in the Azores, since otherwise we shouldhave no base between Plymouth and Freetown. Naval forces operating fromthe Azores would be in a better position to fill the gap in our patrol linesurrounding Europe than they would if they were to operate from Freetown orPlymouth. Similarly, flying boats could operate from these Islands, althoughit will be a long time before we shall have the requisite number of these aircraft.Circumstances in which we should seize the Islands.5. We have reviewed in some detail the various circumstances in which we might seize these islands. We attach at Annex I a note on the political, economicand strategic effects of Spanish and Portuguese hostility, from which it willbe clear that the implications of an unprovoked aggression against Portugueseterritory would be very serious.  We have, therefore, reached the conclusion that* W.M. (40) 149th Conclusions, Minute 10.[21531]e
it would not be in our interests to seize these islands except in the event of actualSpanish or Portuguese hostility or when it becomes clear beyond reasonable doubtthat either of these Powers intends to intervene against us.6. At present negotiations with the United States of America are takingplace with a view to securing a substantial measure of control at source over theessential raw materials required by the enemy. We understand that there are good prospects of obtaining the co-operation of the Americas in this importantaspect of our plans, and that measures to secure control of shipping and bunkeringfacilities are going ahead satisfactorily. If these negotiations fail, however, andwe are forced to resort to more direct naval action in order to prosecute theblockade, it may be necessary to accept the disadvantages of provoking Spanishand Portuguese hostility and seize these islands even although the attitude of spain and Portugal may be satisfactory. At present, however, it does not seem necessary to contemplate such drastic action.7. As the War Cabinet are aware,* the Governments of Southern rhodesia and the Union of South Africa have prepared plans for the capture of thePortuguese railway from the Southern Rhodesian frontier to the coast ofMozambique and of the port of Beira against the possibility of Portuguesehostility. The object of these operations is to secure for ourselves the mostimportant economic outlet for the trade of Northern and Southern Rhodesia.In a recent telegramt General Smuts, who has been kept in touch with our projects in the Atlantic Islands, has pointed out: (a) That it would be difficult both for us and for him to defend such high-handed action against our old Ally, Portugal.(b) That our action against the Cape Verde Islands and the Azores mightforce the hand of the Governments of South Africa and of SouthernRhodesia into taking action against the railway in Portuguese EastAfrica.  This would be still more difficult to defend.8. An interim reply has been sent to General Smuts informing, him that,before any decisions are taken in the matter, the above points will be taken into full consideration. The necessity for maintaining General Smuts&apos; position in SouthAfrica needs no elaboration. Nevertheless, we feel that we should have a strong case to justify our action in the circumstances in which we recommend that the islands should be occupied, on the score that we could not afford to risk themfalling into enemy hands.Although we cannot expect our action to be accepted by the Portuguese withanything but resentment, particularly in view of our inability to protect Portugalagainst a possible attack by Germany through Spain, we suggest that it wouldbe condoned by the rest of the world and by the Dominions and even understood by Dr. Salazar. We should of course promise to return the islands to thePortuguese at the end of the war.If the above is accepted, there would be no cause for the Governments ofSouthern Rhodesia and South Africa to undertake operations in PortugueseEast Africa which are only designed to secure the railway in the event of activePortuguese hostility.The Military Problem.9. The Military problem in seizing the Cape Verde Islands and the Azorescan be summarised as follows :  .    .Cape Verde Islands.(a) The Portuguese defences consist of two batteries of naval guns of smallcalibre, and about 200 soldiers. Although these defences are weakwe must anticipate the possibility of their having been reinforced by German or Italian elements, particularly as we cannot seize these points until it is clear beyond reasonable doubt that Spain or Portugal(b) It will be necessary, in order to achieve surprise, to capture the two mostimportant islands, i.e., Sal and St. Vincent, simultaneously.(c) The forces required to ensure their capture are a brigade of two battalions with certain ancillary troops.propose to intervene* W.M. (40) 149th Conclusions, Minute 10.f Annex II.
Azores.&quot; &apos; i , ^w^-^ -\ -   &quot; .    . ,   ,   . ..(d) In the Azores there is a Portuguese garrison of two battalions and ninecoast defence guns. .(e) The forces allotted to the operation may not be sufficient to seize all the islands simultaneously if opposition is encountered. The Commanderhas been given the order of importance of objectives as follows: Horta.Porto del Garda.terceira.(/) To ensure the capture of the Islands a force of one infantry brigade withcertain ancillary troops is required.. 10. Provided that Naval patrols are established to prevent further reinforcements, we consider that the above forces are sufficient to capture the islands against opposition by the forces at present located there. In the eventof the operation becoming imminent, we intend to establish these Naval patrols.State of Planning.11. In the light of the above we have prepared plans on the following lines : (a) Two composite brigades, made up from four Royal Marine battalions and one army battalion, have been concentrated at Plymouth.(5) Shipping has been taken up and stores have either been loaded or moved to Liverpool, from which port it is intended the expeditions shouldsail.(c) The expeditions will be at 48 hours&apos; notice to sail, from the 18th July.(d) The Commanders of these brigades have been informed of their probabletask and instructed to prepare detailed plans. Naval Commanderswill be appointed as soon as the operations become imminent.Directives which it is proposed to issue to these Commanders are attached as Annex III.Recommendations.12.   We recommend- (a) that the War Cabinet should approve, in principle the circumstances inwhich we should seize the Cape Verde Islands and the Azores, viz. : (i) In the event of Spanish or Portuguese hostility,(ii) When it becomes clear beyond reasonable doubt that either ofthese Powers intends to intervene against us.(iii) If the exercise of economic pressure by control at source or control of shipping fails to achieve adequate results and wehave to rely more upon direct naval action.. Note. -There may be other circumstances, such as a german advance upon Portugal through Spain, in which a decision whether or not to seize the Islands would have to be madein the light of the situation at the time. In any event,the actual decision to despatch the expedition will lie withthe War Cabinet.(b) That the War Cabinet should give covering approval to the preparationswe have already made and which are outlined in paragraph 11 above and to the Draft Directives to Commanders attached as Annex III.(c) That the Dominions Office should be invited to inform General Smuts ofthe gist of the above plan if approved by the War Cabinet.(Signed) C.

ANNEX I.POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND STRATEGIC EFFECTS of portuguese AND SPANISH HOSTILITY.I. Portuguese Hostility.Political.1. If we were to decide to seize the Portuguese Islands on account of spanish hostility we should have a strong case to justify our action, on the scorethat there would be a grave risk of their falling into enemy hands. It would be far more difficult to make a tenable case for seizing them if France only were hostile. German propaganda would immediately exploit the situation and might prove most dangerous in South America and South Africa.2. Control of raw materials at the source is one of the chief methods onwhich we rely to defeat Germany. We have not yet achieved this control, and much will depend upon the results of the forthcoming Pan-American Conference:Nevertheless, we understand from the Ministry of Economic Warfare that theprospects are good. An act of aggression against Portugal, however, might-well have a disastrous effect on President Roosevelt&apos;s efforts to attain Pan-Americancollaboration in our favour, and our occupation of the Islands would notcompensate for a resulting failure to achieve this essential part of our planning.3. General Smuts has already pointed out* that it would be most difhcuitfor him to defend such high-handed action against our old Ally, Portugal. Hemakes this point on the assumption that it is our intention to seize these Islandsonly in the event of Spanish hostility. His reactions to any suggestion that we might seize them as a result of French hostility, when the attitude of Spain and portugal might not be in question, will presumably be still more adverse.Economic.4. Apart from its effect on South America and South Africa, Portuguesehostility would have no serious economic effect on our own war effort.Strategic.5. We have already reported! on the operations that would be necessaryin the event of Portuguese hostility in Portuguese East Africa, to secure an outletto the sea for the trade of the Rhodesias and the Belgian Congo, and, inparticular, the export of copper. These operations are to be undertaken to alarge extent by troops from the Union of South Africa. General Smuts haspointed out that he would be embarrassed politically if these operations were forced upon him as the result of an unprovoked attack upon Portugal by thiscountry. It is unnecessary to elaborate the importance to the Empire of main-taining General Smuts&apos;s position in the Union of South Africa.6. The Japanese have recently shown considerable interest in the Portugueseoccupation of the Island of Timor, where they have been afforded certain con-cessions. If we had already seized Portuguese possessions in the Atlantic wecould not very well protest against similar Japanese action in the Pacific, althoughsuch action would clearly be prejudicial to our own interests.II. Spanish Hostility.Political. .....7. There are at present signs that General Franco is determined to main-tain a fair attitude of neutrality. Dr. Salazar&apos;s considerable influence on general Franco has been constantly exerted to this end. We should thereforeprejudice the whole of our policy in the Iberian Peninsula if, as a result ofour seizing the Cape Verde Islands and the Azores, Spain were to be draggedinto the war. Moreover, as General Smuts indicates, such action on our part would place us on a moral plane with our enemies, and would be likely to haveAnnex II.f W.p. (40) 180.
a considerable psychological effect on opinion in the Western Hemisphere andin the Dominions.8. If Spain were to be dragged into the war as the result of unprovoked aggression on our part, the effect on the South American Republics would beadverse and our ability to control raw materials at source would thereby be seriously prejudiced.Economic.9. Although there might be some economic advantage in Spanish hostility,in that the blockade of Spain would deprive Europe of a lung, the economicdisadvantages of war with Spain are considerable. Our supply of Spanish north african ore is already seriously threatened and even the loss of the small supply from the Spanish mainland is to be avoided if possible. We should have to turn to very distant sources for our supplies of phosphate rock and copper pyritesand we should have to husband outf supplies of mercury very carefully........r;    ;;&apos;:&apos;.va:.&apos;; ;.-   i/v   -&apos; ;Strategic.10. The main strategic result of Spain joining our enemies would be that italian and German forces would be able to operate from bases in Spain, theCanaries, and the Rio de Oro against our sea communications in the atlantic and Western Approaches.Conclusions on the Effects of Spanish and Portuguese Hostility.11. The general conclusions to be drawn from the above review of Spanishand Portuguese hostility are as follows :  (a) The political repercussions of an act of unprovoked aggression mighthave serious results, particularly in South America, and might thusseriously prejudice our chance of obtaining Pan-American co-opera-tion in our plans to control commodities at source. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that upon this control we rely largely for winningthe war.(b) If we provoked Portuguese hostility the Governments of South africa and Southern Rhodesia might be forced to undertake operations in portuguese East Africa. General Smuts anticipates great difficultyin defending such an act of aggression.* The necessity for main-taining General Smuts&apos; position in South Africa needs no elaboration.(c) We should provide the Japanese with a pretext for intervention in Timor.(d) We should be deliberately discarding our present policy of encouragingGeneral Franco to adopt an attitude of neutrality, although this isat present showing some prospects of success.(e) Although our blockade of Europe might in consequence become more effective, we should be accepting economic disadvantages which are considerable.(/) Italian and German forces would be able to operate from bases in Spain,the Canaries and Rio de Oro.ANNEX II.Cypher Telegram from the United Kingdom High Commissioner in the Union ofSouth Africa, dated July 9, 1940. (Received 10-39 p.m. July 9, 1940.)(NO.- 397.   Most Secret.   Immediate.)YOUR telegram Circular Z, No. 178 of 8th July.In discussion of to-day General Smuts said that, having regard to the generalfriendliness of Portugal (as instructed by the reception of the Duke of Kent&apos;party, see your telegram No. 271) and to the ancient Treaty of Alliance, he feltgrave doubts about the wisdom, immmediately on the entry of Spain into the warAnnex II.
and irrespective of Portugal&apos;s attitude, of taking-action described in paragraph 4.In his view such&apos; action would be far more difficult to defend than action againstthe French Fleet at Oran and Dakar, -which was defensible. After all, our wholecase in this war rested upon moral grounds, which it was unwise to treat lightly,and the world&apos;s judgment,; both now and after the war, was of the greatest importance. -     :Smuts also felt that he would have difficulty in defending in South; Africawhat he could not help thinking would be widely regarded as high-handed action by the United Kingdom, whereby delay of day or two after the entry of Spain intothe war, during which the probable course of events and the attitude of Portugalwould almost certainly become clear, might make all the difference to the moralaspects.Moreover, he could not overlook the bearing of the matter on the contemplatedaction by the Union of Southern Rhodesia (see my telegram No. 341 of the30th June). It had been agreed that neither Government w*ould move againstPortuguese East Africa except on receipt of the special authorising telegram oron the announcement of the outbreak of wTar with Portugal (see your telegramNo. 245 of the 25th June). Course outlined in your telegram Z No. 178 might wellmean that the Union and Southern Rhodesia would be asked or forced to takealmost simultaneous action; General Smuts would then have to defend not onlythe action of the United Kingdom but also his own. This he would find very embarrassing. In the light of the above, Smuts was obviously doubtful whetherit would be wise at this stage to communicate information in your telegram ZNo. 178 to Southern Rhodesia (see my telegram No. 392).ANNEX III.Part 1: Draft Directive for Preparation of Plans by Officer Commanding2nd Royal Marine Brigade. -YOU have been selected to command the land forces detailed for operations in the Cape Verde Islands if it is decided to occupy these Portuguese Islands.2.   The object of the operations will be : To occupy the Cape Verde Islands so as to deny them to the enemy andto secure the cable station at St. Vincent.Facilities which the enemy might wish to make use of are the harbour at st.. Vincent, the aerodrome in Sal and landing grounds in Maio and St. Jago.3.   Your force will consist of : &apos;Two battalions of Royal Marines and attached troops.Details of this force wall be communicated to you separately.4. You will take immediate command of this force and will be responsiblefor planning in connection with the operation in conjunction with the navaladvisers, who have already been detailed by the Admiralty to represent the naval commander until such time as the latter joins the expedition. In making yourplans you should obtain any information and assistance you may require fromthe Director of Combined Operations, the Inter-Services Planning Staff and theService Departments concerned.5. The command of the Operation, until your forces are established ashore,will be exercised jointly by the Naval and Military Commanders in accordancewith paragraph 1 (i) of Chapter 4 of the Manual of Combined Operations, 1938.6. As the forces allotted to this Operation may not be sufficient to seize allthe Cape Verde Islands simultaneously if opposition is encountered, your firstact should be to capture St. Vincent and Sal Islands. Subsequently, you should deal with Maio and St. Jago.7. Since this Operation will probably be ordered without our being at warwith Portugal, it is to be hoped that, unless enemy forces have already succeeded
in establishing themselves, the local authorities will submitfto the occupation oftheir islands by British Forces when faced with a demand to that effect backed by force majeure. As the success of the Operation depends upon surprise, itwill not be possible to give any earlier warning of our intention.8. It is most important that secrecy regarding these projected operations should be preserved and knowledge of the destination of the expedition shouldbe confined to your immediate Staff.Part 2.: Draft Directive for Preparation of Plans by OfficerCommanding 1st Royal Marine Brigade.You have been selected to command the land forces detailed for operations in the Azores if it is decided to occupy these Portuguese Islands.2.   The object of the operations will be : To deny to the enemy the harbours of Horta (Fayal) and Ponta del Garda(San Miguel) and the potential landing grounds in Terceira; to secure these harbours and potential landing grounds for our own use; and to securethe Cable Station at Horta.3.   Your force will consist of : Two battalions of Royal Marines,8th Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and attached troops.Details of this force will be communicated to you separately.4. You will take immediate command of this force and will be responsiblefor planning in connection with this operation in conjunction with the navaladvisers who have already been detailed by the Admiralty to represent theNaval Commander until such time as the latter joins the expedition. In makingyour plans you should obtain any information and assistance you may requirefrom the Director of Combined Operations, the Inter-Services Planning Staff,and the Service departments concerned.5. Command of the operation until your forces are established ashore willbe exercised jointly by the Naval and Military Commanders in accordance with paragraph 1 (i) of Chapter 4 of the Manual of Combined Operations, 1938.6. The forces allotted to this operation may not be sufficient to seize allthe islands simultaneously if opposition is encountered. The order of importanceof the objectives is as follows : (i) Harbour, seaplane station, and cable station at Horta.(ii) Harbour at Ponta del Garda.(iii) Potential landing grounds in Terceira.7. Since this operation will probably be ordered without our being at warwith Portugal, it is to be hoped that, unless enemy forces have already succeeded in establishing themselves, the local authorities will submit to the occupationof their islands by British forces when faced with a demand to that effect backed by force majeure. As the success of the operation depends on surprise it willnot be possible to give any earlier warning of our intention.8. It is most important that secrecy regarding these projected operations should be preserved and knowledge of the destination of the expedition shouldbe confined to your immediate Staff.
