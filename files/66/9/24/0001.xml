(40)344.4TH JULY.  1940oWAR SABIWET.IMMINENCE OF A GERMAN INVASION OF GREAT BRITAIN.Re-port by the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee.In accordance with the instructi on vof the PrimeMinister we have had under urgent consideration thequestion of the imminence of a German invasion of GreatBritain.2. On 1st July we considered, in Paper No. \T. I. C. (40)1,44*.what was likely to be&apos;Germany&apos;s next move&quot; now that france has collapsed.      Our view was that there is atpresent little direct evidence to indicate what this nextmove is likely to be,  and Germany&apos;s military superiorityis such as to enable her to move in any direction shepleases with little ^r no warning.      Since that date wehave had little further conclusive evidence.3. Assuming however that Germany&apos;s next move will takethe form of an invasion, we have examined all the evidence available as to the likelihood and imminence of such an invasion.      This evidence is attached in Appendix &quot;A&quot;.4o We are satisfied from this evidence that Germany is making preparation for raids in force,  or for invasion ofthe British Isles.      In view of the fact that these prepara-tions are well advanced Germany may well move at any time at a date most suitable to her.      The evidence availablehowever, suggests that Germany&apos;s.full strength will not be developed until 15th July.5. We must point out however, that some of the evidencecontained in Appendix &quot;*A&quot; is capable of more than oneinterpretation.      Furthermore, the question of Germany&apos;s immediate action is much confused by the fliod of tendentiousreports and propaganda which are being deliberately putabout.CONCLUSIONS.6. We consider that large-scale raids, on the British Islesinvolving all three arms, may take place at any moment.    .A full-scaleinvasion is unlikely to take place before the middle ofJuly.      This matter is under our daily review.(Signed)     V.F.W.  CAVENDISH-BENTINGK.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.4TH JULY,  1940.J.N.   GODFREY.F.G.  BEAUMONT-NESBITT.A.R.  BOYLE.
