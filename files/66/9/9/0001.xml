THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.BC RET.^40) 289.th June,1940.WAR    CABINET.Copy No. ZLOTHE STRATEGICAL OUTLOOK.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,I circulate, for the information of the War Cabinet;copies of telegrams recently exchanged between thePrime Minister and General Smuts. &apos;C.Downing Street,28th June,  1940,General Smuts to Mr. ChurchillReceived 9.15 p.m. 22nd June, 1940.Situation which has developed for the British Empirethrough the collapse of France calls for careful review,&quot;  Insequel I summarise broad results of my cogitations and war policy for Empire which I would submit for consideration.1.      Europe has for the rest of this war ceased to be awar theatre on any large scale.     Vast armies formed to fight in that theatre are now surplus.     Fresh troops for that theatre on either side are not wanted.   British forces arenot wanted there, nor is there a call for manhood of north america.     Russia is not likely to provoke the Germancolossus.      The vast German Army is therefore also surplus.What is going to be done with it?     That is the real problem to consider.2.     Great Britain now becomes a vast fortress.     If herdefence is properly prepared and skilfully conducted, she will prove an impregnable fortress,  and attacks on her will weardown the German power until it cracks and crashes.     If her seapower
power heaps the Atlantic sea routes open and. America continuesa sure base of supplies of aircraft, munitions and small seacraft and raw materials and foodstuffs, I do not see how she can he &quot;beaten.      She will probably have more or as much manpower for defence as may be wanted.     Her military forces may possibly prove too large.      I think that with fair luck andnot counting disastrous mistakes,  she will weather the storm.The chances are greatly in her favour in this respect.3-        But what of herJUmpire and Dominions?     Great Britainherself may win through but lose her Empire&quot;and Commonwealth. *While wanning on inner front she may be beaten on Empire and World front. -This was what happened to. the &quot;Pr e nc h . E m p. i.r.e  in18 th ..Cent u.r y. &quot;France won on home &quot;front but lost Empire in asia and America to Britain.      Is this story going to be repeated in the case of Britain.      The risk is that Englanddominated by danger at home, which she will overcome,may losesight of larger situation which makes her the great worldpower which she is, and which&apos;is so essential to the futureof the world.4. This danger arises because of two important factorswhose possible effects must be (corrupt group) and (2 corruptgroups)  the one is surplus German army,  the other is Japan.5.      Japan in her present ?blind expansionist tempermay consider this the right moment to eliminate the Britishfactor from the Par East, Hong Kong, British interests inChina, French Indo-China and Burma, possibly Singapore,perhaps the Dutch east  Indies may all be considered fair prizesin this World crisis, which ties British hands in the East.To safeguard the immense British position (?possessions) in he Par East against the Japanese menace I would suggest thefollowing policy.     First Russia should be encouraged in alllegitimate ways to interest herself in this Far eastern situation.      British diplomacy will know best (?group omitted)to do this.Secondly and more important, a clear understandingshould be come to with the United States of America onsomewhat following lines.     The United States of America shouldnot be pressed to do more than supplying Britain with industrial and financial support and repealing the Cash and carry laws.      For the rest she should remain neutral, as herarmies are not wanted in Europe and her Navy is most wantedin the Pacific.      In her own interest she should hold herselfresponsible for French, Dutch and British interests in the far East, and ports and bases of these countries should befor this purpose.     In doing this she would be safeguardingher own position against Japanese menace.      Her contribution onthese lines would be politically easier for her and alsoin the line with her own vital interest.      And in protecting the interestSiof all these countries in the Far East she wouldnot appear to be particularly pro-English, but follow a broaddemocratic peace policy in the Par East.      It may even bepossible to arrive at an American-British-Russian undertakingfor the Pacific, which may effectively check Japaneseambitions.     British influence may thus be served in theFar East during this crisis and thereafter.End of Part I.      part II follows.-2-
6.     There remains menace of German army.      This army willhe there to use in new theatres of war.      where will these be?Two theatres have to be specially considered Africa and the balkans plus Near East.     Balkans and Near East will give oil(Eoumania Iraq) but will probably mean Balkan war Turkish warperhaps intervention of Russia.      I do not know enough to beable to evaluate this position.      In any case such a war wouldnot   distinctly and directly menace the Empire, apart fromapproach to?India;    it would however reach the Empire oil resources.7.     There remains Africa not as ,a.speculation but as acertainty.     Knowing Mediterranean situation permits germany will join Italy in North Africa,  conquer French Mediterraneancolonies,  capture Egypt and Suez and then begin to drive downAfrica until if. the war lasts long enough they have masteredthe African continent *      It will give Germany a vast tropicalempire,    gold and minerals of southern Africa and a strategic position -which will eventually mean world empire.    If bothEgypt and South Africa are lost India will also be lost and australia and New Zealand cut off to fall within American or japanese sphere in future.      Great Britain although savingherself, at home will cease to be a world power and a beneficial force.    Her essential supplies will be cut off.89     We have to face probability that French Mediterraneancolonies and. Egypt will be lost and Mediterranean route withthem.      But that would not be fatal so long as Africa southof the equator remains British.    Empire was founded and reached its zenith on Cape route not on later precarious Suez route.India Australia and the Far East all lie on this route which Ishighway of Maritime Empire.      Cape route also involves possessionof Southern Atlantic and Indian Ocean -ports.9.     To save Empire and Commonwealth it is therefore necessary to hold Africa south of&apos;the equator at all costs inthis war.      It is very rich in tropical and mineral resources apartfran its strategical position. But it is poor in European man power andin defence.    Even if we had men here we have no guns munitionstanks aircraft to be a real foimiidable deterrent to axis powers.But we have no men although what we have is exceptionally good.With a number of British or Dominion divisions flung in timeinto West and East Africa to assist the effort of South africa and with proper air guns equipment sea power to support usSouthern Africa ought to hold out against very powerful axisforces to the end of the war Britain would thus arrive at thepost with her Empire virtually intact.10.    War policy.    I would therefore press with all my force for supply of above munitions to southern African as soon aspossible.     War effort should not be concentrated to the excesson Great Britain which will in all probability prove impregnable0Nor will many millions of men be reqizired for so small and highlyfortified an area.      There ought to be divisions especiallyDominion and Colonial to spare and sufficient armaments for(?other omitted)places.11.    Air expansion of bouth Africa alone could be very largeif we could get training and other machines for which we have beencrying ourselves hoarse;    even Brooke Popham&apos;s visit has had little result.    Young men are keen and exceptionally fine material.Guns munitions and tanks in quantities which would not make the slightest difference to Great Britain would make all difference in Africa and;probably save the Empire at this vital&apos; point.Southern Africa is not a side show but a vital area of the Empire,And even at this late hour I would urge that its claim to proper-defence equipment be considered.   Whole of European War situation has changed and brought this aspect of Imperial Defence right intocentre of the picture.    I pray it may now be given proper attention-
Mr. Churchill to General Smuts.Despatched 3 p.m.    27th June,  1940.Obvioiisly we have first to repulse any attack on GreatBritain by invasion,  and show ourselves able to maintain ourdevelopment    of Air Power.      This can only be settled by trial.If Hitler fails to beat us here, he will probably recoileastwards.      Indeed he may do this even without trying invasion,to find employment for his Army,  and take the edge off the winterstrain upon him.2.      I do not expect winter strain will prove decisive, butto try to hold all Europe down in a starving condition with onlyGestapo and military occupation and no large theme appealingto masses is not an arrangement which can last long.3.     Development of our Air power particularly in regionsunaffected by bombing,  should cause him ever increasing cifficul-ties, possibly decisive difficulties,  in Germany,  no matter whatsuccesses he has  in Europe or Asia.4.      Our large Army now being created for hone defence isbeing formed on principle of attack and opportunity for large scale offensive amphibious operations may come in 1940 and 1941.We are still working on 55 Division basis here, but as ourmunitions supply expands and Empire resources are mobilised,larger numbers may be possible.     After all we are now at last oninterior lines.      Hitler has vast hungry areas to defend and wehave the command of the seas.      Choice of objectives in western europe is therefore wide.5.      I send you these personal notes in order to keep inclosest contact with your1 thoughts which ever weigh with me.Part I ends..      Part II begins.Your paragraphs from 6 onwards subsequently received.We shall certainly give you all help in defending South Africa,but this would not be the moment to put British and DominionsDivisions into West or East Africa,  and I do not see how they couldbe used or maintained il they got there.     British eastern mediterranean fleet is well-placed to resist an attack on Egypt,as well as to cover east coast of Africa.      We can also sendforces from here by the Atlantic far quicker than any Germanforce can traverse the immense land distances of Africa,  ifindeed they are traversable except by very small numbers.Possibility of air attack on South Africa appears remote atpresent time.     We are attacking Germans ceaselessly and heavilyin their homeland, and are also being attacked ourselves,  so farin a very unskilful fashion.It. would not be right to make any considerabledetachment of Air Forces from Great Britain until we see what happens in the main trial of air strength now impending here.
