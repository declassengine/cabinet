On the 25th June the War Cabinet authorised me (Conclusions181 (ko).)    to apply Contraband Control to all parts of continentalPrance.       It was intended to prevent all contraband goods   from reaching France, on the presumption that any such goods would be liable to fall into the hands of the enemy.     No reference was(made, however, to the French Colonies and Overseas possessionssince it was then obviously desirable to do nothing which mightjjdeter them from continuing their resistance to the enemy; nor didII then think it necessary to seek authority to apply export controljto goods of French origin.!2. For some time no vessel has sailed, or attempted to sail;through the Mediterranean to North African ports, but a number offenquiries whether shipments would be allowed to proceed to thoseports or to Casablanca have been received and it is desirableI that we should now be able to give neutral commercial interests[explicit guidance-      Further, it has now been decided,    on   theJinitiative of the Board of Trade, to treat, not only the whole offcontinental France, but also French Morocco, Algeria and Tunis as-enemy territory for the purpose of the Trading with the Enemy Act.I, therefore, propose j^i)rthalow be applied to all ships, whether)orts in French Morocco, Algeria and-destined for such ports should be rel(ii) that ships from ports in thesei1 ranee should be subjected to Enemy)  French origin or ownership shouldadvised that no new Order-in-Councilt Contraband Control shouldFrench or neutral, bound forTunis, and that all goodsgarded as liable to seizure;territories or in continentalExport Control, and that goodsbe liable to seizure/ \ I amwould be required.The presumption that goods reaching the French Northterritories will, in every case, fall into enemy hands, is^resent not so strong as&apos;&apos;ranoe.
