S E C R E T.C.O.S.  (40) 495-........ COPY NO.S7TH JUNE. 1940.WAR CABINET.CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE.HOME DEFENCE.Memorandum*+   At the Meeting of the Chiefs of Staff on the 25thJune   the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, explained to us the general outline plan for the defence of this country against invasion.2. As we interpret it, the Commander-in-Chief1sexposition of the plan was as follows.There were three main elements in the defence -(i)    A &quot;crust&quot; on the coast with local reserves tomove and fight the enemy on the&apos; beachwherever he may attempt c, landing.(ii)    A line of anti-tank obstacles running down thecentre of England to the Blackwall Tunnel,thence tc Maidstone and southward to thesea.(iii)    Mobile reserves in rear of this anti-tank linewhose role is to strike ct the enemyeither on the beach or wherever he may havepenetrated.5. We have now had an opportunity of considering theabove outline plan in the light of a more detailed apprecja-tion by the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, setting outthe G-.H.Q. policy for Home Defence (.G.H.Q. OperationInstruction No. 3)-      There are certain general points which we should like to discuss further with theC cmmsinder-in-C chief *+    CCS.   (40) 193rd Conclusions, Minute 2.

4. The following comments are concerned mainly with,the plan of defence set out in paragraphs 13 and 14 ofthe Operation Instruction referred to above, and for convenience of reference, we have attached a copy ofthese paragraphs as an Annex.5. The plan of defence, as set out in these two paragraphs, appears to us to be generally sound.     Never-theless, we are not entirely satisfied that sufficientemphasis has been laid upon the paramount necessity of resisting the enemyp by all means in our power, during that vital first phase in the operations where he willbe most vulerable, i.e. during the process of disembark-ation on the beaches.6. It is during the period of the final approach andof the disembarkation that our air forces will hope to deliver a heavy scale of attack without fear of endanger-ing the lives of our own forces or of the civilpopulation.7 *        Although our interpretation of the explanation bythe Commander-in-Chief, and of the operation orders, maynot be entirely correct, we have formed the impression that the term &quot;crust&quot; or &quot;outpost&quot;, when applied   to thedefence of our shores, is liable to misconception anddanger.     A defence, which is termed a &quot;crust&quot;, implies that it is expected to be broken, while an outpost isindicative of thinly held posts from which retirement is permissible under pressure.8. We fully appreciate that it will be impossible inthe time available^    and with the forces at the Commander-in-Chief&apos;s disposal, to make impregnable the whole coast-line on which a landing might be attempted, especially asair-borne landings on a considerable scale must also beguarded against.     Nevertheless, we feel that thebalance of our defence, as the plan has been explained tous, may lean too far on the side of a thinly held &quot;crust&quot;on the coast, with insufficient mobile reserves in theimmediate vicinity of the points at which penetrationmight occur.9. We are not clear as to the location of reserves.While the position of London and the need for space fordeployment in any required direction necessitates theretention some way inland of the main reserves, yet theneed for immediate counter attack against any penetrationsis paramount, and troops so situated as the main reservesmay take an unduly long time in coming into action.Consequently we are anxious for an assurance, thatbearing in mind the total forces available, there is asufficient proportion available as local reserves inclose support of the Loops on the coast to hold theinvader until the main reserves can intervene.-2-

We are apprehensive that the time taken for thesemobile reserves to reach points at which the enemy havepenetrated the coastal defended zone may be unduly long.We fully agree that having regard to the limited forces available our main reserves must not be concentrated tooclose to the coast0     Nevertheless, we are not entirelysatisfied that the present location of the main reservesis sufficiently far forward to enable them effectively to counter a penetration of the forward defences.10.      There is a final point on the question of communica-tions to which we invite attention.     Paragraphs 30 and31 of the Operation Order described the wireless and broadcasting arrangements for inter-communication.      Thearrangements for broadcasting were, we understand,drawn up as a result of inter-departmental discussion.We should like to be assured that these arrangementshold good,  since we are of the opinion that in theconfusion which is bound to be incidental to an invasion of this country accompanied by a heavy scale of air attack and the landing of parachute troops, the normal meansof communication other than by wireless cannot be relied upon.(Signed)    C.L.N.  NEWALL.&quot; DUDLEY POUND.&quot; JOHN DILL.Terrace, S.W.I.,

AH HEX.PLAN OF DEFENCE.15.&apos;        The general plan of defence is a combination ofmobile columns and static defence by means of strong points and &quot;stops&quot;.     As static defence only provides limitedprotection of the most vulnerable points, it must be supple-mented by the action of mobile columns.     However mobile suchcolumns may be they cannot be expected to operate immediatelyover the whole area in which it is possible for the enemy to attempt invasion by sea or air.      It is, therefore,necessary to adopt measures for confining his action until such time as mobile columns can arrive to deal with him.This will be done by means of &quot;stops&quot; and strong pointsprepared for all round defence at aerodromes which are necessaryto prevent the enemy obtaining air superiority, at the maincentres of communication, and distributed in depth over a wide area covering London and the centres of production and supply.      This system of &quot;stops&quot; and astrong points will prevent the enemy from running riot and   tearing the guts cut of the country as has happened in France and Belgium.14.      Coastal Area.      This should be regarded as an outpostzone, to give warning of, to delay and break up the initialattack.     Attempts to approach the Ports and Beaches intransports, and the disembarkation therefrom, will be ham-hampered by the Fixed Defences, but these defences will require tobe supplemented by ether defence weapons,  such as lighterartillery, small arms, mines etc. for their local protection.Since our resources vcill not     permit the occupationof defensive positions to cover all possible landing beacheswith fire, the defence of the latter will be c refined tothose which lend themselves to a landing in force KithA.P.Vs, particularly those which give access to importantports, or objectives inland.These beach defences will be reinforced by strong points in rear, designed primarily to hold up enemy A.F.V.rs,and giving facilities for all round defence.     Similarly,ports r;ill be protected by all round defence,The principle must be to obtain earl;/ infornaticnand to hold mobile Reserves ready to move to the threatenedpoints and to attack the enemy.

SECRET.CCS.(40)498. COPY NO.28TH JUNE.  194Q.WAR CABINET.CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE.Note by the Secretary.The following note by the Prime Minister is circulated for consideration by the Chiefs of Staff atthe meeting to be held on Saturday, 29th June,  1940 atwhich the Cormandexwba^Qnxe-^^ Home-for-ce-s wxlX-fce present.(Signed)    L.C HOLLIS.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.ENCLOSURE.10, DOWNING- STREET,WHITEHALL,  S.W.1.Note by the Prime Minister tothe Chiefs of Staff Committee.HOME. DEFENCE.1. It is prudent to block off likely sections of the beaches with a good defence and to make secure a3.1 creeksand harbours on the East Coast.      The South Coast Is lessimmediately dangerous.      No serious invasion is possible without a harbour with its quays, etc.      No-one can tell,

should^biie^-N-avy fail, on what part of the East Coast the impact will fall.      perhaps there will be several lodgments.Once these are made all troops employed on other parts ofthe coastal crust will be as useless as those in theMaginot Line.      Although fighting on the beaches isfavourable to the defence, this advantage cannot be purchased by trying to guard all the beaches.      Processmust be selective.      But if time permits defended sectorsmay be widened and improved.2, Every effort should be made to man coast defenceswith sedentary troops, well-sprinkled with experiencedlate-war officers.      The safety of the country depends onhaving a large number (now only nine but should soon befifteen)   &apos;Leopard&apos; brigade-groups which can be directedswiftly,  i.e. within four hours. to the points of lodgment.Difficulties of landing on beaches are serious, even wheninvader has reached them;    but. difficulties of nourishinga lodgment when exposed to heavy attack by land,  air and sea arc far greater.      All therefore depends on rapid,resolute engagement of any landed forces which may slipthrough the sea-control.      This should not be beyond ourmeans provided the field troops are not consumed in beachdefences, aid are kept in high condition of mobility,crouched and ready to spring.3.. In the unhappy event of the enemy capturing a portlarger formations with artillery will be necessary.    Thereshould be four or five good divisions held in general reserve to deal with such an improbable   misfortune.    The&apos;scale of lodgment to be anticipated should be not morethan ten thousand men landed at three points simultaneous-ly,  say thirty thousand in all.      The scale of air attacknot more than fifteen thousand landed simultaneously at two or three points in all.      The enemy will not havestrength to repeat such descents often.      It is very doubtful whether air-borne troops can be landed in force by night;    by day they should be an easy prey to air attack.4, The tank story is somewhat different and it is right to minimise by local.cannon and obstacles the landing-places of tanks.      The Admiralty should report uponthe size, character and speed of potential tank-carryingbarges or floats, whether they will be self-propelled ortowed and by what craft.      As they can hardly go aboveseven miles an hour they should be detected, in summer-time after they have started,  and even in fog or haze theR.D.F.  stations should give warning while they are stillseveral hours from land.      The destroyers issuing from thesally-ports must strike at these with gusto.      Thearrangement of stops and blocks held by local sedentaryforces should be steadily developed,  and anti-tank squadsformed.      Our own tank reserve must engage the survivinginvader tanks,  and no doubt is held in a position whichallows swift railing to the attacked area.5.. Parachutists, Fifth-Columnists and enemy motor-cyclists who m^y jj^i^Lrate or appear in disguise inunexpected places must be left to the home guard, re-inforced by special squads.      Much thought must be givento the trick of wearing British uniform.

6. In general I find myself in agreement with theCommander-in-Chief&apos;s plan, but all possible field-troopsmust be saved from the beaches and gathered into thefLeopard&apos; brigades and other immediate mobile supports.Emphasis should be laid upon the main reserve.      the battle will be won&apos;or lost not on the beaches, but by the mobile brigades and the main reserve.      Until theAir Force is worn down by prolonged air fighting and destruction of aircraft supply,  the power of the Navyremains decisive against any serious invasion.7. The above observations apply only to the immediatesummer months. We must be much better equipped end strongerbefore the autumn.(Intiailed)   W.S.C.28.  6. 4-0.

SECRET.0.0.8.(40.)   500.28TH JUNE.  1940. COPY NO..WAR CABINET.CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE.HOME DEFENCE.The following notes by Lord Hankey are circulatedby the direction of the Prime Minister for considerationby the Chiefs of Staff on Saturday, 29th June, 1940, inaddition to the note by the Prime Minister issued asPaper No.  0.0.8.(40)  498.(Signed)    L.C. HOLLIS.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.ENCLOSURE.HOME DEFENCE..Notes by Lord Hankey.1. It is assumed that the general scheme of Home Defence,is correctly summarised as follows(i) The general policy of Home Defence is to attack the enemy so far as possible from the moment whenhis preparations are discovered;    during the voyageby sea or air, if he succeeds in starting;    in theact of landing (which must be prevented if possible);and after landing until the forces are completelydestroyedo(ii) The duty of the Secret Service is to obtain allthe information they can bearing on German plans for attacking this country,    and preparations suchas concentrations of troops,  sea transport,  carrierand other aircraft.(iii) The   first duty of the Air Force is by continuousreconnaissance to obtain the fullest possible information about concentrations of troops, sea transport, carrier and other aircraft.

(iv) The    second, duty of the Air Force in Home defence is to attack concentrations of sea transport orcarrier and other aircraft as soon after they arediscovered as possible, and if practicable to bombthe concentrations of troops.(v) The first duty of the Navy also is reconnaissance,but their capacity for this is rather limitedcompared with the Royal Air Force.      Their secondduty is to attack the enemy&apos;s transports andescorts with all the means at their disposal at theearliest possible moment at which they can be located at sea and throughout the voyage.(vi) On arrival at ports or beaches it is the duty ofthe Officer Commanding to send the fullest information at the earliest possible moment to the Commander-1-in-Chief, Home Defence.      It is the duty of the AirForce to supplement this information to the best of its ability,(vii) The beaches and ports are the main line of defenceof this country,  and the enemy must be repulsedthere by all possible means.      The land forces on thebeach will usually be rather th;&apos;,;v.      Their action must be supplemented as soon as possible by action by Naval forces and by Air Forces, which latter can be most quickly on the spot.      Even if the Air Forcecannot prevent the operation of landing, they can do much to shatter the morale of the would-be invader.As both feints and.real attempts at landing may benumerous,    all three Services must be careful aboutthrowing.in their reserves too soon.(viii) If a landing is effected and especially if largenumbers of armoured fighting vehicles are put onshore, they must be attacked furiously by the Armyand Air Force.      Eusort must be made to every kindof ambush and trap.2, The following are some of the points that requireprobing:-(a) The details of Royal Air Force reconnaissances shouldbe examined to ensure that they are comprehensive.(Secret Service is at present rather limited owingto difficulties of communication),(b) It is essential that the Staff machinery shouldbe   tuned to such a point (if this is not already the case)  that at any time during the day or nightprompt decisions can be taken as to operations onthe receipt of any reliable intelligence.(c) The Naval Staff should be asked to submit daily tothe Prime Minister (for examination by someone in hisconfidence) particulars of all surface and submarinevessels available to resist invasion or raids.(d) The   Air Staff should be asked to report thearrangements at the different aerodromes forresisting attacks by parachutists and,troops landedfrom carrier aircraft..

(e) The arrangements for   ensuring early action at a landing place by the Navy and Air Force,including fighter protection at ports orbeaches5 should be closely investigated.(f) The arrangements for ensuring coimiunicationsin the event of the interruption of landtelegraphs and telephones, whether by bombing, parachutists or Fifth Columnactivities, between the different Servicesand between the Headquarters of those Servicesand their local commands, should be investi-*gated, e.g0War Office and Commander-in^Chief, HomeDefence0Commander-in-Chief, Home Defence, and hissubordinate commands right down the chain of command to the beachesoCommander-in-Chief, Home Defence, and bomber command and   Fighter   Command right down tothe squadronsaCommander-in-Chief, Home Defence and Admiralty.Admiralty and the Naval Commanders-in-chief and fleets and squadrons at sea (e.g.  inthe event of the Admiralty wireless being destroyed).27th June, 1940.

SECRET.CCS. (40) 502. COPY NO.28TH JUNE. .1940.WAR CABINETCHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE.HOME DEFENCE.Note &quot;by the Secretary.In the course of a conversation between the foreign secretary and the Polish Foreign Minister, the lattersuggested that the Germans planned to launch an attack against this country on 8th July, or thereabouts.      TheGerman plan was based on a system of mining the Channelin such a way as to make it very difficult for the british fleet to stop the troop transports which would sail along-a small channel between two barrages of mines.2. The Prime Minister minuted as follows:-&quot;     It seems difficult to believe that any largeforce of transports could be brought to theChannel ports without our being aware of it, or that any system of mining would prevent oursweepers from clearing a way for attack on suchtransports on passage.      However, it would be wellif the Chiefs of Staff gave their attention tothis rumour.(Intd.) W.S.C.       27-6.40. 1J. It is suggested that the best form which a replyto the Prime Minister&apos;s Note could take would be astatement of the arrangements made to ensure that thepresence of a large force of transports would becomeimmediately known, and the naval dispositions which wouldenable an attack of the type suggested to be dealt with,if it occurred about the date proposed.(Signed) L.C.

C.0.S.(40) 495, 498, 500 and 502).(Previous reference; C,0.S.(40) 196th Meeting).THE COMMITTEE first discussed with theCommander-in-Chief, Home Forces, their Memorandum(Paper No. C.0.S.(40 ) 495) dealing with certain aspects of the general plan for the employment of theland forces against an invasion of the United Kingdom.^ Snc^of SIR EDMUND IRONSIDE said that it was certainly  acnes. true that the divisions holding the beaches had very few troops indeed disposed in depth as local&apos; reserves.It had, however, been made quite clear in theoperation instructions issued by G.H.Q., Home Forces,that there was to be no withdrawal from the beachdefences and that the troops in them were to fight it out where they stood.      The battalions holding these

defences were, of course, disposed in depth to someextent, but they had very wide fronts to cover0     Theywould have their Bren carriers as a small mobileforce for immediate counter attackf &apos;fet the majorityof the divisions in the line were only partiallytrained and had very little artillery,     Formationsin this condition were unsuitable for counter attacks on a large scale,  and in these circumstances therewould be little advantage in keeping larger localreserves for counter attacks      The allocation oftroops to beaches had been very carefully considered in relation to the probability of landings vipon them.Where for navigational reasons such landings wereimprobable, even though the   beaches themselves mightbe good landing places, troops were economised as muchas possible,-,      &apos;Jhe construction of beach defenceswas progressing well, and anti-tank obstacles had beenerected at all places where tanks were likely to land.These were being supplemented by wire entanglementsas quickly as possible.,      The defensive position onthe coast would be much more than a crust within avery short time as these defences were completed and strengthened^e A considerable proportion of the total forces8. available had to be kept as mobile reserves inlandin order to deal not only with landings by sea butalso air landings,  of which we were likely to get nowarning at alla       The whole layout of the defences had therefore to be related to the menace of air-bornetroops as well as of a sea-borne expedition.      Thecentral reserve was in two main groups, :.;achconsisting of one division and one armoured division(the latter at present at very much reduced strength).These reserves could be moved within a. few hours tothreatened points,      In addition there were reserves in the hands of lower formations which could get tothe coast very much more quickly,      Ills own view wasthat the Germans would probably make one main landingby air and perhaps up to &quot;three landings by sea^      Theywould probably exploit whichever of these proved to bethe soft spot,.      If we had four armoured divisions inthe United Kingdom the whole problem of the defence ofthe country would be solved.j 2  The principle which was to be followed in dealingBg with   with an air-borne landing was to block all the roads0,&apos;&quot;&apos;: round the landing place as rapidly as possible, so asto hem the enemy in, and then deal with, him in thisenclosed area with mobile reserves,,      Everysearchlight had with it a small mobile detachment whose duty it was to block the roads in its vicinity.

?mii-pmentfl Arming of the Local Defence Volunteers was proceeding, hut only a proportion had so far receivedtheir weapons.      Large numbers of American rifles and ammunition would be available for distribution veryshorri-ly.     A stock of &quot;Molotov cocktails&quot; would bekept at every road block, for use by the Local defence volunteers or other troops holding ite      Millsgrenades were at present very short.     The otherchief shortage was in artillery;   Te&quot;y fev/divisions had even 60 per cent, of vheXx&apos;establishment of guns0&quot;;;nommunicaiionsoBroadcasting could not be used for the issue oforders, by higher formations at any rate, for reasons of secrecy.      It would, however, be employed for the dissemination of information.     The whole question of communications in Home Forces was at present under examination by the Signal Officer-in-ChiefcTHE COMMITTEE:(i) Agreed that the plan of defencedescribed by the Commander-in-Chief,Home Forces, covered the requirementslaid down in the Chiefs of staff memorandum (Paper No, CCS, (40) 495).( ii) Took note that the question of communications within Home forces was at present being re-examined.THE COMMITTEE then discussed the Note by thePrime Minister circulated as Paper No. C0.S,(40) 498.It was agreed that the plans of the Commander-in-Chiefwere in conformity with the views expressed by thePrime Minister in this Note.In the discussion the following points emerged:-Use of As described above, partially trained troopsSedentary unfitted for mobile operations were largely used to gQQbs for hold the beaches.     At some places, e,g. Cromer,iBeach R.A. S.C. were being employed to hold sectors of the^ once. beaches.

%&amp;SXQ8 &amp;M Six regiments of mechanised cavalry were organisedBrigade as highly mobile mechanised local reserves,-,      In the groups. event of an invasion the five independent companiesat present under the command of the Director of combined Operations would be put at the disposal ofthe Commander-in-Chief0SIR JOHN DILL undertook to informCommanderthe location of these units,Tank Tanks could only be transported on pontoon raftscarrying towed by tugs at slow speed in a very smooth sea.Transports.     The Germans had 800 tG 1,000 self-propelled bargescapable of 8 to 9 knots, which could carry tanks,but these again could only be used in very calmweather,,     A more likely method of landing tanks wouldbe to transport them in fast ships which would anchorin, say, 5 fathoms and then discharge tanks fitted withflotation gear.,      In specially fitted ships this couldbe done very rapidly, and the Japanese were known tohave used this methods     Such vessels would have to be specially   adapted,,      Germany had available about24 train ferries, each capable of carrying 20 to 30tanks.      These vessels, however, drew at least 13 feet,and without considerable modifications could notdischarge non-amphibious tanks direct to the beaches.Warning ofthe approach of a Sea-borneExpedition.R0D.F0 might detect the approach of the ships ofa sea-borne expedition up to 29 miles, but it would notbe safe to count on receiving any warning from thissourceo      There would probably be large numbers ofour own craft in the area which might make it difficultto identify the enemy,,      In certain conditions we might not get warning from the air of the approach of aninvading force,  and the first information might beobtained from the auxiliary patrols working only 8 to10 miles from the coast;,Use of Any Germans landing in disguise would almostBritish certainly be betrayed by their speech.      They would beUniform much less likely to succeed in deceiving    the troopsby the in this manner than they had been on the Continent.Bnemy. All the troops and L.D. Vs,  had been specially warned tobe very suspicious of ruses of this nature,,      Themethods which the Germans had used in Holland were beingclosely studied^      The possibility of false orders and information being given on the telephone had to be watched, but there was some safeguard in that officers on the various Headquarters could generally recognise the voices of other officers with whom they would becommunicatingc

There was some discussion on the possibility of introducing special distinguising marks to be wornby our own troops.SIR EDMUND IRONSIDE undertook to inform general Ismay of what was being done in this matterso that he could let the Prime Minister know.THE COMMITTEE next considered Lord Hankey&apos;sNotes on Home Defence (Paper No.   C.0.S.(40) 500).The following points emerged in the discussion:-Air Attack It was agreed that once the presence of enemy on Enemy concentrations of shipping prior to an invasion hadConeentrataons been established by air reconnaissance, the fullin German        weight of our air resources should be turned on toPorts. destroy them.Attack on The instructions issued to naval Commanders madeEnemy1s it clear that the destruction of the enemy&apos;sTransports.      transports was to be the primary objective, and not that of the escorting vessels.Qo-o-operation Each Army Command had one R.A. p.  station allottedbetween the to its support.      In addition there was, of course, anArmy and allotment of Army co-operation squadrons to, formationsthe Royal in the normal xmy0                            &quot;&quot;. &apos;&quot;&quot;*Air Force.With regard to the principal points raised inparagraph 2 of Paper No.  O.O.S.(40) 500, THE COMMITTEE: -(iii) Took note that the Assistant Chief ofNaval Staff and the Deputy Chief ofthe Air Staff were submitting afe report on the machinery for obtaining information of an impending invasionfrom air and sea reconnaissancesand other sources of information, andfor taking action on the receipt ofsuch intelligence to attack enemy concentrations and transports withsea and air forces.

(iv)  Invited the Chief of Naval staff to submit a note of the disposition of naval forces available to resistinvasion and of the instructions - -issued to the  Oomrnander-in-Chief ,Home Fleet, and local navalCommanders in thi(v) Agreed that a trial should be held ofthe arrangements and communicationsprovided for the advanced headquarters of the Commander--in-Chi ef, home forces,  in the Cabinet&apos;War Roomas early as possible, and took note that the  Commander-in-Chief would examine the possibility of thisadvanced headquarters being keptpermanently in commission;,(vi)  Took note that the whole question ofthe communications within Home forces,.and between        Q. .. Il-or-e Forces, and&quot;cSh? Services        at present underv .     -     : id 0. .-j &apos; - - s   (j.i)), and invited the Ooromander-in-Chief, HomeS\ v..as, to inform the Chiefs of Staffof the result of this review.(vii)  Invited the Chief of Naval Staff to review the arrangements for communication between the admiralty and naval Commanders-in-Chief and ships at sea, with particular reference to the possibility ofinterruption to the nor:?.al Admiraltywireless system.(SIR EDMUND IRONSIDE left the meeting at thispoint.)THE COMMITTEE next discussed a Note by theSecretary containing a Minute by the Prime Minister onthe possible use by the Germans of mines to protect the passage of their troop transports (Paper No.0.0. S.(40)  502).ADMIRAL POWER said that it was expected that theenemy would make extensive use of mines if he launchedan expedition against this country..      These mines were a very real menace, and we must expect to incurconsiderable losses.      The difficulty was thatminesweepers moved so very much more slowly thanwarships and could not therefore keep ahead of themwhile sweeping a channel0

THE COMMITTEE(viii) Invited the Naval Staff, in consultation as necessary with, the Air Staff, to study the question, of the extensiveuse of mines on the lines suggestedin the Prime Minister&apos;s Note and toensure that the necessary countermeasures were taken.X      X      X      X
