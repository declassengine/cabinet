THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY-S GOVERNMENTSECRET.W.P. (40) 289(Also Paper No. COS. (40) 554)July 19, 1940TO SE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 46)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 12 noon July 11th to12 noon July 18th,1940[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Cabinet War Room.
naval SITUATION.General Review.APART from air attacks on shipping, which have continued at about thesame intensity, there has been little enemy activity at sea, U-boat activity con-tinues to be slight.  Aircraft minelaying has continued on an increased scale.Indifferent weather conditions have hampered our air reconnaissance in home waters to some extent.Home Waters.2. On the 16th July a strong force of cruisers and destroyers carried out as weep to intercept an enemy force consisting of light forces and submarines,which had been reported in a position 80 miles west of Jutland in the early morning. No enemy ships having been sighted, the search was abandoned at1545.   At 1630 our ships were attacked by enemy aircraft without result.Two hours later a further air reconnaissance sighted 6 enemy submarinesto the westward of the area which had been swept, together with an escort of1 cruiser or destroyer and 12 small ships and accompanying aircraft, which had just left them and was retiring to the eastward. Our aircraft attackedunsuccessfully.3. Our own force was delayed by fog, and about midnight off DuncansbyHead H.M.S. Glasgow collided with H.M. Destroyer Imogen, which was floodedas far aft as the engine room and caught fire. Whilst the ships were lockedtogether the majority of the Imogen&apos;s crew were taken on board the Glasgow.Owing to the fire the Imogen had to be abandoned and is believed to have sunk.Glasgow sustained appreciable damage to her bows. One officer and one ratingfrom Glasgow are missing, and Imogen has 1 rating killed, 1 officer and 9 ratingswounded and 17 missing.Special destr-oyer hunting patrols have been established to intercept theU-boats sighted on the 16th July, but up to the present no contacts have beenreported.4. Suspicious vessels were reported to the westward of Ushant on the15th July, and a search was instituted with aircraft and naval forces, but nothing unusual was observed. Special patrols have been established off the southand west coasts of Ireland and in the North Channel to intercept U-boats and surface craft.H.M. Ships on convoy and patrol duty have on many occasions during theweek been attacked by enemy aircraft in the Channel and approaches, and off theEast Coast of England. On the 11th July H.M. Yacht Warrior II was sunk bya bomb off Portland; one rating was killed and two were wounded. On the15th July H.M. A/S Trawler Saon was slightly damaged off Dover. One officerwas killed and two ratings wounded. On the 14th July H.M. Destroyer Vanessahad her main engines disabled during an attack on her convoy off Dover, andon the same day H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Esperance Bay was damagedaft by a bomb, 100 miles west of Lands End, but reached Plymouth steering by her engines.On the 18th July H.M. Trawlers Lady Madeline, Spene, Cape Finisterre andStella Leonis were bombed and machine-gunned in the vicinity of Harwich and suffered casualties and damage.On the 14th July the newly built Turkish Sloop Yuzbasi Hakki, with aBritish delivery crew on board, was bombed off Weyrnouth, two men being killed and her Captain wounded.H.M. Submarine Salmon is overdue from patrol off the Norwegian Coast.No signals have been received from her since the 4th July and she is presumed lost.A convoy of five troop ships from India safely arrived at Liverpool on the17th July.Mediterranean.5. During the operations in the Eastern Mediterranean last week the fleet and the slower of the two convoys from Malta to Alexandria which the fleet was covering were continually bombed without success.   Eight heavy air attacks
were made on H.M. Ships Royal Sovereign, Malaya and Eagle between 1100 and2100 on the 11th July, and on the 12th July H.M.S. Warspite was attacked22 times, a total of 260&apos; to 300 bombs being dropped. Fighters from H.M.S. Eagleshot down 4 or 5 bombers with the loss of one machine rendered unserviceable.During the week Alexandria, Gibraltar and Malta have all been attacked by aircraft but no naval damage has been reported.6. H.M. Destroyer Escort whilst screening the heavy ships of the &quot;western mediterranean Force 100 miles to the east of Gibraltar was torpedoed in theearly hours of the 11th July and sank about noon. The crew were rescued, theonly casualty being one officer wounded.A navigating party has been put into the captured Italian submarine GalileoGalilei at Aden, and she is being prepared for passage to Alexandria.Other Foreign Stations.7. On the 12th July the watch on French waters at Martinique andGuadaloupe was withdrawn. .     ..It is reported that on the 13th July the S.S. King John (5,825 tons) was sunk ahout 400 miles north of Barbados by an armed German ship of roughly9,000 tons and the S.S. Davisian (6,433 tons) was sunk about 400 miles north-west of Barbados.There were indications of an enemy ship or submarine in an area 350 miles west of Cape &quot;Verde Islands early on the 16th July; this position is 1,200 milesfrom the nearest of the two sinkings.The S.S. Ganges and the S.S. Clan MacFariane were in collision in the arabian Sea on the 18th July. The Clan MacF ariane has been sunk and theGanges has on board 47 survivors from this ship and is proceeding slowly.French Fleet.8. Officers and men of the French navy who are willing to continue to servemay have the choice of two courses : They may either serve in the Naval Arm ofGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s Force under Admiral Muselier, which will be organised on french lines, including discipline and uniform, or they may enlist in the royal navy for hostilities only. Those who choose the latter course will be liable forgeneral service at the discretion of the Naval authorities and will not be confinednecessarily to the manning of French ships taken over by the Royal Navy.Officers will receive temporary commissions or warrants in the Royal Navy ina rank which will normally be that corresponding to the rank held in the french navy.Home Waters.9. A number of French destroyers, torpedo boats, submarine chasers, escort vessels and other small craft in British ports are to be manned for service byBritish, French, Polish or Dutch crews.The French battleships Courbet and Paris are to be used as guard ships.French warships commissioned for service with the Royal Navy are to flythe French ensign and the White ensign side by side.All French merchant vessels in United Kingdom ports are to be requisi-tioned and placed under the British flag. Crews will be given the alternative of serving the common cause with British rates of pay, &amp;c, or of repatriation toFrance. It is generally intended that local French shipping in distant watersshould continue to trade if it is considered desirable in the Allied interests, but all fast vessels capable of being used as armed merchant cruisers will berequisitioned.Abroad.10. The French Armed Ship Cakaibe is to be released from Mombasa toproceed to In do-China and remain there until the end of the war.A report from a British Master who left Casablanca on the 12th July statesthat work on Jean Bart is continuing and that lorries were seen transportingtorpedoes to warships. In the port, amongst others, were 3 cruisers, 5 destroyers,a number of submarines with their parent ship, 3 heavily armed Fleet Oilers anda very large number of merchant ships.[21542] b
His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided to take no further action in regardto the French ships in French Colonial waters or North African ports unlessproceeding to enemy-controlled ports. The French are to be asked to proposesubmarine exercise areas if they wish to make use of them, and their submarineswill be treated similarly to those of Italy whilst that country was neutral. ships are to be prepared for attack when meeting a French warship, but are not to firethe first shot. French warships under control of the French Government are to betreated as neutral war vessels if approaching a defended port.Anti-Submarine Operations.Home.11. No definitely successful attacks have been reported. The only attack of any promise was made by H.M. Ships Hertford, Havelock, Walker andHarvester in the Western Approaches on the night of the 10th/ 11th July, after which oil was seen to be rising; but there are a number of wrecks in this area, andit is feared that it came from one of them.Mediterranean.12. On the 12th July our aircraft claim to have sunk one submarine offMalta, and a second 120 miles south of Taranto. On the same day theA/S Trawlers Coral and Jade attacked and probably damaged a submarine off Malta.Enemy Attacks on Seaborne Trade.13. During the period three British ships (19,594 tons) and seven ships ofother nationalities (20,535 tons) have been reported sunk by XT-boat; one of these was lost in the Eastern Mediterranean.Aircraft have sunk three British ships (9,440 tons) and four ships of othernationalities (7,950 tons); in addition, fourteen ships have reported damage from air attack, which in some cases was very serious.One merchant ship (1,199 tons) was mined in the Bristol Channel, and acable-laying tug was mined off Newhaven.   The former was not degaussed.Losses from U-boats up to the 15th July occurred S.W. of Ireland, andafter that date N. of Ireland. Losses by air attack chiefly occurred in attacks in the Channel and on East Coast convoys and ports prior to the 15th July, the weather after that date being unsuitable for air attack. R.A.F. Fighter protectionconsiderably reduced the scale of attack. Fighter escorts have been providedfor as many as fourteen convoys on the same day.Details of shipping losses and damage by air attack are given in Appendix I.Protection of Seaborne T rade.14. During the week a total of 868 ships, including 106 Allied and 50neutral, were convoyed, of which 7 ships were lost by enemy action. 1 Cruiser,9 Armed Merchant Cruisers, 25 destroyers and 30 sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duties.Since the start of the war 27,957 ships have been convoyed, of which 22,325were British; this, in terms of tonnage, is about 100 million gross tons, with acarrying capacity of 150 million tons.Further precautions to minimise the risk of air attack include the useof Methil instead of Southend as an assembly port for outward bound convoys,the discontinuance of Southampton as a port for the movements of Army stores and personnel and the avoidance of the English Channel and its western approaches by ocean going ships.15. Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the 13th July totalled 983,320 tons, an increase of 153,145 tons on the figuresof the previous week. Twenty tankers brought 206,326 tons of oil, an increaseof 64,151 tons. Mineral imports amounted to 212,537 tons, of which 123,731 tons were steel, iron ore and scrap. Cereal imports were 138,022 tons. (10 ships were fully loaded with grain and flour.) Other food imports were 108,047 tons compared with 95,799 tons. Of these sugar and molasses came to 60,358 tons,refrigerated meat to 12,585 tons and fruit to 3,778 tons.
Enemy Intelligence.Germany.16. Examination of photographs shows that the warships observed atTrondheim on the 9th July were a Hipper class cruiser and the 6-inch cruiserNurnberg. On the 16th July the situation at Kiel was that Scharnhorst was still in the floating dock, an 8-inch cruiser and cruiser Koln were in theCommercial Harbour, the Lutzoiu was in dry dock with her stern stripped tothe keel. The aircraft carrier previously reported at Kiel had then left. Onthe 15th July at Wilhelmshaven there was no change except that the admiral scheer had moved out of the fitting-out basin.In the earlier part of the period there seem to have been two submarinesat work in the Western Approaches, but by the 14th July there seems to havebeen only one, and all others appeared to be homeward, bound. One of these latter may possibly have spent ten days to a fortnight at Brest before setting out for Germany northabout.It has been established that German E-boats are working from Cherbourgand Brest as well as Willemsoord and Boulogne. They have been reported during the period under review off the Isle of Wight, Dungeness, Start Point,the Nab Tower and Guernsey.Air reconnaissance on the 16th July^showed a considerable number of bargesat Cherbourg, Trouville, Le Havre and Honfleur.A photographic reconnaissance of Lorient and Port Louis showed normalshipping activity.   four naval vessels, possibly destroyers, were at Lorient.A Bomber Command aircraft reported 200-300 barges in the canal between a-rmentieres and Merville at 0551 on the 16th July.Italy.17. Air reconnaissance over the Sicilian ports on the 17th July showed1 battleship, 6 cruisers, probably 8-inch, 9 destroyers and several merchant ships at Messina, 2 cruisers, probably 8-inch; 30 or 40 seaplanes and some merchant ships at Augusta and several merchant ships, including tankers, at Syracuse.Air reconnaissance at Tobruk on the 14th July showed the old cruiserSan Giorgio, 4 destroyers, of which one was aground, 1 submarines and16 merchant ships in the port.Enemy Merchant Shipping.Germany.18. The tanker Rekum (5,540 tons) sailed from Teneriffe on the 17th July.It is considered possible that she may not leave the vicinity of the Canary Islands.Her cargo is estimated as 8,000 tons of gas oil. The Weser (9,179 tons) sailed from Punta Arenas, Costa Rica, on the 16th July for Manzanillo in Mexico, andthe Eisenach (4,177 tons) is reported to be preparing to leave.Italian.19. The German wireless has announced that France is handing back toItaly, in accordance with the terms of the Armistice, those ships which she tookin prize. The only Italian ship known to have been seized by the French is theNicolo Odero (6,003 tons), which was at Marseilles.The Asiatic Petroleum Company has, up to the 17th July, institutedproceedings against 16 Italian merchant ships of a total tonnage of 106,929 tons.Four other ships, totalling 17,041 tons, have been arrested by other companies.Thus 123,970 tons of shipping has been immobilised for debt.An Italian news bulletin has stated that the Paganini (2,427 tons) caughtfire and sank twelve miles off Durazzo with the loss of 226 Italian and Albaniantroops, including 6 officers.   The cause of the disaster was not stated.The Remo (9,780 tons), which was seized at Fremantle when Italy declared war, has now been commissioned as a Royal Australian Fleet Auxiliary for the voyage from Fremantle to Melbourne.   She left Fremantle on the 14th July.Four ships in the Canaries, three of which are grain ships, have dischargedtheir cargoes into store.[21542] B 2
Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.20. More mines have been laid by enemy aircraft during the week10th to 17th July than in the previous week, and, as had been anticipated, theaircraft are proceeding further afield. Liverpool was visited on the 16th July,since when the port has been closed to all shipping except convoys which havebeen swept in and out. The Clyde has also been visited by raiders, some of whichwere observed flying low over the Kyles of Bute. Subsequently a mine exploded,apparently spontaneously, and a parachute has been recovered. Local traffic hasbeen stopped from using this passage until it has been thoroughly searched.The Tyne was closed for about twelve hours on the 13th July, and Harwich for about thirteen hours on the 14th July.Enemy aircraft were reported in the vicinity of Loch Torridon on the8th July, and during the night of the 11th July there were two heavy explosionsin the Loch.  It is possible that the aircraft intended to lay mines in Loch Ewe.21. Mine Destructor Ships, after an interval of five weeks, have again been successful. The Burlington has exploded six mines in Loch Ewe this week.Twelve mines have now been accounted for in this Loch and they may well havebeen all one lay by a submarine. The Cor field has exploded three mines in theBarrow Deep, thus bringing the total of magnetic mines exploded by M.D. ships to thirty-three.The number of mines exploded by LL Sweeps this week is twenty-six, beingthe highest weekly total so far. Ten were exploded off the Tyne, 1 off Blyth, 2 east of Orfbrdness, 2 off Harwich, 5 in or near the Downs Edinburgh Channel, 4 inthe Downs and 2 in the Crosby Channel, Liverpool. The magnetic mine total isnow 359, of which LL Sweeps have exploded 199.No contact mines have been exploded during the week.Amble, which has been closed since the 4th July, was reopened on the12th July with an approach channel marked by Dan buoys. Mines are suspectedthere in 3 fathoms, which makes the LL Sweep undesirable, and the MagnetSweep is being used instead.Newhaven has been closed since the 3rd July. One mine is suspected just offthe port in 2\ fathoms, and this is being searched for by the Mine RecoveryFlotilla. Two Drifters fitted with the Baby L Sweeps have been sent to Newhavento help.British Minelaying.22. On the 11th July H.M.S. Teviot Bank laid 272 mines in the East coast barrier. H.M.S. Express and H.M.S. Impulsive laid fifty-two-mines of a specialcharacter partly for test purposes in the East Coast Barrier on the 17th July.On the 14th July H.M.S. Plover and the Dutch ship Willem Van Den Zaan laideighty contact mines and ninety moored magnetic mines in the Dover area. Thisis the first occasion on which the latter type of mine has been laid. Minelayingby aircraft has continued.Economic Warfare.23. During the week ending the 15th July 7,445 tons of cargo were seizedin prize in Danish and Greek ships. The main items were 32,276 tons of basemetals and 5,086 tons of textiles.Between the 1st July and the 16th July, 8,250 tons of natural phosphates,700 tons of iron and steel, and 2-54 tons of sewing cotton have been seized in italian ships.A Greek ship with a cargo of oil from the Persian Gulf was prohibited fi&apos;omentering the Mediterranean and was diverted.MILITARY SITUATION.Italy.24. No recent information of military activity in Italy or Albania has beenreceived. Leave has been granted to military personnel for harvesting. this may be the first step towards a reduction of forces under arms due to the lesseningof military commitments on the Franco-Italian frontier.Recent reports of the presence of German formations in Italy have not been confirmed.
Libya.25. British activity has been confined to offensive action by units of the armoured Division which have prevented the Italians from restoring an adequateline of communication to Fort Capuzzo. On the 13th July British units engageda supply column and inflicted casualties while, on the 17th July, the enemy lost5 Field guns, 3 Anti-tank guns and 12 lorries.26. The Italians now appear to be moving part of their North AfricanGarrison from the West to the East. This, and the presence of Marshal Grazianiin Libya, suggest that they contemplate greater offensive activity against Egypt.Bast Africa and Somaliland.27. In East Africa on the 10th July British Moyale was attacked by strong-forces of the enemy supported by artillery and mortars. The garrison, one company- of the King&apos;s African Rifles, put up a stout resistance. British reinforcements established themselves on the escarpment 2,000 yards from thepost but were unable, to gain contact with the garrison. On the 14th July when their water supply was almost exhausted, the garrison of the post withdrew.28. In Somaliland patrols of our Somaliland Camel Corps have been active.On the 13th July a patrol attacked an enemy post at Au Boba and withdrewafter inflicting casualties. In an even more successful raid on the 15th Julyanother patrol occupied Demera Bob and destroyed both the post and 20,000rounds of ammunition.The 2nd Battalion King&apos;s African Rifles and 1st Royal African LightBattery have arrived at Berbera from Mombasa.Turkey and the Balkan States.29. In Bulgaria the two divisions opposite the Dobrudja are now at war strength and have been reinforced by a cavalry brigade also at war strength.30. In Turkey no further details have been received of the concentration of the Turkish Army, but it may be assumed that both mobilisation andconcentration have now been completed.AIR SITUATION.General Review.31. Weather conditions have again generally restricted air operations during the week. Our bombing attacks continue to be directed against theGerman Air Force and shipping concentrations, while those of the enemy, whichhave considerably decreased in intensity, were again chiefly on ports and shipping.Apart from Italian attacks on British naval units, the character of air operations in the Mediterranean and Middle East remained unchanged.Great Britain.32. The intensity of enemy air attacks was reduced from the beginning ofthe week and, towards the end, was probably further curtailed by adverse weather.They were chiefly concentrated by day on shipping in the Channel and off theEast Coast, and on certain ports in South Wales and in the south of England.The heaviest attacks were made on Portland and Portsmouth on the 11th July,and on the Channel Convoy on the 14th, about fifty enemy aircraft being engaged on each occasion. The damage done to the two ports was slight, but one ship in the Channel Convoy was sunk and two were damaged. The most seriousraid on land objectives was on the 12th, when the Aberdeen Iron Works were damaged and considerable casualties inflicted. During the week 88 people were killed and about 300 injured. By night the enemy was mainly engaged inminelaying, usually on the East Coast, between the Forth and North Foreland,though on two nights aircraft reached Liverpool Bay. A diary of enemy bombing attacks is given in Appendix V.33. Fighter Command flew 984 patrols, involving 3,288 sorties, over this country, and destroyed 37 enemy aircraft confirmed and 25 unconfirmed.Our fighter losses totalled 17.
Germany and German-Occupied Territory.34. While our attacks were again chiefly aimed at the reduction of thescale of air attack on this country and at preparations for invasion, operations against oil and industrial targets and communications were continued. In thefirst category, aerodromes were largely given as secondary objectives and wereextensively attacked owing to -unfavourable weather conditions, whichconsiderably restricted our operations. Nevertheless, our bombers have successfully attacked many important targets, including airframe factories,aluminium works, shipbuilding yards, naval establishments, oil plants, railwaysand canals. A summary of our attacks is contained in Appendix VI, which also contains information from recent Raid Assessment Reports.35. Bomber Command flew 104 day and 299 night sorties. We lost tenaircraft, but no less than twenty enemy figrkfers were destroyed.North Sea and Coastal.36. Anti-invasion, anti-submarine and routine patrols were curtailed inthe North owing to weather conditions, but were flown as usual over the central and Southern portions of the North Sea and over the English Channel. Thewhole Irish coast-line was also reconnoitred. In spite of the weather,photographic reconnaissances were made of numerous por,ts from Trondheim toLa Rochelle. A barge-borne balloon barrage was revealed at Kiel, and the seaplane-base and aerodromes appear to be extensively occupied. On the12th July an Anson on escort patrol near the East Coast shot down a He. Ill,and on the 17th some Blenheims on patrol between Havre and Cherbourg shot down a Ju. 87. On the 15th July a Sunderland successfully engaged 5 enemy aircraft which were attacking the City of Limerick south of Bishop Rock :one was damaged and the rest made off. Coastal Command also participatedin the bombing operations already described. minelaying was carried out on every night of the week, Bomber Command making 48 sorties.37. Coastal Command flew 147 routine and 153 special patrols, involving445 sorties, and 86 convoys were escorted. This Command lost eight aircraft during the week.Middle East and Mediterranean.General.38. Air operations in the Middle East and Mediterranean maintained their normal character except for the air attacks on the British Fleet. Reconnaissanceswere maintained in all areas. Operations from Italian East Africa continueto be light and ineffective, and the unserviceability of landing grounds is nowadded to the difficulties of maintenance and fuel, to which we have previouslyreferred.Air A attacks on British Fleet.39. The air attacks on British naval units, already described in the NavalSection, were carried out with surprising determination. Although only one hitwas obtained, it is reported that formations approached their targets steadily,only single aircraft turning away when fired at. Most attacks were made a.ta height of 12,000 feet. Aircraft used were apparently S. 79&apos;s and are evidentlypart of the bomber force of No. 2 Squadra Aerea concentrated in Sicily : the&quot; crack &quot; No. 12 Stormo took a leading part in the operations. In addition,Italian sources state that thirty bombers operated from Libya. As already described, losses were comparatively heavy.. Aircraft are thought to have carrieda bomb load of 2,250 lbs., which is half their maximum load and would givea range of over 1,400 miles.Gibraltar.40.   Our aircraft dropped leaflets over Casablanca, Rabat and Port Lyautey.
Malta.41. Sporadic attacks have continued without success. On the 11th July,twelve enemy aircraft were intercepted by our Hurricanes and driven off withoutbombing: one Hurricane was damaged. Another unsuccessful attempt wasmade on the 13th, when the enemy aircraft were intercepted by one Hurricaneand one Gladiator, the Hurricane being damaged. On the night of13th/14th July, four enemy aircraft succeeded in dropping bombs on the Island,but no damage was done and there were no casualties. A patrol of six enemy fighters flew over the Island on the 16th July and were engaged by a Hurricaneand a Gladiator. In the course of the fight the Hurricane and one of the enemy fighters were shot clown. On the 11th July, a Sunderland Flying Boat based on Malta sank an Italian submarine.Palestine.42. On the 15th July, five enemy aircraft attacked the Iraq petroleum company&apos;s oil tanks at Haifa. Three tanks were set on fire but only one wasfull at the time.Egypt.43. Several successful bombing attacks were made during the week. On the10th July twenty-two Blenheims attacked the Italian oil dump seven miles southof Tobruk. The target was hit, but the damage w^as unobserved owing to cloud.Bardia was bombed on the night of the 12th-13th July and three large fires were started, and again on the 14th, when direct hits were made on the clumps. Tobrukwas attacked on four occasions during the week. On the night of the12th-13th July an attack was made on ships in the harbour, but results were notobserved owing to low visibility. On the night of the 13th-14th July 16 bombs were dropped within the target area and two large explosions were caused. Onthe night of the 15th-16th, and again on the 17th, bombs were dropped on oil tanks and large columns of smoke were observed. A successful attack was madeon El Gazala aerodrome on the 15th July. On the same day an enemy militaryencampment at El Fiada was bombed, but results could not be observed.44. There was little enemy activity. Alexandria was attacked by single aircraft on the 15th and 16th July, but the bombs fell mostly in the sea, exceptfor one on the King&apos;s Palace. Mersa Matruh was bombed on two occasions andSidi Barrani once, but no damage was done.Sudan.45. On the 12th July nine Wellesleys carried out a dive-bombing attack onMassawa aerodrome and bursts were seen among the hangars. One of our aircraft was shot clown. On the 14th July five Wellesleys attacked the listening-post at Gura, south-west of Massawa, and on the 16th Wellesleys bombed the aerodromes at Agordat and Asmara, destroying a hangar at the former and buildings at the latter.Kenya.46. On the 11th July tw^o aircraft of the South African Air Force bombedKismayu, but results could not be observed. On the 11th and 14th Italian forcesat Moyale were successfully attacked with bombs and machine guns. On the 15thsix Blenheims attacked Diredawa and registered hits on the barracks, while threeBlenheims attacked a bomb dump south of Assab.47. Wajir, 300 miles north-east of Nairobi, was attacked by the enemy onthe 11th July. Two aircraft of the South African Air Force intercepted thethree enemy bombers engaged and destroyed one of them, another being shot downby a detachment of King&apos;s African Rifles. On the same day Buna, south-east ofMoyale, was also bombed without result. On the 13th July Bunburya was attacked and one of our aircraft was seriously damaged on the ground.A den and Somaliland.48. On the 9th and 10th July attacks were made on Macaaca aerodrome. Onthe first occasion direct hits were registered on a hangar, and on the second, three enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground.   Assab was raided three times,
and on the 13th July a petrol dump was hit and fires started. On the 15th july bomb dump south of Assab was attacked, and on the same day Diredawa wasraided with success. Enemy activity was limited to an attack on Berbera on tho10th July, in which 12 civilian casualties were caused, and another on Aden onthe 13th July, which did slight damage to property.German Air Operations.49. The main effort of the small-scale operations against this country wascentred on shipping in the North Sea, English Channel and South-western approaches. The extreme limits were the northern part of the Bay of Biscayto as far west as 250 miles from Ushant, and on the 12th July an aircraft ofunknown type sank a trawler about 50 miles off the east coast of Iceland.50. The use of fighters as escorts in varying strength for the protection of bomber formations and single reconnaissance aircraft has become moreprevalent. Short-range dive-bombers were used increasingly over the english channel, and attacks on shipping were carried out by mixed forces of short and long range bombers and fighters, which generally suffered severe casualties.51. Bomber-reconnaissance units were very active throughout the week,especially in search of shipping, and most units provided aircraft for this purposeeach day. Extensive flights were also made over Southern England, apparentlyfor the purpose of reconnoitring aerodromes. Daily weather flights were made over the usual areas, which include the whole of the North Sea and english channel, and which on three days took in Southern Eire. Minelaying aircraft were again identified on most nights, and penetrated as far as Liverpool.52. The main centre of transport activity has moved from the Brussels area to the region of Paris, and in particular Le Bourget. This is accounted for bythe fact that overland communications to Belgium have become more normal, andthose to and beyond Paris are still unable to carry the necessary weight of suppliesfur the units located-in France.German Air Intelligence.Losses.53. The total confirmed losses from the 3rd September, 1939, to the16th July, 1940, inclusive, amount to 2,854. The losses from the 1st July, 1940,to the 16th July, 1940, inclusive, amount to 125 confirmed and 82 unconfirmed.Tactical Policy.54. A note on the present development of German tactical policy is containedin Appendix VII.Italian Air Operations.55.   Italian air operations have already been summarised in paragraph 38.Italian Air Intelligence.Fighter Tactics.56. Italians are using fighter aircraft to precede their bombers with theobject of drawing off our defensive patrols. These tactics are being used bothin the attacks on Malta and in Kenya. Over Malta they operate in largeformations stepped up by flights, by which means they hope to gain the advantage over our limited number of fighters.Parachute Troops.57. Photographs have appeared in the Italian press showing Italianparachutists under training. No details are given, but they are probably being-trained at Viterbo.&apos; Dive-Bombing.58. A number of Italian crews are undergoing dive-bombing instruction onJu. 87 aircraft at Graz, in South Austria.    Germany is known to have
considerable reserves of. this type and it is possible that some may be taken overby Italy. Land forces in the Western Desert report being dive-bombed by ahigh-wing monoplane which is thought to be a Henschel 126. No Italian aircraftcorresponding to this description is built, and it consequently appears that this may be one of a consignment of Henschel 126 sent to Italy by Germany.Movements of Fighter Squadrons59. From various sources it is reported that fighter squadrons are being transferred from North to South Italy. Apparently Italy now thinks that sheis perfectly safe from attack in the North.Guidonia.60. There is considerable concentration and activity at the research establishment at Guidonia. New types are being tested and R/T sets for fightersare being manufactured. On the 9th July Signor Mussolini visited Guidonia to inspect eight new types of aircraft.Aerodrome Defence in Libya.61. Unserviceable aircraft are now being used to create dust storms toscreen aircraft on the ground from air attack. The unserviceable aircraft arepicketed at the corners of the aerodrome and the engines started when attackis threatened. Dummy aircraft are being left at evacuated aerodromes whenunits are moved to other operational bases.Italian East A frica.62. Air Service. An almost daily service is now operated, Rome-Benghasi-Asmara (Eritrea).63. Movements. It is expected that Neghelli and Javello, both on the Kenyaborder, will shortly be reinforced by three bombers each from Addis Ababa.There are indications that Italian East Africa is to be reinforced by six S. 79&apos;s,which are to fly from Benghasi via Cufra64. Landing Grounds. Further rain is making the surfaces of landing grounds soggy, and it is now known that aircraft can only operate from some ofthem with considerably reduced load.65. Fighter Position. Taking into consideration the confirmed fighterlosses in Italian East Africa, the present strength is assessed at 31 only, and itis considered that this is an outside estimate in view of the number thought to bedamaged.66. Loss of Detonators. The successful attack by our Gladiators on thabomb store near Assab on the 7th July resulted in the destruction of 19,000 bombjdetonators. This should substantially affect the bomb potential in Italian East]Africa.Losses and Casualties..67. Italian losses in aircraft for the week ending the 16th are 17 confirmed,5 unconfirmed and 10 damaged, bringing the total to 157 (100 confirmed,26 unconfirmed and 31 damaged). Casualties to personnel in June were 71 killed in action, 75 missing and 103 injured. Seventy pilots were killed or missing andare stated to be among the best regular pilots in the Service.U.S.A,68. Army Aviation Expansion. The Assistant Secretary for Warannounced on the 14th June that the Army&apos;s intention was to train 2,400 youngmen as pilots during the next two years. The army&apos;s ultimate aim is to&apos; train7,000 a year : 2,200 training aircraft are to be ordered shortly. A note on NavalAviation Expansion was given last week.[21542] c
69. Marine Corps Aircraft Carriers. It is intended that Marine Corpspilots shall in future be trained in operations from aircraft carriers. Thefollowing statement made before the House Naval Committee is of considerable interest: &quot;It is going to be essential that the Navy have at least three carriersover and above actual number needed for air support of the fleets themselvesto be assigned for Marine Corps operations in connection with the missionsof the Marines in support of fleet operations. The main mission of theMarines is to support the fleet in securing advance naval bases, and then in holding such bases after the fleet moves on its main operations. To holdsuch bases an increasingly important element is aviation. The aviators andairplanes that must be left in support of such advance naval bases must be over and. above the need of pilots and planes operating in support of thefleet itself. Therefore, there must be separate aircraft carriers to supplyMarine air support in taking advance bases, and to keep transportingMarine squadrons as replacements in the task of holding such bases.&quot;70. 75-mm. Cannon. It is reliably reported that a 75-mm. gun has beenfired experimentally from a bomber aircraft in the air. No details are yet available, but it is probable that the aircraft used was a Boeing 15 four-enginedbomber.Bulgaria.71. Aircraft. Reports of the recent arrival of 40 Messerschmidt 109Fighters from Germany is confirmed from a variety of sources. One report, notconfirmed, states that this delivery of Messerschmidts forms a part of a consign-ment of 250-300 German aircraft being sent, which are not being sold to Bulgariabut are to be retained in the country by Germany for future eventualities. It isreported that as spare propellers for German aircraft in Bulgaria cannot nowbe obtained from Germany, efforts are being made to manufacture them locally.72. Germans in Bulgaria. It is reported that on. the 9th June a secondparty, of 46 Germans, mostly young men, arrived at Rustchuk by river and leftthat evening for Kazanlyk and Karlovo aerodromes, to which the first party had also proceeded.73. Air Personnel in Italy. The Bulgarian Air Force officers who recentlyvisited Bari in Italy, as well as others undergoing training in that country,returned to Bulgaria on the 25th May.74. Bombs. Bombs of Italian pattern have been manufactured at Kazanlykand are reported to have proved satisfactory.Roumania.75. German and Italian Aircraft. The rumours prevalent in Bucharestrecently that large numbers of German and Italian aircraft had arrived in roumania have, it is reported, been officially denied by the Roumanian GeneralStaff. Thirty Dornier 215 have been on order from Germany for some time butthe contract had not been signed. The German Delegation in Roumania whowere to sign the contract, as well as one for some V.D.M. propellers, receivedorders from Berlin not to sign. At the same time information was received thatthe delivery of the Me. 109 Fighters, which was scheduled to commence in August,was suspended.76. German Air Force Personnel. All German technical personnel withthe Roumanian Air Force were ordered to return to Germany last month.77. Air Force Efficiency. A circular order was issued by the Ministry ofAir and Marine on the 4th June to all air units, drawing attention to the lackof efficiency and keenness noticed by. the A.0.C.-in-C. during his . recentinspections. Among many defects, mention is made of an exercise given to a fighter Group in which they were required to take off to repel an imaginaryattack by bombers. It took them 23 minutes to do this and even then some; ofthe aircraft took off without ammunition. The order also mentioned that someof the A.A. defences could not function for lack of certain essential parts.
78. Civil A viaiionj Colonel Scariat Raclulescu has been dismissed from thepost of Director of Civil Aviation and replaced by Colonel Constantin Mincu,who is said to be more favourably disposed towards the Allies than his predecessor.It was announced in the Bucharest press on the 24th June that from thatdate, for a period of one month, the Bucharest Ankara Air Service would be suspended. The reason given -was that the Istanbul aerodrome was being closedf for repairs.Spain.79. German Aircraft. Twenty-seven Messerschmidt 109 air-frames haverecently been delivered at Seville. It is believed that these have been in store in spain since the Civil War and are now to.be reassembled.80. Fernando Po. The extension of the Santa Isabel landing ground onthe island of Fernando Po is being carried out and proceeding rapidly. A secondaerodrome, Lorenzo Ricti, was declared open on the 4th May, 1940.81. Rio de Oro. It is possible that the Italians are now intending to useVilla Cisneros, in Spanish Rio de Oro, as a base for their Ala Littoria trans-Atlantic air services.82. Canaries. Work on Los Rodeos landing ground on the island ofTeneriffe has been in progress for several months, and latterly has been speededup considerably.Russia.83. Baltic States-A. reliable source estimates that the Russian Air Force inthe Baltic States consists of 1,200 aircraft, 600 in Lithuania, 400 in Latvia and700 in Estonia.84. Parachute Troops. The Russians are said to have landed some800 parachute troops behind the Roumanians during the occupation of Bessarabiaand Northern Bukovina, possibly to prevent the withdrawal of cattle and railwayrolling-stock from the ceded territory.Japan.85. Fuel Purchases. -The Japanese have made purchases of aviation spiritfrom both United States and the Netherlands East Indies for delivery up toand including September next, in quantities in excess of those required for anyscale of operations likely to be undertaken in China. These purchases suggestthat any intended operations will not involve the Netherlands East Indies or belikely to provoke a United States embargo.86. Activities in lndo-China.r It is reported that Japanese twin-enginedbombers have been seen on aerodromes in Indo-China, and that Hanoi appearsto be almost entirely under Japanese control, but this should be treated withreserve : the aircraft seen may have been those used to transport some of theJapanese mission now in Indo-China, and not necessarily a concentration of operational units of the Japanese Air Force. It is also reported that, during aninspection-flight along the Indo-China border, a Japanese General and french officials were shot down in error by a Japanese fighter from a squadron basedat Haiphong, Indo-China.[21542]

DURING the period under review the following casualties have beenreported  Officers :  11 killed, 7 wounded.Ratings : 44 killed, 28 wounded.In addition, the crew of H.M. Submarine Shark, 5 officers and 36 ratingsare missing, possibly prisoners of war.APPENDIX Y.Summary of Air Attacks on Great Britain.Daylight Attacks.11 th July. About noon, considerable activity started with an attack by aboutfifty aircraft on Portland and off the coast. Two ships in the harbour were slightly damaged. Eight Me. 110, one He. Ill and one Ju. 88 were shot down.Attacks on convoys off the coast of Suffolk were made in the afternoon, but theywere unsuccessful. Later in the day there was an attack on Portsmouth by a formation of long-range bombers escorted by twin-engined fighters. There was little naval damage, but two barges half-loaded with ammunition were sunk, and nine civilians were killed. Seven He. Ill and two Me. 110 were shot down inthe ensuing engagement.12th July. The chief features of the day&apos;s operations were attacks on shipping off tne Norfolk Coast and off the Isle of Wight, and a raid off Aberdeenwhere a shipyard was bombed and considerably damaged. Several people were killed and wounded. In the course of the day the enemy lost seven He. Ill, twoDo. 17 and one Ju. 88.13th July. The enemy again concentrated his effort against convoys and shipping off the East and South Coasts. No damage was clone and there were no casualties. There were several engagements, in the course of which the enemylost six bombers and six fighters.14th July. With the exception of three small raids over Poole, which didnot penetrate inland, enemy activities were again directed against our convoys and shipping. The only big engagement of the day was in the Dover-Calaisarea about 1500 hours, where the enemy attacked the Channel Convoy, sinking-one merchant vessel and damaging two others. Our fighters intercepted and shot down six of the enemy aircraft.15th July.- Bad weather restricted the activities of the enemy. In the afternoon a formation of enemy aircraft attacked a convoy off the Suffolk coast and set two merchant vessels on fire. They were, however, intercepted by our fighters and one was shot down. The enemy&apos;s main activity wTas, however, directed against South Wales and South-West England, where bombs were dropped butonly slight damage was caused.l%th July. Enemy activity Avas on a reduced scale. Our fighters shot downone enemy bomber off the coast of Scotland and two off the Isle of Wight. Afew bombs were dropped in the North-East of Scotland, but no serious &quot;damage was done.11th Jxily. Bad weather again reduced the enemy&apos;s scale of attack on thiscountry. An attack was made on shipping off Dundee and on trawlers off beachy head. Bombs were dropped in Ayrshire and in the South of England, but the damage was slight.18th July (till 12 noon). In the morning there was slight enemy activity.Bombs were dropped on Montrose aerodrome, where some damage was done, andthere were a few civilian casualties.
Night Attacks.11th 112th July. A series of ineffective raids were carried out, mostly bysingle aircraft.  No serious damage was done anywhere.12th/13th July. -There was a number of sporadic attacks with incendiary bombs in the South of Scotland, in Northumberland and Yorkshire, and in SouthWales, but no serious damage was done.13th/14th July. There was little enemy activity during the night, but mine-laying is suspected in the Thames Estuary, and. between Middlesbrough and theWash. Fighters were despatched, but there were no interceptions. There is noreport of bombs having been dropped.14th / 15th July. There was some bombing during the night. AtAvonmouth the main line station was damaged, and at Dover the Duke of York&apos;sSchool was set on fire, but the fire was soon extinguished. There was also someminelaying in the Thames Estuary and. off Harwich.15th/16th July. Operations were restricted by bad weather. The enemyappears to have mainly concentrated his effort on minelaying off the Mersey andthe North-East Coast. Bombs were, however, dropped at Silloth in Cumberland,where there were a few slight casualties, but no material damage.16th/11th July. The night was fairly quiet, but bombs were dropped in theEast of Scotland.   There were no casualties and the damage was slight.17th/ 18th July. There was little enemy activity during the night, butminelaying is suspected in the Bristol Channel and off Plymouth. Bombs were dropped at Gillingham, near Felixstowe and at Neath in South Wales. Therewere a few casualties, but the damage to property is believed to be slight.APPENDIX  VI.Summary of Attacks on Germany and German-Occupied Territory.Daylight Attacks.11th July. Bad weather forced our bombers to abandon their primary tasks of bombing aluminium works, barges on waterways in the Low Countries, and oil targets, but Boulogne and Schipol Aerodromes and Boulogne harbour were bombed successfully.12th July. Very bad weather hindered day operations, but attacks weremade on the Island of Leidam and on barges in the Bruges-Ostend Canal.13th July. Most of the twenty-two Blenheims, which operated during theday, were forced to abandon their tasks owing to lack of cloud cover, but success-ful attacks were made on the oil plant at Monheim, the aerodrome at Brussels and canal barges at Bruges. A Hudson aircraft made direct hits on the quay and warehouses at Harlingen, in Holland., and started fires.14th July. Lack of cloud cover hampered operations, but oil installationsat Ghent were attacked.15th July. Unfavourable weather conditions prevented the majority of aircraft from performing their tasks. However, bombs were dropped close to aircraft on the ground at Lisieux and Evreux, where results were unobserved.lQth Jidy. Operations were again restricted by weather, but our Blenheimsbombed St. Inglevert aerodrome and barges near Armentieres, one of which was directly hit.17th July. Thirteen Blenheims operated during the day, but elevenabandoned their task owing to adverse weather conditions. Two aircraft bombedbarges at Enkhuisen in the Zuider Zee and on the Bruges Canal, and hits were observed. Attacks were also made on Cherbourg and on oil installations at Ghent.18th July (till 12-00 noon).-Nine Blenheims successfully attacked aero-dromes in North-West France and barges in the canal north-west of Pernes.[21542] d
Night Attacks.llth/12th July. In spite of extremely bad weather, our bombers successfully attacked oil plants at Monheim, the shipbuilding yards at Bremen, aluminiumworks at Mundelheim, and blast furnaces at Dusseldorf. Direct hits were madeon Waalhaven and Schipol aerodromes12th 113th July. Twenty-two Whitleys successfully- attacked navai1armaments targets at Emden and Kiel. Large fires were started at Emden, butthe results at Kiel were difficult to observe.l&apos;Sth/14:th July. Ninety-nine heavy bombers were despatched to attackvarious targets, including an airframe factory and docks at Bremen, railway communications at Hamm, Osnabruck and Soest, wharves at Duisburg-Ruhrort,an oil refinery at Monheim, an aircraft factory at Deichshausen, aluminium works at Grevenbroich, the aerodrome at Borkum, and petroleum works at Emden.Bombs were dropped, but results were difficult to observe, One Hampden attackedthree Me. 110 which were about to land at Borkum and one was seen to fall intothe sea in flames.14th115th July. Seventy-eight bombers were employed.. Fires were started at an oil factory at Gelsenkirchen, in the marshalling yards at Hamm and Soest,at or near the aircraft factory at Bremen, and at the Buer aerodrome. direct hits were claimed on the aircraft parks at Diepholz and Paderborn, and on oil tanks at Ghent.15th/16th July. The operations of our bombers were again much restrictedbecause of the weather, but twenty Hampdens successfully attacked the aircraftpark at Paderborn and an oil refinery at Hanover. They also attacked a blast furnace at Hamborn, where explosions and fires were caused, and,the aerodromes at De Kooy and nor deney, where fires were started.16th111th July. All night&apos;operations were cancelled owing to unfavourable weather conditions.11th118th July. Most of the operations were cancelled owing to the weather conditions, but successful attacks were made on Mcrville aerodrome, wherefires were started, and on the synthetic oil plant at Gelsenkirchen, where a largeexplosion was observed.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week : -Hamburg.The administrative buildings of Blohm &amp; Voss and a tobacco warehousedestroyed. The largest dry dock rendered unusable and a bridge across the Elbeseverely damaged. Steamers unload into barges owing to serious damage to thequays, and considerable areas are roped off and the public not allowed to enter.Muenster.The timber works of Messrs. Ostermann &amp; Schweiwe completely destroyedby fire.Kiel.The damage to the Scharnhorst is such that the vessel will be out, of commission for some time to come.Bremen.Further reports have been received of the damage caused to Krupp&apos;ssubsidiary, the Norddeutsche Hutte A.G.Leverkeusen. \Bayers Chemical factory seriously damaged.Rechlinghausen.The Buna Werke at Huls hit and damaged.
Grevenbroich.Vereinigte Aluminiumwerke hit and damaged.A machine shop and part of the factory plant of the Badische Anilinwerkewere blown up by a delayed-action bomb four hours after a raid.APPENDIX YII.German Air Force Tactical Policy,The German Air Force continues to maintain its present aim of consolidationand the re-equipment of certain units but, in the meantime, as has been statedpreviously, it has been found necessary to carry out operations, even if only ona minor scale, so as to maintain both service and civilian morale. There is anotherprobable reason for these small-scale operations, which are carried out in varyingforms. The German Air Force has come up against a thoroughly organisedfighter defence system for the first time and therefore it has little practical experience with which to tackle this new problem. Also the German high command have probably had doubts about certain salient points of their pastpolicy, such as dependence on guns as opposed to fighters for defence at night and trusting in evasion or fighter escorts for the defence of bomber aircraftrather than in defensive armament. Thus it seems that the operations against this country may perhaps be defined as tactical experiments on which future policy can be based. ............Preliminary night raids were made over this country and it was found thata certain degree of interception could be effected by British fighters at night.Within a few days arrangements were made for certain German fighter units to undergo night-flying training and it is known that one formation now fliesby night with fair regularity and that areas are allotted for training.Raids in daylight have been made by long-range bombers operating singlyand in formation. These aircraft, which were originally designed for evasion,are now fitted with extra guns and, in addition, are usually armoured. Raids(have also been made by mixed formations of long-range and dive bombers andby such formations with fighter escort. Short-range dive bombers have operated in formation alone and also with an escort of double their own strength of fighters. Reconnaissance aircraft have operated singly at great heights and havealso been escorted by as much as a staffel of single-seater fighters.It is anticipated that the special experimental gruppe of twin-enginedfighters equipped as bombers which has recently been formed will at any time be tried out against this country.This variegated pattern of tactics shows that there is at present no settled policy, but that these experiments are designed to devise the best tactics to beemployed by both bombers and fighters.
