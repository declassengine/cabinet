This Report has formed thebasis of our strategy in the present situation.2.      The Report was based upon a number of very importantassumptions.      In our view the most important was that setout in paragraph 1 and which read as follows:-&quot;^WVe assume that the United States of Ame r i c ais willing to give us full economic andfinancial support, without which we do notthink we could continue the war with any chance of success&quot;.3.     We recommended, on the advice of the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare,  that we should aim at controlling atsource the essential., commodities required by the enemy.The essence of this problem was that we should receive thefull economic and financial collaboration of the UnitedStates of America and of the Southern American States.4*      In spite of the careful consideration which has beengiven to this question of the control of raw materialsat source, we doubt whether the vital necessity of obtaining the co-operation of the United States of America and all theSouth American States, has been sufficiently appreciated.We would point out that without this co-operation the fact remains that &quot;we do not think we could continue the warwith any chance of success&quot;.W.P.(40) 168.

5.      We understand that negotiations with a view to securing American economic collaboration are proceeding.There are signs that the Americans intend to co-operate and that President Roosevelt will perhaps give a lead tothe South American States at a conference he proposes tohold on the 14th July.      We understand also that aproposal has been put forward that an economic mission should go to America with a view to impressing the americans with the vital importance of the question.6.      We feel that it is most important that, toenable us to win the war, every possible step should betaken to ensure the full financial and economic co-operation of the whole of the American continent.(S i signed)    R.H.
