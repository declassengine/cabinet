naval SITUATION.General Review.THE Armistice between France on the one hand and Germany and Italyon the other came into force at 0035 on the 25th June. In consequence, naval action has been concerned mainly with the evacuation of British refugees and allied (Polish and Czech) troops from France and with taking such action as hasbeen possible to prevent French warships falling into enemy hands.Shipping losses from submarine attack have increased.Enemy heavy ships have been operating from Trondheim.Northern Waters.2. At 2235 on the 20th June H.M. Submarine Clyde, 60 miles north ofTrondheim Fjord, sighted a force of enemy ships, apparently consisting of onebattle-cruiser, one pocket battleship and one destroyer, steering N.N.W. the battle-cruiser was attacked and hit with one torpedo. The attack was reportedwhen the Clyde surfaced at 0100 on the 21st June.3. At 0830 on the 21st June H.M. Ships Manchester, Sheffield,Birmingham and York left Rosyth to rendezvous with the Newcastle and Sussexeastward of Scapa and proceed towards the Norwegian coast. ELM. ShipsRenown and Repulse with five destroyers sailed from Scapa at 1215 for thesame rendezvous. At 1115 aircraft reported one battle-cruiser and six destroyersoff Sogne Fjord steering south at 25 knots. The aircraft shadowed and sixSwordfish of the Fleet Air Arm were sent to attack. They attacked the battle-cruiser with torpedoes, but were unsuccessful and two of them were shot down.A later attack by six Hudsons and nine Beauforts with 500-lb. bombs obtained at least one hit near the stern and two near the foreward turrets. During this attack four of our aircraft were shot down. Our shadowing aircraft wereafterwards driven off by enemy fighters, and, as visibility enabled our cruisers tobe constantly shadowed and attacked by enemy aircraft, they were unable to make contact with the enemy warships. At 0123 on the 22nd June our forces were withdrawn.4.&quot; On the 23rd June two heavy cruisers (one of which may have been abattle-cruiser) and three destroyers were sighted by aircraft in Trondheim Fjordand photographed.5. The French Submarine Rubis completed a minelaying operation off theNorwegian coast on the 24th June.6. On the 25th June H.M. Submarine Snapper attacked a small southboundconvoy escorted by aircraft off Stavanger. One ship is believed to have been sunk.7. During the night the 26th-27th June H.M. Aircraft Carrier Argus, withWalrus amphibian aircraft, and S.S. Andes, with 3,000 personnel, arrived atReykj avik (Iceland).Home Waters.French Coast.8. Between the 20th and 25th June the evacuation of British subjects andof Polish and Czech troops was continued from St. Nazaire, La Pallice, Le Verdon,Bordeaux, Bayonne, Arcachon and St. Jean de Luz. H.M. Ships Galatea,Arethusa, Calcutta and a number of destroyers in addition to merchant vessels were engaged in this operation.9. The President of Poland embarked in H.M.S. Arethusa on the 21st, andthe British Ambassador and Ministers for the Dominions, and their staffs, inFI.M.S. Galatea on the 23rd. On the 24th ships taking part in the evacua-tion from Bayonne and St. Jean de Luz were bombed, but evacuation was completed by the afternoon of the 25th.   Up to noon on the 22nd the following
personnel - and stores had been evacuated since the commencement of this operation : 136,549 British troops, of whom 2.488 were casualties.12,716 Allied troops.310 guns, 2,292 vehicles, 919 tons of ammunition and 981 tons of stores.Demolitions were carried out by H.M.S. Beagle at Bordeaux and La Pallice.10. On the 26th June, while searching for a French merchant vessel off theGironde, H.M. Canadian Destroyer Fraser came into collision with H.M.S.Calcutta and was cut in half. Casualties were only slight. On the same day allneutral merchant vessels in the Gironde area were successfully rounded up byH.M. Destroyers Broke, Vanquisher and Witherington.Channel Islands.11 Refugees from St. Helier (Jersey) were evacuated in three transportsassisted by Dutch schoots on the 20th, and on the 21st there was a similarevacuation from Guernsey. The Governor of Jersey arrived at Portland onthe 21st.French Fleet.12. On receipt of information on the evening of the 22nd, from the british military Liaison Officer at Bordeaux, that France had signed an armistice withGermany, C.-in-C. Portsmouth and C.-in-C. Western Approaches were instructed not to allow French warships at Portsmouth and Plymouth to proceedto sea.13. The Battleship Jean Bart has arrived at Casablanca and the BattleshipRichelieu, after leaving Dakar on the 25th, was recalled there on the 26th. the cruiser Emile Bertin arrived at Martinique on the 26th with bullion.14. The dispositions of the main units are given in Appendix IV. Thesituation with regard to their disposal is still obscure, but the trend of the latest information is that little reliance can be placed on the French navy as a whole to frustrate the terms of the armistice.15. On the 24th the Bordeaux Government instructed all French warships and merchant ships at sea not to proceed to British ports or French Atlanticports, but to go to French North Africa or Mediterranean ports.Other Operations in Home Waters.16. A Canadian troop convoy arrived at Liverpool on the 20th June. Onthe same day seven enerrw destroyers were attacked by a Coastal command aircraft off Terschelling and it was thought that one destroyer was hit.17. On the 21st an enemy gunboat and two merchant vessels were sunk by aircraft at Willemsoord (Texel). On the 22nd five E-boats were attacked by aCoastal Command aircraft off Terschelling without result.18. The Polish Submarine Wilk after suffering damage while on patrol froman external explosion (which caused serious leaks and reduced her speed to4 knots) arrived safely at Dundee on the 25th. The Dutch Submarine O. 13, being-overdue from patrol in the North Sea, is presumed lost.Mediterranean.19. On the 20th June twelve Swordfish of the Fleet Air Arm arrived at malta.20. A force consisting of H.M. Ships Orion, Neptune, Sydney and theFrench Battleship Lorraine, with destroyers in company, carried out a bombard-ment of military objectives at Bardia on the 21st June. Good results were obtained.The French Cruisers Suffren and Duguay-Trouin and British destroyers carriedout a sweep along the coast as far as Mersa Tobruk at the same time without result.21. On the 21st June the floating dock at Malta was bombed by aircraft and badly damaged.
22. H.M. Submarine Odin, which has been operating in the Eastern,Mediterranean, has failed to report and is presumed lost. H.M. SubmarineGrampus is also overdue and must be considered lost.Other Stations.23. On the 23rd June a torpedo air vessel burst on board H.M. DestroyerKhartoum and caused serious damage. She is now beached at Perim and salvageis considered impossible.  Casualties were one killed and three seriously wounded.24. On the same day H.M. Indian Corvette Pathan when off Bombay was seriously damaged by an explosion (cause uncertain) and subsequently sank.Casualties were two officers and three ratings killed and 22 wounded.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.25. This has been intensified throughout the week and particularly off theSpanish coast and in the Western Approaches. Five British ships (34,961 tons)and fifteen others (51,928 tons) were sunk by U-boats. Two neutral ships(12,405 tons) were mined, three British ships (6,856 tons) were torpedoed and sunk by E-boats, one British (7,405 tons) and three others (9,729 tons) were bombed and sunk by aircraft, and three British ships (6,519 tons) and twoNorwegians (4,896 tons) were lost by causes as yet unknown.26. Total tonnage lost amounts to 135,699 tons, of which 55,741 tons wasBritish.   Details are given in Appendix I.Convoys.27. A total of 882 ships, including 142 Allied and 43 neutral, were convoyedduring the week, of which four ships were lost by U-boat action. Eleven armed merchant cruisers, 15 destroyers, 18 sloops and 8 corvettes were employed on escort duties.28. Since the commencement of hostilities 26,355 ships have been convoyed,of which 21,177 were British.29. Imports in the United Kingdom by ships in convoy amounted to959,498 tons. Nineteen tankers brought 219,646 tons of oil, and mineral imports were 255,037 tons. Imports of cereals amounted to 196,576 tons and other food imports were 56,284 tons, of which 10,300 tons were sugar and 20,883 tons wererefrigerated and canned meat.Anti-Submarine Operations.30. Nine attacks on U-boats have been carried out in home waters, oneof which is considered successful and another promising. Anti-submarine patrols have been in operation between Ushant and the Lizard and Ushant andthe Loire. Two destroyers have been hunting a U-boat which was reported tobe interrupting traffic off the mouth of the Gironde. In the MediterraneanH.M. Submarine Parthian reported that she had torpedoed and sunk an Italiansubmarine off the north-east coast of Libya on the 20th June.31. On the 26th June H.M. Destroyer Kingston attacked an Italiansubmarine with gun and depth charge in the southern Red Sea and believesthe submarine was destroyed. On the same day our aircraft attacked submarines in Assab Harbour.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping off the British and French Coasts.32. Minelaying by enemy aircraft has not been as extensive during the week the 19th to 26th June as might have been expected. Portsmouth was subjected to a heavy raid on the night of the 21st/22nd and was closed to all traffic for over six hours. On the 22nd LL trawlers exploded six mines in the approaches,two more being exploded on the 23rd.   The anti-submarine yacht Campeador V,
.3&quot;35degaussed, was mined and sunk to the east of St. Helen&apos;s Road on the 22nd.LL sweep also exploded two mines off Portland during the week. Dover andthe Downs have also been mined by aircraft during the week and LL sweepshave exploded two mines in the Downs and one off Dover.33. On the night of the 25th minelaying was suspected off several of theEast Coast ports, in consequence of which the Tees, Hartlepool and Sunderlandwere closed. Earlier in the week (the 22nd) the French Patrol Vessel La Basiase,degaussed, was mined and sunk close outside the Tees and the river was closedf for over nine hours.34. It is known that a U-boat laid about a dozen mines in the bristol channel at the end of November and it is thought that one of these mines mayhave been responsible for the sinking of the Panamanian James WlcGee on the20th June. A dangerous area was declared after she had been sunk and newsearched channels established. Barry and the ports to the eastward were closedf for about eighteen hours. Further minelaying was suspected off Avonmouth onthe 20th and the port was closed. It was reopened with the other ports onthe 21st.35. U-boats haye been reported or suspected in Belfast Lough and offTfaurso, but the subsequent searching of these areas failed to discover any mines..36. The River Gironde has been visited at least twice by minelayingaircraft during the week. On the 21st June 12 mines were seen to drop betweenLe Verdon, at the mouth of the river, and Pauillac, twenty-five miles up.LL trawlers were operating in the river and off La Rochelle and Bayonne Untilthe evacuation of all British and Allied troops and British refugees had beencompleted.37. The total of magnetic mines dealt with is now 288, of which LL sweepshave been responsible for 144, and skids 49.38. A contact mine was swept in the Flamborough Head area on the19th June. This was probably a mine with a delayed action of about twelve days,since the waters had been frequently swept and in constant use. Sweeping in the would has been started again and one mine was exploded in the sweep on the24th and another cut on the 25th, both close to dangerous area. The total of contact mines cleared is now 424.39. There are now nearly seventy LL trawlers in commission at variousports. LL equipment is to be fitted in eight &quot;Flower &quot; class corvettes whichare under construction.40. A number of French minesweepers, trawlers and other small craft havearrived at English ports. These include electric minesweepers which are beinginspected by the Vernon. The Vernon is to carry out trials in two Dutch schootsto determine whether this type of vessel is suitable for minesweeping in moderate-weather conditions.Enemy Minesweeping.41. Groups of two and three unknown trawlers have been reported by our aircraft operating to the eastward of the Mine Barrier east of Lowestoft. Thetrawlers had paravanes or trawls out, and it is suspected that they were enemy vessels carrying out mine searching operations.Enemy Minelaying in the Mediterranean and British Minesweeping.42. A Greek ship was mined on the 18th June in the Channel betweenSicily and Pantellaria, presumably by a recently-laid Italian mine. The Italianshave declared a dangerous area. New searched channels have been established at alexandria.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping on other Stations.43. Two more mines have been swept in the dangerous area 60 miles north of Auckland, New Zealand, and another field has been discovered by the cuttingof four mines by paravanes in.the eastern approach to Auckland.[21448] B 2
44. A new searched channel has been established at Auckland, and fivesearched channels have been brought into force on the Australian Station.45. Minelaying is suspected off Bombay. If there is a minefield it seems probable that it was laid by the raider responsible for the mines laid off the Capeand New Zealand.British Minelaying.46. 896 mines have been added to the East Coast Barrier, and aircraft have laid mines in the North-West German estuaries and off the Dutch, Flemish andFrench coasts during the period under review.German Merchant Shipping.47. There is little to report about the movements of German merchantshipping during the past week. Traffic continues in the Baltic and in the black Sea, and convoys proceed to and from Norway. There is still a concentra-tion of merchant ships, many of them ex-Norwegian, in the Norwegian fjords,approximately as follows : r6 merchant ships of 2,000-6,000 tons and other smaller vessels atStavanger.6 merchant ships of 1,000-3,000 tons in Bergen Harbour.2 merchant ships of about 4,000 tons in Mo Fjord.These ships have been reported by aircraft, and, though the number is probablycorrect, the size of them may have been over-estimated.48. A report received, dated the 17th June, stated that there was no roomin Dantzig alongside the quays as these were all occupied by German shipsunloading troops and material.49. Two non-German ships are reported to be sailing under the Germanflag. One of these is the British tanker Naphtha Shipper, 5,897 tons, which wasseized at Hamburg on the outbreak of war. She is now reported to have beenrenamed the A Itengamme and to be at Tallinn. The other is the Latvian Venta,1,886 tons, which was detained at Hamburg on the 5th January.50. The Havelland, 6,334 tons, which has been at Mazatlan on the Pacificcoast of Mexico since October, is reported to be loading scrap machinery. Apartfrom this, she shows no sign of activity.Italian Merchant Shipping.51. The Asiatic Petroleum Company has instituted proceedings againstfive Italian ships besides the three mentioned in the report last week. The fivethis week consist of three ships in the United States totalling 17,806 tons, andtwo tankers in Venezuela totalling 11,374 tons. The Conte Biancamano,23,255 tons, upon which an attachment had been made by the Asiatic petroleum company, also has a claim against her by the Royal Netherlands S.S. Company,and the hearing of this latter claim has been fixed for the 6th July. A UnitedStates marshal is on board. The ship, which was at Balboa on the Pacific Coast,passed through the Panama Canal on the 25th June.52. A reliable but unconfirmed report states that the Conte Verde,18,765 tons, which is at Shanghai, has been ordered to fit as an armed merchant cruiser.53. The Caterina Gerolimich, 5,430 tons, was in Dublin on the 19th june and has not yet been reported as sailing.54. The Esquilino, 8,657 tons, which was seized at Aden, may be manned by a Norwegian crew and used as a hospital ship for evacuating casualties fromAden should the necessity arise.55. The Rapallo, 5,812 tons, which is at Cartagena, Colombia, is reportedto have taken 750 tons of water on board, but to have been refused oil fuel. Sixother Italian ships are mentioned as having either arrived in American ports
or moved from one port to another. It is reported from Tampico that some Italiantankers now in Gulf ports will probably be transferred to the Mexican Govern-ment to replace those which are at present being built in Italy for Mexico.56. The Madda, 5,181 tons, which was reported aground on the southern part of Teneriffe, arrived in port there on the 16th June. The Burano, 4,450 tons,arrived at Teneriffe on the 17th June from Aruba with 5,300 tons of crude oil.Enemy Naval Intelligence.German.Main Units.57. An air reconnaissance on the 24th June reported a large warship,described as a battleship, outside Kiel Fjord, and on the same day theuncompleted battleship Tirpitz and the pocket battleship Admiral Scheer were observed in the Bauhaven at Wilhelmshaven. Two destroyers were also seen in dock.58. There has been considerable activity by German E-boats operating fromBoulogne in the current week.Submarines.59. German submarines have been very active in the period under review.From the 21st June to the 24th June there have been six or seven at work in an area which includes the Western Approaches, the Bay of Biscay, off Finisteri*eand the Portuguese Coast. They have extended their operations as far south asLisbon and into the western parts of the Channel.60. Including those on passage out and home, northabout. there has been anaverage of eleven or twelve German submarines at sea.Italian.61. There has been little change in the dispositions of the Italian mainunits since the outbreak of war, except that two 6-inch cruisers, Garibaldi andAbruzzi, which were formerly at Taranto, are probably now at Tobruk. Threebattleships of the Cavour class, four cruisers and ten destroyers were obseiwedsouth of Sardinia steering east on the evening of the 23rd June.62. The Italian submarine which took refuge in Ceuta is now said to have left. Reports of others off Cape Bougeroni and off Algiers have been received,but there is insufficient data to give any general description of their disposition.U.S.S.R. Naval Intelligence.63. Various reports have been received in the last ten days that the hull ofa German cruiser of the Bliicher class, probably the ex-Lutzow, had been seen into off the coast of Estonia and was now believed to be in Leningrad. Theassumption is that the vessel has been sold to the U.S.S.R. as part of thecommercial agreement between the two countries.64. Circumstantial evidence has now been provided by the Naval attache in Moscow indicating that a vessel of the Bliicher type, partially constructed, isin the Baltic Shipbuilding Yard at Leningrad. Two turrets are in place, andthe supports of two others are built. The new Russian cruisers of the Kii:ov classhave so far only carried three turrets.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.Germany.65. The armistice between Germany and France was signed on the-2nd June, and came into force on the 25th June, when an armistice between italy and France had also been signed.
The redistribution of the numerous Italian divisions on the Franco-italian frontier will probably be delayed until the attitude of the French colonial possessions in North Africa becomes definite. Up to the date of the armisticeno major military activity had been reported, and, although the Italians referredmore than once to operations on the Franco-Italian frontier, there is no eon fir ma -tion that they were at any time heavily committed on this front.Mediterranean and Middle East.66. The situation at Gibraltar is reported to be quiet. A number of Britishtroops, R.A.F. personnel and civilians have arrived from Marseilles. Theiraccommodation and maintenance present difficulties and tend to prejudice thesecurity of the fortress. Malta has suffered various air attacks which are described in a later paragraph.67. The 7th Armoured Division has carried out reconnaissances from Egyptover the Libyan border to a depth of 60 miles, in the course of which somearmoured cars have been lost. The area is reported clear of enemy up to about50 miles. The main body of a Libyan division is believed to be located atBir El Gobi, about 60 miles from the frontier.Operations in Libya and Italian East Africa have been confined to minorengagements involving the use by Italy of native troops.68. Between the 19th and the 23rd June mechanised patrols of the SudanDefence Force carried out three further raids across the frontier near Kassala.The enemy suffered severe casualties, amounting to about 100 in one encounter.We had no casualties.69.   On the 26th June the Police detachment at Buramo (on the Somalilandborder south-west of Berbera) withdrew intact after an attack by enemy tanks   &apos;and tribesmen.Central Europe.70. The existence of a training school for parachutists at Varpalota in hungary was reported some time ago, but it is only recently that any details havebeen received. Training, which has lately been speeded up, is stated to followGerman practice and to last three months. Volunteers of varying ages, drawn from the Hungarian Air Force, are taught to jump at five-second intervals. Inaddition, light automatic weapons, machine guns, light field guns, explosives andW/T transmitters are dropped by separate parachutes. The object of the training is stated to be the preparation of parachutists for dropping behind the Roumanianfrontier fortifications and on air ports.Baltic States and Finland.71. There is still little information regarding the future of the armed forcesof the Baltic States, but the wide distribution of the Soviet garrisons must render them helpless. The Commanders-in-Chief of all three countries have beendismissed and replaced by insignificant figures, who will presumably carry out anyorders the puppet Governments may give them.72. It is calculated that the losses imposed on Finland by the war and thepeace terms amount to approximately 30,000 million Fmks., or, say, 150 million, which exceeds the total ordinary revenue of the State for six years.Beset by economic difficulties, Finland appears to live in constant fear offurther Soviet demands. Russian frontier guards have been aggressive andFinnish guards have been killed. Although the Finns have neither retaliatednor protested, they have taken various military precautions and have notdemobilised their armies. No Soviet troop movements towards the Finnishfrontier appear to have taken place, and there is nothing definite to indicatefurther Russian aggression in this quarter. Nevertheless, this possibility cannotbe excluded.Reports have been received of arms traffic between Germany and Finland,but these cannot be taken to imply definite military collaboration between the
AIR SITUATION.General Review.74. Bomber Command has been engaged in the reduction of the scale of air attack on this country. German attacks have continued, though not in great strength, and comparatively little major damage has been done.Our fighters have successfully operated over the French coasts. Coastal Commandhave continued their operations off the Norwegian and Dutch coasts andsuccessfully attacked Scharnhorst. Our operations in the Middle East have continued and reports indicate that the Italian air effort in East Africa hasvirtually collapsed.Great Britain.75. There were extensive enemy raids over Great Britain on the nights ofthe 21st/22nd, 24th/25th, 25th/26th and 26th/27th June. On the first of thesenights about 40 aircraft were engaged, coming from bases in France, belgium and Holland. Bombs were dropped at points on the East Coast from Tynesideto Clacton and, while the enemy&apos;s objectives may have been aerodromes and R.D.F.stations, little damage was done except to small houses, to transport facilities at Grimsby and to electric pylons near Ravenscar. The raiders appear to havedropped bombs from about 10,000 feet, and there was considerable haze at loweraltitudes; our fighters made only one interception, which had no conclusive result.76. On the 24th/25th June bombs are reported to have been dropped byabout 50 aircraft near various aerodromes in East Anglia, near Coventry, Lough-borough and Derby, and at Bristol. At Bristol considerable damage was done to a brewery, a soap works, Ljfsaght&apos;s works, and to a railway station and rolling-stock.77. On the 25th/26th June about 70 enemy aircraft were active, and operated from bases in Germany and Norway as well as in France and the low countries; the coast was crossed at various points as far North as the Firth ofForth, and bombs were dropped in the neighbourhood of Perth, Edinburgh,Hull, Rugby, Portishead, Bristol and Newport. Two aerodromes were attacked and two aircraft were damaged. Considerable damage was done to oil storageat Newport, and bombs fell close to the British Aluminium Co.&apos;s works there;a ship was damaged at Hull. It is believed that five of the enemy were shot down;one of our fighters is missing.78. On the night of 26th/27th June some 70 enemy aircraft again came inat widely separated points of the coast, from Aberdeen to t llG Isle of Wight,and attacked R.A.F. stations and industrial objectives. At Billinghamsubstantial damage was done to a timber canvassed and to the electric plant of theLCI. works; at Middlesbrough the Town Hall and an automatic telephoneexchange were damaged. There were two confirmed and one unconfirmed enemy casualties.79. Minelaying by aircraft has been suspected on various occasions duringthe week, but there has been little enemy activity over our coasts during thehours of daylight. One patrol of the new He. 113 fighters passed over Dover onthe 23rd June and our own fighters claim to have shot one down.two countries. Finland is unlikely, in present circumstances, to do more thantry to maintain her precarious independence, while avoiding further hostilitiesby every means in her power.Far East.73. The Japanese have secured their main requirements regarding the stoppage of arms supplies from Indo-China, the French having agreed to preventthe passage of supplies and to allow Japanese commissions of inspection to supervise the working of the agreement. As the Hong Kong frontier has alsobeen blocked by Japanese action, the only remaining point at issue regardingChinese arms traffic is the Burma-Yunnan road.
80. During the week, Fighter Command flew 364 patrols, involving 738aircraft, over this country. :Attacks on Germany and German-Occupied Territory.81. Bomber Command has concentrated on operations designed to reducethe scale of air attack on this country. Aerodromes, aircraft factories andaluminium works have been attacked, with other industrial and oil targets and communications as secondary objectives. Medium bombers flew 161 daylightsorties, including attacks on objectives in Germany, and 465 night sorties weremade. Weather conditions have frequently prevented the complete success ofdaylight operations, but it has generally been possible to attack secondaryobjectives when lack of cloud cover made it impossible to reach the main target.82. Crews continue to report considerable success and this is confirmedfrom Intelligence sources. The week&apos;s operations are summarised inAppendix VI, which also includes extracts from recent Raid AssessmentReports.   Six aircraft were lost at night, and four in daylight operations.North Sea and Coastal.83. Coastal Command have maintained their operations off the norwegian and Dutch Coasts, including a successful attack on the Scharnhorst, and mine-laying has been continued. Fighter Command are flying considerable and successful offensive patrols over Northern France.84. The most important operation of the week was the attack made onthe Scharnhorst, during its passage south along the Norwegian coast, whichhas already been described in the Naval Situation. Three Beauforts and oneHudson were lost and one Me. 109 was shot down. Attempts to re-establishcontact on the following day were unsuccessful.85. There have been seven submarine sightings during the week and fourattacks, one of which was promising.86. Anti-invasion patrols have been maintained off our own coasts, and regular reconnaissances have been made for movements of shipping along theNorwegian and Dutch coasts. Between the 20th and 23rd a number of enemynaval units were reported and attacked as already described. The attack on enemy destroyers off Terschelling on the 20th was made by one Hudson and pressed home in spite of attacks by four Me. 109&apos;s.87. On the 19th June six Hudsons attacked the inner harbour at Ijmuiden,and damaged warehouses and shipping: on the 22nd June a large merchant shipwith considerable deck cargo was set on fire and sunk off Haugesund; on the25th June a tanker was bombed in Bergen harbour and was probably damaged bynear misses. A small destroyer was seen in the dry-dock at Stavanger on the same day.88. On the 21st June a very successful attack was made on a new enemygun emplacement near Calais by four Skuas and five Rocs, escorted by Hurri-canes; four direct hits were secured. One Roc was seen to fall in the sea. Onthe 24th June an equally successful attack was made by six Hudsons on the occupied aerodrome at de Kooy in Holland, where buildings were destroyed and set on fire. On the same day an Anson on Channel patrol was attacked by four Me. 109&apos;s, and returned safely to its base after shooting clown one of theenemy.89. On the night of the 25th-26th June nine Hudsons raided the newlyconstructed aerodrome at Bomoen, near Bergen, and bombed it heavily from,000 feet; hits were made on the runways and the wooden buildings weremachine-gunned.90. In addition to 36 minelaying sorties flown by Bomber Command, therehave been 13 such sorties by aircraft of Coastal Command, and five sorties to drop &quot; W &quot; bombs.   &apos;91. Daily offensive patrols of our own fighters have been flown over france for reconnaissance and to attack enemy aircraft in the air or on the ground.
Twenty-six patrols, involving 195 sorties, have been despatched in all. On the20th June 40 Junker 52&apos;s were machine-gunned by Hurricanes on the aerodrome at Rouen; four were set on fire and sixteen are believed to have been damaged.On the 22nd June a patrol of nine Hurricanes shot down one Me. 110 (confirmed),one Junkers 52, two Me. 110 and three He. Ill (unconfirmed); one Hurricane is missing and one was damaged.92. On the 25th June nine Spitfires encountered off Calais 17 Me. 109&apos;s,possibly part of the enemy standing patrol. Enemy casualties were threeconfirmed, three unconfirmed. Our pilots report that the Spitfires were greatlysuperior in speed, manoeuvrability and climb.Middle East.93. Our successful air operations have been maintained and reports indicate that the enemy air effort from Italian East Africa may have beenreduced to negligible proportions owing to bad maintenance, poor morale and lack of fuel. Italian aircraft losses are 57 confirmed (excluding 12 damaged)and 12 unconfirmed.Egypt.94. Raids on Italian aerodromes and frontier posts have continued. Onthe 20th June a Blenheim and two Bombays raided El Adem and El Gubbi, and set six bombers on fire, damaging others; one Bombay is missing. Two squadrons of Blenheims repeated these attacks on the following day, and on the23rd June reconnaissance showed that the aerodromes had been largelyevacuated. On the 19th June enemy shipping at Tobruk and Bardia was success-fully reconnoitred, and on the 21st June Blenheims co-operated with naval units in an attack on Tobruk harbour, where one large ship was set on fire. Two enemy fighters were damaged. In the course of a reconnaissance of that area on thesame day a Sunderland was attacked by five fighters; it was itself damaged, butshot down one fighter and damaged two others.95. A submarine was bombed off El Dhaba on the 19th June with promisingresults; and on the 24th June a large encampment at Bir-el-Gosi was raided byeight Blenheims, which achieved complete surprise.96. Italian raids have continued, but have not been very intense. mersa matruh was bombed heavily but without much effect on the night of the20th-21st June, and Alexandria on the night of the 21st-22nd June. Italiancommuniques claim that some of the aircraft engaged against Alexandria were based on the Dodecanese.Sudan.97. There have been sporadic raids on both sides. On the 21st June our aircraft attacked a military encampment at Asosa, and on the 22nd June fiveWellesleys bombed Massawa aerodrome. On the 24th June ten Wellesleys bombedAsmara aerodrome, with considerable success. On the 21st June the wreck ofan Italian submarine was found at Musa Kebir (Red Sea), but an attempt to capture its crew was unsuccessful. The Italians have bombed Kurmak and therailway at Gedaref and South of Ivassala; no substantial damage has been done.Aden and Somaliland.98. The Italians have not been active, apart from a raid on Jibuti by15 aircraft on the 23rd June; they are, however, reported to have raided Berberaand other objectives in British Somaliland on the 19th June. Our own bombershave continued their activities almost unopposed. Repeated raids have beenmade on Assab, Diredawa and Macaaca aerodromes, with good effect. On the25th June a military encampment was attacked; on the 26th June attempts weremade to destroy an enemy submarine in harbour at Assab, and a listening-post atRaheita. A few of our aircraft have been operating from bases in british somali land.Kenya.99. Activity during the week has been slight, apart from two Italian raids,in one of which damage was done to the surface of the aerodrome at Marsabit.[21448] c
M alta.100. Enemy air raids have been fairly continuous, but not in great force,and the only serious damage done has been to the floating-dock, which was sunk.Several civilian casualties have occurred. One three-engined bomber and oneMacchi fighter have been shot down.France.101. Reliable information has been received that the following modernFrench aircraft have been evacuated from France to North Africa, with some,650 personnel: 78 Glenn Martin.39 Douglas D.B. 7.12 Farman 222.125 Dewoitine 520.125 Curtiss 75a.225 Bloch 152.German Air Force.Operations.102. The operational activity of the German Air Force was on a fairly high level at the beginning of the week, when considerable numbers of aircraft were engaged in day and night raids on the Western French ports and on shippingleaving them. Since the 21st there has been a very sharp drop in activity, and itis probable that units are being rested in order to consolidate and to regain ahigh proportion of serviceability. Raids have been directed against objectives inEngland on four nights during the week, but the numbers of aircraft involvedhave never exceeded eighty, and have been drawn only from four of the Germanbomber units.Transport aircraft continue to show considerable activity.Intelligence.103. The fighter defences of the occupied areas in France are being-reorganised, and definite areas have been allotted to various fighter units. Themain areas are as follows : (1) The   Brest   Peninsula  westward  of   Rennes   and   St.   Malo,   withHeadquarters at Rennes.(2) The Cherbourg Peninsula and the West of Normandy, with headquarters at Caen.(3) An area at the mouth of the Seine bounded by a line Deauville- Evreux-Rouen.(4) The coastal area of Northern France from the Somme to the Scheldt.There are two units in this area, based on St. Ingievert and St. Omer.104. There is some evidence that the Me. 110, and possibly the Me. 1.09,might be used as bombers in attacks on this country. The former could be fairlyeasily converted for the purpose, and although the Me. 109 could take only lightbombs, carried externally, it might be possible to use it with effect for low-bombing raids against aerodromes and other ground targets. The speed of both typeswould make them hard to intercept, and they would be difficult targets for anti-aircraft fire.105. German losses from the 10th May to the 25th June, inclusive, amountto 2,192 confirmed and 882 unconfirmed. It is estimated that a further 210 enemy aircraft have been seriously damaged.Italian Air Force.106. Italian air operations and the apparent failure of the Italian air effort in East Africa have already been noted.107. There is no information of any change in the location of units in metropolitan Italy.   The concentration in Sicily remains, and it is fairly certain
[21448]that further reinforcements have arrived from Germany. The activity of this force has been confined to sporadic raids on Bizerta and Malta. It would appearthat the main attack is yet to come, and may be directed against Tunis in theevent of the French authorities there continuing their resistance.108. There is an unconfirmed, but reliable, report that a number of Italianfighter aircraft have gone to Germany.109. A military air service has been established between Libya and italian east Africa, and is operated by night between Cufra and Asmara. reports indicate that an attempt has been made to establish an alternative route fromBenghazi to Asmara; it is not yet known with what success.Spain.110. Summer leave has been stopped for the personnel of the Spanish AirForce in Morocco. A meeting of the Supreme Air Council in Madrid was arranged for the 26th June; the officers commanding the Moroccan, atlantic and Balearic air zones were summoned to attend. Several units of fighters andbombers have been moved to the Levant Coast; regular patrols based on Sevilleare being flown over the Straits of Gibraltar.Far East.111. The Japanese aircraft stationed on the Island of Hainan have been increased from about fifty to over 120. The aircraft based on Gweichow Island,west of Hainan, have also been increased. It is probable that a squadron of lying boats has been transferred to Palau, in the Caroline Islands, which aremandated to Japan. It is thought that this may be a convenient advanced base for any attack on the Netherlands East Indies.112. It is reliably reported that Russian pilots in China are now beingrecalled, although Russian advisers and mechanics will remain. There has beena certain amount of friction recently between the Chinese and Russians; it is,however, probable that the withdrawal indicates only that the pilots are requiredelsewhere.
