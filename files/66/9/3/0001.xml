DE VALERA.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.I circulate herewith for the urgent consideration-ofmy colleagues a Memorandum on negotiations with Mr,. .de valera.(Initialled)    N.C.Privy Council Office.25TH JUNE,  1940.

The Minister of Health has now returned from his second visit to Mr. de Valera and has reported fully to me on his conversations. I need not trouble my colleagues with much of the detail of these, but would draw attention to the main part of the discussion.

Mr. de Valera showed very considerable apprehension at the weakness of Eire&apos;s position in face of a possible German invasion. In the course of their talk Mr. MacDonald asked him whether there were any circumstances under which the Government of Eire would be prepared now, before a German invasion started, to invite our ships into their ports and our soldiers and aeroplanes into their territory, and to take vigorous action against the Fifth Column in Eire. There followed a long discussion in which three alternative possibilities were examined. The three alternative possibilities were as follows:-

1. That there should be a declaration of a united Ireland in principle, the constitutional and other practical details of the Union to be worked out in due course; Ulster to remain a belligerent, Eire to remain neutral, at any rate for the time being; if both parties desired it, a joint Defence Council to be set up at once; at the same time, British naval ships to be allowed into Eire ports, British troops and aeroplanes to be stationed at certain agreed point in the territory, the British Government to provide additional equipment for Eire&apos;s forces, and the Eire Government to take effective action against the Fifth Column.

Mr. de Valera emphatically rejected this suggestion, saying first, that the admission of British forces into the territory and territorial waters of Eire before a German invasion had started would be regarded by a large part of his own people as an abandonment of strict neutrality and a provocation to Germany. The result would be that national unity in the face of the German threat would be broken. Secondly, that if British troops did come into Eire under those circumstances, there would be a grave danger of shots being fired on them by extremists, and of most unfortunate skirmishes between Irish and the British. This, Mr. de Valera said, would be the view of his Government as well as of himself.

2. That Eire and Ulster should be merged in a United Ireland, which should at once become neutral; its neutrality to be guaranteed by Great Britain and the United States of America; since Britain was a belligerent its military and naval forces should not take any active part in guaranteeing that neutrality, but American ships could come into the Irish ports, and perhaps American troops into Ireland, to effect this guarantee.

This suggestion was made by Mr. de Valera, but rejected firmly by Mr. MacDonald for a number of reasons which are obvious.

-----   - &apos;*      15TLu- cnoro should be a deolaraion- of a Unitgg,freland&quot;&quot;&quot;iri principle the constitutional and.practical details of the Union to he worked out indu? course r^jthis. united Ireland to become ato&quot;n&quot;c&apos;e&quot; a&quot;&quot;&quot;beiTigerent on the side of the Allies.On this, Mr. de Valera said that if there were not only adeclaration of a united Ireland in principle, but also agreement upon its constitution, then the Government of Eire might agreeto enter the war at once.     He could not be certain about this.Perhaps the existing Government would not agree to it, and would bereplaced by another Government which did-.Mr. MacDonald replied that,  quite apart from other difficulties, he saw two practical objections to Mr. de valera&apos;suggestion.     First, he saw no chance of a constitution being prepared and agreed to In the short time which might be at outrdisposal before invasion took place, and secondly, the Governmentin London could not be satisfied with a vague assurance that t*heEire Government &quot;might&quot; enter the war, since again the issue waftsurgent., and they could not approach the Ulster authorities withany proposal of the kind suggested unless they had a firmassurance that the Government of Eire would, in fact, come intothe war.Mr. de Valera replied that he could not go further than &quot;mighit&quot;,with a big question mark after that &quot;might&quot; .     When Mr, MacDonaldasked whether he could report that this was the view not only ofMr. de Valera himself, but also of the other members of hisGovernment, Mr. de Valera after some hesitation said that he wouldcast his own vote that way, but that perhaps some of his colleagues would take a different view.      But he did not think they would.His chief reason for this attitude was that their people were really almost completely unprepared for war.      They had not awell-equipped army, nor had they guns to resist tanks and mechanisedtroops.     Dublin was practically an undefended city, where therewere only a few anti-aircraft guns and no air raid shelters or gasmasks for the citizens.      The people would be mercilessly exposed to the horrors of modern war, and he could not have it on hisconscience that in this state of affairs he had taken theinitiative in an action which led to war.      If the initiative were taken by German invaders, that was another matter.      He and his people would resist bitterly.Mr. MacDonald answered that the Government in London wouldsympathise with Mr. de Valera^s position,    and would not-2-

wish him to declare war without proper defence precautionsbeing taken,    The suggestion which they were discussingforeshadowed an agreement with the Government of Eire that theywould enter the war on our side0    That would alter our attitude on the question of equipment for Irish forces.    We could thenpresumably send our ships forthwith into their ports, and our troops and aeroplanes to join with the Irish soldiers in.defending strategic points.,    We should feel that we hadassurance then which would enable us to send such guns, rifles and ammunition, and such gas masks and other equipment forpassive defence as we could spare consistently with the defenceof our own islandsMro  de Valera did not alter his view, and said that hewould report the conversation to his Cabinet colleagues.The position therefore is that, although we know Mr.  deValera5 s own attitude to the third of the alternatives sketchedabove, we are not certain what would be the attitude of his cabinet as a wholeo    Sir John Maffey&apos;s view is that they wouldhave been ready to agree to such a proposal two or three months ago, but that their views have been somewhat influenced by therecent German successes.,    Nevertheless, he thinks there is a chance that some of them would be prepared to support adeclaration of war on these conditions now.    I suggest that weshould test this,:,    It is important to examine fully everypossibility of getting our ships into the Irish ports and our troops into Eire ahead of a German invasion.    It would appearthat the Government of Eire - who are now fully aware of the imminent danger of invasion - may be considerably influenced byany promise of military equipment that we are able to make tothem, and I have consulted the Chiefs of Staff on this.    As aresult, I propose that we should address a communication toMr.  de Valera which would proceed to ask him definitely whatwould be the attitude of his Government to the following plan,to which, if it were accepted, the Government in London would do their best to obtain the assent of the Ulster Government.(l) A declaration of a united Ireland in principle.(S) A joint body including representatives of the Government of eire and Northern Ireland to be set up at once to work outthe constitutional and other practical details of theUnionc-   The Government in London to give such assistance as might be desiredo(5) A joint Defence Council to be set up immediately.(4) Eire to join the war on our side forthwith and for thepurposes of the defence of Eire, permission to be givenfor British naval vessels to have the use of SouthernIrish ports and for British troops and aeroplanes to be stationed in such positions in Eire as may be agreed withthe Eire government(5) The Eire Government to intern all enemy aliens in the countryand 00 take   any stept necessary to suppress Fifth Columnactivities,,(6) The British Government to provide equipment as early asPc &apos;Sible to the Eire Government in accordance with thepa; ticulars,.givon in the Appendix.

If this proposal commends itself to the War Cabinet,I would suggest&quot; that Mr. MacDonald. should be invited to talcethe communication to Dublin himself and to await there the reply of the Eire Government.If that reply should be favourable I do not believethat the Ulster Government would refuse to play their part in bringing about so favourable a development.    But I am &quot;bound tosay that I hardly anticipate anything but a negative answerand in that case I am afraid that I cannot malce any furthersuggestion than that we should continue our present efforts toimprove relations and pursuade the Eire Government to talte such further steps for their own protection as they may be willingto adopts

mII.  ^IR FORCE IvLiTERIiJj.1, In general, we should he prepared to offer anyaircraft which the Government of Eire could man and maintain.2. In particular, it is understood that Eire have aCadre fighter squadron, which includes four Gladiators.      Weshould he prepared to make up that squadron to a first-line strength of 12 Gladiators with the necessary immediatereserve.      It could he pointed out that this type iseminently suitable for dealing with enemy troop carriers andis being successful in shooting down enemy bombers in malta and the Middle East.If Eire press for a more modern type, we could agreeto make available 6 Hurricanes to begin with, with more tofollow when they have pilots and maintenance crews trainedto deal with this type.3. If more is asked for, we could offer up to a maximum of 12 Battle medium bombers.      If, as seems unlikely, Eireask for a more modern type, we could agree to make available a limited number of Wellingtons, but it should be pointedout that Wellingtons need a highly trained crew consistingof 2 pilots, a navigator and 3 air gunners, which Eire couldnot provide.4. Eire have a limited number of Lysanders.      If theypress for more we could make available six, which is probablyall, or more, than they could find the crews for.5. In supplying these aircraft, we should, of course,also supply the necessary ancillary equipment, includingbombs, machine guns and ammunition.6. If Eire raise the question of sending people over here to be trained in our operational units, we shouldpresumably have to agree, although we should be reluctant todo so since it would mean a reduction of the number of pilots going through to our own first-line units.NOTE:   We are not,  of course, particularly anxious to release either Hurricances or Battles and should beprepared to do this only in view of the importance of theobject in view.
