S E q r E T.WiPi(4Q)825^ COPY NOi27TH JUNE.1940 ^.   war Cabinet.VISIT TO; FRENCH MOROCCO.REPORT BY THE MINISTER OP INFORMATION *In accordance with, the decision of theWar Cabinet of 25th June I left London with Lord Gortand my private secretary, Lord Hood,  at YiQ a.mi  on26th June and arrived at Rabat at 7.0 p*miThe first flying boat ever to land on the narrowwaterway attracted a large crowd, who were rewarded bythe spectacle of an admirable landing performed indifficult circumstances.      The crowd, however,  seemedquiet and depressed, flags were flying at half mast andthere was no sign of welcome.After some  delay a party of young French officers,who happened to be passing in a boat,  took us ashore.Brigadier Lord Dillon,  liaison officer with General Nogues(was on the quay and warned us not to expect a favourablereception.      He told us that General Nogues himself wasat Algiers and that his deputy M* Morize was determinedthat we should see nobody of importance.An officer of the French Air Force then arrivedand invited Lord Gort to call on his commanding officer.He did his best to ignore my presence.I went to the Consulate General where I learntthat they had telegraphed that morning advising againstmy visit and also that the French ex-Ministers were onboard a ship at Casablanca.      At my request the ConsulGeneral telephoned to the Consul  at Casablanca sayingthat I was anxious to see M.  Mandel and would go thereat any time he liked,  either that evening or the nextmorning.      The telephone was probably tapped for shortlyTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this docunrn
afterwards Monsieur Morize rang up Mr. Hurst to saythat he had received instructions that I was not tohold any communication with the French ox-ministers and that ho hoped I would comply and not place- him Inthe awkward position of having to take action whichwould be most distasteful to him.      I replied that Iwas sorry not to have given him longer notice of myarrival end asked if I could come to see him.Monsieur Morize agreed to receive me and I went atonce to his office;      He was in a highly nervous andemotional state but he received me with courtesy.    I told him that I had hoard that certain distinguishedformer Ministers of France had arrived in Morocco andas they were all known to me personally, I had withthe approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government come out inorder to discuss with them the present situation andto enquire whether in their opinion there was any possibility of carrying on the war in North Africa,He replied that in the opinion of the French Governmentthe greatest misfortune that could now befall france was any division in the ranks, which would lead tothe crumbling away of the whole country.      What yetremained must stick together.-    When I attempted toput forward another view, ho fell back upon a strongerline of defence - namely,  that he was merely anofficial and as such was obliged to obey his instruc-tions, however distasteful they might be.      He saidthat if General Nogues ordered him to shoot himselfhe would obey, but the orders that he had were evenmore cruel.      The ex-Ministers were old friends ofhis and he had recently been serving under theirox^ders.      But as things were at present he had no option but to obey his instructions and he countedon me to do likewise.In these circumstances, I considered that anyattempt to see M. Mandel was bound to fail and might lead to an unpleasant incident.      I therefore abandoned the Idea&apos;and sent instead a cipher message throughthe Consul at Casablanca explaining the position toM. Mandel and saying that I hoped ho would come to gibraltar or to England and that I would arrange thenecessary transport.Lord Gort had,  in the meantime, gone to the hotel where we were proposing to spend the night andhad there been joined by our Pilot, who had been prevented from rejoining the flying boat by an armed guard.When Lord Gort left the hotel to come and joinme where I was dining, he was accosted by a policemanwho said that he had orders to stop him leaving the hotel.

Lord Dillon immediately telephoned Monsieur Moriae andprotested in no uncertain terms.-,    The policeman re-appeared and said that he had received instructions that lord Gort could now leave the hotel0   Accordingly Lord Gortand Lord Dillon joined me and we discussed the situation,.We decided thats  in view of Lie Morize&apos;s attitude and instructions,, it wars no use remaining in Rabat, or going toCasablanca0    It seeued equally fruitless to go to Algiers,where a committee of prominent citizens are trying toorganize continued resistance., until Lord Dillon had as-certained whether   General Nogues! attitude was likely tochangeQ    \Hes therefore.,  decided to leave at dawn forGibraltars where we could await a reply from Monsieur handelor any other aevelopments0 .At midnight we received a message that MonsieurMorize was waiting at the British Consulate to present hisapologies to lore!. Gort,    These apologies were duly accepted and I said that the incident was closedo    I found at theConsulate the reply to my first message to MG Mandela    Itwas to the effect that he was under surveillance,  could not see me that nighty  and was doubtful about the next day0We then returned to the flying boat? which seemed to be thesafest place to spend the night0We flew to Gibraltar at dawn the next morning andthere discussed, the situation at length with the governor and Admiral Sir Dudley North,,    As a result of our discussion,I sent a further message to Casablancas stressing theimportance of getting M0 Mandel to England,  and instructingthe Consul to discuss ways and means of doing so with the captain of the British destroyer lying off the porto    Inthe course of the day,, I received word that it had been impossible to deliver my second message to Mc Maudel, ashe was now virtually a prisoner on board ship and all communications were closely watchedo    Later I sawCaptain Holland., who had just returned from Casablanca, andhad seen M0 Ivlandel the day before^    The latter was anxious tocome to England with his whole party? MP Campanchi, Delbos,Daladier and their :C1,3.leri and various military andtechnical advisers - about 50 in all, but they could not do so in their present ship as the captain has orders notto leave Casablanca0    Arrangements will therefore be madeto bring them off in a British ship if,, as I am afraid now seems unlikely,; the French authorities will allow them togOoI received an extremely abrupt message from the consul General at Rabat, stating that the ex-Ministers wereremaining on board ship,  and seeming to imply that theship was bound for America - but this seems to me doubtful.Lord Dillon returned during the day to Algiers, where hetelegraphed to say that he had passed General Nogues inthe air, who had flown back to x?abat0    Lord Dillonadvised Lord Gort and myself to return to London, whichwe had already decided to do0    We accordingly sailed at5p30 aom0(INTLD,)    Do0oinistry of Information,,S7TH JUNE, 1940o
