No. 340 Most Secret.Following for Prime Minister.     Begins.GERMANY.We have been considering possibility that Herr Hitler may shortly launch plan for a European, if not world-wide economicconference, a move which would not necessarily interfere with,any military operations which he has in view-    He would no doubtrepresent himself as founding a new European economic system,which would sweep av/ay the customs barriers, quotas,  currencyrestrictions, wastefulness and inefficiency of an anachronisticcapitalist system, and all other obstacles which have preventedefficient European, economic co-ordination.     He would promise &apos;that, this economic unit once established,  all would share inthe wealth and resources of Europe as a whole within the framework, of course, of an all-embracing and benigntotalitarian system.It is obvious that he could make great play with all thisamong most neutrals and some belligerents, particularly inSouth America and in overseas possessions of Prance, Belgium and holland,
Holland,. who are longing to get back to normal peace-time regime.Moreover, it would be easy for him &quot;to represent that sole barrier tohis new economic paradise was obstinacy and selfishness of GreatBritain, who not merely refused to co-operate, but by hercontinuance of the war, particularly by her blockade, wasdemonstrably bent on reducing the greater part of the world toruin.We are putting these considerations to the United States,Government and suggesting advisability of concerting with themanticipatory counter-offensive.     For example, we might discusslikelihood of Herr Hitler dressing up German and Nazi Fascistdomination in the guise of an economic paradise.     We could showthat it is merely a device to harness all European wealth and production to the Hazi chariot wheels - an extended German&quot;autarky&quot; for military aggrandisement of the  &quot;superior&quot; Germanrace and for the suppression of freedom everywhere.      We could,demonstrate that German economic domination invariably meansGerman political domination,,To these somewhat negative arguments it would be necessaryto add something more positive, defining advantages of theinternational economic structure which the United States and we wish to emerge as part of the peace settlement.    It is in thisparticular direction that we are inviting suggestions fromthe United States President and Secretary of State.     We would hope, with them to make clear that our aim is to break downartificial barriers to trade, which impede any general rise inthe standard of living and that we are convinced that this can only be achieved by free peoples,  freely negotiating onan.equal basis and. animated neither by ideological passionnor political ambition.Our idea would be that speeches might be made byleading politicians on both sides of the Atlantic embodying the foregoing arguments and any others which the United states secretary of   State may care to, suggest.
Cypher telegram from the Minister of External Affairs,Pretoria, to the High Commissioner,London.Dated 17th July, 19kO.    Received- 6 p.iru 17th July.No.5^7*  Secret.I Leg to submit the following for you and theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs on Circular D. 3L0.Circular B.3h0 of June 25th raises a very important point which has troubled me for some time.      It is mostp.robable that Hitler will start a peace offensive at an earlydate.      This may be either for a conference or some other form of peace propaganda.      It may come before or after anattach on Britain.      Personally,  I am inclined to be doubtful about such an attack, at any rate for the present.      with british naval supremacy unimpaired it would be the wildestgamble.      If the German air force could do more than it didin the supreme effort at Dunkirk I do not see how far themore formidable enterprise of Britain&apos;s invasion against british air and naval defence could -succeed.      Hitler&apos;sadvisers must know this.It is therefore quite possible that an alternative plan is being contemplated.      That is an attempt for thefurther encirclement of Britain by capturing the faroe islands and Iceland on %&apos;he right flank and Spain, portugal and Gibraltar on the left.      The Germans will then haveisolated Britain from Europe especially if the surrender of gibraltar means also the retirement of the British Navy fromthe Mediterranean and the loss of the Middle East.     Withpractically the whole of Europe in Hitler&apos;s hands and Russiaand the Balkans in his pocket before winter comes he may thenthink the auspicious moment has come to launch his peace offensive..   He will pose as the regenerator of an effeteEuropean system and will propose a United States of Europecomposed of so called free states between whom tariff wallsand economic barriers will have been abolished and only some such Schacht currency plan will exist.      Being in fact master of Europe, Hitler can afford to restore the semblance of freedom to his victims.      America will be plausibly remindedof her own Monroe Doctrine.      In fact, however, theContinent will become a closed German market from which britain and America will be largely excluded.Some such scheme could be clothed in suchplausible appearances as to make a formidable appeal to world public opinion already sickened of the horribledestruction of the war, and the spectre of the comingEuropean famine.      If,  in addition. Hitler is big enoughto renounce annexations and indemnities, its appeal may become Irresistible and make Europe accept.a peace whichwill be a moral and political disaster of the first water.The problem is how to meet such a peace offensiveif and when it comes.      I think suggestion for Americanconsultation
consultation and. agreement&apos; on a positive alternateplan will be essentialc      A warning note in advance in the press and on platform in both countries would&quot;also help to prepare public opinion against thispeace manoeuvre.      Advance ridicule may take muchsting out of it.The problem is, however, a very serious one and I would advise that in addition it be submitted to special committees of first rate minds in both countries&apos;for their careful exploration in all its aspects.We have been surprised at every, stage of the war and should now take every precaution not to he surprised into a fatalpeace.Let brain trusts be set going to work out analternate democratic plan for countering a peace movementwhich is certain to come sooner or later arid, should find usprepared with the answer.
