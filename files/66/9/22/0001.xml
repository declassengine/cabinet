(THIS DOCUMENT IS tjke PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT)secret.P.(40) 2422nd July 1940Copy Nod key.TO rp jfivr-cabinetIU BE kbr^unpe-;-! lock anit is requested that special care may be taken toonsupQ the secrecy of this document.par past - future policy memorandum by the Secretary oT State for Burma.I fear that the suggestion mentioned in the cabinet minute No.12 of W.M.(40) 189th Conclusions that we might agree to ration the traffic over the Burma-China road, thoughit might serve to protract discussion would involve, verygreat difficulties if an attempt were made to put it intopractice.The Japanese have asked that a stop should be put &quot;to&quot;transportation via Burma not only of arms and ammunition but&quot;also of transport supplies, such as fuel, fuel oil,&quot;especially gasoline, trucks and railway materials1&apos;.So far as concerns arms and ammunition, trucks (whichpresumably covers &quot;motor omnibuses&quot; and lorries) and railwaymaterials, the source of supply is certainly outside burma and now almost wholly U.S.A.     To attempt to ration the transportation of these articles at the entrepot stage wouldseem likely to lead to difficulties with&quot;the exporters aswell as with all other parties interested.   It would seem that any effective rationing could only be imposed on theexporter, i.e. U.3.A.Petrol and lubricating oil present a rather specialaspect of the problem.   The petrol at any rate - but to aless extent lubricating oil - which enters China from Burmais the produce of Burma; but owing to the marketing arrange-ments between the various big oil companies, as a result ofwhich the China market is closed to the Burmah Oil company and reserved for Standard and Shell and affiliated concerns,,,the petrol actually produced in and supplied from Burma issold in China as the produce of and for the account of standard or Shell as the case may be.    (The arrangementsrequire that an equivalent amount shall be put by these companies on the Indian market for the account of the BurmahOil Company which has a reserved position in that market.)An undertaking to ration the supply of petrol, etc., overthe Burma route would therefore seem to require the acceptance by Standard, and/or Shell of some limitation of quantities tobe sold; tha-fe is to say, in this case also, but in a more complicated way, the ration would be imposed on the (nominalbut not the actual) exporter.   Very possibly the Burmah oil company could, if so requested by His Majesty&quot;s Government,refuse to implement any order accepted by standard/Shell,beyond a certain figure: whether this is so could be ascertained from the Burmah Oil Company.   Even if a rationing system could be and were imposed on the exporter, still moreif it were attempted to be made effective at the transit stage(i.e. Burma) only, there would be constant occasion for doubt whether the imports to Rangoon were not in excess of the quotaoperative at the moment, with consequent enquiries as to whatwas being done about the excess.
It seems to me therefore that the practical outcome of the suggestion of a rationing system must inevitablyand by rapid stages be to lead the Japanese to press forrights of inspection and control in Burma - and in a recenttelegram Sir a. Cochrane made plain his view that &quot;theeffect of giving any power of supervision to the JapaneseConsul in Rangoon, which would be interpreted as giving him virtual control over the transit trade, would bedeplorable.&quot;It is not impossible that if we gave way to theJapanese demand to the extent of undertaking to impose a rationing system - despite the practical difficulties -the Japanese would be constantly pressing for a reductionof the agreed ration of this or that article..   In theevent we should be driven by stages each involvingconsiderable friction with all parties, to stoppage of the transit of articles selected by the Japanese for stoppage -or alternatively to have to take a stand on points of detail rather than of principle.   That being so I believe the safer course, and the one involving least danger of friction, is to take our stand on the broad ground ofprinciple.L.S.A.BURMA. OFFICE.2nd July 1940.
