The situation in Iraq remains unsatisfactory.Conditions have deteriorated and. anti-British propagandasencouraged by the collapse of Prance and the entry ofItaly into the war, is. increasing.      The prestige of the axis Powers is high., while that of the Allies is correspond-ingly low.      The War Office has discussed with the ForeignOffice what steps should be taken to improve matters.      Inthe. Opinion of the Foreign Office, if heavy pressure was  .brought to bear on the Iraq Government to take actionagainst the supporters of our enemies, the Government mightfall and a situation would arise in which we might be compelled to send troops into the country to restore order.To prevent such an event, the Foreign Office would liket* see British forces in Iraq now.5. The factors on which a decision must depend are:-(a) We are now at war with Italy, and our communi-caticns through the Red Sea are by no meanssecure.     Although our recent&apos;successes have reduced the threat from submarines, theItalians are now free to increase theirAir Forces in East Africa to the limitimposed by maintenance difficulties.      Theair threat to shipping at.the southern endof the Red Sea is in consequence likely toincrease.      The overland route through Iraqfrom Basra to Palestine becomes, therefore,W.P.

increasingly Important for the transportationof personnel and material.      The IraqArmy is responsible for the protecti*n-of the railway from Basra to Bagdad, but inpresent circumstances its reliability Isdoubtful.(b) It may be necessary to maintain internal security in Iraq.(c) Should conditions demand it, we may have tomove rapidly to protect the Abadan, refineryagainst sabotage.(d) The move of forces from the Middle East to Iraqwould be regarded by the Arab States as a sign of weakness 9 and might have an effectexactly opposite to that desired.      If,however, the troops come from the East   .they will be a clear addition to our strengthand it will be possible to suggest thatthey are intended as an earnest of our intention to fulfil our treaty with Iraq,F^r these reasons the presence of British forcesin Iraq are necessary to safeguard our military interests,to show that we intend to honour our treaty obligations andto make it clear to the Iraqis that the British Empireis a force with which to reckon.      The presence of Britishtroops would encourage our well-wishers and, conversely.,have a deterrent effect on the supporters of our enemies.4. India is preparing a division for despatch to Iraqwhen need arises.     The move of the first echelon of this force, comprising an infantry brigade and attached troops,to Basra can be completed, provided shipping is available,in thirty days.5. The role of a force sent to Iraq would be, acting under the Treats?- and in co-operation, where possible, withthe Iraqi forces:-(i) To stiffen the morale of the Iraqi Governmentand to induce it to take action against the supporters of our enemies.(ii) To establish a &quot;bridge-head&quot; at Basra and beready to send a detachment to protect theAbadan refinery against sabotage.(ill) By its presence In the Basra area to deter hostile Iraqi elements frominterrupting the line of communicationoverlarid to Palestine..T-he -despatch of one -brigade group as soon as possible,followed by the remainder of the division by September-,hculd ih favourable circumstances toe sufficient to achieveTttree -three&apos; objects. *

&amp;o To assist the Iraq.! Government to msJLXsSraxZL-i^0^^^security throughout Iraq would be &quot;heyojad the capacity qf&apos;a single divisionc.      The internal security commitmentmight become a heavy one;    In the Iraq Rebellion of 1920the equivalent of some four divisions was required to restore the situation,,      Should a similar situationarise in the near future,  it is unlikely that any further reinforcements could be made available,      It would thenbe impossible to operate the overland route, and the division would be restricted to the role given inparagraph 5(ii) above.      Reinforcements would berequired from India as soon as they could be provided,but this is unlikely to be before the Spring of 1941.7, As the Indian Government will remain responsiblefor the supply and maintenance of all forces sent from india to Iraq, it is desirable that the possible extentof the commitment should be appreciated by the indian government at the outsets      Plans for reinforcement,supply and maintenance can then be made accordingly.80 In spite of the danger of entailing a growingcommitment 5 the time has now come to move forces from india into Iraq0     Action now may prevent a serious,situation;    if we do nothing we may be faced with theneed of occupying the country in strength later on,90 Provided therefore that the Iraqi Government&apos;sreactions to the proposals, are favourable, as from consideration of Sir Rc Newton&apos;s telegram No. 285dated 22nd June, 1940. we believe they will be, werecommend that the Government of India should now beasked to send one division to Iraq, the first echelon ofwhich (comprising an Infantry Brigade and attached troops)should leave as soon as possibles(Signed) 0 oL.N.
