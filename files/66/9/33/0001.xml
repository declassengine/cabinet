COPY NO__NORTHERN BARRAGE AND OTHER MINING REQUIREMENTS AT HOME.Memorandum &quot;by First Lord of the Admiralty.At their meeting held on 30th November, 1939,the War Cabinet took the following decisions (W.M.(39)99th Meeting)i!(i)      That preparations should be put in handforthwith for the laying of the NorthernBarrage, on the general lines proposedin paper W.P. (39; 126.(ii)     That no announcement should be made at thepresent time in regard to this project.(iii)      That a decision should be deferred as to the dates (a) at which the area concerned should be notified as a dangerous area,and (b) at which the laying of mines should begin. &quot;2. With the loss of Norv/ay , the project originallyapproved is no longer suitable since, now that Germany isin possession of the eastern end of the proposed minefield,she could always maintain a swept passage at her own end and would have no need to pass her ships through the minedarea at all.3* The need to control the northern exit from theNorth Sea to the Atlantic, however, remains, andfortunately an area of mineable water exists extendingalmost right across from Scotland to the Faroes, from the faroes to Iceland and from Iceland to Greenland.    the faroes and Iceland are now in our possession and it isconsequently now proposed to lay the Northern Barrage onthis line.h. The distance is considerably greater than in theoriginal project;   but a large number of mines are in course of manufacture and, by accepting a lesser densityof the minefield, a sufficiently effective barrier can belaid without increasing the number of mines.

5. When this barrier is laid, entry and exit fromthe North Sea to the Atlantic can be controlled and thework of our Northern Patrol, which already carries out its operations on the Faroes-Iceland line, will be muchfacilitated.6. The mere declaration of the area in question as a mined area will have a considerable deterrent effecton the passage of shipping through these waters.    It isonly a very determined merchant ship   which deliberatelysteams through an area which has been declared to be mined and the existence of the minefield would also undoubtedlyincrease the difficulties before a German warship wishing to break out into the Atlantic.7. Further, should Germany intend to launch an expedition from Norway to Ireland or the west coast ofthis country, the declaration of the minefield at thisstage will probably cause her to hesitate considerably asit is unlikely that plans for the expedition would inclu.deprovision for minesweeping or the fitting of vessels withanti-mine devices.8. In addition to the laying of this re-sited NorthernBarrage, we have now two other considerable rainingrequirements in home waters -(i)     To extend our east coast barrier furthernorthward.(ii)      to lay a south coast harrier.9. At first sight it might seem desirable to commence work on the south coast barrier before that inthe north.    With the present short nights, however, thereare very grave risks in operating these new large minelayersin the southern area, especially as the base for theminelaying must remain at the port in western Scotlandwhich has already been fitted out.    No change in thesituation of the base would be practicable at this stageeven if the southern area were reasonably safe frombombing attack..10. The mines will shortly be coming forward at ahigh rate and it is essential that they should be laidas fast as they are delivered.    Otherwise great difficultiesof storage, accommodation and rail facilities would arise.11. Laying will commence about the middle of july and will take place in the following order(i)     The first lay in the southern area of theNorthern Barrage, so that a trial lay may take place in waters comparatively shelteredfrom enemy action.(ii)      The completion of the northern end of theeast coast barrage.

(iii)     Continuance of the Northern Barrage at a steady rate as mines come forward.(iv)     Work to start on the southern barrage shouldone be found necessary as soon as the lengthof the night permits and with regard to theair situation at the time.12. It is proposed that the Northern Barrage area should be declared forthwith in vie?/ of the great deterrent effect that this declaration is likely to have.I ask the Cabinet to approve the foregoingproposals.A. V. A.ADMIRALTY, S.W.I.7th July, 1940.
