Hv.PROPOSED DECLARATION OP DANGEROUS AREAS OFF COAST OF ITALYAND COLONIES.Memorandum by First,: Lord of the Admiralty. -The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean has raised two important questions c oncer nigh.; the conduct of the war in theMediterranean, - the interruption of Italian communications withLibya and the exercise of contraband control in the Eastern.Mediterranean,2. The interruption of Italian communications with Libyais likely to become a matter of great importance in the futurebecause of the threat to which Egypt would be exposed if theItalians attempted to convey large mechanised forces across the seato Libya.     The Italians ahvc recently issued a notice to theeffect that any ships bound for a hostile port in the mediterranean and navigating within 30 miles of hostile coasts will do so at theirperil.    We propose to issue in regard to the Libyan coast a similarnotice, to the effect that all vessels navigating within 30 miles of the Libyan coast will do so at their peril. The Commander-in-Chief will then issxie instructions to his submarines to sink atsight all vessels in this area.    The danger of sinking a neutralship would be so small that we think it can be accepted.3. With regard to the exercise of contraband control in theEastern Mediterranean I understand that the Ministry of economic warfare think it exceedingly important to prevent the sailing toItaly of ships carrying oil (and also wheat and to a lesser extentother commodities) from the Black Sea.  Since Italy&apos;s entry into thewar this route has not been used by the Italians, but they may atany tine begin to use it again. The traffic must pass either throughthe Corinth Canal or through the channels which lie on either sideof Crete.    The Corinth Canal traffic presents a problem which isunder examination by the Commander-in-Chief. For the present our object is to control the traffic through the channels. This objectcan be achieved by declaring all the waters within 30 miles of italian territory as dangerous to navigation. This declaration would bo no more extensive than the Italian declaration referred toin paragraph 2 above. It is proposed to omit from it any referenceto Greek territorial waters. We may assume that it would have a deterrent effect sufficient to prevent neutral shipping from usingthese channels. If later we find that they continue to use it,consideration would hove to be given to the question of closing the channels by more drastic action.h* As the declaration would cover all the channels betweenCrete and Turkey,  its effect would be to force all shipping (apartfrom the Corinth Canal traffic)  to pass through the channel be-twoen Cape Ma lea and Crete. We should establish an intermittentsurface patrol over this channel, and we should also operatesubmarines in the area, with instructions to act in accordance withthe principles of submarine warfare&apos; to which we have subscribed.ADMIRALTY, S.W.I.10th July, 19hO.a.v.a.TKJJSJDpj^ BRITANMCt HA J5STY&apos; JL GOygRKMgNT.,TO.
