Proposed re-draft of passages on Hongkong and Burmain draft telegram to Tokyo in W,P,(40) 23 U of 29th June,B. Passage of supplies through HongkongThe transit of munitions over the frontier of Hongkonghas in fact heen prohibited since January 1939 and no war materials of any kind are at present crossing the frontier.In these circumstances it would seem, that the Japaneserequirements have already been met.C. Stoppage of supplies to China through BurmaHis Majesty&apos;s Government have taken note of the views ofthe Japanese Government with regard, to the transport of arms,ammunition and supplies via Burma to the National Governmentof China,It Is true that the passage of certain arms and munitions to the National Government of China does take place via Burma,hut the total figures for 1939 and those for the first five months of 1940 lend no support to the view that this trafficaffords any very material contribution to the armed strengthof the Chinese National Government.     Por some time past the specific war material from the United Kingdom wkntih was carried overthe Burma route to China has been insignificant, and. it is likelyto remain so.     His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore would find themselves unable to accept the view that the&apos; supply of war materials by Great Britain to the National Government of china is a direct cause of the prolongation of the hostilities.It Is however noted that the Japanese Government in theircommunication refer not only to arms and. ammunition, hut also tofuel, fuel oil and petrol, trucks and railway materials.     HisMajesty&apos;s Government find difficulty in appreciating the basis onwhich the request is made to stop the passage of these materials,certain of which are products of Burma itself.   In so far as this route is a legitimate trade route which contributes to the welfare of the people of Burma and India, His Majestv&apos;s Government feelthat in making this request the Japanese Government areasking them to take action which is inconsistent with their obligations to these two countries.    . Moreover the goods whichpass over this route to China emanate from third Powers and ifserious dislocation is not to be caused, to the trade of those powers it. would seem necessary that any stoppage of supplies should.

should he nade at the source.   Compliance with the Japaneserequest would in effect involve His majesty&apos;s Government indeparture from neutrality and would amount to discrimination against China.     In strict neutrality a request to cut off the materials in question from China should involve a similarstoppage of supplies to Japan., hut this of course is in no waythe intention of His majesty&apos;s Government.In connexion with the Japanese Governments request thatthe Burma route should he closed to traffic to China, It is notirrelevant to recall that His La.jesty&apos;s Government have lately been endeavouring to secure the Japanese Government&apos;s assent tothe stoppage of certain materials to Germany with whom the UnitedKingdom are explicitly at war.     while the Japanese Government have -indicated their willingnesss under certain conditions, to arrangenot to re-export to Germany goods which they have purchased fromthe British Empire, they have declined to give any assurances inrespect of other Japanese imports, and have been unwilling even todiscuss the Imitation of exports via Siberia of goods produced in japan and Kanchukuo.   In the meantime the trade with Germanycontinues.His Majesty&apos;s Government declare once again that they have no desire to see hostilities between China and Japan prolonged, andhave already explained why they are unable to share the view of theJapanese Government that the closing of the Burma Road is essentialto the termination of these hostilities.   On the contrary, HisMajesty&apos;s Government have deplored them from the outset and have on various occasions expressed their readiness, should both parties sodesire, to use their endeavours to bring these hostilities to a close.   This attitude has in no way changed, and His majesty&apos;sGovernment venture to express the view that only by a just and equitable peace acceptable to both parties will the presentunfortunate dispute be terminated and thus pave the way to a generaland constructive settlement which will bring lasting peace and prosperity to the Par East.     His majesty1s Government for their part are ready and willing to afford their co-operation to achieve this end.Draft/

Draft, telegram to Sir R. Craigie.Your telegrams Nos. 111.-9 and 1150.After full and careful consideration of your views v/e have come to the conclusion that we must maintain the general linecontained in my telegram No. 635.   Passages on Hong Kong and burma have however been somewhat redrafted in accordance with your views.     For final version see my immediately following telegram.2.   You will see that the last paragraph has been considerablychanged since I should prefer you to use the material containedin the final paragraph as originally drafted as a separatecommunication either oral or written as you think best.   you should say that the fact that we cannot to our regret meet theJapanese Government on the question of the Burma Road does not mean that we are not willing to meet them on other questionswhich in our view are far more vital to their welfare.     It musthave been apparent to the Japanese, Government that, during thecourse of recent discussions between His majesty&apos;s Government andthe Japanese Government on economic questions, there has beenevident on the part of His majesty&apos;s Government a desire tounderstand japan s economic needs and to make, as far as possible,,provision for them.   His majesty1s Government are both willing andanxious to assure to Japan supplies of raw materials which Japanneeds and which the British Empire can supply, and they would urge that the pace of the negotiations already in progress shouldbe accelerated in order that our trade relations may be placed onla more satisfactory footing.3.   I am anxious to consider as soon as possible whatconstructive approach, if any. can be made to the Japanese Governmenton the lines of paragraph 5 of your telegram Ho. 1068.   As tothis a further telegram will follow.
