ANNEX I.Copy as handed to Mr. MacDonald, to &quot;be takenby him to Dublin on 26th June, 1940.The United Kingdom Government would be glad tobe informed what would be the attitude of the Governmentof Eire towards the following plan.      If the plan is acceptable as a whole to the Government of Eire, theUnited Kingdom Government will at once seek to obtainthe assent thereto of the Government of Northern Ireland,in so far as the plan affects Northern Ireland.The following are the proposals which, taken together as a whole, constitute the plan referred to inthe preceding, paragraph.(i) A declaration to be issued by the UnitedKingdom Government forthwith accepting theprinciple of a United Ireland,,(ii) A joint body including representatives of theGovernment of Eire and the Government ofNorthern Ireland to be set up at once towork out the constitutional and otherpractical details of the Union of Ireland.The United Kingdom Government to give suchassistant   towards the work of this bodyas might be desired.(iii) A joint Defence Council representative of eire and Northern Ireland to be set upimmediately.(iv) Eire to enter the war on the side of theUnited Kingdom end her allies forthwith, and,for the purposes of the Defence of Eire, theGovernment of Eire to invite British naval vessels to have the use of ports in Eireand British troops and aeroplanes toco-operate with the Eire forces and to be stationed in such positions in Eire as maybe agreed between the two Governments.(v) The Government of Eire to intern all Germanand Italian aliens in the country and to take any further steps necessary to suppress fifth column activities.(vi) The United Kingdom Government to providemilitary equipment at once to the Governmentof Eire ir. accordance with the particularsgiven in the annex.

ANNEX IIoFrom the United Kingdom Representative to Eire.Date 27th June,  1940 - Received 12.2 aem. , 28th June.IMMEDIATE.No.&apos; 65 SECRET.Following from Mr. MacDonald begins.     Mr. De Valeradiscussed plan with his colleagues this morning, and Ihad conversation with him,, Lemass and Aiken this afternoon.     This was most unsatisfactoryo     Aikenwho did most of the talking on their side, was even morepersistent than De Valera himself has been in urging that the proper solution is United Ireland which isneutral.     I again stated that this is entirely out ofthe question, and repeated reasons for this extent     Lemassseemed to be prepared to discuss our plan in a more reasonable way, but his contributions to discussion were usually cut short by fresh uncompromisinginterventions from one or other of his colleagues.      I gotimpression that De Valera had not passed on to hiscolleagues the assurance I gave him yesterday that declaration of a United Ireland should settle the issueonce and for all, and that there would be no going backon that, for he said that one of the principal reasons why his Cabinet regard the plan as unacceptable is thatthey believe that United Ireland will not materialise from it.     I repeated my assurances categorically to all three ministers and told them that if they rejected plan onthis ground it was a false point.     I think Lemass, andeven Aiken, was impressed.      I think it would strengthen our position if we amended the document by insertion of words which would give specific assurance on this point.Lemass, but not others, also seemed a bit influenced when said that we would be sufficiently content if Eire didnot positively enter war, but remained neutral and  -invited our ships into her ports and our troops and aero-planes into her territory as additional defence againstviolation of that neutrality.      I am definitely ofopinion that the Cabinet here will reject our plan.     Butin my opinion it would be wise to make amendment suggested above and also certain other amendments in the documentso as to bring out more clearly the specific advantages to people of Eire inherent in plan, and avoid possibilityof Eire Government rejecting it on grounds whichmisrepresent its real substance.      I propose to fly toLondon tomorrow morning and hope that I can discussamendments with Lord President and you in early afternoon,so that they could be telegraphed in final form to Maffeytomorrow evening at latest0     I told De Valera and hiscolleagues that I would probably send these amendments tothem tomorrow, and he has promised that document asamended will then be finally considered by Cabinet, andthat they will let us have written reply during week end.I feel that their attitude would be different if theyhad not an impression that we are going to lose the war,and that it would be a mi pj***Ve for them now to throw intheir lot with us.     Ends.

ANNEX III.TEXT OP COMMUNICATION HANDED TO MR., DE VALERAON .SATURDAYn  39 TH JUNE, 1940,Mi1. MacDonald has reported to me upon his conversations with you, and upon the reasons why you and your colleagues are not disposed to give an affirmativeanswer to the plan outlined in the document which he handed to you.      It seems that you feel that the plan as set forthdoes not give any firm assurance that, as a part of it, theUnion of Ireland would definitely become an establishedfact.      I would remind you that the whole plan depends upon our obtaining the assent of Northern Ireland, and it seemsto me that if this is done there can be no reason to doubtthat the plan will be carried out in its entirety.      i cannot, of course, give a guarantee that Northern Irelandwill assent, but if the plan is accepted by Eire we should do our best to persuade Northern Ireland to accept it alsoin the interests of the security of the whole Island.Nevertheless we should be willing to amend sub^paragraphs(i) and (ii) to read as follows:-(i) A declaration to be made by the United KingdomGovernment forthwith accepting the principleof a United Ireland.      This declaration wouldtake the : orm of a solemn undertaking that theUnion is to become at an early date anaccomplished fact from which there shall be noturning back.(ii) A joint Body., including representatives of theGovernment of Eire and the Government ofNorthern Ireland, to be set up at once to workout the Constitutional and other practicaldetails of the Union of Ireland.      The UnitedKingdom Government to give such assistance towards the work of this Body as might be desired, the purpose of the work being toestablish at as early a date as possible thewhole machinery of government of the Union.I understand from Mr,, MacDonald that you said thatin any case you did not think that the establishment of aJoint Defence Council by itself in the first instance wouldbe sufficient to demonstrate t--  your people the genuinenessof the change towards the Union of Ireland.     You suggestedthat it would be desirable that the parliaments of Eire andof Ulster should meet, together forthwith, with sovereignpowers to legislate for the whole of Ireland on matters ofcommon concern, pending the working out and more permanentestablishment of the Constitution of the Union.      I can assure you that if you wish to make a formal suggestion ofthat sort, as a part of the general plan, we should gladlygive it immediate consideration with every desire to reach an arrangement satisfactory to all the parties concerned.I understand that you demur to the suggestion thatthe Government of Eire should enter the war on the side ofthe United Kingdom and her Allies forthwith.      On this I do

not think it would he necessary for our purpose that Eireshould issue a declaration of war. provided that we weregiven the facilities we think necessary to guard, inconjunction with your own forces, against a sudden attack.vie should therefore be willing to amend sub-paragraph (iv)to read as follows.(iv) The Government of Sire to invite British naval vessels to have the use of ports in Eire, andBritish troops and aeroplanes to co-operate with the Eire Forces and to be stationed insuch positions in Eire as may be agreed betweenthe two Governments, for the purpose ofincreasing the security of Sire against the fate which has overcome neutral Norway,Holland, Belgium, Denmark and Luxembourg.The other sub-paragraphs would remain as they are.Mr. MacDonald has further reported that your ownsuggestion is that the Union of Ireland should beestablished oh the basis of the whole country becomingneutral.     Jjk5r the reasons given by Mr. MacDonald, thisproposal is unacceptable to us.I should be glad, therefore, if you and your colleagues would consider1 this letter in conjunction withthe document which Mr. MacDonald handed to you, so thatthere may be no misunderstanding of the scope and intention of the plan on which we invited your Government&apos;views.
