THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT176MOST SECRET. Copy No. 18July 8, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.ESTIMATED SCALE OF AIR ATTACK UPONUNITED KINGDOM.THE scale of the maximum bombing effort that the enemy could make hasbeen further discussed with the Director of Air Intelligence and members ofhis staff.The following conclusions emerged : 1. In arriving at a bomb-load of 4,800 tons it had been assumed that this figure was related to the initial day, and that 80 per cent, of the established bomber force would be available. This might be so after a further short period of recuperation. To-day 50 per cent, would benearer the mark.2. It was assumed that the enemy bombers would average 1^ attacks a day during the first week. This pre-supposed concentration of squadrons in Flanders and of effort on South-East England. The presentdistribution from Trondheim to Brest did not agree with this. Henceone attack a day as an average for the whole force would be the mostto be expected over the period of the first week.Taking account of the delay apparent recently in bringing German squadronsup to estaolishment, it was thought that at the present Sate an average of1,800 tons a day was likely to be the maximum we need anticipate for the first week diminishing rapidly thereafter.July 8, 1940.[21502]

Our report is contained in the ensuing paragraphs.3. German forces at present available to undertake an attack on the british isles are given in Appendix A. It is clear that as regards land forces germany could attempt an invasion of this country at the same time as the renewedoffensive on France now taking place. As far as air forces are concerned,however, such an attack would call for the use of the maximum air forcespossible; the attack on France will absorb an appreciable proportion of such forces. Moreover, German strategy has hitherto concentrated on one aim at atime, and, therefore, taking the past as a guide, it is probable that Germany willnot attempt an attack on the British Isles coincident with the renewed attackon the French. In the summary which follows, German strengths have beenconsidered to be those which exist to-day. The position as it may be at theconclusion of the attack on France has not been considered.4. The invasion of this country will be for Germany her culminating effort of the war. She may be expected, therefore, to press it with the utmost intensityregardless of loss, and to throw into the balance all her available resources.5. The forms of attack to which the British Isles may be subjected are considered to be as follows: (a) a preliminary air offensive;(6) preliminary naval operations;(c) an air-borne expedition;(a) a sea-borne invasion.* CCS. (40) 165th Meeting, Minute 4.[21506] b
These forms of attack, together with the scales of attack considered likely ineach case, are considered in the ensuing paragraphs.. . (a) and (b) are likely to be simultaneous and (c) to follow soon after. If (a)is successful: (c) and (d) could be directed either against Great Britain, or against Eire as a preliminary to further operations against Great Britain. these aspects are therefore considered, separately.6. German strategy aims at mystifying and misleading the enemy to themaximum extent. Hence all the above forms of attack are likely to be accompaniedby diversions and feints in order to confuse our forces, and to cause us to commit ourselves and our reserves in false directions. With regard to diversions itmust be borne in mind, however, that, should the Germans succeed in effectinga good foothold in any minor operation, they would not hesitate to reinforcesuccess, and would seek to exploit it by switching their reserves to the areas where they had been successful, but this would not be possible in the case of (d).Preliminary Air Offensive.7. An initial air offensive combined with sabotage, and Fifth ColumnActivities would most probably aim at achieving the greatest possible degree ofneutralisation of our fighter and bomber forces. A systematic attack must beexpected on our defence organisation including aerodromes, storage and mainten-ance depots, and the aircraft industry. Attack is also likely on Government andmilitary centres and centres of communication and transportation. The offensivewould be combined with or followed by air operations against our fleet, and ports on our South and West coasts from France, and against ports on our East and scottish coasts from the Low Countries, Germany, Denmark and Norway.Germany is likely to use all her available bomber forces for this purpose withthe object of annihilating the R.A.F., reducing our naval forces, and causing themost complete disorganisation in the country generally.A maximum total ofa4^DiLions of bombs per day must initially be expected.(See also Appendix A, paragraphs 6 to 8.)Preliminary Naval Operations.8. The German naval object will be to secure their lines of communicationsfor 24 hours. With this end in view they will probably carry out the followingoperations :  .(a) Attempt to mine our naval forces in their bases.(6) Attempt a diversion by the operations of submarines or heavy ships todraw our naval forces away from the invasion route.Air-Borne Expedition.9.   Experience shows that likely objectives are :    i;(a) Landing grounds and coast defences especially those adjacent to portsor suitable beaches.(b) Centres of Government and transportation and communication centres.(c) Arsenals and munition factories.(d) It is also possible that air-borne troops might attempt to release andarm prisoners of war.It is considered that the bulk of the air-borne troops would form the advanceguard of the main sea-borne expedition. Some of them, however, would certainly be landed elsewhere over wide areas to co-operate with the Fifth Column, andto cause confusion and dispersion of effort in the manner indicated below :  (e) Incendiarism and the destruction of public utility enterprises.(/) Destruction of the principal means of communication.(g) Cutting and tapping of telephone wires.(h) Firing on troops, supply-columns and refugees to create confusion andpanic.(i) Indication of bombing targets by prearranged signal, e.g., ground strips,lamps, clearing areas of long grass or crops in special shapes, suchas rings or crosses.(;&apos;) Spreading of false news.
Great Britain.10. The initial invasion is likely to be made from the air. Landing grounds and any open spaces will be used for the landing of substantial numbers oftroops, and the Germans have sufficient aircraft to transport some 9,750 lightly-equipped men in one flight. (See also Appendix A, paragraphs 10 to 12.) Thenumber of flights per day would vary between one-and-a-half for East Angliato three for Kent, provided that there was no air opposition. In view of probableground opposition and the consequent need for some heavy equipment, suchas infantry guns, mortars, machine guns, ammunition reserves, motor-cycle com-binations and bicycles, and possibly a few light tanks, it is unlikely that thenumbers landed in the first day would be more than 10,000 for East Anglia or20,000 for Kent.Such forces could only be landed after a large measure of air superiorityhad been obtained, and the figures take no account of losses from A.A. fire,crashes and destruction by ground action on landing.Troops may also be landed from gliders near the Kent coast, but we donot consider that this will be carried out on any large scale.11. Germany has also some 100 sea planes with a total carrying capacityof 800 to 1,000; these may be used for landings on enclosed waters such as the humber, Norfolk Broads, large reservoirs, &amp;c.Ireland.12. Ireland is particularly favourable for air landings in view of the I.R.A.organisation and known German activities. Germany might, therefore, attemptto establish herself in Ireland with the object of attacking our Western ports,and shipping in the Western approaches. It is not considered that such attackswould be carried out in any force as the Eire Government could put up littleresistance, and supplies for large air and air defence forces would have to bebrought in by sea. Furthermore, the numbers of troop-carrying aircraft availablefor Ireland are likely to be limited by the German need to reserve the mainportion of their air transport fleet for the main blow the invasion of GreatBritain.There is evidence that Germany is deliberately stressing the threat to Irelandwith the object of encouraging a dispersion of our forces.Seaborne Expedition.Great Britain.13. Any extensive airborne expedition must be followed up immediately by a seaborne expedition owing to the difficulty of supply by air over a lengthyperiod. It will be seen from Appendix A that the provision of the necessaryland troops for invasion presents no problem to Germany.14. In order to achieve the greatest measure of surprise it is likely thatGermany will embark the main expedition from German ports and send it bythe shortest sea routes.15. It is probable that the Germans will employ their maximum scale of effort, and will be prepared to accept almost catastrophic losses. Wide dispersionof the points of attack is likely, and simultaneous attacks on numerous points isprobable. At each point of attack the best possible use will be made of air forces,armoured fighting vehicles and fifth column. These forces will rely on localsupplies of every description, including petrol. They will not hamper themselves with a mass of administrative echelons.16.   Seaborne invasion may be delivered by (a) Ordinary transports of various types, relying on port facilities forunloading.-(b) Transports of a special type, self-contained as regards unloading.(c) Special landing craft.(d) Fast motorboats.(e) Naval surf ace ships.(/) U-boats.[21506] b 2
,17. The enemy may be expected to assemble his expedition in the shortest possible time before it is launched, and he may attempt to evade our reconnaissance-by assembling at numerous points, large transports coming from a distance, while;smaller craft will be collecting in the numerous canals and estuaries closer to ourcoasts... ......18. Owing to the necessity for centralising the air and seaborne efforts, andthe comparative inability of fighter aircraft to intercept at night, it is probablethat attack will be made on a dark night or at early dawn, but it seems certainthat the initial landing will be made at high tide..19. The most favourable area for seaborne invasion would be that which provides the optimum conditions for landing. This is the zone in which Germanfighters and bombers, including short-range bombers, can co-operate fully, and itstretches at present from the Wash to Newhaven. It will extend to the westwardaccording to the progress of a German advance in Northern France.20. If, however, Germany decides to send an initial expedition of five divisions, requiring some 200 to 250 ships (see paragraph 25) it would be difficult for her to restrict operations to this area. Armoured fighting vehicles can be landed by ordinary transports or warships only at an established port; transportsof a special type or special landing craft can, however, be used on an open beachin fine weather from the Wash to Newhaven. There are other objectives and portsavailable to the northward of this area which may be selected, but this wouldinvolve a longer sea voyage, and will lie outside the area of the maximum german air effort.   .   -21. The Germans may employ the following tactical methods to support aseaborne expedition (a) Interception of our forces by a suitable disposition of U-boats.(&amp;&apos;) Close escort, light cruisers and/or destroyers and M.T.Bs.(c) Support by cruisers and/or heavy ships.(d) Cover by cruisers or heavy ships and U-boats.(e) Cover by a strong escort of bombers and fighters.22. Any attempt to forecast the exact location of German landings wouldbe fruitless, since it is anticipated that they will accept risks from their ownmines, and navigational difficulties are not insuperable on any part of the coast,especially if special landing craft are used.23. From the military and air point of view, however, the main Germanobjectives are likely to be the Kent and Sussex coasts, and the east coast south ofthe Wa.sh; here covering positions could be secured with the possible object ofsubsequently cutting off London from the west. Any landings on the Sussex coastmust, however, involve forcing the Straits of Dover.24. . The enemy may employ his heavy surface forces as a diversion or ascoyer..to,his main expedition. This diversion to be effective must be to the north-ward; of our fleet bases, and threaten some interest valuable to us, such as theNorthern patrol, our forces at Narvik, the ocean trade routes, Iceland, the Faroesand Eire.His battle cruisers are likely units to be used in the northern diversionwhich, in view of the present situation, Narvik and of the northern patrol must be countered.   He also has adequate strength to operate as many as two 8-inch- cruisers, three 6-inch cruisers and possibly two old battleships in the southern part of the.North Sea.   It is therefore necessary for us to provide a sufficient, force of heavy ships, together with a reconnaissance and screening force to counter; both these possibilities.25. Whilst we retain naval superiority, Germany cannot guarantee thesecurity of her communications with the landing points for more than24 hours. The first wave of invasion must therefore make the attempt at landing;. within this/period. A force of 5 divisions would require 200 to 250 ships. It ispossible to conceive this as a first wave should the German Military Commanddecide to rush the ships in at such places as. the Humber and the Thames Estuary,as well as grounding transports on suitable beaches and accepting losses. -    -
26. Altogether, Germany has a large number of divisions available forinvasion, but she will be unable to move these across the North Sea after the firstwave until, through naval and air action, she has succeeded in reducing our. fleet to impotence. Intensive sea and air attack on our fleet is therefore: likely1 to heundertaken in order to secure her lines of communications, and to enable her tomaintain and send reinforcements to the troops already landed.Ireland.27. Reports have been received of projected sea-borne landings in Irelandfrom Spain, but there is no evidence that these have been planned, and at presentthese reports are considered open to doubt. It seems possible, however, that we may expect a feint against Ireland in order to draw our fleet away from the mainsea-borne expedition.Conclusions.28. A German invasion of the British Isles is likely to be preceded, oraccompanied by feints and diversions in order to confuse us and to, cause, us to commit our forces in false directions.Great Britain. , .29. An attempted German invasion of Great Britain is likely to be preceded by an air offensive directed against our whole air defence organisation and theaircraft industry; also on important civil and military centres, and the fleet and ports. The initial scale of attack may be as much as 4,800 tons of bombs a day,diminishing in accordance with the effectiveness of the opposition encountered,and the unserviceability of the aircraft employed.30. Intensive mining will be carried out as a preliminary operation, andwill be aimed at immobilising our naval forces in their harbours, and protecting the selected landing areas. Efforts will also be made to divert our naval forces from the vital areas and to intercept and destroy by submarines, air attack andmines, our naval forces proceeding to these areas.31. In view of probable British ground opposition, German air-borne troopsmust be adequately armed and equipped. It is unlikely, therefore, that thenumbers of such troops&apos;that can be landed on the first day will be greater than10,000 in the case of an attack on East Angli fi, or 20, 000 in the case of an attackon Kent. In addition landings by sea-planes on enclosed waters must be expected.Such forces could only be landed after a large measure of air superiority hadbeen obtained, and the figures take no account of losses en route or after landing.32. Germany has available at least 5,000 trained parachute troops and isknown to be training more. She may also employ an unknown number of semi-trained parachute troops. In addition the use of Gliders on the South-east coast is possible.33. The sea-borne invasion may take place anywhere between the Wash andNewhaven, and land forces will not be the limiting factor. If, however, Germanyintends to attempt an invasion, using a first wave of as many as 5 divisions, in200 to 250 ships, it is probable that she will not confine herself to this area, but will try to force transports into the Humber and the Tyne. If the first waveis landed successfully Germany will endeavour by sea and air action to neutraliseour Fleet in order to secure her communications with the first wave, and toenable her to maintain and reinforce the troops already landed.;  ,. . t ;    . Ireland. , v - &apos; .\ w34,   Air landings in Ireland are probable as a diversion.   They are not likely to be on any large scale, owing to the difficulty of maintenance, the &amp;smallness of effective opposition, and the need for Germany to reserve her mainair transport fleet for the invasion of Great Britain.
APPENDIX A.German Forces available for an A attack on the British Isles.Army.1. GERMANY has available for the present offensive against France some75 to 80 divisions of all natures, without counting the divisions opposite theMaginot Line and Upper Rhine zone, and without depleting her troops in theEast and South-East.In addition to this there are some 30 to 40 divisions in Central germany of which 25 to 35 are now forming.To oppose the troops in France the Allies have at present only some 49divisions, and of these the armoured and mechanized divisions are very reduced.2. We consider that as long as France resists, Germany will keep superiorforces in France. It is estimated, however, that, whether Germany attacks thiscountry now or later, she will be able to make available for such an attackany numbers of divisions she may require. The initial numbers are likely to be restricted to those highly trained, and some of them will have been trained in opposed landings in which Germany now has considerable experience. a proportion of A.F.Vs. will be landed early from special craft, followed byarmoured and motorised divisions as soon as adequate landing facilities areavailable.Navy.3.   The present strength of the German Fleet is as follows : Battle Cruisers : Scharnhorst, Gneisenau.Battleships : Modern, nil; old, two.Armoured Ships : One may be repaired by August.*Aircraft Carriers : Graf Zeppelin.8-inch Cruisers : Prinz Eugen, Hipper.6-inch Cruisers : Nurnberg, Leipsig, Koln and Emden.Destroyers ; 9-12.Torpedo Boats : 24.Escort Vessels : 8.U-boats: 50-60.M.T.B.&apos;s: 40-50.4. Shipping will not be a limiting factor in conveying an expeditionaryforce. :Air Force.5. The Germans will employ aerodromes in Holland, Belgium andNorthern France to their maximum capacity. These aerodromes would be used by dive bombers and fighters. Long-range bombers may use them to a lesser extent for refuelling and rearming, but will operate chiefly from base aerodromesnear the frontier.   At a later date, when aerodromes have been made completely* And one other subsequently.35. Sea-borne expedition against Ireland seems unlikely, but feints andfalse rumours are to be anticipated.V. CAVENDISH-BENTINCK.F. G. BEAUMONT-NESBITT.ROGER BELLAIRS (for D.N.I.).A. R. BOYLE.Richmond Terrace, S.V/. 1,June 6, 1940.
serviceable and new ones prepared, long-range bombers may also use advanceaerodromes, returning to German bases occasionally for refits and rest periods.6. If Germany were to launch an attack having first had a short period inwhich to obtain a maximum state of serviceability, then it is considered thatshe would have the following air forces available : Bombers.7. 80 per cent, of the German bomber force would be available, i.e., 1,600long-range bombers and 400 dive bombers. The scales of attack would be asfollows : Type.	Number.	Bomb-load.	Total.He. Ill   Long-range Ju. 88 Do. 17 Ju. 87      Short-range	1,100 300 200 400	2 tons 2 tons 1 ton I ton	2,200 600 200 200			3,200 tons 8. Sorties should be expected at the rate if \\ per day, provided that units have had a period of rest, and reserve crews are in readiness. These rates ofsorties might be maintained for the first week (though with diminishing numericalforce) depending on the effectiveness of the opposition encountered.Fighter Escorts.9. While our fighter defence remains effective the Germans are almost certain to employ fighters as escorts. The number that could be employed would depend on our offensive measures, and the resultant need of Germany to retainfighters for defence. It is estimated that about one-third, i.e., 500, of the Germanfighter forces would be available for escort purposes, approximately 300 Me. 110and 200 Me. 109 This number would not appear to be large enough to providethe numerical degree of protection already experienced in the battle area; onthe other hand fighters could carry out more sorties than bombers, their bases beingfurther West resulting in a higher numerical degree of protection than thefigure of 500 would apparently indicate.Troop-carrying A aircraft.10. The number of 1 troop-carrying aircraft.which might be used for an air-borne invasion of the British Isles is estimated as follows : Number.	Type.	Normal capacity.	Total.	Remarks.(a)   500 100 50	Ju. 52...... Ju. 86      ...... 4-engined aircraft Ju. 52      ......	15 10 25 15	7,500 1,000 1,250	Immediately available. Immediately available. Immediately available.650 (b)   700			9,750 10,500	Not immediately available but now in schools and as transport aircraft in first-line squadrons.Grand total    1,350			20,250	11. The alternative figures of 9,750 and 20,250 represent the numbers whichcould be carried by one sortie. If, however, the 700 Ju. 52 aircraft included under (b) above were made use of, the German training organisation for pilots
would largely suffer; further, first-line squadrons would be bereft of their supplyaircraft and would generally be less effective.In addition to troop-carrying aircraft, Germany has 100 seaplanes capableof parrying troops, with a total capacity of 800 to 1,000.Parachute Troops.12. The Germans are estimated to have at least 5,000 trained parachutistsnow available. In addition, an unknown number of untrained personnel arelikely to be employed as parachutists, and it is known that a drive to increase thenumber of parachutists is in progress.13.   Germany has a large number of personnel trained in gliding.
