Moreover, the acceleration of the production programme and theincrease in the number of aircraft turned out by the repair organisation demand that the output of pilots and air crews should be increased to correspond.Clearly energetic action is required, and the whole training organisation hasbeen overhauled with a view to seeing how bottle-necks can be dealt with and[21484]\
output increased. A number of measures have already been adopted in recent weeks to speed up the work in the schools with the result that :--I. All courses at elementary flying training schools have been reduced from weeks to 7.2. Both the intermediate and advanced courses at all flying training schools(except two which specialise in Naval training and one other school where specialcircumstances obtain), have been reduced by one week.3. Specialisation has been introduced at an earlier stage. Two schoolshave already been turned over to the specialised training of fighter pilots and both the intermediate and advanced courses at these schools have been reducedby a further week. Two further schools are being turned over to fighter specialisations-tion using Hart Variants to be replaced by Harvard or Master aircraft as soonas they become available.4. The intake of the elementary schools has been increased by 25 per cent,as a safeguard against wastage during the early stages of training.The effect of these four steps will be to increase the output at 12 schools forthe period June to September inclusive from 1,632 to 2,108 pilots.5. The courses at fighter operational training units have been reduced froma month to two weeks, and the capacity has been increased from an intake of 39a fortnight to 90, while the capacity of the operational training units as a whole will be increased from a fortnightly entry of 263 to 416. Advantage has also beentaken of the temporary lull in fighter operations to post 54 pilots direct from service flying training schools to fighter squadrons to enable them to carry out their advanced training there.6. Arrangements have been made with the Admiralty for the loan to theR.A.F. of 67 pilots from the flying training schools which train for the fleet air Arm. The Admiralty have also agreed to consider allocating a quota fromfuture courses.7. Steps have also &quot;been taken to review the establishments at the AirMinistry and at Commands with a view to ensuring that pilots who would be suitable either for operational duties or as flying instructors are relieved wherever possible from staff, administrative and technical appointments. Similarly, allpilots who would be suitable either for operational duties or as flying instructorsare being combed from non-operational flying units and replaced by non-operational pilots or, for ferry work, by women.8. Arrangements were made some time ago to embody some 300 pilots ofthe Polish air force. The first Polish bomber squadron formed to-day : a secondwill form shortly; and the first batch of 70 Polish pilots selected for fighter dutiesare now undergoing special training. There is the prospect of a very largenumber more to come from Poles who have crossed from France. arrangements are also in hand for the entry and training of Belgian, Dutch, Czech and Frenchpilots.9. Arrangements have been made to bring to this country and to enterinto the R.A.F. British subjects resident in the United States and Canada and united States citizens who are suitably experienced pilots. In order to facilitate the entry of these latter the oath of allegiance is being dispensed with. It ishoped to obtain pilots with considerable flying experience who will, in manycases, be able to proceed direct to the operational training units, while others who are over-age for operational duties, will be able to relieve young pilotsemployed in non-operational units.10. Steps similar to those outlined above have been taken to speed up thetraining of observers and wireless operator air gunners, and to enter and trainobservers and wireless operators from allied air forces and from abroad.II. A special post of Air Member for Training has been created on the air council, and this officer will have the dual responsibility, first, of formulatingand implementing R.A.F. training policy, and, secondly, of ensuring that thetraining organisation is adequate to meet the requirements of the Service.
So much for the steps taken already to deal with the immediate situation.It is also necessary to review our long-term policy and to reach early decisions which will take account &quot;! (1) of recent changes in the operational situation, which have increased the vulnerability of the areas in which our schools are placed,(2) of the increased output of aircraft that we can expect from this country as a result of the speeding up of the production programme, and(3) of the larger deliveries to be anticipated from the United States, whichwill now include the French share.The increases in aircraft deliveries which we may expect make it essentialthat steps should be taken immediately to expand the training organisation. Buttraining in this country will become increasingly difficult and flying spaceincreasingly congested owing to operational requirements and to enemy action.Several aerodromes previously used for training have already had to be surrendered for operational purposes. Others will be taken in the near futureor will be rendered unsuitable for training purposes. We have lost the aero-dromes which were under preparation for five Service training schools in theVendome area in France, and we have had to give up our plans for establishing a similar number of schools in French North Africa. It is clear, therefore, that full use must be made of aerodromes in the Dominions and the Colonies (and ifpossible also in the United States) which are free from the risk of operationalinterference and where, as a result of the better weather conditions, a larger number of flying hours can be put in.During the critical stages of the fighting in Flanders it was decided to stopshipments of aircraft for the Empire Air Training Scheme. Not only wouldthese aircraft have been useful in the last resort for operations against the enemy,but the Merlin engine is used in the Hurricane, Spitfire and Defiant as well asin the Battle, and these engines in consequence constituted a valuable reserve.As a result of the stopping of shipments, the Empire Training Scheme hasalready been put back by a period which is estimated at 8 weeks. Thus thefuture output of pilots will be reduced at a time when personnel requirements will have greatly increased.We are entering on a new phase of the war when it will be necessary to plan for a longer period ahead, even if some measure of risk is involved in the intervening period, and I consider that it is essential to resume the shipment of aircraft forthwith, and to take every step that is in our power to speed up thearrangements already made for training overseas. Even so, further expansionof training will be necessary, and to the extent that schools are not available inthis country we must find additional sites abroad to which home schools can be moved or where new schools can be established.I am considering with the newly appointed Air Member for Training thefurther steps that will be necessary if we are to have pilots and crews in thenumbers that will be required if we are to take advantage of the large increasein production which the Minister of Aircraft Production promises for next spring and summer. Requirements in instructors wall certainly be large. We arecombing Air Force establishments, but it may be found that it will only be possibleto expand training by drawing crews out of the line to act as instructors. Such adecision would clearly be a serious one, but the Royal Air Force system of organisation is sufficiently flexible to enable us, if the position becomes critical,to make full use of the aircraft and experienced crews of our operational training units and even to use parts of our training organisation in actual operations against the enemy.   Plans to this end have already been made.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, July 1, 1940.
