The means at our disposal for obtaining information canbe grouped under four main heads:-(i) Naval reconnaissance, including reports from both surface and submarine patrols.(ii) Air Reconnaissance, of which the primarysources are the patrols from the coastal command. Supplementary to these are thephotographic reconnaissances of the PhotographicDevelopment Unit, which has recently been placed under the direct control of the Air OfficerCommanding-in-chief, Coastal Commandj    the reports from the aircraft of Bomber Command, which arerequired to report all activities at ports,movements of. ships, concentrations on aerodromes,and activities on railways and inland waterwaysseen in the course of their raids; and reports from fighter petrols over enemy occupied territory.&apos;W.M.

(b)(iii) Reports iron?, secret intelligence sources.(iv) Reports from enemy wireless intercepts,,.The method of collating and disseminating information whenreceived and the authority responsible for deciding: uponthe scale-and scope cf further:reconnaissance,LInformation received from all sources is collected andcollated by a Combined Intelligence Committee, which._h.as beenestablished for this specific duty.    It consists of intelligenceStaff Officers from the three Services, and has been functioningifor some weeks under the following terns of reference:&quot;(i) To consider all intelligence matters appertainingto invasion, whether embodied in intelligencesummaries already, or otherwise brought to notice.(ii)  To correlate the Naval, Military and Air Forceaspects of such information.(iii) To formulate and submit to higher authority,including Home Defence, daily, and whenevernecessary, appreciations of the general situationor any particular aspect thereof,(iv) To advise on air reconnaissances required,stating the order of priority&quot;.4. The Combined Intelligence Committee is not required tobe in permanent session but at least one member from each service is employed full-time on the Committee&apos;s work.5. The Committee has a regular daily meeting at which each member produces any intelligence concerning invasion, togetherwith the comments of his own intelligence division.    Informationjis collated and a daily report produced.    Additional meetingsare held, however, to consider fresh information as it is received, and an Interim Report is made.6. Reports are circulated In the Admiralty,  War Office,and Air Ministry and copies are sent to Home Forces, theForeign Office and the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee.7. The Air Force  member of the Committee receivesimmediaofc-i./ all reports of air reconnaissance and transmission of these reports to the Air Ministry is being accelerated tothe greatest possible extent.8. The list of immediate requirements for further airreconnaissances in order of priority is forwa.rded_.toHeadquarters, Coastal Command..    In order that no time shouldbe lost, however,  Coastal Command is also given the require-men ts by telephone as soon as the list has been prepared.

(c)   The machinery for taking action on reports of enemy concentrations of &quot;troops, ships or aircraftindicating invasion was imminent, so that if possiblethese concentrations could be forthwith attacked*9, We have carefully examined the machinery availablein the Admiralty and Air Ministry for the above purpose.We are satisfied that; in the Admiralty,  the Naval staff has all the necessary machinery for taking immediateexecutive actions     The Admiralty would deal with invasionin the same way as with any major operation..     The DutyCaptain is always available to j.-afoir. Directors of operations and higher authorities as requisite and tosee that immediate action is taken.10.       A similar organisation exists in the Air Ministry,but the Air Staff problem is made more complex for two reasons:-(i) The speed at which air forces operate over longranges.(ii) The fact that the Air Force Commands operate ona functional, rather than a geographical basis,and there is therefore a more continuous needfor control and co-ordination by the Air staff to ensure (^-ordination and prevent overlapping.11,       The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff is responsiblefor the day to day direction and control of the operations of the Metropolitan Air Forces on behalf of the Chief ofthe Air Staff, and for the necessary co-ordination betweenCommands.      Pie has however a large number of departmentalduties to perform in addition to his responsibilities forthe direction of operations, and is thus   unable to devotehis whole time to this part of his dutiese     It has&apos;-&apos;therefore been decided that a senior Staff Officer should .be appointed forthwith whose sole duty will be to assistthe Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in the day to day controlof air operations to counter invasion.     He will keep inclose and continuous touch with the operational planning and Intelligence branches of the Air Staff, and, in the. - -absence of the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, will beresponsible for advising the appropriate Director of anydevelopments in the situation requiring immediate consideration or action on the part of Commands.     TheOfficer has already been selected for this appointment and has taken up his duties.IS, .  With this appointment, we are satisfied thatthe machinery in both the Admiralty and Air Ministry is satisfactory and sufficient for the purpose.(Signed) DUDLEY POUND.R.E.C.PEIRSE&apos;v(c;;,s.R.H.HAININGV 0 C . 1 .
