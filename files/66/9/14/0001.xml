This Documefit is thoYTO BE KEPT UNOFn i *Mit is req   -WAR CABINET        ,,, ,POLICY IN THE FAR east memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.P(40)254. 1.   This paper does not attempt to do more thansuggest the line of &quot;immediate policy to be pursued inme 29th      relation to the recent Japanese demands.   It is obviously1940. desirable if we can to avoid trouble with Japan at this moment but it is also doubtful whether concessions fromweakness on points of principle, apart from other considera-tions, would bring any lasting improvement in Anglo-Japanese relations.   And in the attempt to find the way of accommodation with Japan we must, in my view, be careful not to destroy confidence in British policy m China andthe D.S.A.2.   On Italy1s entry into the war the JapaneseGovernment repeated a request made at the beginning ofthe European war for the withdrawal of British troops andwarships from Japanese occupied areas In China.    (A similarrequest was addressed to France and Italy, the otherbelligerents having forces in the Far East).   This request was subsequently reinforced by demands for(1) the prevention of the supply of war material tothe Chinese Government via Hong Kong and(2) the stoppage of the transport of military supplies to China via Burma, including arms, ammunition, fuel oil,gasoline, lorries and railway material.These demands were first communicated in rathermenacing fashion by the Director of Military Intelligenceof the Japanese General Staff to our Military Attache atTokyo, and were later confirmed in more diplomatic languageby the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to His Majesty&apos;ambassador.5.   In reply to an enquiry, the United StatesGovernment have indicated to us that they will give usdiplomatic but not armed support if we choose to retain our garrisons in China.   Lord Lothian considers that theUnited States are unlikely to use force in defence ofBritish or French interests in the Far East or indeed of anything west of Hawaii.   We must assume therefore thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government will, in the first place atleast, have to rely on their own resources without active support from the.United States.   After careful considera-tion of the views expressed by His Majesty1s Ambassadorsat Washington, Tokyo, and Shanghai, it is proposed that theJapanese demands should be dealt with as follows.4.   Burma Road.I take this, which is clearly the most serious of theJapanese demands, first.   Compliance with the Japanese re-quest would mean cutting off Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s last mainmeans of communication with the outside world, except for theSinkiang Road to Russia.   It would mean the cutting off of vital supplies, predominantly American, to China.The amount of material reaching the Chinese government by/

o2.21,965        &quot;by this route is not indeed very large;   though, withmetric tons   indo-China closed, the road will no doubt be employed toin 1959 the limit of capacity.   The political effect of our cuttingthis road would, however, be considerable.   It would betaken to mean that Great Britain had deserted Chiang Kai-shek and would deal a severe&apos; blow at the morale in Chungking.This is no doubt what Japan wants and the result mighteither be to throw Chiang Kai-shek entirely into the arms of Russia or to force him to come to terms with theJapanese for a peace that might be extremely disadvantageousto ourselves.The effect on the large body of opinion in Americawhich takes a somewhat sentimental interest in the far east would be definitely bad, and if at some later stageour difficulties in the Far Bast increased, the chance of inducing the United States at least to impose an embargo on war supplies would be by so much reduced.It might be argued that if by acceding to theJapanese demand on this point we could ensure that japan would stay out of the European war, the advantage to be gained would make it worth considering.   But I am afraid that no undertaking is likely to be forthcoming from japan in this sense.   His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokyoeven foresees that if we give way on this demand we shalllater be faced with further awkward demands.   He doesnot think that refusal will lead at this stage to anattack by force of arms on British interests, but more probably to some action such as a blockade of Hong Kong.Although Sir Robert Craigie is himself in favourof closing the Burma Road to war supplies, I think there is little doubt that we cannot, in fact, accede to this demand.5. Hong Kong.Direct access from Hong Kong to free China hasbeen cut off for the last eighteen months by theJapanese themselves.   It is not clear therefore what  .the Japanese have in mind.   Their demand may relate tothe entrepot trade or to the presence in Hong Kong ofcertain Chinese Government offices.      We might therefore on this point ask the Japanese what preciselyit is they wish us to do.

6.   China garrisons.,The most imnortant garrison is that of Shanghai,consisting of aboirfc two battalions, those at Peking andTientsin having been reduced at the beginning of the v/arto token forces.H.M. Ambassador at Shanghai has warned us thatwithdrawal would certainly be most unwelcome to the ChineseGovernment, since they regard the Shanghai Garrison at least as a symbol of our wish to resist Japanese aggression.     Herecognises, nonetheless, that the decision must be taken onwide military considerations and though withdrawal in his view would involve a certain loss of prestige, he does notclaim that the retention of these forces is essential andconsiders that concession on this point would be much lessdamaging than concession on the Burma Road.     On the whole Ishould be disposed to tell the Japanese that we were willingto remove these garrisons, provided the Italian forces arealso withdrawn from Shanghai and making plain that we expect theJapanese to protect British lives and property and respect thestatus of the International Settlement.     (The question of the single gun-boats at Shanghai and Canton required chiefly forwireless purposes should, if possible, be left for later consideration. )7.     If it is thought desirable to try to find somethingon which to meet the Japanese, the withdrawal of the garrisonsseems to provide the best means of doing so, although I wouldnot put the value of concession in this matter very high in comparison with what the Japanese principally desire as regardsthe Burma Road.     At the same time it is desirable to minimise the occasion of incidents as far as possible, and there seemto be substantial reasons which from our point of view tell infavour of withdrawal.(a) The United States have refused to give us armed support in the event of trouble.(b) These detachments are in no way able to resist any japanese attack.(c) They would presumably be useful at Singapore, and(d) if we had trouble with the Japanese and the detachmentswere captured, the resultant damage to our prestige would be greater than that involved in a withdrawal which can at this juncture be plausibly justified on military grounds.8.     To sum up, I should recommend(1) rejection of the demand to close the Burma Road,(.2) enquiry as to what is meant by the request concerningHong Kong,(5) conditional acceptance of the request for withdrawalof/

Foreign Office,HoJune 29th, 1940o,of the China garrisons.9,   I should like as soon as possible to seek means ofmaking some constructive offer to Japan which might provide sufficient inducement to deter her from an attack on our interests.     We have already approached the United StatesGovernment with a proposal that if they are unwilling togive us armed support in the Far East, they should take theinitiative towards a general settlement in the Far East, towhich we should be willing to make our contribution.     Sofar the indications are that the United States Governmentwill not be disposed to take an initiative of this kind, butthey are not unwilling to consider proposals in this sense ifwe put them forward.     We are not at this stage ready to makeconcrete proposals but I would suggest that, when conveyingour replies to the Japanese demands, the Ambassador shouldremind the Japanese Government that H.M.Government&apos;s good offices are always available to Japan for an equitablesettlement of the China incident, and associate with this statement a hint that we are prepared to examine means bywhich Japan can be assured of vital economic supplies.A draft telegram to Sir R.Craigie, embodying the lineof action described above, is attached hereto.

ANNEX.Draft telegram to   Sir  Re Craigie.Since the question of the withdrawal of our garrison from shanghai was made the occasion of separate and earlier representa-tions   I think that if you see no objection you should firstreply on this point.   You could then make a purely oral reply on the question of Hongkong, and then, finally, deal with thequestion of Burma,,-  It would, I think, be advisable to leave a written memorandum on the subject of both the withdrawalof troops and of Burma.2.   The following are the terms of the replies:,A.   Withdrawal of troops.. His Majesty&apos;s Government havetaken note of the request of the Japanese Government made on11th June, that British armed forces should be voluntarilywithdrawn from Shanghai, Peking and Tientsin In view of thefact that Great Britain and Italy are now at warBHis. liajesty&apos; s Government desire to state in reply thatwhile they.are sensible of the apprehensions of the JapaneseGovernment that an extension of hostilities might result from the presence of British and Italian armed forces at these ports, they are satisfied that the steps which havebeen taken to avert untoward incidents are in the circumstancesadequate, and that no situation should arise which would justify the anxiety of the Japanese Government.   NeverthelessHis Majesty&apos;s Government wish to inform the Japanese Govern-ment   that, for reasons connected Y/ith the general Yrorldsituation, they have already had under consideration thequestion   of withdrawing their land garrisons from Shanghai,Peking and Tientsin.     Subject to what is said below, and provided, of course, that the Italian garrisons at these places are. similarly withdrawn, His Majesty&apos;s   Governmentwould be prepared to effect this withdrawal at an early date,in order to release these troops for other duties.    Theywould observe that the presence of British troops in shanghai is part of an arrangement for general security which affects other Powers besides Great Britain, and theyare therefore concerned to know what effect the withdrawalof these troops would have in the international administrationof the settlement and of the British interests therein.His Majesty&apos;s Government assume   that the Japanese Governmentwould be prepared to give an undertaking to protect the lives and property of British nationals and an assurance that they do not seek to alter the status and- administration of the International Settlement except inconsultation with the other parties concerned,,B*   Passage of supplies through Hongkong.Before returning a-reply to this question His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be glad to learn the specific causes of corn-plaint., since the transit of munitions and war materials overthe frontier of Hongkong has in fact been prohibitedsince .

2.since January 1939 and the territories adjacent to thecolony are in occupation by Japanese forcesBG.   Stoppage of   supplies to China through Burma.His Majesty&apos;s Government have taken note of the viewsof the Japanese Government with regard to the transport ofarms, ammunition and supplies via Burma to the national government of China0It is true that the passage of certain arms and munitions to the National Government of China does take place viaBurma, but the total figures for 1939 and those for thefirst five months of 1940 lend no support to the view thatthis traffic affords any very material contribution to the armed strength of the Chinese National Government.   the specific war material from the United Kingdom from 27thNovember last to the end of May 19A-09 which was carried overthe Burma route to China, was insignificant.   It is more-over obvious from the wide commitments of His Majesty^Government in their own war effort that, quite apart fromany undertaking which the Japanese Government might invitethem to give, His Majesty&apos;s Government are in fact unableto supply China with munitions of war.    His Majesty&apos;sGovernment therefore would find themselves unable to acceptthe view that the supply of war materials by Great britain to the National Government of China is a direct cause of the prolongation of the hosti.litieseIt is hovfever noted that the Japanese Government Intheir communication refer not only to arms and aimuunition, butalso to fuel, fuel oil and petrol, tracks and railway materials,,His Majesty&apos;s Government find difficulty in appreciating thebasis on which the request is made to stop the passage ofthese materials, certain of Y/hich are products of Burma itself.In so far as this route is a legitimate trade route whichcontributes to the welfare of the people of Burma and India,His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that In making this request the Japanese are asking them to take action which is inconsistent with their obligations to these two countries.It is obvious that the relations of His Majesty&apos;s Govem-ment with the United States of America are also involvedin the Japanese request, since this route is largely usedfor the passage of  American products.   It should bo addedthat in   strict neutrality a request to cut off the materials in question from China should involve a similar stoppage of supplies to Japan, but this of course is in no waythe intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The

5.The Japanese Government will recall thatin connexion with the European war His Majesty*sGovernment have &quot;been endeavouring to secure theirassent to the stoppage of certain materials toGermany with whom the United Kingdom are explicitlyat war.      While the Japanese Government haveexpressed their willingness, under certain conditions,to undertake not to re-export to Germany goods which they have purchased from the British Empire,they have been unwilling to consider giving suchan assurance in respect of similar goods from other sources and have been unwilling even to discuss thelimitation of exports via Siberia of goods produced in Japan and Manchukuo.      In the meantime thetrade with Germany continues.His Majesty&apos;s Government have noticed with regret a tendency in certain quarters in Japan tomaintain that whereas the Japanese Government havebeen strictly neutral in their attitude towards thewar between Great Britain and Germany,   His majesty&apos;s government are on the contrary solely responsiblefor the resistance offered by the National Governmentof China towards Japan.      It is hoped that theJapanese Government will take note of the true attitudeof His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom,who have from the outset deplored the hostilities between Japan and China while not departing from their obligations to other Powers. His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave sought to do everything in their power to improve relations between Great Britain and Japan.      Theyhave on various occasions expressed their readiness,should both parties so desire, to use their endeavours to bring these hostilities to a close.        this attitude has in no way changed, and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment take this opportunity of renewing theoffer of their good offices to bring about a just and equitable peace.
