THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.W.P.(kO)  258e11TH JULY, 1940, COPY m. fZ(r?WAR CABINET,,FPJJNCH EQUATORIAL AND v7SSg APRIOA,memorandum^ndum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.At their meeting on trie 7th July, the War cabinet approved the despatch of a telegram to the Governor of nigeria authorising him to inform the French Governors-General of the Carneroons that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould in case of need collaborate fully in the effectivemaintenance of the administration of that Territory.2o Ui, Brunot, the Governor-General, has how promulgatedan official decree vesting in himself authority tocontinue the administration, maintain the defences of theTerritory intact, and discharge the Mandate obligations,and announcing that he will work in close collaboration with His Majesty1s Government, calling on it for protectionif necessarye3, In view of this most satisfactory outcome of ourinitiative in the Cameroonst I now ask the Cabinet toauthorise me to apply the same measures, with such localmodifications as may he necessary, to French equaltorial africa and those parts of French West   Africa which adjoinour own West African Colonies,,Uc In these French Territories we have evidence thatthere is widespread resentment at the capitulation ofthe Petain Government, and a desire on the part of severallocal authorities to work with us0     For example, the french in the Province of Chad (Equatorial Africa) have put themselves in touch with General de Gaulle,     The governor of Nigeria,, who has received?, visit from the PoliticalSecretary to the French Governor at Fort Lamy, reportsthat the attitude of the Governor and the militaryauthorities is most promising.     It is most desirable thatwe should use all the means that present themselves toclinch matters while the French local authorities are inthis mood, and link them with us In a strong central african block,5, In French West Africa, however, the   French localauthorities are now beginning to adopt a cooler attitudetowards us and seem inclined to acquiesce in the peace terms accepted by the Petain Government.

lack of leadership which has undermined their originalresolve.     The French Colonial administrations, havingalways been very closely tied to metropolitan France,have no tradition of self-government or responsibility to fall back on now that they are suddenly thrown on theirown resources.     The failure of the attempt to set up analternative &quot;free&quot; French Government in North Africa, andthe equivocal attitude of the Governor-General at Dakar,have meant that the local authorities in West Africa areunable, of their own accord, to take the responsibilityof cutting off from their home Government and throwing intheir lot with us.     Fear of reprisals on their families inFrance has no doubt also helped to undermine their morale.In the absence of a definite lead on our part, the localadministrations in French West Africa feel that we- arenot interested in their fate, and it is most important that we should do what we can to stop the rot while thereis still time to do so.6.        The Territories concerned, besides French EquatorialAfrioa,   are the Niger Colony, Dahomey, and Togoland, theIvory Coast, and French Guinea,     These territories areof great strategical importance to us, as they interlockgeographically with our own West and Central african colonies, and clearly a strong case exists for our takingthe initiative to strengthen our friendly influence overthem now while goodwill towards us still exists, ratherthan wait until that asset lias faded away.7. In whatever action is taken it would of course bemade clear that the sovereignty of French territoriesremains in French hands, and that our intervention is atemporally measure taken by the caramon consent of both parties.     The ostensible symbols of French rule, e,g. theFrench flag, would be retained in order to protect usagainst the charge of exploiting the situation to seizeFrench territory for ourselves88,        At its meeting on the 10th July the VansittartCommittee expressed the strong opinion that this policy,which ha3 been successfully followed in the Cameroons,should be extended to the neighbouring French territories.9. I therefore recommend that we should givediscretion to our West African Governors to offer to thelocal French authorities in these areas the same measureof collaboration in maintaining the effective administrationof their territories as that already approved by theCabinet in the case of the French Cameroons.Colonial Office,11th July, 19hO.
