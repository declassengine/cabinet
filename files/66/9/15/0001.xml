No reference is made in the telegram to the suggestionregarding the despatch of an Economic Mission to Washington,in view of the informal approach since received by theChancellor of the Exchequer from the United States Treasury,which it may be hoped, will serve to open discussions on some ofthe questions which I had in mind when I put forward thissuggestion in my Paper W.P.(40)  214 Revise.(Intd)      A.

ASSISTANCE REQUIRED PROM THE UNITED STATESTelegram No. 1326 dated 30th June,.1940,to H.M. Ambassador, Washington._(Text agreed upon by the Minister without portfolio after consultation with theMinisters concerned.)MEDIATEMy telegram No. 1168 last paragraph (of 18th June:    UnitedStates&apos; assistance).1. His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided that the time has now arrived at which it is imperative to approach the United states administration on the lines indicated in paragraphs A to Ebelow.A. His Majesty&apos;s Government have made a thoroughreview of the economic situation created by the collapse of French resistance and they desire to impress upon theUnited States Administration their conviction that, inorder to achieve victory at the earliest possible moment,we must look to the United States to furnish us with supplies of aircraft and other munitions and essentialraw materials on an altogether larger scale than hitherto.B. In the altered circumstances it is imperative thatthe Administration should realise the farreaching changesin industrial organisation which are essential if allresources are to be concentrated on war effort.    Our ownsupply programmes have suffered from slowness ofrealisation of this facto   We are anxious that the UnitedStates Government should profit by our mistakes.    It willbe necessary for you to impress on the Administrationthat full production for war purposes cannot be securedmerely by expansion and development of munitions and ancillary industries, other industries being leftunaffected.    Establishment of requisite priority for labour, materials, machine tools etc. will necessarily involved prompt curtailment of production for domesticcivilian consumption.   We hope that the administration will recognise this and guide United States opinion torealise it as an essential factor in their ownrearmament effort.    Where total available supplies are limited (e.g. raw materials such as aluminium and steelor machine tools) we hope that the Administration willopen immediate discussion with us on allocations asbetween themselves,  ourselves and Canada to secure themaximum possible production with the utmost promptitude.As regards raw materials we hope also that it will bepossible that those Central and South American states as are important producers should be included in thearrangements we propose should be made.

Co      So long as the gold and other foreign assets at our disposal permit, we shall of course continue to pay cashfor essential armaments, raw materials, and foodstuffs,hut we desire to impress upon the Administration in the clearest possible manner the utter impossibility of our continuing to do this for any indefinite period in viewof the scale on which we shall need to obtain suchresources from the United States,,    Our immediate anxietyarises from the necessity of entering into long-termcontractsoD. There is a considerable risk that, with thedevelopment of total war and the consequent great increasein the calls on the Royal Navy, our Merchant Marine mayfor a time at least suffer a much higher rate of lossesthan hitherto.    We therefore ask that the Administration,either by the amendment of the Neutrality Act ov otherwise,will take steps to secure the withdrawal at the earliestpossible moment of the present embargo on ships flying theUnited States flag entering the war zone, to the extent necessary to permit such ships to bring imports to thiscountryo    If they are prepared to do this, we would urge that the Administration jointly with ourselves should immediately examine the possibilities of devising measuresto secure the most effective joint use for our war purposes of the mercantile fleets of the United States, ofthis country and our Allies and of the Central and south american States0E. There are a number of ways in which Germany and italy might obtain resources from America,  and we accordinglydesire to press the Administration:-(i)  either by the use of powers to be conferred underthe Defence Bill now before Congress or by a development of the present &quot;moral&quot; embargo toput a complete stop to all exports direct or indirect from the United States to Germany andItaly and to the countries occupied by thosestates,  including France; and to limit those to other dangerous destinations;(ii)  further as regards those products of which thereis likely to be a world surplus (eog0 cotton,maize, wheat,  edible oils) we feel it is of theutmost urgency that our plans and those of our allies for dealing with surpluses in our overseas possessions should be concerted withthose of the U,S,,Ao  and of the other states inthe Western Hemisphere,,    For fuller statementof our views please see Arfar telegram No,  1070;(iii) to obtain any supplementary powers needed to block financial balances and other assetsbelonging to Germany or Italy or to nationals of enemy occupied countries;(iv) to take steps to render impossible the return fromthe United States to Europe of German and Italiantechnicians either for military service or for employment as skilled operatives in the munitions industry:;(v)  to use their good offices with the Governmentsof the Central and South American States tosecure the adoption by those Governments of measures parallel to those indicated in (i) to(iv) above

20     I leave to youv discretion the precise manner in whichthe foregoing considerations should be put to the Administration,but it is of the utmost importance that they should be sopresented as to make it clear that in the considered opinion ofHis IVIajesty&apos;s Government the adoption of the measures asked for is necessary to enable us to defend our common civilisation.We hope that you will be able to act with the utmost despatch,since a report on the Administrations reactions to all thepoints raised is urgently required,,3. -   We feel that it is essential that Canada should be associated with us in this rvpp roach.   We have accordinglyinformed the Canadian Government by telegram through the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner of the lines on which we are askingyou to act and have urged that they- should instruct yourCanadian colleague to place himself in immediate touch with you with a view to the joint or parallel presentation of our common needs.
