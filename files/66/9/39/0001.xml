The conquest of Prance hy Germany raises in an acuteform the question of applying measures of. contraband control to Spain and Portugal,2.     Before the collapse of Prance, contraband goodscould reach Germany or Italy through Spain, only if they were carried hy air or smuggled across the Gulf of Genoa.    Goods cannow pass overland through Spain directly into German-occupied territory, indirectly via &quot;unoccupied&quot; Prance and, without muchrisk of interference, hy sea to Italy.    Moreover, Spain and portugal are now the only European neutrals which can offer animportant channel for contraband traffic.    It is obvious that,unless we &quot;block this channel,  it may be used hy the enemy todraw supplies on a large scale from overseas.3.      There is another danger.    Spain has already declaredherself &quot;non-belligerent&quot; and there is a serious risk thatshe may he forced by Italy and Germany to go to war against us. Thus,   if she is allowed to accumulate stocks now,  she willhe less vulnerable to our blockade after she has entered thewar.    We must not allow her to make such preparations.   We mustsecure that,  as a belligerent,  she shall be an economic liabilityand not an asset to Germany.h.,      Portugal is less directly exposed to German pressure.The present Portuguese Government is not likely to promote thepassage of supplies to the enemy, but it cannot effectivelycontrol the trade across its frontier with Spain.    The iberian peninsula must,  therefore, he treated as a whole.5.     If the blockade is to be effectively applied in this area, we must aim at limiting imports of all forms of contrabandinto Spain and Portugal to such amounts as are required for internal consumption only.    On the other hand, there is reasonto believe that influential elements in Spain would try to seize upon anything which could he represented as an unfriendlyact on our part to bring Spain into the war forthwith.    Adecision by us to ration Spain, unless it was very carefullypresented, might give these elements their excuse.    I propose,therefore,  in order to reduce this danger that, while rationingSpanish imports, we should also guarantee to Spain the supplyof the goods so rationed.6.      I suggest that we approach the Spanish Government*- on the following lines.   We should inform them that, since mostWestern European countries have now fallen under German control,we are forced to apply the blockade to the whole Westernseaboard of Europe;    that we desire that Spain should not suffer from this blockade;  that we are,  therefore, prepared not onlyto make arrangements for the passage through our controls of reasonable quantities of the goods required for her consumptionbut also to give her every assistance in our power to obtainthese supplies.    Detailed arrangements would be a matter for later discussion.   We should make a similar communication to the Portuguese Government with regard to Portuguese imports.

We should insist that,  in return for these guaranteedrations, the Spanish and Portuguese Governments should furnxshus with the supplies which we require, especially iron ore.At the same time, we should be ready to buy up, without delay,any Spanish and Portuguese products of value to the enemy and of which adequate supplies are not available to himelsewhere,  such as lead, wolfram,  olive oil and sardines.8.      If this policy is to beto enforce the rations we allow,be done byeffective, we must be ableTo some extent this could(a)    control of exports at source, for which,however,  the co-operation of the U.S.and South American Governments would be essential.md(b)    control of world, shippingcBoth these methods are now being intensively studied by myMinistry in collaboration with the other Departments concerned,9.      These methods of stopping undesirable traffic atthe source cannot, however, be put into full operationimmediatelyt    Naval action also will still be necessary, atany rate for some time to come.    Our patrols will not be ableto intercept more than a small number of the ships approachingEurope, while to divert even a proportion of these under .armed guards to British or West African ports would be atroublesome procedure.    It seems, therefore, that the objectof any naval action which we take must primarily be to deterships from coming to Europe.10.      One method of doing this would be to make Ship&apos;sNavicerts compulsory and to treat all ships sailing to europe without Ship&apos;s Navicerts,  or clearances from empire countries,  as blockade runners to be seized in prize.    lord lothian has recently urged that our policy should followthese lines.    He is sure that, if a few un-navicerted ships are detained,  the shipowners will insist on all cargo beingnavicerted and he has reported that the State Departmenthave themselves advised us to put difficulties in the way ofships carrying un-navicerted cargo.    It is clear, therefore,that the U.S. Government will not raise difficulties.    I attach,  in Annex I, extracts from a recent telegram receivedfrom Washington on this subject.11.     -Such use of the Navicert system has no legalprecedent, but we must seek to make the law fit the war and Iam glad to say that the Attorney-General,  the Procurator-General and my own legal adviser are agreed that,  in presentcircumstances, the new system can &quot;be justified,    A Minutesetting forth the legal arguments and the type of announcement which might be made is attached in Annex II,12.     But I must emphasise the extreme importance ofbacking a compulsory Navicert system with effective navalsanctions,..    To declare that we will henceforth seize allun-npvicerted ships and then to fail to do so would be disastrous,,    I understand that the Admiralty doubt whetherit is any longer practicable to bring ships into port forseizure,  and that they are considering other proposals for more drastic action.    Prom the point of view of EconomicWarfarej: I should welcome any proposal which,  in the judgment of the Admiralty, would be effective.- -
I,  therefore,  recommend:(1)    That we should at once approach the Spanishand Portuguese Governments with an offer of guaranteedrations on the lines suggested in paragraph 6 above,(2)    That I should he authorised,  in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  to make suchpre-emptive purchases in Spain and Portugal as mayhe practicable.(3)    That a declaration should be issued forthwithon the lines suggested in paragraph 10 above and annex II,  it being understood that the admiralty have under consideration the measures necessaryto make this declaration effective.H.D..THE MINISTER OP ECONOMIC WARFARE12th July,  19h0.
ANNEX   .1.Extract from Telegram No. 1559 Arfar from the Marquessof Lothian, Washington, 8th July, 19hQ.__&quot;Your departments are probably disappointed at our inability-hitherto to get the United States Government to exercise effective control of exports beyond what nay be done under the Defence Actregulations which, as you know, do not cover such importantmaterials as oil,copper and scrap.  ...&quot;&quot;I realise that our naval forces are limited and the calls on them unnuraerab1e, but if any naval units at all can be spared for afew weeks, the effect of real difficulties for a number of ships carrying un-navicerted cargoes to Petsamo, to Spain, Portugal andpast Gibraltar would be such that Navicerting would become generaland our control over exports from this country in fact complete.Once this were done, I should not despair of getting the UnitedStates authorities to develop their existing precautions againstfalse manifest declarations etc.      In this way if all consignmentswere navicerted,  they would in practice effect a loading check forus.      Could you not announce that as from a certain date, e.g.August 1st, no consignment to a neutral European port   will   be passed by the Contraband Controls unless it is accompanied   by   avalid Navicert issued before shipment ?     We are convinced that theeffect would be immediate.Relatively few ships need actually be stopped.        The merethreat would thereafter be enough for our purpose.The effect would also be lasting provided that even ifrelatively few ships were stopped in practice, the rule wereuniversally and rigidly applied to any stopped.I realise that my proposal takes no account of prize courtevidence but I trust in our present situation, we should not allowlegal or even political niceties to debar us from using a weaponwhich with comparatively little effort would give most effectiveresults.      Moreover I do not think opposition need be anticipatedfrom the United States Government so long as United States ships are not taken into the combatant zone.        It would, however, be essential that navicert decisions be notified much more promptlythan has been the case in recent months.  &quot;

ANNEX II.Minute by Mr. Fitzmaurice (Legal Adviser, Ministry ofEconomic Warfare)Concurred in by Attorney-General. Procurator-General and legal Adviser &quot;to Foreign Off ice&quot;.In the circumstances which have arisen I think thatthe course suggested could be legally justified.    Normally aNavicert is only a facility which the shipper is not in any waybound to avail himself of.      Therefore, the absence of aNavicert does not of itself raise any presumption of enemydestination or justify seizures     But as things are now, Ithink that action having the effect of making Navicertsobligatory and their absence a ground for seizure could bejustified by means of some announcement on the following lines:(1)    In view of recent events and in particular theunavailability of French ports for purposes of contraband control, H.Mo Government will be obliged, unless some alternative system can be found, to divert many shipsapproaching Europe to distant ports for examination.Although HoM0 Government would have a perfect right to do this,  they are unwilling to cause the delay and inconveniencewhich would arise, if this can be avoided.,      In consequence,they propose to universalize the system of Navicerts.      since in future Navicerts will, therefore, be available to shippersall over the world, and since H.M.  Government do not normallyrefuse a Navicert except where they suspect an actual orpotential enemy destination^ any un-navicerted cargo will,in future, be regarded as suspect and will be liable to heseized as prize0(2)    HoMc Government also propose to universalize thesystem of Ship&apos; s Navicerts,,      Since these Navicerts will beavailable to vessels coming to Europe from any overseas port,and since ship-owners will presumably wish to avoid the considerable delays which may be involved by the diversion of ships to port for examination, it will be assumed thatany vessel not in possession of a Ship&apos;s Navicert has sailedwithout one deliberately and with the full knowledge of herownero      It will also follow that such a ship will almost certainly be carrying un-navicerted cargo since otherwise there would be no bar to the possession of a Ship&apos;s NavicertoFor reasons explained above, un-navicerted cargo will be presumed to have an enemy destinations      The resulting position will be that the ship can be presumed to be carrying contrabandto Europe   with the knowledge of her ownere    According torecognised principals of Prize Law, the carriage of contrabandwith the knowledge of the owner of the ship renders the vesselliable to confiscationa      In the circumstances, therefore, anyship intercepted on its way to Europe and not in possession ofa Ship&apos;s Navicert will be liable to be seized as Prize.It will be seen that the foundation stone upon whichthis case will have to be erected is that Navicerts are onlyrefused where there is so .e reason to suspect an actual orpotential enemy destination,      In many cases, of course,refusal occurs for other reasons.     But while we must, I thihkjmaintain that we only refuse on account of suspected enemydestination, I do not think that in practice v/e need greatlyalter our policy as regards granting or refusing NavicertSoIt
It may be that in certain cases we shall be held to haveseized cargo without any adequate prima facie justificationand shall incur damages in the Prize Court.      This risk isone that must be run.     But, further, I think we shall bejustified, in existing circumstances, in giving considerableextension to the notion of what constitutes a potential enemydestination and that we shall be supported by the prize court in so doing, at any rate for the purpose of avoidingdamage.      I will not elaborate this idda here, which is bound up with the notion that the whole of Europe must now beregarded as being actually or potentially under enemy controland all goods imported into it as being actually or potentiallyat enemy disposal.11th July, 191*0.
