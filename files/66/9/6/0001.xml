THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.S E OR E T.WAR cabinet copy NO i 3. f).28TH JUNE. 1940.SITUATION IN ALGERIA AND FRENCH MOROCCO.Memorandum by the Minister of Information.The Administration and Chief Service Officers haveapparently decided to throw in their lot with the BordeauxGovernment.The reasons appear to be briefly as follows:-1 . (a)    CIVIL.The higher officials are prepared to follow any government provided their personal positions are notjeopardised.      The armistice terms do not apparently involve any changes in the administration of Algeria and Moroccoand the officials, reassured as to their future prospects,are quite ready to obey the orders of the Bordeaux Government.(b) MILITARY.Large numbers of troops were removed to take part inthe battle of Prance.     As a result the French are out-numbered both on the Spanish and Italian frontiers.      the generals are therefore reluctant to take any action whichis likely to provoke an attack from either quarter.(c) NAVAL.Whilst professing continued friendship for GreatBritain and determination never to hand over their ships tothe enemy, the Admirals are so stunned by events that theyare incapable of the mental or physical effort necessary to avert the consequences which they professedly deplore.      this attitude and their goodwill are deteriorating daily.2. In general, the younger officers and the rank and file are in favour of continuing the struggle.      This appliesequally to the civilian population, most of whom are stillunaware of the armistice terms.      In Algiers a committee ofprominent citizens has been formed to organise continuedresistance.      They have received no encouragement from theCivil Authorities, but Lord Dillon is in touch with them andwas passing in to them an American offer of rifles. ammunitionetc.     According to the Consul General, the Moors (from the sultan downwards) will not take kindly to the armistice terms and would gladly continue to fight.

3. These elements will, however, remain disjointedand ineffective unless a definite lead is given.      If someauthority, commanding universal respect, would come intothe open and stoutly proclaim a policy of continuedresistances he would not lack supporters.     Many wavererswould rally to such a cause and the present loyalty to theBordeaux Government would soon show itself to he the resultof a passing panic and to lack roots.The problem is to find the rallying point.M. Mandel and his friends have apparently been discouraged by their reception at Casablanca and are now proposing tocome to England., if in fact they are allowed to depart.General Nogues or M. Morize will never lead a popularmovement.     M. Perouton9 the President in Tunis, is more highly spoken of and might be a possibility.I have come to che conclusion that the only wayto capitalise the elements favourable to us and toprevent the gradual, possibly rapid, establishment of italian and Spanish hegemony over the coast of north africa is to intervene ourselves and to land an expedi-tionary force in Morocco.     What I envisage would bea mixed force of British, Canadian, Australian, and indian battalions, landed, if possible, from french ships and accompanied by French loyalists, who have preferred not to surrender.      Such an expedition would,I am convinced, encounter lictle armed resistance, andwith the enthusiastic support of the local population would ensure for the Ames that command of the north african coast line v/hich is essential for the maintenanceof our blockade of the Enemy Powers.      If Spain isforced into the War, the retention of Gibraltar will prove almost impossible, but if we were in possessionof Casablanca and the Atlantic coast of Morocco, we could still command the Straits.     Lord Gort was of the opinionthat Casablanca is of strategic importance to the allied cause and before leaving I asked the Governor of gibraltar, who shared this view, to submit a report onthe subject after consultation with Admiral Sir DudleyNorth.Speed is essential and I suggest that thisquestion should be examined without delay by theChiefs of Staffs.(Intld)       D.  C...S8TH JUNE,  1940.
