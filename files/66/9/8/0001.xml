THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SHOBETW.P.(40)  228. WAJj      CABINET. Copy No.j O28th June,1940.ASSISTANCE TO EIRE IN SHE EVENT 01 GERMAN ATTACK.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.At their meeting on the 1st June (War Cabinet 151(40)Conclusion 13) the War Cabinet approved a report by the Chiefsof Staff (W.p.(40)183) recommending acceptance of the principlethat miilitary support should be provided t6 the Government of eire immediately it is called for.&apos; iThe question has now been raised of the detailed methodof dealing with such a request if and when it is received, andthe United Kingdom Representative to Eire has asked that clearinstructions may be given on this point in order that nomisunderstanding may exist.There are two questions:-(a) Is a request for assistance from militaryauthorities in Eire to be accepted or must a request from the Eire Government be awaited?(b) If a request is received may the General OfficerCommanding in Chief in Northern Ireland act at onceor is he to await specific authorisation from London?(a) The United Kingdom Representative reports that theview of the Eire Government is that any such request should bemade by them and not by any military authority in Eire.Sir John Maffey endorses this view on the ground of the riskinvolved in premature action, which might result from anill-considered appeal from some subordinate officer in Eire.Presumably,  therefore, we should accept the view thatthe request should come from the Eire Government.     It shouldbe addressed to Sir John Maffey as the United kingdom representative in Dublin, or his Deputy.(b)   As the essence of the whole problem is speed, it issuggested that Sir John Maffey should be authorised to passany such request immediately to the General Officer commanding in Chief, Northern Ireland, v/ho would be authorised to actupon it without further authority from London.     At the sametime Sir John Maffey would report to London that the requesthas been received and that he has forwarded it to the GeneralOfficer Commanding in Chief.Detailed arrangements will also be drawn up to meetas far as possible any difficulties arising from a breakdown in communications.&apos;I should be glad to know whether the War Cabinetapprove the proposals set out under (a) and (b) above.28th June,   1940
