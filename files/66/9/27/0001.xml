THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SJLP-JLJLT.2ND JULY. ISkO.COPY NO,WAR CABINET.R0D.P.Iemcarandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster.(For the Information ofr the War Cabinet).On the 26th April last the late War cabinet invited me, as Chairman of the Ministerial Committee onPriority,  to look into the question of priority in thevarious applications of R,D0F.      Shortly after the changeof Government there was a reorganisation under whichresponsibility for priority went elsewhere, but I have continued the investigation into R.D.F.  and this memorandumhas been prepared in order to report progress.Priority in the various applications of R.D.F.2. The question of priorities between the differentapplications of R.D0F. was disposed of within a day or two.I found that a Standing Interdepartmental Committee, whichhad been set up as long ago as November, 1938, was on thepoint of presenting a report on the priorities ofproduction, research and the development of the variousapplications of R.D.F,, which had the support of all theGovernment Departments concerned.      Representations weremade to me from authoritative quarters that this Committeewas doing admirable work under the Chairmanship of AirVice-Marshal Douglas, that it was giving completesatisfaction to the Government Departments conoerned, andthat it was most undesirable to interfere with it.Moreover,  the Report of the Committee was very complete and in entire accord with my own views.      ConsequentlyI pursued that aspect of the question no farther.Priority of material.3. -   I then directed my attention to difficulties that had arisen in obtaining machine tools, high-grade steel and materials generally, due to the fact perhaps that R.D.F.does not concern a single Department but all Departments.With the co-operation of the late Minister of Supply this difficulty was speedily overcome,  and the late War Cabinet

decided on 3rd May that high -priority should he givento R.D.F. requirements.Personnel.h. The third requirement, namely, additionalpersonnel of various kinds, could not he solved quiteso rapidly, hut steady progress is being made and theposition has already improved considerably.5. The requirements of the Departments concerned,namely, the Admiralty, Air Ministry, Ministry of aircraft Production and Ministry of Supply, covered notonly highly trained Scientific Officers and theirAssistants, but also Laboratory Assistants, Draughtsmen andMechanics.      For the purposes of R.D.F.  it is only possibleto use men who have previously been accustomed to wireless and similar specialised work.      There was already a bigcall on men with this special experience which increased the difficulty of obtaining additional staff.6. As the result of meetings to consider the probleman approach was made to the following possible sourcesThe Post Office, who have been most helpful.The B.B.C.The Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry, witha view to combing out men with special knowledge.Private firms in the radio business.The Dominions.The Foreign Office, with a view to securingvolunteers from among British subjects inthe United States of America.7. Good results have already been obtained,  as willbe seen from the table attached to this Report.      Theservices of appropriate personnel have been obtained or arein course of being obtained from all the sources mentionedabove in paragraph 6, except the Dominions and the UnitedStates of America, and in those cases there has not yetbeen time to obtain results.      Contact has also been madewith British members of a French firm who were engaged on the problem for the French Government, and it is hoped to enlist their services.      In addition, the loan of theservices of two experienced Engineers, who have teenworking on this problem for the Dutch Government, was obtained from the Dutch Naval authorities.8. Arrangements have been made with the security service to deal with the personnel obtained for R.D.F.as quickly as possible.

9o I hope that still more personnel will he madeavailable from some of these sources, and I think it isnow fair to state that the intake of skilled personnelis as great as the establishment can absorb, with theexception of Laboratory Assistants and possibly skilledMechanics.,      Prom the Table in the Appendix however,  itwill be seen that the problem has substantially beensolved.(Initialled)    H,55, Whitehall, S,W. 102nd July, 1940.

(1)   The table does not include the requirements for Calibration staff, the great majority of which falls in the Skilled Workman class.(2)   The most immediate shortage - draughtsmen for Admiralty and Air Ministry -- has now been supplied,i but it is certain that there will be additional requirements as the new officer and assistanti staff become productive.(3)   The outstanding deficiencies of the Admiralty and Air Ministry require to be made good at themaximum rate of absorption in the Establishments.The figures for the Ministry of Supply show the requirements during the next twelve months, a proportion only being required now.(4) The most difficult deficiency to supply is that for skilled Mechanics, particularly for theAdmiralty. The difficulty lies in the relatively low rates of pay we are able to offer, ifdisturbance of existing staff is to be avoided.x Since this statement was drawn up I have just been informed that owing to a modification in theorganisation of the Air Ministry, R.D.F. Maintenance Group, there is an urgent additionalrequirement for 52 Laboratory Assistants.     This figure should be added to the deficiency of17 shown in the table above.(Intld. )   H.3.7.40.I\3
