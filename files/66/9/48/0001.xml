C R S T.W. P.(40)268.17TH JULY, 1940.WAR CABINET.PROPOSAL TO OFFER A BRIGADE OF LONDON IRISHFOR:SERVICE IN EIRE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.At a meeting of Ministers on 21st June,, 1940, it wasagreed, inter alia, that the possibility of offering theLondon Irish, perhaps expanded to a Brigade, for service in eire should be explored.    (D,0.(40)18th Meeting)02.        . There are at present only two battalions of LondonIrish, one in the 1st, and one in the 2nd, London Division,,i   COPY NO    bIf these battalions are taken away, the organisationof these divisions will be dislocated, and there are noother battalions which can be used to replace them.From the point of view of organisation, therefore,there are strong reasons against removing these battalions atthe present time.30 There is little prospect of being able to raiseimmediately a third battalion of Irishmen.    To do this it would be necessary to take individuals from several units and much time would be required before a satisfactory unitcould be produced,4. The composition of the London Irish, based on place of birth, is as follows1st Bna 2nd Bn.Northern Ireland &quot; 12-g% 14%Eire I5 j6 9%Elsewhere 72% 77%5. From the composition of these battalions, there seemsno strong reason to suppose that they would prove more acceptable to Mr. De Valera than other British units.    Inview of the difficulties in organisation that would result,I recommend that the proposal should not be furtherpursued,(Intld. )     A.E.Richmond Terrace, S.W.L17TH JULY, 1940o
