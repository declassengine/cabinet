In the rapidly changing situation itis quite impossible to foresee the form such hostility might take, and we still hopethat the French will never actively participate with the Germans and the Italiansin deliberate offensive operations against their recent ally. Nevertheless, thepossibility remains that they may be persuaded to go to great lengths, and wehave accordingly reviewed in some detail the military implications of an activelyhostile France.We present below the conclusions we have drawn from our review, and we attach as an annex the detailed appreciation from which these were taken. Atthe same time we put forward certain recommendations outlining the measureswhich we consider should be taken to meet the situation.CONCLUSIONS.2. We sum up the Military implications of French hostility in the following terms r General.(a) We shall be faced with a considerable added Naval commitment due tothe altered balance of Naval strengths. This will apply particularly to the Mediterranean where the situation will be altered greatly to our disadvantage and to our Atlantic trade routes which will be exposed to an increased scale of attack, particularly if any enemy forces operatefrom French West African ports.(b) The enemy will gain the use of French bases both at home and overseas.[21496] b
(c) We shall be faced with certain additional defence commitments in someof our overseas possessions as a result of the threat from neighbouringFrench territory.(d) We must expect French industry to be diverted to German and Italianpurposes.(e) The French Metropolitan army constitutes no immediate threat, and itis unlikely that the few French air forces left in France will be used inoffensive operations against us in the immediate future. On the otherhand, the bulk of the French air force is now in North Africa and maywell be used to attack Gibraltar, Malta and such naval forces as maybe operating in the Central and Western Mediterranean.(f) We are in a good position to influence by economic pressure the attitudeof the more isolated French Colonies.Naval Implications.(g) Apart from enemy Naval operations in the Mediterranean where theposition will be altered greatly to our disadvantage, we must face the possibility of French Naval action on the following lines : (i) Submarine operations in the Western approaches and off theWest Coast of Africa; also in the Caribbean and WesternAtlantic should the French decide to disregard Americansusceptibilities (paragraph 13).(ii) Anti-trade operations from Casablanca and Dakar, and possiblyfrom Martinique. Anti-trade operations from Dakar wouldbe so serious that it would be necessary to undertake such naval operations against it as would prevent its being used(paragraph 13).(iii) A raid on Freetown (paragraph 24).(iv) At the same time, it is possible that enemy raiders may make use of French bases further afield, such as Diego Suarez(Madagascar) (paragraphs 37-39).(h) Due to the defeat of France our control of sea communications in theCentral and Western Mediterranean can only be sporadic. In theEastern Mediterranean our control of communications to Libya hasbeen weakened, but at that point which is farthest from Egypt. Frenchhostility, though adding to our difficulties, should not prevent us frommaintaining a fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean (paragraph 28).Position of British Naval Bases and Territories Overseas.(i) Gibraltar may be exposed to a heavy scale of air attack from FrenchMorocco, and may become unusable (paragraph 18).(j) If Gibraltar becomes unusable as a result of enemy action from Frenchbases in North Africa it would be very desirable that we should obtain an alternative fuelling base and an air base in the Azores, and thatwe should deny the use of both the Cape Yerde Islands and the azores to the enemy. Unless there were clear indications that Spainintended to enter the war against us, however, it would not be toour advantage to precipitate Spanish and Portuguese hostility byoccupying these islands. Our control in the Atlantic would be limitedinitially to such measures as we can exercise from bases in the UnitedKingdom and from Freetown (paragraph 20).
(k) Freetown will be a link of first importance in bur Imperial sea communications and must be held and maintained. This port maybe exposed immediately to air and naval raids from French west african bases and eventually to a substantial scale of air and landattack. The defences of the port are at present inadequate(paragraphs 21-24).(1) Our remaining West African possessions will be exposed to Frenchattack. We cannot at present spare any reinforcements from home forthese territories (paragraphs 24 and 26).(m) It is already difficult to reinforce Malta. The presence of hostile french forces in North Africa would increase this threat and makereinforcement still more difficult. Nevertheless, it is important thatwe should maintain our position in Malta (paragraph 32).(n) We think it improbable that the French land forces in Syria, althoughsubstantial, would initiate offensive action against us in the nearfuture. If, however, as a result of a heavy scale of German andItalian air attack, it became necessary to withdraw the fleet from theEastern Mediterranean, German and Italian forces could be transported to Syria by sea. This would lead to a very serious situation, which would threaten the whole of our position in theMiddle East (paragraph 30).(o) The threat to British Somaliland would be increased. From the purely military point of view the only disadvantage of withdrawing fromSomaliland would be the effect on our prestige. It would not be inour interests to undertake an extensive commitment to hold british somali land (paragraph 44).Denial of French Bases to the Enemy.(p) Apart from those bases in Metropolitan France and North africa the use of which by the enemy we shall be unable to prevent, we must expect the enemy to be able to use the following French overseasbases: Casablanca,Dakar,Diego Suarez (Madagascar),Martinique [enemy use of this base is unlikely] (paragraph 9).(q) If the enemy had the undisputed use of Casablanca his naval forces wouldbe able to threaten our Atlantic Trade Routes. If he were free to operate from Dakar the effect would be so serious that it would be essential to take action to deny him the use of this base. Moreover,from either of these bases he would be in a position to attack our west african territories by land and air, and it will consequently be important to prevent him establishing and maintaining substantialforces in these territories by the sea line of communications(paragraphs 13 and 24).(r) We could not tolerate the use of Diego Suarez (Madagascar) as a base for enemy raiders, owing to its position on our trade routes in theIndian Ocean. The action we could take would be limited initiallyto naval and economic pressure. If forces became available we mighthave to consider the capture of this port (paragraphs 37-39).(s) We do not consider that the enemy are likely to use Martinique(paragraphs 40-42).(t) The French Islands in the Pacific are not likely to constitute a threat to our interests (paragraph 43).(u) No threat is likely to arise from French Indo-China (paragraph 45).
RECOMMENDATIONS.3. In the light of the present known attitude of the French we recommend the following immediate action : (a) The maintenance of a capital ship force based at Gibraltar.(b) The maintenance of our existing fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean.(c) Investigate the use of Takoradi as a convoy assembly port as analternative to Freetown.(d) Consideration of the practicability of diverting shipping from the west african route by (i) Diversion from Australia and New Zealand via the PanamaCanal.(ii) Diversion of suitable ships to Trinidad instead of to Freetown.(e) Consideration of the possibility of increasing the defences of Freetownby-(i) The despatch of A.A. guns.(ii) The development of accommodation for white troops,(hi) The despatch of troop reinforcements.(iv) Improvement of air facilities and despatch of aircraft as soonas they are available.(f) The expansion of our West African forces.(g) The situation in British Somaliland should be kept under constant review.(h) Development of an alternative air route to the Middle East from SouthAfrica.(i) An approach to the United States of America with a view to plans being prepared so that Martinique can be occupied by American forces orneutralised under American guarantee, if need be.(j) Immediate action should be taken to improve the defences of Malta.(k) Preparation of plans for the destruction of base facilities at Dakar by naval and fleet air arm action.(1) Preparation of plans for naval and economic action against the french colonial Empire.(Signed) C. L. N. NEWALL.DUDLEY POUND.J. G. DILL.
ANNEX.IMPLICATIONS OF FRENCH HOSTILITY.Detailed Appreciation.This appreciation deals primarily with the Military implications of anactively hostile France. The main assumptions we have made are that if theFrench assume an attitude of active hostility (a) All French bases at home and overseas will be available to our enemies.(b) French forces may be actively employed against us.(c) French industry will be diverted to German and Italian purposes.2. Generally speaking, the French collapse has had such a profound and widespread effect upon both the French fighting forces and the civil populationthat it is unlikely that the French themselves will be in a condition to undertakevigorous operations against us on a large scale for the present. This applies particularly to the French Metropolitan Army, which, now largely disarmed anddemoralised, is not likely to be employed in other than a purely defensive role inFrance. While the demoralisation is less marked in the colonies than at home,it is in the colonies that allegiance to the Bordeaux Government has so far been most divided. Nevertheless, the actions at Oran and Dakar, as well as theapplication of our blockade, may, if skilfully handled by German propaganda,rouse the French against us as nothing else could, and may go far towardscementing the French people and their overseas possessions behind the BordeauxGovernment. The French Navy have already shown, in spite of the good relations which have previously existed between the two Navies, that they will not hesitate to fight us if ordered to do so.3. On these assumptions, the most serious military effects of French hostilityare likely to be : (a) a considerable added naval commitment due to the altered balance ofnaval strengths;(&amp;) added defence commitments in some of our overseas possessions as a resultof the threat from neighbouring French territory;(c) overseas bases will be available to our enemies, flanking our mostimportant sea routes in the Atlantic, the Indian Ocean and the pacific.4.   The main considerations arising from French hostility are, therefore : (a) the naval situation;(b) the position of our own bases and territories overseas.   It is necessaryto determine which of these would be threatened as a result of Frenchhostility and which we must retain and if necessary reinforce;(c) which French bases we must deny to the enemy.THE naval SITUATION.French Naval Forces.5. From the information now available, the following French naval forces are still at large : 1 Battle-cruiser (damaged).1 Aircraft Carrier.4 Cruisers 8-inch.8 Cruisers 6-inch.22 Contre Torpilleurs (equivalent to large &quot; Tribals &quot;).10 Destroyers.44 Submarines.[21496]c
Added to the above are: 1 Battleship (Jean Bart 77 per cent, complete).1 Cruiser 6-inch.8 Destroyers.2 Contre Torpilleurs.17 Submarines.11 Armed Merchant Cruisers.which are at Dakar and Casablanca.6. Against the accretion to enemy strength we have ourselves already seizedin home ports : 2 Battleships.3 Contre Torpilleurs.2 Destroyers.8 Submarines.We also have immobilised in Alexandria: 1 Battleship.3 8-inch Cruisers.2 6-inch Cruisers.3 Destroyers.1 Submarine.Those in home ports will now become available for incorporation in our ownfleet, although difficulties in manning and maintenance may limit their usefulness.Those at Alexandria, though immobilised, are not yet in our hands and may still be sunk or rendered useless by the French crews still on board.7. The dispositions of the French naval forces, so far as they are known,are shown in the Appendix. The exact state and whereabouts of the French units in the Western Basin of the Mediterranean are not known, but it is probable thatthe majority are at or proceeding to Toulon.8. Broadly speaking, the dispositions of the French fleet can be summed up as follows : (a) The bulk of the fleet is in the Western Mediterranean;Cb) There are strong forces in the Eastern Atlantic at Casablanca and Dakar;(c) There are a few minor forces at other places overseas, of which the mostimportant are two cruisers (6-inch) and an aircraft carrier (modern)at Martinique and Guadeloupe.Broad Effects of French Hostility on the Naval Situation.9. The main effects of active French hostility on the naval situation will be &apos;(a) The balance of naval strength in the Mediterranean will be alteredgreatly to our disadvantage;(&amp;) There may be hostile forces outside the Mediterranean which are well placed to attack our vital Atlantic trade routes;(c) The enemy will gain defended bases overseas, the most important ofwhich are Casablanca and Dakar, flanking our main trade route to the cape;Martinique, flanking our trade routes through the PanamaCanal and the alternative route to the Cape, although the useof this base is unlikely in view of the probable Americanreactions.Diego Suarez (Madagascar), flanking our main trade routesin the Indian Ocean and round the Cape.In the Pacific, the possession of the Society Islands and theMarquesas and other French Islands will also provide undefendedanchorages flanking the main trade routes from Australia andNew Zealand to the Panama Canal.(d) Finally,  the French are in possession of much secret information regarding our naval dispositions, organisation, convoy arrangements,diversive routeing, defended ports and mine-fields, as well as muchtechnical knowledge of recognition signals, R.D.F. and Asdics. such information in enemy hands constitutes a grave danger.
Possible French Naval Action.10. We cannot say what action the French naval forces will take, as thiswill probably depend upon the state of morale of their crews. The Germans have,however, virtually released the French fleet from the demilitarisation terms ofthe armistice, and the French naval forces have shown that they are prepared to engage our own naval forces if ordered to do so.11. Apart from possible fleet operations in the Mediterranean, we must take into account following possible courses of action by French naval units : (a) A break out into the Atlantic and possibly further overseas;(b) Operations against our Atlantic trade by surface and submarine forces from Casablanca and Dakar;(c) Submarine operations in the Western Approaches from French north-western ports;(d) Raider operations from Martinique, Diego Suarez and possibly the pacific Islands;(e) Operations against Freetown.12. The French 8-inch cruisers have an endurance of 5,000 miles at15 knots and the 6-inch cruisers an endurance of 6,000 miles at 13 knots. Theycompare unfavourably in fighting qualities and endurance with our own 8-inchand modern 6-inch cruisers. With this endurance they would be unsuitable forextended raider operations far from their bases, and it is unlikely that, if theyleft the Mediterranean at all, they would be employed except in &quot;&apos; tip-and-run &quot;operations from bases in the Atlantic. The French light cruisers have anendurance of only 3,000 miles at 15 knots, which is insufficient for anti-tradeoperations in the Atlantic. The French armed merchant cruisers also have toolimited an endurance to be suitable for extended raider operations.13. It appears unlikely, therefore, that the French fleet will prove a seriousmenace to our trade outside the Atlantic, and their most probable course of action,apart from operations inside the Mediterranean, will be : (a) Submarine operations in the Western Approaches and oft&apos; the West coast of Africa; also in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic should theFrench decide to disregard American susceptibilities;(6) Anti-trade operations from Casablanca and Dakar, and possibly fromMartinique if the latter is available;(c) A raid on Freetown.At the same time, it is possible that German raiders may make use of Frenchbases further afield, such as Diego Suarez.British Naval counter-action.14. Our first aim in the event of French hostility must be to destroy thoseFrench units which are already outside the Mediterranean, and to prevent anyfurther units from breaking out into the Atlantic.15. To prevent surface ships from breaking out of the Mediterranean, itwould be necessary to maintain a capital ship force at Gibraltar. The balanceof naval strength will, however, now be such that we shall be unable to maintain a force there that will be superior to anything which it may have to meet.Nevertheless, we regard it as essential that we should now maintain as large a force as possible at Gibraltar so long as this base is usable. We consider in para-graph 20 below what our action should be if Gibraltar becomes unusable.16. We cannot be certain of preventing submarines, or even some surface ships, from breaking through the Straits of Gibraltar at night or under favourable weather conditions. If the enemy had the undisputed use of Casablanca his naval forces would be able to threaten our Atlantic trade routes, and if he were free to operate from Dakar, the effect would be extremely serious. Early naval action should, therefore, be taken to destroy the facilities at Casablanca and Dakar,particularly the latter, as soon as it is clear that these two bases must be regardedas hostile.
POSITION OF BRITISH NAVAL BASES AND TERRITORIESOVERSEAS.17. We now turn to consider the position of our own oversea bases inrelation to the naval situation if France becomes hostile. The most important of those which would be directly threatened by French hostility are gibraltar and Freetown.Gibraltar.18. We have always recognised that Gibraltar might eventually becomeunusable as a naval base if Spain intervened, and a similar situation wouldprobably arise if our enemies decide to launch an air offensive from Morocco.We should, of course, continue to use Gibraltar as long as possible.Atlantic Islands.19. We have recently been considering the desirability of seizing the cape verde Islands and the Azores with the object of : (a) Denying their use to the enemy and securing the cable stations for ourselves;(b) Securing an air base and a fuelling base in the Azores for our own use,should Gibraltar become unusable.We have reached the conclusion that there are certain circumstances in whichit would be in our interests to seize these islands, and we are shortly submitting areport to the War Cabinet inviting approval to their being seized (a) in the event of Spanish or Portuguese hostility;(5) when it becomes clear beyond reasonable doubt that either of these powers intends to intervene against us;(c) if the exercise of economic pressure by control at source or control ofshipping (methods on which we mainly rely for the prosecution of theblockade of Europe), fails to achieve adequate results and we have to rely more upon direct naval action.20. If Gibraltar becomes unusable as a result of French, German or Italianaction from bases in North Africa, it would still be very desirable that we should secure a fuelling base in the Azores, since otherwise we should have no basebetween Freetown and Plymouth. Moreover, if the enemy wrere to establishhimself in either the Cape Verdes or the Azores, our shipping would have to berouted wide to the westward from Freetown, and this would add much to our shipping difficulties and complicate the fuelling problem. On the other hand,if we were to seize these islands at a time when the attitude of Spain and portugal was satisfactory, we might well provoke the hostility of both thesecountries. After careful consideration of the implications of Spanish andPortuguese hostility, we have reached the conclusion that this could only beaccepted if there was an overwhelming case in favour of the seizing of these islands on the grounds of naval and economic warfare. In spite of the undoubtednaval advantages of the occupation of the islands, we do not consider that thereis such a case, and we do not therefore recommend that we should seize them solelybecause Gibraltar becomes unusable as a result of French hostility. We must accept the fact that our control in the Atlantic would be limited to such measureas we could exercise from bases in the United Kingdom and from Freetown.Freetown.21. Our only existing naval base in West Africa is Freetown, which is our most important convoy assembly port overseas. Other possible bases in this area are (a) Takoradi. Not at present a defended anchorage nor does the harbourlend itself to defence from seaward.(b) Bathurst. This is undefended and would be untenable in the event ofan attack from Dakar (120 miles), nor is the harbour suitable for use as a convoy assembly port for navigational reasons.
(c) St. Helena. An open anchorage with limited facilities, which would be quite unsuitable as -a convoy assembly port and is too far from home waters for bunkering.22. Freetown is the only suitable convoy assembly port in the EasternAtlantic between the Cape and Gibraltar. Now that the Mediterranean is closed,the whole of our trade with the East and a large volume of our Australian andNew Zealand trade, as well as all reinforcements and supplies for India, theMiddle East and the Eastern Mediterranean, are routed via the Cape. this route is, therefore, vital.23. It would be possible to thin out the trade on this route to some extent by (i) routeing a larger proportion of the Australian and New Zealand trade via the Pacific and Panama, and (ii) tapping alternative sources of supply in theAmerican continent. Even so, a very large volume of traffic would still have tocome via the Cape and, in case (ii), our dollar exchange would suffer. A propor-tion of the Cape traffic could also be routed via Trinidad as an alternative convoyassembly port to Freetown. This would, however, only be possible in the case ofships with a high endurance, and would considerably increase the distance as wellas escort requirements. It is clear, therefore, that Freetown must be regardedas a link of first importance in our Imperial sea communications, and must beheld and maintained.24. In their West African and Equatorial territories the French have atotal of some 40 battalions, 6 groups of artillery and 56 aircraft of variousobsolete types. The land forces are distributed over a wide area and the majorityof the aircraft are located at Dakar. French air routes connect Dakar withthe other French West African Colonies. Since there are no British air forcesin this area, this small French air force constitutes a threat to the security ofBritish West African possessions, and, in particular, to Freetown. Except forthe limited scale of air attack which could be brought to bear by these few aircraftestablished in West Africa, and apart from Naval raids, however, we do not regard the threat to Freetown as immediate. On the other hand, the use of French air lines of communication in West Africa would, if these were energeticallydeveloped, enable additional enemy air forces to be moved to existing aerodromes in the neighbourhood of Dakar, from which a substantial scale of air attack mightbe developed on Freetown. For maintenance reasons this scale is likely to belimited, unless the enemy can use the sea line of communication to Dakar.Eventually, a further threat might develop on land from surrounding french territory.25. We consider, therefore, that immediate consideration should be givento strengthening the defences of Freetown by (a), the despatch of A.A. guns;(b) the immediate development of accommodation and facilities suitable for white troops;(c) the despatch of troop reinforcements;(d) the improvement of air facilities and the despatch of aircraft as soon asthey can be made available.Other West African Possessions.26. In view of our limited resources and the necessity of concentrating thosewhich can be made available from home on the defence of our essential cornmit-ments abroad, we do not recommend the despatch of any reinforcements else wherein West Africa, although we recognise that we may not be able to hold Bathurstand Takoradi if they are attacked in force. At the same time we consider that every possible step should be taken to press on with the expansion of our west african local forces. Takoradi is being developed as the western terminal ofour air line of communication to the Middle East. We should be prepared toestablish an alternative line from a port in South Africa.Position in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean.27. Apart from the threat to Gibraltar and our West African possessions,the only other British territory or interests which would be directly threatened by French hostility would be Palestine and Egypt.[21496] u
28. We must accept the fact that since the defeat of France our ability to control sea communications in the Western and Central Mediterranean hasbeen much reduced, and may ultimately be confined to sporadic operations bysubmarines. In consequence the Italians have less difficulty in transferringMilitary and Air reinforcements to North Africa. Italy is relieved of all anxietyon the Western Frontier of Libya and Germany is also able to reinforce Libyathrough Italy. The threat to Egypt has, thus, already been very considerably increased as a result of French neutrality, but is not likely to be materiallychanged by French intervention, unless (*) our Eastern Mediterranean fleet shouldsuffer severe damage, or (b) it becomes necessary to defend Palestine againsthostile operations from Syria.The Naval Situation in the Eastern Mediterranean,29, As we have already shown, the balance of naval strength in theMediterranean has now been radically changed to our disadvantage. We see no possibility, however, of reinforcing our Eastern Mediterranean fleet at present,although it must be recognised that the combined French and Italian fleets would,if concentrated, be a numerically superior naval force to our own fleet in theEastern Basin, and that if we cannot maintain the latter in being we may be unable to hold Egypt. We see no reason, however, to change our view that weshould retain our fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean as long as possible. It is,however, improbable that the French fleet will move into the Eastern basin while we retain a capital ship force at Gibraltar.Threat from Syria.30. In the event of Syria becoming actively hostile, the Palestine frontierwill be threatened by the French forces in Syria. These forces consist of3 divisions and 2 weak divisions of local protection troops, together with70 aircraft, including 13 bombers and 20 fighters. Although the attitude ofthese forces has, since the armistice, been divided, the actions at Oran and Dakarare likely to restore their allegiance to Bordeaux. We think it improbable,however, that they would initiate offensive action against us, more particularly inview of the proximity of Turkey and their own internal security problem in Syria.Nor, we think, would they be likely to encourage Italian intervention or offer theItalians facilities in Syria, although this may arise later on. For the present thereis nothing we can do except to strengthen the Palestine frontier within the limits of our present resources in the Middle East, and to watch the Syrian situationcarefully. Should it become necessary to withdraw the fleet from the eastern mediterranean, German and Italian land forces could be transported to Syriaby sea. A very serious situation might then develop to our whole position inthe Middle East.Egypt and the Canal.31. The internal security problem in Egypt is likely to be accentuated bythe very large French communities there. The administration of the Canalmay also become complicated if the French officials cannot be relied upon or have to be replaced.Malta.32. The threat to Malta is increased by the additional French air forces that can be brought to bear from North Africa and the greater naval forces that can be employed in operations against the island. The situation at Malta, whichis constantly under air bombardment, is difficult. The morale of the population is good so far, but must be expected to deteriorate unless defences can be increased.The effect of French hostility will not make a great addition to the scale of attack,though other commitments resulting from French hostility will make it moredifficult than ever to reinforce Malta. In spite of this we consider that the defences of Malta should be increased in view of its importance to the fleet and as a point from which we can strike at Italy by air. It is also an important point in our air communications with the East.
DENIAL OF FRENCH BASES TO THE ENEMY.33. We now turn to consider which French bases we must try to deny to theenemy. In doing so, we can assume that no large scale combined operations willbe possible with our present resources; similarly, no combined operations will be worth while against any French bases which do not constitute a serious threat toour own essential interests.Metropolitan France and North Africa.34. It is clearly out of the question to deny to the enemy the use of Navaland Air bases in Metropolitan France and North Africa, since this would entailmajor operations for which we have not at present the forces available.French West and Equatorial Africa.35. As we have already said, enemy forces operating from Dakar would greatly increase the threat to our sea communications in the Atlantic. In viewof the strength of the garrison in this place, however, we cannot hope to seizeit in the face of French opposition. Our action must, therefore, be limited tothe destruction of the facilities at this port by Naval bombardment or by air attack from aircraft carriers. At the same time, it will be important that weshould prevent the enemy from maintaining his effort on the West African Coastby sea.36. It will be important to the security of our West African Territories,and to the air line of communication from Takoradi to the Sudan, to deny to theenemy as far as possible the use of French air bases in West and equaltorial africa. Fort Lamy in particular would be a serious threat to the air route. If,however, the French became hostile before we had succeeded in destroying these facilities, there is little we could do to deny the use of these bases. We should therefore have to accept the threat to our West African Colonies, defend Freetownas effectively as possible and adopt an alternative air route to the Middle East from South Africa.Madagascar.37. Although there are no French Naval Forces in Madagascar at presentand we think it unlikely that any will be sent there in the near future, we cannotignore the threat to our Indian Ocean trade routes which the presence of a potential raider base at the defended port of Diego Suarez would constitute.38. The French forces in Madagascar consist of three Infantry Regiments(including 2,000 white troops), 2 Brigades of Artillery and 6 obsolete aircraft.Diego Suarez is defended by 6 coastal batteries, including some obsolete 12 - 6-inch guns.39. If the enemy use the island as a base for raiders, it may be necessaryto capture Diego Suarez when the forces become available. We have not beenable to examine the operation in detail, but it is most unlikely that forces could at present be made available. We should, however, be able to exert naval andeconomic pressure, and we might thus be able to avoid recourse to the despatch ofan expedition.West Indies.40. The French West Indian islands are of importance on account of their position flanking our trade routes in the Western Atlantic and to Panama.Fort de France, Martinique, is the most important potential base, and there areat present two French 6-inch cruisers and an aircraft carrier at Martinique andGuadeloupe.41. Available intelligence indicates that the defences of Martinique are mainly obsolete, though there are a number of forts. The garrison is small andconsists of a few companies of native infantry. There is a small naval dockyard,a dry dock 424 feet long, and storage for 25,000 tons of oil fuel. There is noaerodrome.
42. Although the capture of Martinique would not be an operation of any great magnitude, important political considerations are involved. We recommendthat this question should be discussed with the United States of America witha view to Martinique being occupied by American forces, or, failing that, to itsdemilitarisation and neutralisation under American guarantee.The Pacific.43. The Trench Society Islands, Marquesas and other Pacific Islands wouldprovide suitable anchorages for raiders operating against our trade routes in the pacific. There are, however, no facilities of any great value in these islands and,in view of the large number of alternative anchorages which might be used by anocean raider in this area, we do not consider that even the effort involved inseizing the Trench islands would be worth while.Somaliland.44. The forces in French Somaliland consist of 6 battalions of Infantry,2 Groups of Artillery, 3 fighter aircraft and 6 general purpose aircraft. Theirhostility would ensure for the Italians an additional base at Djibouti togetherwith some petrol stocks. This would not materially increase the threat to our communications in the Red Sea. The threat to British Somaliland would,however, be considerably increased and it might become necessary to evacuatethe existing garrison, before any offensive actually developed. General Wavellhas sent a Staff Officer to examine the situation on the spot, and it would be premature to make any recommendation until he (General Wavell) has made afull report.French Indo-China.45. The French Military Forces in Indo-China consist of two to fourInfantry Divisions (mostly native). The air forces include nine fighters, tenbombers, 38 general purpose aircraft. The general effectiveness of the air forces is not bad; although most of the aircraft, except the fighters, are of obsolete type.The Government of Indo-China, whilst adhering to the Bordeaux Government,has hitherto been pro-British, particularly so as their chief fear is Japan, against which country they hope for our support. It is improbable that the repercussions of the Oran operations will materially change this attitude, and no threat need be expected from this French possession.46. Note. In this paper we have appreciated the situation which would arise in the event of full French hostility, both in Metropolitan France and inall French Overseas possessions. This is admittedly the worst possible case which can be assumed, and the gravity of the threat with which we should be faced, particularly at sea and in some of our overseas possessions, is perfectly clear. The French re-actions to the operations at Oran and Dakar, however, arestill somewhat obscure. Although the Bordeaux Government have severedrelations with His Majesty&apos;s Government, there is still some reason to hope thatparts of the French Empire will remain loyal to the British cause. Clearly, our immediate aim must be to foster such support to the best of our ability.
