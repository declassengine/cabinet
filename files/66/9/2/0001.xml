OABIggT.IMMEDIATE MEASURES R^OJLTRE^IH THE PAR EAST.Report Ly.Jh^Ohigfs of St^ff Coinuittee.In the light of recent developments in Tokyo, and&quot;pending the--completion of a full appreciation, we submit thefoiioijrlng conclusions and recommendations which are based on   .preliminary work we have already carried out in an examinationof our strategy in the Par East in the new situation.(a) The strategic importance of our position in the far East remains as great as ever, particularlyin yiew of our dependence Upon the economicweapon to defeat Germany,(b) The principal counters to Japanese aggression aretheU.S.A.  and Russia,  and Japan&apos;s large military commitment in China,      Our policy should be to induce U0S.A0  to declare her vital interest inthe status quo in the Par East.      We should alsoencourage Russia and the U.S.A.   to lend all theassistance in their power to Chiang Kai Shek,(c) We cannot spare a fleet for the Par East atpresent.      It xs all the more important,therefore,  that we should do what we can toimprove our land and air defences in Malaya sothat at the worst we retain a foothold in thearea.      The provision of equipped&quot;troops fromthe United Kingdom would take time and would prejudice Home Defence.      Provision from theMiddle piast is,  in our view, impossible if weare to/maintain our position in that theatre.The only other sources are India and Australia,(d) India could make one brigade available now and increase this force to one division in September, -These troops are at present earmarked for service in/Iraq. 03? Iran.      The situation in the MiddleEatst may develop rapidly and Indian troops arenpt only closer to that scene of action, but/Oetter adapted than Australians for sewice in&apos;most parts of Africa,

m9(e) Australia hap indientedP ttwfr fartheroontinf^nts will be ready to sail as follows&quot;6 fOOO men by  mid-July, a further34,000 men by the end of August, in additionxc 2 Squadrons of aircraft.We recommend that the Australian Governmentshould be requested to send one division and 2 Squadrons (in addition to the onenow being sent) to Malaya as soon aspossible and we attach a draft telegram to that effect for approval.     In thattelegram it v/ill be seen that we areasking particularly for one of the HomeDefence Militia divisions to be madeavailable, since they alone are equipped.Should this request be met, it will benecessary to arrange for additional reserves of food and ammunition for the Malayagarrison at an early date.(f) To show a firm front to Japan we should retainI, I      at present both our battalions at ShanghaisShould however the U.S.A. prove willing totake over the policing of the British section  I    of the International Settlement the question\   of the withdrawal of these units should be-  reviewed.(g) We should retain our present garrison at HongKong to fight it out if war comes.      Thepresence of large numbers of British women and children at Hong Kong would be a serious embarrassment and since evacuation might notbe possible in the event of a sudden Japaneseattack we recommend that they should be movednow,  either to the Philippine Islands or toAustralia.     We do not think that theJapanese would interpret this step as a sign of weakness, rather the reverse.(h) We recommend that authority be accorded now tothe Governor of Malaya to institute thenecessary measures to bring the Malayandefences up to a state of readiness, whichwill enable them, to be fully effective within five days warning.      We submit a draft telegram at Annex II.(Signed) C.L.N.  NEWALL.JOHN DILL.T.S.V.  PHILIPPS, V.C.N.&amp;.Cabinet War Room.     Commonwealth telegram No. 280 of 12th June.25TH JUNE, 1940.

ANNEX I.DRAFT.; TELE GRAM-.To:-    Government of Australia.Copy to Government of New Zealand(for information)o1. In spite of the deterrent effect of Japan&apos;military commitments  in China., the possible hostility of thetfnx-t^oT^S-fra-tes of ^America and Russia and our military andeconomic st&quot;reng-oh9 there are indications that Japan may hecontemplating moves to improve her strategic and economicposition0      While it is not thought that war with Japan is necessarily imminents the Chiefs of Staff are reviewing far east strategy.      Their views are briefly as follows:-2o Security of our Imperial interests in Par East liesultimately in our ability to control sea communications inSouth &quot;Western Pacific for which purpose adequate fleet mustbe based at Singapore.      We appreciate your anxiety in respectof the despatch of a Fleet to Singapore.      Since our previousassurances in this respect3 however  the -whole strategicsituation has been radically altered by the French defeat,,Naval di-sp-c-si-ii-ons are now dependent on retaining in Europeanwaters sufficient Naval forces to match both German andItalian FleetSo      In present -cipcums-taaoes s therefore 9 wecannot send a Fleet to the Par East.3o Meantime strategic importance to us of Far East both for Empire security and to enable us to defeat enemy bycontrol of essential commodities at  source has increased.4c Japanese advance in China and Hainan has increasedthreat to Malaya and any further advance into French Indo-China, Dutch passassions or Thailand would endanger stillmore our--position at&apos;&quot;Singapore which is the key point inPar East.      Owing to increased range of aircraft anddevelopment of aerodromess particularly in Thailands we cannot longer concentrate on d.defence of Singapore Island alonebut must consider defence of Malaya as a wholes particularlysecurity of up-country landing grounds.      For this reasonand because we cannot spare a fleet for the Far East atpresent9  it is all the more important that we should do what we can to improve our land and air defences in MalayaQ5o In your telegram No.  290 of 13th June you   mention the possibility of supplying further land forces.      TheChiefs of Staff consider that the urgent move of one division and two Squadrons    aircraft to Malaya is desirableas an added immediate deterrent.,      They ask particularlywhether one Division equipped as fully as possibles  couldbe made availables drawing if necessary on your militia pool of equipment.,      They consider that employment in Malaya would for the time being at any rate be in best interests of theEmpire.6&quot; If owing to equipment or other difficulties you cannot make a whole division immediately available,,  Chiefs of Staffrecommend move by brigade groups as they become ready.-o-

ANNEX IIoDraft Telegram..To:-     Governor? Straits Settlements and Malaya.Chiefs of Staff have been considering Par Eastsituation and on their recommendation Cabinet have decidedthat our defences in Malaya should be placed and maintained^in a state which will enable them to be fully effectivewithin five days&apos; warning.      You may now take all actionyou consider necessary for defence without further reference to me0     This does not imply that a Japaneseattack is imminent, but there are sufficient indications of Japanese intention to improve her strategic and economic position to justify us in taking full emergency mea ures.Australia has been asked to provide one division and two further squadrons airorafx for service in.Malaya at avery early date-4-
