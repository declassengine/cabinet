naval SITUATION.General Review.THE outstanding event in the Naval Situation during the past week hasbeen the action taken to prevent the French Fleet falling into enemy hands.At least 4 Italian submarines and one destroyer have been sunk in theMediterranean.There has been a considerable reduction in the number of German U-boatson patrol.French Fleet.2. The French failure to comply with their undertaking to prevent theirfleet falling into the hands of our enemies as a result of the armistice necessitatedaction by us to that end on the 3rd July, on which, date the disposition of theprincipal French naval forces was as shown in Appendix IV.All vessels in British ports were seized. At Plymouth the seizure was effected without incident except for the submarine Surcouf, where 2 british officers were seriously wounded and 1 rating killed and 1 wounded. One Frenchofficer was also killed and 1 wounded. At Portsmouth a leaflet raid was carriedout on the French ships for the crews&apos; information and the ships successfullyseized.At Alexandria the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, concluded anagreement with the French Admiral for discharge of oil fuel and the removal ofthe ships&apos; companies.3. At Oran the French Admiral refused to comply with the conditions that were presented to him by Captain Holland, late Naval Attache in Paris, at-30 a.m. on the 3rd July, and a British force, including 3 capital ships,2 cruisers and 1 aircraft carrier, had finally to open lire on the French ships inthe port at about 6 p.m.The French ships and forts replied and the battle-cruiser Dunkerque put to sea and was chased, but escaped to the eastward. Subsequently she was attacked by torpedo planes and one hit obtained. Air reconnaissance showed that the battle-cruiser Strasbourg was hit and beached. One battleship sunk andone battleship hit, an aircraft carrier set on fire and 2 destroyers sunk. Theaircraft carrier was subsequently seen at sea proceeding eastwards.The British casualties were One officer and one rating slightly wounded andmaterial damage negligible.Three Swordfish and 2 Skua aircraft were lost, but only one crew notrecovered.4. At Algiers, 9 French cruisers and 1 destroyer are reported to have sailedat 1715/3rd July for an unknown destination.H.M.S. Velox was fired on by a shore battery off Casablanca while on patrol.Dakar and Martinique are being watched by H.M. ships to prevent any ofthe French ships leaving.Home Waters.5. During the week under review there have been signs that preparationsare being made in Norway and Flanders for the launching of a seaborneexpedition.The F.A.A. carried out an attack on a concentration of barges in the Maasnear Rotterdam, but the result was not seen owing to thick cloud.Enemy E. Boats have been active in the Channel, the armed trawler Wellandwas attacked and missed by 4 torpedoes and the s.s. Helder reports sinking an E.Boat.H.M.S. Greyhound and M.T.Bs. chased and engaged E. Boats off Dover on the27th June, and M.T.Bs. carried out sweeps to the mouths of the Maas andScheldt rivers on two occasions.Enemy aircraft also were active in the Channel during the week. H.M.S.Hesperus and a convoy were attacked on the 1st July, the s.s. Aeneas was bombed and set on fire on the 2nd July and some ships and convoys were attacked on the3rd July.
Portland naval base was attacked by 3 aircraft on the 30th June with little damage. On the 4th July over 20 aircraft again attacked, H.M.S. Foylebank, anA.A. ship, being sunk with 50 seriously wounded. The S.S. City of Melbourne(6,630 tons) was also hit and beached, and a tug sunk.The German battle cruiser Scharnhorst in the floating dock at Kiel was attacked by the R.A.F. on night of the lst-2nd July, and hits obtained on bothship and dock (see also Air Situation).Northern Waters,6. Convoys of enemy merchant ships, escorted by destroyers, were observed by our aircraft proceeding northwards off the Norwegian coast on two occasions,and attacked with bombs.On the 30th June H.M. Submarine Severn attacked an enemy destroyerwithout success and on the 3rd July ELM. Submarine Snapper made 3 possiblehits on a south-bound convoy.F.A.A. aircraft attacked and damaged, a hangar and slipway at Stono nearBergen on the 3rd July.Atlantic.The S.S. Arandora Star was torpedoed and sunk on the 2nd July,N.W. of Ireland, whilst carrying German and Italian internees and prisoners ofwar under an armed guard to Canada. H.M. Canadian destroyer St. Laurentlanded 868 survivors at Greenock, of whom 119 were crew, 163 out of 200 officersand men of the armed guard. She also landed 264 Italians and. 322 Germansout of a total of 1,300 internees and prisoners of war.Mediterranean.7. On the 28th June, as a result of a reconnaissance by a Sunder!and flyingboat, the 7th Cruiser Squadron sighted and. engaged at long range 3 Italiandestroyers. The Espero was sunk, and others escaped at high speed in the fallingdarkness.ELM. Submarine Orpheus is overdue and must be presumed lost. TheCommander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, considers the recent losses of our submarinesis probably due to extensive defensive minelaying by the Italians.On the 26th June the S.S. Baron Erskine was shelled off the Algerian Coastby an Italian submarine. She replied with gunfire and claims to have madeone hit.Anti-Submarine Operations.8. There were 6 attacks on U-boats in Home Waters, 3 of which were by aircraft. H.M.S. Rochester, in co-operation with a Sunderland flying boat, sankU. 26 on the 1st July in the &quot;Western Approaches. The crew were rescued. the armed yacht White Bear and H.M.S. Vansittart also made promising attacks.In the Mediterranean 7 attacks were made, 3 of which were by aircraft.On the 28th June a Sunderland flying boat attacked an Italian submarine 20 miles south of Corfu and claims 2 hits with 250-lb. bombs. Subsequently this flying-boat attacked and sank the Rubino on the 29th June and rescued 4 survivors.Five destroyers of the Mediterranean Fleet on the 27th and 29th sank3 Italian submarines the Luizzi. Scebelli and Salpa. There was 95 survivorsfrom the first two.The submarine Balilla was also attacked by ELM.A. Ships Stuart andVoyager, and H.M.S. Decoy, but succeeded in reaching port, though badly damaged.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.9. Eight British ships, totalling 67,587 tons, and six ships of other nations,totalling 24,963 tons, have been sunk by enemy submarines.No ships have been reported sunk due to mines, but one British ship theS.S. JEneas of 10,058 tons was twice bombed and finally set on fire and abandoned and is reported not worth salving.The total loss for the week is therefore 102,608 tons. Full details are shownin Appendix I.[21486] B
Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. A total of 892 ships, including 112 Allied and 49 neutral ships, were convoyed during the week. Three ships in one convoy from Sierra Leone were attacked and two of them were sunk. One, the s.s. Clan Ogilvy, is still afloat andproceeding to the United Kingdom.Two ships in an outward bound unescorted convoy were also attacked, but are reported still afloat.Eleven armed merchant cruisers, twenty-five destroyers, twenty-seven sloopsand corvettes were employed on escort duties.Since the commencement of hostilities 21,908 British, 2,013 Allied and 3,326neutral ships, a total of 27,247 ships, have been convoyed.Thirty-four British, three Allied and three neutral ships, a total of forty,have been lost.   The British loss ratio is 1 in 644.11. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 29th June totalled 1,085,026 tons, compared with 959,498 tons duringthe previous week. Twenty-three tankers brought 264,663 tons of oil, an increaseof 45,017 tons. Mineral imports were 214,228 tons, a decrease of 40,309 tons onthe exceptionally large imports of the week ending the 22nd June. cereal imports, which have been exceptionally large during recent weeks, totalled208,181 tons, an increase of 12,605 tons. Other food imports amounted to142,362 tons, of which 79,046 tons were sugar and molasses, 23,173 tons wererefrigerated or tinned meat and 5,762 were fruit.Enemy Naval Intelligence.German.12. Information as to the positions of the Main German surface units is derived entirely from air reconnaissances carried out on the 29th June and onthe 3rd July.   These showed : A t Kiel 1 battle cruiser, probably Scharnhorst, in the floating dock.Pocket battleship Lutzow in dock with damaged stern.1 aircraft carrier.1 Hipper class cruiser.1 Koln class cruiser.A t Wilhelmshaven Battleship Tirpitz andPocket battleship Admiral Scheer in the Bauhafen.At Trondheim-1 Hipper class cruiser (8-inch).1 other warship.1 battle cruiser, probably Gneisnau, which was last seen at Trondheim onthe 23rd June, the cruisers Nurnberg, Leipzig and Emden and the old battleshipsSchlesien and Schleswig-Holstein are unlocated, though it may be that Emdenis under repair in a German port and that Nurnberg, which is believed to havebeen damaged, is the unidentified warship at Trondheim.13. The chief activity of German submarines in the period under reviewhas been first in an area some 150-200 miles S.W. of Ireland, where three ships were torpedoed between 27th June and 29th June, and then further to the south,where attacks were made on ships in convoy on 30th June. The number of submarines at work seems to show a steady decline from the 27th June to the2nd July, at the beginning of the period 11 were located and only 6 at the end.On the earlier date there seem to have been six at work in the western approaches. Bay of Biscay and Spanish-Portuguese Coast Area, extending their operations as far south as Cape St. Vincent, though the possibility of an Italian
submarine cannot be ignored in this last instance. A general movement to thenorth seems then to have begun at that time and by the 2nd July only three orfour submarines seem to have been remaining in the Western Approaches-Finisterre area. The submarines located to the north of Ireland and still further north appear for the present to be mostly on passage out or home.Italian.14. It is possible that the reconstructed battleship Duilio is now completed and in commission; with the others she is now probably based on Taranto. Airreconnaissances on the 30th June and the 1st July indicated three 8-inch cruisers and four 6-inch cruisers distributed between Messina and Augusta and on the1st July another air reconnaissance reported two destroyers at Bardia and threeare known to be at Benghazi. It seems probable that the three destroyersattacked by the 7th Cruiser Squadron on the 28th June were based on Libyanports.Except for the three surviving submarines in the Red Sea, it seems probablethat Italian submarine activity is still confined to the Mediterranean.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.15. Up to noon, the 26th June, 68 German merchant ships, totalling 382,548tons, were known to have been sunk or scuttled, 58, totalling 259,122 tons, hadbeen captured or seized, and 41 unidentified ships of 20,500 tons had been reportedsunk by submarines and aircraft. The total number of merchant ships lost toGermany was therefore 167 ships of 486,670 tons.It is reported from Sweden that the Koln (7,881 tons) with a cargo of swedish ore for Germany stranded on the Argus Bank north of Orksars onthe night of the 26th-27th June. The crew has been landed and attempts atsalvage have been abandoned.A large German tanker is reported to have arrived at Tallinn in May andto have sailed for Kiel on the 27th June with 10,500 tons of heavy Estonian oil.One merchantman of between 2,000 and 3,000 tons, and another of less than,000 tons were alongside at Narvik on the 29th June.Five ships at Vigo and another at Ferrol were reported on the 27th june to be showing considerable activity. Two of them were rumoured to be goingto sail.The Havelland (6,334 tons) left Manzanillo, in Mexico, where she had beensince the end of October, on the 27th June.The Helgoland (3,664 tons), at Puerto Colombia, having been repaired by italian labour, is reported to be raising steam.Two ships, the Rhakotis (6,753 tons) and the Hermonthis (4,833 tons), in aChilean and a Peruvian port respectively, were disposing of their cargoes of timber early in June.Italian.16. The five Italian merchant ships which were captured and sent to Methilon the 10th June have now passed into British ownership.The Cape Olmo (4,781 tons) has arrived at Gibraltar from Marseilles, where she had been seized by the French.The Italians are arranging for the repatriation of part of the crews oftwo ships in Bandarshapur. The men will go overland via Istanbul and Trieste,and the arrangements are likely to take a month to complete.The owners of the Conte Biancamano (23,255 tons), which is now at Colon,have instructed the agents to unload her and store the goods. It has beenreported that 60,000 out of the 380,000 dollars required for her release havebeen deposited.On the 24th June it was reported from Buenos Aires that the Capo Rosa(4,699 tons) was to be arrested the following day by the suppliers of her cargo of naphtha.Four Italian tankers at Teneriffe loaded 1,297 tons of oil from the Americantanker Dungannon between the 24th June and the 27th June.[21486] B 2
Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.Home Waters.17. During the week the 26th June to the 3rd July the ports of Blyth,Aberdeen, the Tyne, Harwich. Weymouth and Portland have each been closedonce during the week by mines laid by enemy aircraft, but never for more thana day. Wick has twice been closed. Mines have also been suspected in the bristol Channel and off the coast and ports between Wick and Devonport. TheTees, Hartlepool and Sunderland wrere closed on the 25th June, as recorded in last week&apos;s report, the two latter being reopened the following day. The Teeswas closed for two days, as two mines were swept off Hartlepool, in consequenceof which a further search was considered necessary. These two mines wereexploded by horizontal Magnet Sweeps, known as the &quot; Mauve Sweep.&quot; Harwichwas mined and closed on the morning of the 3rd July.As far as is known at present, no casualties due to mines have occurred during the past week.18. LL Sweeps have exploded 13 mines during the week, of which 4 havebeen off Portsmouth, 3 off Portland, 2 off the Tyne, 2 in the Downs, and 2 in the humber area.  This brings the LL total up to 157.Skids have exploded 2 more mines in the Lowestoft approaches, and 1 offthe Humber, bringing the Skid total to 52.In addition to the 2 mines exploded by the Mauve Sweep mentioned above,another type of M sweep exploded 1 mine inside Coquet Island off Amble. TheM Sweep total is now 32.The total number of magnetic mines dealt with to the 3rd July was 307.19. A contact mine was cut on the 30th June in the Flamborough Headarea.   426 contact mines have been dealt with altogether.On the 1st July an enemy submarine was reported by aircraft in the NorthChannel between the Mull of Kintyre and the Irish Coast. Six objects belowthe surface resembling mines were reported near the position where thesubmarine had last been seen. Ships have been warned to avoid this area. The57th Minesweeping Group are to sweep this area on their way to carry out a thorough search of the dangerous area, to the north of Ireland.A mine, complete with parachute, has been recovered from the Humber.M mediterranean.20. It is reported that the Italians have twenty-five submarines which can carry between 10 and 24 mines and one submarine which can carry 40. Tensubmarines are nearing completion which may carry mines of an as yet unknownnumber.Indian Ocean.21. It was reported last week that Bombay had been closed owing to asuspected minefield. As far as is known, the port is still closed, though it is now considered possible that the vessel sunk was torpedoed.British Minelaying.22. Two important additions to the East Coast barrier were laid in thecurrent week; 502 mines laid on the 29th June and 468 on the 2nd July byH.M.S. Teviot Bank, Plover, Express, Intrepid and Icarus. Minelaying by aircraft has continued.Economic Warfare.23. During the fortnight ending the 29th June, 28,383 tons of cargo wereseized in prize, the main item being 27,795 tons of petroleum and allied products.U.S.S.R.24. All the heavy units.of the Baltic Fleet, including the two battleshipsMarat and Octyabrskaya Revolutsiya, heavy cruisers Kirov and Maxim Gorki,destroyers,   small  transports   and  considerable  submarine  forces,   are   now
concentrated at Tallinn, in Estonia. A 7,000 ton troop transport arrived on the evening of the 3rd July.Two submarines, believed to be Russian, have been stopping shipping to the southward of the Aaland Islands.Preparation for the Immobilisation of Ports.25. The immobilisation of Ports consists of measures such as sinkingemergency blockships, laying observation mines, fitting up torpedo tubes, cutting-power off&apos; cranes, &amp;c.At the end of May orders were issued to the Flag Officers concerned toprepare schemes for immobilising ports between Aberdeen and Swanage. Theschemes for these ports are well advanced, and except for some ports where theblockships and the observation mines are not ready it may be said that if theorder to immobilise is given the schemes will be fully carried out.In the middle of June orders were given to prepare schemes for immobilisa-tion of certain ports in Northern Ireland, and these are proceeding satisfactoi*ily.In the middle of June also orders were given to prepare schemes for portsfrom Swanage to Land&apos;s End.   These schemes are also proceeding satisfactorily.Finally, at the end of June orders were given to prepare schemes forimmobilisation for ports from Land&apos;s End to Holyhead.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.Germany.26. German forces have occupied the Channel Islands. The number oftroops in Norway, including parachute troops, has been increased and shipping in Norwegian ports is now sufficient for the transport of two divisions. Inaddition there are some hundreds of smaller craft. A naval covering force and airprotection are available.There is little information from Germany and the Baltic save for thepresence at Kiel of shipping loaded with some form of pontoon and reports oftraining activity around Baltic islands.A regrouping and re-organisation of the German Air Force in France andBelgium appears to be in progress, and there is a report of parachute regimentsand special air landing troops being moved from Austria and Berlin to Belgium.A report has been received that aircraft designed to carry small tanks arebeing made at Fallersleben (near Brunswick) and that a number of such aircraft have been completed. Fallersleben is the town near which the factory to buildthe &quot;People&apos;s Car &quot; was erected. The factory may, therefore, have been adapted for mass production of aircraft.27. According to a report received on the 28th June Norwegian resistance in the occupied areas has not yet been broken. It is stated that German soldiershave been killed after dark, forests have been fired, and recently some barracksoutside Oslo were burnt. The Germans are reported to be threatening reprisalson the civil population if these activities continue.Iceland.28. H.Q. 49th Division and the 146th Infantry Brigade arrived in Icelandon the 26th June and Major-General Curtis took over command on the 27th.Mediterranean and Middle East.Dodecanese.29. There is evidence that further reinforcements reached Rhodes duringthe week preceding the entry of Italy into the war, as a result of which themilitary garrison in the Dodecanese may have risen to between 45,000 and 50,000.This figure represents the equivalent of three divisions plus non-divisional troops and services.
Egypt and Libya.30. The Italians have re-occupied Sidi Aziz and Fort Capuzzo on the libyan border and have held them in the face of attacks by the 4th armoured brigade supported by aircraft. These points are now held in considerably greaterstrength than at the outbreak of hostilities. The Italian force at Bir El Cobihas also been strengthened and is protected by wire.Italian G.H.Q. has been transferred to Cirenaica, but no movements of troops from Western to Eastern Libya have been reported.Palestine. ]31.   The following Allied troops had arrived from Syria on the 1st July : Officers.        O.R.SPolish    ............      410 2,745French    .........       ... 6 103Czechs    ............... 206Sudan.32. An Italian concentration near the Red Sea coast on the road to PortSudan was reported, but ground reconnaissance has revealed no enemy inSudanese territory in this area. A minor operation on the frontier near Gallabat,in which a small Sudan Defence Force unit was engaged with an Italian Colonialbattalion, resulted in some thirty enemy casualties with the loss of one Sudanesekilled and ten wounded. The enemy fought with greater determination than before.East Africa and Somaliland.33. There have been minor operations at Moyale on the northern frontier.There are indications of a more serious Italian attack impending on this front.Reconnaissances on the Garissa front have reported no enemy located up to34 miles from the Kenya border. Two brigades of the Royal West AfricanFrontier Force have arrived and are being moved up-country from Mombassa.34. In Somaliland the 1/2 Punjab Regiment has arrived from Aden,bringing the total British forces to two battalions and the Somaliland CamelCorps. The 2nd Battalion, King&apos;s African Rifles, and 1st East African LightBattery left Mombassa for Berbera on the 2nd and 3rd July respectively.There has been minor operations near Buramo, on the Italian border, whichis strongly held by Italian regular troops and levies supported by A.F.V&apos;s. Thereare no indications yet of an attack on the French Somaliland front.Balkan States, Hungary and Turkey.35. On the 26th June the Soviet Government delivered an ultimatum to roumania demanding the surrender of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. Thedemands were accepted by the Roumanian Government and by midnight on thelst/2nd July Soviet troops had advanced to the new frontier running from the source of the River Suceava to Dornesti, thence through Siret and Herta andalong the River Pruth to its junction with the Danube which it follows to Valcov.The withdrawal of Roumanian troops from Bessarabia and northern Bukovina was accompanied by some disorder, caused partly by the speed of the Soviet advance,but chiefly by Jews and Communists. At Reni and Ismail the landing of Sovietparachute troops for the purpose of preventing evacuation added to the confusion.The withdrawal, however, was not a complete rout and in many cases local commanders organised a determined resistance. Anti-Jewish and anti-british feeling is very strong and German propaganda has been quick to present theRussian action as being due to British influence. It is reported that the army is disgusted at having to withdraw without fighting and that there is consequentlystrong feeling against the King in Army circles. The desire to fight, however,does not appear to have been general throughout the Army, for it is reportedthat a large number of troops have deserted or preferred to remain in their homes in Bessarabia.36. Civil mobilisation has been proclaimed in Bulgaria, and this will makemilitary mobilisation easier to carry out, should it be decided on. Officialutterances emphasising Bulgaria&apos;s intention not to take advantage of Roumania&apos;s
present discomfiture are thought to be sincere, since there are only two divisionsimmediately available for an attack on the Dobruja. There have, however,been two clashes with Roumanian troops on the Dobrujan frontier, and reports have been received which point to the likelihood of minor reinforcements arriving in north-eastern Bulgaria.37. The Hungarian General Staff, whilst denying that mobilisation is general, admit that the Hungarian troops on the Roumanian frontier have been further reinforced, and that the frontier guard units are now all in position.They have also made it clear that internal trouble in Roumania might be used by Hungary as an excuse for intervention on the pretext of protecting the hungarian minority in Transylvania. It is, however, doubtful whether Hungarywould take this extreme step without the connivance of Germany.38. Turkish army mobilisation continues and is expected to be completed by the 10th July, 1940. The principal concentration of troops is in Thrace, whereit is anticipated that the number of formations will be increased to fourteeninfantry divisions, one cavalry division and an armoured brigade.39. It is not known whether any further military measures have been takenin Greece, but assurances have been received that the Greeks will withstandaggression by Italy, and there is reason to believe that the Cretans will resistinvasion with every means at their disposal.Reports indicate that the Italian garrison in Albania has been furtherreinforced and is now about 110,000 men.40. The number of men with the colours in Yugoslavia is, for purposes of economy, being kept at about 500,000. The policy adopted, however, permits of rapid expansion. It is officially stated that within a few days the strength ofthe army could be raised to 800,000, that is, sufficient for a field army of twenty-four infantry divisions and three cavalry divisions. The policy, however, is tocall up in the first instance only the most reliable and martial elements of thepopulation, namely, the Serbs and Bosnians.U.S.S.R.41. A reliable report states that a number of cavalry divisions stationed inthe Kiev Military District have been partially motorised. It seems, therefore,that the Soviet authorities have been deeply impressed with the value of mobiletroops and are taking steps to model their forces on the German pattern.Baltic States and Finland.42. While the possibility of Soviet action against Finland cannot be excluded, recent reports of probable aggression in this quarter are discountedto some extent by Soviet troop movements and new commitments in the baltic states and Bessarabia. Nevertheless, the concentration of the Soviet Baltic fleet at Tallinn is an indication of possible Soviet intentions in regard to the AalandIslands.Far East.43. The Japanese are meeting with increasing resistance in their operations on the Indo-China border, and are unlikely to make much further progress until they are reinforced.The only troops immediately available for this purpose are one division now operating in the Hong Kong area, and it is possible that, once the Japanese aresatisfied that the arms traffic across the Hong Kong frontier has been satisfactorily stopped, the majority of this division may be moved to theIndo-China front. Unfortunately for the Japanese this plan may be interfered with by the presence in the East River district of four regular Chinese divisions,who are putting up more resistance than was expected.These delays in the prosecution of their drive against China&apos;s arms suppliesmay have a bad effect in Japan, where the pro-German element which favoursdirect action against Indo-China is reliably stated to be in a position to dictatethe policy of the fighting services.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.45. Our bombing attacks have continued on similar lines to those of lastweek, with the same object. The Scharnhorst has been attacked in the floating dock at Kiel. The German Air Force operating from Norway, N.W. Germanyand France, has continued sporadic night attacks on a moderate scale, and havemade their first series of daylight raids since the 10th May, assisted by cloudswhich hampered our fighters. Our fighters have operated in force overthe French coast both on offensive patrol and bomber escort duties, but combatshave not been frequent. Coastal Command has maintained constant anti-invasionpatrols and searches for enemy warships, in the face of considerable opposition,and attacks have been carried out on enemy surface vessels. Two submarineshave been destroyed by aircraft, one in co-operation with a naval unit. Opera-tions in the Middle East continue on similar lines to last week.Great Britain.46.   Enemy air attacks on this country have been maintained on the previousscale and daylight raids have been resumed, but little substantial result has soU     /vuLjtgvfc    far been achieved.  Sporadic attacksLhave been so widely scattered over England,Scotland and Wales that it is hard to say with certainty what the primary^cnw*. tcrt-cuJ^ objectives other than aerodromesLhave been.   There are indications that pilotsjfenicx *^*Xv*x&amp; find, extreme difficulty in locating their targets at night.   For instance, on the28th/29th June the Germans believed that they&apos;had successfully bombed PlymouthHarbour, when actually the nearest bombs fell 12 to 15 miles to the east of it.Enemy minelaying took place on most nights throughout the week.47. Day activities during the early part of the week consisted mainly ofmeteorological and reconnaissance flights except for a raid on Jersey andGuernsey on the 28th June, in the course of which 26 civilians were killed andmany injured. On the same day reconnaissance flights extended to the west ofIreland. There was a light raid on Portland on the 30th June, but on the 1st Julydaylight attacks became more extensive and some damage was done to oil tanksat Hull, and on the following day damage was caused at Newcastle and Jarrow.On the 3rd July extensive operations were carried out over East Anglia andSouth-East England, about 25 aircraft being engaged. The former did notpenetrate deeply, but the latter covered a wide area in Kent, Sussex and Surrey.Attacks were very scattered and, except for the destruction of seven trainingaircraft, little damage was done, though a number of aerodromes were attacked.On the morning of the 4th July a more serious attack was made on Portland, as reported in the Naval Section, and a single aircraft attacked the Bristol area and was subsequently shot down by fighters. The night raids are summarised in Appendix V. At least 71 civilians were killed and 280 injured during theweek.48. Fighter Command flew 642 patrols, involving 1,447 sorties, over thiscountry during the week. Seven enemy aircraft were destroyed, with a furtherfour unconfirmed.At Tientsin the Japanese military authorities have removed the restrictionson entry to the Concessions, which are rapidly returning to normal conditions.At Shanghai the situation remains normal, and no particular difficulties have yet arisen out of the occupation by Japanese troops of the part of the extra-settlement area which was evacuated by the French on the 25th June.44.   The evacuation of women and children from Hong Kong which wasordered on 27/6/40 is proceeding according to plan.Those evacuated to date are : 1,052 Service families to Manila 1/7/40.All Indian families to India on 2/7/40.
Attacks on Germany and German-Occupied Territory.49. Day and night attacks by Bomber Command have been maintained atthe previous intensity, again with the primary object of reducing the scale of air attack on this country. Particulars are given in Appendix VI, which includesfurther extracts from Raid Assessment Reports.50. The day sorties have been directed mainly against aerodromes in occupied territory and objectives in North-Eastern Germany; they have also beenemployed for photographic reconnaissance in force. They have been plannedprincipally to operate under cover of cloud, and there have as- a result beenoccasions when it was not possible for all the bombers to reach their objectives;results have, however, been in general satisfactory. Some fighter escorts havebeen used.51. Night operations were somewhat hampered by weather conditionstoward the end of the week, but the total number of sorties was about the sameas during the previous week. The most notable operation was the raid on theSchamhorst at Kiel, carried out by five Whitleys and eleven Hampdens on the night of the lst-2nd July. Weather conditions were ideal, and complete surpriseappears to have been achieved The bombs dropped by the first aircraft started L,^yfive large fires which provided illumination for the rest. Direct hits were seen x^L^-^^m^on the ship with one 2,000-lb. bomb and with 500-lb. and 250-lb. bombs, and oilfires were started which were visible eighty miles away. Daylight reconnaissanceon the 3rd July largely confirmed these reports. Photographs appear to show thathits were obtained on the starboard side of the ship, and on both sides of the floating dock. The whole harbour area for a distance of eight miles from thesouth end is covered with oil.52.   During the week, 168 day and 552 night sorties were flown; six aircraft were lost in the former and seven in the latter.North Sea and Coastal.53. Reconnaissances and offensive patrols to the Norwegian, Danish,German, Dutch and Belgian coasts have continued throug-hout the week and enemy fighters have been frequently encountered. As reported in the Naval Section,the movements of German naval units were reported, and a number of attacks on shipping carried out. A very successful photographic reconnaissance, madeof Kiel Harbour on the 29th June, disclosed scharnhorst lying in a floating dock and other units of the German fleet in the harbour. Fighter operations over theFrench coast have been maintained.54. On the 27th June the seaplane bases at Texel and Den Helder were bombed by two Hudsons. Willemsoord was attacked on two occasions, on the28th, when there occurred an explosion as if from an ammunition store, and onthe 29th, when the gasworks were severely damaged. De Kooy aerodrome was bombed on the 1st July, and on the 3rd July a factory at Ijmuiden and thehangars at Texel were successfully attacked, and a Me. 109 was shot down inflames. Aalborg harbour, in Denmark, was reconnoitred on the 2nd July; bombs were aimed at two large merchant ships and at aircraft on an aerodrome near by,,but results were not observed. The canals of Flanders have been bombed on several occasions. Gn the 29th June it is thought that a large barge was sunk in the entrance to the canal at Ostend. On the night of the lst-2nd July an attack wasmade by eighteen Swordfish on river traffic in the Maas, and it is believed that considerable damage was done.55. As described in the Naval Section, one submarine, the TJ-26, was sunk by a Sunderland in the Western Approaches on the 1st July, in co-operationwith naval forces. Excluding the Mediterranean, there have been two otherpromising attacks, one off the North of Scotland on the 27th June, the other offBelfast on the 1st July; direct hits were observed in both cases.56. A Sunderland arrived on the scene shortly after the sinking of theArandora Star on the 2nd July, and was instrumental inj^the rescue of the survivors. X^xiaXOv^[21486] - c
57. Extensive minelaying by aircraft of both Coastal and BomberCommands has continued during the week. &amp;ft4 Twelve aircraft have been lostduring theselpperations.58. Fighter Command flew 42 patrols, involving 395 sorties, over theFrench Coast during the week. Eight enemy aircraft were destroyed, with afurther ten unconfirmed, and we suffered seven casualties. German standing-fighter patrols between Calais and Boulogne are being strengthened, evidentlyto interfere with reconnaissance.Middle East.Egypt.59. On the 27th and 28th June heavy enemy attacks were made on the aerodromes at Sidi Barran&amp;i and Mersa Matrub, with more than usualdetermination. Mersa Matruh was rendered temporarily unserviceable. Apartfrom these attacks enemy activity was not great. It is now established that two enemy aircraft were brought down by anti-aircraft fire during the attack on SidiAzeiz on the 26th June and five by our fighters on the 29th June.60. Our bombers successfully attacked Bir-El-Gubbi on the 28th and29th June. Direct hits were registered on aircraft on the ground, as well as onthe camp and petrol storage. On the 30th June two further enemy aircraft were shot down by fighters at Sidi Azeiz. A reconnaissance on the 29th June disclosedthe presence of two hostile destroyers at Bardia.Sudan.61. Acico was attacked by Wellesleys on the 26th June and again on the29th June, the principal target being the fuel installation plant. A successful operation against the aerodrome at Gura was also carried out on the 26th June.Enemy losses were one aircraft confirmed and one unconfirmed. On the 1st Julynine Wellesleys attacked Gondar and Azozo; aircraft on the ground were hit and one of them set on fire, and other damage was caused, On the 30th June our bombers attacked troop concentrations on the Abyssinian frontier 25 miles east of Kassala, and again raided Acico where the results were not observed; one ofour aircraft is missing from the latter operation. On the 1st July one enemybomber was destroyed and five damaged during an attack by our bombers on the aerodromes at Gondar and Azozo. On the 4th July five Wellesleys attackedMetemma Camp (310 miles S.E. of Khartum). Hits were obtained on stores anda camp and a machine-gun post was destroyed.  One of our aircraft was lost.62. Enemy activity was slight. One aircraft attacked Gallabat on the27th June, dropping 10 bombs, 9 of which failed to explode, and two raids were directed at Port Sudan on the 29th June and one at Trinkitat, 60 miles to thesouth. No damage was caused and one enemy machine was brought down by our fighters.   A further attack on Gallabat on the 2nd July caused no damage.Kenya..63. Reconnaissance activities were continued throughout the week, and onthe 1st July four Harts of the Rhodesian Air Force raided Moyale and scored adirect hit on a hostile gun position. Enemy activity consisted of a few small raidsin which a number of the bombs dropped failed to explode.A den and Somaliland.64. Macaaca was attacked on five occasions during the week and severe damage caused. On the 27th June the W.T. station and petrol dump were successfully bombed: the latter was again attacked on the 28th June and isbelieved to have been destroyed. On the 29th. and 30th June the bomb dumpwas hit and large explosions were observed, and on the 2nd July a number of hostile aircraft were destroyed on the ground. On this occasion two hostileaircraft were shot down. Other raids were directed against Harrar andHaroreisa, 120 miles south of Jibouti. Enemy activity was relatively slight, but18 natives were killed and 14 injured in a,n attack on Berbera on the 30th June.
Malta.65. Enemy reconnaissances were frequent, but attacks were not very serious.On the 30th June a raid was carried out by light aircraft which caused slight damage and six civilian casualties, and on the 3rd July the enemy aircraft were sighted and engaged by four of our fighters. One enemy aircraft was shot down. Reconnaissances of the Italian coast and anti-submarine patrols were carried out, and on the 29th June two hostilesubmarines were attacked. One of these was destroyed by a SunderlandFlying Boat, which picked up four survivors. On the 30th June enemy destroyers were bombed and subsequently engaged by our naval forces, one being sunk.On the same evening the oil refinery and tanks at Augusta, Sicily, were attacked and set on fire by five Swordfish. On the 4th July 12 enemy fighters made a machine-gun attack on Elal Far aerodrome, causing no casualties, but inflictingslight damage to two Swordfish aircraft.Gibraltar.66. Submarine patrols, convoy escort and reconnaissance work were maintained throughout the period. On the 4th July a Sunderland was attacked by three French Curtiss fighters, one of which was definitely shot down and anotherprobably destroyed.   The Sunderland was slightly damaged.German Air Force.Operations.67. Offensive operations by the long-range bombers of the G.A.F. have continued during the past week on a comparatively minor scale. It is apparent that the main aim of the G.A.F. High Command is as was expected, namely, tobuild up and consolidate all formations after the damage and wastage whichthey had suffered in the Battle for France, and to complete the re-equipment of certain bomber units. Although operations have been carried out againstthe British Isles, as already described, possibly with the intention of appeasingpublic opinion, maintaining morale, learning the operational area and to testthe British fighter defences, the scale of these attacks has been consistent withthe main aim which continues to be pursued with great vigour.68. Attacks on shipping in the English Channel were carried out by air-craft from the Paris area, during the afternoon the 2nd July, but the results are not yet known, and minelaying has been carried out off the East Coast andin the English Channel on most nights. A standing fighter patrol has been main-tained over the area between Boulogne and Calais, as already described.69. Transport aircraft have maintained a high level of activity throughoutthe week. They have been employed chiefly in bringing up supplies and fuel tomain aerodromes such as Grimbergen, Evere and Hingene and the distributingit to advanced bases.Intelligence.70. Serviceability of Aircraft. Some figures of serviceability of aircraftsince the 10th May are available. Unfortunately these figures are not complete and only relate to a few Geschwader, but it would seem that at the middle ofJune the average serviceability of bomber units was about 55 per cent, of theestablishment and of fighter units slightly higher, at about 65 per cent.Subsequent figures are available up to the beginning of July; these again onlyrefer to a few Geschwader, but they indicate that the general serviceability of bomber Geschwader is slightly lower than the above figure at around 45 per cent.Similar figures on the fighters indicate that they are maintaining serviceabilityof about 65 per cent. Little information is available as to crews, but generally the percentage of available crews is slightly higher than the proportion of service-able aircraft. The present lull in operations is being used to press ahead withthe re-equipment of certain units and the achievement of the highest possibledegree of serviceability in all units. It seems probable that most units will have completed their technical overhauls by about the 15th July.i 71.   Frequency of Sorties. A review of the activity of the German Air force during the past two months has produced the following information regardingthe number of sorties carried out by individual aircraft and crews.  During May[21486] c 2
certain aircraft drawn from a variety of units averaged two sorties every three days. This high average was maintained during June by other aircraft drawn from a similar variety of units. Two examples of the number of sorties madeare nine sorties in eleven days and six sorties in six days. One crew of a long-range bomber unit carried out five sorties in five days&apos; operations in Norway.They then returned to their base in North-West Germany where they remainedfor a week, to rest and consolidate prior to the invasion of Holland. They took part in these operations and made twenty-three sorties during the first thirty days. Although all units of the G.A.F. have not been operating at such a highpitch, the above facts show that aircraft and crews are capable of a very highconcentrated effort over a long period.72. Crew Accommodation in Long-Range Bombers. It is well known thatcrews of German aircraft such as the Do. 17 and the Ju. 88 are all accommodatedtogether in the nose. The Germans have declared that one of the main reasonsfor this policy is to support the morale of the crew by putting them in such close proximity to each other that they never feel that they are fighting alone. after examination of a British heavy bomber, the fact that the crew were spread out and not accommodated in one cabin was expressly commented on by the Germans,and this may indicate a lack of understanding of British temperament and individual resource.73. Norway. Some 300 long-range bombers are based in Norway and denmark and this number could easily be increased. About 50 bomber-reconnais-sance aircraft operate from Norway. While no reliable figures of twin-enginedfighters can at present be given, at least one of the bomber formations is equipped with a Staffel of Ju. 88&apos;s designed to act as fighters, and the possibility of fighter escort for long-range bombers must not be ruled out.74. Losses. The German Air Force losses from the 10th May to the2nd July inclusive are 2,218 confirmed and 898 unconfirmed. It is estimated thatthe number of German aircraft lost and seriously damaged is 2,933.75. Morale. A note on civilian morale in Germany is included, togetherwith recent Raid Assessment Reports, in Appendix VI.Italian Air Force.Operations.76. Italian air operations, which have already been covered, continue tobe of a sporadic character and tend to confirm our belief that air operations onany considerable scale from Italian East Africa are no longer possible.Air Marshal Balbo&apos;s efforts to instil more energy into the activities of the ItalianAir Force were, however, apparently beginning to take effect, and it is reportedthat the 10th raid on Mersa Matruh, by an unknown number of Italian aircraft on the 28th June, was carried out with more determination than the previousattacks.77. An unconfirmed report states that, on the Western Front, italian aircraft were first seen in action in the Vosges area, and were then engaged inattacking refugees on roads.Intelligence.78. Metropolitan Air Force. -There has been no change in unit locationsas far as Metropolitan Italy is concerned. It is nowr understood, however, that thetransfers of Italian aircraft to the German Air Force, reported to have takenplace on the 19th June, included five fighter squadrons from Mondovi (North-West Italy) to Southern France, and an unknown number of tighter aircraft fromAviano (North-East Italy) to Germany. The departure of these aircraft willhave considerably weakened the fighter forces in Northern Italy.79. Dodecanese. Strength is now considered to be 135, aircraft with 1.800air personnel at Rhodes and 800 at Lei*os.80. Italian East Africa. There are definite indications that the shortageof fighters is being felt and fighter squadrons are being split up, sections of three or four being sent to protect operational landing grounds.
81. Equipment. Information obtained from an Italian Air Force prisonerconfirms that their fighter aircraft are not equipped with R/T.82. A ir Services. The Italians are operating a bi-weekly air service between Libya and East Africa using the route Benghasi to Asmara without an intermediate landing. The straight line distance is approximately 1,700 milesand it is probable that the S. 82 troop-carrying aircraft are being used.Reports from different sources indicate that the South America (L.A.T.I.).Air Service will shortly cease to operate. Italian employees from their bases at Villa Cisneros and Rio de Oro are to return to Italy shortly.83. Morale. It is believed that Air Marshal Balbo&apos;s death will have an adverse effect on the morale of the Italian Air Force. Balbo was the idolof the younger generation and his devotion to flying provided an inspiringexample which will be greatly missed by Italian pilots. The state of Italianmorale generally is exemplified by a report from Belgrade, in which it is statedthat, when civilians entered public shelters during an air raid on Trieste, they found them already occupied by crews of A.A. guns, who remained there untilthe raid was over.General.84. It is learned that strict orders have been issued to the Italian Air force against bombing non-military objectives.Italian aircraft losses up to the 2nd June total 65 confirmed, 15 unconfirmed,and 10 damaged.Further intelligence reports of damage effected during air attacks on Italy is summarised in Appendix VI.French Air Force.85. Insufficient reliable evidence has been received to enable any clear statement to be made on the whereabouts of the aircraft and personnel of theFrench Air Force which was in France at the time of the collapse of french resistance. A not inconsiderable number of aircraft have, however, been flown to north Africa and over 400 had landed there by the 20th June. More were expected, and it is not improbable that by the end of June the total strength of aircraft in North Africa, including some 260 previously there, amounted to atleast 700, of which about 500 were modern aircraft. About 1,600 personnelaccompanied the aircraft.86. There are indications that at the moment of the collapse an effort wasmade to send out of France as many really modern aircraft as possible, leaving the more obsolescent to be handed over to the Germans. For example, according toa French source, no less than 19 Groupes over 500 aircraft out of a total of23 Groupes of single-seater fighters, and all Groupes of bombers largely Glenn-Martins and Douglas were sent to North Africa. It is understood that thefighters could only reach their destination by refuelling en route in Corsica. Butthe most interesting point about this particular report is the claim that five of the19 fighter Groupes were fully equipped with Dewoitine aircraft, presumablythe new 520. If there is any truth in this it must be assumed that these aircraft were, for the most part, new aircraft collected from the depots, because thereis strong evidence that at the beginning of June only comparatively few of the type were actually in service. Another indication that new aircraft were selected for evacuation is contained in a report from Spain to the effect that a crew of a modern bomber (L.E.O. 45), which forced-landed at Almeria on the 19th June,stated that their aircraft was one of 12 which were being flown from Marseillesto Oran &quot; to be equipped.&quot; It is also interesting to note that according to thehigh French authority already quoted, no L.E.O. 45 were included in the forma -tions to which he referred.87. Ten aircraft, including one American bomber, have been flown to gibraltar, the crews of three aircraft belonging to the Syrian Air Force have refused to return from Egypt, and two aircraft flew from Algeria to Egypt,landing on the 2nd July.
88. Only nineteen aircraft have so far been flown to Great Britain,including four modern fighters, one modern bomber, one Potez. 63 (Fighter orRecce). Three obsolescent bombers and ten trainers and passenger aircraft. Thefollowing French Air Force personnel have arrived in Great Britain :-- Nationality. Officers. A irmen.French      ...       .........        96 239Czechs............ 109 324Poles............ 973 5,180Far East.89. Continued heavy bombardment of Chungking, Szechwan, seat of theChinese Government, has resulted in further damage to the British Consulate-General, which has now been removed to the South side of the River Yangtse atChungking.Russia.90. The Russian Air Corps headquarters in Lithuan&apos; S s situated at Kovno,and consists of four fighter and four bomber regiments whi&quot;&apos; urould normally com-prise a total of 440 aircraft. Another report states that the total force of russian aircraft in the three Baltic States is about 1,000, and, in view of the fact thatthe military occupation of Lithuania seems to have been made on a larger scale than the occupation in the other two States, this figure of 440 aircraft seems tobe consistent with this latter report.Balkans.91. General. Germany is reported to have recalled about 350 pilots andother air instructors from Bulgaria, to have requested the return of the Me. 109&apos;sjust delivered to Hungary and to have held up all aircraft deliveries to Roumania,92. Roumania. King Carol is reported to be exasperated at the inefficiencyof his air force and has instituted a purge.By the occupation of Bessarabia and Bukovina, Russia will acquire at leasteighteen Roumanian aerodromes and landing grounds. None of these were ofany particular importance, and only a few of them were actually in use by theRoumanian Air Force at the time of the Russian advance. The actual loss ofthese areodromes will not upset the Roumanian organisation very much, but what will seriously affect the situation is the fact that Jassy and Galatz, two of themain Roumanian air bases, are now within only a few miles of the frontier andso lose their strategical importance.

There is no doubt that the damage done by these raidsis considerable and the effect on the morale of leading industrialists, the industrial population and the civil population of West Germany is depressing. The will ofthese classes of people to carry on the war is reported to be much weakened. Rigidcensorship is imposed to prevent spread of news about air raids, either internallyin Germany or from Germany abroad and to the armies at the Front. Lettershave, however, been intercepted from women in the Hamburg and Bremen areasin which they complain to relatives abroad of weariness, restlessness anddissatisfaction with the &quot; constant nervous tension and the dreary waratmosphere.&quot; In general, a desire for peace appears to exist among those ofthe population who are not military or militant party-members, and among thosewho have been subjected to constant bombing.The following evidence of damage caused in raids over Germany has beenreceived in the past week :  Dusseldorf. Considerable damage done in the harbour area, hits registeredand fires started in an oil, a chemical and a margarine factory and a grainwarehouse. A wood depot was burnt out. It is reported that the railway station is practically destroyed, a large factory at Krefeld badly damaged and a distilleryat Hamborn also damaged.Duisberg. The Ges. fur Teerverwertung has been hit and damaged.Essen. The Krupp Works has been hit and damaged.Gelsenkirchen. One of the oil targets attacked has been hit and a largefire broke out. Photographs disclose that several buildings comprised in the target have been severely damaged and a chimney stack has disappeared.[21486] e
Dortmund-Ems Canal. Photographs disclose the new canal north of thesouthern lock-gate to be dry, south of the gate the old and new canals containwater but at a very low level. It appears that both the old and new aqueductshave been damaged.Paderbom. A hangar and stores were fired and damaged in the attack uponthe depot, and there were casualties to personnel.Hamburg. It is known that one of the oil refineries was hit and damaged by fire, though not sufficiently to stop production. It is reported that cotton andrubber stores were destroyed by fires started in the harbour area and that a navalvessel (either a destroyer or a submarine) which had just been launched was hit and sank in the harbour.Emmerich. Photographs show that the attack on the oil target DeutscheGasolin A.G. has been very successful. The photographs show hits on marshalling yards and quays adjacent to the refinery and that 5 out of 8 of the oil storage tankshave been destroyed or badly damaged. There is considerable general damage tothe refinery, and the evidence indicates that damage has been caused to gas and oil lines, and to lesser but important items of refinery equipment. The refinerywill probably not be in operation for some months.Hoeesht. The part of the chemical factory attacked dealing with plasticswas burnt out, and that part dealing with fast dyes and the clerical offices werebadly damaged. There were casualties to personnel, but the production has not altogether stopped.Bremen. Completed machines in a Jrangar were badly damaged and therewere casualties to j^ersonnel in the raid upon the Focke Wulf Works.Nordenham. A steamer waiting to load coal was delayed fourteen daysowing to damage caused to the railways.Saar. A blast furnace at Voelklingen hit and damaged.Railways. It is reported that the effect of raids upon marshalling yards and trains is beginning to have a serious effect upon railway transportation. Thestation at Baden Baden has been considerably damaged.Italy.Turin.-- A later report, evidently from an Italian source, on the Royal AirForce raid on Turin on the night of the llth-12th June, indicates that the damage to the Fiat factory was considerable, but that Germany was rapidly replacingdamaged stocks and equipment.Palermo. Further reliable reports on raids by French aircraft on Palermoon the 23rd June indicate that the aerodrome, aircraft factory, shipyard, railway station, foundry and custom house were all hit, but the extent of the damage isnot known. The Italian wireless communique of the 24th June, referring to theraids, stated that no military objectives were struck, but that 25 civilians were killed and 153 wounded.Trapani (Sicily). A further raid by French aircraft on Trapani on the22nd June is falsely attributed to the Royal Air Force by the Italian BroadcastCommunique of the same date.Although Trapani has a submarine base, a naval dockyard and is protected by a fighter station only 7 kms. distant, it is claimed as a non-military objective,and Royal Air Force pilots are accused of bombing cities and killing civiliansindiscriminately.
