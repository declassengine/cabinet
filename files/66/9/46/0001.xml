THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.W.P.(40)266.(Rlpri r.O.G.(40)51)WAR CABINET.GEPJJlAN OIL.. SWPLIES.5th Report by Lord Hankey&apos;s committee on Preventing0il. from peaching, GormnnyiThe position of Germany&apos;s oil supplies arising fromthe intervention of Italy, the collapse of France,    andother new factors in the war situation, is examined indetail in the Fourth Report of Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd1sCommittee which is being circulated to the VJar Cabinet(Paper No.  W.P. (40)  26&apos;/ also P.O.G.   (40) 48).2. The Report shows that Germany can no longer beconsidered as an isolated unit.   The occupation of a large part of Europe, combined with her hegemony over Italy, has brought with it the responsibility for territories whichproduce little or no oil themselves and have for practical purposes been dependent, hitherto, on importation from overseas.    If those territories are to be exploited bythe Axis Ppvers, whether for purposes of manufacture,agriculture, fisheries or transport, they must be allowed a certain amount of petroleum products.   Some of them arealready short of supplies.5-. Thereport also shows that even after making amost conservative estimate for Germany&apos;s home production,for what the Axis Powers may be able to import from roumania and Russia, and for the stocks in Italy and thoseremaining in the occupied territories, Germany must be confronted with many difficulties.   For example, a largeproportion of the stocks are inconveniently situated.    Someof those in France and Italy may have to be removed to northern Europe where there is a shortage.   And the germans themselves, though they have sufficient oil under their control for immediate major military operations, areexperiencing difficulties in distributing supplies to thepoints at which they are required.   Another difficulty is that much of the oil is in an inconvenient form, suchas crude oil, which requires refining:   or fuel oil/ ofwhich Germany already has sufficient supplies, and whichwill have to be re-refined if it is to be converted intoproducts more urgently needed.COPY NO.

4* Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd&apos;s Committee draw the conclusionthat forcible action by air and otherwise against theGerman oil supplies would greatly accelerate the crisisfrom which the Axis 1&apos;owcrs are not very far removed andmight within a comparatively short period deprive theGerman Command of real freedom of strategy. Even Germany&apos;plans for invasion might it seems9 have to be reconsideredif destruction could bo achieved on a sufficient scale,5. The Committees urge the destruction, in the firstorder of priority5 of German hydrogenation and syntheticplants and refineries      the immediate destruction of italian and French refineries and stocks located adjacentthereto before present stocks of crude are refined;interference with means of communications from Roumaniaby the Panubc and by rail5 and from Italy and Prance by-rail, as&apos;-well as  in the second order of priority, storageinstallations9 depots0  loaded tankers, etc.6. We strongly support the recommendations of theCommittee and invite particular attention to paragraphs and 6 of their Report.    We recommend that their suggestionsshould be carried out with the utmost speed and vigourand should be sustained as long as may be necessary.    Theessential action of the should be supported to theutmost possible extent by combined operations by the three services as well as by other forcible measures.(Sgd.)
