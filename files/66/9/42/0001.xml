naval SITUATION.General Review.THE British Mediterranean Fleet and Italian fleet have been engagedwith indecisive results. Italian air action against British naval forces in theMediterranean has been generally ineffective.Further steps have been taken to prevent important units of the French Fleetfalling into enemy hands.There has been increased enemy air activity against ports and shipping; inthe Channel, and E-boats have also attacked shipping in this area with some success.Mediterranean.2. A force of cruisers and destroyers successfully attacked shipping inBardia harbour (Libya-Egyptian frontier) on the 6th July and sank two militarysupply ships. Our ships were attacked from the air without result. aircraft from the Fleet Air Arm at Malta carried out a dive-bombing attack on Cataniaaerodrome on the same date; 9,000 lbs. of bombs were dropped and four big fires were started in the hangars and workshops. A combined Fleet Air Arm andR.A.F. raid was also carried out successfully on Tobruk. The destroyer Zeffi/rowas sunk and 1 other destroyer, 1 submarine and a number of merchant shipsdamaged.H.M. Submarine Olympus was seriously damaged in Malta dock during an air raid on the 7th July.3. Early on the morning of the 8th July H.M. Submarine Phoenix reported a force of 2 enemy battleships and 4 destroyers proceeding on a southerly courseabout 200 miles east of Malta, and later in the day another force of 6 cruisers and 7 destroyers was sighted by our aircraft proceeding north 60 miles north ofBengazi. At this time a strong force of the Mediterranean Fleet, consisting of3 battleships, 4 6-inch cruisers, 1 aircraft carrier and 11 destroyers, was at seabut well to the eastward of these positions. While passing between Cyrenaicaand Crete our ships were continuously bombed and H.M.S. Gloucester was hiton the bridge, killing the Captain and inflicting further severe casualties. Onthe morning of the 9th numerous reports from our aircraft indicated that anenemy force of 2 battleships, 6 cruisers and 11 destroyers had been joined by several more cruisers and destroyers from Augusta. This force was sighted byH.M.S.Neptune at 1507 and shortly afterwards the Commander-in-Chief reportedthat he was engaging the enemy. A short and confused action resulted, theenemy retiring under cover of a smoke screen soon after the heavy ships becameengaged. H.M.S. Warspite obtained one hit on an enemy battleship at long range.A torpedo attack by aircraft from H.M.S. Eagle is believed to have resulted in1 cruiser being hit. Subsequently a damaged enemy cruiser was reported to bein tow about 70 miles from Messina at 1900. The Mediterranean Fleet sufferedno casualties either in material or personnel other than those in the Gloucester.4. The British force in the Western Mediterranean, consisting of1 battle cruiser, 1 battleship, 1 aircraft carrier, 1 6-inch cruiser and 10 destroyers,while carrying out a sweep, was bombed by enemy aircraft at intervals on the9th July, but only near misses were reported. Four aircraft were shot down and seven others damaged.In the afternoon of the 10th July an attack was made on Augusta by theFleet Air Arm. No ships wore SG6H in the harbour, but a destroyer and a hulkwere sunk in the vicinity.Home Waters.5. IT.M.S. Whirlwind was torpedoed by a U-boat in the Western Approacheson the 5th July, and subsequently had to be sunk by H.M.S. Westcott. Fifty-sevenratings were killed and 2 officers and 13 men wounded.H.M. Submarine Shark, operating off the south-west of Norway, reported at2250 on the 5th that she was unable to dive and was proceeding at 10 knots. a force of 2 cruisers and destroyers was sent out to her assistance but failed to
locate her. A German report states that the crew have been picked up by aircraft and patrol boats. Our ships were subjected to constant air attack, and h.M.S. Fame was damaged by a bomb, her speed being reduced to 20 knots.H.M.S. Furious arrived at Liverpool on the 7th July with aircraft andammunition from. Canada. H.M.S. Broke escorting a convoy in the western approaches collided with the Turkish S.S. Ussvasi Hakki and was holed abovethe water line.   The Turkish ship subsequently sank.6. The French sloop Suippe wTas damaged by a bomb during the air raid onFalmouth on the 8th July and was beached. Enemy E-boats have been reportedin the English Channel on several occasions, and on the 8th July H.M. A/STrawler Cayton Wyke was sunk. H.M. Sloop Foxglove was bombed and severely damaged off Portsmouth on the 9th July; 1 officer was killed and35 ratings wounded. The Owers Light Vessel was bombed on the 10th July, but no damage has been reported.South Atlantic.7. On the 10th July in a dense tropical storm the armed merchant cruiserCorfu was damaged in collision with H.M.S. Hermes while the former wasescorting a convoy from Freetown to the United Kingdom. Corfu was badlyholed forward and has proceeded to Freetown under escort.French Fleet.8. Four French destroyers, 5 torpedo boats and all submarine chasers inBritish ports are to be commissioned under the White Ensign. The FrenchGovernment have issued an order prohibiting British ships and aircraft fromapproaching within 20 miles of French territory at home or overseas underpenalty of being fired on without warning.A lexandria.9. Following the agreement which was concluded by Commander-in-Chief,Mediterranean, with the French Admiral Godfroy on the 4th July, the reductionof the crews of the French warships at Alexandria to a third or a quarter of full strength began on the 9th. On the 5th instant the Commander-in-Chief,Mediterranean, reported that de-oiling of ships was practically complete, andthat breech fittings of guns and torpedo warheads had been landed and placedin the custody of the French Consul-General. Reservists were embarked inmerchant ships, but the French Admiral stated he was awaiting confirmationthat arrangements had been made for the reception of active service ratingsin France before embarking them.A Igiers.10. The French warships which left Algiers on the 3rd July are reportedto have reached Toulon.On the 5th July ELM. Submarine Pandora, patrolling off Algiers, reportedthat she had sunk a French 6-inch cruiser of the La Galissoniere class. Sub-sequently Pandora was forced to dive due to bombs and depth charges.Oran.11. On the 6th July the French battle cruiser Dunkerque in Oran, which had previously been damaged, was again successfully attacked by torpedo aircraft from lord.S. Ark Royal and rendered unfit for service for some time to come.In spite of considerable fighter and anti-aircraft opposition there were no casualties to personnel and only one aircraft was lost.Casablanca.12. On the morning of the 9th July air reconnaissance reported 6 Frenchsubmarines and 2 destroyers on patrol, and the battleship Jean Bart, 1 6-inch cruiser and 8 or 10 destroyers in the harbour. 7 French submarines were statedto have left Casablanca during the night of the 5th July.[21518] b

Dakar.13. French naval guards have been placed on board British merchant ships and French flags hoisted. Following an ultimatum which was transmitted tothe French Admiral on the evening of the 7th July the battleship Richelieuwas attacked early on the morning of the 8th July by a motor boat from H.M.S.Hermes, which made its way into the harbour and exploded 4 depth chargesunder the Richelieu&apos;s stern. This operation was followed by an airborne torpedoattack, which, it is believed, resulted in 5 hits, and it is considered that theship has been definitely disabled.Anti-Submarine Operations.14. In Home Waters ten attacks were made on U-boats, of which six wereby aircraft. An attack carried out by H.M.S. Deptford in the western approaches on the 8th July followed up by attacks in the same vicinity byH.M. Destroyers Havelock and Harvester may have been successful.During this week up to six destroyers have been engaged in hunting U-boats in the Western Approaches.In the Mediterranean four attacks were carried out, of which two were by aircraft. On the 1st July H.M. destroyers Stuart and Hostile carried out a promising attack on a U-boat 90 miles north north-west of Tobruk (Libya), andon the 9th July an attack by aircraft 60 miles east of Cape Spartivento isconsidered to have been successful.H.M.S. Dorsetshire sighted two U-boats off Dakar in the afternoon of the4th July and later reported that she had sunk or damaged one.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.15. U-boat activity has now decreased, but enemy aircraft have inflictedconsiderable damage on shipping in the Channel.Three British ships (11,732 tons) and eight ships of other nations (33,219tons) have been sunk by U-boats. One small British ship (477 tons) was mined and sunk off Blyth. Two British ships (9,843 tons) were torpedoed by enemyE-boats off Portland. Four ships (12,646 tons), including two British (6,857 tons),were bombed and sunk in the Channel, and eighteen others were damaged, detailsof which are given in Appendix I.On the 4th July outward-bound convoy consisting of forty-seven shipsescorted by H.M.S. Clarkia was attacked in mid-Channel by enemy aircraft.The number of these is variously estimated at twenty and twenty-four. The firstattack was made at 1255, when the enemy aircraft was described as divingalmost vertically on the convoy in formations of six. Later attacks were made at about 1400 and 1445, and at 1540 H.M.S. Clarkia reported seven lost or damaged.The Captain of the S.S. Hartlepool, one of the ships attacked, remarkedparticularly on the efficacy of the kites flown by two of the ships in company withhim.In the course of the following night S.S. British Corporal, S.S. Hartlepooland S.S. Elmcrest were attacked by German E-boats about 20 miles off Portland.The crews were machine gunned whilst getting into the boats. Of these ships,the, British Corporal was able to get into port, but the Elmcrest broke in two and sank after a second torpedo had struck her, and the Hartlepool is a total loss.16. On the 8th July a northbound convoy was unsuccessfully attacked by enemy aircraft near - Flamborough Head, and the Channel coastal convoy was bombed off Hythe. The British S.S. Eastwood (1,551 tons), not in convoy, was bombed and hit off the joint.E. Coast, but managed to reach Hartlepool.On the 9th July British S.S. Kenneth Hawksfield (1,546 tons) was bombed and hit in the Dover area and beached off Sandwich. In the morning andafternoon of the same day 2 northbound convoys were unsuccessfully attackedoff Harwich and the Yorkshire coast, and in the early afternoon a southboundconvoy was attacked without result off Harwich. Three ships were set on fireduring an air attack on Falmouth on the 10th July, and the British S.S. Waterloo(1,905 tons) was bombed and sunk in the Thames Estuary. On the same day an outward bound convoy was bombed in the St. George&apos;s Channel, a Channel convoy was attacked twice off Portland and Dungeness and a southward convoy in the thames Approaches.
German Intelligence.19. Air reconnaissances over Trondhjem on the 8th July and Wilhelmshavenon the 9th July confirmed previous reports of last week.One 8-inch cruiser was seen at Bremen on the 9th July and is presumably theSeydlitz completing.It appears that, in addition to Ymuiden and Boulogne, German E-boats arenow also working from Cherbourg.At the present time only 2 U-boats are estimated to be in the western approaches.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.20. A report from Norway states that coastal trade has been re-established between Oslo and Bergen. Convoys arrive daily at Bergen, probably from NorthJutland Point, escorted by motor boats and aircraft. Another report indicates that Germany is insisting more and more on Swedish and Finnish ships carrying the Baltic trade, thereb3r releasing German shipping to be collected in german ports.The bauxite trade continues between Yugoslavia and North Italian ports,both the Ingo, 3,950 tons, and the Maritza, 2,910 tons, being regularlyengaged in it.It is reported from Yokohama that the Elbe, 9,179 tons, has returned to heranchorage after being in dry dock, and that the Regensburg, 8,068 tons, hasloaded 500 tons of oil. The scharnhorst, 18,184 tons, which is at Kobe, has acrew of only 45, including Chinese.The Cerigo, 1,120 tons, at Guayaquil in Ecuador, is reported to be recruitinga crew.The Erlangen, 6,100 tons, at Puerto Monte, Chile, is reported filling herbunkers and soliciting passengers to Germany for August.Lloyds surveyor has reported that the resources of the port of Aruba are sufficient to raise the Antilla, 4,400 tons, which scuttled herself there on the10th May.Italian.21. There is little to report about Italian shipping. In the Black Sea the tanker Celeno, 3,741 tons, arrived at Varna from Batum with 4,500 tons of oil fuel for Germany. The Augustus, 30,418 tons, which had been at Tripoli, was due to arrive at Genoa on the 9th July.[21518] B 2Protection of Seaborne Trade.17. A total of 842 ships, including 97 Allied and 40 neutral, were convoyedduring the week, of which 7 ships were lost by enemy action. ISline armed merchant cruisers, 29 destroyers, 16 sloops and 13 corvettes were employed on escort dutiesSince the commencement of hostilities 27,089 ships have been convoyed, ofwhich 21,613 were British. Owing to a clerical error last week, the numberof British ships convoyed since the commencement of hostilities was stated tobe 21,908 instead of 20,908.Owing to the menace of enemy air attack consequent on the capture of theChannel ports, outward-bound convoys have been routed north-about fromSouthend, and homeward-bound convoys have been ordered to proceed to ports onthe West Coast. To cater for coastal trade which must use the Channel, a convoy of about 10 ships is to sail on alternate days from Southend under escort as faras the Isle of Wight.18. Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the. week ending the 6th July totalled 826,175 tons, compared with 1,085,026 tons in the previousweek. Minerals (mainly iron ore and scrap iron) amounted to 248,574 tons, anincrease of 34,346 tons. Oil imports, in 14 tankers, were 142,175 tons. cereal imports were 169,391 tons (eleven ships were fully loaded with grain and flour).Other food imports were 95,799 tons, of which 35,012 tons were sugar, 14,294 tonsrefrigerated meat and 6,198 tons fruit.
The Pollenzo, 6,470 tons, which had been seized off Gibraltar, has now been released as the Spaniards claimed that she was in Spanish territorial waters.The Capo Noli, 3,921 tons, which set herself on fire in the St. Lawrence River onthe 9th June and ran aground, has been refloated and taken to Quebec. TheSistiana, 5,827 tons, which was seized at Cape Town, has been taken over by theSouth African Railways and Harbours, and renamed the Myriea.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.Home Waters.22. Up to the present there are no signs of any intensive mining of our ports and none have been laid off the West Coast this week.The small port of Amble, some twenty miles north of the Tyne, has been closed since the 4th July, when a dredger was mined and sunk there. The Tynewas closed for two days from the 5th July, and LL sweeps exploded three mines in that area on the 7th July. The inshore channel between the Tyne and Blyth,which included the Tyne Examination Anchorage, has been closed since the8th July. Hartlepool was closed on the 6th July for a day, and on the 7th JulyM. sweep exploded a mine there. The Tees was closed for two days from the6th July.Soon after 1 a.m. on the 3rd July mines were seen to drop near the CorkLight vessel off Harwich. LL sweepers were sent out immediately and explodedmines at 5-55 a.m. and 6-43 a.m. The approach channel was reported clear by8 o&apos;clock. Next morning at about 3 a.m. two dropped mines were suspected and again the channel was reported clear within an hour or two of daylight. Thesame day a shrimper was sunk by exploding a mine in her trawl &quot;beams on theStone Banks to the south of the entrance to Harwich. LL sweep exploded a mine well to the south of the channel on the 8th July.Two mines were exploded in the Downs channel on the 5th July, and threeon the 9th July by LL sweeps. A baby LL drifter, which was carrying outtrials off Portsmouth on the 9th July, exploded a mine, thereby scoring thefirst success with this type of sweep before it had completed its trials.The magnetic mine total is 324, LL sweeps having accounted for 173.23. Last week it was reported that an enemy submarine was suspected of having laid mines in the North Channel, between the Mull of Kintyre andIreland. The 57th Minesweeping Group has searched this area and foundnothing.A contact mine was exploded in the sweep in the Would on the 3rd July.The contact mine total is now 434.Four Norwegian trawlers are to be equipped with Oropesa sweeps and theywill be allocated as a Group to the Rosyth Command. If found suitable, someof the French trawlers will be fitted with the LL sweep.Foreign Waters.24. New searched channels have been established at Port Sudan andDar-es-Salaam.Information has been received during the week to the effect that seven moremines had been swept on the Agulhas Bank off the Cape, making a total of 8.Bucharest has broadcast that mines have been laid off the mouth of the danube.The Dutch Naval Authorities in London reported that minefields have been partly laid off Tarakan and Balik Papan on the east coast of Dutch Borneo,and off the Western entrance of Sourabaya in Java.British Minelaying.25. Minelaying in the East Coast Barrier has continued during the period under review. H.M.S. Teviot Bank laid 276 mines on the 4th July aiid a further275 on the 7th July. H.M.S. Plover and the Dutch Willem van der Zaan laid170 mines in the Wash on the&apos; 5th July and 170 more on the following day. Onthe 4th July H.M. Submarine Narwhal laid 50 mines in the Trondhjem area.Minelaying by aircraft has been carried out in the Baltic and its approaches, aswell as in the North-West German estuaries and in the vicinity of the dutch and Flemish coasts.
Economic Warfare.26. During the week ending the 6th July the British Contraband Committeehas dealt with the cases of only 13 ships. Of these, one Italian ship was seizedin prize, and some parts of the cargo of six ships were seized or requisitioned, andone Norwegian and three neutral ships were released. A valuable cargo of aluminium was seized when the Italian Capoolmo was captured, and this ship is being brought in convoy to the United Kingdom.MILITARY SITUATION.German Activities.27. Increased preparations for a possible invasion of the United kingdom have been reported, and it is possible that in Norway preparations for a seaborneexpedition of two to three divisions, including some A.F.Vs., must now be nearlycomplete. It is, however, still uncertain if all, or any, of these forces are intended for the invasion of the United Kingdom. Eire, the Shetlands, the Faroes andIceland are all possible subsidiary objectives.Air reconnaissance of Bremen and Emden has not shown the presence ofany abnormal quantity of shipping. No concentration of shipping has been observed in the ports of the Low Countries and Northern France. While thereis a considerable number of barges in these ports, this may be due to the inter-ruption of other communications and does not necessarily indicate preparations for invasion.Italy.28. Italian G.H.Q. published on the 8th July the first list of casualties inthe divisions operating on the western Alpine front as well as that of the killed in Italian East Africa. No names were published, but the list gave the following figures : &apos;Alpine Front.Killed..................        770Wounded        ............      ...      2,982Missing ............... 315Italian East Africa.Killed   ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 43Iceland.29. One battalion and one machine-gun battalion of Canadian troopsarrived in Iceland on the 7th July.Libya.30. Italian activity has been mainly confined to attempts to relieve orreinforce Fort Capuzzo. There has been considerable M.T. activity betweenBardia and Fort Capuzzo, which has resulted in the destruction by our forcesof a certain number of vehicles. The Italian native garrison still remains atBir El Gobi. It is possible that this force is being retained to attack the left flank of any British force attempting to occupy Bardia by land action.Sudan, Italian East Africa and Kenya.31. Offensive activity by Italian mobile forces has resulted in the capture of Kassala and Gallabat. On the 7th July the Sudan frontier post at Kurmukwas attacked and our garrison withdrew after inflicting casualties. It is probablethat the Italian forces also withdrew on the same day, as the Italian officialcommunique characterised the action as a raid. The situation is being investi-gated. After spasmodic artillery action against British Moyale, the post was heavily attacked on the 10th July and is now partially surrounded.
sAden.32. The 2nd Battalion Black Watch has arrived in Aden from Egypt as areinforcement to French Somaliland if required.Palestine.33. Additional Allied troops have arrived in Palestine from Syria. Thetotal number is now :  Officers.    Other ranks.Polish       ...............      489 3,593French       ............... 8 204Czech        ...............        ... 202Balkan States.34. In Bulgaria the two divisions in the north-east near the Dpbrujafrontier are being reinforced by some 20,000 reservists. Although Bulgaria maynot be contemplating aggressive action against Roumania in existing circum-stances, she is likely to take advantage of any further disruption of Roumaniato occupy the Southern Dobruja.AIR SITUATION.General Review.35. Our bombing attacks have been on a lower scale than recently, owingto adverse weather conditions, though minelaying has been more extensive.Fighter operations have been considerably more intense than recently and havebeen almost entirely over this country. Enemy air attacks were mainly concen-trated against ports and shipping and were becoming heavier towards the endof the week. Operations in the Mediterranean and Middle East were of asimilar character to those of last week.Great Britain.36. Enemy bombing attacks by day have been concentrated mainly on ourSouthern and South-Western ports and on shipping in the Channel. casualties have been higher, but little serious damage has been done to objectives on land.Raids on the East Coast and on Scotland have been less frequent and reconnais-sance appears to have been their primary objective. There has been little deeppenetration except during the hours of darkness, when attacks were relatively light and achieved little success. Activity increased steadily up to the 10th July, when a formation of about 120 bombers and fighters assembled behind Calais andattempted to attack a convoy between Dover and Dungeness. Minelaying appearsto have continued nightly during the week off the South and East Coasts. Adiary of enemy bombing attacks is given in Appendix V.37. Fighter operations have been of considerably increased intensity.Enemy attacks have been escorted by fighters, which have, also carried out sweepsover the South Coast. Fighter Command flew 1,040 patrols, involving 3,275sorties, over this country and destroyed 44 enemy aircraft confirmed &quot;and 33unconfirmed; enemy casualties included 33 fighters.   Our losses totalled 18.Attacks on Germany and German-Occupied Territory.38. Weather conditions were largely instrumental in limiting both our day and night bomber operations during the week. The reduction of the scale of air attack on this country has remained a primary objective, but attacks on enemyports and shipping concentrations have been intensified. Bomber Command flew202 day and 312 night sorties, in the course of which we lost 20 aircraft by day and 7 by night; two enemy fighters were destroyed.
39. By day, cloud conditions have often been unfavourable, and aircraft have not always been able to reach their primary objectives. Nevertheless, anumber of very successful daylight attacks were carried out. Weather conditions were generally adverse at night, especially during the latter part of the week.Targets frequently could not be located and results were generally impossible to observe. Considerable damage is, however, believed to have been done to ship-yards and docks, while attacks on oil and other objectives in North-West Germanyhave been continued. A summary of our attacks is contained in Appendix VI,to which extracts from recent Raid Assessment Reports have been added.North Sea and Coastal.40. Reconnaissance flights were maintained over the coasts of Norway,Germany, Holland, Belgium and France in the face of considerable anti-aircraft and fighter opposition. Movements of enemy warships were reported off norway and two attacks were made on submarines, one of which was promising. ThePhotographic Development Unit was especially active, and photographs were obtained of Hamburg, Stavanger and many other objectives. Minelaying opera-tions were intensified, Bomber Command alone making 65 sorties. fighter command flew only 28 sorties over Northern France during the week.41. On the 7th July an attack by aircraft of Coastal Command was directed against the Bassin de Chasses and Leopolds Bassin at Ostend. Aircraft failedto locate these targets but successfully attacked a large ship and lock gates.On the 8th July two Blenheims attacked the Condorcet in Brest Harbour, and anti-aircraft batteries at Cherbourg were attacked on the 10th, but results wereunobserved. On the 11th a He. 59 floatplane was destroyed by an Anson, andone, and possibly a second, He. Ill bomber by a Blenheim escorting a convoy.42. Coastal Command flew 240 routine and 141 special patrols, involving598 sorties; 109 convoys were escorted. Coastal Command lost twelve aircraft during the week.Middle Bast and Mediterranean.Egypt.43. On the 4th July three Gladiators shot down two enemy fighters nearSollum. Later in the same day six Gladiators met nine enemy fighters and shot down seven of them. The other two are believed to have been badly damaged.One of our aircraft was lost. Successful bombing operations were carried out against Bir el Gubbi on the 4th July, and against M.T. and troop concentrationsat Bardia on the following day. The attack on Tobruk on the 5th has alreadybeen described in the Naval Section.44. Enemy attacks have been light and have achieved little success. raids on Alexandria took place on the 4th, 7th and the 9th July. The damage and casualties caused by these were negligible, and three of the attacking aircraft are believed to have been brought down. In addition, attacks were made on Aboukiron the 4th July and on Mersa Matruh on the 6th. The latter attack destroyedan oil stores. On the 10th one Lysander was destroyed by an attack onSidi Barrani.Sudan.45. Metamma was successfully bombed by Wellesleys on the 2nd July and again on the 5th July. One of our aircraft was lost. Raids on Zula were carriedout on the 5th and the 8th July. Considerable damage was done to the jetty and oil stores and two enemy aircraft are believed to have been destroyed on theground. Another was shot down over the sea. Direct hits were made on campbuildings at Massawa on the 8th July. On the 10th Wellesleys attacked a wirelesspost near Asmara.46. On the 4th July the enemy attacked with bomber support and occupiedKassala and Gallabat. Two enemy aircraft are believed to have been forced downin enemy territory. Small enemy raids on Malakal and Atbara took place onthe 6th and the 7th July.
Kenya.47. Activity was mainly confined to reconnaissance, but on the 4th JulyLugh Ferrandi was bombed by aircraft of the South African Air Force whoinflicted considerable damage. Small enemy attacks on Muddo on the 6th July,and on Buna on the following day were ineffective. Reconnaissances by the rhodesian Air Squadron were continued. Photographs of Kismayu, salved froma Battle of the South African Air Force, which forced landed on the 19th June,reveal three half buried oil tanks connected by pipe-line with the jetty andanchorage.Aden.48. Reconnaissances were continued throughout the week. On the 8th JulyMacaaca and Diradawa were raided. The former was again attacked on the9th and the 10th July. The last raid secured a hit on a hangar and destroyedthree fighters on the ground.Malta.49. Although enemy reconnaissance flights and bomber attacks have beenfrequent they have caused few casualties and comparatively little damage. one enemy aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft fire on the 6th July and anotherby fighters on the 9th July. The bombing was, on the whole, more accurateand better controlled than previously. Two raids were carried-out by bombersescorted by fighters, and on the 4th July a low-flying machine-gun attack wasmade on Halfar aerodrome. These aircraft were OR. 32&apos;s or 42&apos;s and made their attack in sections of three, the remaining six patrolling over the objective.No casualties resulted from this attack. In general the results of all attacks were small in proportion to the increased intensity of the bombing. Civilianproperty, however, suffered more than heretofore, and it is considered likely thatthe Italians are deliberately causing this, whilst ostensibly concentrating on military targets, with the intention of shaking the morale of the Maltese civilpopulation. There have been no further reports of the Heinkel lll&apos;s which were stated to have led one of the first raids on Malta.50. On the 5th July a successful raid on Catania was carried out without loss by nine Swordfish. Considerable damage was done to the aerodrome and numerous fires started. No fighter opposition was encountered although a concentration of the latest M. 200 fighters is known to be located there.51. On the 9th July Sunderland aircraft sighted an Italian Battle Squadronwith which contact was subsequently made by our naval forces.Gibraltar.52. Reconnaissance and anti-submarine patrols were maintained. On the4th July four raids by single French aircraft were made but caused no damage,and on the 10th July an unidentified aircraft believed to have been Frenchattacked an anti-submarine patrol.German Air Force.Operations.53. Throughout the past -week there has been a gradual increase in thescale of operations carried out by the German long-range bomber force. this increase set in after the 1st, on which day aircraft from only three geschwadertook part. Prior to the 4th, attacks had been directed chiefly against landobjectives, but on and after this date ports on the South Coast and shipping inthe North Sea became important targets. These attacks on Great Britain havealready been described. In a raid on Portland on the 4th, short-range divebombers were seen in action against a target in this country for the first time.It is expected that greater use will now be made of this type of aircraft against targets on or near the South Coast and against shipping in the Channel, as themajority of short-range dive bomber units are stationed at aerodromes inNorthern France.
- 54. As already mentioned, land objectives in this country have consistedmainly of docks, industrial targets, including aero-engine and airframe factories,and aerodromes. Reconnaissance aircraft have also been paying particular attention to these objectives, which indicates that part of the bombing effort maybe directed against these in the near future.55. Two weather flights were made in the North Sea on most days and twoin the English Channel. On two days, one of the Channel flights included alarge part of Southern Eire. Fighter aircraft escorted bombers on their raids against shipping and have also been encountered by our aircraft over Kent. the night-flying training of heavy fighters over an area in Holland West of Weselcontinues.56. Mine-laying aircraft have been identified on several nights, and it isprobable that they were out every night. War operational training of an unknown type has taken place on several days in the regions of Rugen and Earthin the Baltic.Intelligence.57. Employment of Long-Mange Bomber Formations. The long-range bombers of the German Air Force can of course be used for any type of bombingmission, but it is of interest to note that units are frequently employed onmissions of a similar character and appear to specialise in the attack of certainclasses of objectives.58. Serviceability. The refitting of units, which was referred to last week,is apparently taking longer than was anticipated. It may be that units are being brought up to strength as far as possible by overhauling and repairing existingunit aircraft in order to avoid reducing seriously the number of aircraft in reserve, and that this was found possible in view of the period which all three services required for the completion of preparations for their next offensive. If,therefore, it is the intention to throw the whole weight of the Air Force intothis offensive, it may be withheld until the end of July.59. Losses. From the 10th May to the 9th July inclusive, losses were,264 confirmed and 922 unconfirmed. It is estimated that the total of enemy aircraft lost and seriously damaged during this period is probably 2,977.60. Appendices. Extracts from recent Raid Assessment Reports areincluded in Appendix VI. A brief account of the work of the Coastal units ofthe German Air Force is given in Appendix VII.Italian Air Force.Operations.61. Operations have continued in all theatres at much the same intensityas last week, though the attacks on Malta were rather heavier and more effective,towards the end of the week.Intelligence.62. German Fighters. Messerschmidt fighters are now reported at Taliedo(Milan). It is considered that, in view of the moral effect of our raids on Milan,these aircraft have been supplied at the urgent request of Italy for the defenceof her industry.It is reported that the Italians are very disappointed at the small numberof A.A. guns which have been supplied by Germany.63.   Civil Air Line. It has been confirmed that the Rome-Barcelona service is being operated by the Ala Littoria three times weekly in each direction.Passengers are carried, and accommodation is booked for three weeks ahead.[21518] c
64. Balbo&apos;s death. It is now believed that Air Marshal Balbo&apos;s aircraftcame in to land at Tobruk during the Royal Air Force raid which took place onthe 28th June, when 15 Blenheims successfully bombed the aerodrome. A numberof enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground and it is fairly certain that hisaircraft was hit and set on fire immediately after landing.65. Use of Gas. From reports obtained from prisoners it is certain thatstores of gas bombs exist throughout Italian East Africa. It is not known,however, whether they represent new stocks or were left over from the Abyssiniancampaign.66. East A frica -Movement of one Section of S. 79&apos;s from Acldis to Gura,and one Squadron of Ca. 113&apos;s from Dessie to Agordat may indicate further attacks on the Sudan frontier. From the present location of bomber units itdoes not appear that further attacks will be made on Aden for the time being.Attempts have been made to intercept our aircraft with Ro. 37 reconnaissance aircraft. This undoubtedly proves the shortage of effective fighter defence in italian West Africa.67. Sicily. The concentration of fighter and bomber squadrons continues.Very little use is made of permanent aerodromes, squadrons operating from fieldsnear plantations which afford cover for aircraft when on the ground. Communi-cation between ground stations is by field telephone and with higher formationsby teleprinter. Special observation centres have been set up to report the approach of enemy aircraft. It would appear from this that standing fighterpatrols are not maintained.68. Dodecanese. Italian Air Force in Rhodes has been reinforced by18 S. 79&apos;s which have been transferred from Comiso (Italy). It is anticipatedthat a further 18 will.be transferred shortly.69. Losses. Losses in aircraft for the week ending the 9th are 18 confirmed,6 unconfirmed and 11 damaged, bringing the total to 125 (83 confirmed, 21 uncon-firmed and 21 damaged).U.S.A.Naval Aviation Expansion.70. Congress has authorised the maintenance by the U.S. Navy of &quot;notmore than 10,000 useful naval airplanes &quot; (of which 850 will be operated by theNaval Reserve) and &quot;not more than 48 non-rigid lighter-than-air craft,&quot; andthe provision of training facilities &quot; for 16,000 naval aviators and enlistedpilots.&quot; The Act further authorises the Secretary of the Navy &quot; to establish,develop or incr6 is iiciVcij. aviation facilities &quot; ashore at nineteen strategiclocalities at a total cost of not more than $124,132,000 (approximately 25,540,000 at par).71. The main purpose of the Act is to enable the Navy to proceed immediatelywith its pilot expansion programme. At present they have 2,958 pilots on activeduty and some 1,176 at various stages of training, and it is estimated that 6,600will be required eventually for operation wdth vessels of the Fleet. At present only about 500 training aircraft are on strength. It is proposed to procure 808training aircraft in 1941 and 1,000 in 1942. This will raise the total of trainingaircraft to 2,300, which it is estimated will suffice for the training of the 16,000pilots. During the hearings before the House Naval Affairs Committee,Admiral Towers, Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, was most emphatic thatthe dying training of these 16,000 pilots could not be completed in under fouryears.Hungary.72. New Aircraft. Our Air Attache at Belgrade reports that Italy issupplying Hungary with 16 Caproni 135 bis bombers, which will be flown toHungary via Yugoslavia. It had previously been reported that Italy wished toreplace 27 of the Caproni 310 bombers in Hungary with Caproni 135&apos;s. It maybe that this exchange is now taking place. If this is the case, the Hungarianswould appear to have got the worst of the bargain.        -
Roumania.73. New Aircraft. Rounaania had placed an order with Italy for 12Cant Z 501 flying boats. Six of these were delivered in March and final deliverieswere due to be completed in June. An authoritative report now states that 18 ofthese flying boats are ready for delivery, and that permission is being askedfor them to fly to Roumania, non-stop across Yugoslavia. Since the russian advance into Bessarabia there have been continuous rumours of German andItalian bombers being sent to Roumania. One report stated that 60 such air-craft had arrived at Brasov. These rumours are current in Bucharest, but sofar are unconfirmed, and are possibly due to wishful thinking on the part ofthe Roumanians, who fee! that material assistance from Germany or Italy is their only hope against further Soviet aggression.Spain.74. General Yaque. General Franco has ordered General Yague, the lateAir Minister, to be banished to Soria, his native town. General Yague was suspected of supporting a German suggestion that Spain should attack Portugal,and his outspoken comments that Spain should enter the war so as to share in the booty raised a storm of protest from those who still desire peace, and ledto his downfall.75. German and Italian Aircraft. There is no confirmation of reports that german and Italian aircraft have landed in Spain. Some of the Spanish air-craft still carry their old German and Italian markings. When these are seen in the air they naturally lead to rumours.76. French Aircraft. At least 14 French military aircraft have forcedlanded in Spain since the collapse of France. The French have been negotiatingfor their release, but it appears that they will be interned.77. Balearics. -The air strength in the Islands now consists of 105 aircraft,of which 50 are bombers and 40 fighters mostly obsolescent types.78.   Petrol Stocks. The petrol stocks in Spain are estimated to consistof about 50,000 tons all told.   The stocks of aviation spirit are very low.   the exact quantity is not known, but a well-informed source puts the amount asbeing &quot; sufficient for 450 aircraft to fly for 25 hours.&quot;   This expression, thoughindicates that the stocks are certainly low.Russia.79. Air Ranks. It was previously reported that new ranks for Sovietofficers had been introduced into the Red Army. Smushkevitch, the Chief ofthe Air Force, has been given the.low rank of General-Lieutenant of Aviation,vtfhich he shares with 12 other Air Force officers. It is not certain why theChief of the Air Force should have been given the equivalent rank of Major-General, but the lists of officers confirm that the status of the Air Force is thatof a component part of the Army, and is regarded as a specialised arm, suchas tanks or artillery.Japan.80. Parachute Troops. In addition to the recent reports of training at nanking, Hankow and Hainan Island, it is reported that parachute training has been carried out daily at Whampoa in the Canton area since the beginningof June. Twin-engine monoplanes are being used, three to four parachutistsjumping from each aircraft.81. Hainan. Reports of air activity suggest that the air strength on HainanIsland may have been increased to 200 aircraft mainly concentrated at Sama atthe southern extremity of the Island. Details are at present lacking, but sucha concentration would naturally form part of the measures of preparedness for eventual action against Indo-China referred to above..[21518] c 2
China.82. Netu Aviation School. It is reliably reported that a large aviationschool has recently been established at Hi, in Sinkiang, under the management of-Russian personnel. It is possible that this personnel has been recruited fromthe instructional staff who recently left the Russian contingent with the ChineseAir Force at Chengtu (Szechwan).83. Chungking. Severe bombing of Chungking (Szechwan), seat of theChinese Government continues.Indo-China.84. Tokyo-Bangkok Air Route. According to unofficial reports which are,however, likely to be correct, the French authorities have given permission forthe above route to pass over Indo-China territory and to use the aerodrome atHanoi.Netherlands Bast Indies.85. New Refinery. The new aviation spirit refinery at Palembang continuesto produce ahead of schedule and has now reached a daily figure of 800 barrelsof 92 octane.86. Re-equipment. There are reliable indications that the DefenceAuthorities are planning to replace their twin-engine Glenn Martin 139 W and166 W bombers by more modern American types. This would appear to be independent of their recent decision to increase their first-line strength by 144modern American fighters, dive-bombers and reconnaissance aircraft.

Casualties to Naval Personnel.During the week under review the following casualties have been reported : Officers : 9 killed, 2 wounded.Ratings : 152 killed, 142 wounded.APPENDIX Y.Summary of Air Attacks on Great Britain.Daylight Attacks.4zth July. In the afternoon a convoy was attacked in the. Channel. two merchant vessels were abandoned and five others badly damaged. A secondconvoy was attacked off Dover by bombers with fighter escort; two Me. 109&apos;s were shot down.5th July. Some bombs were dropped on towns in the south-west and in the humber Area, and attacks were made on shipping off Land&apos;s End. In the evening there was further activity near the Humber. In the course of the dayone He. Ill was shot down off Folkestone, but raiders made full use of cloudcover.Qth July. Enemy activity was greatest over Scotland and north-east england. One formation appears to have unloaded its bombs in the sea; theremainder did not bomb. A Do. 215 was shot down 100 miles off Aberdeen anda He. Ill off Dover. In addition, numerous raids occurred over the South andSouth-East coasts and several towns were bombed. A few casualties were caused,but no serious material damage was reported. A single aircraft penetrated toAldershot. The casualties were five military and two civilians killed, 23 militaryand one civilian wounded.7th July. The main effort was directed against south coast ports and shipping in the Straits of Dover. Two raids, consisting of 40 and 18 aircraft respectively, approached Dungeness from Boulogne. Both were intercepted by fighters. Three Me. 109&apos;s (confirmed) and one Me. 110 (unconfirmed) of the firstwere shot down, and four of our fighters were lost. &quot;The second was driven off, no damage to shipping being reported. Bombs were dropped at a number of coast towns, the most serious casualties being at Pen hale Military Camp, where15 were killed and many wounded, 15 seriously. Elsewhere, the total casualties were 12 killed and 23 injured. The docks at Falmouth were damaged. A Do. 17intercepted off the Isle of Wight was pursued to Cherbourg, where it was shot down. During pursuit it dropped about 20 boxes of wire traps, two of whichstruck a fighter without harming it.8th July. (Bombs were again dropped on towns in the south-west. No heavy damage was caused, but the Naval and Military Barracks at Devonport were hit and suffered some casualties. Reconnaissance flights were made over the thames estuary and bombing occurred at Ipswich, Walton on the Naze, North Coatesand Grimsby. An attack was made on a convoy near Sunder land, and two largeraids on shipping were intercepted off Dungeness during the afternoon. enemy casualties were five Me. 109&apos;s, two Ju. 88&apos;s and two He. lll&apos;s confirmed; twoMe. 109&apos;s and one He. 112 unconfirmed.9th July. Attacks on shipping were intensified. Three attacks were madeon convoys and ships south-west of the Isle of Wight and South of Portland.Attacks off the East Coast were slightly less intense than those off the south coast, but four attacks were made on one convoy and three on another. A trawlerwas bombed off Kinnaird&apos;s Head. Enemy losses were five fighters confirmed,eleven unconfirmed; five bombers confirmed, one unconfirmed.[21518] d
10th July. Activity of the same type continued and was particularly heavyin the west; Channel shipping, as well as ports on the south and west coasts,was attacked and some substantial damage was done, especially in Wales andat Falmouth. Attacks on the East Coast were again less intense. enemy casualties were eight fighters confirmed, eleven unconfirmed; four bombersconfirmed, six unconfirmed.11 th July (till 12 noon). In the morning, raids were chiefly by single aircraft. Bombs dropped at Melbourne, Derbyshire, caused a few militarycasualties, and at Bridlington the station was hit and an ammunition truckblown up. Attacks were made on shipping oft&apos; the Isle of Wight and, by a fewaircraft, off the South-West Coast.Night Attacks.4th15th July. About 20-25 aircraft were engaged. The Severn area wasraided by aircraft operating from France, there were raids on Dover and Cromer,and one aerodrome in the east of England was attacked, with some.damage to buildings. : ;5th/$th July.-Bombs were dropped at Goole, Scunthorpe, Mablethorpe andIpswich.

Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following information has been received during the past week : Kiel.The Scharnhorst and a Pocket Battleship are both badly damaged and twobuildings in the harbour have been destroyed. Photographs show the harbourarea covered with oil over 8 miles. It is thought that this was caused by animportant pipeline being cut from which delivery could not be cut off.Cologne :It is reported that a chemical factory was destroyed and the police head-quarters, a prison and a left wing of the Town Hall damaged.Hanover:A large petrol store has been completely destroyed by fire.Railways :The Hoeschfc-Koenigstein railway has been hit and cut and reports havebeen received of the considerable railway disorganisation especially in the rhineland and Westphalia. The damage caused to sidings is presenting serious problems as to diversion of traffic, and traffic blocks in areas such as Hamm, Soest,dusseldorf and Cologne are increasing.APPENDIX VII.German Air Force Work of Coastal Units.It is believed that all coastal units of the G.A.F. have now been identified.They comprise coastal-reconnaissance, carrier-borne and ship-borne aircraft;some 400 in all. They also include a few aircraft which could be used for transport purposes, such as the Do. 26 and Ha. 138, while the Ju. 52 on floats hasalready been used in Norway as transport aircraft of the coastal type.During the past ten months coastal units have carried out a variety of duties and in view of the marked increase in the activity of these units in June and july, a review of their different activities is of interest. In the early part ofthe war, coastal aircraft not only performed reconnaissance work for the long-range bomber units engaged in offensive action over the North Sea, but also attacked convoys and laid mines. In the Norwegian campaign, coastal unitscarried out very little offensive action. Their work seems to have been mainly of a reconnaissance nature and included land and sea objectives and weatherflights.   They also assisted in the transport of supplies to the Narvik area.Some of the Coastal units have worked at very high intensity and one hasrecently been carrying out .,s^ioa^DficiaI JBaltic training probably connected withflame-throwing. The activities or the coastal aircraft also&quot;include a^HSrln^sea and salvage^service. The aircraft employed, mainly Ju. 52&apos;s and He. 59&apos;s, aremarked with a large red cross, carry no armament and are painted white, andthe staffeln are known as &quot; Seenotelafieln.&apos;&apos; The number of such salvage aircraft is believed to have increased recently; a further indication perhaps of North sea and Channel operations on a high scale.In general the coastal units have accomplished valuable work, but theirpotential striking power has not been demonstrated to any great extent. some are equipped for torpedo dropping while other types could drop depth chargesweighing 200 kilos, and are reputed to be equipped for spraying gas. Theexistence of a Trans-Ozean staffel of Ha. 139 twin-engined float planes has alsobeen reported, destined to carry out attacks against shipping on the West coast of Scotland. Moreover the He. 115 could carry 1,760 lbs. of bombs and could therefore be used as part of Germany &apos;s long range bomber force against ourcoasts and ports.
