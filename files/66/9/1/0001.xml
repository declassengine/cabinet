It Is requested that special care may bs mensure the secrecy of this   c r.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENT)SECRET.(UQ) gaSgw copy NO.t2UTE JUNE,  19UO.WAR CABINET.CONTRABAND CONTROL OP GOODS DESTINED FOR FRANCE,Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare.The signature of the French Armistice with Germanyraises immediate problems in connection with contraband control.      I take it that there can be no question but thatContraband Control should be exercised, so fa^ as possible,in respect of all ships destined for any port in the areaoccupied by Germany, that is any port in the Channel or on the atlantic seaboard,      I need not stress the importance, fromthe point of view of economic warfare, of making this control as effective as possible.      Further, the occupation of Franceby the enemy makes it even more important than before that effective control should be exercised off the coasts of spain and Portugal, which have hitherto been in the area patrolled*y the French Navy.2. I fully appreciate the practical difficulties involved,in present circumstances;  in arranging patrols for contraband control iDurposes off the Atlantic coasts of France, spain and Portugal.      Many difficult questions arise,  such as howfar constant patrols can be maintained and to what port shipsintercepted should be diverted.      It ma;- even be necessaryto consider whether an additional base could be obtained in Lisbon or the Azores.      I would sxiggest that these question should be urgently considered by the Admiralty,  in conjunctionwith my Department and with other Departments concerned..3. There is, however, one point on which I must ask fora decision from the War Cabinet at once for the guidance ofthe Contraband Committee,     The Committee propose to order thatall goods destined for that part of France which is underenemy occupation should be seized.      I feel sure that theWar Cabinet will approve this course,, In addition, the contraband Committee have asked for directions as regardsgoods for the unoccupied part of France,  since (unless thispoint is decided by the Italian armistice terms)  an immediate question arises over the treatment of the port of Marseilles.The Committee propose that goods for unoccupied France shouldbe treated in exactly the same way as those for the occupied territory as the German Armistice terms appear to makeit perfectly plain that any goods passing to Marseilles &quot;ould,in effect, be under German control.      The Committee therefore,suggest that the correct course is to treat France as being in effect and as a whole, territory which is intheoccupation of or under the control of the enemy.

1+. I fully concur in the course recommended by the contraband Committee;      But in view of the importance ofthe question, which clearly affects,  and may in part dependon, the relations, if any, which we are to have with theBordeaux Government j, I feel that I must ask the War Cabinetto give a decision upon it.      I hope that my colleagues will agree that the Contraband Committee&apos;s proposal should beadopted.      In the meantime,  ships destined for ports inunoccupied French territory are being detained;(Intd.)    H.D.Ministry of Economic Warfare.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.
