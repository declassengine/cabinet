THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT ------------   -- - -  138TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.C.O.S.(40)532). V COPY NO. JO4TH JULY, 1940.WAR CABINET,POLICY IN THE FAR EAST.Report &quot;by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.We are extremely apprehensive at the trend ofevents in the Far East.2. Now that France is no longer with us, and mayhe against us, avoidance of war with Japan is doublyimportant.     The War Cabinet are fully aware of our military weakness in the Far East and that we are not ina position to send a Fleet there in presentcircumstances.30 Sir R0 Craigie&apos;s telegram No. 1149 of th&amp;3rd July gives an indication of what mayhappen if we decline to make concessions to the Japanese,in particular with regard to the Burma road.     the ambassadors view is fully supported by the MilitaryAttach^ in Tokyo0  (Vide attached telegram +J,4* Foreign   Office    telegram    No. 634 to Tokyo,^which now awaits the comments of the Governments ofAustralia and New Zealand, proposes concessions, but, .in our opinion, these are not likely to settle thesituation in the Far East.5s We consider that if we are not in a positionto stand fast on all Japanese demands., accepting the riskcof war, we must go for a sufficiently wide settlement tosatisfy the Japanese.     We feel that to stand fast on all points would, in fact, bring us to war with Japan and wecannot, from the military point of view, recommend thiscourse.    The alternative, is, to make every endeavour to ol-earup the situation in the Far East as soon as possible ona wide basis.     We consider that in pursuing such a policy we should, in the long run, be serving the best interestsof Chiang Kai-Shek.6. It must also be remembered that we gave Australiaand New Zealand assurances that in the event of war with japan we should despatch a Fleet to the Far East.     Wehave now informed Australia and New Zealand that, in thepresent circumstances, we are unable to carry out this undertaking.     If, therefore, we adopt a policyin the Far East which may lead us to war with Japanfhaving at the same time informed our Dominions that we areunable to render xne assistance which we promised them,it seems to us extremely unlikely that Australia andNew Zealand will release any further forces for service overseas.+   Annex. $ not reproduced

7. To sum up, on military grounds we consider thatwe must avoid war with Japan and the best way of doing so will be to endeavour to reach a general settlement with the Japanese as soon as possible.(Signed)    C.

ANNEXFrom;-   Military Attache TokyoTo    :-   War OfficeDesp. 1533 3/7/40Reod.  1220 3/7/40278 cipher 3/7FIRST OF TWO PARTSYour 75305  (M.I.2)  2/7.Pro-German element in Army is in very strong position owing to German successes.    It is notpossible to say whether their strength is at presentso great that they can he termed out of hand &quot;but they arealready in a position to dictate policy so far as fightingservices are concerned and in event of an unfavourable-reply regarding Burma route their influence will be much increased and will be such that danger of war with uswill be much increased.I do not consider present situation can be compared to 26th February incident as latter was a purelydomestic matter involving only one small section of army,mostly junior officers.    We were at that time at peace in Europe and had good relations with Japan.   Presentsituation is one in which whole Nation, not only asmall section of Junior Army Officers, is interested and is connected with a foreign Nation i.e. ourselves.In my opinion the problem can be summarised asfollows:-   If we close Burma Road there is very littleanxiety of trouble with Japan.    If we refuse to close Burma Road it will mean running a real risk ofwar with Japan and will probably end in war becauseArmy is convinced that maintenance Burma route isprincipal obstacle to successful conclusion of war with china and refusal on our part to close road would greatlystrengthen hands of Army and of extremists generallythroughoiit Japan.

Prom: -Military Attach TokyoDesp. 1630 3/7/40To    :-   The War Office. Reed. 1320 3/7/40LAST PART.278 cipher 3/if we send an evasive answer I am doubtfulwhether majority of opinion in Japanese Army will accept and in any case this will mean relationswill quickly deteriorate and there will always belikelihood of incidents which will lead to war.As seen by me our position in Europe wouldseem to be such that we cannot run any risk of making any more enemies and that our obvious course is toavoid at all costs any risk of having Japanese Army,ITavy and Air Forces against us.   As long as Burma Roadremains open this risk, which is a very real one, will always be present.Ambassador requests view contained in this telegram with which he concurs,  should-be communicatedto Foreign Office.
