THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet. December 1942.SECRET. Copy No; -W.P. (42) 555.December 1, 1942.WAR CABINET.ALBANIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE time has in my opinion come when His Majesty&apos;s Government should announce that, in their view, Albania should be re-established as an independent state at the Peace Settlement, and I therefore propose, if my colleagues agree,to make a statement in the House of Commons at an early date in the termsof the Annex to this paper. The statement is confined to recognising the&apos;&apos; independence &apos;&apos; of Albania, nothing being said about restoring the pre-warboundaries in view of certain contingent territorial claims by the Greek andYugoslav Governments. Nor is any reference made to the restoration of KingZog to the Albanian throne.2. Albania was invaded and occupied by the Italians in April 1939. At thetime His Majesty&apos;s Government condoned the Italian annexation. On the19th June, 1940, soon after Italy&apos;s entry into the war, His Majesty&apos;s government announced that they regarded themselves as having regained their liberty of actionin respect of any degree of recognition which they had given to the Italianannexation of Albania. Thus since Italy entered the war the position has beenthat His Majesty&apos;s Government, while not having defined their attitude to thefuture of Albania, have been free to do so if desired.3. I need not burden my colleagues with an explanation of the arguments which have hitherto deterred me from suggesting that we should make adeclaration about the future of Albania. None of them was very strong, although in the aggregate they weighed against taking this step so long as there was no particular advantage to be gained from doing so.4.   The main arguments in favour of taking the step now are as follows : (a) We are now on the offensive in the Mediterranean, and a declarationabout the future of Albania would be interpreted in the Balkans as evidence of this offensive spirit.(6) It would be better to say what we have got to say about Albania now,while we are adopting a stern line towards Italy in our political warfare, rather than later when, if circumstances are favourable, itmay suit us to offer inducements to the Italians in order to underminetheir war effort.(c) A declaration recognising Albanian independence would lead to anincrease in resistance to the Italians in Albania, and would thus,increase the commitments of the Axis forces in the Balkans. S.O.E..consider that such a declaration would help them in their workamong the Albanian guerrillas. -5.   If it is found possible to bring together the Balkan States into aconfederation, Albania ought certainly to figure in such a confederation, and the. last sentence of my proposed statement is intended to cover this point.A. E.Foreign Office,December 1, 1942.[p.t.o.11914   [246821
. ANNEX.Question and Answer in Parliament.Question: To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he hasany statement to make on the subject of Albania.Answer: Yes, Sir. His Majesty&apos;s Government sympathise with the fate ofthe Albanians, a people among the earliest victims of Fascist aggression. they wish to see Albania freed from the Italian yoke and restored to her independence.The form of regime and government to be introduced into Albania will be a matter for the Albanian people themselves to decide at the end of the war.What I have said does not in any way prejudge the question of Albania&apos;position in relation to such future arrangements as may be reached between the-various Balkan States.
