MOST SECRET.FIRST PART.Following for Prime Minister from Field Marshal Smuts.Most Secret and Personal       This is a Most Secret Telegram.After arrival this morning I had a long talk withEisenhower and Cunningham, which I summarise for yourinformation,     as regards coming operation next Sundayor Monday it is doubtful whether Anderson is strong enoughto take. Bizerta but Tunis appears more hopeful.      In anyeaau   every effort will be made to press enemy into as smallan area or bridgehead as possible so that air and otherattack may finish hfir. later-.     Further south attempt will bemade to clean up small pockets of enemy at Sfax and else-where, but no large forces will be employed in Tripolidirection at present--     Sea losses so far have been madegoode      Loss of personnel ships have been compensated byequal number of French ships acquired, and for everymerchant vessel lost a U-boat has been sunk.     As regardsDarlan statements published have had unsettling effect on local French leaders and it would be dangerous to go further on those lines.      Nogues has threatened to resign and as hecontrols Morocco population results of such a step mightbe far reaching.      From point of view of securing french -operation and stabilising situation nothing could be worse than impression that we were merely using leaders to discardthem as soon as they have served our purpose.      There can beno doubt that Darlan and his friends have burnt their boats and are doing their best to fight the Axis and consolidateFrench behind us in this fighto      French are co-operating in non-combatant tasks and even in fighting on small scale,but their fighting value is at present low for want of&quot;proper armso     Darlan was not Eisenhower1s choice but thatof other French leaders some of whom were his enemies andour strong supporters and who all agreed that his leadershipin co-operation was essential for our operations.      It wouldbe great mistake to create impression that he is to bediscarded at early date      Military situation may call forhis retiGPtjon for fairly long period and meanwhile impressionto contrary should not be publicly createdo&apos;SECOJIP^ AND LAST PART.I explained to Eisenhower that I do not think therewas any intention to repeat or go beyond statements already made which were only intended to correct impression thattolitical accord with Vichy elements had been eome to.ut.urcl- arrangements should be left&quot; to governmentsQ.near-nod and agreement of Fr^ncn. among thcinseives,-     Ithink it would be wise to pass on to President Roosevelt raystrong impression that further anti-Darlan statements mightbe harmful to our cause, and indeed are not called for.   Weleave late this af ernoon and I shall signal you again fromCairo0      Your company and talks last night were a greathonour and most deeply enjoyed.      Thanks Very much.T.0.0.  1445A/20C,6 (Telegrams)

Ref. No. 928.       19th Nov. 1942.EDITED LITERAL TEXT.I can not emphasize too strongly the needfor speed in arriving at an early decision on ProtocolNo* 1,   I have Just received a report from Clark to theeffect that orders issued by Darlan during last 4 days,combined (with a ?) tour by Giraud, have had excellent results on French troops in Tunisia and have galvanizerthem into action.What I saw with my own eyes at Casablancato-day confirms the reports of all my commanders thatthe French are making a real contribution in unloadingconvoys and moving troops and stores by rail to the forward areas in Tunisia.   I value this aid more thanthe active participation of their troops.I am very concerned lest any delay in approving the Protocol should lead Darlan and hiscolleagues to relax their efforts at this very criticastage.   We are doing our utmost to prevent this.   our success in the battle about to stair, in Tunisia maydepend upon it.(Relayed to AGWAR 200102Z).Circulation.E0?ig.* Jacob.Foreign Secretary.First Sea Lord.C.6, Telegrams, War Office.A.M.C.S.
