PROPOSALS FOR THE REFORM OF THEFOREIGN SERVICE.INTBODUCTION.IN a statement in the House of Commons on the 11th June, 1941, theSecretary of State . for Foreign Affairs announced the intention ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government to introduce a series of reforms, designed tocreate a combined Foreign Service distinct from the Home Civil Service, tobroaden the field of- entry into the new Service, and to increase its efficiencyby facilitating the retirement on pension of men who prove unfitted for thehighest posts. Reforms so wide in their scope cannot all be operative until after the war. Nevertheless, the interest of Parliament in the proposedreforms has been great, and it has been decided to submit a broad outline,necessarily incomplete and liable, perhaps, to modification in detail, of theproposals for a new Foreign Service and, in particular, to seek forthwithParliamenfs approval of a Pensions Bill for the purpose to which theForeign Secretary alluded in his. statement.2. Among the criticisms which have been brought against the diplomatic service the view has been expressed that it is&quot; recruited from too small acircle, that it tends to represent the interests of certain sections of thenation rather than those of the country as a whole, that its members leadtoo sheltered a life, that they have insufficient understanding of economicand social questions, that the extent of their experience is too small toenable them properly to understand many of the problems with which they ought to deal, and that the range of their contacts is too limited to allow them to acquire more than a relatively narrow acquaintance with the foreignpeoples amongst whom they live.3. These criticisms are generally overstated and some of them have their origin in a misunderstanding of the functions of the Diplomatic Service.The principal function of a diplomat is to be the channel of communication between His Majesty&apos;s Government and foreign Governments and torepresent the United Kingdom in the country where he is posted. He isnot himself directly responsible for the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.That is decided by the Cabinet at home; and the art of diplomacy is theart of making that policy, whatever it may be, understood and, if possible,accepted by other countries. The diplomat also has to keep His Majesty&apos;sGovernment informed on all developments of importance in or relating tothe country in question and to submit his observations and advice, whichmay or may not be accepted. However, the conditions which the diplomatic service originally grew up to meet no longer exist unchanged in moderninternational affairs. Economics and finance are inextricably interwovenwith politics; an understanding of social problems and labour movementsis indispensable in forming a properly balanced judgment of world events.The modern diplomat should have a more intimate understanding of these special problems and greater opportunities to study them than he hasusually possessed in the past. By introducing the reforms hereinafterdescribed it is intended to re-equip the Foreign Service to meet modern conditions and to create a Service which, by its composition, by the recruit-ment and training of its members and by its organisation, shall be better
able not merely to represent the interests of the nation as a whole, but alsoto deal with the whole range of international affairs, political, social andeconomic, and so constitute an adequate instrument for the maintenanceof good relations and mutual understanding between the United Kingdomand other countries.4. It is a fact, too, that the efficiency of the Foreign. Service has sufferedin the-past from the lack of flexibility which arises from the disparity in conditions of service as between posts at home and posts abroad. Conditionsof service in the Foreign Office have been assimilated to those of the home civil Service. Members of the Diplomatic Service who are posted abroad, onthe other hand, have been treated on a different basis in regard to conditionsof service, pension rights, &amp;c. The Secretary of State has not been free, inpractice, to move a man from a mission abroad to a post in the ForeignOffice without consideration of the effect which such a transfer might haveupon the individual concerned. The efficiency of the Service has undoubtedlysuffered in consequence. The new Foreign Service, accordingly, will be entirely -separated from the Home Civil Service and will be treated as a self-contained and distinct service of the Crown.5. In this new Foreign Service the present distinction between theForeign Office und Diplomatic Service, the Commercial Diplomatic Serviceand the Consular Service will disappear. All future entrants will join a combined Foreign Service and all will receive similar training not merely inlanguages and history ,but also in economic and commercial affairs. Thesystem of recruitment will be recast so as to facilitate the ,entry, from anysocial sphere, of candidates with suitable qualifications by enabling them toobtain the necessary vocational training at the expense of the State., Uniformity of career for all will be impossible and is, indeed, undesirable, forsome men will prove more fitted &quot;for work in the Foreign Office and in diplo-matic- posts and others for commercial or consular work. What is aimed at 12 wider training and equality of opportunity for all. Every member of theService will be called upon to serve in consular and commercial diplomaticas well as in diplomatic posts and in the Foreign Office and all will havethe opportunity of rising to the highest posts. Interchange between thedifferent branches, as between posts at home and those abroad, will be facilitated with the object of giving every man as wide an experience. aspossible and &quot; of enabling the best man to be sent to any vacant post.This will involve some adjustment of the present disproportion in thenumbers of the diplomatic and consular posts and a regrading of certainposts at home and abroad.6. The effects of the new system of recruitment and training whichis contemplated will not, of course, be felt for some years after its introduction. On the cessation of hostilities, however, the new Service -will be faced with a problem which i will demand an immediate solution.For a number of years there will have been no new entry. At the top of the Service there will be men who have stayed at their posts duringthe war against their inclination and who will wish to retire to make room for younger men. The Foreign Service will be understaffed whilethe tasks which &quot;face it will have multiplied. It will be necessary,therefore, to make special arrangements for- recruitment pending theintroduction of the new system of recruitment and training described below. A scheme of special entry to meet the demands of the Service(luring the reconstruction period immediately after the war is now-beingworked out. It is probable that, as happened after the last war, such ascheme will have to be based primarily on the candidate&apos;s record of
service during the war and on his showing before an interviewing boardrather than on a written examination or academic qualifications. It willbe desirable, too, that the scheme should cover, as far as possible, thoseage groups which, but. for the war, would have been represented in theService to-day. .&apos;      , :7. The proposed reforms would be incomplete and perhaps ineffectil,if they did not extend to the subordinate ranks upon whom the efficientperformance of the work of the Service must largely depend. At presentmembers of the subordinate branches in the Foreign Office do not belong to the Foreign Service. Either they form part of the Home Civil service or they are temporarily recruited at home or abroad. - Those who are members of the Home Civil Service are not, liable for service abroadalthough, they can and do volunteer for it, and those recruited locally on anunestablished basis are not pensionable. This system is objectionable from every point of view. To rely to any large extent upon unestablished and non-pensionable elements does not make for efficiency and is unfair :to those concerned. It is not intended to cease employing locally recruited staffwhere this is required in posts abroad, but it is most undesirable thatconfidential papers should be handled by those who are not members ofthe Service and whose interests are not bound up with it. Finally, thefact that essential services in the Foreign Office are not part of the foreign service creates an artificial division between the various branches of theService, and between home and foreign posts, which restricts free inter-change of personnel and hampers efficiency and the development of thatesprit de corps which must exist in any healthy organisation. It has beendecided, therefore, that the subordinate ranks shall be brought; into theForeign Service, that opportunities for promotion shall be made availablebetween the subordinate branches and the senior branch, and that all members of the Foreign Service, of whatever branch, shall be established and therefore pensionable, and under obligation to serve abroad or at homeas required.8. It is necessary to emphasise that, in the Foreign Service, a great measure of direct personal responsibility rests on senior officers, especiallyabroad. Experience has shown that some men, who are entirely satisfactory in the early years of their service, either do not fulfil their promise orlose the qualities of initiative and energy which are necessary if they areto hold positions of greater responsibility. It is therefore essential thatthe Foreign Secretary should be able to terminate, by retirement on pension, the careers of men who, though they may have been excellentsubordinates, are unsuited to fill the highest posts. This practice has, to1fact, been usual in the Armed Forces. It will be necessary to grant tosuch men, who will have given many of the best years of their lives tothe public service, pensions sufficient to keep them from poverty and to mark the fact that no disgrace is implied by their retirement.9. Being liable to spend a large part of their lives abroad and being subject to transfer between London and posts abroad, members of theForeign Service, of all branches, will be involved in a good deal of expensewhich does not fail on home civil servants, who can count on spendingtheir careers in this country and are able to plan their lives on a long-term basis. Grants will accordingly be necessary to compensate officers, whohave served abroad, for any extra expense arising from their transfer tothe United Kingdom. Officers serving abroad must be ensured emolumentssufficient to enable them not only to represent this country effectively butalso to form a wide range of contacts. The effective representation ofthis  country abroad will,  moreover, involve the provision of adequate
Government buildings for Missions and Consulates, as well as adequatestaffs, and it will be essential, after the war, to remember that economieson buildings and staffs are false economies if they result in impairedefficiency or in reduced security for confidential papers. Arrangements willbe made for the more efficient administration of the Service, for theI spection of all posts abroad and for the maintenance of &quot;fuller recordsqh which to base recommendations to the Secretary of State forappointments, transfers or retirements on pension.10. These reforms will cost money. But the additional expense will bea very small price to pay for a thoroughly efficient Foreign Service such as can contribute appreciably to the avoidance of international conflict. It isin the hope of creating such a Service that it is proposed to introduce the reforms which are summarised in greater detail below.-   summaby of proposed befobms.I. Amalgamation of the Services and Regrading of Posts,11. After the last war the Foreign Office was amalgamated with the diplomatic Service, but the Commercial Diplomatic and Consular Servicesremained separate, and the Foreign Office was still regarded as part of theHome Civil Service. The result was that the free interchange betweenposts of different types, which is essential if all men. are to get the widertraining and experience that are so desirable, and if the best man is to he made available for any particular post, was hindered, and members of theCommercial Diplomatic and Consular Services were only in exceptional cases able to reach the highest &quot;posts. In the new Service most men willhave to spend the greater part of their oareers abroad, and&apos; the Foreign Office-will in future be regarded as one of the posts and as the headquarters oi theForeign Service, rather than as a department&quot; of the Home Civil Service.The amalgamation of the separate Services info one oomplete and indepen-dent Foreign Service will, it is believed, broaden-the training (in its fullestsense) by combining knowledge oi economic,; industrial and shipping affairs with practical experience of dealing with the public and the Press and withthe wider appreciation of International relations whieh is the  eld ofdiplomacy. The functions of diplomatic officers accredited to a foreign government must continue in many respects to differ from those of consular officers. The number of.. consular posts must continue to exceed that of diplomatic posts. But the maintenance of the present disparity between ithenumbers of the diplomatic and the consular posts would make an effectiveamalgamation Impossible. . It would mean that if there were to. be anyequality of conditions of service all men&apos; would obtain a predominantlyconsular experience and training.. This -would be to the detriment &quot;of. thepolitical work of the Service. It will, therefore, be necessary to increase thenumber of diplomatic officers and to reduce the number of consular officers.It will in any case be necessary to increase the size of the dijifamatic staffs ifMissions abroad are to be strong enough to make our influence more widelyfelt, and if officers, being no longer tied to their deslss, vare to &quot;be enabled toExtend the range of their&quot; contacts. New arrangements will be made forstaffing consular posts of lesser importance, and, by regrouping andreorganising posts ;and making use of: improved communications by air,adequate and effective ^consular representation will he ensured&apos;12. By facilitating the transfer to *the &quot;Foreign -Office oi senior men of experience, more effective interchange of officers between posts at home andabroad will become .&apos;the rule so that Foreign &apos;.Service men can keep In touch&quot;with developments at home and the Secretary of State will be enabled to[24543] &quot; b 2
employ the most suitable man at any particular post at home or abroadThis will involve the provision of similar salaries for men of similar rankwhether they are employed at home or in foreign posts; it will also involve an increase in the number of posts at home and the upgrading of posts in the Foreign Office which carry responsibilities greater than should properly devolve on men of the rank now attaching to them. Furthermo; \it is desirable to improve the prospects of promotion in the juniorgrades of the Foreign Service and to upgrade the status of certain consularand commercial diplomatic posts of incontestable importance in order thatthey may be held by men of the experience and standing which the postsmerit.H.-Recruitment and Training.13. In the conduct of international affairs much depends upon the personal relations which a foreign representative succeeds in establishingwith the Government and people of the country concerned. In the choice ofmen for the Foreign Service particular attention must therefore be paid tothe personality and character of the candidates while ensuring that theypossess the intellectual capacity and knowledge necessary for their career.This knowledge can with difficulty be acquired without special study such asto-day requires the assistance of private means. This requirement places a limitation on the field of selection of candidates which cannot be accepted.The new scheme of recruitment and training will therefore consist of a preliminary competitive entrance test designed so that it can be taken without special study, followed by a period of training abroad at the expenseof the State. At the end of this studentship period candidates will be examined in their special subjects, and, if they qualify, will become membersof the Foreign Service. They will then undergo a year&apos;s training in thiscountry, part of which will be spent in the Foreign Office and part-in getting a grounding in economic, commercial and social questions. - The presentpreliminary Foreign Office Selection Board will be abolished.14. The entrance examination will thus be taken in two parts. Thefirst will be taken between the ages of 21 and 23, and the majority of thevacancies will be filled by means of an open competitive examination(Method 1). While it is not considered that an entry based upon selectionalone would ensure that candidates possess the necessary intellectualqualities, it is proposed, as an experimental measure, that candidates for a proportion of the vacancies should be chosen by a method based mainly onselection (Method 2).15. For those who compete by Method 1 there will be an opencompetitive examination conducted by the Civil Service Commission andso designed that candidates will be able to take it shortly after theirUniversity degree examination and without special study. (Althoughdesigned for those who have studied at a. University in this country, the examination will be open, as at present, to candidates who have notattended a&apos; University.) This examination will be similar-to that for theHome and Indian Civil Services in order that candidates may compete forall or. any of the Services and that a larger number of candidates may therefore be encouraged to compete.16. Method 2 is designed to attract candidates who might be discouraged at having to sit for another examination immediately after that for their degree and to enable due weight to be given to the claims of character and personality as distinct from mere ability to pass writtenexaminations. For an experimental period of ten years candidates for not more than 25 per cent, of the annual vacancies will be chosen mainly
u selection on the basis of. their records, of their showing before an&apos;interview board (at which they will be required to reach a really highualifying standard), and of a written examination in the English subjectsjornpulsory for Method 1.   Candidates who compete by this method willbe required to have reached a certain academic standard.   A candidate will  s^free to compete by either or both of these Methods in the same year.17. Candidates who compete succesfully by either method will begiven travelling studentships from public funds for 18 months in order that,under due supervision, they may study at least two languages abroad,together with history -and economics, and acquire the necessary, familiaritywith life in countries other than their own.18. The second part of the examination will be held at the end of thestudentship period when candidates will have to pass a qualifyingexamination in the subjects studied during that period. In each part ofthe examination candidates will have to qualify at an interview before a board constituted by the Civil Service Commission with Foreign Servicerepresentation. The object of these interviews will be to assess the&apos;candidate^ personal suitability for the Foreign Service.19. Candidates who qualify will become members of the Foreign Servicesubject to one year&apos;s probationary period of work in this country. Half ofthis; period will be spent in, the Foreign Office. The other halfwill be spent in the study of economic, commercial and industrialquestions in other Government Departments dealing with these affairs andin visiting centres of industry or in other suitable ways. The period will include study of labour questions. This training is not aimed at producingexperts in economic and social questions but at ensuring that all membersof the new Service have a good general understanding of such matters anda foundation on which to build up specialised knowledge if necessary. Atthe end of this period men will be posted to Missions and Consulates abroad.20. Provision will be made for ensuring an adequate supply of men forposts in oriental countries. The importance of a knowledge of oriental aswell as of Latin and Slavonic languages and the need for ensuring that alljuniors have as wide an experience as possible will be borne in mind in thetraining period and in the posting of men in the early years of their service.21. The provision made for the training of candidates in economic and commercial affairs and the fact that all men will be liable to serve in commercial diplomatic and consular as well as political posts, should ensurethat all members of the Service possess at least a general knowledge and understanding of ordinary economics and of commercial practice. It is felt that, in these circumstances, the appointment to Missions abroad of expert advisers in commercial affairs from outside the Service may be unnecessary and might, indeed, be undesirable since it would imply thatthese questions were outside the province of the Foreign Service officer.It is hoped, therefore, that the general level of ability and training ofmembers of the Service will be such that none of them will feel obligedto make any essential part of their work the exclusive province of .experts.This will not, however, preclude the appointment of expert advisers on commercial, social, agricultural or other matters when this is clearly inthe public interest.22. In order to facilitate understanding of questions of strategy and imperial defence, as Well as to promote close contact with the service departments, it is hoped to make arrangements whereby members of theForeign Service can be attached to the Imperial Defence College in larger numbers than before the war.
miitary. Conditions of Service at Home.23. Most. members of the Service will spend the greater part of theiicareers abroad, sometimes in distant and unhealthy posts. Their situationmust, therefore, be considered not as that of men employed in this eountrvwho may occasionally be posted away from home, hut rather - as thai&apos;1men who spend most of their careers abroad and are only occasionally postedat home. At present, when transferred to the Foreign Office, Foreign Servicemen are subjected not only to personal inconvenience but also to distinctfinancial disadvantages. Thus, they normally incur considerable indirectexpenditure over their transfer, while the comparatively short: period forwhich they may be kept in this country and the uncertainty of their futuremovements makes it necessary for them to plan their lives on a short-term basis. They thus incur greater expenditure over housing, the education ofchildren, &amp;&apos;c, than officials who reside permanently in this country and can plan their future with greater certainty. Moreover, - Foreign service officers posted to London should not, if they are to do their work properly,be obliged, through lack of means, to cut themselves off from contact with,foreign representatives or from those wider contacts which are necessary ifthey are to be effective representatives of this country when they go abroadagain.24. While it is not suggested that the Foreign Service man at head-quarters should be required to lead the same representative life as hiscolleague abroad, it would clearly be inequitable if, as a result of theconditions under which he serves, he were placed in a worse financialposition than members of the Home Civil Service. If assistance from public funds is to be given to enable men without private means to compete for the new Service, in order that the basis of recruitment maybe widened, it is clearly necessary that such men should be able to liveon their emoluments when once they are in the Service, whether abroador at home. This they will be unable to do if full account is not taken of their special circumstances.25.   It is accordingly proposed that members of the Foreign service should be paid a special grant on transfer to London.IV. Administration.26. For the administration of the new Service it is proposed to appoint an additional Deputy Under-Secretary of State in the Foreign Office to relieve the Permanent Under-Secretary of administrative and non-politicalwork. Under this officer all questions concerning appointments in theService will be handled by a Personnel Department which will keepsystematic records of every member of the Service based on reports andon personal contacts. Regular inspection of consular posts is already the rule; it will henceforth be applied to diplomatic Missions as well. the personnel Department will furnish information for the Promotions board which will advise the Secretary of State on the higher appointments. Toadvise the Foreign Secretary in cases. of retirement on pension beforethe age of 60, it is. proposed to establish a special board under the chair-manship of a former senior member of the Service.V. Superannuation Bill..27. With improved arrangements for the entry and training of jcandidates for the Foreign Service and the establishment of morelsystematic machinery for making appointments, cases of men being found 1)
unsuitable for service in the highest ranks should, in future, be rare.   Iti however, necessary for the reasons stated in paragraph 8 that theforeign Secretary should, now and in the future, have  the power  to terminate, by retirement on pension before the normal age of 60, the servicesijLmen of the rank of First Secretary or its equivalent and upwards, who,Jfjgh they have committed no fault meriting dismissal, are unsuited forjts of the highest responsibility and cannot be found other employment in Government service.   At present the Foreign Secretary has not thisJjower.   He is able only to place men on the unemployed list, leavinghem without pay or pension, and is therefore subject to considerableiressure to employ a man even though he feels that he is unsuitable.   ItBias accordingly been decided to submit to Parliament a Bill which will give,he Foreign Secretary the necessary powers and will provide for suitablempensation. &apos;28. The present Bill is., aimed at meeting only the immediate needsof the Service. It will be replaced after the war by a comprehensive&apos;oreign Service Superannuation Bill designed to meet the,needs of the newforeign Service. The comprehensive Bill will have not only to ensure to theSecretary of State the power&apos;to terminate on pension the services of menunfit for the highest posts but also to remove certain anomalies whichesult in unequal treatment, to revise the basis on which the pensions of theforeign Service have hitherto been calculated and to make suitable provisionfor the pensions of members of the subordinate branches of the Service.&apos;he necessary legislation will be submitted to Parliament as soon as possible(after the war.VI. Subordinate Staff.29. For the reasons given in paragraph 7 it is intended that the new[Foreign Service shall include not only the Diplomatic, CommercialDiplomatic and Consular Services but also the subordinate branches. All[members of the new Service will be pensionable and will be liable for servicefeoad as well as at home. Being liable for service abroad the subordinatelimbers of &apos;the Service will be subject to the same extra expense,Resulting from transfer to London as well&apos; as from uncertainty of tenurethome, as members of the senior branch. It is therefore intended that theyfehould receive, on transfer to the Foreign Office, grants comparable to(those payable to the latter.30. In addition to the higher posts which will be available in theinordinate branches themselves, it is also proposed that subordinatetoployees of exceptional merit shall be considered with other candidatesmpeting for posts in the senior branch by Method 2 (see paragraph 16).ftwision will further be made for the promotion of more senior men, whoproved their suitability, to posts in the senior branch.VII. Admission of Women.31. Women are not at present eligible for posts in the administrativertanch of the Foreign Office or in the Diplomatic, Commercial Diplomaticf Consular Services. For the duration of the war, all regular entry into thelervice is suspended. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has,lowever, already announced his readiness to regard the report of theommittee, which, in 1934, examined the question of the admission ofromen into the- Foreign Service, as no longer necessarily being the last&apos;ord on the subject, and to consider, after the war, the appointment of a
Committee, which will not be confined in its composition to members ofthe Civil Service, to review the question again in the light of the existingcircumstances. In the subordinate branches of the Service women willcontinue to be employed.      /CONCLUSION. - )32. &quot;The problems dealt with by the Foreign Service are far-reaching.They often involve issues of peace and war and cither national interests ofthe greatest importance. The results of a mistake or even of inadequacymay involve a costly disaster. Diplomacy is but one of the weapons ofwhich His Majesty&apos;s Government dispose for the&apos; protection of Britishinterests. It is, however, a weapon which, if effective, may makeunnecessary the resort to other weapons. His Majesty&apos;s Government believethat the proposed reforms the most important heads of which are summarised above will materially contribute to render the-Foreign Servicemore effective, and they therefore trust that the proposals will meet withthe approval of Parliament.-iwt.- 72 11/42 f.o.p. 24543 gp. 340
