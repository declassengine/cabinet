(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)        171S SORE TW.P. (42) 55027th November, 1942REPORT ON HOME OPINIONMemorandum by the Minister of InxomationThe period which I am reviewing covers the weeks before and after the arrival of the news of the 8th Arrays victory and of the occupation of Moroccoand Algeria.     This news has so deeply affected the course *f public feeling   -that I can pass over the earlier part of the period in a few words.2,     It was a time of apparent inactivity, and accordingly the feeling of thepublic was restless and in minor ways dissatisfied.     The defence of Stalingrad,was the main feature of the war and admiration for Russian tenacity wassupplemented by a sense of disquiet that we were not apparently engaged insome comparable achievement.     Out of this inevitably arose some lack ofconfidence and a sensitiveness to homo-front problems that did not promise wellfor.the wintor.J.     who news of victory in North Africa has, of course, been a fine stimulant.The public were quick to realise that the news of what we were doing was beingconservatively handled and they were avowedly grateful for the restraint.Indeed, it has been instructive to note how reluctant many people have been toaccept oven an achieved victory at its face value.     The people of this country have been sternly conditioned by three years of war in which they have under-gone many disappointments, and thoy are now as suspicious as the ancient Greeksof any exultation- that seems to challenge fate,     Observing this, I do not thinkthat there is any danger of complacency or over-optimism that we need set out to check, J4*     The decision to ring the church bells in celebration of General Alexander1svictory was received with an awed disquiet.     Approval and disapproval were fairly evena     But I would venture the guess that there wore many who, havingsatisfied their sense of fitness by entering a protest, welcomed with aquickening delight the actual sound of the pealing bells,5*    A special feature of the satisfaction that the public have derived fromthe North African operations is shown in their praise for the elaborate andco-ordinated planning that made the operations successful.     Both in Libya andin North Africa the General Staff has come into its own.     This is of somesignificance for the future:   for, although the public havo never allowedthemselves to doubt the fighting qualities of our soldiers, except at momentsof consternation such as followed the fall of Singapore and Tobruk, they hadunquestionably come to wonder whether we should ever display the capacity for large and co-ordinated planning with which thoy credited our enemies.     Sostriking a demonstration of our capacity in this field has been received with, -real delight;   and the effects are likely to,spread beyond the area of militaryoperations and supply,6,    Lastly, there is the incident of General Montgomery and General Von Thoma,This incident, trifling in itself, roused an altogether disproportionate amountof comment and, without exception, of disapproval.     General Montgomery remained the hero of the hour;   but that he should entertain a German General to dinnerand allow himself to be photographed receiving him appears to have struck theWAR    CABINET9CpPY NO,     ^ fa/home
homo public as symptomatic of an attitude which they fear and resent:    &quot;let usall shake hands now. that it is over&quot;.      Naturally, I only refer to the incident because of its significant relation to a phase&quot; of public feeling.7.     The controversy about the chaining of prisoners of war became for weokg \a subject of interest second in importance only to Stalingrad,     The course Jfeeling was clearly defined.     Once the distinction between &quot;tying prisoners&apos;&apos;&apos;hands in the course of operations and tying  them in actual captivity had beenmade clear it was immediately accepted.     The first reaction to tho Germanreprisal announcement was preponderantly in favour of retaliation.     support for this attitude waned steadily in succeeding weeks and the argument &quot;wocan&apos;t compote with the Germans on this&quot; seems to have, gained very general acceptance.     For the time being, however, interest has died down.Bo Bo27th November. 1942.
