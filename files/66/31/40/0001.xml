., n Jthis document is the property of his britannic majesty*s governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) S60.December 1, 1942.WAR CABINET.REFORM OF THE FOREIGN SERVICE.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE draft White Paper which the Foreign Secretary has circulated with his memorandum (W.P. (42) 538) has been discussed in detail between the treasury and the Foreign Office. Those discussions have taken place within the ambit ofthe Cabinet decision of the 2nd June, 1941, and on that basis substantial agree-rnent has been reached, although there are one or two points to which I draw theattention of my colleagues in paragraphs 6 and 7 of this memorandum.2. I must confess, however, that I have always viewed with misgiving thatcomplete separation of the Foreign from the Home Service which appeared toflow from the approval given by the Cabinet in June 1941, to the recommenda-tions made by Sir Malcolm Robertson. There is, therefore, much in the HomeSecretary&apos;s memorandum (W.P. (42) 554) with which I agree. In particular, Ishare his view that, even if the Foreign Service is to be separated entirely fromthe Home Service, there ought to be arrangements for interchange of personnelbetween the two Services. It is, I am sure, generally agreed that the Home CivilService has benefited to a substantial degree from the current practice of transfersat all levels between Departments. Further. extension of the practice appears tome to be both desirable and inevitable in the years after the war.3. The Foreign Secretary will no doubt be able to reassure the HomeSecretary that retirement from the Foreign Service before the normal retiring ageis contemplated only at the option of the State. As regards the Home Secretary&apos;question in paragraph 5 of his memorandum about the possibility of applyingsimilar provisions to the higher ranks of the Home Civil Service, I agree that weshall need to be ready to answer this point in Parliament.4. My own view is that, as part of the post-war adjustment of conditionsin the Home Civil Service, we shall need to consider the adoption of a plan of earlier retirement somewhat similar to that now proposed for the Foreign Service.A good deal of thought has already been given to this question in the Treasury,but many problems arise which do not apply in the case of the Foreign Service;for example, any scheme designed to facilitate earlier retirement from the home civil Service would have to apply to all ranks, and the Staff Side would almost certainly press for safeguards, by way of Appeal Tribunals or otherwise, which do not figure in the Foreign Service scheme. Be that as it may, however, promulgated-gation of general powers of this kind for the Home Service would to-day beill-timed. There is no surplus in the higher ranks of the Home Service such asexists for special reasons in the&apos; Foreign Service. Indeed, the whole emphasisboth at this moment and very probably also during the transitional period from war to peace must be on the need for retention rather than oh the need for retire-ment. Man-power considerations must, I suggest, form the basis of any statement to be made in public.5. As regards the White Paper itself, one may reasonably expect that these plans, when published, will provoke a considerable amount of discussion andcriticism, and, while much of that criticism will, in any case, be destructive andunhelpful,  there will no  doubt be a considerable  amount of constructive[24689]
suggestion which we should, I suggest, do well to consider before finally com-mitting ourselves to any cut-and-dried scheme. I am aware that the proposals ofthe White Paper are described in its first paragraph as &quot; a broad outline, neces-sarily incomplete and liable, perhaps, to modification in detail,&quot; but I am stilldoubtful whether it would be right for the Foreign Secretary or the government at this stage to accept final responsibility for a detailed scheme of reform before we have had an opportunity of ascertaining the reactions of the public and parliament. I suggest, therefore, that the White Paper be presented to Parlia-ment rather as a basis for discussion than as the Governments last word on thematter.6. Turning to the details of the White Paper, I would invite the attention ofmy colleagues to the sentence at the top of page 6, which states that &quot; this will involve the provision of similar salaries for men of similar rank whether theyare employed at home or in foreign posts.&quot; This would mean, for example, thatthe present Assistant Under-Secretaries of State in the Foreign Office (equivalentto Principal Assistant Secretaries in the Home Service) would have their salariesincreased from  1,700 per annum to  2,000 per annum to bring them up to thelevel of Ministers in the Diplomatic Service abroad. The Foreign Secretary haspressed this proposal on me on the grounds of interchangeability between postsabroad and comparable posts at home. I have gone a long way to meet him. Ihave agreed that no obstacle should be placed in the way of interchangeabilityand that if, under the new regime, the Foreign Secretary wishes to bring home a minister to fill a post of Assistant Under-Secretary of State in the Foreign Office,the Minister shall continue to receive his former salary on a personal basis so thathe does not suffer from the transfer. Again, I have agreed to the reference alittle later on in the same paragraph of the White Paper to the upgrading of posts in the Foreign Office, but I have not been prepared to agree to fix now aparticular salary in a Whitehall office to apply after the war. Such a decision, i suggest, must wait until we are able to review the general level of remuneration of Crown servants of all kinds after the war. Even if there is to be completeassimilation of the Diplomatic Service and the Foreign Office staff, we must have some regard to the level of salaries paid in similar Departments of State in whitehall, and I note that this is implicitly accepted by the Foreign secretary in paragraph 24 of the White Paper when he argues that the Foreign Service manin London should not be placed in a worse financial position than members of theHome Civil Service. I suggest the deletion from paragraph 12 of the sentence towhich I have drawn attention.7. Similarly in paragraph 28, although the proposal for a further foreign service Superannuation Bill after the war would seem to flow naturally from theCabinet decision of the 2nd June, 1941, I am doubtful whether we ought to announce anything further at this stage about a measure which has not yet received proper examination outside the Foreign Office itself, and I would suggestthat this paragraph might with advantage be deleted from the White Paper.K. W.Treasury Chambers, December 1, 1942.
