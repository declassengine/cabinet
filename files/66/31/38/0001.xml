Large fires,were reported on the first night, when 62 Lancasters attacked and, according to the Italian communique, substantial damage was caused.Nevertheless, photographs show that the attack was concentrated on the Easternend of the city, which is comparatively uninflammable. The attack cannot,therefore, be called a success.On the following night a force of 135 aircraft attacked the city again;preliminary reports indicate that good results were obtained. The Italiancommunique, published the following morning, stated : -&quot;A. new raid on Genoa took place.last night, when air formationsbombed in relays; the city and the port. Damage is huge. The number ofvictims has not yet been established.&quot;Information regarding Previous Raids.Genoa (22nd/23rd October).4. Photographs (Prints 1-6) show that over an area of about 77 acres morethan half the buildings have been destroyed or very seriously damaged. Thedestruction is mainly due to fire, and is well concentrated in the most congestedpart of the city.The Ansaldo fitting-out yards have been badly hit and a number of largedockside warehouses destroyed.The Stazione Brignole (East Railway Station) appears to have been almost completely destroyed, and the Stazione CaricamentO (Dock Branch Station) hasbeen damaged.According to reports from ground sources, the two liners, Roma andAugustus, both of over 30,000 tons, were damaged. The former (which is being,converted to an aircraft carrier) was hit in two places; the damage, however,is repairable. The latter was more severely hit, and it is possible that attempts to repair her may have to be given up.Milan (24th October).5.   Milan has not been photographed since the attack, but the Italian pressstated that there were 30 major and 300 minor fires in the city.Rail dislocation was. serious: (i) The Greco railway station was severely damaged.   No trains had reached Zurich up to noon of the 26th October.   Dislocation of this,    line, which is electrified, will seriously affect Italy&apos;s coal imports from..*,.,,      the Saar and Ruhr.   .(ii).. The main line at Lambrate is known to have been blocked for 24 hours,causing a suspension of all traffic Eastwards to Verona and Venice and.\    Southwards to Bologna and Genoa.(iii) The main station suffered slight damage from a bomb which fell inthe square facing the main entrance.(iv) The Genoa railway station was hit.Damage in residential and business areas is stated to have been most severe in theVia Monforte (East of the main station), in the Porta Genoa, the Porta Ticineseareas, the Corso.Buenos Aires and the Piazza Bacorii.Industrial damage included the Pirelli Rubber Works and Tyre depot.
After the first raid on Genoa, many of the inhabitants of Milan left thecity in panic, and part of the Milan fire services was called on to assist at Genoa.The difficulties of dealing; with, the results of the attack on. Milan were therebygreatly increased. - .Le Creusot (17th October).6. Apart from the attack on the works themselves, the Henri Paultransformer and switching station at Montchanin was the subject of specialattack by a small part of the force. A reliable ground source states that it was so damaged by direct hits that after the attack no power whatever could reach the works. Consequently all production was stopped, and without power forcranes, gantries and other electrical services, repair and salvage work will be severely handicapped.Wilhelmshaven (14th/ 15th September). ...7. The last raid on Wilhelmshaven, on the 14th/15th September, is now reported by a reliable source to have caused heavy damage in the shipbuildingyards and in the city.  Photographic confirmation is not yet available.  . ... .Dilsseldorf.8. The following extracts from a private letter received by the Minister ofa neutral country in London indicate the effect of our raids on Dusseldorf : &quot; . . . . We spend every night in the cellar. On the 10th september the bombing was like nothing we had heard before. The first attack wasbad, but the second far worse. It was so bad that I could scarcely bear it.It is a wonder that I am alive. I shall never forget that terrible night.The gunfire and everything was fearful.....The raid lasted from 11 o&apos;clock till 1. The explosions of the land-mines were horrible, and time bombs kept going off....., The fire fighters had to work all day long. &quot; The city is ruined. Thestation had only one entrance and one exit working. The line to Colognewas open, but all the others were damaged. A quarter of the station is completely wrecked.The big hotels and restaurants are all gone. So are the amusementplaces.....The big houses are in ruins and in the old. town there are three housesleft.....A lot of streets are destroyed.   To give you a clear picture ofthe damage I should have to name every street in Dusseldorf. .....All the trams have been very late because of the special trains takingaway the homeless. No less than 190,000 are without houses. The death rollis not yet known, but for material damage Dusseldorf now heads the list.Some aircraft were shot down in the town and added to the damage.Dusseldorf is unrecognisable.&quot;De-housing in Germany.9. The Swedish press, in commenting on Dr. Ley&apos;s appointment as Commis-sioner for Housing, says that he will also be responsible for other measures whichintensified raids by British and United States aircraft may require. His taskwill include.&quot; taking care of bombed-out families and ensuring that they have aroof over their heads as soon as possible and with the minimum of friction.&quot; Thisaccording to German comment, is to &quot; prevent sickness and depression fromspreading among the population during the winter.&quot;Ley will be responsible not only for building new houses, but for taking overold houses and other property for these purposes, and a Berlin correspondentstates that he has for some time concerned himself with all the consequences oftotal war. The importance attached to this work is indicated by the fact that Leyas Chief Organisation Manager of the Nazi Party has the entire Party apparatusat his disposal, since the Party is specially committed to -relieving the distresscreated by bombing. .Mining Results.10.   The following have been confirmed :  (i) On the 26th October the 1,500-ton Swedish Valencia was mined and sunk at the Northern entrance to the Sound.[246.88] &apos; b 2

These vessels were attacked by three Mosquitos on 7th November.  Hits were made on one of them.A. H. M. S.. November 30, 1942.
