Printed for the War Cabinet, November, 1942SECRETCopy No.W.P. (42) 54926th November, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY,It is requested that special care may be taken to ^ensure the secrecy of this document.       ^WAR CABINETTHE ROLE OF THE PALESTINE REGIMENTJOINT MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARAND THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES1. The circumstances leading up to the announcement in the House ofCommons on 6th August, 1942, of the formation of the Palestine Regiment aregiven in W.P. (42) 332. The War Cabinet agreed to the announcement in theform recommended by Lord Cranborne which described the role of the Regi-ment in the following terms: &quot;Normally the Regiment will be employed inPalestine or adjacent countries for the defence of Palestine &quot;.The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, had previously recommended thatthe passage in the announcement dealing with the role of the Regiment should read &quot; the role of these battalions will be the same as that of the existing companies of the Buffs., viz., defence of vulnerable points and provision of localmobile forces. The Regiment will be organized and provided with equipmentsuitable for this employment&quot;. He considered that any less specific announce-ment would lead to trouble later with Zionists of almost every shade, and his views were shared by the War Office.2. It was hoped mat the announcement of the formation of the PalestineRegiment would be sufficient to allay for the time being the agitation of Jewishcircles here, in Palestine and in America for facilities for Palestinian Jews toplay a more active part in the defence of Palestine. There is no question butthat this agitation is used as &quot; cover &quot; by the Jewish Agency and their associatesfor the cherished project of a Jewish Fighting Force within the British Armyand by Revisionists and other extremists operating mainly through the American&quot;Committee for a Jewish Army&quot; for the wider project of the creation of aseparate Jewish Army. The undesirability of conceding the demand for a jewish Fighting Force was emphasized in paragraphs 6 and 7 of W.P. (42) 332,and the same considerations apply with even greater force in the case of a jewish Army.3. Subsequent developments have proved this hope unfounded. After ashort period of quiescence, Jewish interests and notably the Jewish Agency,first treated the formation of the Regiment as a step only towards the satisfaction of their demand for a Jewish Force and latterly, when the actual role whichhas been allotted to it became known, as hardly even a step in this direction.In the United States, where the notions held by the general public regardingPalestine are in the main derived from Zionist sources, the effect produced bythe announcement has likewise diminished. The suggestion that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment has not given the Jews the opportunity to fight against Hitler hasbeen rigorously propagated by American Zionists and is itself an irritating-source of criticism of the British conduct of the war. Its removal, or at leastits limitation as far as possible, is thus of great importance: and as it rests,as regards Palestine, upon a sincere confusion between two distinct questions,viz., (a) the defence of Palestine by the Jews already in that country; (b) thecreation of a Jewish Army and ultimately of a Jewish State in Palestine, any action by His Majesty&apos;s Government which will tend to clarify American opinion on the first and immediate issue will be of benefit as, regards the second,and as regards Anglo-American relations generally.
4. The statement in the House of Commons said &quot;it is hoped to obtain atleast 10,000 additional recruits for it&quot; (the Regiment). Recruiting for the regiment has, however, not shown the increase anticipated by the Jewishinterests themselves. In spite of the fact that until 3rd September it was believed, and indeed advertised by the Jewish Agency, that the Palestine Regi-ment would have a wider and more active role than that which has been allotted to it, the figure of 500 recruits per week has never been approached. In factrecruiting for the Palestine Regiment has shown a steady drop from the timeof the first announcement as is shown by the following table:  J oRecruitment for Palestine Regiment Palestine BuffsWeek ending	Jews	Arabs4/7/42         ............ n/7/42         ......... 18/7/42         ......      ...... 25/7/42         ............ 1/8/42         ......      ...... 8/8/42         ...      ......... 15/8/42         ......      ...       ... 22/8/42      ............. 29/8/42         ............ 5/9/42         .........     .. ... .12/9/42         ...      ...       ...... 19/9/42         ............ 26/9/42 3/10/42         ............ 10/10/42         ......      ......

5. The proposed organization of the Palestine Regiment, which will becompleted by the anticipated enlistment of a further eight companies, is fivebattalions (four Jewish and one Arab) and two independent Arab Companies.The equipment allocated to the Palestine Regiment is shown in the following statement. No change has been made or is anticipated in the nature of this equipment.Equipment Position Palestine RegimentStrength at 30th September 3,962 all ranks	Rifles	Pistols, revolver	L.M.G.	T.S.M.G.

Coys, and Jewish Settlement Police include 3,000 captured. These willrequire subsequent replacement.6. On 3rd September, at a meeting in Palestine, the representatives of theJewish Agency were informed by G.O.C., Palestine, that the role of the Regimentwould be the same as that of the existing Palestine companies of the Buffs,viz., the defence of vital points and the provision of local mobile forces, andthat the regiment would be organized and equipped suitably for this role.The Jewish Agency now profess to be unable to reconcile this with theannouncement in the House of Commons. Furthermore, the apathy towardsthe Palestine Regiment, which has always been apparent in Palestine, hasincreased in Jewish circles elsewhere since the functions of the Regiment became known, with the implication that the British Government are trying to denythe Jews the right to defend their homes in Palestine.7. In order to obtain the necessary material to convince Jewish opinionall over the free world that we are giving Palestinian Jews real opportunity tofight in the defence of Palestine, the Secretary of State for War, after consulta-tion with Lord Cranborne, asked the Minister of State for his views on1st October (Annex I). The Minister of State&apos;s reply dated 9th October is at annex II.  From this it is clear:  (a) That the problem of the employment of the Palestine Regiment, so longas they form a part of the forces deployed in the Middle East, mustbe regarded as a part of the whole Middle East military picture.(b) That in this picture the only possible place they have at the moment is in the defence of vital points in Palestine.(c) That in this role they are doing most valuable work in that they releasemore highly trained and seasoned troops urgently required elsewherewho would otherwise have to undertake these duties.(d) That they are equipped and organized in a manner suitable to the role which they have been allotted, and that to equip them on ahigher scale would be wasteful.(e) That in this essential role they are most certainly taken seriously as a fighting force.(/) That as opportunity presents for their release from this role, and asequipment permits, they will be given training as units for a higherrole.
8. We consider that the reasons given in the Minister of State&apos;s telegram forthe role allotted to the Regiment are unassailable on realistic grounds. It isappreciated that the interests agitating for the employment of the PalestineRegiment in a more active role (such employment carrying with it, as it neces-sarily does, a higher scale of equipment and a more complete organization forwar), are doing so with motives which are not connected with the immediateprosecution of the war. It is therefore realized that no announcement about the regiment short of agreeing to its transformation into the nucleus of a purelyJewish force will meet these objections. It is nevertheless felt that if anannouncement is made now stating clearly the role that has been at presentallotted to the Regiment, and the importance of this role in the general middle east military lay-out, any subsequent extremist protests against the role willbe demonstrably inspired by political motives, and the moderate but ill-informed criticism in America would receive at least a set-back.9. We therefore propose that the following announcement should be madeby the Secretary of State for War in the House of Commons at a suitable opportunity:  &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government are aware of the anxiety of Jewish com-munities throughout the world to be assured that their kinsmen in Palestineare afforded every possible opportunity to take arms actively against theiravowed enemies, the Axis powers, and to defend their homes in Palestineagainst the agressions of these powers.As has previously been made clear in this House, Jews and Arabs inPalestine have ample opportunity of joining the British Army for serviceoutside Palestine. It was with the object of affording both races theopportunity of serving specifically in the defence of their Palestinian homes,that I announced on the 6th August His Majesty&apos;s Governments decisionto proceed with the formation of the Palestine Regiment of the british army,, for employment in Palestine or adjacent countries for the defenceof Palestine.The defence of Palestine is an integral part of Middle East strategy and cannot be considered apart from it. The duties allotted to the Regimentmust, therefore, be related to the Middle East military dispositions as awhole; its task must be that which at any given moment will contributemost to the defeat of the Axis Powers in that theatre. The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, alone can properly judge what this task should be.The immediate role,which he has allotted to the Regiment is the defence against sabotage and;raids on vulnerable points, aerodromes, radio tele-graphy stations, etc., in Palestine, vital to our war effort.This task is one of great responsibility. By undertaking it, the Regimentreleases fully trained and seasoned troops urgently needed for battle, whowould otherwise be required to undertake these duties, while the scale of duties involved is increasing with the arrival of further trained reinforce-ments and the consequent enlargement of base installations. The Regimentis therefore fulfilling an indispensable task and the Commander-in-chief has complete confidence in its ability to carry it out. The scale of armsand equipment required for this role is not so great as that of the unitsfighting actively in -the front line, and it would, therefore, be manifestlyuneconomical to equip the Regiment on a heavier scale so long as&apos; theyhave this role. In matters of this sort, involving the best disposition oftroops, the Commander-in-Chief s judgment and decision receive, as theymust, the full support of His Majesty&apos;s Government.I would stress that this is the immediate role of the Regiment. Presentmilitary circumstances dictate that it cannot be other. But it does not follow that, as the situation develops, the role will not be different. TheCommander-in-Chief intends to relieve units of the Palestine Regiment oftheir general duties, when equipment and circumstances permit, fortraining in field duties. His Majesty&apos;s Government fully approve this intention, and it is hoped that the Palestine Regiment will in its turn been abled by those measures to take a more active part in operations in theMiddle East, should the situation require it&quot;.10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is in agreement with this paper.   . - ...&apos;P.J.G.O. F. G. S.
ANNEX I.copy secret CIPHER TELEGRAMFrom:  The War Office.To : -C-in-C, Middle East.Immediate.69383 cipher (M.O. 5) dated 1 Oct.Following private for Minister of State from Secretary of State for War.We are getting into difficulties with Jewish Agency over role of PalestineRegiment. As you know, Cabinet decided against C.-in-C&apos;s. recommendations in his Ai/30323 of 31st July and C.-in-C. was informed accordingly in WarOffice 56065 of 5th August. Cabinet were mainly concerned with form of announcement but Cranborne interprets Cabinet decision as supporting his own view that question whether battalions should be capable of fighting in infantry brigades need not be prejudged now. C.-in-C. on other hand has assumed thatRegiment&apos;s role was not in question and only point at issue was ^announcement.G.O.C. Palestine has already informed Jewish Agency of our intentions seeMiddle East telegram Ai/50578&quot;of 19th September.While I appreciate that military value of battalions is at present unknownand that from purely military point of view it would be wasteful to equipthem as normal first line battalions at this stage, it would help me a lot if I could say that possibility of more active role was not ruled out. To make this con-vincing it would be necessary for military authorities to show that they wereprepared to take these battalions seriously as a fighting force if they did wellin their limited role. Can you suggest anything that would help in this direction,for example facilities for more advanced training? You are aware of political considerations. Object of Palestine Regiment was to sidetrack agitation forJewish Army and, unless we convince Jewish opinion here, in Palestine andin United States, that we are giving Palestinian Jews real opportunity to fight in defence of Palestine, we shall be no better off than before. Should be verygrateful for your advice.T.O.O. 1815/1.
ANNEX II.copy secret CIPHER TELEGRAMFrom : -C-in-C, Middle East.To :  War Office.286090.Desp. 1815 9 Oct. 42.Reed. 0600 10 Oct. 42.Rptd. G.O.C. Palestine and Transjordan.(For High Commissioner, Palestine).Immediate.58422 cipher 9 Oct.First Cipher Part.Private and Secret for Secretary of State for War from Minister of State.I have discussed with Commanders-in-Chief your telegram No. 69383(M.O. 5) of October 1st and have consulted High Commissioner Palestine.Two^We are agreed that present role of Palestine Regiment must, on military grounds, be firmly maintained. Nevertheless if case is argued from military angle as problem of right use of military force we think political difficulties, which we recognize to be most troublesome, can be met. argument that we must clearly use Palestine Regiment, like any other body of troops, in whatever way they will best contribute to war effort is unassailable.Three. Military grounds for decision to employ Palestine Regiment intheir present role are :   -(a) Defence of Palestine inside Palestine consists almost entirely of protec-tion of vulnerable points (aerodromes, W.T. Stations, BaseInstallations, etc.) against sea or air-borne landings and sabotage.Remaining defence consists of action field army originally operatingoutside Palestine.(b) For defence of vulnerable points static troops with alternative role of.local mobile forces is economical. These are the ways in whichPalestine Regiment is being used. Use of troops with higher scale of equipment would be wasteful.(c) By undertaking this role Palestine Regiment is doing best service to war effort because without it other troops urgently wanted for operations in Eighth Army or Syrian Frontier would have to be diverted tothis task.(d) Number of troops required for this role is such that all existing unitsof Palestine Regiment are required and the task is increasing witharrival of American Air Force Units and on account of increasedbase installations.(e) Units of Palestine Regiment could not, therefore, be spared at present for higher training and even if their numbers were to permit this,they could only be equipped in due order of priority as it would beuneconomical to equip them in preference to other troops alreadymore highly trained.(/) Moreover any decision to equip and train Units of Palestine Regimentto higher scale would result in such Units when trained servingoutside Palestine unless that country became scene of operations.Jewish Agency always expressed desire that Palestinian Jewish units should wherever possible serve in Palestine.
Second and Last Cipher Part.(g) Further any increase in strength Palestine Regiment would be at expensecivil labour in country shortage of which is causing grave concern.(h) There is one further point which may be of assistance to you in any discussion of this subject. Of about 12,600 Jewish Palestiniansserving in army only about 3,000 are serving in Palestine Regimentunits. The remainder preferring to serve in Technical Corps probablyinfluenced mamiy dy higher pay obtainable therein. This service in technical units is of the highest value to the war effort of the Allies.The announcement in the House of Commons on August Sixthenvisaged enlistment of at least another 10,000 recruits for PalestineRegiment. Actually proportion of recruits desiring to serve inInfantry has dropped since the announcement.(i) Above arguments show that from military point of view PalestineRegiment must continue in its present role. This role is an essentialone and it must be emphasized that the regiment is taken seriouslyas a fighting force in their role. Nevertheless it is of course desiredto do all that is possible to improve their training and to the extentto which their numbers enable them to be released for Battaliontraining they will be considered in due priority with other troops forthe issue of further equipment.Fourth. I realise that notwithstanding the strength of the military con-siderations the Jewish Agency may try to argue that the decision to employthe Palestine Regiment in their present role conflicts with the statement in theHouse of Commons that the Regiment would be used for general Service in theMiddle East. There is in fact no contradiction. The Regiment has been raised for general service. It will be trained equipped and used in whatever way willbest contribute to the defeat of the enemy. But the defence of the Middle Eastin general and of Palestine in particular must be considered as a whole. Thebest means of defence must be determined in the light of the total fighting forces available (Naval Military and Air) and the tasks assigned to individualunits must be so assigned as to use equipment and carry out training to thebest advantage. For the time being the right use of the Palestine Regiment isin their present role. This was indicated in the House of Commons statement which included a sentence quote normally the Regiment will be employed inPalestine or in adjacent countries for the defence of Palestine unquote. the regiment are doing good and essential work and the Commander-in-Chief placesa high value on their services.Fifth. If there is any further information you want from here I hope youwill not fail to let me know.T.O.O. 2000.(b42/127)   80   11/42   w.o.p.   12277
