THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1942/28MOST SECRET.Copy No.19W.P. (42) 525.November 13, 1942.. TO- BE KEPT. UNDER LOCK&apos; AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.SUPPLIES TO RUSSIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.(Circulated for Information.)ON the 17th September I was able to present a Report to my colleagues(W.P. (42) 417), showing how well we had fulfilled our promises under the MoscowProtocol. That Report covered the period which ended on the 30th June of thisyear, during which we had succeeded in maintaining deliveries with reasonablepunctuality.2. In the past two months, however, I.have had occasion to bring before theWar Cabinet more than one sign of a deterioration in the state of Anglo-soviet relations. Our present failure to maintain the flow of supplies has contributed to the difficulty of keeping on good terms with Russia.3. This failure has arisen from decisions in the strategic sphere which havehad an inevitable repercussion on the flow of supplies to the U.S.S.R. As this paper will show, the decision to discontinue convoys to North&quot; Russia until january 1943 will result in our having to hold up the despatch to Russia of thebulk of our commitments, as well as United States commitments, under the SecondProtocol which would normally have gone by this route for the months of july to December, i.e., the first six months of the period covered by this agreement. I need not emphasise how serious a loss this represents to the Soviet Union at thepresent time and how difficult it may prove for us to catch up on these arrearswhen convoys are resumed.4. I feel, therefore, that my colleagues ought to be aware of the details ofthe situation in regard to supplies, which I have described above. As thedifficulties result from transportation rather than supply limitations, my reviewof the situation will be mainly concerned with shipping and transport problems.5. The Triparite Agreement concluded at Washington on the 6th October,1942 (W.P. (42) 438) gave binding force to an offer which had been made to theSoviet Government on behalf of the United States and United Kingdom Govern-ments on the 29th May. This offer said (in effect) that within the limits imposedfrom time to time by the shortage of ships, by the necessity for providing navalescorts for convoys by the Northern route, and by the undeveloped inland trans-portation in the Persian Gulf area, the United States and ourselves -would supply the shipping necessary to lift that part of the export programme, comprising3,300,000 short tons to the Northern ports and 1,100,000 short tons to the persian gulf ports during the year ending the 30th June, 1943. This programme includes,of course, not only the major military items aircraft, tanks, Bren carriers andM/T vehicles&apos; but the large tonnage of munitions, raw materials, electrical andindustrial plant and. machinery, medical supplies, food-stuffs, oil products, andso forth, which we and the Americans have agreed to make available.[24622]
&quot;Northern Route.6. By the Northern route the last escorted convoy of 40 merchant ships(P.Q. 18) completed delivery of the Moscow Protocol June quota and carried apart of the July quota under the Second Protocol. It reached North Russianports on the. 21st September. No further escorted convoys are at presentscheduled to sail by this route before the end of the year.7. The effect of this state of affairs is that there were 40 merchant ships 11 British, 28 American and 1 Russian ^awaiting convoy at the end ofSeptember. Thirteen of these have sailed independently and three have arrived in North Russia. Of the remainder, five are believed to be sunk, two have beenbrought back and are safe, and three are still on passage. I understand that theAdmiralty and the Minister of War Transport do not, in the light of this result,feel justified in repeating the experiment.8. The 11 British ships carry materials which count against the remainder of Julv, the whole of August, and a small part of the September monthly quotafrom the United Kingdom.9. Most of the September quota, and the whole of the October. november and December commitments are in theory piling up awaiting a shipping oppor-tunity. If the Admiralty&apos;s present intentions of sailing a convoy of not morethan 30 merchant ships about the first week in January are carried through, therewill be room in the convoy for very few new ships to carry the four months&apos; quotasof major military items and between 20,000 and 30,000 tons of &quot; non-military &quot;goods (electrical equipment, machine tools, cordite, &amp;c.) which will have accumu-lated by the end of the year. There may, however, be shipping-space on someof the American ships which require dry docking before they sail, to be found by discharging low priority cargoes and restowing with aircraft, lorries and tanks.10. Apart from this accumulation, no less than 25 American ships, whichhave failed to find places in the P.Q. convoys, have had to be discharged in thiseountry by arrangements agreed between the American and Soviet authorities.Although some of the priority items on these ships have been restowed andshipped to Russia, the prospect of on-carrying the rest of the cargo is so remotethat most of it will have been taken into consumption by the United States ArmyAuthorities or handed over to British Government Departments.11. This being the position on the Northern route, it is not surprising thatthe Soviet Ambassador has been pressing me to find some other means of-despatching material of the highest priority, to his country. The Air ministry are examining the question whether, by fitting long-range tanks, they can manageto fly some of the 520 Hurricanes which are due to be despatched from theUnited Kingdom before the end of the year direct to a North Russian aerodrome1,060 mi les from the Shetlands. Unfortunately, it has not yet been possible tofind shipping space for any of these aircraft on vessels bound for the persian gulf via the Cape, although 150 Spitfires which the Prime Minister offered toM. Stalin in October are due to be despatched by that route by the end ofNovember.Persian Gulf Route.12. The Allied Supplies Executive on the 9th December, 1941, fixed a target figure for Russian supplies to be cleared inland through Persia at 100,000 tonsa month. They did not expect this to be achieved before the summer of 1942.At the time when the Second Protocol offer was made, the Minister of Productionestimated the import capacity of this route at about 1 million tons over the year,i.e., at an average rate of approximately 80,000 tons a month.13. Until September of this year, when the inland clearance figure reached a total of 30.700 tons, the amount cleared through Persia has been below this figure. The War Office have no figures for October, but there were some40,000 tons awaiting clearance before the end of September, and some 65,000 tons are due to arrive at the ports from the United States during November, in-addition to about 3,000 tons of raw materials from the Indian Ocean area. Itdoes not seem likely that the capacity of the routes will be raised to 100,000 tonsuntil February 1943, at the earliest, after the American Army has taken over their operation.14. Thus, although we have agreed to the loading in North America during november of 110,000 tons of Russian aid, United States transportation material.
and Persian civil supplies, it is by no means certain that the Russian cargoes,when they do arrive in mid-January, will get through to the extent that we nowexpect. r.Zahidan-Meshed Route.15. Owing to breaches on the Indian railways caused by flooding, this lorryroute is wholly at a standstill until early December. When it is resumed, therewill be some capacity for Russian raw material supplies, but it cannot be large.We can foresee 2,000 tons a month, but the utmost capacity we can ultimatelvhope for, if all our requirements in material and personnel are met, is 15,000 tonsa month in all, of which China must have a share.Trans-Pacific Route.16. The use of Siberian ports is restricted at present to Soviet ships carrying&quot; non-military &quot; goods. So far as we know (and our information is meagre), theJapanese have not interfered with the supply ships, 39 of which (including twotankers) were to have loaded during October on the American Pacific Coast.The programme for these ships which we received at the end of Septemberincluded nearly 160,000 tons of goods, the United Kingdom share of which wasrestricted to 4,400 tons of aluminium.17. Shipments of lead and wool from Australasia by this route are beinglifted as Russian ships become-available; about 7,000 tons of these commoditieshave sailed since July and a further 6,000 tons are booked for loading.18. The air route via Alaska is being developed by the United states authorities for the flight delivery of American aircraft to Siberia using Russianpilots. I understand that, by agreement between the Soviet Purchasing Commis-sion and the American Army Air Force, the following fighter aircraft against british commitments are due to be despatched by this route  Replacement of 179 Airacobras delivered in September to the UnitedStates A.A.F. in the United Kingdom for urgent operational use.Allocation   of   429 P.39s. from American production in accordancewith the Arnold-Towers-Portal Agreement.608.19. This air route is in an experimental stage at present, and the problem- of despatching spares for the aircraft flown along it has not yet been satisfactorilysolved. But there can be little doubt that; eventually, it should develop intothe main conduit pipe for the delivery of aircraft from America to the U.S.S.R.Particulars of its operation at present are hard to come by since, very naturally,,the Soviet Government are anxious to avoid any possible interference with it bythe Japanese, and all our information comes from American sources on the express understanding that we do not tell the Russians how much we know-about it.A. E.Foreign Office,November 13, 1942.
