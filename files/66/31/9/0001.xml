I was then able to say that Mr. Justice Tuckerhad, with the Lord Chancellor&apos;s concurrence, undertaken to examine our existing practice.2. I have now received Mr. Justice Tucker&apos;s report and a copy is attachedto this paper.3.   Briefly, the report recommends as follows : (a) Marking of ports of destination.Change is neither desirable nor practicable.(b) Malta.Carrying out of existing instructions requires tightening up.&apos;&apos; In clear &apos;&apos; markings of &apos;&apos; Malta via Alexandria &quot;or &quot; Malta viaM.E.&quot; should cease.(c) North Russia.No change.(d) Marking of ships&apos; names on goods.Change is desirable and should in Mr. Justice Tucker&apos;s view be practicable, subject to further enquiry at the principal ports, and thesubstitution of loading berth for ship&apos;s name on goods and the additionof loading berth on Consignment Notes.4. I am taking immediate steps to ascertain whether there will be any difficulty in discontinuing the marking of ships&apos; names on goods exported. I amalso looking into certain subsidiary matters mentioned in his report.L.Ministry of War Transport,November 16, 1942.[24631]b
The Minister of War Transport.REPORT ON MARKING OF GOODS FOR SHIPMENT.MY terms of reference were &quot; to examine the system of marking goodsdestined for shipment, and to report whether, in the interests of safety of ships,any changes, and, if so, what, are desirable and practicable, having regard to thenecessity of avoiding confusion and delay.&quot;In the course of my formal enquiry I have heard representatives from theAdmiralty, the War Office, Air Ministry, Ministry of War Transport, Board ofTrade, Ministry of Supply, Customs and Excise, Security Executive, CrownAgents for the Colonies, Railway Executive, Chamber of Shipping, NationalUnion of Seamen, National Council of Port Labour Employers, Officers&apos; (merchant navy) Federation and Mercantile Marine Service Association, and two firms of liverpool shipping agents. I have also seen Lord Cork, Lord Chatfield, a naval officer witJh unrivalled experience of Malta convoys, a Merchant Navy Cadet, andsome members of the general public. In addition, I have examined a large volumeof correspondence from the public, a memorandum from Sir Percy Bates, and therelative departmental minutes and documents.The essential matters which have emerged and on which I have concentratedare the marking on goods of (a) the consignee&apos;s name or description and address;(b) the port of destination;(c) the name of the ship.(a) and (b) are, of course, inter-connected, but assuming the port ofdestination is marked &quot; in clear,&quot; the question whether the marking of theconsignee^ address in too much detail may give information to the enemy is nota matter&apos;affecting the safety of the ship, but is one involving considerations ofgeneral security beyond the scope of my investigation. This report, therefore,deals with (b) and (c).(b) Port of destination.The existing practice is, except in the cases of ships proceeding in certain special operational convoys, and requisitioned ships carrying troops and their equipment to secret destinations, to mark all goods with port of destination &quot; in clear.&quot;Exceptions.In the case of certain operational convoys, e.g., Madagascar or any other newtheatre of war, the goods are marked with destination in code, the primary object being not so much to protect the ships from the ordinary submarine and air risks,as to conceal projected military operations. A Malta convoy is an instance ofthese special convoys and is dealt with separately below.In these cases, as well as in the cases of ships carrying troops and their stores and equipment, it is possible for the Government department concerned to collect the goods in depots before despatch, or in other ways to keep the goods at all stages effectively under their control. Furthermore, they involve the shipment of single consignments of a specific quantity of goods generally designed for oneport of discharge.Malta.This is really a case apart from others, because it is regarded as a military operation undertaken at irregular intervals to a known theatre of war, the successof which is enhanced if the enemy is kept in ignorance until the last possible moment. Coding is used to assist in this object, rather than to protect the ships from the ordinary risks. I am satisfied from the evidence I have heard that insome isolated instances the instructions for coding have either not been observedor have been insufficiently carried out. This occurred in 1941, and it was thoughtthat by centralising all stores for civilian use at a depot at Didcot such mistakescould be avoided in future. They have, however, occurred again on the occasionI of the August 1942 convoy. I have no evidence that such errors in fact contributed to tlhe loss of any ship or impaired the success of the operation, but it is obviouslya serious matter that such instances should occur.   It has not been possible to
identify any of thccases with any particular source of supply; hence it is difficultto suggest a remedy. It appears, however, probable that insufficient obliterationof previous plain markings for Malta, put on the goods for storage identificationpurposes, has been the cause of the trouble. I am told, however, that suchmarkings, even for storage purposes, should not occur. I can only suggest that steps should be taken to see that every depot which could possibly be concernedbe instructed that no goods are ever to be marked &quot; Malta &quot; &quot; in clear &quot; for storage or other purposes, and that if some number or code marking is necessaryfor storage purposes, the marking must be of such a nature that it can be completely obliterated when orders are received for despatch with the appropriatecode sign for Malta. The necessity for the observation of such instructions shouldbe repeated when the order for despatch is given. I am aware that the abovedoes not apply in many instances; e.g., I understand that Air Force MaintenanceUnits never keep goods specially allocated for Malta they are merely instructedat the last moment to mark and despatch goods as required, and they never know from first to last that the goods are destined for Malta. What I have recom-mended only applies to those oases where for any reason it is found necessaryto accumulate and allocate certain goods specifically to Malta. I am concerned,of course, only with the system and not with the human element of error in its execution.A small quantity of goods is still occasionally despatched for Malta viaAlexandria, and is marked accordingly &quot; in clear.&quot; This is,. in my opinion,unnecessary and undesirable. Such goods could be marked with the appropriatemarking for Alexandria, with any other additional secret marking necessaryto identify the goods on arrival as allocated to Malta. I do not consider itnecessary for the purposes of this report to go into the question of procedureat Alexandria. Certain fast ships are kept at Alexandria specially for thepurpose of serving Malta. When they load, it becomes a matter of commonknowledge that a Malta convoy is in preparation (unless, as happened recently,the whole operation is a bogus one to deceive the enemy). Furthermore, supplies for Malta are stored at Alexandria in the warehouses of the Malta shipping committee, so that when goods for loading are taken out everyone knows thepurpose. I mention these matters in passing as perhaps worthy of consideration and further investigation by the authorities concerned, but as being outside the purview of my investigation.General rule.Having dealt with the exceptional cases, I pass to the general practice whichaffects all ordinary commercial cargoes and all Government stores not includedin the exceptional cases referred to above. . The Government stores involved goin fast requisitioned ships attached to convoys carrying troops, as well as inthe slower moving freight convoys and in ships sailing without escort. As stated above, all such goods are marked with port of destination &quot; in clear.&quot; Havingregard to the manner in which the convojr system operates and the conditions nowprevailing as the result of the enemy occupation of the coast from Norway to spain, I cannot see that the mere mention of the port of destination affords any information to the enemy which is likely to affect the safety of any particularship or convoy. It is common knowledge that goods are being shipped from thiscountry to ports all over the world. Special precautions are taken for other reasons with, regard to secret weapons or goods of a particular nature being sent for the first time to a particular locality. Convoys sail for long distances afterleaving the United Kingdom in certain well-known and well-defined directions,regardless of the ultimate destination of the ships included therein. It is secrecyas to the particular route within those wider areas, coupled with the point of assembly and date of departure ,of the convoy, that is vital to the safety of theships. In the case of an unescorted ship there is nothing to indicate when loadingwhether she is sailing singly or in convoy, so that I think the same considerations apply in that case. I- have discovered nothing during my inquiry which leadsme to think that the existing practice of marking ports of destination &quot; in clear &quot;is calculated to endanger the ships concerned.I have, however, considered whether, on the assumption that -the presentsystem might in some unforeseen way assist the enemy, and in view of the undoubted misgivings on the subject in the public mind, a general system of codingof ports of destination would be. practicable. I have heard a great deal ofevidence on this matter from those intimately acquainted with the practical sideof the question. The evidence that, though possible, it would be impracticableon account of the inevitable confusion and delay which would result was[24631] &quot; IS?jff b 2
overwhelming. In this connection the following are some of the relevant considerations : Any system of coding must provide for a different clearly distinguishableand easily identifiable mark for every port to which goods are shipped. Thesemarks must be made known to shippers, suppliers, packers, railway officials, dockofficials, Customs officers and dock labourers a,t ports of loading as well as at ports of discharge. The officials concerned at ports of discharge must know notonly the marking applicable to their own port, but in case of over-carriage, themarkings of other ports. Stevedores often have to work under blackout conditionswhich would render any colour marking system very difficult to identify. Nativelabour is widely used at ports of discharge. Some foreign countries insist on themarking of ports as required by their law. Any system of code markings forports, to be of any value, would have to be changed at frequent intervals, whengreat numbers of people of the classes enumerated above would have to be notified.At the time of such changes some goods with old markings would be at sea andother goods already marked would be lying in warehouses awaiting shipment.Allowing for some tendency perhaps to exaggerate or over-emphasise some ofthese difficulties, I am convinced that the general adoption of code marks for ports of destination would inevitably cause delay and miscarriage of goods, and mightwell, for a time at any rate, produce conditions approaching to chaos, and this at a time when speed in the turn-round of ships is so essential. My conclusion on this matter is that any possible gain in security (which I regard as very doubtful) consequent on the adoption of a general coding of ports would be completely outweighed by the certainty of some resultant confusion and the real risk of something even more serious. I regard such a change, therefore, as neitherdesirable nor practicable.North Russian Convoys.Before leaving this question it is necessary to say something about goodsshipped in convoy to North Russia. Although for some purposes such convoysmay be regarded as akin to Malta or other operational convoys, the practice now is to mark ports of destination, e.g., Archangel or Murmansk, &quot; in clear.&quot; Thereasons for this are partly due to conditions resulting from decisions on mattersof policy, and partly because it is considered impossible, having regard to the equipment, &amp;c, necessary for such expeditions, to keep secret their destination.What I have said above with regard to the security essentials for convoys ingeneral, applies with even greater force to these North Russian convoys by reasonof conditions peculiar to them, i.e., the long delays between leaving ports ofloading and point of convoy assembly, the journey to Iceland, and then the further delay before the convoy finally sets sail on its secretly decided, route. It appears,therefore and this is the Admiralty view that such markings of goods do nottend to endanger the convoys. This being the case, and having regard to thefact that Russian Officers are on board the ships, the goods are required by theRussians to be marked with Russian hieroglyphics, the ships are equipped&apos; in away which necessarily betrays their destination, and it is the policy deliberatelyadopted and openly stated to publicise the sending of such supplies and toencourage the marking of goods with greetings from the workers of this countryto their Russian comrades and other similar slogans, it appears to me that theadoption of code markings for Archangel and Murmansk would have no additionalsecurity value. The above observations apply so long as these convoys are proceeding with some regularity. If they are discontinued and resumed again at some future date, it would be very desirable to take special precautions to conceal the fact and date of resumption.(c) Marking of ships&apos; names on goods.I have found some difficulty in ascertaining with certainty in what cases theauthority concerned requires or permits the marking of ships&apos; names on goodsor on labels attached thereto. The instructions on the matter sent out by theSea Transport and Liner Departments of the Ministry of War Transport withregard to the goods with which each Department is respectively concerned differ(see , Annexes &quot;A&quot; and &quot; B &quot;). These instructions relate respectively toGovernment cargoes carried by commercial ships and ordinary commercial cargoescarried in the same ships, and I understand that Government stores carried inrequisitioned ships are marked in the same way as Government cargoes in commercial ships, namely, with the ship&apos;s name marked either &quot;in clear&quot; ora,
in code in those cases where requisitioned ships sail under code names. It seemsto me highly desirable that there should be uniformity in practice with regard toall cargoes in this respect.I think one should approach this question from the point of view of whetherthe marking of the ship&apos;s name on the goods is really necessary, rather thanwhether it can be proved to have endangered any particular ship. The public ingeneral and seamen in particular are strictly enjoined that the utmost secrecy isnecessary with regard to the use of the names of ships and their movements. i must assume that such secrecy is desirable, notwithstanding what has been stated above with regard to the route and sailing date of convoys being the primary con-sideration. On this basis it is surely incumbent on the authorities to live up tothe standard which is required from the public. The present practice of markingships&apos; names on a considerable portion of goods carried by sea does not complywith this standard and it does not appear to me to be necessary. I have found agreat measure of agreement on this point from those with intimate knowledge ofthe subject. The only substantial objection comes from the Railway Executive.Their view is that it is necessary for the efficient marshalling of railway trucksat the port of discharge to have the trucks or their contents marked with the ship&apos;s Name, either &apos;&apos; in clear &apos;&apos; or in code. The Railway Executive representative statedthat, in the case of consignments of two tons and over, railway practice is toaffix to each truck at the forwarding point a label showing the ship&apos;s name, this information being obtained from the Consignment Note if not shown on the goodsthemselves. He eventually agreed, however, that particulars of the loading berthinstead of the ship&apos;s name should suffice, with the qualification that such a change should not be adopted until there had been conferences at each port to ascertain whether this change would meet with the requirements of the port authorities andthe railways at the principal ports. I have not thought it desirable to delay myreport until such conferences have been held and my recommendation on thismatter is subject.to no unforeseen difficulties emerging therefrom. With this qualification, I therefore recommend that ships&apos; names should in no case be markedon goods or attached labels and that explicit and uniform instructions to this effect should be issued to all concerned by every interested Government Department,but for purposes of railway and dock efficiency the loading berth must be indicated.Nothing in the above will, of course, affect the existing practice of showing theship&apos;s name in Consignment Notes, shipping documents, export licences and the like. It will also be necessary to show the loading berth as well as the ship&apos;s nameon Consignment Notes. Such a change may necessitate some amendment ofexisting statutory requirements, e.g., Regulation 1 (d) of the General Classifica-tion of Goods Regulations dealing with the addressing of goods carried bymerchandise train, and possibly 2 (O) of Article 4 of the Schedule to the carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1924.Generally.In the course of this enquiry I have come across several matters which arenot strictly within my terms of reference, but to which I think I should refer. i feel some concern, which is shared- by many of the witnesses whom I have heard,at the extent to which ships&apos; names, often coupled with approximate sailing dates,are used in such documents as the shipping cards sent to prospective shippers, aswell as in the numerous necessary documents that come into existence in connectionwith the export of goods by sea. I think there is some need for overhauling pre-war practices which are perhaps apt to be taken for granted, or at any rate forimpressing on all concerned the necessity for the greatest care and secrecy in the&apos;handling of these documents. The extent of publication and distribution of theJournal of Commerce, issued daily at Liverpool, might well receive attention, aswell as the question of seamen&apos;s&quot;Advance Notes. Finally, amongst the large volume of correspondence, there are a few instances of alleged incidents whichclearly deserve investigation and consideration by the appropriate Departments,e.g., an alleged case of a large casting clearly marked and exhibited in the streetsof Liverpool for despatch to &quot; H.M.S. Queen Elizabeth, Durban.&quot; I mention this because, although the great majority of letters addressed to the Ministry orLord Cork seemed to me to exhibit a good deal of ignorance, muddled thinking,and failure to envisage the problem except from one angle, a few of them doappear to me to merit further investigation.I have not thought it proper in this report to deal with various changes ordevices which might appease public opinion, but which would have little realsecurity value, e.g., the total abolition of the use of ships&apos; names for all purposes and the substitution therefor of some number with which each ship would be per-manently identified, or the temporary covering over of such words as&quot; Murmansk &quot;
and &quot; Archangel &quot; during transit to the port of shipment. Such matters are, Ithink, of a political nature.My recommendations may be summarised as follows : (1) Marking of ports of destination.Change is neither desirable nor practicable.(2) Malta.Carrying out of existing instructions requires tightening up. &quot; in clear&quot; markings of &quot;Malta via Alexandria&quot; or &quot;Malta via M.E.&quot;should cease.(3) North Russia.No change.(4) Marking of ships&apos; names on goods.Change is desirable and, I think, practicable, subject to further enquiry at the principal ports, and the substitution of loading berth forship&apos;s name on goods and the addition of loading berth on ConsignmentNotes.In conclusion, I desire to put on record that I have received every possible assistance from all the Government Departments concerned and all the witnessesI have seen, and in particular I wish to acknowledge the great help and courtesyof Captain Bennett, who has acted as Secretary in connection with this enquiry.F.
