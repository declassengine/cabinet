THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYEENMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1942. - -MOST SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 563.December 6, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK JgD; KEY.  &apos; , .;It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.VISIT OF THE MINISTER OF PRODUCTION TO AMERICA.Letter from President Roosevelt to the Prime Minister.I circulate, for the information of the War Cabinet and Defence Committee,the annexed letter which I have received from President Roosevelt.W. S. c.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,December 6, 1942.ANNEX.  .Letter from President Roosevelt to the Prime Minister.The White House, Washington,My dear Winston, November 30, 1942.I presume that we shall never satisfy ourselves as to the relative need ofmerchant ships verstis escort vessels. In this case I believe we should try to have our cake and eat it too.[24717] B
At any rate, we are moving aggressively here to increase both of theseprograms and have given them the highest priority for materiel and machine tools.So far as merchant shipping is concerned, we have, after re-examination ofour steel plate problem and other facilities, determined to increase it to18,800,000 deadweight tons in 1943. I intend to raise this to 20 million tons if,after re-examination by our people, it should prove possible.Of one thing I think you can be sure : that we will build in this country aminimum of 18,800,000 tons of merchant shipping of all kinds. Your offices here will keep you informed of the types of ships that are being built, and, naturally,I would welcome your judgment in regard to this, because it is very important that we have a proper balance between tankers, cargo vessels and transports.I agree that this is the time for me to reply to you concerning the very urgent    1requirements of the British shipping program in 1943.I have had the 27 million ton figure of imports to the British Islesexamined rather hurriedly here by our own people and they are satisfied that this figure is substantially correct.Our joint war effort requires that this pipe-line of materiel and food to britain be maintained; that the moving of this tonnage at reasonably even levelsis a matter of primary importance.   I recognize it as such.I am well aware of the concern with which your Government faces the seriousnet losses in tonnage to your merchant fleet. It is a net loss which persists, andI think we must face the fact that it may well continue through all of next year.I therefore want to give you the assurance that from our expanding fleet you maydepend on the tonnage necessary to meet your import program.Accordingly, I am instructing our Shipping Administration to allocatethrough the machinery of the Combined Shipping Adjustment Board enoughdry-cargo tonnage out of the surplus shipbuilding to meet your imports, the supplyand maintenance of your armed forces and other services essential to maintaining the war effort of the British Commonwealth, to the extent that they cannot be transported by the fleet under British control.I have been given to understand by our combined shipping people that anaverage of nearly 300,000 tons each month of carrying capacity will have to beused to supplement the tonnage already engaged on behalf of&quot; the British war effort. Because of the commitments already made, the allocation of ships duringthe next three months must of necessity be less than the average for the whole period.We may hope for a substantial reduction in this if we can make our way through the Mediterranean. Furthermore, I think that you and I should insist that every possible economy is exercised by our shipping and military authorities.You will, I am sure, agree that emergencies may develop which may requireme to divert for our own military purposes tonnage which it is now contemplatedwill be utilized for imports to Great Britain. There will, no doubt, be other cases in which we shall wish jointly to confer relative to vital military uses ofmerchant tonnage.
I want you to know that any important diversions of tonnage will be made only with my personal approval,&apos; because I am fully cognizant of the fact that your Government may feel that decisions might be made to divert tonnage in contravention of the policy which I am laying down in this letter. [SeeEnclosure.]The allocation of tonnage month by month must be worked out by the combined Shipping Adjustment Board. And hence I confine myself to the above statement of policy. I wish to give you the definite assurance, subject to the qualifications I have indicated, that your requirements will be met,.,. - ,We have increased our escort program recently by 70 for 1943, so that weshould turn out 336 escort vessels during the next calendar year. I am asking( ^admiral King to confer with your representatives here and make arrangementsabout the distribution of these ships.The problem of getting our troops to England is a serious one. I recognizethat there must be a minimum joint force there, well equipped and prepared tomeet any eventuality.While &apos;&apos; Roundup &apos;&apos; seems more and more difficult, I do not think it shouldbe taken off the boards by any means. We never can tell when the opportunitymay come for us to strike across the Channel, and if that opportunity comes wemust be ready to take it. Obviously, however, the success of our joint enterprisein North Africa requires us to review the movement of our troops during the nextfew months. . We need to come to an early decision as to what our next steps are going to be, and upon that decision must rest the determination of the numberof American divisions that should be in England. We have this whole matter very much in mind here, and our Chiefs of Staff have it under constantconsideration.As you know, we have recently agreed upon a program of 82,000 combatplanes. There have been misgivings in some quarters about the size of thisprogram. I have none. We simply must get a complete domination of the airnext year, even though other important things give way.One thing is sure : that the aircraft must be brought to bear on the enemy atthe earliest possible moment, and, if there are competent British and Russiancrews to fight these planes and you can get at the enemy quicker and just as effectively as we can, then I have no hesitancy in saying that you and the Russiansshould have the planes you need:We must give consideration to the shipping difficulties that are met when wesend our United States air forces great distances. We have heavy commitments in the Southwest Pacific. We are rapidly assuming similar commitments in north africa, and the bombing of Germany and Italy, whether from England or Russia,must be an unrelenting and constant business.There have been many conferences taking place here between our respectiverepresentatives regarding the distribution of aircraft. I am in accord with theagreement that has been reached: Oliver will tell you of this. A detailedmemorandum of the agreement will follow in a few days. Oliver has impressed upon me the necessity of making an early decision regarding the distribution of[24717] B2
our combined aircraft production.   I think the -decisions that we have come toregarding aircraft are of the highest importance.I am told that there is a substantial meeting of minds between your repre-sentatives and ours relative to the medium tank. I must confess that I think weare both underrating the need for these medium tanks. It is quite possible thatthe Russians may again press for large increases in medium tanks andJE havea feeling that we are cutting our pattern pretty thin. I am asking (jeneralMarshall to explore this once more. I should think it would be no great strain on our production to get a few more thousand medium tanks in 1943.I understand that some of your ground force requirements have not yet beendiscussed with my officers.   These are being considered.   every effort will bemade to include your essential requirements in our Army Supply Programme-)and I have asked to have a report of these further discussions submitted to measures early as possible.I also recognize that your own production for Navy, Army and Air, and forthe minimum needs of the civilian population, requires an assured flow ofmaterials, machine tools, components and complementary items from America.These supplies, unless unforeseen circumstances intervene, will be maintained.In conclusion, I want you to feel that this letter, together with the agreements^that Oliver is taking hope with him, gives you the assurances that you need in planning your own production, and that you may regard them as a firm base uponwhich to make the allocations of your remaining reserves of manpower.As ever yours,FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT.. P.S. I forgot to say: Russia asks 500 transport planes as a primenecessity.   Let us remember that we may have to revise that item.F. D. R.The Right HonourableWinston Churchill,Prime Minister.Enclosure.Memorandum for Admiral Land.I have been going over with Oliver Lyttelton the import needs of the UnitedKingdom for 1943, together with the whole shipping problem of the BritishGovernment.  In all probability, the British are going to lose again in 1943 more... . * To be circulated later.
ships than they can build. If we are going to keep England in the war at anything like this maximum capacity, we must consider the supplementing of their merchantfleet as one of the top military necessities of the war. Naturally, the support ofour forces in the Southwest Pacific and in Africa fall in the same category.I am very anxious that the British programs shall be carried out inaccordance with the principle of the memorandum of the 6th October, which Ihave approved, and that there be no substantial diversions from any of theseenterprises. I wish you would consult me prior to any action taken by you whichwould seriously affect any one of them. Of course, I do not expect to be consulted by you on the many adjustments you are required to make from day to day.(       November 30, 1942.F. D. R.
