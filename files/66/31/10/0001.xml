[^TfiJjpCUMENT, IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.      - &apos;y&apos;-^T42.)530 Copy No, 30 4 3fgSer^7th, 1942 -: - -      .--- *uWAR    CABINET.AGE AT WHICH MEN IN ROYAL MARINE division should BE SENT ON ACTIVE SERVICE.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.,1.      On the 3rd September, 1939, the House of Commons was informed by the Secretary of State for War that men called up under theMilitary Service Acts would not be sent abroad until they reachedthe age of 20.     On the 2nd December, 1941 the Prime Minister asked the House to release.him from this pledge but implied that it would stand formen who had not reached the age of 19.     No undertakinghas ever been given for men who enlisted in the Service voluntarily,,Service under the Admiralty and the Air Ministry has never been included in these pledges, as the Prime Minister informed the House    1on the same occasion.2.     The age of conscription has now been lowered to 18.      in announcing this to the House of Commons the Minister of Labour said&quot;the reduction in the age of calling up does not affect the minimum age, namely 19, at which men called up to the Army are posted for service abroad. &apos;J3.     The Admiralty have given an independent pledge not to send boysunder 17 to sea without the consent of their parents.      In addition,the Board of Admiralty, as a matter of internal administration, have regarded Royal Marines pn shore, who are largely serving under Armyconditions, as coming within the War Office pledge.      This has notbeen published.to the House of Commons.      The pledge however is not regarded as applying to service at sea of Royal Marines.4,     The C.C.O. wishes to employ men of the Royal Marine Divisionon operations before they reach the age of 19,      I propose that theAdmiralty should no longer regard themselves as bound, in respectof Royal Marines, by the War Office pledge, and that they should be free to draft to shore service abroad men between the ages of 17 and19 who express a willingness to go.5. The Admiralty intend to take advantage of this proposed relaxationonly when it is necessary for efficiency.A. V. A.ADMIRALTY,  8.W.I.
