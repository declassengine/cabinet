THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1942..MOST SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) S65.December 7, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.EVENTS IN FRENCH NORTH AFRICA.Memorandum by Secretary of State- for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith an extract from a most secret private letter from Lt.-Colonel K. R. Johnstone, Welsh Guards (head of the P.W.E. unit in Algeria), to Brigadier R. A. D. Brooks, dated the 25th November, 1942.A. E.Foreign Office, December 7, 1942.. ...&quot; At any rate for the first week or ten days we had full control ofthe radio and press, for negative if not for positive purposes. Radio Alger had never had an independent news service before,, but had simply re-transmittedVichy news on the middle waves; it is a weak station, only able to cover Algeriawith the help of relay stations at Oran and Bone. Of the Algiers papers, one,the Echo, was favourable to us; the other two were under a strongly Vichy owner.The senior staff of the radio were also pro-Vidhy. The B.B;C. apparently expectedus to switch suddenly over to the kind of programme which they have been puttingout to occupied France, and expected, moreover, that our doing so would be greetedwith cheers by the population of North- Africa. The reality is otherwise. a violent change would have defeated its own end by being too obviously propagandafrom the other side and opinions were profoundly divided on the subject of Vichy.It has been generally agreed, and even President Roosevelt admitted it, that itwas necessary for military reasons to play with Darlan. Giraud simply did not carry the weight, even with the Army, to rally a united North Africa, and wehad no one else up our sleeve except De Gaulle, and to produce him would undoubtedly have led to civil war. Meanwhile, the Axis were in Tunisia, and wehad to face the fact, palatable or not, that, at any rate so far as the Army was concerned, the Marshall was the name which meant the most. Two yearsof propaganda had done their work, and there was also the far from negligibleconsideration of the &quot; serment,&quot; which meant a good deal to officers distressedby a confusion of duties. After all, for those who wanted to fight the Boche,Darlan offered the chance of a fight under a first-rate military leader, and it is,I suppose, possible that if Giraud does brilliantly in Tunisia his star may intime eclipse Darlan&apos;s. Everyone will be gratified if it does, because nobody trustsDarlan; but Darlan is invested with that extraordinary sanctity of the &quot; pouvoirlegitime,&quot; and his claims to be the mouthpiece of the Marshal do reassure manyin a crumbling world where France is in German and Italian hands, the Marshalis a virtual, and Weygand an actual, prisoner, and Laval is openly pro-Boche.Darlan has at any rate certain claims to lawful authority in the midst of this11917   [24719]
anarchy, his interests now tie him to the Allies, and the. accession of West Africawill strengthen his hand still further, and should incidentally, - strengthen hisposition vis-a-vis of us, since he now brings with him territory which we do notmilitarily control.   The fact of the matter is that, although Darlan could not- bring us the fleet, he could, paradoxically, bring us the Army and cause theimmediate cessation of hostilities; he could even proclaim- the crusade againstthe Axis and bring in West Africa. It is doubtful whether, if he had not chancedto be in North Africa at the time of our landing, anyone else in the country atthat time could have had the authority to do all this in a space of a fortnight.I do not believe that Giraud could have done so.As against this, we have, of course, to reckon that the present regime, eventhough it fights the Axis, is rooted in falsehood. Darlan is Vichy, and Vichy isthe rule of those same wealthy and selfish interests which ruined France. Allthat has happened is that, instead of having to stake all their chances on theGerman side and lose if Germany loses, those interests now have an opportunityof staking on an Allied victory as well. No one is more typical of the grasping,selfish &quot; industrial &quot; whom one associates with Vichy than the big Algerian&quot; colon &quot; or business man, the very people who are most resentful of our coming.Their domination cannot last, and my own belief is that as the French war effortgrows, the Darlan regime will either change completely or become the prisoner of its own victories. There may have to be a civil war before it finally goes under,but at least we have prevented that civil war from occurring when it might haveendangered us all. I don&apos;t myself believe that there will be a civil war at .all,because I think that, once the French are back again in the realities of this warinstead of in the state of doped isolation in which they have been for the past two years, popular feeling for the restoration of France on democratic lines willbe so strong that the sick men of Vichy will be unable to stand up to it. But thattime is not yet. The patient has only just got out of bed for the first time and taken his first tottering steps.The Presidents speech came as a bombshell, but I gather that it has more orless been agreed to look it in the face and pass on; perhaps it is as well that itshould be on record. It has been some consolation to our ardent supporters whohave felt sadly let down by this shabby but inevitable compromise, and now fearto be mobilised under senior officers whose boots they removed on the night of thecoup de main. They might adopt as their own the motto under which the LegionFrancaise, S.O.L. and P.F.F., and other of our opponents, are now trying to reorganise &quot; L&apos;affaire n&apos;est pas finie.&quot; They are unhappy, deeply disappointed,but willing to wait; and I think they are right. One must realise how deeply thiscountry was divided or plunged in coma to appreciate how much has been achieved in a fortnight. Please.remember, too, that, while we have been shot at from London as men of Vichy, here we have also been shot at by the Civil Affairssection for switching too suddenly on to our own propaganda line.Be that as it may, since the conclusion of the modus vivendi with Darlanlast week, our control has rather changed its nature. It is now a joint control exercised by agreement between ourselves on the one side and the French authori-ties, including representatives of Darlan and Giraud, on the other. Most of theFrench executive people, e.g., Bret, are wholeheartedly with us, and even thosewho are not are genuinely trying to play. We have in the last resort the right of veto, but the iron fist is encased in a glove of padded velvet. The general line ofour agreement is that the French have priority in all forms of publicity to north africa, to the European and to the native population; they are particularlyjealous about foreign contacts with the latter. We have priority in all propa-ganda directed from Algeria to Europe and the outer world, and I gather that itis the American intention to make Radio Algiers a platform for their Europeanbroadcasting. If we want the French to go along with us and to renew their independence, I am sure that this is the right kind of arrangement to have. Inthe wrong hands, of course, it would be hopeless : one would be double-crossed at every turn. But as I have said, the -men working the agreement are on pur side,and the results so far have been satisfactory. Even the S.O.L. and P.S.F. are beginning to wonder whether there may not be something to be said for us. Theynumber among their members (not necessarily among their leaders) a great manysincere, but doped, patriots, who, particularly since the German occupation of. Vichy France and the arrest of Weygand, are ready to fight for the liberation oftheir country.For the moment we are in a state of suspension, waiting to see how things goin Tunisia. Four things really matter in this country and in this order : first,military success; second, the visible presence of a large force well equipped, not
for the purpose of overawing the population, but to show them that we meanbusiness and can give effect to our meaning; third, the revictualling of north africa and the reopening&quot; of trade with the outside world; and, fourth, there-education of these people by propaganda until they see world affairs in theirtrue proportion. The more deeply they become involved in the war and identifiedwith it, the more striking our successes are, the quicker this process will be : butthere is a long way to go. Axis anti-Semitic propaganda in particular has madea deep impression here, especially among the Arabs. Two Frenchmen wereoverheard in the street the other day exclaiming in genuine surprise as theywatched some American troops: &quot; Tiens! Ce ne sont pas du tout des typesjuifs!&quot;Before I end, I would like to say how well all our officers have played up.British or American, we have worked as one team and without a single inter-national brawl. The remainder of our reserves from Gibraltar are due into-morrow and the reorganisation here will then be complete. I hope to go toConstantine and Bone and to get things organised in Eastern Algeria, after which I shall begin to think of home and 1 W.G.&quot; ....
