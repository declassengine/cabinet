THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT175Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1942.SECRET.W.P. (42) 552.November 25, 1942.CMWAR CABINET.INDIA.PERFORMANCE OF THE CONGRESS MINISTRIES, 1937-39.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a note on the performance of the Congress Ministries in 19.37-39. In 1941 the Viceroy asked the governors of the seven Provinces where Congress had held office to review the work of congress Ministries in order that the experience of those Governors might be recorded before they retired. The note is based on the Governors&apos; replies and(has been compiled by a retired officer of one of the Indian Services at presentserving in my office, who himself has had experience of Provincial autonomyunder the Act of 1935.It should, of course, be borne in mind that both the criticisms and the praiseof Congress Ministries contained in this note are in many respects applicableto non-Congress Ministries, which are not dealt with in this review.India Office,November 25, 1942.Control by the Congress High Command.1. In the Congress administrations the feature which stands out insupreme prominence is the part played by the so-called Congress High Command.The Ministries were bound hand and foot by this body. It dictated all mattersof major policy; it determined the attitude of the Ministers towards the Services;it settled Cabinet and personal disputes, and in many cases acted as an arbiterin making appointments to civil posts. It was also a Court of Correction fromwhich there was no appeal. In virtue of their majorities in the legislatures,the Ministries were able to give a specious appearance of democratic sanction to their policy, for their position was so secure that they could afford not toburke criticism. In fact, they were instruments of an autocratic totalitarianregime which was bound by no allegiance save to itself. While in many casesMinisters chafed at the extra-Provincial control, in no case (save that of dr. Khare, the first Congress Prime Minister of the Central Provinces, whorebelled but was broken by the Congress authorities) had they courage or strength to break away from it. In some Provinces it would seem that towards the endof their tenure some Ministers may have approached breaking-point,&quot; but it wasnot till the war had reached the door-step of India that an ex-Provincial Premier,Mr. Rajagopalachari, burst the chains which bound him to Wardha.2. There would appear to be little doubt that, but for the High Command,the 1935 Act would have amply served its purpose. The 1919 Act (had laid a sound basis for responsible Government. The people and their leaders had become familiar with and had learned to respect the canpns of the BritishL. S. A.
parliamentary system. They realised that the transfer of power from thebureaucracy was substantial and real, and had it not been for the externalcontrol of the Congress, the Provinces would almost certainly have settled downto the easy stride of the wider democracy of the 1935 Act. The CongressMinisters themselves were parliamentary-minded. Most of them were genuinelyanxious to serve the people, and signs were not wanting that, had it not been for the suspension of the Constitution, those who failed in their duty mighthave been called to severe account by the electorates. In Bombay, for example,Sir Roger Lumley suggests that the administration had become so unpopularthat at one time it seemed unlikely that it would survive an appeal to the people;and the disrepute into which the Central Provinces Ministry fell would sooner or later have broken the Party machine. On the other hand, in Madras, theUnited Provinces, Bihar, Orissa and the North-West Frontier Province it isclear that, though the Ministries had incurred much odium with minorities andvested interests, they would have been returned with substantial majorities had they appealed to the electorate in 1939.Congress Ministries and the Minorities.3. The Wardha dictatorship was also responsible for the second mostprominent and by far the most disastrous feature of the Congress regime -communal tension. As Sir Harry Haig said : &apos;&apos; The Muslims, divided among themselves and uncertain of their position at the time of the General Election,rapidly achieved unity when they realised that Congress did not intend to treatthem on equal terms and were endeavouring to force them into their ranks.&quot;For this reason &quot; the organisation of the Muslim League became widespread,vigorous and formidable, and the activities of the Muslims constituted by far the most- serious of the embarrassments and anxieties of the Congress Govern-ment.&quot; Sir Roger Lumley also lays the blame for communal tension at the door of the High Command, for, he says, it was interference by them with thefree development of the Constitution which was at the bottom of the disquietof the minorities. In the Central Provinces by the end of 1939 the rift betweenCongress and the Muslims &quot; had become so wide and the feelings between them so bitter that it was difficult to foresee a restoration of normal feelings evenin the distant future.&quot; By the time the Ministry resigned, Muslim feelings of distrust and dislike had risen to extreme heights, and their relief at theirdisappearance was celebrated throughout the Province as a Day of Deliverance,an example copied in other parts of India.4. Apart from the Central Provinces, there is nothing in the record ofthe Congress Ministries to suggest why they should have incurred unpopularitywith either the Muslims or other minority communities. On the other hand, the governors say that the Ministers were not only not communal-minded but thatthey acted impartially; indeed, in some cases they went out of their way towardsgiving preference to the Muslims, so that in the United Provinces they wereaccused by the Hindus of partiality to Muslims. The Ministers, too, were not personally unpopular with Muslims, nor did the Ministers discourage Muslimcommunal interests as in educational and religious matters. In some cases,where Muslim susceptibilities were offended, as in Madras, by the singing of&quot; Bande Mataram &quot; at the beginning of the Legislative sittings, the Ministry wasquick to make amends. It is obvious, too, that Muslims must have shared thebenefits accruing from the general policy of the Congress towards the tenantryas well as from prohibition and the abatement of usury.5. Why, then, the Muslim animosity? As Sir Maurice Hallett says, it isnot easy to give the reason. There is no ostensible ground for Muslims thinking that their rights were being trampled underfoot. The answer is, as Sir HarryHaig has pointed out, that Muslim antagonism was in the atmosphere. It arosenot so much from evils that were present but from apprehension of dangers to come. It was a neurosis born not only of ,a latent age-long antagonism, butalso fostered by many years of political suspicion and fear of Hindu intentions.From its earliest days Congress had been looked on by the Muslim community as a Hindu organisation. When it was founded political consciousness was much more- widely disseminated among Hindus than among Muslims, and as its boundaries widened Muslim leaders held aloof.- From the infant days ofIndian democracy-the days of the Morley-Minto regime they became suspiciousand nervous. They feared majority rule, for this inevitably would mean Hindurule. They refused to be merged in the Hindu mass. They accordingly made their own organisations.   They demanded separate electorates and their fair
share of Government appointments. Their educational system must be distinctive;their cultural heritage must!be preserved. Their nationalism must not be sub-merged by force of numbers, or by Hindu slogans, songs or flags.6. Although Congress had many Muslim members, some of whom rose tothe highest offices in the Congress Bligh Command, they, none the less, were aware of the attitude of the vast majority of the Muslim population towards theirpolicy and actions, and when the 1935 Constitution came in it would have seemedwise policy to tread warily in the regions where they knew Muslim feelings were most tender. Flushed with success, however, they determined to join issue on aground in which the Muslims had recently won a hard-fought battle separateelectorates. The Muslims had won in London; Congress determined that theyshould lose in India.7. In theory, of course, Congress is right. Separate electorates should haveno place in a pure democracy, nor, indeed, should reservation of seats with or without joint electorates. But there is not, and never has been, even in Greece, anysuch thing as a pure democracy and, in any case, the autocratic Congress was itself a poor model of the democratic proprieties. Practical democracy is governed bycompromise, and the Congress would not compromise. They insisted on jointelectorates in local self-governing bodies and, in spite of the exacerbation ofMuslim feelings, they would not give way.8. In the event, the Congress policy in local self-government was disastrous.It gave the Muslims solid grounds for their fears. &quot; The Hindu Raj is upon us,&quot;they thought; &quot; Congress is trying to force us into the fold. It is making itimpossible for us to be elected to local bodies, save in the case of those whom we regard as Quislings, as we also do those Ministers whom they have suborned to collaborate with them. In the local boards in the Central Provinces, Muslimshave even to be co-opted by Hindus. Where will it all end ? Round us we see the petty Congress officials strutting about in their new armour aggressive, intoler-ant busybodies they may be, but they are able to make Ministries listen to them,and officials tremble at their look. What can we do? We must organize. Wemust show the Hindus that we are Muslims; we will not wear khaddar we mustdon the achchkan and fez. Our children must be educated in our own schools,where they will be taught of the glories of Akbar and Aurangzeb. We must have our own script. We must preserve our religious and civil rights. Above all, wemust prepare ourselves for the struggle to come. We must join the League. Ifthe British Raj is going, we shall never submit to a Hindu Raj. We will notbe slaves in a Brahmanic Herrenvolkstaat. We must have our own country, ourown Government we must have Pakistan.&quot; -9. Although, as Sir Maurice Hallett suggests, there was no substantialreason for much of the trailing of the communal shirt, the intense antipathy thatthe average Muslim felt towards the boisterous nationalism of the congress party members was quickly translated into violent communal disorder in everyProvince with a substantial Muslim population. In the United Provinces &apos;&apos;. every single festival, and even private ceremonies, such as marriage processions, hadto be watched with the greatest care. Communal tension was seen in everyrelation of life and communal bias expected in every official act.&apos;&apos; This was written by a Commissioner, who also reported that, during the winter of 1938-39, therewere almost continual outbreaks of communal disorder in the big cities of theProvince. The Congress Ministry in the United Provinces tried to be impartial;but they committed the fatal error of interfering with the magistracy in thesettling of communal cases. In irritating issues, like the singing, of BandeMataram and using rival flags, they could not or would not take a firm line.Gradually every order they oassed was suspect, so that by the end of 1939 the communal situation had deteriorated so much that only the resignation of theMinistry saved the Province from far more serious trouble.10. The same was true, to a more serious extent, of the Central Provinces.The Shukla &quot;Ministry was definitely communal-minded. Not only did they followout the Congress policy, which aimed at forcing Muslims into the fold, but theywent not far short of Muslim-baiting. They interfered with the magistracy tosuch an extent that the Muslims cried out that their lives were no longer safeunder Congress Government. Muslim officers were victimized, as in the notoriousChandur Biswa case, in which, following the murder of a local Congress official,the Premier entrusted the investigation to a Hindu GI.D. officer over the head ofthe local Superintendent of Police, who was a Muslim.  Attempts were made to

They realised that the transfer of power from thebureaucracy was substantial and real, and had it not been for the externalcontrol of the Congress, the Provinces would almost certainly have settled downto the easy stride of the wider democracy of the 1935 Act.

Not only did they followout the Congress policy, which aimed at forcing Muslims into the fold, but theywent not far short of Muslim-baiting. They interfered with the magistracy tosuch an extent that the Muslims cried out that their lives were no longer safeunder Congress Government. Muslim officers were victimized, as in the notoriousGhandur Biswa case, in which, following the murder of a local Congress official,the Premier entrusted the investigation to a Hindu C.I.D. officer over the head of .the local Superintendent of Police, who was a Muslim.  Attempts were made to
extend communal vindictiveness even to Europeans suspected of bias towardsMuslims. Muslims, too, were incensed by the lack of consideration shown to theireducational requirements. The communal virus of the Central Provinces spreadalso to the rest of India, and was not exorcised by the resignation of the Ministry.&quot; It might have been hoped,&quot; says the Central Provinces Review on the Section 93regime, &quot; that with the departure of a Government generally believed to becommunal-minded, and its substitution by an impartial bureaucratic Government,the tension between the communities might lessen. This might have occurred ifwe had been concerned only with local matters. Unfortunately, the developmentof all-India politics increased the intransigence of the Congress. The muslim league &apos;s insistence on Pakistan exacerbated the now difficult relationship andwidened the rift between the communities into an almost unbridgeable gulf. Thisgrowing gulf drove even the saner and more moderate elements into more andmore extreme positions.&quot;11. In Bihar the Governor reports that, &quot;though the Ministers were notcommunal-minded, they succeeded only in piling up for themselves an increasingvolume of hostility, distrust and bitter resentment.&quot; There were numerous com-munal incidents, due largely to the aggressive attitude of the Hindu population,who assumed that a Congress Raj was a Hindu Raj. The Party machine, theGovernor says, was the cause of this : it proved too strong for the Ministers. &quot; Itwas all very well for them to exhibit impartiality on the top. The local Congress-men in the districts understood nothing but the &apos; spoils &apos; system; in their eyesCongress was now the &apos; top dog.&apos; They were, they felt, entitled to a rewardfor having worn Gandhi caps and kept the Congress flag flying for years. Theyspread themselves in. the sun of office and authority, and, of course, they were forthe most part Hindus. The Muslim villagers found themselves outside the circleof. influence, but they were expected to salute the Congress flag, sing BandeMataram, and pay their taxes with new joy; such a position they would neverwillingly accept.&quot;12. Congress was only slightly less unsuccessful in its policy towards otherminorities, including the Scheduled Castes. In spite of Mr. Gandhi&apos;s partialityto Harijahs, Congress is generally regarded by the Hindu proletariat as a CasteHindu organisation, but the High Command seemed to assume that their electionpromises of a new earth would secure the allegiance of the lower orders. Theirpromises, however, were forgotten, or at least not implemented. While the minorities must have shared in such benefits from the Congress policy as fell toother citizens, Congress failed to realise that they must win over the ScheduledCaste intelligentsia. They had been led to believe that Congress would sharewith them the loaves and fishes of office. Disillusionment followed. In the united provinces, for example, &quot; during the 1937 election Congress had succeeded incapturing nearly all the Scheduled Caste seats, and there was thus littleindependent representation. The Ministry tried to do their best, but they wereup against.the prejudice of centuries, and it is remarkable how, after the depar-.ture of that Ministry, the Scheduled Castes as a whole have come out in oppositionto Congress.&quot; In Bihar the Congress was unpopular with several minorities.The domiciled Bengalis regarded themselves as unfairly treated as compared withthe indigenous population. The aboriginals felt that their special needs were treated by the Ministry &quot; in a very cavalier fashion.&quot; During the Congressregime the campaign for the separation of Chota Nagpur quickly gatheredstrength owing to the unsympathetic attitude of the Ministry, winch did not increase its reputation by deliberately fostering animosity between Christianand non-Christian aboriginals.13. Aboriginals also suffered in the Central Provinces, as the Congress self-government legislation did not recognise them as a minority community entitledto separate representation.14. In the legislatures, while it is true that&apos;the Ministries gave latitude tominorities for the expression of their opinions, the minorities, suffered from a sense of frustration, which is, however, incidental to all democracies wheremajorities are large. The minorities were particularly helpless in respect of matters in the Congress creed, but theirs are not the only voices in the wildernessWhere creeds are concerned.15. It. is not without significance that the Congress High Command waswise enough to interfere only in Provinces where it had real power. In Madras,for example, Sir Arthur Hope reports that the High Command was allowed to
interfere much less than in other Provinces, partly because it was mostly composedof men from the north and west of India, and partly because of the influence ofMr. Rajagopalachari. Sir George Cunningham points out that in the Nortlh-Wesf Frontier Province the Premier, Dr. Khan Sahib, resented interference inProvincial administration, and was-in a stronger position vis-a-vis the congress in that his was the only Muslim Ministry and in a Muslim Province. Even in bombay the High Command must have winked at separate elections for Muslimsand reservation of seats for women and certain backward communities provided in the local government legislation of 1938-39, though doubtless the specialreservations which permitted the Muslim voters to declare that Muslimconstituencies could be abolished, and the refusal of separate representation inPanchayats were concessions to the Congress conscience.16. In view of their definite realisation of the power of the electorate, thechief evidence of which is their policy of tenancy and rural indebtedness legisla-tion, it is somewhat remarkable that the High Command did not exercise itselfmore convincingly on the need for attracting, or, at least, conciliating the minorities who are ordinarily classed as Hindu. The Governors&apos; views, however,point to the conclusion that Congress failed to win them over. In some cases theyseem to have adopted the same attitude of contemptuous arrogance as in the caseof Muslims. On the other hand, they inherited a legacy of special treatmentfrom previous Governments from which they could not abruptly break, and which,indeed, they supported and in cases expanded. Had they remained longer in office they might have succeeded in capturing the minorities, but as it was theyfailed to seize a great opportunity. They could count on the support of the CasteHindus, but they had to court the favour of the vast millions who by grace are regarded as Hindus. Reason and common sense should have dictated a policyof broad toleration and active encouragement.17. The structure of the legislatures under the Government of India Act,1935, by which each Assembly became an amalgam of major communities,minorities and special interests, unfortunately has encouraged a lot of loosethinking about the rights of minorities, from which the Governors&apos; views are notimmune. Several of them have used the term &quot; minorities &quot; in a vague manner,suggesting that their existence arises only. from the fact that they are notmajorities. For example, several Governors speak of the dissatisfaction of the landlords with the Congress. Sir Maurice Hallett speaks of the Muslim town-dwellers feeling aggrieved by the Ministerial policy of favouring the Hindutenantry. Others write of the antagonism of the capitalist classes. But all thishas really nothing to do with minorities. It arises from the extension of the electorate under the 1935 Act. The landlords and the money-lenders were doomedby the Sixth Schedule, not by Congress; nor can the Congress High Commandmake any virtuous claims because of their pro-tenant legislation. All Ministries,Congress or non-Congress, have to be pro-tenant, otherwise they have no hope&apos;of survival. Whether Hindus benefit, as in the United Provinces, or Muslims, asin Bengal, is an accident of population, not a matter of political policy.Legislation passed by Congress Ministries.18. One of the most remarkable features of the legislation undertaken bythe Congress Ministries in the larger Provinces is its volume. In Bombay theMinistry was responsible for passing about 62 measures, of. which nearly halfare rated by the Governor as important. The Ministries in the United provinces and Bihar were responsible for 57 and 46 measures respectively, including5 regulations in Bihar. Madras and the Central Provinces passed 19 and 15important Acts respectively. The smaller Provinces were more modest; Orissapassed only 7 and the North-West Frontier Province only 6 important Acts.Many of the Congress measures had been prepared by the previous governments and were of a non-controversial character. As Sir Roger Lumley says, theMinistry was very ready to use the legislature for putting through business of anon-controversial and often of a useful character. Some Congress Bills were completed by the succeeding Administrations; and a considerable volume oflegislation, fully prepared and in an advanced, state of readiness, was awaitingintroduction when the Ministries resigned. This break in the Congress stridemakes it impossible to give a true assessment of their achievements, as many ofthe pending proposals were essentially items of their long-term policies.19.   There is nothing remarkable in the trend of legislation.  Even under theold Governments the predominant place was taken by the Revenue Departments &apos;
who deal with the tenancy question. With the wide extension of the electoralpower under the 1935 Act, it was essential that all Ministries, whether Congressor non-Congress, should.first concern themselves with legislation of direct benefitto the tenantry. Moreover, it had been generally recognised for many years thatthe whole landlord-tenant and tenant-moneylender position required completeOverhaul. In some cases the reforming process had set in before the Congresstook control. Their credit lies not so much in policy but in the speed with whichthey put it into effect.20. Although in most cases the Governors have not been able to assess thevalue of the Congress tenancy and indebtedness legislation, the broad conclusionthat flows from their reports is. that it achieved, or was likely to achieve, the objects at which it aimed. Thus, in Madras the Madras Agriculturists&apos; ReliefAct, 1938, is said to have materially benefitted agriculturalist debtors,. and theCo-operative Land Mortgage Bank Act to have enabled the ryots to obtain loans for paying off their scaled-down debts. In Bombay, although the value of theAgricultural Debtors Relief Act, 1939, and. the Tenancy Act, 1939, cannot yet be assessed, they are stated to be the most important legacy left by the CongressMinistry. The former, like all such Acts, struck at the roots of agriculturalcredit, and the Ministry had not the time, as they had intended, to follow it upby legislation to extend credit through co-operative credit societies and landmortgage banks. In the United Provinces, the United Provinces Tenancy Act,1939, is stated to be by no means perfect, but it is admitted that the ryots aregrateful for it. The Governor regards it as &quot;a beneficent measure which willbe a blessing to the vast majority of cultivators and will do no incalculable harm to the landlords.&quot; The measures for the remission of rent and reduction of debt are also stated to be a distinct benefit to the agricultural classes.21. The output of tenancy and agrarian legislation of the Bihar legislaturewas considerable, and the Governor&apos;s view is that broadly &quot; the tenancy legisla-tion enacted by the Congress Ministry did secure its primary object of affordingsubstantial relief to the tenants, and freeing them for the time being from someof their most pressing embarrassments.&quot; On the other hand, Bihar landlordswere hard hit, and the Section 93 Government had to take action to alleviate theirlot, as it was obvious that the Congress Ministry had not appreciated theinequitable results that were likely to follow their policy.22. In the Central Provinces far-reaching legislation on both tenancy and rural indebtedness was passed, but the Acts suffered from bad&apos; drafting andobscurity, so that they could not be put into effect while the Congress ministry was in power. In the case of the Relief of Indebtedness Act, nearly one-third ofits three years&apos; life had passed before two amending Acts made any attempt ateffective administration possible. In the North-West Frontier Province the TeriDues Regulation Repealing Act, 1938, is said to have relieved small tenants ofwhat was undoubtedly a genuine grievance, and the Agricultural Debtors ReliefAct, 1939, achieved its object in so far as there has been a considerable reductionin the number of suits brought by money-lenders to recover their debts.23. The tenancy legislation does not appear to have had harsh effectsin any Province except in Bihar, nor does the usury legislation seem to have beeninequitable. The Congress Ministries were naturally unpopular with the landlords, who, however, have realised for many years that many of their traditional rights and privileges have been doomed. Much of the legislation forthe remission of rents, though in theory expropriatory, in practice really had theeffect of remitting arrears in rent which were irrecoverable. In Bihar the landlordsare said to have been hard hit by the tenancy legislation, not only through an absolute loss of income automatically resulting in the loss of rents, but by aprovision that the entire holding of a defaulting tenant cannot be sold in execution of a rent decree. Only part of. a holding can be sold, with the conse-quence that rent decrees cannot be executed at all, as no one will bid for a partholding. This is the consequence referred to above, which has been put rightby the Section 93 administration. Nevertheless, in Bihar the Congress legislation has been followed by a decrease in agrarian disorder, though it cannot be saidhow far this is attributable to the tenancy legislation of the Gongress or thefirmer attitude adopted by the succeeding administration.24. Another class of the social amelioration type of legislation whichemanated from the Congress High Commands policy it might more correctlybe said to be a fad of Gandhi&apos;s is connected with prohibition. In some ProvincesProhibition Acts were passed, and in others it was introduced by notifications
under existing legislation. Realising the need for going slowly in this contro-yersial field, the Ministries introduced prohibition in experimental areas, but onthe whole, the experiments are reported to be so successful as to be worthy offurther trial, in spite of the inevitable consequences of boot-legging, illicitdistillation and hardship on the castes or classes which traditionally wereoccupied in making drinks or drugs. The people as a whole have shown, littleenthusiasm for Gandhi&apos;s blue ribbon gospel, and without Congress it is doubtfulwhether the experiments will be extended to other areas, or, indeed, continued forlong in the places chosen for sacrifice. Thus the Governor of Madras reports that though the Act may be said to be beneficial to the people it has involved a heavysacrifice. In Bombay the Section 93 administration &quot; was sufficiently impressed with the result of prohibition &apos; to continue it, despite the succession of legal difficulties which provided what might well have been regarded as a sufficient justification for abandonment.&quot; As for the United Provinces, Sir MauriceHallett has reported : &quot; To what extent the prohibition policy has improved the moral and material conditions of the districts in which it has been introduced ismore than doubtful. Prohibition was a policy to which Congress were committed,and to which their leader, Mr. Gandhi, attached great importance, but the mereclosure of Government shops does not create temperance in a country where illicitdistillation is very easy and the public generally have done very little toinculcate temperance or total abstinence.&quot; For Bihar, the Governor reports:&apos;&apos; There is no doubt that there has been a marked decrease in drunkenness in those areas where prohibition has been enforced. This is particularly noticeable in theDhanbad coalfields and in the town of Panchi and its environs. It is probablytrue that a substantial portion of the public who previously spent a considerable part of their income on country liquor have been able to put the money so savedto a more profitable use.&quot; The public, however, were not enthusiastic, and theGovernor remarks that it is a somewhat remarkable circumstance that, with theexit of the Congress Ministry, public interest in the prohibition experimentevaporated almost completely.25. In the Central Provinces, the Governors judgment is that on the whole the Prohibition Act, 1938, has succeeded far enough to justify the continuanceand gradual extension of the/ experiment. In Orissa, the Prohibition Act came into effect only after the Ministry had demitted office. The only effect of prohibition noted in the North-West Frontier Province apart from a loss ofrevenue is that there has been an increase in smuggling.26. The outstanding feature of local self-government legislation undertaken by the Congress Ministries was a concerted attempt to bring1 local authorities under Congress control. In the two smaller Provinces and also in Bihar andthe United Provinces, the Ministers were unable to carry out their policy before they demitted office, although the necessary preparatory steps had been taken,e.g., in the United Provinces by the passing of the District Boards andMunicipalities Acts of 1939, for the purpose of postponing elections pending theintroduction of comprehensive legislation of the general Congress pattern.27. The easy method of paying for party support would have been tomaintain the old system of nomination, but it had been so violently attacked priorto the new Constitution that Congress had to adopt other methods which, although they had the appearance of being more democratic, were equally effective. Thus,in Madras the Madras Local Boards (Amendment) Act, 1937, abolished the oldnomination, system for minority communities in District Boards and replacedit by a system of co-option, whereby members of the Boards themselves could electrepresentatives of minorities. As the Congress had majorities on the &quot;Boardsthis meant the co-option of Congress supporters. In the Central Provincesnomination to Municipalities and District and Local Boards was also replaced by co-option, with the result that Caste Hindus obtained control over bothMuslims and other minorities, as under the legislation there could never be alocal Board circle with a majority of Muslim voters. In Bombay, on the otherhand, although nomination was abolished, the Ministry agreed to separateelectorates for Muslims in local Boards and also to reservation of seats forWomen and certain backward communities subject to the proviso that Muslimvoters could abolish the Constituencies if they wished. Power was also given toMuslims to opt for joint electorates. The Village Panchayats Act, 1939, whileprofessing to extend local self-government to smaller units, was really designedto give Congress Village Committees statutory powers and to strengthen the party
machine. No separate seats were provided in these bodies for Muslims nor wereMuslims given separate representation in Bombay Municipality. With regard toPanchayats, Sir Roger Lumley sums up the situation thus : &quot; In so far as the Actforces self-government on people who do not want it, who. cannot exercise iteffectively, and who are unwilling to tax themselves, it must break down inpractice.&quot;28. Two other features of the local self-government legislation call forcomment. One is the policy of Congress to reinstate those who had sufferedunder the past regime, although this involved, as Sir Arthur Hope says, a gravebreach of faith with, those &apos;&apos; who helped Government in difficult times by under-taking the duties of officers in place of disloyal men who threw up their jobsor courted dismissal.&quot; By the Madras Restoration of Village Officers(Validation) Act, 1937, village officers who resigned or who were removed fromoffice on account of participation in political movements were restored to their offices, but, as the Governor says, this is a dangerous weapon which any government can use if it is so minded. Legislation of a similar character waspassed in Bombay The City of Bombay Municipal (Amendment) Act, 1939,the purpose of which was to preserve the seats on the Bombay MunicipalCorporation, of some 18 councillors who were convicted under the Defence ofIndia Rules.29. The other&apos; is the franchise. Here at least one Ministry did a signalservice to their Province. In Madras the local franchises were assimilated tothat of the territorial constituencies of the local Assembly. This is a franchisereform of the first order of importance. Bombay went beyond this by introducingadult franchise in the Municipality of Bombay, a measure which, Sir RogerLumley&apos; says, aroused acute antagonism to the Ministry, especially among theMuslims. The Bombay Ministry was ill-advised to put the Municipal franchiseout of step with that of the Assembly, as there can be no question that one ofthe most urgent reforms called for in the Provinces is the assimilation of allthe franchises, of the theoretical desirability of which there is no dispute.30. For many years prior to the new Constitution one of the favouriteCongress allegations against the previous regime was the ill-treatment ofprisoners in gaols. Many Congressmen had personal experience of gaols, andfrom their vantage point as political prisoners became familiar with gaol rules and routine, and also the treatment accorded to ordinary convicts. They wellknew that prison administration in India is conducted on a high level of efficiency and humanity, and it is not surprising, therefore, that when they came into power, the Congress Ministries forgot many of their past fulminations.Some Ministries, however, did take steps to improve prison conditions and makeadministration of the criminal law more lenient. Thus, in the United Provinces,three Acts were passed, the Borstal Act, 1938, the Prisoners&apos; Release onProbation Act, 1938, and the First Offenders Probation Act, 1938. These Acts,which the Governor calls &quot; reasonable,&quot; were supplemented by executive ordersabolishing some of the more strenuous tasks allotted to prisoners. The BombayGovernment passed only one Act, the Bombay Probation of Offenders Act, 1938,&quot; a well intentioned measure, the practical utility of which will depend on acadre of good and experienced probation officers.&quot; In the Central Provincesthe Ministry enacted more than one measure, one of which, the Prison ReformAct, 1939, could not be brought into force because of difficulty in making rules.Another Act of 1939, called the Political Prisoners Act, was designed to classifyall political prisoners in the &quot;A&quot; or &quot; B &quot; classes. This measure&apos;had to be repealed soon after the Ministry demitted office, as it was found impossible to administer it. The Ministries in the other Provinces enacted no legislation,but in some cases they altered the gaol rules to the advantage of prisoners,e.g., in Orissa, where they modified the whipping rules, with the result thatthere was some slackening in gaol discipline.31. The legislative output in the field of education was small, for the reason that in all Provinces adequate machinery was in existence for the spread ofeducation before the Congress Ministries came in. The main Congress objective was to introduce what has come to be known as the Wardha basic scheme of. education, but like previous Governments, the Ministries soon began to feel theshackles of finance. Nevertheless, in some cases they achieved solid results. Inthe United Provinces, for example, the Governor speaks.of their scheme as havingproved very successful. Some progress with the scheme was made in Orissa,but it had not got under way when the Ministry resigned.
32. It was &quot;in the Central Provinces, however, that the Congress Ministryexercised itself most diligently, and its record is rather dismal. Properlyspeaking, their educational effort should be discussed under the head&quot; Administration,&apos;&apos; for it was in respect of administration rather than legislation that the Ministry failed. Only two.Acts were passed, the Vidya Mandir Act,1939, and a minor measure the Primary Schools Amendment Act, 1939. Theformer measure aimed at establishing village educational societies as corporatebodies with separate funds consisting of endowments, donations and government grants-in-aid. The ideals of the Ministry, however, were not realised. Theendowments consisted of inferior land, donations were not forthcoming, and thefinancial implications of the scheme were not adequately thought out. The schemefor basic education, &quot;presented ready made to the Department,&quot; also failedbecause the Ministry failed to appreciate the financial realities of the situation,but, apart from this, in the words of the Director of Public Instruction, thescheme was &quot; inherently unsound.&quot; Several other schemes failed for similar reasons, for example, a scheme for extending facilities for Harijans&quot; andaboriginals, and a physical welfare scheme. In all these cases the organizers werechosen for their political more than their professional records, with disastrousresults.33. The education schemes of the Central Provinces Ministry were alsonotorious throughout India for communal bias; as the Director of PublicInstruction reports : &quot; This was perhaps the worst feature of the Congressadministration in matters educational. It is particularly noticeable in the deliberate evasion of their promises to Nawabzada Liaqat Ali Khan and the muslim League, notwithstanding that these promises were recorded in writingand that the Director of Public Instruction insistently reminded the Ministryof these promises and sought to give effect to them.&quot; The Director of PublicInstruction also severely castigates the Congress High Command for theirinterference in educational affairs in the Province. The Educational Minister,he says, never knew from one day to another when he would have to revise orcancel his previous orders at the dictation of either the Prime Minister or theCongress High Command. This resulted in hesitation, procrastination andconfusion. Enquiries were started only to be stopped, questionnaires issued onlyto be pigeon-holed, estimates prepared only to be scrapped. Thus, though it isreported that the period of the Congress Ministry was one of keenness, energy and hope, their work was doomed to frustration and disappointment on accountof lack of experience, especially in finance.34. The attitude of the Bombay Ministry shows a sharp contrast to thatof the Central Provinces. The Bombay Primary Education Act, 1938, &quot; a good and courageous measure,&quot; almost exactly followed departmental advice, in spiteof the fact that it was unwelcome to influential sections of the Ministry&apos;ssupporters in the country districts. This Act transferred the powers of -appointment and transfer of teachers under local authorities to the administrative officers, who were made Government servants. It vested in Government full control over the inspecting staff and circumscribed the powers of school boards.The Act has curtailed the nepotism which had previously obtained, and whichwas so marked a feature in the previous Administration, and both inspecting staff and teachers have been able to carry out their duties more efficiently.35. With respect to other classes of legislation there is little to say. Theoutput of industrial measures was notably small, but such as there were, forexample, the sugar control and power alcohol measures in the United Provinces,have received commendation from the Governors. Little was done with regardto State aid to industries, barring an unimportant Act in Madras, but this is nodoubt due to the fact that previous Governments had made ample legislative provision for this purpose. In view of their intense desire to obtain a grip on indian labour, the Congress output of labour legislation was negligible in quantity if not in quality. A Maternity Benefit Bill was passed in the united provinces, to bring that Province into line with other industrial areas, and the bombay Industrial Disputes Act, 1938, in the Governor &apos;s words, &quot; canunreservedly be described as beneficial.&quot; It has led to a big decrease in thenumber of strikes, the number of cases brought, to conciliation has risen rapidly and industry under war&apos;conditions is proceeding smoothly despite the unlimiteddemand for production and rising prices. Bombay was also responsible for another much needed measure, the Bombay Shops and Establishments Act, 1939,the purpose of which was the relation of hours and working conditions of shop[246651 &apos;   :c
assistants and commercial employees. The Act is said to have&apos;largely achievedits aim. A similar Act has been passed in Bengal, so that this &apos;&apos; notableexperiment &quot;in social legislation cannot be called a Congress monopoly. It isreported that both these Bombay Acts are imperfect and require amendment, butthe principles appear to be sound.36. As already indicated, the Congress Ministries were responsible forpassing a large number of non-controversial measures, and they did not hesitate to amend their own measures when necessity arose. They also passed several important fiscal Acts, to which reference will be made in the section dealing Withfinance. Reviewed as a whole the Congress legislation, save in.a few cases, didnot lead to major difficulties in administration. It is true that amendments hadto be made in several cases by the Section 93 Governments to make measuresworkable, but probably this would have been undertaken by the Ministriesthemselves had they remained in office. The Section 93 regimes honoured the commitments of their predecessors. Not only did they not reverse theirpolicy, but, however much they may have disliked it, they took stepswherever necessary to validate measures; for example, the prohibition in Bombayand Madras. In Bihar several amendments were made to tenancy and debtlegislation to remedy genuine grievances and to make administration more easy,but in only one case in the Central Provinces was it found necessary to repeala Congress measure. This was the Political Prisoners Act, which was foundunworkable owing to the recrudescence of civil disobedience at the beginning of1940.     ..37. With regard to the effect of Congress legislation on the work of thecivil services, the Governors&apos; reports are practically all on the same lines. TheCongress regimes led to a very heavy increase of work in both the secretariat and district offices, but this did not arise from legislation. Except perhaps in Bihar,where the tenancy legislation led to so much work in connection With appeals thatan amending Act had to be made by the succeeding Government, no more increasein work was caused by new legislation sponsored by Congress than would haveaccrued from legislation by any other Ministry. Some Ministries showed a dis-position to niggardliness in increasing staff. This was the case in Bihar, but theGovernor of Bombay points out that, whatever additional staff was required, itwas provided. The extra work caused by the administrative projects and policies of the Congress Ministries, of course, lessened the ability of the district staffs to cope with work arising from new legislation..38. There is nothing in the Governors&apos; reports to show that the congress ministries made any attempt to stifle discussion in the Legislatures. In most ofthe Congress Provinces the Opposition parties, or rather groups, were weak, andnaturally at times felt a sense of frustration at the overwhelming power of themajority. The Ministries were also prone to settle everything before they came to the House, but this is by no means unknown in other forms of democratic government. In some cases, for example, in Bihar, the Ministry were given todiscussing their measures with interested groups prior to introducing them in theAssembly, but this is an instrument of old standing in India, which previousGovernments used with advantage almost as a. matter of routine. In some cases there were signs that the caucus system of the Congress was leading to the inevitable back-bencher protests which in due course would doubtless have provedcorrective, but on the whole it is true that the Congress Ministries observed theparliamentary proprieties, even though at times they showed the intolerance andhaste which are almost inevitable consequences of overwhelming and undisputedpower. The Select Committee system was regularly used, and the committees were formed on a party basis, sometimes overweighted in favour of the minorities;there is evidence to show, as, for example, in the case of the Madras Sales Bill,that the Select Committees did very useful work.Effect of Congress Ministries on Administration.39. The Governors are practically unanimous in reporting that, while therewas little or no formal alteration in the secretariat procedure, there were manyinformal changes, the effect of which was a deterioration in the standard of work.A possible exception was Madras, where the changes were fewer than elsewhereowing to Mr. Raj agopalachari&apos;s desire for a firm administration. The governor of Bombay has forwarded a number of illustrative reports from DepartmentalSecretaries, all of which show that, in spite of some restiveness, the Ministers asa rule adhered to the Rules of Business and the Secretariat Instructions.   So far
as the Petition Rules were concerned, however, secretariat procedure &quot; was com-pletely set at naught, and everybody could write direct to the Minister concerned.&quot;40. This tendency to permit direct approach to individual Ministers seemsto. have been universal under the 1935 Constitution, whether or not the Ministersprofessed the Congress creed. They shared the idea that, as servants of thepeople, they should be directly accessible to them either in person or through the postal system, or by both. This laudable, if impracticable, object worked its owncure, for it is reported by several Governors that, towards the end of their tenures,Ministers were tending to revert to the established practice of having petitionssubmitted through the recognised official channels. The granting of interviewswas as much a heritage from the old regime as a newly found instrument of democracy. For many years prior to 1935, and also 1919, it was an establishedcustom of officials, from Members of Council downwards, to permit direct access to all who wished interviews. In Bengal, for example, till the terrorists convertedthe Secretariat into a minor fortress, Members of Council, Secretaries, Deputy andUnder-Secretaries used to receive anyone who wished to call; rajah or ryot, punditor peon, could interview a Member of Council by the simple process of askingaccess through the chaprassi at the door. There was no barrage of minor officials to discourage such interviews.41. The Congress accessibility had several causes. In the first place, theywere so saturated with suspicion of the bureaucracy and the Ministries of theprevious regime that they thought every file a repository of stratagems and plots.In the second place, they wished to proselytize by demonstrating the extent towhich they were ready to serve the people. No complaint was too petty to be noticed, and no official too big to be overridden. They wished it to be known thatthe Ministers, not the Services, were responsible for the administration. InMadras the Rules of Business were formally amended to make it clear that a secretary to Government was the administrative head of a Department, of whichthe Minister was the official chief. In Orissa orders were issued that all instructtions, verbal or written, given by a Minister direct to local officers, whether on amatter within his own portfolio or not, were to be obeyed immediately as orders of Government.   These orders were later withdrawn.42. The work of the Secretariats was everywhere enormously increased andtheir routine upset, not only by Ministers failing to perform their departmentalduties at regular hours and their short-circuiting the recognised rules of pro^cedure, but also because of the enormous spate of schemes and proposals which ministers wished to put forward to justify their claims as saviours of the people.The Departments were given neither the staffs nor the time to deal with many ofthe schemes, which, in the old days, they could have disposed of temporarily bycirculating to the districts and interested parties for criticism. This slow and deliberate stride did not suit the eager new social democrats. Impatient of control,and champing against time, they wished to jump all hurdles at once. They soonlearned by their mistakes. If their schemes were not deflated by departmentalcriticisms, they were, as in the case of the Vidya Mandir plan in the central provinces, wrecked on financial rocks. The Ministers came to learn the value of departmental advice, and more than one Prime Minister confessed to the Governorbefore resigning that he found the Secretariat officials were his best friends.43. Nearly all the Governors say that the worst offenders against the rules of Business were Parliamentary Secretaries. Parliamentary Secretaries were appointed for two reasons : one, to satisfy Party followers; the other, to take someof the heavy burdens arising from interviews, direct complaints and interference in petty details of administration, from ministerial shoulders. Governors,Ministers, and Secretaries found it difficult to build up satisfactory conventionsdefining the functions, Parliamentary Secretaries were apt to arrogate to themselves the powers and duties of fully-fledged Ministers and wished to pryinto every file. Their most heinous offence was breach of official secrecy. Boundneither by oath of office, nor by the Official Secrets Act, they spread abroad the contents of files irrespective of their confidential or secret markings. the ministries were not in office sufficiently long for Parliamentary Secretaries to beplaced in their proper perspective, but in most cases their powers were graduallyrouted into more or less correct channels..44.   Ministers tended also to disregard departmental boundaries.  Sir RogerLumley&apos;s report, for example, indicates that the border lines between portfolioswere not rigidly observed.  In some cases this was due to the Ministries carrying[24665] . c 2
&quot;passengers&quot; Ministers appointed for communal or Party purposes who hadnot the ability to carry through their own departmental measures. This weakness,however, cannot be laid at the Congress door alone, for similar instances could befound in non-Congress Provinces. The same is true of at least two more traitsreported by the Governors one, a tendency, as in the case of the Madras Minister,Mr. Prakasam, to show files to outsiders; the other, interference in minor appoint-jnents. In Bengal, for example, appointments and transfers of minor officialshave really become as much a matter of major policy as they were in the united provinces. Nor is the appointment of Party supporters without the intervention of a Public Services Commission, as in the Rural Development schemes of theUnited Provinces, entirely a Congress characteristic.45. The work of District Officers was heavily increased by the congress ministries. Apart from such share as he had in examining the numerous schemesof Ministers, and carrying them out, the District Officer was harassed byattending Ministers on tours usually of a propaganda character and theactivities of Congress committees, particularly in respect of complaints. his authority was considerably undermined by personal interference by theMinisters, who passed orders over his head. In several Provinces, especially inBihar, Ministers showed a disinclination to provide extra staff when it was obviously necessary. As part of the High Command policy, Ministries eitherabolished honorary magistrates and other honorary officials or replaced them by.Party men who were mostly of little use, and sometimes of doubtful integrity.Similarly, experienced Public Prosecutors and Government Leaders had to make room for lawyers whose political record was more important than forensic skill.All this not only added to the heavy burdens of the stipendiary magistracy, butled to a deterioration in the administration of justice.46. On the other hand, the Ministries did not blindly follow old Congressslogans. In no case, for example, did they adopt the old Congress theory ofthe separation of executive and judicial powers. In Madras Mr. Raj agopalacharirefused to place the Provincial administration under the High Court, and inthe United Provinces the Ministry side-tracked separation by referring the matter to a committee and a special officer, whose report was conveniently shelved. TheUnited Provinces Ministry, however, had a comprehensive programme for curbingthe powers of the district magistracy by means of District Advisory Councils,which were prevented from seeing the light of day by their resignation.47. The Congress Ministries learned much in their short term of office, andthe Governors&apos; reports suggest that, had it been longer, the suspicion which was at the root of their distrust of Secretariat procedure would have evaporated. as time went on they found that official rules and conventions had a solid basis of fact, and that Secretaries and Heads of Departments were honest professionalworkmen ready to give impartial advice to Congress or non-Congress Ministers,to Governors, Service Chiefs or to the public. Thus, though at first there was some trouble over the old-established practice of Secretaries seeing the Governorsseparately, the Ministers soon dropped their suspicions that Governors wereobtaining information not available to them. Not even the Congress Junta couldconvince them that the procedure was wrong. It would also seem to be the case that no Ministry created trouble over the Rule of Business arising fromSection 59 (3) of the Act, which requires Ministers and Secretaries to transmitto the Governor &quot; all such information with respect to the business of theProvincial Government as may be specified in the Rules, or as the Governor may otherwise require to be so transmitted, and in particular requiring the ministers to bring to the notice of the Governor, and the appropriate Secretary to bring to the notice of the Minister concerned and of the Governor, any matter underconsideration by him which involves or appears to him likely to involve anyspecial responsibility to the Governor.&quot; Ill-disposed Ministers could have forcedmany constitutional dead-locks on this rule, and the fact that they did not is perhaps less a tribute to the Governors and the Services than an index to the factthat, in spite of the High Command, the Congress Ministries were approachinga point very little short of whole-hearted co-operation with the new Constitution.General Repute of Congress Ministries.48. Except in the Central Provinces, the general repute of the congress ministries was high. Their integrity was never seriously brought into question.In Madras, as time went on, there were some mutterings about corruption, and inBihar there were stories about contracts being given to relations, which were
probably apocryphal and exaggerated. There were individual instances of lowpersonal repute, for example, Nurie, Bombay, and Sharif, Central Provinces, bothof whom were suspected of corruption in respect of both money and women. Itis perhaps significant that each was a Muslim Quisling.49. The Ministries all appear to have been mixed teams. Not being in aposition to command support from the Muslim League, the Premiers were forcedto take in Muslim turncoats of inferior calibre, who were distrusted both bytheir colleagues and by their co-religionists. Outwardly the Ministries were&quot;united and happy families,&quot; but by the time they resigned the strain ofworking together in some cases, e.g., in Bombay, was well-nigh overwhelming.Most of them, as Sir Roger Lumley says of the Bombay Ministers, were undoubtedly inspired by a sense of duty, but as against this they were &apos;&apos; out to.promote the Party interests of Congress.&quot; They achieved most success wherethe authority of the Premier was undisputed, as in Madras, Orissa and the North-,West Frontier Province. In Bombay, &quot; Kher&apos;s strength lay in his undoubtedlyhigh character, devotion to Mr. Gandhi, and subservience to the high command,&quot; but his Ministry had divided Congress loyalties. Munshi, forexample, was a creature of Vallabhbhai Patel. A similar rift was observed inthe Central Provinces Ministry, which also suffered from territorial antagonisms the antagonism between the Mahakoshal (Hindi-speaking) and MarathaProvinces, in each of which there were minor rivalries. In the central provinces, too, the stronger men fell out among themselyes. Khare fought withMisra, and Shukla, &quot;obstinate, tactless, intolerant and, above all, communal,&quot;did not find it easy to agree with anyone. Only one Central Province Minister Deshmukh-an ex-Dyarchy Minister, did not lose his reputation. The central provinces Ministry was also vindictive, as in the case of its vendetta against thelate Mr. Raghavendra Rao. It was guilty of nepotism and &quot;worse things.&quot;Vindictiveness was shown by individual Ministers in other Provinces. Forexample, Desai, in Bombay, an ex-official, who had resigned in the first non-co-operation movement, was particularly vindictive towards Government servants.50. In some Provinces, though there were no outward signs of dissension,there were internal divisions arising from differences in policy. CongressCabinets had their Right and Left Wings, and in most cases disruption wasperiodically threatened by internal intrigues, as in the case of Misra in theCentral Provinces and Prakasam in Madras. In most cases the Governor hadto preside at Cabinet meetings to keep order and expedite business, but this isalso true of non-Congress Bengal. On the whole, there was nothing unusuallydistinctive in the Congress Ministries. There were dissensions and controversies,there was personal ambition and intrigue; in the non-Congress Ministries inIndia, as there have been and will continue to be in Ministries under anyparliamentary system. The most remarkable thing about the Congress Ministriesis that they were able to maintain unity for so long as 2^ years. Except in theCentral Provinces the record is a triumph for the Congress High command the financial record of Congress Ministries.51. Whatever may be the views of the Governors on the repute of theCongress Ministries in other respects, their reports show that there is no question that, in all Provinces save one, the finances were well handled. The exceptionis Orissa, where the Ministry&apos;s policy was coloured by a political bias againstthe Financial Settlement under the 1935 Act, which they felt was unfair to theProvinces generally and to Orissa in particular. The Ministry accordinglydeliberately budgeted for deficits. Actually, the deficits did not arise, as lumpsums were included in the budgets at random for schemes that never came intooperation. East year, in fact, showed a surplus, so that the credit of the Provincewas not seriously jeopardized. With respect to the other Provinces, the governors&apos; reports are uniformly favourable. &quot; Judged from a financialstandpoint,&quot; writes Sir Arthur Hope, &quot;there is no doubt that the credit ofthe Province continued to be sound during the period for which the Congress&apos; Ministry was responsible for its administration.&quot; The Ministry adhered to the recognised canons of finance, and its financial administration generally seemsto have been quite praiseworthy. In Bombay, Sir Roger Lumley writes, &apos;&apos; TheFinance Acts were broadly orthodox, and the insistence of the Ministry onbalancing its budgets was commendable.&quot; In the United Provinces, Sir MauriceHallett says, &quot; Generally speaking, the finances of the Province fared well underthe Congress Ministry, and the actual results compared very favourably with
those of preceding years/&apos; In Bihar, Sir Thomas Stewart reports: &quot;In one important sense the Congress Ministry is entitled to the credit of having adopted. an orthodox and cautious policy in handling the finances of the Province. Theyadhered to the salutary rule that normal expenditure should be met by normalrevenues, and they made no attempt to encroach on the free Provincial balances.&quot;Even in the Central Provinces, the Ministry is given credit for good work. &quot; Themost competent work done by the Ministry,&quot; writes the Governor, &quot; was probablyits handling of Provincial finances, except perhaps in its attitude towards thecollection of land revenue.&quot; He goes on to say that the Ministry was not opento serious criticism in its financial administration proper, except in respect,of failing to make provision for implementing its prohibition policy. In theNorth-West Frontier Province, Sir George Cunningham says that, generallyspeaking, &quot; the financial position of the Province was satisfactorily maintained by the Ministry. . . . The essential principles of budgeting were maintained.&quot;52. In all the Provinces the Finance Department was respected and upheldin the ordinary business of administration. Where most of the Ministries failedto live up to the standards of their predecessors was in introducing new schemestoo hastily without giving the Departments time for detailed examination. Thisover-budgeting for political window-dressing, however, led to no serious results,as the lump sum provisions inserted in the budgets could not be spent in thefinancial year.53. Although their tenure of office was not sufficiently long to provide a test of long-term financial policy, it is clear that the aim of the congress ministries was to shift the incidence of the tax burden from the peasants to theeconomically stronger section of the people, particularly town-dwellers. In thisway they hoped to secure greater equality of sacrifice, and in some measure theyachieved their object. *It is unfortunate that the Finance Ministers werehampered by Gandhi&apos;s obsession for prohibition, for excise revenue is one ofthe major heads of income in every Province. How far they regarded the lossof this income as permanent is not clear, but there is evidence to show that theywere not keen on making estimates of the financial effects of total prohibitionin each Province. In some cases the experiments were cunningly introduced in areas where the excise revenue was smallest, and it seems not improbable that,had the impact of the financial loss been on a provincial and not on a districtbasis, the Finance Ministers might have taken a stronger hand in the matter.54. As land revenue is the most important receipts head in all Provinces,the Congress policy of favouring the ryot against the landlord in course of time would have led to very heavy reductions in this vital source of revenue, and an analysis of the new fiscal measures introduced gives an idea of how the ministries proposed to offset the losses. Tinkering with existing sources ofrevenue would not have recouped land revenue losses, nor would retrenchment.A major source of income would be necessary, and it appears that the Ministriesexpected to find this in Sales taxes, the initial steps for the introduction of whichwere taken in several Provinces. In Bombay an important experiment wasmade in the imposition of an Immovable Property tax. Imposed ostensibly toto make up for loss in excise revenue, it was estimated to yield a crore of rupeesper annum. This tax, incidentally, was an encroachment on the traditionalrights of local authorities, who at the same time were encouraged by the BombayMinistry to tax themselves. In the Central Provinces a tax on trades andprofessions was introduced, but an ambitious proposal of the United Provincesto introduce an employments tax was vetoed by the Governor on the ground thatit was a veiled attack on the Services. The Bihar Ministry succeeded in introducing a financial measure of major importance in the Agricultural IncomeTax Act, 1938. This Act made agricultural income liable to tax, and was stoutlyopposed by the,landlords on the grounds that it was contrary to the terms of thePermanent Settlement. The validity of the tax was challenged in the courts,but it was upheld both in the Patna High Court and in the Federal Court. the tax has added to the financial embarrassments of the landlords, but, as Sir ThomasStewart says, outside the ranks of the landlords themselves there are few whowill contend that it is not a reasonable and equitable measure.55. -Smaller sources of revenue were tapped by most of the Ministries.Stamp duties and court fees were increased. Entertainment taxes were imposedor increased. Taxes were imposed on private motor cars, motor spirit and poweralcohol. Tobacco duties were imposed or increased, so also were electricitytaxes. In individual Provinces, Ministers searched for pickings from other taxes.
In Bombay, one of the most important racing centres of India, an annual levyof Us. 3 lakhs was imposed on the Royal Western Indian Turf Club. This impostwas accompanied by two conditions: one, that certain minimum percentages ofthe stake money, increasing annually, should be allotted to country-bred horses;the other, that certain facilities should be provided for training Indian lads asjockeys. This measure is said to be &quot; working admirably.&quot; The Bombay Ministryalso made provision for the taxation of prize competitions,, such as cross-wordpuzzles and picture puzzles.5.6. On the other side of the account, reduction in expenditure, the congress ministries had no time to achieve the dramatic effects which their electionpromises had led the people to expect. In some instances the subject of generalretrenchment was under reference to committees when the Ministries resigned.The major field of potential retrenchment the Imperial Services-was outsidethe Ministries&apos; powers, but they were quick to set about the Services over whichthey had control. Reduced scales of pay were prescribed, and travelling allow-ances were stopped. In some oases the Ministries indulged in a sort of negativeretrenchment by refusing to provide for much-needed improvements in officialquarters, as in the case&apos;of the police accommodation in Bihar. The Ministerssubjected themselves to the most spectacular cuts of pay. . In the previous regimeMinisters had been paid the same rates as Members of Council, but Congressdecreed that. Congressmen should take only Rs. 500 a month. This reduction was more apparent than real, for Ministers soon ascertained that their salarieswere inadequate for their position. They had to be recompensed in kind : theywere given free official residences, in some cases extravagantly fitted out astrange contrast to their reluctance to give brick and mortar grants for otherofficial purposes; and they also got free motor cars and other perquisites, which made up their total emoluments to a sum not incomparable with the salaries paidin non-Congress Provinces. Whether the sacrificial gesture of ministerial povertywas justified in the event or not, or whether it could have been maintained, there,appears to be no doubt that on-the whole it did not adversely affect ministerialintegrity, and it is equally certain that it had a not immaterial impact on the scales prescribed for themselves by Ministers in non-Congress Provinces.57. In some cases Ministries were guilty of &quot;serious relaxation&quot; of thecanons and proprieties of ministerial procedure. For example, in Bihar therewas a tendency to anticipate the vote of the legislature in sanctioning expenditure.In the United Provinces the Finance Minister retained in his own hands thepower of sanction in even petty matters. This, as the Governor suggests, mayhave arisen from &quot; a too jealous regard for Provincial finances.&quot; In the North-West Frontier Province the Ministry indulged a passing fancy by investingProvincial funds in a local sugar company, a venture which, however, has not been entirely unsuccessful.58. On the whole, however, the Congress financial record is sound. In no case did the Ministries seriously depress the credit of their Provinces. They hada healthy regard for Exchequer control, and their more flamboyant schemes didlittle more harm than to inflate the estimates and to produce unforeseen surpluses.In finance, as in other things, the conclusion may fairly be drawn that, but forthe cantrips of the High Command, the Ministries would have achieved resultsof abiding value.Law and Order under Congress Ministries.59. Communal tension, including the encouragement of sectarianantipathies, as between the Sunis and Shias in the United Provinces, agrarianagitation, labour and factional disputes, led to much disorder in the Congress,Provinces, the handling of which varied from firm determination-in Bombay-to lamentable weakness as in the case of the students&apos; strikes-in Orissa. in bombay, it is reported, the Ministry showed no signs of being inhibited by itselection pledges from firm and,vigorous action. Where necessary it displayedforce, and used it. Though the general orders governing the administration of order suffered from an excess of legalism, nevertheless the Home Minister was always in favour of the maximum use of force. In Madras, Sir Arthur Hopesays that as a general principle it can be safely laid down that the Congress.Government took strong measures to deal with any form of lawlessness, and,generally speaking, local officials received a full measure of support. In theNorth-West Frontier Province the Ministry supported local officers in suddenemergencies, though they had a weakness for subsequent committees of enquiry.
They were prompt and firm in dealing with agrarian disorders. In Bihar theMinistry &quot; oame up to the scratch &quot; in sudden emergencies, and refused, requests for enquiries into local shooting incidents. They were ready, indeed, relieved,to give local officers a free hand.60. In the United Provinces, the Central Provinces, and also to some extent in other Provinces, the Ministries interfered with local officers, and, particularlyin the first to Provinces, undermined morale by their ready acceptance of directcomplaints. The Central Provinces Ministry issued circulars reaffirming standing orders and assuring officers that they would be supported in all legitimate action they might take, but, it is reported, &quot; the position remained that district officerstended to regard them as mere lip-service to administrative propriety, and stilldoubted whether any action taken by them in any communal disturbance wouldnot result in a visitation of Ministers already supplied with information privatelyacquired from their supporters, who themselves might have been involved in the.trouble.&quot; Later on in their career the Central Provinces Ministry were againstgiving a free hand to: district officials, though basically they did realise the needfor backing up the man on the spot. Possibly, says the report, &quot; if the ministry had had a longer life in which to overcome the initial exuberance of power andthe tendency to appear on every occasion to enforce an Olympian settlement, theissue of the circular might have been a first step towards a more dispassionateand objective view of their responsibilities towards the maintenance of law andorder.&quot;61. In Madras also, in spite of their general competence, the Ministers were inclined not to accept the reports of local officers, whom they were also apt to criticise in public. Along with this tendency &apos;&apos; the Ministry combined a very realmeasure of severity against law breakers.&quot;62. The Congress Ministries were all extremely sensitive to disturbances,for they were well aware that Congress had encouraged movements, such as theKisan agitation in the United Provinces and Bihar, and the Red Shirt movementin the North-West Frontier Province, that were likely to rebound on their ownheads. In the Central Provinces, where the fall in revenue collection was a directresult of Congress propaganda, the Ministers had to adopt counter-propaganda ofan entirely contrary character. The release of political prisoners also had an adverse effect on public order, and, if not in public, Ministers privately confessed,in Sir Thomas Stewards words, &quot; that some of these men were no better thanordinary criminals, and that their so-called patriotism was mere eye-wash.&quot;The Congress policy of encouraging indiscipline in educational institutions alsogave Ministers in some Provinces many anxious hours, during which theydoubtless came to realise the burdens they had placed on their predecessors aswell as on college and school authorities.63. The worst feature of the Congress regime, however, was deterioration in the morale of subordinate officials, particularly the police, owing to the deliberate policy of lowering their prestige and influence in the eyes of the people.As Sir Maurice BCallett has said, reporting a Commissioner^ view, &quot; the averagesub-inspector did not know whether he was subordinate to his own superintendentor to the local M.L.A.&quot; Not only did the Ministers or local Congress officialsinterfere with investigations, but also at the same time parallel investigationswere conducted. As a United Provinces Commissioner wrote : &quot;I do notthink that there can be any doubt that this (i.e., persecuting and threateningsubordinate officers) w&amp;s an essential feature of the Congress policy, togetherwith the inauguration of a sort of Soviet system of Panchayats or Mandals bywhich parallel machinery might be brought into being, so enabling.Congress tohold its own and to defeat the Constitutional Government in any future struggleor non-co-operation with the latter.&apos;&apos;64. This deterioration in police morale encouraged the criminal classes,with the result that, almost as soon as the Congress party came into office, therewas a marked increase in crime of all kinds in the United Provinces, eventhough economic conditions were not unfavourable. It is suspected, too, that much crime was unreported, as the victims were persuaded not to pursue theircomplaints before the police but to refer them to local Congress officials.Criminals also took full advantage of the agrarian agitation sponsored by congress, and came to look upon themselves as enjoying a privileged position, a claim which was to some extent substantiated by the reluctance of subordinateofficials to proceed against them.
65. That the Congress atmosphere was responsible for the rise in crime inthe United Provinces is shown by the &quot;fact that, on the resignation of the Ministry,there was an immediate improvement. The Khaksar agitation immediately dieddown. &quot;An immediate and absolute calm followed the disastrous communalcommotion of the Congress regime,&quot; as one Commissioner wrote. Agrariantension also ceased, largely owing to Government servants realising that theywould. receive support from headquarters.66. The same story is told of Bihar, where crime figures increased owingto a progressive diminution of respect for law and authority. The policeundoubtedly felt, says Sir Thomas Stewart, that the Ministry was, if not actuallyhostile to them, at least prejudiced against them, and that they could not rely on receiving the support of Government in dealing with delinquents. &apos;&apos; Constantinterference in petty matters of police administration and numerous demands for explanations and reports contributed towards the undermining of theauthority and morale of the police, and this indirectly encouraged lawlesselements.&quot; Relaxation of gaol discipline also had a bad effect on peace and order,while the Kisan agitation led to an increase in agrarian crime, although this was partly an inheritance from the past.67. There was also a steep rise in the crime statistics of the North-west frontier Province, though.this was mainly due to the turbulence fostered by theCongress and Red Shirts during the previous years. The Ministry was verykeen on preserving order and put no obstacles in the way of the police, the morale of which was unimpaired indeed, Sir George Cunningham says that the reputation of the police for honesty and impartiality never stood higher. TheMinistry, however, was responsible for several measures which encouragedlawlessness. For one thing, they alienated the Khans, who, surly and resentfulat the blows dealt to their pockets and prestige by the Cabinefs policy, would not readily co-operate with the police. Also, on the theory that every voter has theright to carry a gun licence, the Ministry was responsible for an enormousincrease in the number of licences for firearms. A more dangerous developmentwas the increasing number of semi-military organisations associated with political parties and the increasing habit of carrying weapons as political symbols at public meetings, fairs and other crowded places. With this menace and also the increasing virulence of speakers, at public meetings, the Ministry, if they hadthe will, had not the courage to cope.68. With regard to strikes and natural calamities there is little to note.Posing as champions of the proletariat, the Congress Ministers had a politicalbias in favour of wage-earners, but in industrial disputes they endeavoured tohold the balance evenly. In important strikes, as in Cawnpore (where theemployers are as difficult to handle as the workers) they tried to solve their-difficulties by appointing committees of enquiry or conciliation, of the neutralcomposition of which there was sometimes a little doubt. When the committees or the labour officers of Government failed, the Ministers, particularly the PrimeMinister, did not hesitate to intervene, not without success. On the whole,Sir Maurice Hallett thinks that his Ministry handled the Cawnpore strikes with considerable skill and tact, and that the recommendations which they made were,on the whole, reasonable.69. In Bombay, where conciliation machinery was more highly advanced in1937 than in any other Congress Province, strikes were firmly handled; indeed,in one case, a strike at Ahmedabad instigated by Communists,, the situation was&quot; particularly rigorously handled.&quot; In Madras, where there was a big increasein strikes soon after they took office, the Ministry adopted a sound attitude.Every dispute was enquired into, and if the Labour Minister himself was unableto settle it he appointed courts of enquiry, the personnel of which was chosen froma wide field, all of whom were likely to be neutral.70. As regards natural calamities, of which there were fortunately fewfrom 1937 to 1939, there is little to be said. The Ministries used the existing machinery quickly, solicitously and competently. They were content to let theDistrict Officers carry on. In some cases, perhaps, they were a little too generousin -remissions or grants, but their generosity in no case caused financialembarrassment. Sir Roger Lumley makes a special note of the Bombay Ministry&apos;scompetence.in dealing with sudden emergencies in the field of public health.[24665] &quot;   d
Relations of Congress Ministries ivith the Services.71. The Governors have examined certain aspects of this subject in consider-able detail, but in most oases their analysis is somewhat superficial, and their conclusions are by no means uniform. The &quot; Services &quot; include much more thanthe Law and Order Services, with which alone the Governors&apos; commentaries deal.It is not without significance that the technical Services Irrigation, PublicWorks, Education and Medical are not referred to at all except in the general sense that they were subject to the same retrenchments as the others. All these services had been provincialised. Only remnants of the old Imperial Servicesremain, and, in any case, the Indian politician has never seriously quarrelled withhis professional or technical advisers. He objects, of course, to Europeans holdingposts for which he thinks Indians are qualified; but he is more concerned with good professional advice than with race, and, moreover, feels that anyhow the europeans&apos; course is nearly run.72. The Services, too, are composed of different grades Imperial, Provin-cial and Subordinate. The Ministries did not reach the point of attacking theImperial Services as a whole. The Government of Madras, it is true, proposed reductions in their scales of pay, and several Provinces either proposed, or were about to propose, the abolition of, or a reduction in, the posts of Commissioner:The Congress attack was concentrated on the &quot; Peace and Order Services,&quot; the&quot; ruling &quot; Services which were within their own competence. In spite of theDyarchy, the average. Indian politician has not been able to disabuse his mind of the obsession that the I.C.S. is the ruler of India. To him it is the Government;to the Congress politician it also represents alien control. The Police Services,and also the Provincial and Subordinate Executive Services, are looked on asmerely its creatures. The Congress policy of undermining these Services wastherefore a cardinal point in their programme. The Ministers were mostlyinexperienced in administration. They did not, or would not, realise that a district Officer, I.C.S., is as much a servant of Government as an IrrigationEngineer or an Inspector of Schools, and that it is his function not to govern, butto carry on the administration according to the laws and orders of Government.In time the Ministers came to realise this, for practically every Governor reportsthat, with experience,,the Congress attitude changed. It is not unreasonable todeduce that, if the Ministers had gained still more experience, the Service impassewould have solved itself.73. In the smaller Provinces relations between the Ministers and theServices were more cordial and successful than in the larger. In Orissa, forexample, Service morale is reported to have been high. There was novictimisation, and relations between the officials and.the Ministers were saidto be good. The same is true of the North-West Frontier Province. There bothsocial and political relations were good. In spite of the High Commandinjunction against social contacts, hospitality was freely exchanged. In both these Provinces the Ministries carried out the general Congress policy ofretrenchment, and were also apt to spread the idea that Congress had to be looked to more than Service chiefs for advancement. They also tended to short-circuitofficial routine in dealing with complaints, but, as Sir Hawthorne Lewis says,such action was perhaps more hasty than ill-intentioned. In any case, in eachProvince it was only a passing phase.74. In the larger Provinces the story is very different. Coming into power with a strong bias against the Services, the Ministries determined to lose no time in putting them in their proper places. They could not touch theSecretary of State&apos;s Services except by irritating and vexatious methods ofoverriding them, humiliating them in public, refusing to have social relationswith them, and generally lowering their prestige and influence. But in the caseof the unprotected Services they reduced scales of pay, cut travelling and other allowances, irrespective of the effect on administration, reduced or abolishedspecial pensions and refused the right to commutation.75. But it was not so much their pockets as their prestige that the Ministriesattacked. As Sir Maurice Hallett says, the Congress theory of government implied that the citizen had the right of direct access to Ministers. Translated intopractice, this meant encouragement of the idea that the Ministers, as servants of the people, were ready to look into every complaint that might come to them.The result was that a large number of enquiries were set afoot into the conductof Government servants on the flimsiest allegations.   These Were sent on to the
districts for examination, but the enquiries did not end there. Often localinquisitions were conducted by Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries, or evenordinary M.L.A.s. Under such circumstances Government servants could not do-other than lose confidence/ They felt they would not be supported againstunfounded charges, especially as, if the charge was substantiated, the punishmentwas savage, whereas, if it was not, no action was taken against the complainant,76. The local Congress officials played a leading part in making orreceiving these complaints, and their action was all the more galling becauseof the type of person involved. Some of them were men of high ideals, but others were what Sir Maurice Hallett calls small political touts. &quot;These men,&quot; he says, &quot; set themselves up as little dictators. They gave out that nothing couldbe accomplished except through them, and they made their living and spenttheir lives exploiting grievances, real or imaginary. In some districts the localParty leaders felt themselves entitled to interfere in details of administration,and there was at one time some risk of the establishment of Party organisationsparallel with and arrogating to themselves the duties of the Governmentadministrative system.&quot; .77. The anti-corruption campaigns of the Congress also were a severe shock to the Services, not because of a feeling of self-righteousness on their part, but because of the encouragement by the Ministers of an unbridled right of makingallegations. Under the previous regimes, the Governments were continuouslycastigated for permitting corruption in the Services. The lower ranks of the.Police, Excise and Registration Services were the main targets, and th&amp;stereotyped reply of Members and Ministers was that if any case of corruptionwere reported and proved, the most condign action would be taken. The congress ministries went far beyond this, and though they succeeded in some measure in stamping out corruption, their methods became instruments of positive torture.In the United Provinces, where the purity crusade was most intense, a specialAnti-Corrupticn Department was set up under, the direct control of the PrimeMinister. After the resignation of the Ministry this department was placed under the Inspector-General of Police, an extract from whose report, quotedbelow, amply confirms Sir Roger Lumley&apos;s remark in this connection that theMinisters&apos; zeal outran their, good sense. &quot;Initially,&quot; says the Inspector-General,&apos;&apos; the underlying motive that actuated the purity campaign may have beenhonest; but it is an undoubted fact that gradually the whole machinery developedinto one for levying financial and political blackmail, and for extorting from government servants subservience to the will of the Congress party.&quot; TheDepartment, he goes on to say, came to be looked on as the Gestapo of the congress party. *&apos;&apos; Even when little or no grounds at all existed for allegations, &quot;searchingenquiries could be. and were made into the private transactions of government servants, which could not fail to cause acute misery and pain. Government -servants remained, months in suspension, and a threat of making a complaintcould always be held over the head of Government servants to bring pressure upon them. Even when there was ground for complaint, the allegation was oftenmade that action was taken in a particular case not primarily because suspicionsof corruption were present, but for extraneous reasons. Muslims in particularfelt that they were, singled out for enquiry,. and the Department was looked upon as part of the Congress party machine.&quot;78. The attack on the prestige and general harassment of the Provincialand Subordinate Services, as Sir Roger Lumley&apos;s report indicates, had twounfortunate results. The first was that many of the best men lost confidence..Their sense of independence, and their qualities of enterprise, initiative andenergy, were sapped, with the result that they &quot; played for safety rather thancreate trouble for themselves.&quot; The other was that &quot; the worst were turned intosecret cringers and toadies to the local representatives of the Party in power,&quot;with the result that a large number of &apos;&apos; yes-men &apos;&apos; made their appearance among-the public servants, anxious to acquire and. maintain the goodwill of theMinisters: &apos;&apos; Public servants were encouraged to see Ministers and Parlia-mentary Secretaries direct, and were permitted to declaim against and animadvertupon the actions of their departmental superiors. The result was that a greatdeal of this backstairs coming and going did go on and became a regular feature of the administration in at least one Government department.&quot; It should,;however, be added that this unfortunate feature was not confined to CongressProvinces.[24665]- -. &apos; e
79. The secret of the Ministries&apos; power over the Services was not so muchtheir control of pay and general conditions of service, but their power of transfer,a bludgeon the effect of which is little realised in this country. As one united provinces Commissioner has put it, &quot; It was felt that any opposition to Congressdesigns, or even failure to support them ^however well-founded from the officialpoint of view would involve frequent expensive transfers or transfer to a lesspleasant station, if nothing worse. And there is no doubt that transfers andso on were often ordered simply as a result of personal contact with ministers and, in vulgar parlance, &apos; wangling.&apos; &quot; The &quot;penal transfer&quot; was, of course,well known long before 1937, but the Congress Ministers reduced its use, or atleast, perhaps, the threat of its use, to a fine art. The transfer,&apos; too, was used as an instrument of nepotism and favouritism, and, in some cases, of communaldiscrimination. More than one Governor has reported instances of questionabletransfers of Muslim officers, with the consequence that there was not only a feeling of injustice among Muslim Government servants, but also ominous signsof communal schisms in the Services.80. The Bombay Ministry, which Sir Roger Lumley says was never ableto emancipate itself from its initial feeling of suspicion of the Services, adopted a peculiar attitude towards promotions. Distrusting the administrative devicesof select lists and confidential reports, they introduced the principle of promotion -by seniority alone to Mamlatdars&apos; and Deputy Collectors&apos; posts, the result ofwhich would have been speedy deterioration in work. This policy does not seemto have been followed by other Congress Ministries. The Bombay Ministry wasalso not free from vindictiveness; as the Bombay, report says, &apos;&apos; like all political parties whose progress to power has been protracted and chequered, the Congress.showed itself to have a long and tenacious memory of the wrongs and slights,real and imaginary, it had suffered in its campaigning days, and there wereMinisters in the Bombay&quot; Cabinet who found it difficult to forget the past. The^consequence was that there were some Collectors of the Provincial Service whofelt themselves directly threatened. . . . There was never anything in the nature-Of a policy of vindictiveness, but there were certain officers who, on account of past brushes with the Congress, particularly during the civil disobedience days,were definitely persona non grata with the Ministry, and sporadic instances ofvindictiveness did occur.&quot; There were stray instances of vindictiveness in other.Provinces, but there is no evidence that on the whole the Congress Ministrieswere more vindictive than Ministries in non-Congress Provinces. The feeling-of vindictiveness against the Services arose largely from the trepidation which followed on the assumption of power by men who, in the past, had broken thelaw and suffered the consequences at the hands of officers whose duty it was tomaintain the law.81. The Congress policy of Ministers avoiding social contact withthe Services does not seem to have been carried out in all cases. as sir Maurice Hallett says, Gandhi imposed the ban on social intercourse betweenthe Governor and Ministers and between Ministers and their permanent staffprimarily because he felt that if really friendly relations existed the ministers would come unduly under the influence of the bureaucracy. He adds that theMinisters themselves would have been very willing to accept, and, as far aspossible, return the hospitality, but that they had not the courage to stand out against the ban. The High Command policy was only a continuation of the banimposed many years before on Congressmen attending official functions, but its application to the new regime was not only inept, but of doubtful value to congress itself. Most Government officers, European and Indian, have personalfriends in the Congress camp, and.it was impossible for any save the mostimplacable extremists to avoid meeting Government officers on social occasions.The Congress policy was bound to break down. In the case of Indians, whereCongressmen and officials were often mixed in the same family group, the policy was foolish in the extreme. A year or two more of Congress office would doubtlesshave demonstrated its complete absurdity. .82. As regards the Imperial Services, what Sir Maurice Hallett says of theUnited Provinces is probably true of the rest. On the I.C.S. and Indian Policethere was little appreciable effect, though the personal factor entered into thematter. &quot; Some officers,&quot;, he says, &quot; were unable to maintain impartiality either because they could not resist pressure brought to bear upon them, or because they thought that their lives would be more comfortable for compliance, but, generallyvspeaking, the Services maintained their morale.&quot;   There can be little doubt,
however, that there was a steady slip in these Services. Many of the Indians were affected by the same influences as undermined tlhe confidence of the unprotectedServices, and it is feared that a number of officers, both Indian and European,became time-servers, whose venality was all the more reprehensible because oftheir privileged position. The Central Provinces report presents a very gloomypicture of the European officers&apos;point of view in these words : &quot;A large numberof the junior European members of the ECS. were merely marking time till theyhad acquired what was considered a sufficient proportionate pension to justify their retirement, a tendency not discouraged by the very generous scale on which such pensions are granted.&quot; Owing to the smaller pensions, the same tendencywas not so observable in the Indian Police, but &quot; the old tendency to regard india as a country of career has almost entirely disappeared, and the general attitude,at least of officers recruited before the Reforms, is to consider themselves as merelyhanding over. This attitude is not solely due to the Ministry; a number of factors have contributed to it- one of the most potent being the increasingdeprivation of compatible society in the districts due to provincialisation.Undoubtedly experience under the Ministry added very strongly to this feeling,and perhaps it is not an over-pessimistic view to say that a large proportion ofthe small remaining number of Europeans especially those not overburdened by financial circumstances will take as early an opportunity as possible of retiring.It is probable that only the war has prevented this tendency being apparentearlier.&quot; The Madras view, perhaps, more correctly defines the view of the All-India Services in these words : &quot; The All-India Services, though on the wholewell treated and continuing to give loyally of tlheir best, were not too happy overthe reduction of special pensions, wholesale retrenchment in the Forest Depart-ment, and had a general feeling that it was only the Governor and the Secretaryof &apos; State&apos;s Rules which stood between them and an attack on their pay and prospects.&quot;83. In the last sentence lies the crux of the Services question, and it is alittle surprising that Governors have not examined its implications more fully,particularly as they are evidently appreciated by the Services themselves. Since1937 the All-India Services have been in the unpleasant position of sitting behindconstitutional defences while their Provincial and Subordinate . confreres havebeen subjected to continuous financial harassment, the effect of which has been to widen the gap between the pay and conditions of the two sets of Services tosuch an extent that in some Provinces the initial pay of the protected Services isonly a few rupees short of the maxima of the others. When the 1935 Act waspassed the Imperial Services pressed for, obtained and appreciated the safe-guards of the Act; but it has provided little pleasure or comfort to them to &quot;sitpretty &apos;&apos; and see the Provincial and other Services overwhelmed by the Congressbarrage. During the Dyarchy they were themselves partly responsible forretrenchment in the pay scales of the unprotected Services, and the. deeperincisions made by Congress inevitably has raised the question as to whether inequity they themselves should continue to enjoy the rate of pay and pensions set by a standard prescribed in the darker ages when officers had to be recompensedfor surrendering private sources of income.84. Several Governors have admitted that the cuts made by the congress ministries were not unreasonable, but only Sir Maurice Hallett has ventured totouch on the implications of the high rates enjoyed by the Imperial Services.These high rates of pay, he says, had always been the subject of criticism, andthere was some justification for the view that the pay necessary for attractingBritish recruits of good quality had unduly influenced the pay of the ProvincialServices. The lowering of the Provincial rates, however, places the high pay ofthe Imperial Services in bolder relief, and there are.few European or indian officers of these Services who feel &apos;happy at the contrast, whether that contrast be between the initial pay of Imperial Services and the maxima of ProvincialServices, or the standard pay of Delhi senior officials about Rs. 4,000 a month which was fixed when the capital was the expensive Calcutta, and what isgenerally regarded as the not unreasonable salaries of the .Bengal Ministers about Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 2,500 a month.85. Most officials agree that there will be no peace with the Indianpolitician, Congress or non-Congress, so long as the present system continues.The Governors all have reported that the distrust, suspicion and animus of theMinisters towards the Services was passing before they resigned; but it cannotdisappear while the economic and constitutional contrasts between, the Services
remain and become more prominent as time goes on. Moreover, the Provincialand Subordinate Services, which in the ordinary course of administration are more closely connected with the man in the street or in the fields than the higherServices, cannot in the nature of things look with joy on the privileges of theuntouchables, and their attitude must sooner or later be communicated to thelaity. Officers of a reflective turn of mind realise that, in spite of their foibles,the Congress Ministries have not been altogether unreasonable. Many of them,indeed, have been surprised at their moderation. Had they cared, the CongressHigh Command could have created a Service impasse within the first year of congress office, which would have forced the hands of the British Government.All they had to do was to refuse supply for some of the essential Provincial andSubordinate Services, and that they did not do so, in spite of a precedent in theearly history of the Bengal Dyarchy, must be written in large letters on the creditside of their account.86. On the Services question, as in most other problems discussed by the governors, the conclusion which flows from their reports is that, while their treat-ment of the officers under their control probably was not worthy of generalapplause, the Ministries gradually learned by experience that the Services did notarrogate to themselves powers which do not by law belong to them, and that theywere ready to offer advice and co-operation in carrying out the Ministries&apos; policies,however much they may have disapproved of them in their own minds. The pettypersecutions, the distrust, the vexatious interference in small matters, undignifiedand humiliating behaviour, all would have passed with the growing appreciation by the Ministers of where the real strength of the administration lay. But noMinistry, Congress or non-Congress, will be allowed by their legislatures to lookwith complacency or equanimity on the central antimony of the 1935 Act, which isthat the Service conditions of the chief instruments in carrying their policy intoeffect are outside their own control.87. This review may be concluded by a quotation from Sir Roger Lumley,which&apos;is applicable to all the Congress Provinces, even the Central Provinces:&quot; My conclusion is,&quot; he writes, &quot; that the Congress performance was certainly not bad, and when one takes into account the strange circumstances of theprevious bitter enemy of Government becoming the Government, and the factthat Ministers, and most legislators, had had practically no previous experienceof their tasks some knew more of jail than of office it was remarkably good and held promise for the future.&quot; But, he adds, whether the performance wouldhave been allowed to continue and to develop into maturity is another matter.The High Command had another aim in view.
