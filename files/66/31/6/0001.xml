(S) (42) 89) was thata new Vickers-designed aircraft with 4 Merlin engines should be introduced, firstat Weybridge, and later, if desired, at Blackpool and Chester, to supersede theWrarwick and the Wellington. The new aircraft is known as the B. 3 /42. Thefirst of the new type should appear in October 1944, and there would be an outputof about 20 a month by the Spring of 1945 rising to 50 a month by the end of theyear.  The last Warwick would be made at Weybridge in July 1945.* W.M. (42) 133rd Conclusions, Minute 1 (i).  .f Annex.[24624]Copy No-
A alternative Proposals.2. The main alternative proposal which has been examined is that theVickers organisation should be switched to the production of Lancasters. TheLancaster is, from every point of view, the most satisfactory heavy bomber nowin production. It is a well-established type and it has been suggested that it couldconsequently be brought into production at Messrs. Vickers much earlier than theB. 3/42, the prototype of which is unlikely to be flying before next Autumn. Anextension of this plan would be the development of a re-designed Lancaster, i.e.,a Lancaster which would be in essentials the same as the present aircraft, butimproved and developed to the maximum extent possible. If tJhis could be evolvedfairly readily, and if it were found to have a performance comparable to thatexpected of the B. 3/42, it could then be introduced both into the Vickersorganisation and elsewhere to replace the present Lancaster at about the same date as that forecasted for the introduction of the B. 3/42.3. A further proposal was that we should adapt for production in thiscountry one of the new large American bombers, namely, the B. 29 or the B. 33,which are in an advanced stage of development in the United States.4.   The results of investigation of these proposals are given below.The switching of the Vickers organisation to the Lancaster.5. There is no doubt that this proposal is feasible, and if it were decided upon, the full co-operation of the Vickers organisation would be forthcoming.It is estimated that the first Lancaster might emerge about April 1944. i.e., sixmonths before the first B. 3/42. At first sight, therefore, this proposal has someattractions.&apos; Closer examination shows, however, that it would be inadvisable to adopt this proposal for the following reasons : (a) The advantages of six months gain, in time would be more than counter-balanced by the fact that we should be introducing an aircraft which- &quot;by then would be obsolescent, and which could not by improvement orre-design be given comparable operational efficiency with that of theB. 3/42.   (See paragraphs 6 and 7 below.)(b) Although we might all be satisfied if the entire heavy bomber industry were turning out Lancasters now, it would be a very doubtfulproposition to bring this about in 18 months&apos; or two years&apos;- time. Todo so would make us entirely dependent for progress on the success ofa Lancaster replacement which does not yet exist, even on paper. Weshould be in a much stronger position if at that time the B. 3/42 were about to come into production, as we should thus have two strings toour bow.(c) While the change-over from geodetic to stressed skin construction in theVickers organisation could no doubt be done, unforeseen delays wouldprobably result, and the introduction of the Lancaster might be later than suggested above.The introduction of a re-designed Lancaster comparable in performance tothe B. 3/42.6. If the Lancaster could be re-designed quickly, so that a new versioncomparable in performance to the B. 3/42 could be introduced over the whole range of Lancaster production, this would constitute a strong argument forswitching the Vickers organisation. Investigation shows that the best re-designwhich can be worked out will not give adequate performance for this purpose.The table given in the Appendix shows the latest comparison between are-designed Lancaster and the B. 3/42. The former falls short of the latter inthe following important respects : &apos;(a) The rate of climb with full load is much less.   This greatly affects themanoeuvrability, and thus the casualty rate.(&amp;) The armour is only proof against -303, whereas the B. 3/42 will havearmour proof against cannon,(c) The armament will not be so powerful.7. This comparison shows that a suitable replacement for the Lancastercannot be got on the basis of the re-designed Lancaster referred to in the annexedtable.*  It would be necessary to design an entirely new aircraft, probably with* Appendix.
six engines. The success, or otherwise, of this cannot yet be foretold, and,therefore, it would be very unwise to reject the B. 3/42, which holds out everyprospect of being a great advance on anything else in sight.^he adaptation of the B. 29 or the B. 33.8. Of these two types, the B. 29 is believed to have flown, but neither ofthem is yet clear for night work. The production of either of them in the UnitedKingdom would require a large quantity of special tools and floor space suchas few factories here possess. A great deal of work would be required to anglicizethe drawings and standards, and it is estimated that it would take one yearlonger to introduce either of them than it would to introduce the B. 3/42.Comparison of man-hours for the construction of the B. 3/42 and the Lancaster.9. In view of the labour stringency, an important factor in deciding thepolicy to be pursued in replacing the Wellington and the Warwick is the questionof the man-hours necessary to construct the replacement. The comparison betweenthe B. 3/42 and the Lancaster is as follows : B. 3/42 (estimated) ...      ......      40,000Lancaster     ...      ...      ...      ...      40,798   (It  is hoped to re-duce this eventually to 37,000.)These figures are for the airframes only, and that for the B. 3/42 must, ofcourse, be treated with reserve in this early stage of development. It does not,however, appear that there would be any material decrease in man-power requirements if the Lancaster were introduced instead of the B. 3/42, particularly as the proportion of unskilled labour employed in the geodetic type of construction is higher than in the stressed skin type.Switch of Austin and Short factories (except Short-Harland) from Stirling toLancaster.10. The proposal to switch this capacity has already been put forward tothe War Cabinet by the Minister of Production. Although it is not a matterdirectly related to the replacement of the Warwick and the Wellington, it hasbeen taken into account in this Report in view of its importance in the generalpicture of the heavy bomber programme. It is estimated that the change-overwould mean the loss of about 300 bombers between mid-1943 and the end of 1944.In our opinion, this change-over should be put in hand at the earliest possible moment, even if it causes a temporary diminution in our bomb-dropping capacityon Germany. The Minister of Production is going to try to cover the loss by securing a special allotment of American heavy bombers for the purpose. but whether this can be done or not, the superior results obtained from the Lancaster,and the burdensome labour requirements for the Stirling, make the changeeminently desirable, and it is hoped that it will be approved. The casualty rateof the Stirling combined with the large number of man-hours required for itsconstruction make it only about one-third as good a machine as the Lancaster.Switch of Halifax capacity to Lancasters.11. This is another change-over which is, on the face of it, attractive. Theloss would, however, be very considerable. The switch of all the Halifax firmswould probably take from mid-1943 to mid-1945, and the loss over the two yearsmight be as much as 1,000 bombers, with a possible further loss after the latterdate. In any case, the jig and tool capacity of the country would be insufficient to permit changing the Halifax firms to Lancaster at the same time as changing the Stirling. Efforts are being made to regain the loss in performance which has developed in the Halifax, and it is likely that a substantial improvement in thisrespect can be effected by redesign and modification.Requirements of Coastal Command and Bomber O.T.Us.    /12. There will be a continuing requirement for a long time to come ofWellingtons for these two purposes, amounting to about 90 a month. Whateverscheme is adopted, therefore, it would seem advisable to retain on Wellingtonsthe Vickers Blackpool factory, which has a peak output of 100 a month. Theposition can be reviewed during 1943.
Recommendations.13. The following recommendations are put forward for approval by theWar Cabinet: (a) That the proposal to introduce the new Vickers four-engine bombt(the B. 3/42) at the Weybridge and Chester factories should \^approved.   Every effort should be made to accelerate its introduction.(b) That the Vickers Blackpool factory should continue to manufactureWellingtons, the position being reviewed, say, in six months.(c) That steps should be taken to design a new aircraft (which wouldprobably have six engines) as a replacement for the Lancaster andother non-geodetic types.(d) That the improvement of the existing Lancaster should proceed in thenormal way.(e) That the change-over of Shorfs (except Short-Harland) and Austin&apos;sfactories from Stirling to Lancaster should be approved in principle,and should be carried out as soon as possible.(/) That the proposal to change over Halifax production to Lancaster should for the present be abandoned efforts being concentrated, on improving the performance of the Halifax.APPENDIX.All-up weight .Maximum cruising speed at 23,000 feet ...Economic cruising speed   ...Maximum bomb load        ...Range with maximum bomb load at most economical speed ...Range  with   8,000  lbs.   bomb   load   atmaximum cruising speedRate of climb at all-up weight at 23,000feet ...       ....Armour        ...       ...       ...       ...ArmamentRe-designed Lancaster.63,000 lbs.307 m.p.h.220 m.p.h.12,000 lbs.820 miles ,295 miles400 feet per minuteAgainst -303-in.2--303-in. m.gs. forward2--303-in. m.gs. top2 -303-in. m.gs. lower4 -303-in. m.gs. rearB. 3/42.60,000 lbs.325 m.p.h.230 m.p.h.8,000 lbs.1,700 miles.1,300 miles.740 feet per minute.Against 20-mm.2 -303-in. m.gs.forward.2 20-mm. guns aft.Plus 2 20-mm.
