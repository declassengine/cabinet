this document is the property OF his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1942.confidential. Copy-No. .W.P. (42) 551.November 26, 1942.vl &apos;WAR CABINET.REFORM OF THE FOREIGN SERVICE.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.I have only recently received the draft White Paper* on the reform of theForeign Service, and have had very little time in which to consider such animportant document, but I feel that before it is published and commits theGovernment to the views which it sets forth I should like my colleagues to know the uncertainty that I feel as to whether it is a sufficiently broad and compre-hensive study of the very important question with which it deals. If legislation is likely to result from it in the near future, I would suggest that it would be wise to give further consideration to the problem before anything is issued tothe public.The draft White Paper approaches the question of the Foreign Serviceentirely from the diplomatic and consular angle. I would suggest the possibilityof a different dichotomy. Why should the conception of Foreign Service exclude the existence of the Colonies, India and the Dominions ?The strongest impression I received during my short sojourn in the Far east was that too many Government Departments were attempting to deal with thesame problem, and that none of them was adequately qualified for the task. It .is at least worth consideration whether it would not be simpler to make a division between the Pacific world and the Atlantic world rather than to make a division between the British Empire and foreign countries. The Pacific is a larger andmore populous world than the Atlantic world and may possibly play a moreimportant part, in the future. If British control over the sub-continent of Indiadiminishes the importance of the posts which will remain to be filled there byBritish public servants will increase. Nor will it be so easy to recruit members for the Indian Civil Service. The qualifications for such posts in India and for those of British Ambassadors to China and Japan and British Governors ofthe Straits Settlements and Hong Kong approximate far more closely to one another than those demanded from, say, the British Ambassador to the UnitedStates and the British Minister to Siain just as the post of British ambassador to Egypt and that of Governor of the Straits Settlements, who is also HighCommissioner for the Malay States, are more similar to one another than to anyother Embassies or Governorships.I cannot see that in the new regulations suggested in the training fordiplomatists there is any assurance that we shall be more able in the future than we have been in the past to produce an ambassador who in late middle age isqualified, having spent the greater part of his career probably in the western hemisphere, to settle down among some six hundred million yellow people withany hope of holding his own. The British Diplomatic Service is founded on the traditions of the 18th and 19th Centuries, during which China and Japan playedno part in world affairs and during which India could be easily governed, withoccasional disturbances, by the East India Company with the help of the British* w.p.

Army. That has all changed. The change will be emphasised after the war, for japan has made a nation out of China as Napoleon made nations out of Germanyand Italy.If the Foreign Service has come under cricitism as a result of recent events,the Colonial Service has suffered equally, and it would seem on. the face of it asunwise to send as governors to places of such vital importance as Singapore and hong Kong men who have never been in Asia as it is to send equally unqualifieddiplomatists as ambassadors to. China and Japan, and there has been a realdivergence of policy as directed from the two different Departments in Whitehalltowards the two great oriental Powers, which is obviously to be deplored.The principle upon which High Commissioners to the Dominions are appointed also calls for enquiry. The tendency has recently developed to appointpoliticians to these offices. So far as Australia and New Zealand are concerned,both of which Dominions belong to the Pacific world, these posts could well be filled by members of an Eastern Foreign Service, if such were created.I understand that the reform of the Colonial Service is under consideration.I suggest that the futures of these two branches of foreign service the oneconcerned with foreign countries and the other with British colonies are closelyinterrelated and that their separation in the past has been deleterious to both.To consider the reform of one of them with no regard to the other would be toperpetuate the error of the past. I submit also that the future of India and ofthe Dominions should not be forgotten when any drastic reform of the overseasside of our Civil Service is undertaken.I think that before the White Paper is issued thorough consideration shouldbe given to the possibility of devising two Services, an Eastern and a Western,to cover two hemispheres, of which it is impossible to say at present which willbe the more important. To undertake the reform of the Diplomatic and ConsularService now in isolation from all other State Departments would seem as short-rsighted as to set about the rebuilding of one London street.D.
