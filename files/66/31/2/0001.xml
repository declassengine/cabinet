THIS DOCUMENT IS.&apos; THE PROPERTY OP HIS PR IT ANN IC MAJESTYSTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTvCOPY NO.3E G R E &apos;T.W.P.(k3)   5-iI2TH NOVEMBER^  19U2.Memojpanaum by the Secretary of State&apos;CEYLON&apos; RICE SUPPBIEiWAR cabinet o v the&apos; Co 1 ohie s1.   &apos; In a memorandum which I circulated&apos; to the War Cabinet(W.P.   (1.2) h08)  I. set out the . serious difficulties which - were -1 eingexperienced in-Ceylon on account of the. shortage of,rice supplies.On the lUth September the War Cabinet decided that. Sir RamasvramiMudaliar with the- Secretary of State for India and myself should consider what -further-measures could be taken to meet&apos; the- immediate. needs of the situation by obtaining special emergency shipments ofr,ice from India,  and the War Cabinet tool: note that the Secretaryof State for- India .and Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar would represent. &quot;tothe Viceroy the. importance of urging the-.Government to take stepsto ensure that the regular - monthly shipments of rice.to Ceylon -should be  increased as quickly as possible to. the level -requiredto meet the, is land&apos;&apos;s current needs - for cereals, -and &quot;to build upa reserve of -two months&apos;  supply.    .. &apos; : &apos;.-2.   .  Communications were accordingly..sent, to India and certain further Information obtained from Ceylon,  but I regret to say. thatthese do not indicate- that any satisfactory relief, of the s-ltua-tion is in prospect..    As.&quot;a result a grave situation is developing.On the-20th.October - rice stocks only amounted to-23,000 tons -   -about a fortnight&apos;-s &apos; supply.   - . &apos;  , .3.      Ceylon&apos;s essential minimum needs of rice for current, eonsump-&apos;tlon on a -rationed basis which will ensure &apos;sufficient for- the&quot;population,, &quot;including, those engaged in the &apos;vital rubber and tea   ... industries and in the operation of the ports and railways,  are30,000 tons&quot;a month.,   The only practicable source of supply is    -India. .: . ,-   - .        -        - -A.    : To make up for the shortage of cereals -which even this supply-involves-,  Ceylon needs an assured supply of wheat and flour from australia, at the rate of, 15? 000 tons a month.5. These quantities of cereals provide no margin for building&apos;up reserve stocks for which extra quantities of rice,-wheat and flour would; be. needed. -  - -  -6.      During the month of -October, . Ceylon has received from australia good - supplies of wheat and flour,, but only 1,2.50 tons     :of rice from India. -- &apos;7..     In any case,  other cereals such as wheat can only be sub-stittited to a -limited extent, because-the rice eating populationof.Ceylon will not- accept them in place of rice.    It. will be appreciated that the maintenance of the rubber and tea output of ceylon as well as the services of the port,  etc.,  depend on themaintenance of adequate supplies -of rice.-    The arrivals in the island&apos;of-food cargoes^- in recent.weeks have been so short, as&quot;todraw.&apos;from the&apos; Governor a warning that unless Ceylon received atleast -15,000 tons. of rice by- the end of October, a critical situ-.. *ation. was bound to arise. There are- already signs of,deterlora-tion&apos; in the output of essential.war materials from Ceylon.8.,     The production, of rice in India in 19U2 amounted to about,25,567,000 -tons and the forecast, of the; next crop, which.isShortly due to-be harvested,. &apos; Indicates an increase of about 2%&apos;.on that figure.    The - amount required-by - Ceylon &apos; is, therefore,less&apos; than of the &quot;total Indian crop. &quot;   &apos;,-   ;-&apos; ,    &apos;
I -must accordingly with still greater emphasis request. . (.1) .  that the Government of India should at once take-exceptional- measures.to ensure Geylon&apos;s&apos;essential rice-      supplies&apos;:     &apos; &quot;&quot;. &apos;    - - - &quot;- /(2)  - that wheat and flour shipments from-Australia to ceylon should be assuread on the scale I-have mentioned)(.3)    that if at- all possible extra&apos; quantities&apos; of both rice,. -     &apos;.   wheat and flour,  should be shipped to Ceylon for .tho&apos; purpose-  of forming a reserve stock- of essential food; and        .   ,&apos;        ;       (L)    that if there is any risk of 30,000 tons of rice, amonth not.being assured,  the shipments -of wheat   and&apos;flourfrom Australia should be increased proportionately ton /- - per ton.- . .But it must be -understood that any substitution of wheat or flour    /for the minimum&apos; needs of rice- would not entirely &quot;-serve, to maintain Ceylonoutput of war materials.Colonial Office,- C..   12TH NOVEMBER, - 19^2. .&apos;;        &apos;
