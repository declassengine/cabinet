THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET. , Copy No.ADMINISTRATION OF CROWN LANDS IN SCOTLAND.Memorandum by the Lord President oe the Council.THE Commissioners of Crown Lands-formerly the Commissioners of woods and Forests are the Body entrusted by statute with the administrationof the landed estates of the Crown which, at the beginning of each reign, are placed at the disposal of the Executive Government in return for the Civil List.The Board includes one Parliamentary Commissioner and one PermanentCommissioner. Prior to 1906, I understand that the First Commissioner ofWorks was the Parliamentary Commissioner. This combination of functionswas, however, held to be unsatisfactory, because of the possibility of conflict between the responsibilities of the two Offices, and in 1906 the President of theBoard of Agriculture was substituted for the First Commissioner of Works.This arrangement has continued to the present day.In 1906 the President of the Board of Agriculture had responsibilitiesextending throughout Great Britain. It was not until 1911 that a separateBoard of Agriculture was established for Scotland. It might have been suggested at that time that the creation of a separate Department, under the Secretary forScotland, called for a change in the arrangements for the administration of Crown Lands, but no question seems to have been raised until quite recently.With the acquisition, by purchase, of a large part of the Richmond andGordon Estates, the Commissioners came into possession, for the first time, ofconsiderable tracts of agricultural land in Scotland. This fact, taken inconjunction with the interest shown, very properly, by the present Minister ofAgriculture in the administration of the estate, has led to a demand for theconstitution of a separate Board of Commissioners of Crown Lands in Scotland.In my view, the anomaly of the present position has only to be brought to notice to make some change inevitable. Clearly, however, it would be wrong to concede the present demand for a separate administration in Scotland.Administration of Crown lands is a Trust, which should not be affected by political or party considerations. The arrangements for the administration ofthe property should be determined only by considerations of efficiency of management and the conservation of the capital value of the assets; that it shouldbe broken up in deference to national or local sentiment would be quiteindefensible.It is, in my view, quite . arguable that a Minister of Agriculture is not asuitable person to be entrusted with the duties of a Commissioner of crown lands, for the same reason which led to the displacement of the first commissioner of Works in 1906. The interests of a Government pursuing a progressive agricultural policy might not always march entirely in line with thoseof a landed proprietor. The ideal solution might, therefore, be to replace theMinister of Agriculture by some other Minister, whose Ministerial responsibilitiesdo not extend to the use of land in any form. Apart, however, from certainobvious practical difficulties which such a solution would present, I doubt if thepresent demand could be effectively staved off by the adoption of such a course.The demand is that Scotland should be associated with the administrationof Crown Lands, and the obvious alternative to separation is to add the Secretaryof State for Scotland, who is the Minister responsible for agriculture in Scotland,to the Board. I have ascertained that this course would be acceptable, both tothe Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State for Scotland, and I,therefore, recommend the early introduction of a short Bill for this purpose.If this course is approved, the Secretary of State should have an opportunityof preparing the ground with those who have been responsible for the presentagitation, before any public announcement is made. There is good hope that, inthis way, it will be possible to ensure the passage of the Bill as an agreedmeasure.J. A.Privy Council Office,November 3, 1942.[24650^
