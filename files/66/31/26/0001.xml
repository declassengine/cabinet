Armistice Government came into power, it is at least arguable that the Germaninterests would be as well served by standing on the Brenner as by undertaking the detailed defence of Italy against the wishes of its people, and possibly of a provisional Government.3. When a nation is thoroughly beaten in war it does all sorts of things which no one would imagine beforehand. The sudden, sullen, universal,simultaneous way in which Bulgaria Government, Army and people alike cut out in 1918 remains in my memory. Without caring to make any arrange-ments for their future or for their safety, the troops simply marched out of thelines and dispersed to their homes, and King Ferdinand fled. A Governmentheaded by a peasant leader remained to await the judgment of the victors.Similarly the French, at Bordeaux and after, committed acts which, bothin their folly and abjectness, were difficult to believe.4. Therefore I would not rule out the possibilities of a sudden peacedemand being made by Italy, and I agree with the United States policy of trying to separate the Italian people from their Government. The fall of Mussolini,even though precaution may have been taken against it beforehand, might well have a decisive effect upon Italian opinion. The Fascist chapter would be closed.One tale would be finished and another would begin. I consider it wouldbe well to drop leaflets over all Italian towns that are bombed, on the theme &apos;&apos; one man alone is the cause of your sufferings, Mussolini.&quot;5. It is to be observed that we are under no obligations to offer any terms to the vanquished, should they sue for them. That decision must be taken when and if we are offered their surrender, and in the meanwhile we certainly ought not to make promises, as some of the American propaganda leaflets have seemedto do.w. s. c.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1.November 25, 1942.
