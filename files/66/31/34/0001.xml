THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1942.SECRET.Copy. No.W.P. (42) 554.November 27, 1942.WAR CABINET.REFORM OF THE FOREIGN SERVICE.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I have read with interest the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Paper W.P. (42) 538 uponthe Reform of the Foreign Service. There are two or three points which occurto me.2. I appreciate the desirability of a special scheme of training for theForeign Service, but the memorandum seems to suggest that there is to be acomplete cleavage between the Foreign Service and the Home Service. To my mind one of the weaknesses of the Foreign Service has been its tendency to-regarditself as a special Service cut off from the Home Service. I should think thatthere must be in the Home Service many men now of middle age with markedadministrative ability who, but for their private circumstances, would have welcomed the opportunity of service under the Foreign Office. As it is nowproposed to make a fresh start on the Foreign Service, I would suggest that weshould not bar the way to transfers between that Service and the Home Service.There may, I suggest, be cases in which a man, who has some special experience in the Home Service, for example, on trade and economic questions, might with advantage be transferred to a post in the Foreign Service; per contra, there maybe cases in which a member of the Foreign Service might advantageously betransferred to the Home Service. Shall we not be wise in anticipating that inthe future there will be much more contact between nations, and accordingly thatin many spheres of Government work a knowledge of what is being done abroadwill be desirable? It seems to me that, notwithstanding the language difficulty,which in the Europe of to-morrow may well be not so serious an obstacle as it hasbeen in the past, there may be many advantages in giving members of the home service opportunities of acquiring experience for a time in foreign countries. i suggest, therefore, that we should not contemplate a system which will make suchtransfers more difficult.3. The Foreign Secretary&apos;s plan is a long-term plan which will not produceresults for some years to come. If new blood is needed in the Foreign Service now the best place to look for recruits is surely in the Home Service among men whohave already had considerable administrative experience. Could we not now with advantage consider likely candidates, particularly from those Departments ofState in which there may be redundancies after the war ?4. The Foreign Secretary proposes in paragraph 27 of the draft white paper that he should have power to require members of the Foreign Service whohave attained a certain rank to retire before the normal age of 60 &quot;&quot;with suitablecompensation.&quot; It is presumably contemplated that &quot; compensation &quot; will onlybe given if the initiative is taken by the Foreign Secretary, and will not be givento an officer who himself wants to retire for the sake of taking some lucrative-position in the business world. My colleagues will be aware of the danger thatambitious men who want large incomes might be tempted to use their official[24680]
positions for the sake of making contacts with the business world and gettingoffers of lucrative appointments. If. a system of early retirement on pension canbe operated in such a way as not to give any encouragement to this tendency, Ithink it may well be advantageous.5. But should it not be applied to the Home Service as well? There will,I suggest, be a demand when the Superannuation Bill is presented to -parliament for the application of its provisions to corresponding ranks in other branches ofthe Civil Service.H. M.Home Office, November 27, 1942.
