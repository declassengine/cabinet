THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPnnted for the War Cabinet.   November 1942.POSITION OF ITALY.Memorandum by the Secretary oe State for Foreign Affairs.THE Axis defeats in the desert and the operations in North Africa, the way in which the Italian troops have been left to their fate by the Germans in Egypt,and the British bombing attacks on the north Italian cities, have undoubtedly hada considerable effect on Italian morale, both civilian and military. Can we takeadvantage of the present confusion in the Italian camp and exploit it as part ofthe general strategy of the war ?2. I think we can, for the reasons given below rule out the possibility (a) ofbeing able to conclude a separate peace with Italy, and (b) of any automaticinternal collapse in Italy. There remains the possibility (c) of provoking an italian collapse.3. As regards (a) it is possible that moderate Fascists like Grandi might be willing to conclude a separate peace with the Allies. But it is scarcely conceivable that the bulk of the&apos;Fascist party, who know that peace terms with the allies would inevitably involve their disappearance from power, or that the Germans,who could not afford to let Italy leave the war, would allow Grandi or any othergroup of Italians to treat with the Allies. Nor can we build on the possibility ofthe House of Savoy taking a lead against the present regime and entering into negotiations with the Allies. Apart from the fact that the monarchy in generaland the Crown Prince in particular have sunk in the popular estimation, we havereliable information that the Crown Prince has already agreed with the germans to take over in the event of Mussolini&apos;s health breaking down.4 This brings us to (&amp;), since the conclusion of a separate peace in factpresupposes the overthrow of the Fascist regime. The Germans will certainlybolster up the Fascist regime to the uttermost. Even in the unlikely event of the regime being overthrown by the Army, the Germans would no doubt proceed to occupy Italy, thus effectually preventing the conclusion of any separate peace.Moreover, Mussolini and the Fascist party, whose very lives depend on maintain-ing control of the situation, should still be sufficiently powerful for many months.to come to be able to deal with incipient disorder and keep the creaky machineof government going even in the face of possible resistance.5. There remains (c) the possibility of provoking an internal collapsewhich, as indicated above, would force the Germans to take over the country.The limited objective of converting Italy into a definite liability to Germanymay be from the military point of view of even greater value than the biggerobjective of actually bringing Italy out of the war, since a neutralor even anItaly fighting on the Allied side could easily develop into a liability for the Allies,which might not be counterbalanced by the material and military benefits to be[24669]MOST SECRET Copy No.      l-ji similar......i i-ar- i ii ii     nW.P.

derived from such a situation. Up to the present Hitler has not had to expendmuch man-power on Italy; effective control of the country has been assured bythe co-operation of the Fascist party, the presence of members of the Gestapoand the facts that one of the German air fleets made its headquarters in Italy, andGerman Army formations have from time to time passed through the country.  ...6. In the event of an internal collapse, the Germans would have the choiceeither of abandoning Italy to her fate and making a frontier on the&apos; Brenner,or of sending troops to Italy to restore and possibly maintain the situation.Poll tically, the Germans could not afford to accept the former alternative unless it were physically impossible for them to spare the troops necessary for an occupation of Italy.7. Furthermore, an internal collapse in Italy proper, especially if it led toor was preceded by serious disaffection among the Italian armed forces, woiildprobably result in a mutiny in the Italian forces of occupation in Greece, Yugo-slavia and Albania. Thus the Germans would be forced to divert troops forthe occupation both of Italy and of the Balkans in order to take over the dutieshitherto performed by Italy in the Balkans. An occupation of Italy and the balkans would require thirty to forty German divisions.8. A German occupation of Italy would be intensely distasteful to the Italianpeople, would greatly increase unrest in the country and should predispose thepopulation in our favour and thus facilitate any military operations on our ownpart against Italy.9. I therefore recommend that, while discounting the chances of being ableto conclude a separate peace with Italy, we should concentrate on provoking an internal upheaval, with the object of committing Germany to the occupation ofItaly and the Balkans.10.   The weapons at our disposal are twofold :&apos;(1) Military warfare ((a) some military operation against Italy and (&amp;) air action).(2) Political warfare.11. As regards (1) (a), the capture of Sardinia, and still more of Sicily,would have a tremendous and possibly decisive effect. While it would not be safe to reckon with any certainty on the possibility of provoking a revolt againstthe Fascist regime among the Sicilians or the Sardinians, it is fair to point outthat Sicily, in particular, has never fully accepted the Fascist regime. If wewere, in occupation of either of these islands, and the population of the islandshad declared in favour of the Allies and against the Fascist regime, the positionof the central Fascist Government would be seriously affected&apos;. Moreover, it wouldbe brought home to the Italians of the mainland that we were on their doorstep,especially if we maintained a concentrated bombing campaign from Sicily orSardinia against the mainland.12. As regards (1) (b) (air action), in considering whether continuance of heavy bombing is likely to further or arrest disintegration in Italy, the followingmust be borne in mind. All our evidence shows that previous to the recent heavyraids on Genoa and Milan our bombing of the Italian cities on the whole had a salutary effect so far as the Italian population was concerned. Admiration was expressed for the chivalry of the R.A.F. in confining themselves to military objectives. But there have been reports that the indiscriminate bombing whichhas resulted in large civilian casualties in the recent heavy raids has arousedbitterness arid anti-British feeling. Similar bitterness may also have been aroused,among Italian troops out of Italy in view of the sufferings of their families. Onthe other hand, the demoralisation and panic produced by intensive heavy airbombardments no doubt outweigh any increase in anti-British feeling. on balance, therefore, there is everything to be said for keeping up and increasing our heavy indiscriminate raids on Italian cities.13. The question also arises whether we should now proceed to bomb Rome.It is probable that the maximum effect of bombing the seat of the Fascist Govern-ment, which has hitherto been left untouched, could be attained by reserving itas the climax in an intensive bombing campaign. I recommend, therefore, thatthe bombardment of Rome should, be left until a moment when we had reason tobelieve that Italian morale had reached almost breaking point.
14. As regards (2) (the political warfare weapon), I am strongly of theopinion that the best method of facilitating an internal upheaval in Italy is bystressing the hopelessness of Italy&apos;s position militarily, and the determination ofourselves and our Allies to pursue the war with the utmost vigour against Italy.fin my view there is nothing to be gained by any direct or indirect appeal to theItalian people or armed forces to overthrow the Fascist regime and abandon theGermans. Appeals of this kind would be scouted by the Italian people andexploited by the Fascist Government to our disadvantage as obvious propaganda.The United States Government, however, appear to be greatly attracted by theidea of making vague promises to Italy with the object of detaching her fromGermany, and it will be important to ensure identity of view on this question in Washington. In my view the method of assurances and promises can only bereally effective when it is a question of building up some dissident movement orleader who is ready to challenge the established Government and requires materialwith which to justify his own action and the sacrifices which the population arebeing called upon to make in overthrowing their Government. At present thereis no such leader or movement in Italy, hut if and when there is any sign of sucha development the question of making some declaration as to our future italian policy will, of course, have to be reconsidered.15. I therefore recommend the immediate adoption of a political warfarecampaign conducted on the following lines : The Italian people should be told constantly and with every weapon of open propaganda that Mussolini and the Fascist party have chosen to linkItaly&apos;s future with Nazism, that they have thus committed themselves to thesame fate as Hitler, and that we are determined to and assuredly shalldefeat and punish the Nazis and every one associated with them. we appreciate that the Italian people were forced into this struggle by the fascist regime. But if now the Italian people decide to continue along the fascist road, they will undoubtedly suffer all the woes and penalties which fall to the vanquished. If they do not, they themselves will know what theyhave to do. It was the Italian Government, and not His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, which took the step of breaking a friendship between the twopeoples which had never been broken before. This struggle was, therefore,none of bur seeking. But once the gauntlet has been thrown down it is ourhabit to continue until our opponent is beaten, and in this case our opponentis, and always will be, the Fascist Government and the Fascist regime inall its forms..
