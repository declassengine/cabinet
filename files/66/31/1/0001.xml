FRENCH NORTH AFRICA.1. Large-scale operations to occupy French North Africa commenced early on the 8th November under the supreme command of General Eisenhower, with admiral Sir Andrew B. Cunningham as Naval Commander.The main plan consisted of three assaults in force in the vicinity of Algiers,Oran and Casablanca.British naval forces operated inside the Mediterranean and U.S. naval forcesoff the Atlantic coast of Morocco. A covering force inside the Mediterraneanunder Vice-Admiral Sir E. N. Syfret consisted of three battleships, two aircraft-carriers, two cruisers and sixteen destroyers.The assaulting forces were divided into three task forces Eastern (Algiers),Centre (Oran), and Western (Casablanca). &quot; Only in the Eastern task force were any British troops included. The passage of transports and warships from theUnited Kingdom and the U.S.A. was carried out practically without detection bythe enemy, and only one assault ship was torpedoed inside the Mediterranean.Both strategic and tactical surprise was achieved in all three assaults.AIgiers Area.2. The naval force operating in this area under Rear-Admiral Burroughconsisted of four cruisers, two aircraft-carriers, three anti-aircraft ships, onemonitor, thirteen destroyers and ten sloops and corvettes.The assaulting force, consisting of three infantry brigade groups, one ofwhich was British, and two U.S. Commandos, carried out their initial landingssuccessfully against very little resistance. The direct assault on the harbourfailed, but the boom was breached by H.M. Destroyers Broke and Malcolm, bothof which were damaged. Broke subsequently sank on passage to Gibraltar.After the capture of the two airfields at Maison Blanc and Blida, 35 Spitfiresand 17 Hurricanes arrived from Gibraltar. A quick advance on the city ofAlgiers ended in its unconditional surrender at 1700/8th, and during the 9thnaval forces&quot; and shipping entered the harbour with full co-operation of theFrench port authorities.H.M. Destroyer Cowdray and H.M.S. Palomares (A/A ship) were damaged by enemy air attacks. Our fighters destroyed eleven enemy aircraft, probably destroyed two and damaged eight. Four enemy aircraft were shot down bv navalA.A. fire.Bougie.3. On the night of the 10th/11th an unopposed sea landing was made atBougie (east of Algiers) by an infantry brigade, which accompanied the assaultconvoy to Algiers, and which had been previously prevented from moving eastby bad weather. At dusk on the 11th, during heavy enemy air attacks,H.M.S. Roberts (Monitor) and the transports Cathay and Awatea were hit and set on fire. One enemy aircraft was shot down.In the course of these operations H.M. Aircraft-carrier A rgus was damaged in an air attack on the 10th and H.M. Sloop Ibis was torpedoed and sunk by aircraft: 103 survivors have been rescued.Oran Area.4. The naval force operating in this area under Commodore Troubridgeconsisted of three aircraft-carriers, three cruisers, one anti-aircraft ship,sixteen destroyers, ten sloops, corvettes and cutters and a number of trawlers.Although the three initial landings were successfully carried out, consider-able opposition was encountered when the assault forces had got ashore. Theseconsisted of one U.S. armoured brigade and three infantry brigade groups,together with one Ranger battalion.Naval opposition m the early stages necessitated H.M. ships sinking twoFrench destroyers and seriously damaging three others. H.M. Cutters Hartlandand V/alney broke the boom, entered the harbour and landed troops in anattempt to prevent the scuttling of ships. Both were eventually sunk.The coastal forts on the high ground to the west of the city and at Mers El Kebirmade any direct entry extremely hazardous so long as they remained active, andeven after two bombardments by H.M.S. Rodney and attacks by naval bombersthey remained in action. Tafaroui and La Senia airfields were occupied by U.S.troops and during the afternoon of the 8th 23 U.S. Spitfires arrived&apos; from
Gibraltar. One was shot down by a French fighter. During the 9th, U.S. infantryunits moved towards the city from the east and west, overcoming islands of resistance, while armoured forces protected the southern flank. Two Frenchattacks from the east and south were driven off. Three French aircraft were destroyed by U.S. fighters, three of which are missing (two pilots safe). On the10th, a concerted attack on Oran was carried out from all sides with support from u.S. fighters and naval forces. Resistance then crumbled and Oran was enteredsoon after mid-day.Thirty-nine U.S. troop-carriers with para-troops flew direct from theUnited Kingdom to North Africa. Thirty arrived at Sebkra (10 miles south-west of Oran) and the others have not been accounted for.Casablanca A tea.5. The U.S. naval force operating in this area under Admiral Hewitt(U.S.N.) consisted of three battleships, six cruisers, four aircraft-carriers and alarge number of destroyers.Three initial landings were made at Mehdia in the north, at Fedala (15 miles north of Casablanca) and at Safi, 140 miles further south. At each pointlandings had to be carried out in the face of stiff artillery fire while, at Fedala,French fighters machine-g unned U.S. troops on the beaches. After silencing thetoast defences, all three ports&apos;were in our hands and armoured forces were passed through. The total assaulting forces consisted of one U.S. armoured brigade and five infantry brigade groups. A French naval force consisting of one or two cruisers, destroyers and submarines were engaged by the U.S. covering force.One destroyer wras sunk and one cruiser damaged. The remainder of the forceretired into Casablanca, apparently damaged, covered by the five from the battleship Jean Bart Avhich was later sunk. The airfield at Port Lyautey wastaken and later 43 U.S. land fighters were flown there from a U.S. aircraft-carrier.Once on land resistance slackened. A hostile French column was driven off bythe Safi force which then advanced northwards, and French tanks retreated inthe face of U.S. armoured units moving south from Port Lyautey. An armouredcolumn after landing at Fedala reached the outskirts of Casablanca on the evening of the 10th and after an attack early on the 11th the town surrendered.U-boats.6. U-boat activity has been on a large scale throughout the latter stages ofthese operations and is continuing. On the 7th two very promising attacks weremade by Hudsons in the Western Mediterranean. H.M. Destroyer Achates sank a submarine, which was probably French, off Oran on the 8th. On the 9th H.M.Destroyer Westcott carried out a depth-charge attack on a U-boat and claims itsprobable destruction. On the same day U.S. transport Leedstown was torpedoed and beached west of Matifou (Algiers). The Ccisualties are believed to have beenlight, but 90 per cent, of: the cargo was lost. On the following day H.M.Destroyer Verity claims to have probably sunk a U-boat about 20 miles south of cape de Gata, and H.M. Destroyer Martin was torpedoed and sunk 85 miles north-east of Algiers. H.M. Trawler Lord Nuffield sank an Italian U-boat andpicked up 48 survivors. The s.s. Garlinge (2,012 tons) was torpedoed andksunk between Oran and Algiers. On the 11th the transport Viceroy of India(19,627 tons) was torpedoed and sunk 35 miles north of Oran while on passage to gibraltar; 425 survivors were picked up. On the same day the s.s. Nieuwfieeland (11,609 tons), which was returning independently from Algiers, was torpedoed 40 miles south-east of Gibraltar.Early on the 12th, H.M. Sloop Stork was torpedoed oft&quot; the Algerian coast,but was able to reach harbour, and there were no casualties. H.M. CorvetteStarwort sank a U-boat off Oran and picked up 45 survivors.On the night of 11th/12th H.M.S. Hecla (Destroyer Depot ship) was torpedoed and sunk 180 miles west of Gibraltar, and ELM. Destroyer Ma me,which was escorting her. was torpedoed some three hours later, but reached port.A U-boat attack was also made on a U.S. convoy on the Morocco Atlanticcoast in the evening of 11th, when the U.S. Joseph Hetves (7,177 tons) was sunk,and the U.S. Destroyer Hambledon and the Fleet auxiliary Winooski were damaged.Accidents.7. Two collisions are reported. H.M. Corvette Gardenia- was sunk on the9th in collision with H.M. Trawler Fluellen to the north-east of Habibas light and H.M. Minesweeper Cadmus was slightly damaged in collision with H.M.S:She field on the 11th.[24614] b
General Review.8. In the Western Mediterranean and oft&quot; the Atlantic coast of FrenchMorocco, powerful British and U.S. Naval forces have covered the landings in french North Africa. U-boats have concentrated in this area, where our aircraft and anti-submarine patrols have carried out a number of successful attacks.Three promising attacks were also made in the Biscay area and North Atlantic.An Italian cruiser has been torpedoed, but was able to reach Palermo.A raider has been sunk in the Indian Ocean.Shipping losses, apart from casualties in the Western Mediterranean, havebeen moderate.Home Waters.9. Several E-boats are reported to have been damaged during an attackon a coastal convoy off Lowestoft on the night of the 9th/10th. On the samenight two of our M.T.Bs. encountered an enemy convoy of eight ships escorted by minesweepers off the Dutch coast. A tanker of 5,000 tons was torpedoed andtwo other ships were possibly damaged. No damage or casualties were sustained by the M.T.Bs.Northern Waters.10. Of the ships proceeding independently to North Russia, four havereached their destination, two are believed sunk, and three ships have returnedto Iceland (C). One Russian ship, reported attacked by aircraft on the 7th, is proceeding and two ships are overdue.On the 3rd enemy aircraft sank a ship, some tugs and a barge on lake ladoga.Mediterranean.11. On the 8th H.M. Submarine P. .46 torpedoed an Italian cruiser off thenorth-west coast of Sicily. On the following day a &quot; Regolo &quot; class cruiser was seen in Palermo with her bows damaged.On the 10th H.M. Submarine Utmost sighted an enemy force of three cruisers and three destroyers to the east of Sicily and claimed two hits on them. this force had previously been attacked by naval aircraft as described in the air situation. The three cruisers were subsequently reported to have reached PortAugusta.12. On the 9th H.M. Minesweeper Cromer was mined and sunk off mersa matruh.Naval aircraft in Egypt have continued to co-operate with R.A.F. bombersin their successful night attacks on enemy transport and supply columns with-- :   . ing along the coast-road to Libya.13. During the early part of the week 20,306 tons of French merchantshipping westbound, and 19,593 tons eastbound, passed Gibraltar under escort.Indian Ocean.14. On the 11th H.M.I.S. Bengal (minesweeper), on passage from Fve-mantie to Colombo in company with the Dutch Tanker Ondina, was shelled by araider 1,500 miles north-west of Fremantle. Bengal engaged the raider whichcaught fire and is believed to have sunk. The raider&apos;s supply ship escaped.Ondina is presumed to have sunk.Pacific.15. A belated report has been received that a Dutch submarine on patroloff Penang on the 25th October, sighted a Japanese convoy of four ships and claims to have torpedoed one of them.AntUSubmarine Operations.16. In addition to the attacks on U-boats carried out in the western mediterranean, three promising attacks have been reported from the atlantic and Biscay areas.
On the 5th a Catalina attacked a U-boat north of Iceland (C). Wreckageand some of the crew were seen in the water after the attack. A Liberator madea promising attack in mid-Atlantic on the same day.On the 10th debris was seen after an attack by a Liberator in the northernBiscay area.The six survivors, reported to be from a German U-boat, who landed atNemours (Algeria) on the 6th, cannot, at present, be connected with any knownanti -submarine oper at i ons.Enemy Intelligence.German.17. It is reported that the Admiral Scheer with four destroyers has passedsouth through the Sound and is now in the Baltic. The German raider Neumarkwhich was attacked in Havre by our aircraft, has proceeded up Channel andmay have passed through the Straits of Dover.Italian.18. There has been appreciable increase in the traffic from Italy to Libyaduring the week.Japanese.19. The Japanese are still superior in carrier-borne aircraft and the resultof a recent operation has been to increase this superiority. The Allied superiority in shore-based aircraft, however, remains very large and the rate of Japanesewastage is increasing it. An important factor in the air situation is that theU.S. airfield in the New Hebrides can be used by fully loaded Fortresses.U-boats.20. There are probably over 30 German and Italian U-boats operating inthe Western Mediterranean and a large concentration is also operating to thewest of Gibraltar. There has been considerable activity in the Trinidad area and it is estimated that six German U-boats are operating between Capetownand the Mozambique Channel.The Italian submarine Reginaldo Giuliani which has entered Santanderin a damaged condition on the 3rd September and had attempted, unsuccessfully,to escape on the 5th, was given until the 17th November to effect repairs. Sheleft Santander on the 8th and is reported to have been met by air an*d surfaceescorts.Protection of Seaborne Trade.21. During the week ending 3th/9th, 787 ships have been convoyed. Ofthese, 143 were in ocean convoys and 644 in British coastal convoys. Fifty-two destroyers (including two United States destroyers) and 57 cutters and corvettes(including one United States cutter) have been employed on escort duties.During the week, 113 ships in five ocean convoys arrived in home waters.Twelve ships were sunk.22. During the month of October, 14 homeward-bound ocean convoys of341 ships arrived in the United Kingdom without loss, and four oonvoys. originallyof 144 ships, lost 10 ships (two of which were stragglers) before arrival. In thesame period 13 outward-bound ocean convoys of 375 ships arrived at their destinations without loss, and two convoys, originally of 72 ships, lost three beforearrival, all of which were stragglers when sunk. In addition to the above losses,17 ships have been sunk during October in convoys still at sea at the end of themonth. In Western Atlantic and the Caribbean, 165 convoys of 1,829 ships wereescorted to their destinations during October without loss, and two convoys only,comprising 15 ships, lost one ship each.The number of convoys (including coastal convoys) run in October was 345as compared with 365 in September.23. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 7th November totalled 785,000 tons compared with an average of649,000 tons for the past ten weeks. Of the week&apos;s imports, 364,000 tons weremineral oil of various grades.[24614] - B 2
Enemy Attack on Shipping.24. Apart from those ships attacked in the operations off the North african coast, 18 ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boats, of which seven are known to be sunk. Eight ships, five of which were in United States convoys, were torpedoed in the Caribbean. Three ships were attacked off the north-east coast of Brazil, three in the Gulf of Guinea, three east of Capetown and one south-east of Newfoundland.Two ships in coastal convoy were torpedoed by E-boats off Lowestoft, andone ship independently routed from Russia to the United Kingdom was attacked by aircraft north-east of Bear Island.25. Shipping losses from enemy action during October, as recorded to date,total 554,000 tons; of this total rather more than 541,000 tons, or about 97 percent., was due to U-boats. Among the ships lost were seven of tonnages rangingbetween 12,000 and 20,000 tons.The bulk of the losses occurred on the trade routes of the North and south atlantic, considerably increased U-boat activity being apparent to the North ofAscension and in the vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope. U-boats also concen-trated on attacking convoys to the south of Iceland (C), and in the Azores area.Three ships were also sunk by U-boats in the Indian Ocean and two in the Pacific.Among the ships sunk were 13 tankers totalling 118,000 gross tons.British Minelaying.26.   During the week light craft laid mines off the French and Dutch coasts.Aircraft laid mines off the Frisian Islands, in the Bay of Biscay and in theBaltic.Enemy Minelaying.   British Minesweeping.27. Mines may have been laid by E-boats off Lowestoft on one night of theweek. No aircraft minelaying has been reported. Fourteen moored mines havebeen destroyed in Lyme Bay and six magnetic mines have been destroyed; four inthe Thames Estuary and one each off the Humber and Portsmouth.The mine totals now are : acoustic 1,329, magnetic 2,724, moored 1,829.Enemy Merchant Shipping.28. During the past week a tanker of some 7,000 tons has moved from Havreto St. Nazaire, and a merchantman of about 3,000 tons is believed to have passedup the Channel. There has been a trend of barges eastward through the straits of Dover to the Ostend area.Three German blockade runners are reported to have arrived in Biscay portsrecently, and four ships are believed to have sailed for Japan.29. At Fiume five ships of about 5,000 tons are reported to be under construction, while four small ships of about 250 tons are fitting out; at Venicethree ships of about 2,000 tons are now building, and ships under construction atTrieste include four merchantmen totalling 45,000 tons, and five tankersamounting to 38,000 tons.Russian Intelligence.30. A Russian submarine claims to have sunk a merchant ship off the mouth of the Danube on the 4th, but no details are available. On the 5th a GermanE-boat unsuccessfully attacked Tuapse.vichy French Intelligence.31. The Vichy French Fleet at Toulon was seen on the 7th to consist ofStrasbourg, Dunkerque, Provence, Condorcet, Commandant Teste, four 8-inch cruisers, three 6-inch cruisers, seventeen corvettes, twelve destroyers, five torpedo boats and escort vessels and ten submarines. Since that date the battleshipProvence has left dry dock, and the battle-cruiser Strasbourg has entered thedry dock.At Bizerta on the 7th seven destroyers -were present. It is reported that the entrance to the harbour at Bizerta has been blocked.
Egypt.32. Summarising the fighting reported in last week&apos;s Resume in the lightof later information, it is apparent that our final attack on the Alamein position on the night of the 1st/2nd November achieved a break-through and was com-pletely successful in opening a corridor through the remaining enemy defences.Our armour subsequently passed through the gap and throughout the following day was engaged in a fierce tank battle, in which both sides suffered considerablecasualties.After withstanding the brunt of our attack in the Northern sector, the two German armoured divisions and the Italian Littorio Division had lost the bulk oftheir tanks. The 164th German Light Division was reduced to 25 per cent, of its strength and the Italian Trento Division was practically wiped out. The German90th Light Division may have been three parts intact.Our advance at this stage was slow, being hindered by mines and anti-tankgun screens. One of our armoured car regiments, however, managed to get com-pletely through the enemy lines and operated alone in the enemy&apos;s rear areas for nearly two days, destroying M.T. and interfering with enemy communications.The battle continued unabated throughout the 3rd, and the first definite signsof an enemy withdrawal became apparent on that day. A record number ofR.A.F. sorties added to the confusion of the enemy forces by attacks launchedfirst against his concentrations in the battle area and later against his congestedM.T. on the coastal road.During the night of the 3rd/4th, the small enemy pocket in the coastal sectorwas cleared by Imperial troops. After some further fighting on the Southernflank of the corridor, our advancing armoured formations were able to follow upthe retreating enemy.Our break-through was now complete, and by the evening of the 4th some ofour armoured formations were engaged with the remnants of the German andItalian armour, together with the German 90th Light Division. These had withdrawn to a position in the area of Fuka, leaving Italian infantry divisions,which were holding the Southern front, to fend for themselves.33. The German and Italian remnants, having held the Fuka position for24 hours, withdrew to Matruh, and on the 7th their rear guards were stubbornlyresisting near Matruh railway station. Their resistance -was overcome, andMatruh was occupied the following morning (the 8th). The landing stages were found to be intact and the road was reported to be clear of mines. Our leadingelements in the coastal sector continued their advance, and drove the enemyfrom Sidi Barrani. On the 10th enemy resistance near Buq Buq delayed ouradvance till the evening in the coastal area, but further inland our armoured forces crossed the frontier, and our armoured cars were operating near Gambut.By the 11th some of our armoured units reached Capuzzo. Halfaya Pass was found clear of the enemy, but the Sollum Pass was blocked by a large crater. Aconsiderable number of prisoners were taken in the frontier area. South-west of Gambut our light mobile forces found El Gubbi clear of the enemy, butmined.Increased enemy movement to the north of the landing ground at Sidi Rezeghwas reported, and air reports showed large concentrations of enemy M.T. movingalong the roads Bardia-Tobruk and Tobruk-El Gazala-Tmimi.The clearing up of the battle area and the coastal sector is proceeding.34. In the course of the last fortnight&apos;s fighting it is estimated that nearly500 enemy tanks have been destroyed, and that enemy casualties total over 59,000(including killed, wounded and prisoners of war). Some 25,000 prisoners of war have already reached Alexandria. Of the six Italian motor and infantry divisions, the H.Q.s of four have been captured.The Russo-German Campaign.Northern, Central and Don Sectors.35. South-east of Lake Umen and on the River Don there has been localfighting but no important territorial change. -Stalingrad Sector.36. The position at Stalingrad seems likely to become one of stalemate. Inhis speech of the 8th November, Hitler stated that, as the Volga traffic was
interrupted, the remaining strong points of the city were not worth a secondVerdun. For the past week, indeed, the Germans appear to have confinedthemselves mainly to mopping-up activities: while the Russians, who have beencounter-attacking resolutely, report signs of German exhaustion.Caucasus Sector.37. From Alagir, the capture of which is confirmed, the Germans have beenpushing eastwards towards Ordjonikidze, but have been meeting with strongRussian resistance. It seems possible that an attempted move on Grozni fromtihe south-west may be intended. In the Western Caucasus the Germans havemade little further progress towards Tuapse.Summary.3S. With the abatement of the German attacks on Stalingrad. german offensive activities are confined to the areas of Ordjonikidze and Tuapse. Thereare also indications that the projected German attack on Leningrad has been abandoned. It remains to be seen whether the Russians can now take advantageof this passivity and repeat their tactical offensives of the winter of 1941-12.Madagascar.39. On the 5th, while our advance southwards was in progress, a Frenchemissary arrived at our forward brigade HQ. and asked for an armistice.Hostilities ceased at 1400 hours and an armistice was signed at midnight(5th /6th November).India and Burma.40. In the Hukawng Valley area (Northern Burma) hostile Burmans,probably under Japanese command, have occupied Shingbwiyang, about 60 milesfrom the frontier.In the Akyab coastal area the Japanese have reinforced their forward troopsby one Battalion, bringing their strength in this area up to approximately 3,000.Our forward troops have now been brought up to Brigade strength and arepatrolling south of the Bengal frontier.While some regrouping of Japanese forces along the frontier may be takingplace, there are no indications that any major offensive against India ^scontemplated.Pacific Zone.South-Went Pacific Area.41. In the New/ Guinea area, the Australian forces advancing along -themain Kokoda-Buna track who were held up at Oivi (6 miles east of Kokoda),have now succeeded in forcing the enemy from his main positions with heavy losses; his retreat has been blocked by our enveloping troops astride the maintrack and he is endeavouring to cut his way through. Simultaneously anotherAustralian column, moving south of the track, has enveloped and destroyedJapanese forces trapped south of Gorari (12 miles east of Kokoda). In additionadvanced elements of a U.S. regiment advancing down the Kumusi River are in contact with the Japanese three miles south of the Wairopi Bridge.South Pacific Area.42. The U.S. forces on Guadalcanal Island are continuing their counter-attacks against the Japanese and have improved their positions both to the Eastand Westward. Enemy reinforcements of men and material arrive at Rabaulalmost daily. From Rabaul these reinforcements are transported down to theBuin-Faisi-Tonolei area and thence to Guadalcanal. The present Japanesestrength on Guadalcanal is reported to be the equivalent of two divisions,totalling 25-30,000 troops. It is announced that the Japanese have lost at least5,000 killed since the fighting in the S.E. Solomons started on the 7tlh August.This figure is based on an actual count of bodies, and does not take into accountJapanese killed in areas still under enemy control.
General Review.43.   Two successful attacks were made on Genoa.Enemy M.T. during the retreat to Libya was very heavily attacked.German aircraft in Tunis suffered heavy casualties.United Kingdom.44. Fighter Command flew 942 defensive sorties by day, including 25 by .S. aircraft, and 226 by night.Enemy activity against this country was on a negligible scale. At night no enemy aircraft flew overland. By day five enemy aircraft were shot down by our fighters.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.45. Fighter, Bomber and Army Co-operation Commands despatched993, 101 and two offensive sorties respectively, compared with 280, 65 and sixlast week. In addition, 93 U.S. fighter sorties and 174 U.S. bomber sorties were flown on offensive operations.The dock installations at St. Nazaire were successfully attacked by29 Fortresses, which bombed from heights between 7,500 and 10,000 feet. A totalof 65 tons of H.E. bombs was released; several hits were seen on the objective and on both sides of the locks and a ship was damaged. An hour later,11 Liberators dropped 32 tons of bombs on the same target, upon which at least six more hits were observed. (Vide Appendix VII.) No enemy aircraft was encountered, but three Fortresses were brought down over the target by flak,which was intense and accurate.Fortresses and Liberators attacked the docks and U-boat pens at Brest;visibility was poor and results were not seen. Thirty Fortresses made a high-level raid on the Fives-Lille steel and engineering works at Lille; bombs fellon factory property in the target area. Eleven Fortresses, in heavy cloud,attacked Abbeville/Drucat airfield; results were mainly unobserved. The U.S.air-gunners claim the following successes against intercepting enemy aircraft :15 destroyed, 21 probably destroyed and 25 damaged. About 40 squadrons of fighters, including three of U.S. Spitfires, provided escort and diversionarysweeps during these three operations. Two enemy aircraft are claimed to havebeen damaged by R.A.F. fighters, eight of which did not return. One Fortressis missing.Bostons, with fighter escort, attacked the airfield at Caen/Carpiquet; thecentral runway and the dispersal area were hit. (Vide Appendix VII.) two attacks by escorted Bostons were made on Havre, in the second of which bursts were seen on dock installations. Unescorted Bostons using cloud coversuccessfully bombed a factory in the Courtrai region and obtained hits on thecentre of a goods train near Bruges, the latter attack being carried out from50 feet. A low-level attack by Spitfires on Bergen-op-Zoom resulted in thedestruction of the gas works. Sorties were. carried out by Spitfires againstrailway, canal and military targets in the Cherbourg-Bruges area; manyhits were made on locomotives, one of which was seen to blow up. Railwayembankments between Havre and Dieppe and another near Valognes (Cherbourg-peninsula) were effectively bombed by Whirlwinds. Heavy and medium bombers,including Venturas, attacked targets in or near Wilhelmshaven, Osnabruck,Duisburg, Gelden and elsewhere in enemy territory and at Rotterdam andMaasluis. From these operations our losses were four Venturas, three Bostonsand one Mosquito.During fighter sweeps, in which U.S. aircraft participated, three enemy aircraft were destroyed, three probably destroyed and three damaged. Our losses were two Spitfires (one pilot safe).The Photographic Reconnaissance Unit made 65 sorties and a further25 photographic sorties were flown by aircraft of Army Co-operation Command.Two aircraft are missing.Night.46. Bomber Command operated against targets in Germany on one night;213 aircraft were despatched.  Over 400 tons of bombs were dropped on industrial
areas in the North-West, including Hamburg, and in the Ruhr. weather conditions deteriorated on the outward journey and visual observation of resultswas rendered impossible by low, heavy cloud. Fifteen bombers did not returnand one crashed.Sixteen Intruder sorties were flown; one of these aircraft was lost.Propaganda leaflets were distributed over a wide area of France, 48 sorties beingflown for this purpose. Other operations by Bomber Command are given in thenext paragraph and under &quot; Coastal Operations.&quot;Italy.47. On two consecutive nights our home-based bombers raided the industrialcentre and docks at Genoa. The first attack was carried out by 63 Lancastersand the second by 138 aircraft, including Lancasters. Halifaxes, Stirlings andWellingtons. Weather over the target was. on both occasions, excellent and,aided by flares accuratelv placed by Pathfinders, the target was identified easilv.Totals of 179 tons of H.E. bombs, including 34 x 4.000 lbs., and 190 tons ofincendiaries were dropped. Both attacks were successful, particularly the second,when photographs confirm that an area in the centre of the city, covering a radius of a mile, was early ablaze; eighteen exceptionally big fires were counted andmany smaller ones were developing. Part of the dock area was seen to be on fire and two large explosions were observed in the inner harbour. Late arrivals,finding the primary target was burning so fiercely; attacked the Ansaldo works and started considerable fires there (ride Appendix VII). From these two attackswhich involved 247 sorties, seven of our bombers are missing and six crashed(two complete crews and four members of another are safe).Coastal Operations.48. Coastal Command despatched 590 sorties, of which 198 were on anti-U-boat operations and 35 on convoy escorts. Bomber Command despatched60 sorties on patrols in the Bay of Biscay zone. Results of anti-U-boat operations are summarised under &quot;Naval Situation.&quot; Aircraft operating under fighter command flew 427 sorties, including two by U.S. aircraft on shipping-protectionpatrols.Anti-shipping operations off the French, Belgian and Dutch coasts by R.A.F.and U.S. Spitfires involved 77 and 36 sorties respectively.A convoy in the Gironde river was attacked by Mosquitos; a ship was-hit(vide Appendix VII). Later, and also on the following night, heavy bombers attacked the same target; several near misses are reported but detailed results were not seen owing to evasive action necessitated by heavy Flak. A convoy offIjmuiden was also subjected to attacks with inconclusive results.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week : Italy.Milan.Photographs taken on the 8th November show damage mainly by firescattered across the whole town. Buildings affected are mostly industrial andmany factory sheds have been destroyed or damaged, among others, those of theG.E.C. (Electrical Engineering), the Municipal Tramways, Carminati and Toselli(Transport Vehicles), S. A. Siry Chamon (Gasmeters), Gonorand Freres (Ware-houses and Garages), Officine Caproni (Aircraft Works).In the Stazione Genova the whole of the main building has been severely damaged by fire and blast, and two or three smaller buildings have been gutted.The railway track shows signs of blast or debris, and there is damage to two smallwarehouses nearby.Ground sources report that one heavy bomb in Via Maine demolished by direct hit one house and by air blast the adjacent large houses. -The majority ofglass windows were broken within an area of about 150 metres from the pointof impact of H.E. bombs. In squares or similar open places, breakages occurredup to about 400 metres.Genoa.-A preliminary interpretation of photographs (which are not ideal for damageassessment) shows that (i) Iji the attack on the 6th/7th November damage was caused almost entirely to property in the eastern part of the town, and(ii) In the attack on the 7th/8th November further severe damage was caused to the Tirreno fitting-out yards and to business property in the centre of the town.Occupied France.Le Creusot.Photographs taken on the 9th November cover further parts of the works,and it is seen that the rolling mills and iron bar stores are severely damaged. Theheavy forging department and armour plate bending shop have suffered roofdamage. Other reports tell of the severe damage and destruction caused, and itwould seem that the only part of the works to have escaped undamaged were thecoppersmith&apos;s and blacksmith&apos;s shops. The importance of this works to theGermans is demonstrated by the rapid progress that is now being made in roofrepairs to many of the damaged buildings, and on the day following the attacktwo flak trains were brought into the neighbourhood.Caen.Photographs taken during the attack on the aerodrome on the 6th Novembershow at least 30 bursts on the Western dispersal area. On the east side of the aerodrome five bursts are seen among the barrack buildings and eight in theimmediate vicinity.St: Nazaire.Photographs show that during an attack by U.S. Fortresses on the st. Nazaire dock area on the 9th November : (i) Two quayside warehouses, each about 250 ft. long, received direct hitsand are partly demolished,(ii) A three bay building, 270 x 120 ft., received a direct hit, severelydamaging it.
(iii) The main building of the Locomotive Depot was almost completelydemolished while a subsidiary building- was seriously damaged.(iv) The Mould Loft and Plate Shop of Chantier et Ateliers de Penhouetsuffered severe damage over an area more than 240 ft. square,(v) The Hydraulic Machine Shops suffered damage to three central bays ofa six bay building while a long shed adjacent thereto was destroyed for nearly half its length.(vi) A 120 ft. M/V suffered a direct hit and now lies half submergedalongside the quay.(vii) The Highways Office of the Civil Engineering Department receivedblast damage to its roof while an adjacent building has been partially destroyed and others damaged.(viii) There were several hits on the railway lines damaging rails and over-turning several wagons.Germany.Cologne.In the attack on the 15th/16th October damage was caused to railway lines and cranes in the Rhine harbour and to the I.G. Farben chemical works atLever kusen.Krefeld.. It is further reported that in the attack on the 2nd/3rd October, 500 houses were destroyed or damaged and two dye factories hit.Sea-mining.It is reported that the Dutch Batavier III (2,687 tons), recently employed as a transport between Norway and Germany, was mined and sunk 10 miles south-east of Oestre Flak, in the Kattegat, about the middle of October.According to the Swedish radio the Danish tug Juno was mined and sunk off Elsinore (W. Entrance to the Sound) on the 3rd November.. It is also reported that a ship, probably the Finnish Helene (295 tons),,was mined of N. Germany in August.On the 3rd November a tug was damaged by a mine off Helsingor.The dredger Bayonne II was sunk and at least one minesweeper with Germancrew sunk or seriously damaged off Bayonne on the 19th September.Shiramng.Photographs taken during the attack on shipping in the mouth of the RiverGironde by five Mosquito aircraft on the 7th November, 1942, show that aSperrbrecher received a direct hit aft of the funnel.Labour Recruitment.German labour recruitment offices in France have issued a special appeaLoutside the general recruitment scheme, for all classes of house-builders to go to^Germany. There is a particular demand for bricklayers and tilers, of whom there is an acute shortage in Germany at the present time, owing to the need of labour for repair and air-raid damage. Glaziers are in equal demand.Private citizens are themselves urged to clear away as much of the mess as possible from damaged buildings capable of repairs, so that when the skilled men arrivethey do not have to waste time in removing debris.
