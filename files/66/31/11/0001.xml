Air reconnaissance during the early part of the month had revealed a heavy concentration of enemy, transports and warships in the New Britain/N.W. Solomons area. An attempt to recapture Allied positions in theGuadalcanal/Tulagi area was indicated, and on the 10th it became evident thatan expedition was being launched in force.Enemy naval forces approached the S.E. Solomons from the north. Thespearhead of the attack was a force composed of two battleships of the &apos;&apos; kong &apos;&apos;class and a number of other ships, believed to have been two heavy cruisers, fourlight cruisers and about ten destroyers. These reached the Guadalcanal areashortly after midnight on the night 12th/13th, intending to bombard Allied shorepositions, prior to a large-scale landing from a group of transports which hadbeen observed in the Buin/Shortland area.The naval force was formed in three groups and, as they approached theywere engaged by ships of the U.S. Fleet at close range. During this nightengagement, the enemy seemed confused and, in the later part of the battle, twoof the three groups were firing at each other. Shortly afterwards the enemywithdrew from the battle and retired northwards. On the 13th, U.S. aircraftmade continuous attacks on damaged ships which remained in the area.During the morning of the 14th, a large formation of at least 12 enemytransports, heavily escorted, approached Guadalcanal, where they were heavily attacked from the air.  At least eight transports were sunk.During the night of 14th/ 15th, U.S. naval forces again engaged enemy units,but details have not yet been received.On the morning of the 15th, four enemy transports were found beached atTassafaronga (on Guadalcanal).

Two survivors were picked upby a Walrus. In addition six other U-boats were probably sunk and four damaged in the Western Mediterranean and to the west of Gibraltar.In areas east and west of Gibraltar during the operations off the north african coast up to the 17th, it is estimated that four U-boats have been sunk,nine probably sunk, five seriously damaged and seven damaged.In the West Atlantic, H.M.

French North Africa.28. On the morning of the 10th, a long interview was held at Algiersbetween General Clark, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, United States Forces,and Admiral Darlan, the outcome of which was an Order by the latter to all land,air and naval forces in North Africa, including Morocco and Tunisia, to discontinue hostilities immediately. Shortly afterwards, however, marshal petain broadcast instructions countermanding Admiral Darlan&apos;s Order and considerable confusion amongst French Commanders ensued. Negotiations tookplace which culminated in a further meeting at Algiers on the 13th, which was attended by General Eisenhower and Admiral Cunningham, in an attempt toreach a final settlement. As a result of this meeting, the French Commandershave now agreed to co-operate with the Allied Forces and have promised to assist us in so far as they can in opposing the Axis in Tunisia.Admiral Darlan has appointed General Giraud to be his military commander and the latter has undertaken the reorganisation of selected militaryforces. Following his visit to French forces in &quot;Tunisia, there are now definitesigns of French resistance to the Germans.French Morocco.29. The U.S. forces are now in occupation of San, Fedala, Mazagan,Port Lyautey and Casablanca; armoured units from Mazagan have moved up toRabat. The defence of ports and airfields has been ordered and patrols are operating towards the principal towns.   The population remains friendly.The capacity of the principal port, Casablanca, has been greatly reduced bythe sinking of at least nine ships in the harbour one of them the battleshipJean Bart. There are, however, eight working berths in the harbour and oversidedischarging is also taking place.A Igeria-Tunisia.30. On the 12th a Commando made an unopposed landing at Bone, coupled with a successful landing at the same time by units of a parachute battalion.Later in the same day, infantry units occupied Djidjelli. On the 13th, reinforce-ments arrived at Bone and a detachment occupied Setif.On the 16th, British parachute troops, carried in U.S. transport planesfrom Algiers, made a successful drop at Souk El Arba and are now operating from Beja, 30 miles to the north-east, in the direction of Mateur and MedjesEl Bab.The advance eastwards continues, and patrols ordered to reconnoitre forwardalong the road to Mateur have now made contact with the Germans some 20 miles west of that town. Germans have also been encountered by the French some20 miles north-east of Beja and at Oued Zarga.31. U.S. parachute troops were dropped at Youks Les Bains and occupiedthe airfield without incident on the 16th. On the 18th a detachment of these troops was landed at Gafsa airfield, some 80 miles to the south-east, as a precautionary measure and in order to guard a considerable quantity of petrolstored there.U.S. infantry units are on their way to relieve British garrisons at Bougieand Djidjelli, and other U.S. units, including some armour, arrived at Algierson the 18th.The Russo-German Campaign.Northern, Central and Don Sectors.32. There has been little activity, apart from local engagements, on theRiver Volkhov front and in the Kletskaya area. The Germans appear apprehen-sive of Russian intentions in the Central Sector.Stalingrad Sector.33. The position at Stalingrad is substantially unchanged, though theGermans, in renewed attacks, may have gained a little further ground in theNorthern part of the city.Caucasus Sector.34. German forces, which have been advancing towards Ordjonikidze fromthe West, have been thrown on the defensive by strong Russian counter-attacks.In the Tuapse area also the German advance has been checked.
Summary.35. After a mild autumn there has been a sudden drop in the temperatureon the front from Leningrad to Stalingrad. This will temporarily assistoperations so far as movement is concerned, but.denotes that winter has now set in and entails the abandonment of any further large-scale offensives this year.Pacific Zone.South-West Pacific.36. On the 10th the Australian forces overcame the enemy resistance atOivi (6 miles east of Kokoda), after inflicting severe casualties on the enemy, whoare reported to have lost 900 killed out of a total force of two battalions. TheAustralian advanced forces, together with U.S. troops which have been advancingdown the Kumusi River, have now occupied the important river crossing atWairopi and are continuing their advance on Buna.Other U.S. forces proceeded by sea to a point 25 miles south-east of Buna,and are now approaching Buna by land.South Pacific.37. The enemy&apos;s attempt to reinforce on the Guadalcanal Island must beconsidered a failure and the U.S. forces, although probably outnumbered, areholding their own.Intelligence.France.38. It is estimated that 6-8 German divisions, including the 7th and10th Panzer divisions, have marched into the previously unoccupied zone ofFrance. Few details are as yet available as to their present distribution, butthe Germans appear to have occupied the Mediterranean coast from Perpignanto a few miles west of Toulon, leaving the Toulon area in French hands. Inaddition, it is believed that three Italian divisions, including one motoriseddivision, have moved in and are occupying the Mediterranean coast from east ofToulon to the frontier.Italy.39. There have been reports of considerable troop movements in Italy as aresult of recent events. These were to be expected and further extensive movesare likely to take place in the near future. In addition to the three divisionsmoved into France, elements of one division have been landed in Corsica. It isnot yet known what Italian troops, if any, are co-operating with the Germans in tunisia.AIR SITUATION.General Review.40.
