THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1942.MOST SECRET. Copy No. 1W.P. (42) 543.November 25, 1942.TOJBE JCEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.PLANS AND OPERATIONS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN, middle east AND NEAR EAST.Note by the Minister of Defence to the Chiefs of Staff.IN settling what to do in a vast war situation like this, it may sometimesbe found better to take a particular major operation to which one is committedand follow that through vigorously to the end, making other things subordinateto it, rather than to assemble all the data from the whole world scene in a bafflingarray. After the needs of the major operation have been satisfied so far aspossible, other aspects of the war will fall into their proper places. Moreover,it is by the continued stressing of the major operation that our will may be imposed upon the enemy and the initiative regained.2. The paramount task before us is, first, to conquer the African shores ofthe Mediterranean and set up there the naval and air installations which arenecessary to open an effective passage through it for military traffic; and,secondly, using the bases on the African shore to strike at the under-belly of the axis in effective strength and in the shortest time.[24659] b
3. There are therefore two phases consolidation and exploitation.Dealing with consolidation first, we may hope that General Alexander will becomemaster of the whole of Cyrenaica during the present month, and that he will bepressing the enemy in the Agheila position or even at Sirte. We may also assume that in the same period or not long after the American and British forces willbecome masters of the whole of French North Africa, including Tunis, provided they press forward with their present energy and violence.4. It will be necessary to set up Air stations at suitable intervals along allthe African shore in our power, but particularly and urgently in the Tunis tip.The largest installations for American bombers ought to be set up here so thatlong-range bombers sent by the United States to North Africa, together with american bombers already based on the Middle East, can operate against Italiantargets. The United States form of daylight attack would have its best chancein the better weather of the Mediterranean.5. The bombing weight of the British night attack should be brought tobear on Italy whenever the weather is more favourable than for bombingGermany. Every endeavour should be made to make Italy feel the weight ofthe war. All the industrial centres should be attacked in an intense fashion,every effort being made to render them uninhabitable and to terrorize and paralyzethe population.   I have asked for a scheme of desirable targets in Italy.6. It will no doubt be necessary also to act against the Catania and Cagliariairfields so as to keep down the attack on Tunis in the period of consolidation.7. As soon as we are sure of ourselves, and consolidated, in French north africa, including especially Tunis, two successive operations present themselves.The first is the advance to Tripoli. It is possible that General Alexander maybe able to take this important prize from the East, and I have asked him howhe feels about it, and how long he thinks it would require; but we must also beprepared for a rapid advance from the West. Would General Anderson&apos;s two british Divisions be sufficient, assuming that Tunis itself can be held by american and French Allied troops ? I should like the best possible estimate ofthe time that this will take.8. The second immediate objective is obviously either Sardinia or Sicily.The possession of either of these islands and of the airfields in the South would create an Air triangle, in which we should fight for and secure Air mastery.Moreover, from either of them continuous intensified short-range attacks onNaples, Rome, and the Italian fleet bases would raise the war against Italy to anintense degree. Let an immediate report be prepared in order that a decision can be taken. Whichever it may be, the fight for Air control in the central mediterranean should be undertaken as a great Air battle with extreme priority,the fullest advantage being taken of the Axis shortage of aircraft.
9. The swift success in French North Africa has completely changed thecharacter of the problem which we had been bound to face in that region. we need no longer contemplate a protracted campaign against French in Algeria,nor immediate trouble with the Spaniards in Morocco. On the contrary, all iswell in Algeria, and a French army will be coming into existence, fed by Alliedmunitions at our discretion. An examination should be made as to how the follow-up &quot; Torch &quot; convoys can be drastically reduced and revised. Will thefour British Divisions now in North Africa or under orders to go there berequired for &quot; Torch&quot; ? It should be possible sensibly to reduce the &quot; tail &quot; ofthese divisions, thus saving escorts for other purposes, including, in the followingorder : (a) Sardinia or Sicily.(b) Restoration of the British Trans-Atlantic convoys up to standardstrength.(c) Resumption of the P.Q. convoys in the latter part of December.To facilitate these vital needs, and to provide the large Naval, particularlyanti-submarine, forces which will be required, together with the necessary airforces, to secure a safe passage through the Mediterranean, United States navalhelp will be urgently needed. Cannot the American Naval authorities reduce thestrength of their follow-up trans-Atlantic convoys, and can the American &quot; tail&quot;be reduced in the same way as I hope the British &quot; tail&apos;&quot;&apos; will be combed ?10. What are General Eisenhower&apos;s wishes about the force to attackSardinia or Sicily ? There are two British Divisions of the First Army, as wellas the two others which are standing by. Is there any need to put the first twointo North Africa ? Can they not be combat loaded here ? Are the losses among our combat loaders crippling&apos;? How serious are they? There are great advantages and saving of time in going straight from the United Kingdom tothe landings in Sardinia or Sicily. We must expect a steady reinforcement ofboth islands by the enemy, and speed will make our task definitely lighter. note that the preparations to attack Sardinia may take as long as those to attackSicily, and that Sicily is by far the greater prize.Decisions on all the above are needed within the next week.11. The relief and re-supplying of Malta should follow naturally from theoperations now in progress or in prospect in the Central Mediterranean, and theimmediate needs of the island are being dealt with on an effective scale. It wouldbe well, when circumstances and shipping permit, to exchange the Units who have long been in the fortress for some of these who have been in the Desert, and vice versa.12. I have received a telegram from the President containing the following paragraph : &quot; It is hoped that you with your Chiefs of Staff in London and I withthe Combined Staff here may make a survey of the possibilities including[24659] b 2
forward movement directed against Sardinia, Sicily, Italy, Greece and otherBalkan areas, and including the possibility of obtaining Turkish support foran attack through the Black Sea against Germany&apos;s flank.&quot;I endorse the above conception by the President. The first part of the presidents wishes are being studied by the Combined Staffs in Washington,,and are the subject of the foregoing paragraphs for our discussions.13. The second part relating to Turkey is also of vital importance, thoughit is a slower process. A supreme and prolonged effort must be made to bringTurkey into the war in the Spring. We must expect that our naval forces and shipping, landing craft, &amp;c, will be fully engaged in the Central Mediterranean,and that only minor amphibious facilities will be available in the Levant. Accesscan, however, be had to Turkey by the railways through Syria as well as by coastal shipping, and by a gradual build-up of Air protection, not only Adalia,but the Dardanelles itself, might become open to supplies for Turkey. Troopscan move by rail and road from Syria.I wish to record my opinion that Turkey may be won if the proper measures are taken. Turkey is an Ally. She will wish to have a seat among the victorsat the Peace Conference. She has a great desire to be well armed. Her army is in good order except for the specialised modern weapons, in which the bulgarians have been given so great an advantage by the Germans. The TurkishArmy has been mobilised for nearly three years, and is warlike. Hitherto Turkeyhas been restrained by fear from fulfilling her obligations, and we have takenan indulgent view of her policy on account of our own inability to help. Thesituation has now changed.. ,By the destruction of Rommers Army, large forcesmay presently become available in Egypt and Cyrenaica. By a strengthenedRussian resistance and a possible counterstroke in the Caucasus, which we shouldurge upon the Russians with all emphasis, great easement will be secured in persia and the Tenth Army may be drawn upon. There is also the Ninth Armyin Syria. From all these sources it should be possible, on the assumption of theRussians maintaining themselves in the Caucasus, north of the mountain line,and holding the Caspian, to build up a powerful British land and air force toassist the Turks. A target date for the concentration should be April or May.Let me have proposals.14.   The following is the order of procedure, political and military : (a) Turkey should be offered a Russian-American-British guarantee of territorial integrity and status quo. The Russians have already agreed with us upon this. The addition of the United States wouldprobably be a decisive reassurance. This should be followed by thedespatch to Turkey of a strong Anglo-American Military Mission.(&amp;) All through the winter from now on, Turkey must be equipped from egypt and from the United States with tanks, A/T and A.A. guns,and active construction of airfields must be undertaken. We have been working upon airfield construction in Turkey for two years.   What
progress has been made so far 1 Now that Rommel has been beaten,there is evidently a surplus of material in Egypt. We had over 2,500tanks at the disposal of the Middle East Army. Much enemy materialhas been captured, both German and Italian. This is also true ofA/T and A.A. guns. Experts must be provided to assist the Turksin learning to use and maintain this material. A ceaseless flow of weapons and equipment must go into Turkey. We have already promised a consignment, but the moment Turkey agrees secretly withthe plan above, far greater quantities must be sent. What is the capacity of the railways from Syria to the Bosphorus and theDardanelles ? It would seem a great mistake to attack Rhodes andother islands in enemy hands in the Eastern Mediterranean until wehave got Turkey on our side. Any attacks can then be supported by heavy shore-based Air power. We have to creep round this coast bothby land and sea, building up our Air as we go.(c) In conjunction with the above, we should urge the Russians to develop their strength on their southern flank, to try to clear the Caucasus, to regain Novorossisk and, above all, to resume at the earliest date their intentions explained to me by Premier Stalin, of striking south-westfrom the region north of Stalingrad towards Rostov on the Don.An ultimate result of these operations, if successful, would be theopening of the Dardanelles under heavy Air protection, to the passageof supplies to Russian Black Sea ports, and to any naval assistance the Russians might require in the Black Sea./ s?\    T oo-flir      oil     iHoi&quot;no&quot;    txrcil 1     tutq    oV*/&quot;yn 1 r\     nocamKla    -i r\     Qtj-hi n     f V\ n    T2 yi-i f-i o vi        -m ^\Imperial forces mentioned in preceding paragraphs.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,November 25, 1942.
