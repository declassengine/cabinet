(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAKNIJD MAJESTY&apos;S     99ft. government! \7     &quot; - *   uW.P. (42)  561. COPY NO        O-JSECRETW.P.C42)  561.1st December.-1942.&apos; -WAR CABINET.MAN POWER.Note by the Minister-of Labour and National Service.I have examined the note W.P.(42) 556 and wish to make thefollowing observations.1,      In my view the proposed cut in the Women&apos;s Services is toosevere, while the numbers allocated to the Admiralty for ship-building, engineering, explosives, etc,, and to the Ministry of aircraft Production are too great.      It would be wrong to cut down the Services too severely on the problematical assumption that itis .possible for the shipbuilding and aircraft industries to expandat a rate substantially greater than has yet been found practicable.2.      I estimated that the supply of 1,600,000 would consist ofabout 950,000 men and 650,000 women.      The proposed cut in civil defence alters the situation to some extent.     Assuming the comb-out were on the basis of youngest first it would yield aconsiderable number of men for the Armed Forces.      I estimate that possibly an additional 70,000 men might become available for theForces, of which 50,000 might be allocated to the Army, 10,000 tothe Navy and. 10,000 to the R.A.P.      The supply of 1,600,000 wouldthen consist of 1,020,000 men and 580,000 women.3,      It must be remembered that neither all the men nor all thewomen are available for the Forces only or for industry only.      Inthe case of men,  only fit men of military age ara available forthe Forces.      In the case of women., they have an option of going into the Women1s Services or into industry.      In my view we mustnot do away with this option.      We must continue to allow them some measure of preference and not move them about when and how we likeas if they were pieces of material.    . My estimate was that we couldsupply 220,000 women for the Women&apos;s Services and we could onlydivert a proportion of these to industry by being even harsher withthem than we are at present,4. -  As regards the Naval programme the estimated requirement of186,000 for shipbuilding, engineering, explosives, etc.  is basedon a maximum expansion which I believe cannot be achieved.      Theexpansion achieved in the year ended mid-1942 was 89,000 and I donot think that the shipbuilding industry can at this stage expandsufficiently to enable more than 100,000 ih a year to be absorbedon all Admiralty work, including the engineering sideBAccordingly, I suggest that the figure for shipbuilding, etc. for18 months should be 150,000...5.     As regards the aircraft programme, the present rate of increase is about 25,000 a month,      I do not believe that the industry can absorb and effectively use more than this number.     Also, evenif- the Ministry of Supply programme is substantially reduced, as suggested, I consider it will be extremely difficult to supply theaircraft industry with more than 25,000 a month, having regard tothe exceptional difficulties involved in the transfer of labour.Moreover, the expansion demanded by .k,A,P, could only be achieved
by a vast extension, of night-shift working.     This would necessarily involve a very.substantial increase in the employmentof highly skilled labour which does not exist.      The estimated requirements of this industry have always been high and myexperience leads me to believe that the aircraft programme couldbe achieved with.the addition of about 450,000,      I accordinglysuggest that there should be a cut of 153,000. . &apos; -6.     As regards the comb-out of men and women from GovernmentDepartments the position is that the rapidly increasing staffsare a serious drain on man-power     there was an increase of100,000 in the year ended mid-1942 and the increase is continuingIt is not a case of &quot;getting a few hundred highly trainedindividuals&quot; - out of Government Departments y- but of c ombing outlarge numbers of young women, many of whom can., I am sure, be3pared and others of whom should be replaced by part-time women,7.     In the light of the above, I suggest that the table in-paragraph 9 of the Prime Minister! s memorandum.should be modified as follows:- &apos; &quot;&apos;. .Original DemandsCut Proposed60186 - ( shipbuilding,- -   engineering,: explosive s,&amp;c)36Supply148215R.A.F.MenWomenM.
