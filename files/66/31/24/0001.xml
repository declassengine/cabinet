THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT7Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1942.SECRET. Copy No;W.P. (42) 544.December 5, 1942./WAR CABINET.COLONIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for.Foreign Affairs, the Lord Privy Seal and the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.RECENT events in America, which are certainly not unconnected with thelocal political situation, have raised the Colonial question in an acute form. It istrue that Mr. Luce&apos;s article in Life was to some extent a boomerang and may havedone more good than harm. But Mr. Willkie&apos;s speech may have more serious effects and is undoubtedly typical of a widespread, though quite misguided,feeling in America that there is something archaic in the conception of the british colonial Empire and that some new system ought to be substituted for it more inaccordance with the spirit of the times.2. We are united in thinking that the time has come when His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should counter this feeling by issuing some statement to which it ishoped publicity will be given in the United States. It is, indeed, certain that much criticism in America is the result of almost complete ignorance regardingconditions in British Colonial territories, and the speech this week by the leader of the House of Lords will have contributed to enlightenment in that respect.3. But enlightenment on these facts is only part of the problem. In addition,,we must, if we can, endeavour to get the United States to express their willingness to enter some general defence scheme which would include the defenceof Colonial areas. It is also desirable to commit the Americans, if possible, tothe principle that we and the other Colonial Powers concerned should have theunquestioned right to administer our own Colonies, Protectorates and mandated territories, including those which we have temporarily lost to the Japanese.Finally, it would be highly desirable to achieve a crystallisation in a form notunfavourable to ourselves of the existing vague but widely-held theories regardingColonies. These suggest that all Colonial Powers should be regarded as trustees,bound to take due account of the interests not only of the local population but ofthe world, as a whole. It is quite true that this principle of trusteeship has long been accepted so far as the British Empire is concerned, but there would be every advantage in getting it accepted by other Colonial Powers as well. All the objectives cannot be achieved by ourselves alone : at the least, joint Anglo-American-Dutch action is required.4. In his telegram No. 4285 of the 25th August (Annex I) Lord Halifaxreported a conversation with Mr. Hull in which the latter expressed his desire^to proceed with some Joint Declaration regarding Colonial Empires, andintroduced the term &quot; Parent States.&quot; In many ways Mr. Hull&apos;s attitude as.revealed in this telegram is unexpectedly satisfactory, particularly his desire-to include in such a Joint Declaration some &quot;very clear expression againstofficious intervention from outside with affairs which were the responsibility ofthe Parent State.&quot;5. As the result of our discussions&apos;, we now recommend that (after thenecessary consultation with the Dominions has taken place) two telegrams shouldbe addressed to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington as in the drafts which[24590]
form the second annex to this paper. We are all agreed that something on theselines is necessary if only to enable us to keep the initiative in our hands. Weare afraid that if no response is made to Mr. hull&apos;s  proposal we shall be faced,in the near future, with some American initiative of a less friendly character.Our colleagues have seen what Mr. Wendell Willkie said to Sir A. Clark Kerrabout the attitude of American public opinion towards the British Empire.All the information at our disposal goes to show that Mr. Willkie&apos;s estimate ofthe outlook of many of his fellow-countrymen is a correct one. The administration has for long been under pressure to issue some kind of Declaration on colonial territories. They have resisted this pressure and no doubt they will continue to resist it to the best of their ability. But the time will come when they are obligedto declare their attitude. In the meantime, they have expressed a wish to be associated with us (possibly with others) in a joint Colonial Declaration, of a character which, if Mr. Hull&apos;s view is final, would not be damaging to our interests. For these reasons and for those given in paragraph 3 above, we are-convinced that we should respond to Mr. Hull&apos;s approach and enter into informal conversations with him on the basis of our own agreed plan.6. In regard to details, it will be noted that we have not followed upMr. Huirs suggestion that the Declaration should &quot;re-assert some of theprinciples of his speech, i.e., the necessity for fitness for and willingness to fight for freedom, &amp;c. . . .&quot; It would indeed be dangerous at this stage to come outwith some statement which might be taken as an implied threat to deprive suchnations as Portugal and Spain of their Colonies on the grounds that they were reluctant to participate in the war. Moreover, the French aspect is still verydelicate and it would hardly be wise to create the impression that we were goingoack on the assurances given by the United States and ourselves to France, whetherexplicit or conditional. Equally, it would be unfortunate to suggest that anyColony which had contributed men to, for instance, the King&apos;s African Rifles,had qualified for self-government by that alone.7. We consider that it would be useful to be ready to discuss with the americans as soon as these general principles had been accepted and published,their practical application to particular regions. For this purpose South-Eastern Asia would seem to be the area in which a beginning might be made.South-Eastern Asia is in many ways a special case, since (a) it has been almostentirely occupied by Japan; (b) common defence in that area is more urgent thanit is in other Colonial areas: (c) it is an area in which the United States havepractical experience of Colonial administration.8. For all these reasons we trust that the Cabinet will agree that after thenecessary consultation with the Dominions two telegrams should be despatched to washington on the lines of the attached drafts.C.

ANNEX I.Viscount Halifax to Mr. Eden.- (Received, August 25, 1942,)(No. 4285.)(Telegraphic.) Washington, August 25, 1942.I HAD long talk to Hull this morning. We began on his speech and herepeated pleasure with which he had received your message. He developed atsome length main ideas that he had sought to express and said that president had been personally concerned with getting speech fullest radio publicity. Thisis perhaps interesting from angle of alleged divergence of thought between Hulland Wallace. He had been very well satisfied with reception accorded to his speech here.2. He then spoke at length on how statements of Atlantic Charter could best be utilised to guide opinion wisely in relation to backward peoples ofdiffering grades and capacities and said that his idea was to get some general statement in which we might all assert broad purposes making plain thatattainment of freedom involved mutual responsibility of what he called parentStates and of those who aspired to it. He would like to reassert some of principles of his speech, i.e., necessity of fitness for and willingness to fight for freedom, &amp;c, and especially paramount necessity at this stage of winningwar. This with an eye on India. He thought by such means it would not bedifficult to reconcile slightly differing comments in this regard that president and Prime Minister had made on Atlantic Charter.3. I agreed with him that there was nothing in this sort of thing thathe had said which conflicted with what was our own thought and practicethroughout Empire but that we were very conscious of two dangers. One wasgiving any encouragement to Chiang Kai-shek that it was his job to run empireor tell us how to do it and other was that of attempting over-simplificationwhich would fit India, Jamaica and Nyasaland all at once. I then told him that I had some talk with Colonial Secretary in London who was consideringseeking Cabinet approval for some unilateral statement which I thought might very well be in close accord with general views Hull had expressed. This might in Cranborne&apos;s view be best way of avoiding dangers to which I had referred.4. Hull, though disclaiming any right or desire to intrude in our business,was not convinced of wisdom of such unilateral action. It would not havenearly so much weight here or indeed elsewhere as a joint declaration of purposewhich,would have what he termed great defensive value. For he would include a very clear expression against officious intervention from outside with affairs which were responsibility of parent State and wide variety of problem couldbe appropriately stressed.5. I asked him who he had in mind should join in such a statement Ihoped not all United Nations. He said he thought &quot; a few of principal nations,&quot;which I interpreted with his assent to mean United States, ourselves and Dutch.He added that Chinese always had an inferiority complex vis-a-vis United Statesand ourselves and he would like to bring them into it. They would not do anyharm and it would soothe feeling.6. I told him that I would certainly put to you his suggestions whichat this stage were only tentative.7. I had thought of asking him to put his ideas in more precise form on paper but held off this thinking it better to keep it all fluid. I think there is some force in what he said in paragraph 4 above as to the defensive strengthagainst ignorant clamour provided we could agree on the non-intervention partof statement. And it is clear to me that Hull has been pondering this approachpretty carefully and will take a good deal of shifting off it.ANNEX II.Draft Telegrams to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington.(Secret.)YOUB telegram No. 4285 [projected Joint Declaration on colonial policy].We have been giving careful thought to this matter in the light of the remarks of Mr. Hull and Mr. Sumner Welles. We are greatly attracted byMr. Hull&apos;s conception of &quot; Parent States,&quot; and something on the lines of his
remarks on that point would be an essential basis of any Declaration. before reaching any final decision as to the precise terms of the Declaration, we should like to have your own comments and advice on the idea of your sounding Mr. Hullon that point and others in the following list which together might form basis of delclaration of nature which he seems to have in mind : (1) First aim of United Nations is to defeat present aggression and renderfuture aggression impossible.(2) This aim requires for its successful achievement the establishment of;conditions under which security and prosperity can be assured to all nations. Since it is evident that there are certain peoples whosesocial equipment and resources are not yet such as to enable them to.achieve these ends by themselves, it will be a clear responsibility of allparent States to enter into general defence schemes designed to ensurefreedom from fear for all peoples.(3) Defence having been assured, the parent States must aim to promote thesocial, economic and political well-being of peoples who are unable,without danger to themselves and to others, to assume full responsi-bility for their affairs. The parent States, with their special qualifications for the task, must accept the duty of moulding and extending the social and political institutions of the territories withwhich they are concerned that they may become capable of dischargingin due course the full responsibilities of government.(4) By this combination of defence and scientific and ordered development,the parent States will thus fulfil their responsibilities to those peoples and enable them to enjoy rising standards of life and to continue to advance on the path of progress. In pursuance of this policy thenatural resources of Colonial territories will be organised andmarketed, not for the promotion of purely commercial ends, but in thebest interests of the peoples concerned and of the world as a whole.(B)(Secret.)My immediately preceding telegram on subject of projected Joint, declaration on Colonial Policy.If Mr. Hull agreed that general Declaration on these lines fitted in with hisideas you should proceed to explain to him that we think practical applicationof the principles set out in the Joint Declaration would need to be discussed and agreed as soon as Declaration had been published. You should explain to himprivately that our present line of thought is (a) That necessary practical measures would take the form of machinery for consultation and collaboration between parent States with the aim of ensuring a common policy in those regions of the world in which theyhave interests as parent States. For this purpose Regional Corn-missions composed of representatives of such States should be constituted. Provision should also be made for the representation ofnations which have a major defence or economic interest in the regionsconcerned. Such regions might be, first, the Far East; secondly,Africa; and, thirdly, the Western Atlantic, and any others which ata later stage may seem appropriate.(b) That within this framework and subject to the principles laid down inparagraphs (2) and (3) of the Joint Declaration responsibility for administration of its own territories would rest with the individualparent State concerned.You could eventually explain to Mr. Hull that as soon as- the generalDeclaration has been.agreed and published we should be very glad to proceed todiscuss with him privately its particular application to the Far East, in regardto which it might be possible to get out a detailed Declaration before tackling the:more difficult question of Africa.
