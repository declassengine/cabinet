(42) 533.November 19, 1942.WAR CABINET.POLITICAL SITUATION IN THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a despatch by Lord Harlechon the basic political factors in the Union of South Africa.The despatch gives a comprehensive picture of the background, racial,denominational, economic and provincial against which political leaders andparties in South Africa play their roles. Lord Harlech adds that if the comingGeneral Election in South Africa is held during the war doubtless the warissue will be dominant, and he thinks General Smuts will win; but sooner or later the issue at a general election in South Africa will be that betweencontinuance of our present partnership and complete independence. He has told me that it is because he feels this to be so that he has attempted in this despatch to analyse the forces at work, in order that there may be no illusions among those responsible for policy in London.. C. R. A.Dominions Office, Downing Sreet, S.W.j-1,November 19, 1942.Despatch from the United Kingdom High Commissioner in theUnion of South Africa.Sir, August 29, 1942.FOR some time since my arrival in the Union the need has been apparent tome of supplementing the despatches and telegrams on political affairs which aresent at fairly frequent intervals from this post with a more general analysis of thepolitical background. In particular I have felt that an account should begiven of the forces (some of them thrown into prominence by present conditions)which are likely to influence the future political development of South Africa.Under the impact of war the social structure of the Union is in the midst ofsignificant changes. The apparent equilibrium of the prosperous pre-war years is being overthrown; rifts which were discernible on the surface have widened intofissures; and in many fields, ideas and principles which seemed almost part of thenatural order are now being called violently into question. The conflict betweenthe two sections of the white population has been stimulated to a new intensity;but even now it is becoming overshadowed in the minds of thinking men by the progressive, awakening of the non-European peoples. If this despatch has grownto an inordinate length I must plead in mitigation that it is impossible in a country of such complexity as this tq set out anything like a true and balanced[24647] B ,
picture within the narrow limits dictated by convenience. I have accordinglydivided my subject into the following sections, which indicate the aim I have setmyself : (A) Introduction;(B) Background of Afrikaner Nationalism;(C) Nationalism and the War;(D) The Political Opposition;(E) The English-speaking People;(F) The immediate Political Conflict;(G) Bantu, Cape Coloured and Indians.(A) Introduction.2. The development of the Union is regarded by the dominant school ofSouth African historians and by the great majority of the white population asthe story of the conquest of the wilderness, the beating down of &apos;&apos; blackbarbarism,&quot; and the building of a &quot; White South Africa.&quot; Until the Great Trekjust over a century ago initiated the dispersion of the European populationthrough the interior uplands, contacts between white and black had been limitedto the border districts of the Eastern Cape. Here European farmers, impelledby chronic land hunger and impatience with Government control from Cape Town,came into conflict with the Bantu tribes moving southwards down the coastal beltunder the pressure of Zulu &apos;; aggression.&quot; Such racial problems as had earlierexisted had sprung from the presence of a coloured population descended fromEuropean settlers and Malay slaves and Hottentots; but the coloured people had never threatened to outnumber the Europeans, and by 1828 an ordinance promulgated-gated by the British Administration had given them the rights of equal citizenshipand struck a powerful blow at the efforts that were being made locally to reducethem to a servile status. It seemed then as if the way was open for theirassimilation by the European society; and it has been left for the morbid racialconsciousness of recent years finally to destroy that liberal prospect, and once again to emphasise the separateness of the coloured people and their partialexclusion from citizen rights.3. The Great Trek, the core round which has developed the whole of theAfrikaner folk-myth, was an attempt to outflank the southward-moving Bantu;but its effect was vastly to extend the frontiers of racial contact. Henceforth themain theme of South African development was not the growth of a settlement of europeans, but of a wholly new and unique society of different races and culturalattainments, fashioned by conflicts of racial heredity and the opposition ofunequal social groups. For the best part of a hundred years the Europeans have sought to build up a stable and prosperous &apos;&apos; White South Africa &apos;&apos; on the basisof cheap native labour; but the existence of a poor white population of 400,000submerged beneath the level of tolerable existence is the measure of their failure.While other Dominions received a fruitful flow of immigration, the .stream of immigrants that was needed to give the exiguous white population of SouthAfrica the self-confidence bred of numbers passed the country by : in a country where the unskilled work in towns and countryside was the monopoly of thenative there was little to attract the type of British immigrant who found a newfreedom and breadth of opportunity in Australia and New Zealand. South Africa&apos;simmigrants were, in fact, mainly the Bantu; and by the time that the discovery ofdiamonds and of gold first gave an impetus to a backward agricultural economywhite and black were already far on the way to a new society, in which bothelements were bound togther in the most intimate of economic relationships. Onthe one hand, Bantu tribal society has been progressively shattered by the impact of European economy and the methods of native administration adoptedby Governments; on the other, the whole development of the white man&apos;s socialsystem has been determined more than any one factor by its dependence on cheapnative labour. The mutual dependence of white and black in South Africa isa fact which deserves the most persistent emphasis, just because the prevailingEuropean policies and aspirations are still based on the impracticable assumptionthat it is possible to build up a White South Africa independent of the Bantupopulation, which outnumbers it by almost five to one. The contending sectionsof the dominant white population still imagine that they can afford 4lie luxuryof internecine quarrel : but, if one thing is certain, it is that the problem of therelations between Boer and Briton will be as nothing compared with the obstinacyand danger of the problem that will arise when the white people of this country,
in the not distant future, are confronted by the effective pressure of the non-European people for their rightful opportunities in the political and the economicspheres.4. But if in the long view it is almost, true to say that the only problemthat matters has to do with the economic and political place to be occupied bythe Bantu in the social structure of the Union, effective political and physicalpower still rests in the hands of the contending white groups; and in the vitalpost-war years it will be the European population alone that will decide theUnion&apos;s attitude towards the British Commonwealth and the world at large. Forthis reason it is obviously of prime importance to analyse the forces that willinfluence the policies of the dominant white population. In the paragraphs thatfollow I shall describe in some detail the relationships between the Afrikaans-and English-speaking groups of white South Africa and the tendencies that may decide the issue of present political differences; this will be followed in aconcluding section by a general account of the present condition of the Bantu,the Cape Coloured and the Indian population of the Union and of the factorsthat are influencing their relationship with the Europeans who dominate thesocial and-political structure.(B) The Background of Afrikaner Nationalism.5. The European population of the Union was estimated by the censusauthorities in 1940 to be 2,250,000. Of this total 40 per cent, gave their homelanguage as English, and 56 per cent, declared it to be Afrikaans. Only 2-5per cent, used English and Afrikaans indiscriminately. These figures are not an accurate guide to racial origins, since the figure of the English-speaking sectionincludes large numbers of South Africans of Dutch or Huguenot descent,especially in the long-settled Western Cape, who became Anglicised in the early-days of British rule before an Afrikaner nationalism was heard of. ; Well-knownexamples of this tendency are the Van der ByTs, the Cloete&apos;s, the le Mesurier&apos;s,the du Toifs and some branches of the great de Villiers clan. Examples of the reverse tendency are much harder to come by and it is clear that English, as adominant world culture throughout the formative period of South African history,has attracted vastly more adherents than it has lost to the youthful and aggressiveAfrikaner culture. Afrikaner families such as Conroy, Collins (both represented in the present Cabinet) and. Brebner are descended in the main from Irishmen,Scots and Englishmen who had made their homes in the Boer republics before theSouth African war and loyally did their duty as burghers of those republics.Moreover, among the English-speaking population are included the Jews, who now number no less than 100,000, or nearly five per cent, of the total european population.6. If, however, language does not wholly coincide with race, it is the language division that cuts across the whole of South African life. It obtrudesitself most of all in the cultural and political spheres &quot;(which in recent years have come near to over-lapping) and in religion, commerce and even sport. Withthe rise of an exclusive and fanatical Afrikaner nationalism, the English-speakingpeople would before this have been reduced to the position of a disgruntled racialminority had not it been able to enlist the constant support of a section offmoderate Afrikaans-speaking people who have turned the balance in the English-speaking section&apos;s favour. The census figures disclose a total of about 950,000English-speaking South Africans as compared, with 1,300,000 Afrikaners. But,whereas, the English-speaking section maintains an almost unbroken solidarityfor major political purposes, it has been estimated by an acute observer that atleast 300,000 Afrikaners are supporters of General Smuts and the principle of racial co-operation; while the upholders of Afrikaner racial domination are splitinto numerous factions by ambitious ftihrers contending for the leadership ofa &quot; united Afrikanerdom &quot; which has never achieved a semblance of unity.7. In a recent leading article Die Volksblad, the Nationalist organ inBloemfontein. declared that &quot;the fact is tragic but true that the relationship between the two white races is to-day, after thirty years of Union and fortyyears of peace between Boer and Briton, infinitely worse than in the years immediately following the &apos; War for Freedom.&apos; &quot; It went on to blame the&quot;jingoism&quot; of the British, who, not content with the conciliatory attitude ofGenerals Botha and Smuts, had, set out to dominate the country and had foughtwith the utmost bitterness all advances of the Afrikaner towards political and[24647] b 2
cultural freedom. This deterioration of relations between Boer and Briton inrecent years, and especially during the present war, is evident to everyone. ButDie Volksblad is taking a professedly partial view when it throws the blame onthe English-speaking people. There is equal truth in the bitter gibes from theEnglish-speaking side at the intransigent nationalism which parades a sympathy with Germany and openly states its desire to establish a republic in SouthAfrica in which full citizen rights would be confined to a group chosen accordingto a most rigorous code of racial and linguistic qualifications.Cultural Incompatibility.   .8. The causes of the present bitterness must be sought in the history ofSouth Africa during the past century and a half and in the cultural incompati-bility of two races with vastly different backgrounds. The early years of british rule in the Cape are remembered as the time when a &apos;&apos; foreign &apos;&apos; Government,representing the liberal spirit then awakening in Europe, set about subvertingthe established social relationships in its distant possession at the Cape by thefreeing of the slaves, the promulgation of ordinances which gave the rights of free men to the Cape Coloured, population and by allowing the representatives ofthe London Missionary Society to preach the what seemed to them odious doctrine of the equality of all men in the sight of God. The Great Trek of the Boerfarmers from the eastern districts of the Cape in 1837 and the succeedingyears was fundamentally stimulated by a land hunger thwarted by the movementof the Bantu tribes down the coastal fringe from Natal; but by the inevitableprocess of rationalisation the Trek was explained and justified as a protest against the oppressive actions of a distant Government in London and as anattempt to re-establish in the northern lands a &apos;&apos; proper &apos;&apos; relationship of sub-ordination between black and white. The Boer farmers entered the appallinghazards of the wilderness fortified in spirit by the teachings of an Old Testamentwhich seemed to have a special relevance to the experiences through which theywere passing. They, too, were a primitive pastoral people moving through thewilderness to a Promised Land, deeply conscious that they were elected of God toa high and peculiar destiny. Their most active religious beliefs were the heritageof the French Calvinists who had sought refuge at the Cape after the revocationof the Edict of Nanes and brought to the people with whom they- were so soon to be assimilated a robust faith in the Calvinist doctrine of predestination. More-over, from their readings of the Old Testament they had learnt of the curse of -Ham; and clearly no doctrine was more suitably conceived to give the sanction of religion to their dealings with African natives. A people unschooled in booklearning, cut off by vast distances and a whole world of religious dogmatism fromthe liberalising philosophies of the French revolution, the Boers had given theirallegiance to the fierce tribal God of the pre-exilic Israelites, who knew no milk-and-water doctrines of the brotherhood of man.9. In the republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State the emigrantBoers established a simple pastoral economy and Governments remarkable for the respect they showed for the liberties of the citizen and the security of private property; but even here the fierce particularism of the Boers had to seek outletsin the establishment of various short-lived and petty independent republics on the borders of authority. Certainly, Government authority, like the writs of Englishmedieval kings, was effective only in the narrowest of limits; and the Transvaalrepublic was more than once torn by the conflicts of men ambitious to rule. Afteryears of great hardship and heroic achievement the Boers had tamed the wilder-ness and crushed the military power of the Zulus; and as a result pf innumerableexpeditions against local Bantu chieftains they had brought new tracts of country within their power and ownership and thousands of its native inhabitantsinto their service. A &quot; proper relationship &quot; between black and white, untingedby any hint of a liberal attitude, had been established; the Boers, true to theirCalvinist tradition, betrayed, no proselytising enthusiasm; and it was left, to their ...)patriarchal spirit to mitigate the worst asperities of the relations between masterand servant.Industrial Revolution and the Boers.10. Into this condition of rural backwardness and primitive simplicitythere burst the 19th century industrial revolution, drawn by the discovery ofdiamonds and of gold. For half a century the Boers on their secluded plateau hadbeen developing a society untouched by the industrial capitalism that was trans-forming the world.  Gold-mining brought confusion and bewilderment and a host
of &apos;&apos; uitlanders &apos;&apos; who opposed the brazen values of cosmopolitan finance and urban life to the claim of a landholding society that set immense store by tradition.To the Boers Joseph Chamberlain was the embodiment of that sinister alliance between the British Government, industrialism and finance which was bent ondestroying the independence and traditional way of life of a proud people rootedin the soil. The war of 1899-1902 inaugurated the new phase in the relations ofBoer and Briton. The English, who pride themselves on their ability to forgiveand forget, are too prone to believe that the generosity of Campbell-Bannermanwas ample amends for the sufferings which the war had inflicted on the Boerpeople; in any case they are not the people to brood on past injuries. But, in the minds of the Afrikaner people, in whom the memory of the suffering is keptawake by the bitterness of defeat, the Boer War still stands out as the supremeinjury. It is true that an Afrikaner like Smuts, with great philosophic insight,has succeeded in subordinating this bitterness to the Commonwealth ideal; that aman of great humanity, such as Botha, could within a few years respond to Britishstatesmanship by preaching the doctrine of conciliation, and that a host of lessermen have refused to give their lives to a secular hatred and have instead sought the paths of racial co-operation. In a world eaten away by cancerous nationalismsit was, perhaps, not to be expected that the Afrikaner people could resist thecontagion. The Boer War provided it with a national tradition, the pride ofmilitary achievement in a long struggle against the greatest of the World Powers,and the Women&apos;s Monument at Bloemfontein to commemorate the deaths of women and children in the British concentration camps.11. Some years ago it was generally believed that racial hatred would decline when the generation that had endured the Boer War had given way to ageneration that has grown up in the peace. The trends of the. past few years,and particularly in this war, have finally dispelled that comfortable belief. It isin the Afrikaans-medium Universities of Stellenbosch, Pretoria and Potchef-stroom that the nationalist spirit is most vehement; and it is there that the revengefor the national martyrdom of the &quot; Second War of Freedom &quot; is most ardentlypreached. The Nationalists&apos; most constantly proclaimed aim is the recreationof the republican freedom which was destroyed by the war. It is to the Afrikaneryouth that the new racial doctrines imported from Nazi Germany make the strongest appeal. Recent years have seen an increasing flow from the Afrikaanspublishing houses of books purporting to describe from personal experience various aspects of the Boer War : one published as recently as 1938 repeated the wretchedlibel that the British had mixed ground glass into the sugar provided at a certainconcentration camp; and the burning of the farmhouses is described in luriddetail. A propagandist of ingenuity translated a pamphlet written byMr. Ramsay MacDonald describing a visit to South Africa after the Peace ofVereeniging and denouncing with an edifying fervour British policy in SouthAfrica both before and after the struggle. ,Growth of Afrikaans Language.12. The development of Afrikaner nationalism is an interesting study of how a movement whose primary aim was to secure the recognition of languagerights has ended up in an exclusive racialism which denies the rights of citizen-ship to other racial groups which inhabit the same State. The growth ofAfrikaans to the status of literary respectability has been rapid and remarkable.Founded on the patois of Dutch which the white inhabitants of the Cape usedin talking with their Hottentot servants, Afrikaans first attained the rank ofa, written language when a Reverend Mr. du Toit founded a newspaper,Die Patroit, at Paarl in the &apos;&apos; seventies &apos;&apos; of the last century. Gradually a school of poets arose who found in the Afrikaans idiom a suitable medium for theexpression of moods and attitudes appropriate to a primitive pastoral society.In later years Afrikaans has acquired a large body of poetry imbued with the true lyrical spirit, novels describing in sentimental terms the life of the veldand stories of animal life of considerable literary merit. A handful of writershave in recent years tried their hands at the modern psychological novel, withresults which are naive and crude in the extreme. The establishment of theSouth African Academy brought order into spelling and grammar; but it waslong before the older generation of educated Afrikaners would allow the use of&quot; kitchen Dutch &quot; in conversation between themselves; it is significant that theAfrikaans employed in Parliament by General Hertzog, the prime mover for official recognition of Afrikaans, was strongly reminiscent of &quot;Hollands&quot;;General Smuts still uses Netherlandish expressions which grate on-the ears of the
pedants of the Afrikaner Academy, whose aim is to secure the maximum practicable differentiation between Afrikaans and High Dutch. With theappearance in 1933 of the Afrikaans translation of the Bible the seal seemedset at last on the status of Afrikaans as a language of cultivated people.13. General Hertzog laid the foundations of his influence by his champion-ship of the rights of the Dutch language in the educational system of the OrangeFree State in the years after the Boer War. Lord Milner had instituted asystem of State education whose intention was the Anglicising of the Boerpopulation of the conquered republics. General Hertzog&apos;s Christian Nationalschools, which had an obvious purpose, found great difficulty in competing withthe State-subsidised system; but they did stake an effective claim for the equalrecognition of Dutch; and in 1910 the Constitution recognised English and High )Dutch as the official languages of the newly-founded Union. It was not until1925 that an amending Act was passed through Parliament by the firstNationalist Government defining &quot;Dutch&quot; as including &quot;Afrikaans.&quot;. the granting of legal equality to the Dutch language was, however, a long way fromfull equality in practice. In the years after unification Nationalist propagandathrove on the inertia and prejudice that hindered the use of Afrikaans on an equalbasis with English; and during the first Nationalist administration the Govern-ment found in it an effective instrument for the progressive &quot; Afrikanerising &quot;of the Civil Service. During these years the lives of British-born officials weremade unhappy by continual circulars enquiring into their progress in Afrikaans.Many, out of a mistaken and somewhat narrow-minded stubbornness, made nosecret of their contempt for the new language; and these officials, as a whole,were passed over whenever possi ble for promotion to senior posts on the grounds of their lack of bilingual qualifications. With the onset of the economicdepression in 1929 many were retrenched on the same grounds.The Dutch Reformed Churches.14. The Afrikaans language is one example of how the Nationalistmovement has used cultural forces for political ends. Another is to be foundin the field of religion. In the census of 1936, out of a white population of just over 2 million, 1,088,000 described themselves as adherents of one or other of theDutch Reformed Churches. These churches are conservatively Calvinist andtheir predikants wield great political as well as spiritual influence. They areuncompromising exponents of isolationism from Europe and have no connexionwith the parent church in Holland. A significant fact is the dominance in the churches of Afrikaners of French Huguenot extraction. Names like Malan (thepresent leader of the Nationalist Party himself began life as a predikant),du Toit, Malherbe, du Plessis, bulk large in the ministry. As descendants of religious outcasts from their country of origin their influence has been powerfulin weaning the Dutch, with whom they are so intermixed, from a sentimentalattachment to Holland. It is they who have been most active in the process of substituting Afrikaans for Dutch in the liturgy and in the translation of theBible. For them the test of a good South African is freedom from any additionalattachments or loyalties outside the Union. Europeanism or Catholicism inany form is repugnant. The Bible, and particularly the Old Testament asinterpreted by the South African synods of the Dutch Reformed Church, is theverbally inspired Word of God. It is less than 20 years ago that a leadingStellenbosch divine was expelled from the Church and deprived of his professorialchair for deviation from fundamentalist orthodoxy of the most primitive kind.Believing as they do in predestination, election and an eternal physical Hellhereafter for all save the elect, the Afrikaners conceive themselves as a chosenand separate minority of saved people in&apos; an environment of a damned majority.This religious determinism obviously provides little stimulus to save the soul ofthe heathen; and it is no accident that the Dutch Reformed Church, whose .adherents outnumber the white members of all other Christian churches combined. &apos;by almost two to one, should be so backward in missionary activity among the natives. (It must, of course, be remembered that the Anglican, Presbyterian andMethodist missions, which have such an honourable record of educational activity in this country, have, at least until recent years, drawn most of their financial support from the parent bodies in England and Scotland.) In the past year or so the Dutch Reformed Church has begun to take a more lively interest in the religious welfare of the Cape coloured people,.but it is difficult to determine towhat extent this interest is inspired by concern for their souls or for their votes,which still hold the balance of power in several constituencies of the WesternCape.
15. Figures of native converts are instructive. The Dutch ReformedChurches have only 154,000 native adherents as compared with nearly 2 millionbelonging to the other principal Christian communions. They maintain the mostrigorous separation between white and black, and natives are not allowed intochurch buildings reserved for white congregations. The willingness to leave theheathen non-elect in outer darkness has its influence in the political field, wherethe Nationalist party now announces without apology its intention to exclude from &quot;civic rights in its republic all Jews, &quot;Jingoes&quot; and everyone who hasnot proved his undivided allegiance to South Africa and the republicanideal. In the past few years bridges that had been built by painstakingeffort between the Dutch Reformed Church and the English-speakingChristian Churches have broken down. Its representatives have been withdrawn from the Christian Council, which had promised over a numberof years to develop into a useful instrument of co-operation betweenthe churches. The main complaints were that some of the representatives of theEnglish churches could not conduct discussions in Afrikaans and that the DutchChurch could no longer tolerate the &apos;&apos; Liberal&apos;&apos; attitude of the other bodies in questions of colour. Similarly, the Dutch Reformed Church withdrew its agree-ment to take part in the World Sunday School Conference which was due to beheld at Durban (and was finally cancelled on account of the war), when it learntthat non-European representatives were to be present.16. The Dutch Reformed Church is wealthy and wields a potent political influence which is almost solidly on the side of the Nationalist Party. More thana handful of predikants have graduated from the pulpit to Parliament; andsome of them, like the egregious Mr. du Toit, who is a convert to the New Orderof Mr. Pirow, have gone to the extreme in their advocacy of racial exclusivenessand the stimulation of racial hatreds. A Reverend Mr. Kotze, of Bloemfontein,was for some years Chairman of the Ossewa Brandwag, and in that capacitywas notable for his virulent attacks on the English-speaking section. It is noexaggeration to say that predikants. especially in the platteland, are active inthe narrowly political, no less than in the religious, guidance of their flocks andthat their influence, with negligible exceptions, is consistently on the side ofthe Opposition. Indications of their attitude on the war issue are to be foundin the frequent reports of predikants refusing soldiers in uniform admittance toto their churches, and there have been two cases reported in the Nationalist Pressrecently where predikants have without any attempt at dissuasion baptisedinfants with the names of Adolf Hitler. They have strongly backed theNationalist Party in the factitious agitation against the Governments allegedintention to give military training and arms to non-Europeans in the Army,supporting the protests by solemn affirmations that such a policy is &quot; expresslyforbidden by the word of God.&quot; In synod assembled they have given .theirblessing to the movement for a &quot; Christian National &quot; republic on the grounds that such an institution is a necessary part of the destiny laid down by God forthe Afrikaner people. The drift from the platteland to the towns which hasbeen greatly accelerated in recent years is leading to some diminution in thepolitical power of the predikant, and the Dutch Reformed Church is beginning to show concern over the fate of its &apos;&apos; wandering sheep &apos;&apos; in the towns, especially on the Witwatersrand.Economic Racialism.17. Afrikaner particularism is now reaching into every sphere of thenational life. Even in commerce and finance,- for which the Afrikaner has in the.past shown little aptitude, organised Afrikaner competition is beginning to arouse the fears of the old-established British and Jewish firms. In its negativeaspect Afrikaner economic racialism is organised principally by the ossewa brandwag, and is directed mainly into the boycott of non-Afrikaner shopkeepers,doctors and lawyers in the platteland (the large departmental stores in the townsare also affected, though to a lesser degree). Until the general shortage of goodsfirst made itself felt a few months ago, there were reports of a growing boycottin the country districts directed principally against the Jews, who make up themajority of country shopkeepers. An observer who revisited the Orange FreeState after an absence of six months says that he was &apos;&apos; shocked &apos;&apos; at the changethat had taken place.: A boycott, watertight and effective, had been organised in every town and district; and because it made much of its aims of socialrehabilitation of the poor white, it derived a good deal of support from thosevery Afrikaners who called themselves progressive and moderate. &quot; The Jewwho for forty years has had close contact with Afrikaners finds that overnight
all contact is lost. In its place he finds a highly-charged atmosphere of racialhate.&quot;18. In its positive aspect this racialism in the economic field is exploitedby the Reddingsdaad (Act of Redemption), This movement was founded at thetime of the Voortrekker centenary celebrations in 1938 by a Free State predikant,Dr. Kestall. In his intention it was to be a genuine attempt to combine thespiritual and economic salvation of the poor white. These objectives-have become grossly distorted in action. It was meant to be non-political but it hasbecome completely identified with the political opposition to the Government.A leader of the movement recently described its objectives in the following terms :-&quot; If we want to achieve success we must use the technique of capitalismas it is applied to the most important industry of this country, the goldmining industry. We must establish something like the finance houses ofJohannesburg.&quot;Since then a central Afrikaner finance house has been established. Its nameis the Federale Volksbeleggings (People&apos;s Investments) Limited and its aim isto get control of the Afrikaners&apos; savings and to invest them in purely Afrikanerenterprises. It has been launched with a share capital of  300,000 of which large blocks have been subscribed by an Afrikaner Life insurance company, anAfrikaner &quot; People&apos;s Bank&quot; and the Reddingsdaad organisation itself. Theinducements held out to prospective investors have been analysed as follows : Thelarge profits accruing from the venture will flow back to Afrikanerdom; theAfrikaner will become the employer of his fellow-Afrikaner and the environmentin which the Afrikaner will work will be an Afrikaner environment. Thereis no suggestion that these firms will have better conditions of work than thoseexisting in &quot;capitalist&quot; organisations; but they will employ only Afrikanerworkers a term that has come to be synonymous with the supporters of thepolitical opposition.19. In the past two years numerous shops, mainly of the clothing and.household furnishing kind, have been established with the help of Afrikanercapital concentrated in this way. But the most interesting portent of all is theestablishment in the past few weeks of an Afrikaner building society, which makesits appeal exclusively to the Afrikaans-speaking section of the community. It isclear that an Afrikaner finance capitalism is developing which is far removed from the social aims of the founder of the Reddingsdaad and may have animportant influence on the future policy of the Nationalist Party. Even nowthere are signs of conflict between the conservative financial interests, which are represented by Die Burger, of Cape Town, and the economic radicalism of someof the Transvaal Nationalists, whose mouthpiece is Die Transvaler.Separation in the Schools.20. The tragedy of race relationships in South Africa is that, so far fromthe educational system exerting a wholesome influence towards tolerance and understanding, its influence for many years has been to emphasise racialdifferences and to pander to the cry for separation between the English andAfrikaans-speaking sections. Under the pressure of Nationalist sentiment andfears that Afrikaner youth were being contaminated by contact with theirEnglish-speaking contemporaries, there has been a steady movement towards theherding of the two sections into separate &quot;single-medium &quot; schools. The secondlanguage in each one is taught merely as a school and a written &quot; subject&quot;;there is no contact between the children of the two sections in classroom or inplayground; and a perfunctory bilingualism is a matter of examinationcertificates rather than of easy and assured intercourse. It is, indeed, remarkable,that after so many years of official insistence on bilingual qualifications thestandard prevailing in the use of the second language is so low. Whereas thegeneration Of Afrikaner youth which grew up after the South African Warfound a sound knowledge of English essential for advancement in any career,except perhaps farming, the tendency is now for many Afrikaners, especially inthe platteland, to grow up with perhaps a very slight reading knowledge of the language, but with complete inability to speak it. The younger English-speakinggeneration, on the other hand, is by the very force of circumstances made moreaware of the need for proficiency in Afrikaans; but social intercourse betweenthe two sections is so difficult and rare that English-speaking children who growup in the larger towns seldom have any practice in using Afrikaans in conversation.  There is now a strong reaction on the Government side in favour&apos;
of dual-medium schools in which the children of both races would be brought together in classroom and playground and in which each language would bethe medium of instruction for half the subjects of the curriculum. The proposals is being vigorously fought by the Afrikaner opposition on the ground that itis a disguised attempt to wean Afrikaner children from their nationalist andisolationist sympathies; and it is pointed out that the private Church of Englandand British Nonconformist schools, which play so large a part in the education of English-speaking youth, would not be affected by such a change.21. As things are now, the Afrikaans-medium schools in many parts of thecountry are breeding grounds of racial hatred. Teachers make no effort to hidetheir partiality and Afrikaner supporters of the Government who happen to bein the minority in country districts make frequent complaints of the efforts whichteachers make to direct the sympathies of pupils into nationalist channels. Atelection times in particular Afrikaner teachers of Nationalist sympathies have gone to the most improper lengths of propaganda. It is significant and disturbing thatteachers are among the leaders of the Ossewa Brandwag in the platteland. a party like the United Party, which depends for its very existence on the practiceof racial co-operation, labours under many disadvantages as compared with an aggressive nationalist movement which makes its appeal frankly to only one racialgroup. An example of this is the teaching of history in the schools. In recentyears a disproportionate emphasis has come to be placed by the State schools on purely South African history; and whereas the English text-books do their best to emphasise the aspects of co-operation between the two sections and minimiseevents such as the South African war, which have left a residue of bitterness,the Afrikaans text-books see South African history of heroic strugglesagainst the British Imperialist oppressor. Well might Sir Charles Oman say(though he was not thinking of South Africa) that he cared not who made the laws of a country if he had the making of its primary school history manuals.22. Another factor which should not foe overlooked in considering theinfluence of education on the prospects of racial co-operation is the unwillingnessof young English-speaking men and women to adopt teaching as a career andthe consequent predominance of Afrikaans-speaking teachers in the profession.In the large towns English-medium Government schools have grown up under theinfluence of masters and mistresses imported by Lord Milner from Oxford and cambridge in large numbers after the South African War, and a remarkablyhigh standard of education has been attained; but after forty years&apos; service theseteachers are now retiring almost en bloc, and it is increasingly difficult to fill theirplaces even with English-speaking South African-trained teachers of a second-rate ability. Even in the big Johannesburg schools an increasingly largeproportion of the staff is coming to consist of teachers whose home language isAfrikaans; and in the English-medium country schools the English languageis now frequently taught by Afrikaans-speaking teachers with no direct or livingexperience of English culture.23. Afrikaner separatism in recent years has extended to the Boy Scouts andGirl Guides. A rival youth movement called the Voortrekkers has been started,with a similar technique to that of Lord Baden-Powell&apos;s foundation, but withvastly different objects. In this movement school teachers, perhaps inevitably,take a leading part. In art also the same tendency is apparent. Die Transvaleronly the other day complained that the galleries at Cape Town and Johannesburgdid not give enough space or prominence to the works of &quot; Afrikaner artists.&quot;One would think, this paper said, that &quot; only the British knew how to wield thepaint brush or the chisel.&quot; This accusation is untrue, as several of the bestpainters and sculptors now working in South Africa are of pure Afrikaner stock,and are represented in the public galleries.The Universities.24. The standard of South African university education, with the exceptionof the Witwatersrand and Cape Town, is low, as those graduates find who go onto English or Continental universities. The Natal Witness, in a recent leadingarticle, described the Natal university colleges as &quot; little more than glorified highschools, entry for which is within the compass of the mediocre, even the dull, andthe life of which bears more resemblance to a girls&apos; seminary than to a.-university.&quot; On the side of the Humanities, the standard appears to be steadilydeteriorating as a result of the displacement of the older professors (who camealmost invariably from the British Isles and many of whom are now reaching the[24647J ^ q
retiring age) by teachers educated solely at South African universities. TheEnglish-medium universities (Cape Town, Johannesburg and certain of theconstituent colleges of the Federal University of South Africa) do still, whenpossible, appoint to teaching posts former students who have been overseas; butthe Afrikaans-medium institutions now tend to attach little, if any, value to the possession of any overseas experience, even in Holland or in Germany; and manyof the teachers have never been out of the country. In these institutions thenationalist impulse is growing in strength. At Pretoria, for example, politicalfeeling is so intense that sons and daughters of English-speaking families of thetown, even though fluent in the use of Africaans, are deterred from attending theuniversity and have to go elsewhere.25. In a recent talk with an English-speaking member of the staff I gainedan interesting impression of the atmosphere there, and, no doubt, in the otherAfrikaans universities and colleges. He told me that the real power anddominating influence in Pretoria University was the Dutch Reformed Church.Its tame representatives on the Council and committees ruled the roost, as all others were tactfully silent for fear of the consequences social and financial. All&quot; Freedom,&quot; academic as well as political, had been suppressed by a well-organised &apos;&apos; gestapo&apos;&apos; among the staff and students which reported any&apos;&apos; unorthodox &apos;&apos; activity. . In teaching English care had to be observed inmentioning the writings of Lyall, Darwin, Huxley, Herbert Spencer or CardinalNewman. My informant told me that this censorship was inspired not so muchby political considerations in the narrow sense as by the fear of the predikantsthat they might lose their hold over the people and their determination that youngAfrikaners at the University should not become contaminated with modernliberal and free-thinking ideas. The fear of English, or even of Nederlands, wasthat knowledge of these languages might mean access to books and ideas thatwould undermine orthodox Calvinism and clerical authority. His whole accountreminded me of Spanish education and universities before the fall ofAlfonso XIII. Strenuous efforts have recently been made by the Dutch ReformedChurch in the Orange Free State to transform the University College atBloemfontein into a wholly Afrikaans institution. The irony of the situation isthat the college was founded on the initiative and with funds provided by a former High Commissioner and Governor of the Cape Colony, Sir George Grey,in the &quot; fifties &quot; of the last century. In recent years, as a result of agreementbetween the two sections, the teachings of the college has been conducted in the proportions of 60 per cent. Afrikaans to 40 per cent. English. For the time being at least that position is to be maintained; but it is unlikely that the Afrikaner,extremists will not return to the attack at some later date.26. In the relations between the English and the Afrikaans-mediumuniversities there is the same movement towards Afrikaner isolation that is evident in every aspect of the national life. Not many years ago all universityinstitutions were represented in the National Union of South African Students,which held an annual &quot; Students&apos; Parliament &quot; and performed a useful function in the education of students in the discussion of public affairs and in providingthem with a meeting-ground. Three years ago, however, the students of theAfrikaans universities broke away from the union and have now their ownNasionale Studentebond, whose leaders are in close touch with Dr. van Rensburg,the head of the Ossewa Brandwag. Because, moreover, in a recent controversyover the admission of the native students of Fort Hare to the National Union ofSouth African Students, the students of the Witwatersrand University took upa liberal attitude which was regarded by the Afrikaans universities as injurious to Afrikaner traditions, the Pretoria University openly- declared its intention tohave no further contact with its neighbour; and the annual Rugby footballmatches and inter-university debates have been cancelled avowedly for this reason.Other examples of Afrikaner isolationist tendencies are the foundation of anAfrikaner golf and country club at Johannesburg, and of a motor club as a rivalto the two existing organisations.(C) Nationalism and the War.27. In the political sphere it is clear that the war has had catastrophicconsequences. The general election of May 1938 had returned the United Partyto power with a majority of four-fifths of the House of Assembly. The&apos;co-operation of Afrikaans and English-speaking Afrikaners appeared to havebeen vindicated after five years of trial.   In the body of the United Party there
were inevitable strains and stresses; old suspicions still lingered and a first-classcrisis could still be precipitated by the failure of the Defence authorities to flythe Union Jack alongside the Union flag at a Union Day ceremony; the English-speaking section was restive under General Hertzog&apos;s exaggerated show ofdeference to the German diplomatic representatives in the matter of hostile press comment and the obstinacy with which he demonstrated his independence of britain by clinging to the Italian shipping subsidy. But about the foundations of the State system there was solid agreement. If the English-speaking sectionsuffered many pin-pricks administered not without malice, they had at least the satisfaction of hearing Mr. Pirow characterise a republic  is  1 joke and apoor joke at that,&quot; and General Hertzog pay tribute to Britain as the defenderof South Africa&apos;s freedom. Both parties to Fusion were undergoing a usefulpolitical education and discipline in the. difficult art of living together.Dr. Malan, the head of an inconsiderable and somewhat forlorn group ofmalcontents, was still upholding the principles of a purified and nostalgicnationalism; but he appeared at the moment to be content with the statusformally recognised in the Balfour Declaration and the Statute of Westminster.Republicanism, it seemed at last, was dead.28. On the 4th September, 1939, nearly a third of the United Partyfollowed General Hertzog into a new alliance with Dr. Malan, who welcomed themback as prodigals returned at last to the doctrines of isolationism andnationalism pure and undefiled. Afrikanerdom, it was jubilantly claimed, wasreunited, and General Smuts was left to run a Avar with the support of theEnglish-speaking people and backed by a minority of Afrikaans-speakingfollowers. These were henceforth to be taunted with the cry of &quot; Loyal Dutch,&quot;the name which the British had conferred on the passive population of the CapeColony during the South African War. Republicanism, so long quiescent, flamedonce more into sudden and active life. Parliaments decision in favour of war was an affront to the ingrained isolationism of the Afrikaner people, and it didviolence to the pro-German sentiment of a small but influential minority, manyof them of German stock. It is important to realise that the primary impulse inthe Afrikaner people&apos;s reaction was not so much dislike to Britain as an intenseunwillingness to get mixed up again in &quot; other people&apos;s wars.&quot; The moresophisticated took up the position that the Union was a small country, withneither the privileges nor the responsibilities of the Great Powers; in an&apos;&apos; imperialistic &apos;&apos; war between Great Powers it was the path of wisdom for smallcountries to lie low in the hope that they would be left in peace. The pre-dominance of British sea-power was still accepted as part of the natural order;and the Afrikaner nationalist saw no more reason to feel under an obligation to britain for the protection afforded by her Navy than did the Dutch colonies wholay under the more immediate threat of Japanese power in the Pacific. Even thedestruction of Dutch and Belgian neutrality aroused no qualms. It was themisfortune of those countries that they lay in the path of the German advance.South Africa, 6,000 miles from the centre of conflict, was not necessarily in danger; and the continued (if temporary) immunity of the Union in the face ofthe Japanese menace has merely confirmed the Nationalists in their belief in the praticability of isolation.Anti-British Feeling.29. If, however, isolationism of the French-Canadian type was the primeingredient of the Afrikaner&apos;s attitude at the time, it was inevitable that theUnion&apos;s participation in the war would result in the re-awakening and intensi-fication, of anti-British feeling. For, the argument went, although the wardecision was constitutional enough, it was not&quot; free,&quot; since at least the English-speaking members who voted for it were so influenced by their feelings for britain in danger that they were incapable of looking at the issue from thenarrowly South African point of view. Had not Mr. B. K. Long himselfadmitted as much when in the war debate he begged Afrikaner members tounderstand the deeply-rooted feelings which moved their English-speaking fellow-South Africans? It was clear that until the last ties which bound-the union to Great Britain were severed the greater part of the English-speaking-population would always throw their influence on the side of intervention infuture wars in. which Britain might be involved. The remedy was to cut the lastremaining ties that bound the Union to the British Commonwealth of Nations,for until that was done and formal republican independence established, theUnion&apos;s freedom in external affairs would exist merely on paper.[24647] c 2
30.   The outbreak of war raised once again, and brought into the veryforefront of the political conflict, the whole issue of the relationship between theUnion and Great Britain.   In peacetime that issue had seemed satisfactorilysettled; now no amount of sophistry about a vital South African interest being at stake in a &quot;war for Poland&quot; could disguise the fact that South Africawas in the war simply &quot;and as an inevitable consequence of Britain&apos;s ownparticipation.   General Smuts, &quot; the greatest Imperialist of our time,&quot; as an english newspaper had called him, had dragged South Africa into the war against Germany in the British interest; and the Afrikaner, grown cynical inan age of power politics, was unmoved by moral arguments.   British foreignpolicy in the immediate pre-war years since the famous Hoare-Laval incident,had done little to enlist the support of moral sentiment in the world at large;and Afrikaners could perhaps be forgiven when they found malicious pleasurein stripping it of its moral claims and exposing the bare bones of economic andinsular self-interest.   Moreover, a people still assiduous in cultivating a picture of themselves as martyrs to the British lust for empire, were left indifferent bythe argument that the Germans were (in their turn) out for world domination.The majority might feel at the back of their minds that the best interests oftheir country lay in a British victory; but this was a merely fortuitous coincidenceof interest and the negligible contribution which the Union might be able tomake towards this consummation would be overbalanced by the loss and sufferingto herself.31. The tragedy is that this feeling of aloofness from the overriding worldissues of the time was in no way counteracted by any consciousness of solidaritywith a threatened civilisation. At a time when the world was groping towards a greater degree of integration, and economic necessity was calling for theformation of larger political units, the Afrikaner people were absorbed in aromantic nationalism that was the best part of a hundred years behind the times.They have been plunged against their will into a war with which they stillprofess to have no concern and on behalf (as they believe) of an Empire withwhich they have no longer any wish to be associated. The resulting emotionsof irritation and frustration have given the main impulse to the presentrepublican agitation which is now the major content of Opposition political activity.(D) &quot;The Political Opposition.32. It is now generally accepted that of&apos; the total Afrikaans-speakingpopulation of about 1,300,000 no less than 700,000 may be counted as supporters of Dr. Malan and the Nationalist Party, 300,000 are members of the ossewa brandwag, adherents of Mr. Pirow or followers of the smallest and leastirreconcilable group led by Mr. Havenga. The remaining 300,000 supportGeneral Smuts. Added as they are to the 950,000 members of the English-speaking population they give the Government a majority against the combinedopposition groups. It is evident, of course, that these figures are nothing morethan a rough estimate; and they include not only the politically effectivemembers of the population but children who are classified according to thepolitical allegiance of their parents. They are, however, a guide to within,say, a hundred &quot;thousand, of the relative proportions of the political groups.33. The Nationalist Party of to-day justifiably enough claims to be therepository of the nationalist tradition as founded by General Hertzog in thestruggle against &quot; Milnerism,&quot; and developed by him in the Nationalistadministrations which held office from 1924 to 1933. Nationalists maintain thatin the years of Fusion when General Ilertzog fell prey to the seduction of reconciliation, it was they who maintained the principles of Afrikanernationalism undefiled; and when at last the outbreak of the war demonstrated theessential instability of the alliance between the two sections, General Ffertzog&apos; return to the Nationalist fold was a vindication of the attitude which Dr. Malanhad upheld during the period of that unhappy &quot; experiment.&quot; The republicwhich the Nationalist Party now so ardently desire is ostensibly modelled on theBoer republics which lost their independence at the Peace of Vereeniging; withthe difference, however, that, whereas the Transvaal republic had only a minority of uitlanders at Johannesburg to contend with and the Orange Free State hadhardly any at all, the new South African republic would incorporate the English-speaking population of the former British colony of Natal and the large English-speaking population of the Cape Province, as well as the Rand with an
English-speaking population vastly greater than that which so sorely troubled thepeace of mind of President Kruger. Its republic, nevertheless, would be anAfrikaner republic in the most exclusive sense; it would be the Afrikanerfolk-myth now so sedulously cultivated that would determine its character and direction; and the State would be formally based on a Christianity bounded bythe Calvinist doctrines of the Dutch Reformed Church. In such a society therewould be no basis for the equal co-operation of Boer and Briton. Vague promiseshave been made to protect the cultural rights of the English-speaking population;but political rights would be extended only to Afrikaners and those members ofthe English-speaking population who had proved by word and deed that their whole allegiance was given, to the republican ideal. The Jews &quot;and otherun-national elements &quot; would not be admitted to citizenship. The colour line between whites and blacks would be most strongly reinforced and upheld; andthe colour bar would be extended to every field of employment where Europeanswere now meeting the competition of unskilled natives.The Malanite Programme.34. The Malanite programme for the attainment of a republic has under-gone significant changes during the course of the war. After the fall of Franceand the retreat from Dunkirk, when it appeared even to observers -less biassedthan the Nationalist Party that only a miracle could save Britain from defeat,Dr. Malan made frantic efforts to disassociate South Africa from a Powerapparently going down in ruin. The &apos;&apos; peace petition &apos;&apos; was set on foot,demanding the withdrawal of the Union from the war; and the nationalist party gave many evidences of its sympathy with Germany, including a wiliing-ness to sacrifice the democratic traditions of the Afrikaner people in favour ofan authoritarian regime clearly modelled on that of Germany. At that timeDr. Malan hoped that, the Ossewa Brandwag, as the &quot; action front &quot; of Afrikanernationalism, would submit itself to his control; but it soon became clear that dr. van Rensburg wanted a career of his own and was in no mind to make hisorganisation an appendage of a political party. Moreover, he was in sympathy with Mr. Pirow&apos;s dissident elements in the Nationalist Party, who were beginning the active propagation of the National Socialist doctrine unhamperedby nostalgic retrospection towards the idyllic past of the Boer republics. Itwas not long before Dr. van Rensburg and Mr. Pirow, as unacknowledged allies,were engaged in strenuous competition with Dr. Malan for the favour of the prospective German victor. Gradually it became apparent to Dr. Malan thata parliamentary party which relied largely upon the support of the DutchReformed Church and claimed to be the. sole exponent of the &quot;Afrikanertradition &apos;&apos; was no match for his rivals - when it came to demonstrating hispassion for the National Socialist ideal. Moreover, Britain was not dead after all, and indeed, showed a disturbing capacity of resiliency; and American helpwas beginning to be effective. The Nationalist leaders recovered their confidencesin the mission and usefulness of a party committed to seeking its objects throughparliamentary methods; they emphasised the achievements of the old. nationalist party under General Hertzog and began their vigorous campaign to force theOssewa Brandwag into subjection and Mr. Pirow into the narrow bounds of party discipline. Dr. Malan was confirmed in his return to the democraticpath by the exasperating partiality which the German broadcasting station atZeesen displayed for the Ossewa Brandwag. Its broadcasts were being followedby increasing numbers of Afrikaners and the bitter attacks which they deliveredon the Nationalist leaders did much to destroy the illusion that their interestslay in a German victory.&apos; 35. The present policy and expectations of the Nationalist Party were clearly stated in a recent speech by Mr. Eric Lonw, who. is Dr. Malan&apos;s chieflieutenant in the Cape Province and the rival to Mr. Strydom, the Transvaalleader, for ultimate succession to Dr. Malan. The war, he said, had three possibleissues.&apos; The most probable was a German victory. General Smuts would be compelled by the failure of his policy to hand over power to the parliamentary opposition and the Nationalist Party, through Dr. Malan, would conduct negotiations with Germany. Hitler would realise that he would have tonegotiate with the party which represented the overwhelming majority of nationalist-minded Afrikaners. He would not negotiate with a mere minoritysuch as the Ossewa Brandwag and Mr. Pirow, (Mr. Louw did not say that this lineof reasoning had been prompted by the experience of Roumania, where hitler had raised, not the Iron Guard, but General Antonescu to power.)
36. In the event of a stalemate, Mr. Louw continued, British prestige inthe world would be finally destroyed and a necessary consequence, would be the disintegration of the British Empire. South Africa would certainly be power-fully affected by the general disillusionment and the Nationalist Party wouldin this case also come to power and be in a position to sever all connections with the British Commonwealth. If, however, present expectations werefalsified and Britain and the United States emerged as victors, the nationalist party would continue its struggle for republican independence as it had afterthe last war and on lines similar to those pursued with such&apos; success byMr. de Valera in Eire. In the event either of a British victory ora stalemate, Mr. Louw said, the Ossewa Brandwag and the new order movement would disappear from the scene. These groups were notequipped to fight British &quot;Jingoism&quot; or General Smuts. They were sittingand waiting for a republic to be presented to them on a platter by Germany.They hoped that they would be the new rulers of South Africa, but even thenDr. van Rensburg and Mr. Pirow would have to settle the question as to which of them would be in actual command.The Nationalists and Democracy.37. Among the leaders of the Nationalist Party it is Mr. Strydom who hasbeen most active in confirming the party in a parliamentary democratic out lookand in persuading it that its future can lie only in the development and modernisation of the- democratic principles inherent in the system of the Boerrepublics. In an able speech to the Nationalist Youth Congress at Pretoria earlyin August he insisted that it was this system, modified and improved to meet theneeds of a new- age, upon which the new South African republic would have tobe based. &quot; This republic must be guaranteed against interference from outside and against hostile and un-national elements from within; it must be made safefor white, Christian civilisation; and set free from the bonds of the capitalistmoney-power and parasitical exploitation.&quot; He proceeded to criticise Dr. vanRensburg and his friends, who were spreading a false conception of South Africanhistory. They had not the courage to attack the republican ideal, but, instead,put forward the idea of a &quot; sham republic,&quot; while all the time they were strivingfor the establishment of a National Socialist dictatorship. Paul Kruger had beena great democrat and had always shown the utmost solicitude for the authorityof the Volksraad. Democracy, indeed, was part of the very nature of theAfrikaner people and was enshrined in their past. At the same time it shouldbe emphasised that there were as many branches of democracy as there were sectsin the Protestant Church; and the Afrikaner conception of democracy differedjust as much from other conceptions as Calvinism differed from Methodism. ThusBoer democracy was quite a different thing from the &quot; British-Jewish &quot; democracy.38. In a recent speech at Johannesburg, Dr. Malan took the curious andtreasonable course of appealing to Hitler for an indication of his &quot; intentionswith regard to South Africa, just as Japan had declared her intentions withregard to India.&quot; Some weeks later, in the Zeesen Afrikaans transmission,appeared a reference which he claimed to be the desired confirmation of his statement that Germany had no wish to interfere in the internal affairs of theUnion, and that the Nationalist Party would be permitted to proceed unmolestedwith its task of building up the Christian-National republic. This claim is, tosay the least, disingenuous and not borne out by the text of the broadcast.Zeesen, indeed, took pains to point out that, while it had the highest regard forthe achievements of the old Nationalist Party, it was not prepared to regardDr. Malan&apos;s faction, which had lost the support of both General Hertzog andMr. Pirow, with their respective followers, as anything more than the negligiblerump of that party. It then declared that Germany had no wish to dictate theform of government which South Africa should adopt so long as South Africaceased to be governed in the interests of a foreign power and was truly Afrikaans.Dependence on a German Victory.39. Dr. van Rensburg, Commandant-General of the Ossewa Brandwag,promptly demonstrated the naivete of Dr. Malan&apos;s claims. In the struggle against General Smuts, he said, Germany was on the side of those national-minded organisations which were out to discipline the people and secure nationalsolidarity and not on the side of politicians who sought personal and partyadvantage even at the cost of unity. He then stated roundly that, so far as theOssewa Brandwag was concerned, there was no doubt that the emancipation ofthe Afrikaner people from the British yoke was entirely dependent on a Germanvictory.
40. In the period immediately after the outbreak of war, when attemptswere made not without some prospects of success to secure the co-operation of theNationalist Party and the Ossewa Brandwag, there was a tendency for the differences of outlook and aim between these rival organisations to be deliberatelyobscured. Now, however, the Nationalist Party is engaged in a war of extermina-tion against the Ossewa Brandwag with the object of establishing itself as the sole representative of national-minded Afrikanerdom in the political sphere;and the struggle has forced both sides to clarify and systematise their attitudeson- the questions at issue. Thus, while the Nationalist Party is striving after a republic independent of any outside Power and democratic in the sense that itwould cling to some semblance of the Parliamentary system, the Ossewa Brandwagis frankly out to establish an authoritarian State &quot;under the a^aegis of Germany. Ina manifesto issued in April 1942 it declared the Boer nation (in the Nazi jargon)to be &quot;an organised ethical idea.&quot; For the sake of a strong national Govern-ment, it continued, liberal and democratic ideas would be eliminated and aclosely-knit and disciplined nation built up. Organised money-power would be rendered powerless by the nationalisation of key industries, the banks and themeans of propaganda. Emphasis would be laid on the health and welfare ofAfrikaner families, &quot; as carriers of Afrikaner blood,&quot; and not on rich joint-stockcompanies which exploited the nation.41. Despite the obvious inspiration which it draws from Germany, theOssewa Brandwag is not formally committed to the National Socialist doctrine.Dr. van Rensburg himself is an adherent of it but he has not tried as yet to force itupon the rank and file of his movement. The chief exponent of national socialismin South Africa is Mr. Pirow, who founded the New Order movement to propa-gate it. He has done his best to sever the inevitable connexion in people&apos;s mindsbetween national socialism and Germany by declaring that every country should adopt a form of the doctrine specially suited to its needs and traditions, andincurred some ridicule by declaring that if his own brand of national socialismowed anything to foreign inspiration, it was to Dr. Salazar rather than to Hitlerthat he was indebted. He has always denied that his New Order was only apolitical movement; and recently announced that every member of his movementmust also necessarily be a faithful member of the Ossewa Brandwag. he expressed the hope that in time every member of the Ossewa Brandwag wouldbe a &quot; National Socialist.&quot; His tactics are clearly designed in time to place him in a position from which he will be able to challenge Dr. Van Rensburg for the leadership of the pro-German forces in the country. But Mr. Pirow&apos;s personalfollowing is negligible in numbers; and his importance (such as it is) springs fromhis influence on German elements in the population and a group of youngAfrikaner &quot; intellectuals&quot; and the personal vigour and ambition of the cleverlawyer of pure German stock which may once again bring him into the forefrontof the political conflict.Ossewa Brandwag in Decline.42. The Ossewa Brandwag, which in the early period of the war looked asif it would displace the Nationalist Party as the principal opponent of theGovernment, is now rapidly on the decline. For this many factors are responsible.Its hopes of an early German victory have been too often disappointed and, like a spring which has been kept wound, up too long, it has lost its tension.Dr. van Rensburg has failed as a leader. He is not a man of action but an&quot; intellectual,&quot; and as a former Secretary for Justice he is only too clearly aware of the dangers of precipitate and violent action. At the same time he has notbeen able to restrain the young hot-heads among his followers who crave excite-ment; and the consequent amateurish and inefficient attempts at sabotage bydynamite, which a series of court cases has laid at the door of the ossewa brandwag, has provoked a revulsion of feeling among the Afrikanerpopulation of the platteland. Nothing but a martyr&apos;s crown can now raise hisprestige as a leader among his own people; but this continues to be denied him byan incredibly long-suffering Government whose tolerance, it must be admitted,has in this respect at least been amply justified. Most important of all, theNationalist Party&apos;s campaign, which has been conducted with great skill and nolittle cunning, has attracted many thousands of Ossewa Brandwag members backto the party fold; and many thousands more, confronted by the necessityof choosing between the two organisations, have decided to remain faithful tothe Nationalist Party as the repository of Afrikaner traditions and to renouncea movement which, in their eyes, seeks to substitute German intervention forBritish &quot; influence.&quot;&apos;
43. So much for the various factions of the Afrikaner republican opposition.I should not close this section of my despatch without at least a perfunctorymention of the now exiguous Afrikaner Party-that child of misfortune which isrenounced even by General Hertzog, whom it followed with such eager filial pietyinto the political wilderness. This group was at first much nearer to theGovernment side than to the quarrelling factions of the Opposition. Itsrepublicanism was of the theoretical kind which insists that a prime condition for the establishment of a republic must be the consent of the majority of theEnglish-speaking section. It still stands nominally on the principle of racialco-operation and will have nothing to do with any constitution which denies thefull and equal rights of the English-speaking population. Its only quarrel withthe Government appeared to be*the Union&apos;s participation in the war which itstill affects to believe could have been avoided; but in its opposition insideParliament it has been so moderate and so studious not to embarrass theGovernment that its extra-Parliamentary leader, Mr. Havenga, is still talkedabout by the English-speaking people as a possible Prime Minister when thewar is over; and his candidature may wrell receive the support of the gold mining-interest. On the other hand the rift between these old &quot; Hertzogites &quot; and dr. Malan is so deep that if their few members of Parliament had to choose between Dr. Malan and Mr. Pirow they would, like General Hertzog himself,throw in their lot with Mr. Pirow. As a third &quot; Opposition&quot; party they area steadily dwindling force in the country.(E) The English-Speaking Population.44. Previous sections of this despatch have dealt almost exclusively with theAfrikaans-speaking section of the South African population. It would perhaps be convenient at this stage to give some account of the positionoccupied in the community by the English-speaking people who make upabout 42 per cent, of the Union&apos;s white population. The census of last yeardisclosed a,total of 950,000 English-speaking people (including 100,000 Jews)as against 1,300,000 Afrikaners. Unlike the other Dominions, South Africa hasnot had the advantage of a steady and considerable flow of British immigrants.Immigration was, it is true, greatly stimulated for short periods by the discoveryfirst of diamonds and then of gold in the seventies and eighties of last century.In the years immediately succeeding the South African War many thousandsentered the country; but for several years afterwards a commercial depressionintervened which actually resulted in a net loss of European population. From1910 and. again from 1918 onwards the inward flow of British immigrants andothers was resumed, only to be checked once more Jby the onset of an economicdepression. In 1924 the new restrictions placed upon immigration by the UnitedStates and other countries which had formerly received a large influx of popula-tion diverted a considerable stream of immigrants from Eastern, Central and southern Europe to the Union. In 1930 General Hertzog&apos;s Government, alarmedby the growing influx of Jews from Eastern Europe, secured the passage through parliament of the Immigration Quota Act, which was effective in reducing the flow; but it is significant that in the ten years 1926-36 the Jewish population ofthe Union increased by no less than 12 per cent.45. In the four years before the present war never more than 5,000 Britishsubjects entered the Union and the average net gain was about 3,200; and, it is interesting to note that the persons born in the Union now amount to seven-eightsof the total European population as against three-quarters in 1904. Of the&quot; extra-born &quot; Europeans 70 per cent, have come from the United Kingdom orother British territories. But clearly if the tendencies of the pre-war years persistBritish immigrants will do little to redress the balance of population which formany years past has been going steadily against the English-speaking section.Unfortunately it is only in the past five years that the census has tried to estimate the respective proportions in the European population of English and Afrikaans-speaking people; but it is everywhere admitted, that whereas at the turn of thecentury the two sections were very nearly equal in numbers, the higher Afrikaner&apos;birth rate has given the Afrikaans-speaking section a growing preponderance.Even if this were not a matter of common observation it could be deduced fromthe general rule that a relatively backward rural population has a higher rateof increase than the more progressive population of the towns; and in the SouthAfrican rural areas no less than 85 per cent, of the population is Afrikaans-speaking. Even in the towns, where the proportions are 54 per cent. English-speaking as against 42 per cent. Afrikaans-speaking, the latter, forming as they
do the main bulk of the poorer class, tend to be more prolific than their English-speaking neighbours. Nothing less, indeed, than a considerable influx of immigrants from Great Britain can hope to redress the balance; and in thisconnection it cannot be too strongly emphasised that for land settlement or *schemes of the kind tried after the last war there is simply no future at all. Any /considerable immigration must be based on the development of base metals 1and of manufactures. It is perhaps enough for the purposes of the present jdespatch to say that these prospects are not unfavourable: indeed, were thisotherwise there would be no more promising future for South Africa once thegold mining industry had declined than that of a poor and backward agriculturaleconomy. If this condition can be fulfilled there seems little doubt that therewould be many thousands of young Britons who would avail themselves ofopenings in South Africa in secondary industry. Convoys have taken hundreds of thousands of British troops through South African ports daring the present war; and their hosts have been powerfully struck by their enthusiasm for thecountry and the apparently widespread desire to settle here after the war. Manyyoung Royal Air Force artisans now in South Africa in the joint air-training scheme hope to be demobilised and to take up civil employment here at theconclusion of hostilities. The other side of this picture, of course, is the bitteropposition which the Afrikaners would raise to any large-scale immigrationwhich might threaten their political domination; even now Nationalist news-papers are full of suggestions that the Government has on foot a plot to &apos;&apos; ploughAfrikaners under&quot; by means of State-aided immigration from Britain afterthe war.Race &quot; Segregation.&quot;46. Nearly the whole of the English-speaking population is concentrated iiifour areas. These are (1) the Witwatersrand, which now contains just over one-fifth of the total European population; (2) Natal, with a population of141,000 English-speaking and only 38,000 Afrikaans-speaking people; (3) the cape Peninsula, where an overwhelmingly English-speaking community is cutoff from the cities of the interior and the south-east coast by the Nationaliststronghold of the Western Cape Province; and (4) the Eastern Province of the cape, where the towns of Port Elizabeth, East London, Grahamstown and KingWilliams Town are the centre of an English-speaking population descended in very large measure from the 1820 Settlers. In these areas, with the partialexception of the Witwatersrand, English-speaking communities live a life almost completely segregated from their Afrikaner fellow-countrymen. Here one maylive for years and hear hardly a word of Afrikaans spoken. Many families ofAfrikaner descent have been so well assimilated that they are almost &quot;moreEnglish than the English &apos;&apos;; and social contacts between members of the two sections are almost non-existent. To drive forty miles from Cape Town to Paarl,for example, is to enter a different world, where Afrikaans culture prevails and english exists only on sufferance. Further inland, in the open spaces of theKarroo, are villages in which many inhabitants would not be able to understand the simplest English sentence. Even on the Witwatersrand, where thousands of Afrikaner youths from the platteland have taken the places of the english and Cornish miners and where &apos;&apos; poor whites &apos;&apos; driven by economic circumstancesfrom the land have found a refuge, there is little mixing between the two sectionsof the people. The prosperous northern suburbs of Johannesburg are inhabitedalmost entirely by the English-speaking mining magnates, professional and business families, and by a small minority of Afrikaans-speaking lawyers anddoctors; the slums of Vrededorp and Mayfair are just at predominantlyAfrikaans; in between, in the less fashionable suburbs and the mining towns thatstretch from Springs to Randfontein, Afrikaans and English-speaking familiesmay live side by&apos;side in the same streets, but contacts are of the most perfunctory.If only because of the language barrier people tend to make their friends among members of the same language group. Such inter-marrying as there is isinfrequent enough to cause comment. Instead of an .equal union of cultures,these marriages usually tend to the absorption of one partner into the cultureof the other; and contrary as this may seem to the superficial expectation, they arenegligible as a factor making for understanding between the two sections.47. The English-speaking people in South Africa are predominantly a middle-class community, comfortably circumstanced and easy-going. Life ismade smooth for them by an equable and sunny climate, and&apos;by an abundanceof native domestic servants. Nurtured for the most part in the years when Britishf24647]D
pre-eminence in the world was regarded almost as part of the natural order, theyhave the self-confidence which springs from a belief in the inherent superiority ofthe British race. Their demeanour in the years immediately after the SouthAfrican War did much to aggravate in the mind of the Afrikaner the feeling ofinferiority and the urge towards self-vindication that are the psychological rootsof Afrikaner nationalism. It is the measure of their failure that, as the repre-sentatives of a world-wide culture and supported as they were by the prestige of the greatest empire known to history, they have failed to win the Afrikanerto the British way of life. Burke once said that little minds and a great empirego ill together. The English-speaking people in South Africa, in the years afterthe Boer War, were &quot; top-dog &quot; and they failed in magnanimity. &quot; Dutch &quot; and&quot; Afrikaner &quot; on their lips were terms of reproach; England was still &quot; Home,&quot;even to those whose parents and grandparents had been born in South Africa. ToAfrikaners who, as a result of historical circumstance and a deliberate act ofwill, had cut themselves off from the countries of their ancestors, the flauntingof a British loyalty (accompanied as it often was by open contempt for SouthAfrica) was an unforgivable affront.The Financial and Economic Field.48. One of the most significant features of the social structure is the extentto which the English-speaking people dominate the financial and economic field.Jews are predominant in the smaller retail trade in the towns, and in the SouthAfrican equivalents of Wool worths and Marks and Spencer. They make up themajority of country storekeepers. They have also a powerful position in the clothing manufacturing industry (which has made rapid strides in recent years).and in some&quot; smaller manufactures. But it is South Africans of British descentwho for the most part control the large concentrations of financial power, mostnotable of which are the gold mining houses, and the finance and trust companies.They also control the insurance companies and commercial agencies. Among theleaders of the gold mining industry such names as John Martin, Anderson,Carleton Jones and Beatty predominate. Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, a Jew, and dr. Hans Pirow, a South African of German descent, are very much exceptionsin this field. The local management of the two great commercial banks was until recently entirely in the hands of English-speaking South Africans; the appoint-ment of Mr. van der Merwe to the General Managership of Barclays Bank ayear or so ago was the subject of surprised comment. The great department storesare in the hands of British families like Stuttaford, Thorne, Garlick and Orr.Here again the election of Mr. van der Horst as Chairman of the board ofFletcher&apos;s at Cape Town was hailed everywhere as proof that Afrikaners could make good in business; but the comment it occasioned was itself an indication ofthe infrequency of such an appointment.49. If the English-speaking people predominate in the economic sphere theyrare drifting progressively into the position of a racial minority in politics, and are beginning to show the special psychological traits which are fostered by. such a/situation. They are, of course, handicapped in the struggle by inferiority of numbers; but they seem handicapped, too, by a lack of that political ambition andtalent which has given the English Parliamentary system its pre-eminence amongsystems of government. The trouble is partly, of course, that the very success ofthe English-speaking South African in other fields of activity makes him loth toendure the hazards and personal struggles of a political career; with the resultthat the great majority of English-speaking members of the House of Assembly;are of the kind who have been no great success in business life. Except for asprinkling of lawyers, they are mostly poorly educated; and they are lacking inleadership and time-serving in political behaviour. In England, Mr. Lytteftontakes naturally to politics and brings his experience of industry to the service ofthe State. In South Africa, on the other hand, his equivalent, Mr. John Martin,prefers to exercise from without the political influence which accompanies thelarge concentration of economic power in the gold-mining industry. The result is that the standing of Parliament, deprived as it is of significant figures from industry and commerce, inevitably suffers. There are, of course, other reasons why more young English-speaking South Africans are not recruited into politics.The most important is that, unless a political aspirant is,either a lawyer or afarmer, he cannot afford the long periods of absence from his business. Anotheris the growing and dictatorial power of the party machine, which has recentlytended to discourage men of ability and independence from entering Parliament.The back benches in the present House of Assembly are lamentably deficient inxjotential ministers.
Lack of Political Leaders.50. It is a regrettable fact that since Union the English-speaking people&apos; have not contributed a single leader of the first rank to the political life of thecountry as they did in the old days of the Cape Parliament. They have had to goto Afrikaners for their leaders. First General-Botha, then General Smuts hashad their allegiance. Now the question which overshadows the political life ofthe country is the identity of General Smuts&apos;s successor. Mr. Hofmeyr looked as.if he might secure the support of the English-speaking population; that prospect,however, is receding, and Dr. Steyn, at any rate in Natal, appears now to be thefavourite,&apos;while Mr. Havenga, with the support of the mining interests, is (as I ,have said above) by no means yet out of the running. There is not an English-speaking politician who can claim to be the representative of his section of the Ipeople as a whole, far less one, who can aspire to the Premiership. Is it any \wonder that the English-speaking people have made so little contribution in thepast to the development of a specific South African patriotism, or that, havingfailed to produce the political leaders who could represent their attitudes and aspirations, they have been able to do so little to mitigate the extremes of Afrikanernationalism? In the fundamental question of the union&apos;s relationship with theBritish Commonwealth of Nations it has been left to General Smuts to raise theissue to the plane of philosophic statesmanship. Colonel Stallard, on the otherhand, has done much harm to the cause of Commonwealth unity and repelled theAfrikaners by his constitutional pedantry, his old-fashioned Imperialist out lookand his lack of interest in progressive social reform. It is one of the tragediesof the present situation that no English-speaking leader has had the capacity tobring a healthy South Afrcan nationalism and loyalty to the Commonwealth idealtogether in a satisfactory synthesis.51. It would be a mistake, however, to leave the picture that I have paintedunillumined by any ray of hope. While the &quot; uitlander &quot; mentality still persiststo a surprising degree among the wealthier sections of the English-speakingpopulation, who mould their manners and ideas on those of the English uppermiddle-class, the younger generation in the early years of manhood give manyevidences of a needed South African patriotism and a willingness to meet theirAfrikaner fellow-countrymen half-way. Many of them realise that it is time thattheir people took a fuller share in the political life of the country and that Britishculture and traditions still have a fruitful contribution to make to a specificallySouth African &quot; way of life.&quot; Much depends on the willingness of young men,and still more of their parents of British stock born in South Africa, to shoulderthe hazards and responsibilities of public service, and to regard parliamentarylife as one of the highest forms of service to the community.52. I cannot close this section without a special reference to the Jewish vote.South African Jewry is almost solidly Zionist and has been one of the financialmainstays of the Palestine experiment, in support of which it is - completely&quot;organised.&quot; It is behind General Smuts largely because of his continuous and active support of the Jewish cause in Palestine. The Malcolm MacDonald white paper just before the war and its endorsement by the British House of Commonscame as .a bitter blow to South African Jewry, which to this day remainssuspicious of what it describes as the pro-Arab policy of the British ForeignOffice. A recent factor has been the prominence of South African Jews in move-ments such as &quot; Medical aid for Russia,&quot; the &quot; Friends of the Soviet Union,&quot; andthe public agitation for a second front in Western Europe. The small Communistgroups in Johannesburg and Cape Town are largely dominated and organised byJews. Jewish political activity is now largely inspired by concern about the anti-Semitic attitude of the Opposition groups; and South African Jewry is very much&apos;on the defensive.(F) The Immediate Political Conflict.53.. In,the preceding sections I have attempted to sketch, in the backgroundand perspective against which the political conflict in the Union should be set..As the present Parliament nears the end,of its-statutory life this conflict growsin intensity. A-general election is due to be held next year and matters of theutmost significance hang upon its, result. In the paragraphs that follow I proposeto give an account of the factors that may be expected to have a bearing on theissue.54. The final decision as to whether or not the election will be held withinthe period prescribed by the Act of Union is still to be taken.   A decision to[24647] &apos; d 2
postpone it will have to be validated by an Act passed through Parliament at its next session in January; so that General Smuts will not have to make up his mind until then. It is certain that he will not go to the country next year unless he is reasonably sure of a successful result : the 1924 elections which brought the nationalists to power were a lesson in the unwisdom of precipitate action. Atthe same time there are urgent reasons why the general election should not be postponed longer than is absolutely necessary. The country is growing rapidlyweary of the present Cabinet; but no adequate reconstruction of it is possibleuntil the new men worthy of Cabinet rank are brought into Parliament. TheOpposition groups are now absorbed in intensive feuds and the prospects of reconciliation seem farther away than ever; but it is the fear of United Partyofficials, apparently not altogether unfounded in a country of such vicissitudes in politics, that some major error of the Government may yet drive them into apatched-up unity. On the other hand, if the decline of the Ossewa Brandwagproceeds at its present pace for any considerable time, the Nationalists will have so grown in power at its expense that they may in fact embody in their ownranks the much-talked-of unity of Afrikanerdom; and the Government will be faced at the polls, not by two (or even more) mutually contending groups, butby a Nationalist Party much stronger than it is at this moment. Finally, and mostimportant of all, it is essential that the elections be held and a strong Governmentbe given a five years&apos; lease of power before the inevitable backwash of the post-war years threatens to engulf the United Party and. the forces represented byGeneral Smuts.55. Such are the considerations which may prompt General Smuts to decide,if that is at all practicable, upon a general election in the first half of next year.The Delimitation Commission is now busily engaged, and half its work is finished.If the voters&apos; roll based upon the new delimitation can be completed in time, it isthe aim of United Party organisers to press for an election before the middle ofthe year and before political prospects can be influenced by the hazards of warin the European summer.56. The following table gives a picture of the state of parties and groups in the House of Assembly (a) after the formation of General Smuts&apos; Governmentin September 1939; and (b) in August 1942 :  September August1939. 1942.A.

The only member to change sides isMr. Quinlan, of Germiston, who was also the only English-speaking member tofollow General Hertzog in his secession from the United Party. Within theGovernment coalition one member of the Dominion Party has gone over to theUnited Party. In the Parliamentary by-elections at Newcastle and Riversdalethe United Party and the Nationalists respectively retained the seats; and in aseries of provincial Council elections held last April the rigidity of presentdivisions was once again strikingly demonstrated.* Gain of two made up by secession of Mr. Shearer from Dominion Party and Mr. Quinlanfrom Afrikaner Party.j Mr. Quinlan, the tenth member of the party, went over to the United Party in the 1942--session.8671*8436617(Formed March1941)9t(Formed January1941)
&quot; The Drift to the Towns.&quot;58. The next general election, however, will be fought on the basis of thenew delimitation of constituencies which is now in progress. The function ofthis re-delimitation is to reflect in the electoral sphere movements of population from one area to another and is based on the data obtained from the quinquennialcensus. For more than twenty years &quot; the drift to the towns &quot; has been one ofthe most significant developments in South African life; this tendency has been-accelerated by the rapid growth of the gold mines and other industries since1932 which has drawn many thousands of Afrikaans from the platteland to theWitwatersrand and the other cities. Between the years 1931 and 1936 theEuropean population of the Witwatersrand increased by no less than one-third and an equal increase has taken place since then. Other urban areas which haveshown considerable gains in population are Pretoria, Vereeniging and Durban;but there is hardly a part of the country where the country districts are not losingpopulation to the towns. The Delimitation Commission which is now at work has decided to allocate the 150 seats of the House of Assembly (the three nativeconstituencies of the Cape Province are, of course, not taken into account) betweenthe four provinces as follows : Transvaal 64; Cape 56; Orange Free State 14;and, Natal 16. This means that the Transvaal will gain four seats, three at theexpense of the rural areas of the Cape and one at the expense of the Free State;there will be no change in Natal&apos;s representation. But within the Transvaalitself the towns will make considerable gains at the expense of the platteland.The Witwatersrand will not only receive the four seats taken from the other provinces but it will obtain two from the rural areas as well. Its total will be32 instead of 26 at present. Pretoria will increase its representation fromsix to seven seats. If Vereeniging and Losberg, two urban constituencies closely linked with the Witwatersrand, are included in the latter, the result is that the urban areas of the Trans.. \l will have no less than 41 seats as against the 23held by the Transvaal platteiand, and that the Witwatersrand alone will have as many seats as the whole of the Transvaal and Free State rural areas combined.59. The founders of the Union had expressly safeguarded the position ofthe platteland against the towns by authorising the Delimitation Commission toreduce the size of rural constituencies by 15 per cent, below the numerical averageand to increase the size of urban constituencies by the same proportion. while no commission went to the limit of this discrimination, a situation existed beforethe present commission began its work in which the incidence of the &quot; load &quot;upon the towns, aggravated by the drift away from the platteland, made it possible for some rural constituencies to have only 4,500 voters as against morethan 10,000 in some Witwatersrand divisions. That situation is obviously,intolerable, and it is being drastically corrected by the present commission, whichhas allowed for a differentiation in favour of the countryside of never more than10 per cent.60. The consternation of the Nationalist Party newspapers is the measureof the revolution which is being wrought by this shift in the balance of politicalpower from the countryside to the towns. Die Volksblad of Bloemfontein, forexample, calls it a &quot; political tragedy.&quot; The Nationalist stronghold of the orange Free State, which had so often since Union taken the lead in great issues of national significance and had, indeed, produced General Hertzog, theirgreatest leader, would now have two or three seats less than the city ofJohannesburg alone (without the Witwatersrand); and Die Transvaler hasuttered a similar lamentation over the reduced power of the Transvaal platteland.Dr. Malan has solemnly warned his followers that it is on the Witwatersrandthat the Nationalist struggle will be lost or won; and just as the Dutch ReformedChurch is now actively engaged in rounding up its &quot; wandering sheep &quot;on theWitwatersrand, so, too, is the Nationalist Party assiduous in trying to Confirmin the large Afrikaner population of this area the consciousness of their racial&quot; separateness.&quot;Witwatersrand holds the Balance.61. The special importance of the Witwatersrand in the political system ofthe Union lies not only in the number of representatives it sends to Parliament(although that is more than one-fifth of the total membership of the House of assembly), but also in the fact that the other principal geographical divisions ofthe country are so stereotyped in their political allegiances, and so nearly counter--balance each other, that, whoever winsy the Witwatersrand is assured. of a
majority in Parliament. The solidly pro-Government areas are the CapePeninsula (where all 12 seats in the present House of Assembly are held by theUnited Party); the Eastern Province of the Cape; Natal (where only one seatout of sixteen is held by a former Nationalist who is now the able and impartialSpeaker of the House of Assembly); and the Eastern Transvaal, a stronghold ofthe old South African Party. The solidly Opposition areas, on the other hand,are the Cape Province from&apos; the borders of the Cape Peninsula eastwards to the borders of Port Elizabeth and northwards through the whole of the centraluplands to the Orange River; the Orange Free State, where, with the exceptionof one Bloemfontein seat held by Dr. Colin Steyn, the Minister of Justice, andthe Frankfort seat held by General Manie Botha, the Opposition groups haveundisputed predominance;&quot; the Western Transvaal, where the Nationalist land-owner, General Kemp, holds sway; and the Northern Transvaal, whereMr. Strydom has established his ascendancy. On the limits of these chiefgeographical divisions are debatable borderlands where the political conflictattains a special intensity; but they do not invalidate the generalisation that,with the Witwatersrand left out of consideration, the rest of the country isremarkably evenly divided between the Republican, anti-war Opposition and the supporters of the Government.62. The Witwatersrand, then, holds the key to the political conflict. In thegeneral election of 1938 it did not return a single Malanite; five of its membersfollowed General Hertzog in his secession from the United Party at the outbreakof war. I have already said that one of them, the Member for Germiston, and theonly English-speaking member to follow General Hertzog&apos;s lead in September1939, has since returned to his former allegiance. His action betrayed a realisa-tion that he would not retain his seat as an opponent of the war. Two Membersjoined the Afrikaner Party when it was formed in protest at the Nationalists&apos;treatment of General Hertzog, and the remaining two former Hertzogites nowsupport Dr. Malan. It is instructive to examine the nature of the constituenciesrepresented by these members. One is Vrededorp, the most disgraceful Europeanslum in the whole of the Union, where poor whites from the platteland who haveresisted attempts at rehabilitation have crowded together under appallingconditions; another is the unskilled industrial workers&apos; suburb of Fordsburg.This is represented by Mr. B. H. Schoeman, an able young Afrikaner who is oneof the few Nationalist Members of Parliament with any understanding of theproblems of industrial labour and social reform. The other two are constituencieson the edge of the urban areas where town merges gradually into country.63. So far, it is clear, the Nationalist Party has found few adherentsamong the workers of the Witwatersrancl. The causes of this failure are notdifficult to discover. The Nationalist Party is still dominated by the DutchReformed Church and by the large landholders, who exercise semi-patriarchalauthority over their less fortunate (or efficient) neighbours and the poor whiteswho live on sufferance on their land. Between them and the town workers there is,in fact, actual conflict of economic interest. The farming interest has used its political power to blackmail the Government with great success, and the peace-time system of subsidising the export of food-stuffs at enormous cost both to the health and pocket of the South African consumer is a tribute to its zeal. More-over, the young Afrikaner moving from farm to gold-mine makes in a few years a transition which his relatives in the platteland take time to accomplish.Between them there is fixed the gulf which divides the rootless civilisation of thetown from the traditional ways of farming life.Nationalists&apos; Sentimental Appeal.64. In the absence of common economic interests the Nationalist Party in/its approach to the Afrikaners of the towns bases its appeal on sentiment.: While it would be a mistake to underestimate the power of this appeal, it is clearthat the Boer tradition and folk-myth tend to wilt in the alien atmosphere of the towns. All experience, moreover, has shown that the Nationalists will not succeed in securing the support of the Afrikaans-speaking populations of thelarge towns by means of the sentimental appeal alone; and it is debarred by itsvery nature from emerging as the champion of working-class,interests. Neverthe-less, a strenuous attempt was begun five years ago by a group of young Nationalistintellectuals headed by a son of General Hertzog to import into the sphere of trades union organisation the isolationist tendencies that, as I have already described, are now flourishing in many parts of South African life. provided with considerable funds by a fortunate bequest, they set about organising within
the powerful Mineworkers&apos; Union an Afrikaner bloc which, it was hoped,would eventually capture control of the Union. This control was to be usediii the interests of the Nationalist Party and in ways which would embarrass the war effort even., to the point of precipitating a general strike on theWitwatersrand. The plot gave the Government and the heads.of the miningindustry some anxious moments in the first year of the war; but its failure hasbeen an encouraging demonstration of the refusal of Afrikaans workers on theWitwatersrand to be seduced by political and racial cries to the detriment of their economic and social interests.65. With these considerations in mind I believe that there is no reason atall to fear within the near future any considerable swing-over on theWitwatersrand towards nationalism. The Government coalition should be ableto hold its own in this most vital area; and unless the course of the war setsin motion some castastrophic collapse of the United Party&apos;s power in areas wherein the past it has been securely established, the Government coalition should bereturned to power by a reasonable margin.66. If, however, the prospects of the present Government in wartime seemreasonably secure, one enters a field of much more hazardous speculation whenthe post-war situation is considered. The crux of this question is the role which .will be played in post-war South Africa by the Labour^P-arty. In the elections of 1920 the Labour Party swept the towns at the expense of the Unionists, from whom the present United Party is in the main descended. The inevitable post-war reaction was in full swing, hopes of social improvement were in the air andthe Labour Party with no less than 21 members, held the balance of power. Withthis comfortable precedent in mind, the leaders of the present Labour Partyare showing signs of increasing self-confidence and a disposition to exact thefullest advantage from the situation. Their leader, Mr. Madeley, is in theCabinet, and, as Minister of Labour, has succeeded in piloting through Parlia-ment a number of useful measures for the benefit of the skilled European workers..Nevertheless, leading members of the party and his weekly newspaper atJohannesburg are not taking up an increasingly independent attitude towardsthe Government; and leading members of the Labour Party are active in the agitation for a fuller mobilisation of the country&apos;s resources, industrial andhuman. The Labour Party is now engaged in the congenial task of draftingelaborate programmes of social welfare for the post-war world; in the processthey are stealing a march on the United Party, which is prevented from putting up an effective competition partly by absorption in the responsibilities of officebut much more by the deference of most members of the Government to variousvested interests and their refusal to recognise the widespread drift of opinion inthe democratic countries towards the Left. The Labour Party is showing aspecial concern for the interests of the soldiers; and in this respect is engagedin a vigorous rivalry with the Communists, whose Springbok Legion (founded inthe soldiers&apos; interest) may grow in time to be an important political force.Labour and the Dominion Party.67. The Labour Party is not waiting for the end of the war to establishits claim to a larger representation in the House of Assembly. It has alreadypresented the United Party organisers with a demand to be allowed to contestat least eight seats on the Witwatersrand in addition to the two it already holds;and. in the eight Durban seats it is now busily engaged in undermining theposition of the right-wing Dominion Party, with whom it is associated at themoment only by a common alliance with the United Party. It is already invirtual control of the Durban City Council; and there seems little doubt that,with public opinion moving, as it is, to the Left, the Labour Party should nothave much difficulty in disposing of the Dominion Party, whose&quot; reactionaryattitude in consitutional and social questions has made it increasingly unpopularThe United Party might be forgiven if it chafed under the alliance with theDominion Party which prevents it from joining in the scramble for the Durban;seats.68. There are those in the United Party who fear that after the war amuch strengthened Labour Party will recreate the &apos;&apos; pact&apos;&apos; with the Nationaliststhat brought General Hertzog&apos;s Government to power in 1924. &quot;On that occasion the alliance was made possible by the Nationalists on the one hand promising notto use the majority so obtained for destroying the link with Britain and by theLabour Party on the other undertaking to go slow in its agitation for the
establishment of a &quot; Socialist Commonwealth &quot; in South Africa. Dr. Malan inthe years of the present war, however, has gone far beyond the stage in hisrepublican agitation which General Hertzog reached twenty years ago; and withthe campaign now at its height it hardly seems possible that; he could renounce,even temporarily, that ideal. On the other hand, he knows perfectly well that hewill never come to power by constitutional means without the support of somesection of the English-speaking people; and he may well consider that, until theyhave been converted to the republican programme, the attainment of power, evenif that meant compromise or postponement on the republican issue, would be preferable to a frustrated existence in opposition.69. Between the Nationalist and Labour parties are fundamental differences in outlook; but on the great overriding question of the African native&apos;s placein society they have much in common. The Nationalists fear the competition of the native worker with their weaker brethren, the.poor whites; and it is acardinal principle in their programme to extend the colour bar to every field of economic and social life. The Labour party, for its part, as the representativeexclusively of European workers, is filled with a deep suspicion of the capitalist-employing class who exercise so great an influence on the United Party. Itwatches with some alarm the dawning realisation of the need for giving thenative greater opportunities in industry as a prime condition of developingmanufactures in this country. It fears that the large employers of labour may,after the war, attempt to use native semi-skilled labour as an instrument to weaken the position and bargaining power of the white trades unionists. Thiswas exactly the issue which precipitated the great strike on the Witwatersrandin 1922; and the danger, from the narrowly trades union standpoint, seems realenough. At the same time, the most elementary justice for the African people as well as the vital interests of this country call for the abolition of the restric-tions on the employment of natives in industry. In the long run, such a policy would be to the advantage of the white workers no less than to that of thecountry as a whole. How to combine a due regard for the immediate interestsof the white worker with the safeguarding of the country&apos;s future as a wholeis one of the most obstinate problems in the political life of the country. upon its solution hang issues of the utmost significance. In the meantime, it cannotbe too strongly emphasised that the Labour party, which after the war mayhold the balance of political power, is still, despite its present agitation for measures of social improvement, a definitely reactionary force on the mostimportant of all South African issues.(G) Natives, Cape Coloured and Indians.70. It is one of the major anomalies of South African life that the politicalconflict which rages within the ranks of the European population touchesfundamental social issues at so few points. The struggle over the republicanissue, which is coming to absorb the energies of the main political parties, is atbottom the struggle between an aggressive and exclusive nationalism which seeks to secure the domination of the State by one section of the while population,and an English-speaking minority determined to maintain its political, economicand social position in the State. But above the contending parties, and almostignored by them, looms the shadow of the non-European peoples, increasinglyaware both of the disabilities to which they are subjected and of the completedependence of the white man&apos;s society upon their labour. The white people have failed to adjust their political institutions to the overriding economic factthat the whole social structure of the country is built up on the basis of native and coloured labour. They have continued, to the point of positive danger, to upholdan untenable dichotomy between a &apos;&apos; political&apos;&apos; population of two millions andan &quot; economic &apos;&apos; population of ten millions. Until this dichotomy is resolvedthere oan be no guarantee of the permanence of real European civilisation in thesub-continent.71. At a time when the growing industrialisation of South Africa wasbringing natives in ever-increasing numbers to the towns, the white south africans chose in their political thinking to turn their backs on economic realityand to pretend that the &quot;native problem&quot; had been &quot;solved&quot; by general hertzog&apos;s Native Acts of 1936 and the official adoption of the theory ofsegregation. The native population, it was said, would be encouraged to&apos;&apos; develop on their own lines &apos;&apos; in areas demarcated from those of European
settlement; and General Hertzog made a solemn promise about funds for native-land purchase which has not been fulfilled in practice. At that very moment,however, complaints of farmers about the native Labour shortage were growingin volume; the gold-mines were denuding the native areas of young males; theSouth African system of native taxation was still being applied in all its rigourto force natives out of the reserves into European employment; and nativeadministration was proceeding with its policy of destroying the reality of tribalinstitutions. In the year when General Hertzog was expounding in parliamentary segregationalist theory which flew in the face of facts and of every economictrend in South Africa, natives made up no less than 38 per cent, of the total population of the towns. That proportion has increased in the intervening years. .72. Only six years later, however, the time had come for another PrimeMinister to show up the segregationist idea for the unreality it was. general smuts, in a large meeting in Cape Town at which I was present last January,snatched away its large shreds of respectability when he described the economicrevolution that was now taking place in South Africa and roundly declared thatthe process of industrialisation and urbanisation of the natives had finallydestroyed the practicability of segregation as a policy of government. - WhiteSouth Africa, he made it clear, had a solemn obligation as trustee to pursue the welfare of the native people. &quot; Even if we do not do it in the interest ofthe natives,&quot; he said, &quot; we will have to do it in our own interest; because if wedo not there will be something to pay.&quot; This, of course, is no novel doctrineto people grounded into the liberal tradition and it is at least as old asChristianity itself; but it is significant of the South African attitude in thesematters that a few words of lucid common-sense in the mouth of a Prime minister should be accorded the status of a new revelation.The Reserves.73.   For more than half a century now the native reserves of the Cape-Eastern Province have not been able to support their inhabitants from theirown resources.   Over-crowding and over-stocking have brought erosion and lossof fertility.   While the European owner of thousands of acres of land mightpay no income tax, a native pays 20s. or 30s. if he owns a hut in the reserves.Shortly before the war a duty of  250,000 was collected on blankets for the useof raw natives in the reserves valued at  443,000.   The threat of starvationand the necessity of earning a money wage to pay a money tax have combined &apos;to force the able-bodied young native males to spend long periods of their livesin employment on the farms,-the mines or in industry.   In the countryside thedocility and competition of native labour have prevented the transformation ofthe poor whites into a class of farm labourers; and when these same poor whitesdrifted to the towns they found themselves at hopeless disadvantage in competi-tion for unskilled work with the urban native population.   Natives in unskilledjobs before the migration of poor whites to the towns had held a virtual monopoly of unskilled and manual labour.  There had, indeed, developed a group of nativesequal, and often superior, in experience and efficiency to the poor white, whobegan to populate the slums of Johannesburg and other cities.  By 1911, with thepassage of the Mines and Works Act (amended and extended by the notorious&quot; Colour Bar &quot; Act of 1926), South Africa was well launched on the policyof reserving the whole field of skilled labour to the European trades unionistsand thus blocking the way of the new native proletariat towards economic and social improvement.  In 1924 the restrictive policy was applied by Parliament tothe field of unskilled labour in the interests of the poor white populations of the towns.    In that year the Department of Labour was set up- by the firstNationalist Government to protect certain fields for unskilled white labour, andthe &quot; civilised labour &quot; policy was enforced on the State railways.   Whereas in1921 there were 4,700 white labourers on the railways, this figure had increasedto nearly 16,000 in 1928.74. Between the years 1921 and-1936 the native population of the townswas almost doubled; in 1942 it amounts to nearly If millions. The&quot; conditions of life of this urban proletariat were described in my despatch No: 238 of the10th December, 1941. It is clear that both by legislative and by administrativemeans every conceivable obstacle lias been placed in the way of its rise in thesocial and economic scale. The native worker is denied any form of technical training and excluded even from unskilled work in which he might compete with[24647] . e
European labourers; his trades unions are specifically excluded from the processes of collective bargaining provided by the Industrial Conciliation Act and theprovision for the education of his children is shockingly inadequate. In 1939 theState expended  10,500,000 on European education,  934,300 on Nativeeducation and  965,100 on the education of Indians and Cape Coloured. Thisworks out at an expenditure per head of population of  5 for Europeans,2s. 8d. for natives, and 18s. 6d. for Asiatics and Cape Coloured.75. In the circumstances it is not surprising that the level of native wagesis so low and that the great majority of native families in the towns are unableto rise to the standard of a decent and tolerable existence. As the agriculturalreserves deteriorate still further under the pressure of expanding population, themovement to the towns will be accelerated. Already the consequences are being brought home to the Europeans by a disturbing increase of crime in recent months. A Committee has been set up by the Minister of Justice, in response toa public outcry for increased police protection, to enquire into the causes of thepresent native &quot; crime wave.&quot; In evidence before it, a high police official inJohannesburg has stated that, &apos;&apos; unless something drastic is done to save thenative youth of to-day, we shall be faced with a serious problem in the futurenot only on the Witwatersrand, but in all the larger centres of the Union.&quot; Therewere, he continued, probably tens of thousands of unemployed native youthsroaming the streets, and it was an urgent duty to prevent them from falling intocrime. The community had the duty of striving to make decent and well-behavedcitizens out of them. Better educational facilities, &quot; having regard to theexisting race prejudice,&quot; should be provided, and increased opportunities fordecent employment should be opened up.Expansion of Industries.76. The one hopeful factor in a depressing situation is the liberalisinginfluence which the new expansion of industry is already beginning to exert onthe public mind. It is everywhere admitted that a rise in native purchasing&apos; power is&quot; the first condition of the successful development of secondary manufac-tures in South Africa; another essential is a vast increase in the reservoir of skilled and semi-skilled labour, which cannot be provided by the present european population. The Labour Party, as I have said above, stands in the way of a relaxation of the restrictions on the employment of natives in skilled or semi-skilled work in industry; and the Nationalist Party will certainly, if and whenit attains power, do its best to ensure that every poor Afrikaner who is capableof work will be absorbed into industry before any field is opened to native^workers. But, if the expansion of secondary industry takes place on anything like the scale which will be necessary to make up for the inevitable decline in the productivity of the gold-mines, there should be a great increase of opportunityfor native workers.77. Up to a few years ago tJhe hopes of liberal-minded South Africans for-an improvement in the social and economic position of the native populationwere concentrated on the battle for political rights. In 1936, however, Boertraditions triumphed over the Cape Liberal ideal of equal rights for all civilisedmen . General Hertzog, at the head of the &quot; Fusion &quot; Government, forced the cape Liberals to agree to the abolition of the native vote in the Cape consti-constituencies and the substitution of the separate native &quot; communal &quot; roll. the cape natives were given the right to choose three Europeans to represent themin Parliament. These representatives have just completed their first term offive years in the House of Assembly, and it is generally agreed that they havedischarged a most difficult duty with considerable devotion and ability. One ofthem, Mrs. Ballinger (who is perhaps the ablest private member on the Governmentside), has now been returned unopposed for a further period of five years. Thesemembers have done much to educate public opinion as well as Parliament itself-on native matters, but their exiguous number gives them little influence on policy.In the Senate the natives are represented by four European members. Of these,one is elected by the natives of the Transvaal and Orange Free State combinedone by the Natal and two by the Cape natives. Apart.from this representationby Europeans in Parliament, the natives of the Union are represented in the natives&apos; Representative Council by twelve elected and four nominated nativemembers. The Council began its career with high hopes five years ago; it wasgiven by the Act of 1936 certain advisory and consultative functions, and it has,on the whole, performed its limited functions with good sense and ability. But,so far from increasing in authority, it has learnt from bitter experience that the
tendering of advice, however reasonable, is a long way from acceptance by government; and some of its ablest members are becoming a prey to cynicism anda sense of frustration.78. It seems clear enough now that the struggle for political rights has no prospect of success in the face of the almost united opposition of white south africans. At the same time, the mere possession of political rights has2 evenin most democratic countries, lost much of its appeal for the masses of the people.The emphasis in recent years has shifted to the economic. sphere, and everyindication goes to show that the awakening self-consciousness of the non-Europeanpeoples in the Union will find its most effective expression in the struggle for economic and social opportunity. At present, however, the natives of the Unionhave produced no leaders capable of uniting them in a national organisation;the poverty and lack of education of the mass of the people make a poor founda-tion for political agitation, and the African National Congress falls far shortin reality of its impressive name. The natives remain pathetically loyal to theBritish Crown and to the memory of Queen Victoria. They look back to theliberal policy of British administrations in Cape Colony, and they watch with interest and pride and envy the progress of Basutoland under Imperialadministration.   They unanimously oppose the concept of an Afrikaner republic.Communist Activity.79. The only European political group which shows any interest in theorganisation of the natives is the Communist Party, whose importance without this activity would be inconsiderable. Standing as it does for the abolition of alldiscrimination based on race and colour, it is not likely to gain many adherentsamong the European population : so far its converts have been drawn in themain from the European &apos;&apos; intellectuals &apos;&apos; of Johannesburg and Cape Town. Butto the native and coloured proletariat of the towns the Communist doctrine hasan instant appeal and the party is active in the organisation of the non-Europeantrades unions. Its general secretary is Moses Kotane, a native from the EasternProvince. Its influence is shortly to be tested by the elections for a EuropeanSenator to represent the natives of the two Northern Provinces and for the twourban members of the Natives&apos; Representative Council. In both of these electionsCommunist candidates have come forward.80. The present situation of the Cape Coloured people holds a specialtragedy of its own. Their numbers are small (800,000) as compared with thelarge total (about 7,000,000) of the native population; and until quite recentlythey had every hope of avoiding the fate that attends those who are depressedby the South African social system to the status of a &quot; problem.&quot; In the old CapeColony they had full and equal rights&quot; of citizenship and in the years of his firstAdministration General Hertzog enunciated the principle that they were an integral part of the white community and could not be made the victims of discrimination. Within a few years, however, the Nationalist Party&apos;s policy had begun to apply the narrow doctrines of racial exclUsiveness to the Cape coloured people. This development was partly the result of the growing dominance of thetwo Northern Provinces in the party&apos;s counsels and partly the realisation thatthe coloured vote in the Cape (to which it had been confirmed by the Act of union) was solidly anti-Nationalist, despite the linguistic affinities with theAfrikaners.81. In 1930 the Nationalist Government extended the franchise to Europeanwomen but denied it to coloured women, and the following year franchise wasaccorded to white adult males but hedged around with numerous qualifications for coloured men. By 1938 Dr. Malan had raised the cry of residential &quot; segrega-tion &quot; for coloured people in the towns of the Cape Province; and that is now the accepted policy of the Nationalist Party. Socially, the coloured people arebeing thrust beyond the pale, and economically they are being subjected to.numerous handicaps by such extra-legislative means as the failure to provide them with proper technical education and with opportunities for apprenticeshipin skilled trades. Whereas education is compulsory for white children, no suchcompulsion is yet applied to tihe coloured people; there would not be nearly enoughschools available for them if it were. An example of present tendencies is therecent plea by Die Burger, the Nationalist organ in Cape Town, for the establish-ment of a third kind of school reserved for children on the debatable border-line between white and coloured. The Cape Coloured Corps have had a distinguishedrecord in East Africa and Libya in the present war, and their leaders are naturally
stressing this fact in claims for better treatment at the hands of the Government.At present 28,000 coloured persons are voters in constituencies in the CapeProvince. Their votes are likely to be cast solidly for supporters of the war andGeneral Smuts.Indian Political Question.82. This despatch is already too long to attempt the inclusion of anyadequate summary, of the Indian political question in South Africa. It mustsuffice to report that the Indian communities are at one in their demand for some political rights at present denied to them -and they seek representation onMunicipal Councils, Provincial Councils and, in the House of Assembly as Britishsubjects. In Durban in particular there are many wealthy educated Indianswho pay large sums in rates to the Municipality but are denied representationeither on the common roll of ratepayers or on a separate communal franchise.They are in fact subjected to segregation and a good deal of social ostracism. Inmy view the main obstacle to any political and social concessions to Indians isthe fear on the part of the European voter that any concessions to Indians isbut the thin end, of the wedge to further concessions to African natives. Indeed, Iam myself clear that the Indian question cannot be isolated, and is an integral part of the political and social status of all non-Europeans. The Indians them-selves are emphatic that they are superior to &quot; Kaffirs &quot; and must be differentiatedfrom them. Ostensibly their demand is still for representation on commonelectoral rolls with the Europeans. I am certain that this will never be accordedby any South African Parliament, and that the only chance is some form of separate communal representation. The Indians would only accept this if the representation thus accorded were by persons of Indian race. This would notonly create great social difficulties but would immediately raise the question of representation of African natives by natives instead of as at present byEuropeans.83. *There is little prospect of the Indian and natives making common cause over any issue. Indeed, there is little love lost between them, particularly inNatal, where Indians are most numerous and well organised. In Natal bothEuropeans and Natives feel the impact of Indian economic competition,, as wellas the different habits and way of life of the Indian settler. The poorer classes ofIndian in and around Durban mostly Tamil Hindus live in extreme squalor,and have in effect an even lower standard of living and personal dignity than theZulus, who form the local African population. In pride and physique the Zuluis the aristocrat, with great warlike traditions, among the Union&apos;s Africannatives. Consequently the Zulu tends to despise the Tamil and his politicalaspirations. I refer to this to illustrate the intense complexity and difficulties ofthe Indian problem.84. This despatch is an attempt to give a long-range view of the politicaloutlook in South Africa. My conclusions may appear depressing. But there isone final reason for some optimism, and this is the continued health and vigourof General Smuts. If he is spared to lead South Africa not only through the war to victory, but also during the difficult period of reconstruction, his individualinfluence on the course of history may be a corrective of the many dangerousclashes inherent in the present body politic. In experience, wisdom and foresighthe is pre-eminent. His loyalty and courage never falter, and if one great mancan divert apparent forces and make history the whole Commonwealth may be grateful for his outstanding services to South Africa, the Empire and humanity.I have, &amp;c.HARLECH, High Commissioner.
