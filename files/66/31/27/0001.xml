(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)152CONFIDENTIALW.P. (42) 547 COPY NO.^ /25TH NOVEMBER,  1942WAR CABINETSOCIAL INSURANCES AND ALLIED SERVICESSummary of Report &quot;by Sir William BevsridgeORIGIN AND TERMS OP reference the survey,  on which the recommendations of Sir william beveridge&apos;s Report on Social Insurance and Allied Services are&apos;based, was instituted on 10th June,  1941,The Committee&apos;s terms of reference were:-&quot;To undertake, with special reference to the inter-relation of the schemes, a survey of the existing nationalschemes of social insurance and allied services,  includingworkmen&apos;s compensation and to make recommendations,&quot;In January 1942,  it was announced to be &quot;within thepo,wer of the Committee to consider developments of the national insurance Schemes in the way of adding death benefits with anyother risks which are at present not covered by such schemes.&quot;The duty of survey was laid upon an interdepartmental committee.    With the exception of the Chairman, Sir william beveridge,  its members were officials of the departmentsconcerned with Social Security, namely Home Office, Ministry ofLabour and National Service, Ministry of Pensions, government actuary, Ministry of Health, Treasury, ReconstructionSecretariat, Board of Customs and Excise, Assistance Board,Department of Health for Scotland, Registry of friendly societies and Office of the Industrial Assurance Commissioner,,The departmental officials acted as the Chairman&apos;s&quot;advisers and assessors on the various technical andadministrative matters with which they were severally concerned;&quot;and the Report is the Report of Sir William Beveridge and not of the Committee (p,2 and para. 40),    The Committee receivedevidence from more than a hundred organisations and individuals.A full list is given in Appendix C;   a selectior. of the memoranda&apos;submitted are to bo printed in a separate volume.SURVEY OF EXISTING schemes the immediate task of the Committee was to attempt a comprehensive survey of the whole field of social insurance and allied services, which have been developed during the last50 years, and to show what provision is now made and how it ismade for the different needs of the population.r

The survey tills included health insurance,unemployment Insurance,  old age pensions, widows   andorphans1 pensions,, workmen/s compensation for industrialaccident and industrial disease,, non-contributory and supplementary pensions for old age, public assistance andblind assistance,,    It does not attempt to deal withother social provisions such as housing,  education orIndus trial welfare.The results of this survey are set out inAppendix B,  of the Report^ which gives a short historywith statistical details of the. existing social insurance schemes,-.    They show the gratifying fact that &quot;provisionfor most of the many varieties of need throughinterruption of earnings and other causes that may arise in modern industrial communities has already been made in britain on a scale not surpassed and hardly rivalled inany other country in the worldc      In one respect only.,namely limitation of medical service, both in the range of treatment which is provided as of right and in respectof the classes of persons to whom it is provided, doesBritain&apos;s achievement fall seriously short of what hasbeen accomplished elsewhere,.    It falls short,  also,  in itsprovision for cash benefit for maternity and funerals and through the defects of its system for workmen5scompensation.    The Report suggests that the existing provisions for social security require to be unified andtheir administration to be simplified so that certainpresent deficiencies,  anomalies and lack of co-ordinationmay be removed,,RECOMMENDATIONS......AND . changes the greater part of the Report is devoted to&apos; recommendations and changes proposed to that end.    Inmaking these proposals,  the Report &quot;uses experience but is not tied bjr experience;the scheme is in some ways a revolution, &quot;but in more important ways it is a naturaldevelopment from the past,- 11    It suggests much that is new,it retains basic features which are familiar,,    Inparticular the finaa// of the Plan for Social Securityrests on the present three&apos;- part scheme of contribution,from workers,,  employers and the State, which was established&apos; in 1911;, has &quot;been in force for thirty yearsand has won general acceptance.The three assumptions:    In the words of the Report no satisfactory scheme of social security can be devisedexcept on the following assumptions:-(A) Children&apos;s allowances for children up to theage of 15,  or if in full-time education upto the age of 16;(B) Comprehensive health and rehabilitation services for prevention and cure of disease andrestoration of capacity for work,  availableto all members of the community;(c)   FMnccn^-orvj of (..upZ oyment,  that is to sayavoidance of mass unemployment.

These assumptions are discussed In Part VT -of the Reports    Sir William Beveridge uses the termSocial Security.to denote &quot;the securing of an income to take the,place of earnings when they areinterrupted by unemployment,  sickness or accident,to provide for retirement through age,  to provide against loss of support hy the death of another person, and to meet exceptional expenditures,  suchas those connected with &quot;birth, death and marriage.Primarily soaial security means security of incomeup to a minimum, hut the provision of an incomeshould he associated with treatment designed tobring the interruption of earnings to an end as soonas possible. &quot;Social Security as envisaged in this report is pre-eminently not a plan &quot;for giving to everybodysomething for nothing and without trouble,, &quot;    It is a plan to secure to each citizen an income adequate tosatisfy a natural&apos;minimum standard &quot;on condition ofservice and contribution and in order to make and keep men fit for service,&quot;The changes suggested therefore &quot;accord with two views as to the lines on which the problem of income maintenance, should be approached;&quot; firstly,&quot;that benefit in return for contributions ratherthan free allowances from the State is what thepeople of Britain desire.&quot;  (paraD  21)    Secondly,&quot;whatever money is required for provision of insurance benefits should come from a Fund to whichthe recipients have contributed.0..The insuredpersons should not feel &quot;that income for idleness,,however caused, can come from a bottomless purse....The place for direct expenditure and organisation bythe State is in maintaining employment of the labourand other productive resources of the country,&quot;(para.  22)

The threo changes in. square brackets are^ in the words of the Report, &quot;proposal * &quot;which, though important and desirable in themselves, could be omitted without changing anything else in the scheme&quot;

UNIFICATION,The twenty--three changes proposed in the Report are concerned,on the one hand to, unify existing schemes, and on the other hand toextend these existing schemes to cover new classes of persons andnew types of risk,As regards unification;, Sir William Beveridge suggests that thereshould he a Ministry of Social Security which would take over theduties of present Government Departments in respect of health,pensions and unemployment insurance;    the work of the assistance board;    and the duties of local governmant authorities in respaotof public assistance0One stamp on one insurance document, payable weekly, would cover all social insurance schemes.    The rates of benefit and theconditions of contribution and benefit would, generally speaking,he assimilated,,EXTENSION&quot;As regards extension of social insurance,  the plan covers allcitizens without upper income limit, but the contributions made andtypes of benefit received would vary according to different needsof the six classes into which the population has been -divided, - the classes ares-I0 Employees (insured by weekly contributions on employment book)lie        Other gainfully occupied,  including employers,traders and independent workers of all kinds,(Insured by contribution on occupation card,)III,      Housewives, that is married women of working age,(Insured on marriage through housewife&apos;s policy)ivo        Otners of working age who are not gainfullyoccupied, as for example students above the ageof 16, persons of private means,  and unmarriedwomen engaged in domestic duties not for pay,(insured by contributions on Security Oard, )V. Persons below working age.VI, Persons retired above working age.   (insured by contributions paid during working ageffi)All classes will be insured for medical treatment andfuneral grant;    children&apos;s allowances will be payable for Glass Vjretirement pens:!ons to Class VI.      The benefits available tomarried women, Class III are a special feature of the Plan for social Security and are explained in paragraphs 339-347,Housewives are recognised as a distinct insurance class withbenefits adjusted to their special needs.    These include, in allcases, marriage grant, maternity grant, widowhood and separationprovisions and retirement pensionso    Share of the husband&apos;sunemployment or disability benefits and maternity grants differ, for reasons explained in the Report, between housewives who have nooccupation outside their homes and those who are gainfully occupied.RATES OF BENEFITSir William Beveridge bases his proposals as to rates ofbenefit upon calculations made of the minimum cost of subsistence.These calculations were made with the assistance of a technicaladvisory Committee,    For the purpose of fixing provisional ratesof benefit a price level, about 25 per cent above that for 1938has been chosen.    The following table shows the estimated minimumsubsistence requirements for aaults of working age at 1938 prices

In Table XI on page 91, thejpqrt shows that in 1901 there were about 2i million persons offeionable age,  in 1941 the figure was 5-g- million and in 1961 it willover 8 million.The increasing number of old persons makes the problem of old agensions very difficult and very costly.    These and other considerationsIf set out in paragraphs 233  - 2h0. -    Sir William Beveridge proposesja,t the present contributory pension of 10/- a week T(20/- for man and ii) should be raised to 14/-,  (25/- for man and wife),  in the firstfti of the new scheme, and would then rise by 1/- per week (l/6d per weekBmah and wife) every two years thereafter, and would by the end offity years be 24/- for the singles man and 40/- for man and wife.    thus it a period the contributory pension would increase, and the supple-pary or assistance pension based on a Means Test would gradually ceasebe necessary.    For the purpose of the Report the year 194.5 is taken aspfirst full year of the scheme and,  therefore, the full scale of con-jibutory pension would be reached in 1965,    This arrangement is somewhatfiilar to the arrangement in New Zealand which is referred to in paragraphsand 241 of the Report.    The arrangements just mentioned refer to peopleHare either contributory pensioners at the moment or are contributorsIpensions under the existing scheme.    In addition, Sir William BeveridgeEposes to bring into pensions insurance all other persons not at presentJluded, and for these persons the basic pension of 14/-(or 25/-)willsjrt to be paid ten years after the beginning of the scheme, he-, 1955,Sfwill rise to the full rate by 1965.    All these pensions will be made^transitional on retirement.    Existing pensioners in receipt of the 10/-&quot;h?ibutory pension will, however, have the option of continuing&quot;fork and receiving- the 10/- or retiring and going on to the 14/-ediately.    Persons who desire to continue working after pensionable age for men and 60 for women) will receive a higher contributory pensionRetirement according to the number of years they continue working afterfiionable age.    For each year that the claim for pension is deferred,.arrioa man will receive an extra 2/- per week on his pension, and apie man 1/- per week.    Examples of the manner in which the contributory]$iion will increase automatically are given in paragraph 242, andpPles of the manner in which the postponement of retirement additionsSrate are given in paragraph 246.

FINANCE180The Plan for Social Security is &quot;based on the contributoryprinciple,,    The Report considers the alternative of financing the whole scheme from general taxation but rejects this methodin favour of the contributory principle.    Only two items whichenter into the Social Security Budget will be financed whollyout of taxation; these are children&apos;s allowances and national assistance.    All1 the cash benefits other than these two itemswill be financed, out of a Social Insurance Fund into which willbe paid the contributions of insured persons, employers and an exchequer grant., \\ There will also be paid from this social insurance Fund a contribution towards the total cost of the health and rehabilitation services.The total expenditure on all items covered by the social security Budget is estimated at  697 million in 1945, rising to 858 million in 1965.    Details of the expenditure are given inTable XII.

Therealready exist large schemes of Health, Unemployment and PensionsInsurance, etc., and in 1938-39.these cost in total  342 million,During the present war extensions have been made in these services,particularly in the introduction of supplementary pensions and the&apos;raising of the rates of benefit in other schemes.    As a result ofthese and other factors, it is estimated that -the cost of thepresent schemes will be  432 million in 1945,   The Report thussuggests an increase in total expenditure of  265 million.    the proportions to be borne by each of the three parties concerned(Na tional Exchequer, insured persons and employers) are givenIn the following table.
