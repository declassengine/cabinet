yjlii DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; G government copy No.P.   (42)  564 WAR CABINET6h December,  1942. ^ CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMr--:--Memorandum, by the Secretary of State for the Colonies,1* In September 1941 with the approval of the War Cabinet(W. P. (G) (41) 82) the    Governor of Ceylon was instructed to give to the Ministers In Ceylon the following, statement:?-4 &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have had. under consideration the question of constitutional reform in Ceylon.    The urgency and importance of the reform of the Constitution is fully recognised &quot;by His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot;but before taking decisions on the present proposals for reform,  concerning whichthere has been so little unanimity, but which are of such importance to-the well being of Ceylon, His.Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould desire that the position&quot;should he further examined and made the subject of further consultation by means of aCommission or Conference.    The Board of Ministers will appreciate that this cannot be arranged under war conditions,but the matter will be taken up with the least possible delay-after the war&quot;.2* Constitutional reform in Ceylon is a problem-conditioned by communal differences between the majoritycommunity (Sinhalese) and several minority communities (ceylon and Indian Tamils, Burghers,&apos; Muslims,  and Europeans).    Sincethe entry of Japan into the war,  and the consequent threat to ceylon&apos;s own security,  communal&apos; differences on the surface atleast have been less obvious, and all communities have -operated in the war effort,3* On the 26th March the State Council passed aresolution requesting a visit by Sir Stafford Cripps to ceylon and demanding &quot;the conferment of Dominion status on Ceylon afterthe war&quot; and requested &quot;&quot;that the British Government should give an assurance to that effect as has been done, in.the case&apos; of certain other British possessions&apos;1.&apos;.    The Governor, accordinglysent to my predecessor a message from the Board of Ministers,and after consultation with Sir Stafford Cripps he instructed theGovernor to inform the Board that Sir Stafford Cripps on Iris visitors&apos;to India would not have the opportunity to deal with Ceylonquestions,&apos; but that he took this occasion to renew on behalfof His Majesty&apos;s Government their pledge of.immediate, re-examination of Ceylon Constitutional reform once the victorywas won.    The Board of Ministers on the&apos; 8th October sent a message expressing disappointment and dissatisfaction withthis reply as talcing no account of what they regarded- as ademand for i\ status to which the people of Ceylon-were justlyentitled,  and claiming that an assurance on the linos-requested by the State Council, being in accord with repeatedaffirmations by leaders of the United Nations, would add to the enthusiasm with which -Ceylon &quot;had steadfastly co-operated inthe war - effort.    (The text of the Ministers&apos; message is printedas an annex to this memorandum).4*   ^ It is considered by the Governor that no progress has been, made towards a reconciliation of the respective demands.,ef the Majority and Minority political sections,  and thisview
&apos; view has been confirmed by a further message to mo from6 loading political members of the minority groups in theState Council reiterating that any declaration by HisMajesty&apos;s Government on the future Constitution of Ceylonmust &quot;in fairness&apos; and justice provide for adequate and ,effective safeguards for the Minorities in a balanced schemeof representation&quot;.    The Governor remains of the view that settlement can never be achieved&apos;by agreement amongst theSinhalese and the minority cormiunitics, but only by a decision&quot;of His Majesty&apos;s Government.    In these circumstances he ha3urged that in the reply sent to the message care should be -taken to avoid reference which might be likely to resuscitatecommunal recriminations which hinder the war effort andprejudice in:.particular the possibility of a Ceylon Tamilbeing elected in the near future to the vacant post-of minister of Home Affairs- in an otherwise all Sinhalese Boardof Ministers. - -5. I have consulted the Governor&apos;.as to the form.of the reply to the Board&apos;s message mid I -propose that he should be instructed to make to them the following statement, which hasbeen provisionally agreed with him:-- &quot;The re-examination of the reform of Ceylon&apos;sConstitution after the war,  to which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentstands pledged, will be directed towards the fullest possible development of self-governing institutions in Ceylon withinthe Commonwealth partnership having regard both to&apos; the singleinterest of the Island end-to the larger interest of.theCommonwealth 011 which the - Island&apos;s security and prosperityultimately depend.    In their approach to the question ofrevision of the Constitution in that spirit and intention therewill be on the part, of His Majesty&apos; s Government the fullest -appreciation of the effort and resolution which Ceylon raidher people have shown in defence of the Island and in the causeof the Commonwealth&apos;^I also propose that he should be instructed to reply to the message from the 6 Minority members to the effect that HisMajesty&apos;s Government&apos;s view is that decisions as to themanner in which the Constitution could most satisfactorily &quot;dodeveloped can only be reached after the post-war re-examinationof the whole constitutional position,  end that it would&apos;not be right for- His Majesty&apos;s Government to prejudge those decisionsnow in respect of the interests of any particular section ofthe people-6* It will be appreciated that trie proposed message tothe Board of Ministers goes further than previous statements in that no promise has been hitherto given that the .post-warconsideration of a reformed Constitution,  to .which HisMajesty&apos;s Government is committed, must &quot;do directed towardsthe fullest possible development of self-governing institutions in the Island..    A decision by His Majesty&apos;s Government however to reform the Ceylon Constitution in any other, direction than.)that of increased self-government would be in conflict with reasonable expectations and would confront us with very seriousreactions in the Island.Colonial Office,7th December,  19h2
A N IT B X.TelegramFROM CEYLONFftQM:        Governor (Sin A. Galdecott.)TO: Secretary of State for the Colonies.8th October, 192+2.No.  li+OlMinisters have requested me to telegraph to you the following message,, begins.There is growing concern in this countryregarding our political status after the war.    TheState Council at its mooting on 26th March 19U2 resolvedthat &quot;this Council demands conferment of Dominionsstatus on Ceylon after the war and requests that the .British Government should give an assurance to that effect as has been done in the case of certain ether british possesions&quot;.      The Ministers who are in entire accord withthe resolution communicated it to you with the request that effect be given to it.    In your reply dated 1st April 192+2you state that you renew en behalf of H.-M..G. their pledgeof immediate re-examination of Ceylon Constitutional reformsonce victory is won.      Wo are deeply disappointed anddissatisfied with this reply which takes no account of ademand made by the Council on behalf of the whole countryfor a status.to which the people of Ceylon are justlyentitled. , Ceylon has always given the greatest possible measure of co-operation, in prosecution of the war.    It hasbeen repeatedly affirmed, by leaders of United Nations thatthey are fighting for the freedom of the peoples of theworld and against tyranny and oppression.      The enthusiasticco-operation in this war of a subject race like ourselvesmust be the natural result of expectations to share thatfreedom.    Our demand is not only reasonable but will resultin adding to the enthusiasm of the war effort.    In those circumstances the assurance demanded by the State council should be given without delay.      Ends.
