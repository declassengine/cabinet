secret.P.(42) 548 COPY NO.25th November, 19A2 /CABINETTHE ASSESSMENT OF PUBLIC FEELING AT HOMEMemorandum by the Minister of information.&apos;       At their meeting on 12th October the War Cabinet asked me to furnish amemorandum explaining the system adopted in the compilation of the periodicalpaper that I submit under the title of &quot;Report on Home Opinion&quot; (item- A,138th Conclusions),     Their basis is the weekly Home Intelligence Reports whichare drawn up by the Ministry of Information, and I must first explain thereforewhat is the genesis of these Reports,2,:        There is a Regional Information Officer in each of the Civil DefenceRegions,     On his staff are one or more regional intelligence officers whosejob it is to make a. weekly report to headquarters about public feeling in their area.     They gather their material partly through their own observation andpartly through &quot;contacts&quot;   - that is someone who is supposed to be sensible andlevel headed and whose calling (c*g, doctor, woman social worker, publican,trade union official) brings him into daily contact with many people.     Anintelligence officer is expected to develop numerous contacts of this kind andhe should got a minimum of 30 reports a week.3*        In London the various regional reports are checked against each other and a lot of additional material is drawn up for cross checks.     This materialconsists of Postal Censorship reports, Police reports from the Home Office,B.B.C, Listener Research reports and contributions from voluntary societiessuch as the W,V.S, and Citizens&apos; Advice Bureau,A,        Out of all this comes the Weekly Home Intelligence Report,     So far as anhonest attempt at objectivity can achieve it these reports are intended to reflect the main currents of thought and feeling revealed by a comparison of allthe available material to which, certainly, a very great number of people have contributed.5* The periodical Report which. T lay before the War Cabinet is bestdescribed as an essay based on a close study and comparison of the trendsdisplayed in the weekly reports covering the period under review.     We have made it our rule not to introduce on our own responsibility subjects Which thereports do not deal with.     The draft of the periodical report is submitted-tome by the Director General after its form and contents have been agreed at meetings attended by senior officials in the Ministry.     It is also discussedinformally with the Public Relations Officers of some of the other Departmentswhose wo3?k keeps them specially in touch with the home public.B.- B.25th November. 1942.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF.
