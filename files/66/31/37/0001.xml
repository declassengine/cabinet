THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  November 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 557.November 29, 1942.WAR CABINET.EXTRA-TERRITORIALITY IN CHINA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE comments of the Chinese Government on the draft treaty for the abrogation of extra-territorial rights, of which I circulated a copy to my colleagues in W.P. (42) 503 of the 2nd November, have now been received and considered in consultation with the United States Government so far as issues of common interest are concerned. A large measure of agreement has been achieved between us. The United States Government have now made their formal reply to theChinese Government, and I am about to send corresponding instructions to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Chungking.There is a major point, however, on which we differ, namely, the inclusionof a provision whereby our nationals would be granted in China on a reciprocalbasis national treatment in the carrying on commerce. This point is covered in the second sentence of Article 6 of our draft treaty. The Chinese have raisedobjection and the United States Government, whose insertion of a similar provision in their draft treaty was only secured with difficulty, have yielded tothis objection for the reason that their Federal and State legislation make itdifficult for them to reciprocate.The fact that the United States Government have given way makes ourprospect of successful negotiations on this point problematical. But since weare able in the British territories covered by the treaty to give the Chinesereciprocal treatment we are clearly entitled to press the point.It has been my aim throughout the present negotiations to try and securethat our relationship with China shall be placed on a basis of genuine equalityand reciprocity, and that the loss of our extra-territorial rights shall not producenew inequalities to our detriment.In spite, therefore, of the fact that we shall not have United States support in fighting this particular battle, I propose to instruct His Majesy&apos;s ambassador to stand out for national treatment for our commerce, even though it may delay the signing of a treaty, and I trust that my colleagues will approve.There is another point of major importance outstanding in which the UnitedStates are not concerned. The Chinese Government have proposed as part of our treaty that we shall agree to. abandon our position in the Kowloon LeasedTerritory or &quot; New Territory &quot; acquired under the Convention for the Extensionof Hong Kong Territory of 1898. This is a proposal which I feel shouldbe strongly resisted, but it raises certain difficulties which the Foreign Office arediscussing with the Colonial Office and Service Departments. I propose very shortly to consult my colleagues on the answer to be returned to the ChineseGovernment on this point.A. E.Foreign Office,November 29, 1942.[24687]
