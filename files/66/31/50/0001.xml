THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY,&apos;S government most SECRET.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AMD ^ICEYIt is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this documentI.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.AT the meeting of the Cabinet on man-power (W.M. (42) 163rdConclusions) I was asked to submit a statement showing what modificationswould be necessary in programmes, and- the consequences involved, as a resultof the cuts in stated man-power requirements.2. I originally asked for 509,000 men and women to cover our requirements for the Fleet and for industry from July 1942 to December 1943. The PrimeMinister has proposed a cut of 75,000.3. I cannot contemplate any reduction in the numbers for manning theFleet. These men are required to fight ships which are for the most part nowbuilding or on order. No allowance was made for contingencies, although wehave appointed a Sub-Committee to exercise economies which would contribute to contingencies. I might, however, have to raise again the question of increasingrequirements for service personnel if the War Cabinefs future plans were- to.impose increased commitments on the Navy.4. The whole of this cut must therefore fall on the Admiralty&apos;s requirements for additional labour in industry, towards meeting which we should then receive110,000 men and women.5. The Prime Minister has said that the highest priority must be accorded to vessels and weapons for use against the U-boat and that no fall in theconstruction of merchant ships below 1,100,000 tons a year or slowing down of repair work can be accepted. The acceleration of the escort vessel programme which the Admiralty is working to must therefore be maintained in spite of the reduced addition to the Admiralty.&apos;s labour requirement which I am prepared toaccept. The maintenance of the escort vessel programme will, however, only bepossible at considerable cost to the acceleration of the programme elsewhere andparticularly in the categories of larger warships.6. The severe cut in the Admiralty&apos;s requirements of man-power for industry emphasises the necessity for the supply of young and able-bodied men for the shipyards if the escort vessel programme in particular is to be maintained.Difficulties which have been experienced in obtaining such men lead to theconclusion that they can only be obtained by diverting men who would otherwisejoin the fighting services. The question of avoiding any further withdrawalsof men from the shipbuilding industry is under consideration with the Ministryof Labour following on the reference to this matter at the first meeting of the anti-U-boat Committee.A. Y. A. .December 7, 1942.[24731]B
1. The proposed cut of 300,000 men and 80,000 women represents an effectivecut-in man-power of 364,000, since the women would have replaced men inapproximately the ratio of 5 to 4.2. Every effort will be made to meet this readjustment in personnel. Thefollowing commitments will be examined with a view to reduction : (a) Man-power required for building up Middle East and West Africa.&quot;   (5) Provision for wastage.   This will be cut drastically.(c) Coast defences in the United Kingdom.id) Static headquarters, schools, &amp;c, in the United Kingdom.(e) Training establishments.(/) A.D.G.B.The extent of reductions in the above can only be determined after careful examination but are expected to amount to a total of 150,000.3. This will still leave a wide gap to be filled before a total cut of 364,000is made.The only other method by which considerable savings can be realised is bythe reduction of formations, and the War Office may be forced to adopt this method. It would involve the reduction of a maximum of four divisions on overseas scales and would be adopted, even if only in part, as a very last resort.4. In the worst case, the 17 British, Canadian and Allied divisions for&quot; Roundup &quot; may have to be reduced to 13 divisions. These figures do not includeForce 125-,&apos;the airborne division or the Royal Marine division. If six divisions are not required in the Western Mediterranean any divisions saved can be addedto &quot; Roundup.&quot;5. The contingent reduction of four divisions is the maximum which need be contemplated at present. If,. however, there are unexpected reverses, andaverage battle casualties turn out to be higher than are assumed for the present purpose, it. is possible that there may have to be further cannibalisation of divisions later on up to the point where annual intake balances wastage for allcauses.6. In order to prepare the number of divisions.mentioned above for overseasoperations, it is essential that the intakes for the first half of 1943 should be kept to the highest possible level and maintained at 25,000 or more a month for thefirst five months.7. Since the intakes will be used mainly for producing technical services,they must be of the highest possible intelligence grades. The intake of tradesmenmust also be increased and any tradesmen who may be thrown up by the Ministryof Supply should be reserved for the Army.8. The Army demands on the Ministry of Supply will be revised and theproduction of equipment deferred to the maximum possible extent. Precisefigures cannot be given until the programme of equipment has been phased and theresults worked out in detail with the Ministry of Supply. Nor is it possible to say whether this revision is likely to do more than enable the Ministry to suffer the cuts already enjoined upon them by the Prime Ministers directive.9. Subject to approval for a minimum intake of 25,000 for the first five months of 1943, concrete plans can be made and the necessary reductions effected.The situation can then be reviewed in April or May 1943, by which time the fulleffects of the reductions made and the result of current operations should.beapparent.10.   To sum up, the effect of the proposed cuts are : (a) Commitments in the Middle East and West Africa must be contracted tothe greatest possible extent.(&amp;) Further reductions will be made in coast defences and in static units and considerable risks taken regarding the wastage provision.
(c) The possibility of reducing A.D.G.B. and other Services will be examined.\d) The War Office may be compelled to reduce such number of divisions asmay be necessary to meet the potential deficiency in personnel, as mentioned in paragraph 3.(e) The present demands for equipment will be revised and phased so as toenable every possible reduction to be made in Ministry of Supply man-power.P.

1. Following on the conclusions of the War Cabinet on the 1st December,1942 (W.M. (42) 163rd Conclusions), discussions have been undertaken with theWar Office with a view to effecting reductions in the Supply Programme for theArmy during 1943 which would permit the Ministry of Supply allocation oflabour for the munitions industries to be reduced from the previous target figureof 1,795,000 to 1.580,000 at the 31st December, 1943, i.e., to carry out the reductionproposed by the Prime Minister.2. Owing to the wide range of stores involved and the need for detailed discussions with the General Staff, the process of establishing this reduction indetail must necessarily take time. It has, however, been indicated- that theWar Office will be prepared to defer certain elements in their requirements for1943 (e.g., reserves and maintenance) until 1944, and such deferment will permit of a general scaling down of detailed production programmes, particularly in thesecond half of 1943.3. In addition, suggestions have been made by the Ministry of Supply tothe War Office for a number of special cuts in production programmes, calculated to give a relatively high yield in saving of labour.   These include : Gun Ammunition, with particular reference to-3-7-inch A.A. H.E.25-pdr. H.E.40-mm. H.E.Mortar Ammunition.Small Arms Ammunition, with particular reference to -303-inch Mk. VII Ball.Chemical Weapons.The U.P. Programme.Medium and Heavy Artillery Equipments and Ammunition.Sten Guns.-38-inch Revolvers.Spare Gun Barrels.Binoculars and Telescopes.Signal Stores.Searchlights and Ancillary Stores.Engineer Stores.Weapons appropriate to the Home Guard.4. The extent to which the reductions on these items are practicable oracceptable to the War Office has not yet been determined. Curtailment of anytype of munition store carries a consequential reduction of requirement in ancillary stores, e.g.. curtailment of 5-inch U.P. shell reduces the demand forcordite, and ammunition boxes.5. From amongst these proposals there is reasonable prospect of reaching agreement in detail which will permit of savings of labour during 1943 approxi-mately to the total indicated by the Prime Minister.-6. On the Prime Ministers instructions, immediate steps are being takento curtail the production of chemical warfare supplies.A. R. D.Ministry of Supply, December 7, 1942.

(42) 556. At the same meeting it was decided that a cut of100,000 in the labour programme of the aircraft industry should be assumed, in place of the 75,000 proposed by the Prime Minister.2. The order of magnitude of the consequential reduction in our plannedprogramme of air expansion is some 70 squadrons by the end of 1943, rising toover 100 squadrons by June 1944. This estimate is arrived at after making allpossible adjustments in those branches of the Air Force not directly concernedwith the operation of aircraft, such as the Balloon Barrage and the Royal AirForce Regiment.   Further details are included in the Annex.3. Except in the Heavy Bomber expansion programme, where severe reduc-tions are inevitable unless we can secure an allocation of American heavy bombers in excess of that recently agreed with the United States, no attempt hasbeen made to distribute the cut between the various classes of squadron and thevarious theatres of war. Indeed, it is impossible to attempt such a distribution in the absence of any strategic policy agreed between the United Nations for thefuture conduct of the war. But it is a most disturbing thought to contemplateat this stage of the war a reduction in our planned air strength of over100 squadrons, of which a substantial proportion is bound to fall upon those elements of the Air Force engaged in co-operation with the other Services.The one factor above all which has contributed to our defeats and limited oursuccesses in the last three years has been lack of adequate air power. demands for ever increasing air cover and support are a common feature of our plans for operations, whether over land or over the sea. Moreover, the reductions will bemade at a time when the United States are assembling beyond the Atlantic anarmy of Vast proportions.4. The distribution of the cuts between classes of aircraft and theatres ofwar also depends on the extent and direction of American participation on land and in the air in areas of British strategic responsibility. Thus, the finalredistribution of our air power must be planned in conjunction with the UnitedStates, of whose full intentions in this respect we are at present unaware.5. We have just secured substantial allocations of aircraft from the UnitedStates on the plea that an added measure of replacement of R.A.F. Squadrons inBritish theatres of war by American units would be uneconomical and militarilyunsound. If it is now necessary, to inform the United States of a generalcurtailment of the expansion programme the basis of the allocations will be destroyed and a severe reduction would almost certainly result.6. Our existing air expansion programme provides for the addition during1943 of 130 squadrons to the first-line fighting strength of the Air Force, composed as follows    -

7. If the proposed man-power reductions are accepted, the above total mustbe reduced to some 60 squadrons. This estimate is based on the assumption thatthe training programme is reduced more or less pro rata with the first-lineexpansion, and that no provision is made to enable the parts of the R.A.F. selected for reduction to be brought rapidly up to full fighting strength by the temporarytransfer of maintenance personnel from other units. If such provision weremade, it would involve a substantial further reduction of first-line strength.8. The reductions include a cut in the Heavy Bomber programme of14 squadrons by the end of 1943, rising to 19 squadrons by mid-1944. I neednot elaborate the effect of this in reducing our capacity to strike at the foundations of German military power further than to remind my colleagues that the Chiefsof Staff have recommended that priorities in the spheres of man-power, material and-production should be adjusted to enable us to undertake, as a first charge on our resources, the building up of a great Anglo-American bomber force in thiscountry by the summer of 1944.9. The detailed incidence of the reduction in squadrons other than theHeavy Bomber squadrons of Bomber Command cannot be settled until we havedecided on the pattern of the war in 1943. The planned expansion of 84 squadrons in these classes included 34 flying boat, general reconnaissance and torpedofighter squadrons for the war at sea. It also included 40 bomber and fighter squadrons for the Middle East and India; the decisions on this head are linked with our possible commitments in the Mediterranean area, in the Caucasus orfor re-opening the Burma Road. The possibility of offsetting some of these cutsby reductions in the planned strength of Fighter Command and army co-operation Command is dependent on a decision about a return to the Continentin 1943.10. A decision on strategic priorities not merely for Great Britain alonebut for the United Nations as an alliance is urgently required; it would, ofcourse, govern production and man-power priorities. In particular, we must atonce make rlear to the United States the effect of the drastic limitation in ourplanned military capacity, and decide with them the necessary adjustments in allied air poAver in the various theatres of war.11. A separate aspect of the problem is that if the man-power intake ofthe Royal Air Force is cut as proposed in W.P. (42) 556, the proportion ofDominion and Allied aircrews in the Royal Air Force would continue to riseuntil by mid-1944 over half of the flow of trained aircrews into squadrons wouldbe of Dominion and Allied nationalities.12. It must be realised that the effect of the decisions to be taken on thissubject will be critical and enduring. It will not be possible in six months&apos;time to reverse the decision or at least to give effect to such a reversal undera period of many months. It is therefore essential to take a long-term view,and to realise that any decision taken to-day will stamp the pattern of our airpower throughout 1943 and 1944.13. The estimates in this memorandum are based on the assumption thatthe joint man-power requirements of the Air Ministry and the M.A.P. will be cut by 325,000 of which 100,000 will be borne by the MAP. labour programme.The best distribution of the cut will, however, require careful study and it maybe necessary to arrange for a rather larger share to be borne by the M.A.P.This important point is now being studied and any necessary adjustmentsbetween the intake programmes of the two Departments will be carried out inconsultation with the Minister of Aircraft Production.December 8, 1942.
ANNEX.Effect on the Development of the Royal Air Force of the Man-PowerCuts proposed in W.P. (42) 556.Supply of Men and Women to the Royal Air Force throughout 1943.The man-power problem of the Royal Air Force for the year 1943 can besummarised as follows : Men. Women. Total.Demand for the 18-month period July, 1942, to 31st December.1943       ............     365,000 107,000 472,000Deduct: Intake for period 1st July,1942, to 31st December. 1943           120,000 54.500 174,500Demand for 1943 is accordingly ... 245,000 52,500 297,500Deduct: Cut proposed in W.P. (42)556, namely       ......       ...      185,000 40,000 225,000Leaving net intake for 1943 at ...       60,000 12,500 72.5002. Before the Lord Presidents enquiry, the man-power requirements of theRoyal Air Force were subjected to thorough examination with the object ofminimising the demand. As the result of drastic pruning, the demand was reduced by about 100,000 men and women. In consequence, the cuts proposed in w.P. (42) 556 are bound to involve a serious limitation of the effective strengthof the Force.3. The exact reductions in the Target Force for R.A.F. expansion cannot yet be determined. They depend, among other things, on decisions on future strategy, and they must in any event be settled in consultation with theother Service Departments. Careful adjustment of the programme with that ofthe Ministry of Aircraft Production is also necessary to ensure that theman-power resources of the Royal Air Force and of the aircraft industry,considered as one unit, are disposed to maximum advantage.4. Only the broad effect of the cuts, therefore, can be estimated at this stage,and this is described below.Effect on R.A.F. expansion of the cut of 100,000 men and women in the M.A.P.labour programme.5. The main development of the aircraft industry in 1943 is in the directionof expanding the heavy bomber output. Certain increases in lighter types arealso scheduled but the dominant share of the M.A.P. labour intake for 1943 willbe absorbed by the heavy bomber programme.6. In the opinion of the Ministry of Aircraft Production the general pattern of aircraft production for 1943 cannot be changed at short notice. Ifthis is so, the cut of 100,000 men and women in the MAP. labour intake mustfall almost entirely on the planned output of heavy bombers.7. The planned output of heavy bombers for 1943 totals some 6,300. Thelabour force of the aircraft industry is already some months behind scheduleand, apart altogether from the cuts proposed in W.P. (42) 556, there would bea shortfall of 1,600 heavy bombers in 1943. The cut of 100,000 men and women would involve a further loss of some 400 heavy bombers in 1943. The revisedforecast of heavy bomber output for 1943 is therefore of the order of 4,300.8, Our heavy bomber expansion has been planned on the assumption thatwe, should receive 85 per cent, of the planned programme in heavy bombers untilthe middle of 1943 and that thereafter the percentage would improve until, bythe end of 1943, the output would be 100 per cent, of programme. The reductionsforeshadowed in paragraphs 5-7 mean that the percentage achievement of the planned programme will be 65 per cent, at the beginning of 1943, rising to 75 percent, at the end. Thereafter, the output of heavy bombers will continue to riseuntil a peak output of 570 a month, representing 88 per cent, of the plannedprogramme, is achieved in the autumn of 1944.9. Unless this loss of planned output can be offset by an allocation of heavy bombers from the United States in excess of that recently agreed, the effect on the planned programme of heavy bomber expansion will be as follows :-December June December1943. 1944. 1944.   - -Planned..........        90 120 138Reduced to.........&apos;      76 101 119
10. The consequent reduction in the man-power requirements of the R.A.F.in 1943 will amount to 15,000.Reduction in Planned Expansion of Transport Squadrons.11. There is also the reduction in the transport squadron programme. Wehad planned to receive about 1,100 transport aircraft from the United States in.1943 and will now receive only 600. The consequent reduction in the expansion programme for transport squadrons makes it possible to reduce our man-power requirements for 1943 by about 10,000.Reduction in Home Establishments, in Balloon Command and in theR.A.F. Regiment.(a) Cuts in Home Establishments.12. With the co-operation of all A.Os.C.-in-C, a further review of individual establishments and of administrative policies is being conducted. the potential field is now very limited in view of the measures referred to in para-graph 2, but the possibility of further savings amounting to 30,000 men andwomen in 1943 has been assumed.(b) Reduction in the Balloon Barrage.13.   The present establishment of Balloon Command is50,000 men and women.   It is proposed to effect a reduction of approximately40 per cent, by eliminating certain sites and thinning others.   This will effect a saving of roughly 20,000 men and women in 1943.(c) Reduction in the R.A.F. Regiment.14. It is also proposed to effect a cut of roughly one-quarter in the R.A.F.Regiment. As the scale of light A.A. defence of aerodromes is already very thin,the cuts must be made mainly at the expense of the rifle and armoured squadrons,which will be reduced to the extent of about 60 per cent. This will affect theprovision of aerodrome defence units in connection with possible operations on theContinent and throw an added burden on the Army. The saving estimated underthis head amounts to 20,000 men in 1943.Reduction in planned expansion other than heavy bombers.15. As stated in paragraph 1, the intake of men and women, during 1943required to continue the planned expansion amounts to 297,500. As a result ofthe reductions indicated in paragraphs 9-14 above, this demand could be reducedto about 202,500. The number of men and women available for intake to theRoyal Air Force &quot;after the application of the cuts proposed in W.F. (42) 556would amount to 72.500.   There is thus a gap of 130,000.16. Having trimmed administrative services and ancillary units to thelimit, this gap can only be bridged by a further reduction in the programme for forming new squadrons. The exact nature of the reduction cannot yet bedetermined as it depends on the distribution of the cut between the various classes of squadrons. Broadly speaking, however, the further loss will amountto some 57 average squadrons* by the end of 1943 and to 89 average squadronsby June 1944 in addition to the loss of heavy bomber squadrons described inparagraph 9.   The total loss of squadrons is thus : 14 heavy bomber squadrons 4- 57 average squadrons, total 71 squadronsby the end of 1943.19 heavy bomber squadrons -f- 89 average squadrons, total 108 squadronsby the end of June 1944.17.   The effect of these cuts on the total planned expansion of the R.A.F.would be as follows :-December December June1942. 1943. 1944.Squadrons. Squadrons. Squadrons.Former Plan     ......      365 502 568Reduced Plan   .....,     :365 (378t)      431 46018. The effect of the cut on the ultimate size of the Royal Air Force will depend on decisions which have yet to be taken regarding the distribution of the limited supply of man-power which will become available in 1944.* Note. The man-power reduction is expressed in terms of average squadrons as thenumber of aircrew and ground personnel differs considerably according to the-various classes of squadron, e.g., Bomber, Fighter, Flying Boat, Army Co-operation, &amp;c.\ The programme is at present slightly ahead of the Former Plan.
L h 4.materials.3. The additional labour required for the aircraft programme is mainly forincrease in heavy bombers. It follows, therefore, that any cut in the labour requirements will be reflected primarily in a loss of heavy bombers. If theprogramme were re-planned to spread the loss over other types of aircraft, this -planning could not have any marked effect for 12-18 months.4. It is estimated that unless the loss can be made good by increased efficiency the cut of 100,000 in the labour force will result in a drop of the peakoutput of heavy bombers in the Autumn of 1944 from 645 per month to 570 per month. The estimated loss of heavy bombers in 1943 in the intervening period will be 2,000 and in 1944 will be 1,200.5.   In order that the most effective use can be made of the reduced allocation of labour,, it will be necessary to arrange that (i) The flow of labour into the industry is regular and reliable month bymonth.

The future output of aircraft has to be considered in relation to thefollowing : (a) The present labour force in the industry is at the level which accordingto the plan should have been achieved some months ago. this deficiency has already been the cause of a considerable loss of output,which will persist through 1943 and 1944, apart from the presentproposed cut in the peak labour force.(6) The cut of the peak labour force from 2,120r000 to 2,020,000 with acorresponding cut in the intervening rate of intake will, unless an even greater acceleration of productivity can be achieved, lead to (i) increased shortfall in the period up to Autumn of 1944;(ii) a lower ceiling of output when the peak labour force has become fully effective about the Autumn of 1944.(c) The essential conditions (which are specified in paragraph 5 below) forefficiency in production regarding supply of labour, machine tools and
December 8, 1942.Note by the Lord President of the Council.In W.P. (42) 556 the Prime Minister proposed a cut of 100,000 in the civil defence services. Allowing for existing arrangements for withdrawals to industry. &amp;c, this meant a net reduction of 111.000 as compared with the strength at the 1st July, 1942. That strength was given in the Man-Power Survey as391,000, but this figure included 8,300 for Northern Ireland. The PrimeMinisters proposal thus involved a net reduction of 111,000 on a strength of383,700.2. The Ministers concerned, after consultation with me, have agreed to offer the following reductions, totalling 75,100 :   &apos;ProposedStrength at        Strength atJuly 1, 1942.

(42) 556). Theattached statement does not do that; it recommends a smaller reduction than thatwhich the Prime Minister suggested. The position of Civil Defence is, however,different from that of the other Services, for here we are dealing not with a curtailment of proposed expansion, but with a reduction of existing strengths.The whole-time personnel in the Civil Defence Services had already beenreduced by over 57,000 during the first six months of 1942.

In view of the heavy additional responsibilities of the police inwar time and the considerable reductions which have already been made in policestrength, the scope for a further reduction is necessarily limited. The police service has already undertaken to release the great majority of regular policemenunder 27 and of auxiliaries under 30, and the present establishments are basedsolely on essential day-to-day work, which continues as in peace time and is increased in many directions by war conditions. The Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for Scotland are, however, prepared to agree to a further reduction so that by the end of next year the combined strength of regulars andauxiliaries in the two countries will be 84,100, as compared with 101,100 on the1st July, 1942. This reduction takes into account 4-5,000 men who have alreadybeen released to the Armed Forces since July, and there will be a further cut of11,500 on current strengths (i.e., as at the 31st October).6. National Fire Service. The creation of the National Fire Service out ofabout 1,400 local fire brigades has involved some new calls on the man- andWoman-power for the higher operational and administrative staff and for the communications andeontrols of the larger formations which have been constituted;but, on the other hand, the nationalisation of the Service has relieved the localauthorities&apos; staffs of duties which they formerly performed, and the Service nowundertakes a considerable volume of building and vehicle repair work which would otherwise have been a burden on industry.7. About a year ago the requirements of the Service in Great Britain wereassessed by the Lord Presidents Committee at 128,300 men and 33,300 women(total 161,600). Before this figure had been reached, in order that the service should share in&apos;the release of men from Civil Defence for the Armed Forces andindustry, it was decided to suspend recruitment and reduce the male strengthof the Service by approximately 15 per cent. In pursuance of this decision thetotal whole-time strength of the National Fire Service fell, between the 30th june and the 30th September, 1942, from 136,200 to 132,200.8.

National Fire Service. The creation of the National Fire Service out ofabout 1,400 local fire brigades has involved some new calls on the man- andwoman-power for the higher operational and administrative staff and for thecommunicationsandcontrols of the larger formations which have been constituted;but, on the other hand, the nationalisation of the Service has relieved the localauthorities&apos; staffs of duties which they formerly performed, and the Service nowundertakes a considerable volume of building and vehicle repair work which would otherwise have been a burden on industry.7. About a.year ago the requirements of the Service in Great Britain wereassessed by the Lord Presidents Committee at 128,300 men and 33,300 women(total 161,600). Before this figure had been reached, in order that the service should share in the release of men from Civil Defence for the Armed Forces andindustry, it was decided to suspend recruitment and reduce the male strengthof the Service by approximately 15 per cent. In pursuance of this decision thetotal whole-time strength of the National Eire Service fell, between the .30th june and the 30th September, 1942, from 136,200 to 132,200.8. There is always a possibility of attacks, mainly incendiary in character,which may be delivered at any point and would be very heavy in comparison withthe reduced Fire Service strengths, especially in areas which are more open toattack or may become the focus of military activity.  Reinforcing, though greatly
facilitated by the nationalisation of the Service, is inherently slow in comparisonwith the spread of fire. The National Fire Service is in process of releasing tothe Army about 6,000 men who&apos; are either under the age of 27 or are members of class W Reserve, returned to the Fire Service following the heavy raids of&apos; 1940-41; and these men will be wholly lost to the Service there will be no possibility of adopting the. procedure referred to in paragraph 12 below to any great extent.9. Having reviewed the whole situation, the Ministers concerned do notthink it practicable to reduce the National Fire Service in Great Britain by morethan 10,000 (men and women together) in the ensuing twelve months, bringing thenet strength by 31st December, 1943, to approximately 122,200.10. Civil Defence (General) Services. At the height of the blitz there were128,000 men and 48,000 women (176,000 in all) employed in the Local AuthorityCivil Defence Services. Since then the Services have been extensively reorganisedand duties have been combined, with the result that by mid-1942 the numbers had fallen to 146,000 a reduction of nearly 30,000. By further extensive reductions,mainly involving the Wardens&apos; Service and a weakening of the Rescue Service(which would entail a distinct risk), it is thought that by the end of 1943 thewhole-time strength of the General Services can be reduced by a further 44,100.11.   Summarising the proposed reductions : At July 1,      At December 31,1942. 1943.The   regular   police   and   policeauxiliaries (both sexes) from ... 101.100 to 84,100 (17,000)The N.F.S. (both sexes) from ... 136,200 to 122,200 (14,000)The Civil Defence (General) Ser-vices from .........       146,400 to 102,300 (44,100)to be completed by the 31st December, 1943.Total reductions 75,100,12. The relative reductions of men and women and the distribution of the cuts remain to be determined later. In general most of the reductions will bemade in the London Region and the Industrial Midlands and North. It isessential that, so far as possible, the reduction should be made on the basis ofreleased personnel being placed in employment and not in the armed Forces. Inthe majority of cases, moreover, placing must be local in order that essentialCivil Defence Services may be reconstituted without delay by a recall of formermembers in the event of a resumption of heavy raiding. Only on this basis hasit been found possible to make reductions of the order now offered.&apos; 13. In the case of all these Services, reductions are being made, not onprogrammes of possible future expansion, but on actual working strengths of services which had already suffered heavy cuts by the 30th June last. (Ascompared with the strengths of establishments at the beginning of the year,including the N.F.S. programme of 161,600 which had just been settled, thereduction in these six months was over 57,000.) It is therefore essential, ineffecting the proposed further reductions, that allowance should be made forfurther wastage, and that, subject to any changes in the war situation, thestrengths should not be allowed to fall below the levels which have been indicated.14. It is also essential that key-men in the part-time Civil Defence services in certain areas should be protected from call-up or transfer to other areas.Unless such steps are taken it will be impossible to reconstitute the services incase of need.15. The reductions are agreed to. by the responsible Ministers only inpursuance of a policy inevitably involving substantial risks of impairing national security, for which the Cabinet as a whole accepts responsibility.H.
