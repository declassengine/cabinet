(42) 566.December 7, 1942.WAR CABINET.INDIA.CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF INDIAN SEAMEN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.AT the meeting of the War Cabinet on the 24th August (W.M. (42), 117thConclusions, Minute No. 1) I was invited to submit to the War Cabinet a reporton the consultations then proceeding on the subject of the pay and conditions ofservice of Indian seamen. As a result of consultations between the Minister ofLabour and National Service, the Minister of War Transport, the High Commis-sioner for India and myself, it has been agreed that the following broadconclusions should be submitted to the Government of India : (1) Wages. His Majesty&apos;s Government will consider sympathetically any reasonable proposals the Government of India may make to the ship-owners. The Minister of War Transport was not prepared to commit himself to any definite figures at this stage, but the-HighCommissioner has informed the Government of India that he hasreason to think that an increase; of the wages (including war bonus)of Indian deck hands to  10 a month, with a corresponding rise-inother categories, would probably be regarded as reasonable. (Thiswould compare with the present rate of  5 12s. Qd., which is already. three times the pre-war rate. The corresponding rates for european and Chinese seamen on British ships are now  22 12s. Qd. and: 16 15s. respectively.)(2) Hours of Work. The regulation of the hours of work of Indian seamen,for which at present no provision exists, requires attention, especiallyin view of the severe strain imposed by war conditions. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would not object to reasonable regulation of hours, withpayment of overtime or time off in lieu, if the Government of Indiamade proposals accordingly.(3) Accommodation. Accommodation on board some ships for Indian sea-men needs improvement, and His Majesty&apos;s Government are examining the question, particularly with regard to ships now coming under construction. Measures to improve accommodation for Indian seamenin British ports are in hand and considerable progress has been madein recent months.These conclusions have been telegraphed to the Government of India by theHigh Commissioner, and a detailed report has also been sent by air mail.L.
