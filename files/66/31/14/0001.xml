Summary.Distribution of the Population.I. At mid-1942, out of nearly 33^ million persons of working age (14-64)over 22^ million (15  million men and 7 million women) were engaged in some form of employment or service (para. 5).2. Since the beginning of the war over 2J million persons 650,000 men and1,900,000 women previously &quot; unoccupied &quot; or in private domestic service arenow engaged in some form of employment or service (para. 5).3. During the last year ,(ended the 30th dune, 1942),. 952,000 persons--52,000 men and 900,000 women-have been mobilised from the &quot; unoccupied &quot;or private domestic servants (para. 5).4. At mid-1942, 7,434,000 men (aged 14-64) and 2,166,000 women (aged14-59) were in the Forces, Civil Defence and munitions; 4,144,000 men and1,529,000 women in other essential industries; and 3,635,000 men and 3,357,000women in the less essential industries (para. 9 and Tables 1 to 3, Appendix I).Comparison between 1942 and 1918.5. Mobilisation of man-power had gone further towards the end of thethird year of this war than it had by the end of the fourth year of the last war,30 -1 per cent, of the population at mid-1942 being in the Forces, Civil defence and munitions compared with 27-8 per cent, in -1918, 17-7 per cent, in other essential industries compared with 15-3 per cent. and. 52-2 per cent, in the less-essential industries and the &quot; unoccupied compared with 56-9 per cent, in 1918(para. 10).Industry.6. There has been a decrease of the total labour force in industry betweenmid-1939 and mid-1942 of 1,473,000, a decrease of 3,000,000 men being partly offset by an increase of 1,527,000 women (paras. 22 and 23).7. There has been an increase in munitions between mid-1939 and mid-1942of 556,000 (20-1 per cent.) men and 1,248,000 (234-6 per cent.) women, making atotal increase of 1,804,000 (54-7 per. cent.) (para. 22 and Tables 1 to 3,Appendix I).8. For the year ended the 30th June, 1942, munitions increased by 155,000&apos;(4-9 per cent.) men and 664,000 (59-5 per cent.) women, making a total of 819,000(19-1 percent.) (para. 26).9. Other essential industries decreased during the 2 years mid-1939 and mid-1941 by 362,000 (6 1 per cent.), an increase of 402,000 (4-5 per cent.) womenbeing offset by a decrease of 764,000 (15-2 per cent.) men; but between mid-1941and mid-1942 they increased by 135,000 (2-4 per cent.), there being an increaseof 239,000 (18-5 per cent.) women and a decrease of 104,000 (2-4 per cent.) men(paras. 36, 37 and 38).10. In munitions and other essential industries together, there has been anincrease of nearly 1,900,000 women (paras. 22, 23 and 25).II. Agriculture increased during the year mid-1941 to mid-1942 by 10,000men and 36,000 women (para. 40).12. Civil establishments of Government Departments increased during theyear by 100,000, an increase of 109^000 women being offset by a decrease of 9,000men. For the three years mid-1939 to mid-1942 Government Departments haveexpanded by 61,000 men and 300,000 women (para. 40).13. Less essential industries decreased between niid-1939 and mid-1942 by ,050,000, made up of 2,688,000 men and 362,000 women; this represents a lossof over 30 per cent, of their total labour force over 42 per cent, of their men,and nearly 10 per cent, of their women (para. 47).14: Less essential industries decreased between mid-1941 and mid-1942 by789,000 (10-1 per cent.), made up of 558,000 (13-3.per cent.) men and 231,000(6-4 per cent.) women. The decrease in numbers of women reflects the acceleratedtransference to the Women&apos;s Services and munitions (para. 48).
Fit Men of Military A ge.15. At mid-1942 there were approximately 2,910,500 fit men of military age(18-^-42^ at the 31st December, 1942) in civilian employment. This total included504,210 men who were either available for enlistment or had been released fromthe Forces for industry (para. 96).16. The remaining 2,406,290 were reserved or deferred and represent thefield for consideration in connection with the supply of additional men for theForces. The total of 2,406,290 included 876,320 who were below 31. years of age and 1,529,970 who were 31 years of age and over (para. 96).17. Of the 876,320 young (i.e., 18^-30) fit men, 78,830 were in the &quot; less essential &quot; industries, 335,630 in the &quot; essential &quot; industries other than munitions,441,860 in munitions, and 20,000 in Civil Defence (para. 97).18. Of the 1,529,970 fit men of military age (i.e., up to 42^ at 31st December,1942) 31 years of age and over, 334,240 were in the &quot; less essential &quot; industries,582,260 in the &quot; essential &quot; industries other than munitions, 504,470 in munitions,and 109,000 in Civil Defence (para. 99).Women.19. At mid-1942 there were 15,710,000 women aged 14-59 in the CivilPopulation; of these 8,397,000, or 53-4 per cent., were in the age classes 18-40.Of the 8,397,000 aged 18-40, about 2,992,000, or 35 - 6 per cent., were single, and1,685,000, or 20 -1 per cent, were married without children under 14 living withthem (paras. 101 and 103).20. At mid-1942 there were 6,666,000 women aged 14-59 in industry; ofthese 4,346,000 were in the age classes 18-40 (para. 104).21. About 74 per cent, of the single women aged 18-40 and 74 per cent, ofthe married women and widows (ages 18-40) were in munitions, &quot; other essential &quot;industries and the &quot; less essential &quot; manufactures. The number of single womenaged 18-40 in industry outside these groups was 695,000, of whom about&apos;500,000were aged 18-30. There was a balance of about 375,000 single women aged 18-40in the &quot;unoccupied&quot; classes and in private domestic service. Of the 725,000single women aged 18-40 in the &apos;&apos; other essential&apos;&apos; industries, 430,000 were in national and Local Government Service (para. 105).Estimated Requirements for Man-Power.   -22. For the period mid-1942 to mid-1943 it is estimated that the armed forces require something between a minimum of 524,000 and a maximum of883,000, excluding Army tradesmen, made up as follows : Minimum.        Maximum.110,000 162.000288,000 450,000126,000 271,000Total   .......      ...      524,000 883,000 (paras. 106, 107and 108).23. For the period mid-1942 to mid-1943 it is estimated that the Women&apos;auxiliary Services require between a minimum of 197,000 and a maximum of215,000 (paras. 109 and 110).24.   For the period mid-1942 to mid-1943 the estimated requirements on government work for munitions amount to about 191,000 men and 372,500women.  In addition, about 9,000 men and 109,500 women are required for civil defence and other industries and services, making a total estimated requirement&apos; Df about 200,000 men and 482,000 women (paras. 116 to 119).25. For the period mid-1942 to mid-1943 the total estimated requirementsof the Armed Forces, Civil Defence and Industry are between 764,000 anu1,123,000 men (including 40,000 Army Service tradesmen) and between 679,000and 697,000 women, making a grand total of between 1,443,000 and 1,820,000*(para. 121),Royal Navy ...ArmyRoyal Air Force
Estimated Supply under Existing Arrangements.26. Under existing arrangements the estimated resources to meet the-demands of the Forces for the period mid-1942 to mid-1943 amount to about.415,000 men (excluding 47,500 R.A.F. deferred service men and excluding ArmyService tradesmen) (para. 122).27. The deficiency in the supply of men for the Forces for the year amounts-to a minimum of about 109,000 and a maximum of 468,000. If the R.A.F.deferred service men are used to meet the R.A.F. deficiency, the total minimumdeficiency would be about 103,000 and the maximum 420,500 (para. 131).28.   The estimated resources to meet the requirements of munitions andother industries for the year amount to about a net 200,000 men (para.. 129).29. Provided the deficiency in the supply of men for the Forces is not tobe made&apos;up, existing resources should be sufficient to meet the estimated require-ments of men for munitions and other industries for the year (para. 134).30. The sources of supply of women for the Women&apos;s Services and for munitions and other industries and services would produce for the periodmid-1942 to mid-1943 about 505,000-140,000 for the Women&apos;s Services and365,000 for munitions, &amp;c. (including 30,000 for replacement of men recruited from munitions for the Forces) (paras. 152 and 153).31. The deficiency in the supply of women under existing arrangementsamounts to between 204,000 and 222,000 a deficiency of between 57,000 and75,000 for the Women&apos;s Services and of 147,000 for munitions and other industries and services (paras. 155 and 156).Additional Supply to meet Deficiencies.32. The field from which men can be obtained for the Forces can be extended by lowering the call-up age from 18^ to 18 and/or increasing the age beyond41 (421 ,at the 31st December, 1942) (para. 158).33. Under existing procedure the lowering of the call-up age from 18^to 18 would bring within the period up to June 1943 an additional 35,000. Ifthe National Service Acts were amended to enable boys to be registered andmedically examined before reaching the&apos; age of 18. this figure could be increasedto 70,000 (para. 159).34. If the call-up age were increased to 46 (47\ at the 31st December,1942), an additional 50,000 men would become available for calling-up for theForces (para. 160).35. The minimum deficiency in the Forces could be met by calling-uppractically all the fit men of military age in the building and civil engineering industries (para. 163).36. Only a fraction of the maximum deficiency in the Forces can be met from men&apos;taken from the &quot; less essential &quot; and the &quot; essential &quot; industries otherthan munitions, so that the full demands for the Forces cannot be met withoutwithdrawing men from the munitions industries (para. 164).. 37. It looks as if the &quot;less essential&quot; and &quot;essential&quot; industries otherthan munitions cannot contribute more than about 150,000 men, leaving to be meta balance on the maximum deficiency of something like 270,000 (para. 173).38. If the maximum deficiency in the Forces is to be met it would meanwithdrawing nearly one-third of all the fit men of military age in the munitions industries (paras. 174 and 175).39. So far from being able to lose workers the munitions industries require an estimated net increase of about 191,000 men and 372,500 women if the approvedprogrammes are to be carried out. The replacement by women of 270,000 menwithdrawn for the Forces for general service and, in addition, 40,000 ArmyService tradesmen, coupled with a net addition of 372,500 women, would mean a total increase in the number of women employed in munitions of nearly 700,000.It has taken two years to achieve an increase of this magnitude, a period in whichit was possible to obtain large numbers of mobile women from the &quot; less essential &apos;&apos; &apos;industries and the &quot;unoccupied.&quot; It is clearly impossible in existingcircumstances to achieve in one year anything like such an increase, so that, ifthe maximum deficiency of men in the Forces is to be met, the approved munitionsprogrammes cannot be fulfilled (paras. 176 and 177).
40. The field from which women can be obtained for the Women&apos;s Auxiliary-Services is limited not only by the range of age-classes called up but also by therestriction of the National Service Acts to single women, the option of going into-industry as an alternative to the Services and by the fact that very large numbersof single women have already been directed to vital war work on which theymust be retained (para. 178).41. This narrow field can be widened by lowering the call-up age from 20&apos;to 19, by extending the call-up from 23 to 30, by abolishing the option of going into industry and by amending the National Service Acts to apply to marriedwomen without children (para. 179).42. The lowering of the call-up age from 20 to 19 would probably produce20,000 women between January and June 1943. The extension of call-up toage 30 a measure already-announced would probably yield about 15,000. Thesetwo measures would go a long way towards making good the minimum deficiency of 57,000 in the Women&apos;s Services (paras. 180, 181 and 184).43. The abolition of the option of going into industry would have a serious effect on the supply of mobile women for industry already acutelyshort (para. 182)44. &apos; The application of the National Service Acts to married women without children is one of the matters referred to in the Markham Report on the Women&apos;services. It is difficult to estimate the number that would be produced by this measure, but there is little doubt that it would be substantial in relation to therequirements of the Services (para. 183).45. The existing sources of supply are expected to produce sufficient to meetthe estimated requirements of the munitions and other industries for men, butthere is likely to be a deficiency of about 147,000 women. This is apart from thevery large numbers of women that will be required to replace men called up forthe Forces (para. 185).46. The deficiency can only be met by withdrawals from the &quot; less essential &quot;industries, which will involve either the further curtailment of those industries or the replacement by immobile women from the &quot; unoccupied &quot; classes of mobilewomen withdrawn (para. 186).General Summary of Requirements and Supply.47. After adding in the requirement of about 40,000 Army Servicetradesmen, the maximum demands for the Forces, together with the estimated requirements for munitions and other vital industries and services, amount to atotal of 1,820,000 (1,123,000 men and. 697,000 women) (para. 188).48. There is no appreciable reserve of &quot;unoccupied&quot; men upon which todraw and in the long run, therefore, if the present standards and amenities of thecivil population. are to be fully maintained, the demands can only be met byrecruitment from the &quot; unoccupied &quot; women. Allowing for the fact that 200,000men to be obtained from the building and civil engineering industries would, not need to be replaced, and for wastage from the Forces, and the supply of men fromabroad, e.g. Italian prisoners, something like 1,500,000 women would have to be recruited from the &quot; unoccupied.&quot; This is nearly 80 per cent, of the numberrecruited from this source in the 3 years since the outbreak of war and is obviously an impossible task (para. 189).49. The &quot; less essential &quot; industries, therefore, would have to be cut downvery drastically, with the consequent lowering of the standards and amenities ofthe civil population, but it is unlikely that it would be practicable to takesufficiently drastic steps to produce anything like the numbers required for theForces and for the munitions and other vital industries and services (para. 190).50. The general conclusion is that, while it would just about be possible,to meet the requirements of the Forces if they were not making, increased, demands and provide the labour necessary to fulfil existing munitions programmes, thereare not now sufficient men and women to meet all the demands of the Forces andat the same time continue the expansion of munitions production according toprogramme and maintain the existing standards and amenities of the civilpopulation .(para. 191).[24649]
PART I.I.-Age Analysis of the Population Men and Women aged 14-64 inGreat Britain.1. The following Table gives an approximate age analysis of the populationaged 14-640 in Great Britain at mid-1939, mid-1941 and mid-1942: (Thousands)Date. 14-17.        18-20. 21-40. 41-64.

Since the outbreak of war the following changes have occurred : (1) The number of boys aged 14-17 has fallen by 131,000, and the numberof girls by 130,000. These decreases are due to the fall in the birth-fate between 1921 and 1928, which is having an important bearing onthe supply of young man-power for the Armed Forces, Women&apos;auxiliary Services, and for industry. Its effect is already seen in- the reduced numbers reaching military age and the age when labourbecomes fully mobile.(2) There are smaller decreases in the numbers aged 18-40. The number ofmen has dropped by 106,000, partly&apos;due to war casualties, and thenumber of women by 26,000.(3) The numbers aged 41-64 have increased by 301,000 (men by 135,000 andwomen by 166,000). Attention has frequently been directed in recentyears to the increasing numbers in the higher age groups of thepopulation. This is leading to an increased rate of wastage amongthe working population through invalidity and the higher death rate.(4) The total population aged 14-64 has fallen by 92,000; the number ofmen has decreased by 102,000, partly offset by a small increase, 10,000,in the number of women.(x) The figures for mid-1941&apos;and mid-1942 are estimates made in the Ministry of Labour and&quot;National Service. They may be subject to a margin of error, but this is not likely to be large^enough to invalidate the conclusions drawn from the estimates.SURVEY OF MAN-POWER-MID-1942.^Note. Ail the figures for mid-1942 are provisional and subject to revision.)
II. Distribution of the Population as between the Armed Forces, Civil defence and Industry.3.

These tables show that since the beginning of the war over 2\ millionpersons 650,000 men and over 1,900,000 women previously &quot; unoccupied &quot; orin private domestic service are now engaged in some form of employment or service for the country, and that during the last year [ended the SQth June, 1942)952,000 persons -52,000 men and 900,000 women have been mobilised from the&quot;unoccupied &quot; or private domestic servants. At ra^-1942, out of nearly 33^million persons of working age (14 to 64), over 22^ millions (15J million men and7 million women) were engaged in some form of employment or service for thecountry.6. . The great bulk of the men recruited; to the Armed Forces have been withdrawn from industry. About half the reduction of 3,000,000 men in industry has been made good by an increase of 1,537,000 women.   This increase, together[24493] i  c
with the increase of 306,000 women in the Auxiliary Services and 80,000 in fulltime Civil Defence has been made possible by a decrease in the &quot; unoccupied &quot;and private domestic servants. The reduction in the numbers in this section ofthe population is over 1,900,000. There has been a corresponding reduction amongunoccupied men of 651,000, of which 549,000 accounts for a net increase in thenumber of men in the Forces, full-time Civil Defence and industry. This increasehas been achieved in spite of the fall of 102,000 in the total number of men aged 14-64.7. Over 84 per cent, of the increase in the number of men in the Forces had occurred by mid-1941. In the year ended June 1942 the net increase of 507,000men in the Forces and full-time Civil Defence has been counter-balanced, by acorresponding reduction in the number of men in industry. This latter reductionhas been more than made good during the year by an increase of 677,000 women.Besides, this the number of women in the Auxiliary Services and full-time civil defence has increased by 224,000 and this combined movement has involved, the recruitment of 900,000 women during the year from private domestic serviceand the unoccupied.8. There is naturally a wastage from the population of working age due to death, invalidity, retirement from employment upon marriage among women,and the attainment of the upper age point. Wastage from these causes is made good by the flow into industry of boys and girls upon leaving school. the reductions in the numbers &quot; unoccupied &quot; referred to above have occurred overand above this normal movement.9.

Mobilisation of man-power had gone further towards the end of thethird year of this war than it had by the end of the fourth year of the last war.This is brought out by the following Table giving an estimated distribution ofthe adult population (men 14-64; women 14-59) at mid-1942 and in 1918.[24493] c 2

The proportion in the other essential industries is alsolarger (17-7 per cent, as compared with 15-3 per cent.) owing to the greaternumbers in National and Local Government. The numbers in the less essential industries and the unoccupied population represented 52-2 per cent, of the totalat mid-1942 as compared with 56-9 per cent, in 1918.11. Differences in the character of the two wars affect detailed comparison,particularly as between men and women. Greater mechanisation of the armed forces and, the larger programmes of factory building, aerodrome and campconstruction and repair of air-raid damage have made it necessary to retain agreater proportion of men in industry. Consequently, the Fighting Services and full-time Civil Defence included a smaller proportion of the male population at mid-1942 than in 1918. On the other hand, women have been brought directlyinto the war effort to a far greater extent. These points are brought out in thefollowing Tables for men and women separately :Distribution of Adult Male Population.(Men 14-64.  Great Britain only.)Mid-1942. 1918.Millions.    Per cent.

12. The Fighting Services and full-time Civil Defence absorbed 4,110,000men, or 25-8 per cent, of the total at mid-1942, as compared with 4,600,000, or34-1 per cent., in 1918. If casualties in both wars were included in the figures,the differences between the figures for 1942 and 1918 would be increased. On theother hand, the number of men in the munitions industries is now nearly 60 percent, greater than it was in 1918 and represents 21 per cent, of the male popula-tion of working age as compared with 15-7 per cent, in 1918. The FightingServices, full-time Civil Defence and the munitions industries now include7,440,000 men, or 46-8 per cent., as compared with 6,720,000, or 49-8 per cent., in1918. The number of men retained in essential industries other than munitionsis about 820,000 greater now than it was in 1918. These industries include26 per cent, of the adult male population as compared with 24-6 in 1918.13. In the case of women, 23 -1 per cent, of those aged 14-59 are now inthe Fighting Service, full-time Civil Defence and the munitions and other essential industries, as compared with 13-5 per cent, in 1918. The proportionin the Fighting Services and the munitions industries is nearly double theproportion in 1918 (13-5 per cent, as compared with 7 per cent.) and this increase represents about 1,160,000 women.IV.

These tables show that there has been a decrease of the total labour forcein industry between raw^-1939 and m*aM942 of 1,473,000, a decrease of 3,000,000.men being partly offset by an increase of 1,527,000 women.   They also show thatin munitions and other essential industries together there has been an increase of nearly 1,900,000 women.24. Over half the man-power for the Forces has been recruited from the less essential industries. &quot;While in certain of these industries a large proportion ofthe men thus withdrawn have been replaced by women, there has been, at thesame time, a very substantial transference of women from less essential industries to the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services and the munitions industries. Thenet effect on the industrial distribution of women is shown by the fact that although the total number in industry has increased since mid-1939 by 1,527,000the proportion in the less essential industries has dropped from 72-4 to 50-4 percent, (the number in the less essential industries has fallen by 362,000).(A) Munitions Industries.Changes mf^-1939 to mid-lM2.(e)25. At mid-1942 there were approximately 3,325,000 men aged 14-64 and1,780,000 women aged 14-59 in this group, making a total of 5,105,000. Thegroup included, at mid-1942, 28-8 per cent, of the total labour force in industry as compared with 17-2 per cent, at mid-1939.

The age group 18-40 represents a greater proportion of the total malelabour force in the munitions group than in either of the other two main groups.The comparative figures are as follows : Men 18-40.Per cent, of totalNumber.      14-64 in each growp.Munitions      ................   1,664,000 50-other essential industries......       ...      1,716,000 41-4Less essential industries    ...       ...       ...       1,220,000 33-6All industries       .........      4,600,000 41-430. It is estimated that there were in the munitions group 1,175,000 men aged 18-^-42^ (at the 31st December, 1942) who were medically fit for service with the Forces. This is 42-2 per cent, of the total number of fit men of thoseages in all industries. The great bulk of these men are in skilled occupations and they represented 35-4 per cent, of the total number of men aged 14-64 inthe munitions group.31. Women. Women now represent 34-9 per cent, of the labour force inthe munitions group as compared with 16 -1 per cent, at mid-1939.32. An approximate age analysis of the 1,780,000 women aged 14-59 atrnid-1942 is shown by the following Table : Per cent.A ge Group. , Number. of total.14-17 .........      ... 190,000 10-718-40 ...      .........      1,354,000 76 041-59 ...      ...      ...      ...        236,000 13-3Total ...      ...      1,780,000 100-033.

(B) Other Essential Industries.(Agriculture; mining; National and Local Government Service (excluding-Civil Defence); gas, water and electricity supply; transport, communication and fishing; food, drink and tobacco.)34. At mid-1942 there were approximately 4,144,000 men aged 14-64 and1,529,000 women aged 14-59 in the group, making a total Of 5,673,000.

These figures show that the number in this group of industries decreased by 362,000 between mid-1939 and mid-1941; an increase of 402,000 women beingoffset by a decrease of 764,000 men; but between mid-194+1 and mid-1942 thegroup increased by 135,000, there being an increase of 239,000 tvomen and adecrease of 104,000 men.39. Over the whole three-year period the withdrawal of men for the forces and losses from other causes in the group as a whole has been made good to theextent of nearly 75 per cent, by the intake of women. This process of replace-ment and expansion in the employment of women has been relatively greater duringthe past year than during the preceding two years, there having been an increaseof 239,000 women, while the decrease in the number of men amounted to 104,000.The experience in this respect among the constituents of the group is shown by the[24493] &apos; d

The outstanding features disclosed by the above table are  (1) An increase during the past year of 10,000 men and 36,000 women in.agriculture;(2) An increase during the past year of 109,000 women in the civil estab-lishments of Government Departments, with a decrease of only 9,000men. This very large increase of women accounts for nearly half thenet increase in the number of women in the essential industry group asa whole and has taken place in spite of withdrawals of women in theconscribed age-classes. During the three years mid-1939 to mid-1942Government Departments have expanded by 61,000 men and 300,000women.(3) In Local Government Service the decrease of 30,000 men during the past year has been more than offset by an increase of 32,000 women.(4) Mining, and food, drink and tobacco manufacture are the only industries in this group in which there has been a decrease in the labour force during the past year, and food, drink and tobacco manufacture is theonly industry in which there has been a decrease of both men andwomen.Men.41.

In the first two years of the war a large number of the men were replaced by women, andmany mobile women transferred from the industry have been replaced by immobilewomen. The net result is that the industry now includes the same number ofwomen as at mid-1939.76. Changes mid-1941 to mid-1942.

This is 7 - 0 per cent,of the fit men of those ages in all industries and 16 - 7 per cent, of the total numberof men aged 14-64 in the distributive trades. About 100,000 of these men were due to be called up under existing arrangements.79. Women 14-59.

The increase in the number of women is accounted for entirely bycommerce, banking, insurance and finance and professional services. In theformer a substantial withdrawal of men since mid-1939, equivalent to about50 per cent, of the total male labour force, has been partly counter-balanced bythe intake of women. This continued up to June 1942. In professional services the increase in the number of women is accounted for largely by the intake ofwomen into hospital service.

There,have been substantial&apos;reductions among both men and women in the other servicesincluded in the group entertainments, hotels, public-houses, restaurants, &amp;c,laundries and cleaning.86.

. .   89.   It is estimated that the group included about 76,800 men aged 18^-42^who were medically fit for service with the Forces.   This is 2-8 per cent, of thetotal number of fit men of those ages in all industries, and 14-5 per cent, of thetotal number of men aged 14-64 in the group.90. The number of fit men aged 18-1-42-! in each of the component services,with the percentage of all men 14-64 represented by this number, are asfollows : Per cent, of all menNumber. 14-64-Commerce,   banking,   insurance   and finance         ...      ...      ...      ... 18,100 11-2Professions      ...   -   ...      ...... 41,700 32-0Entertainments............ 8,500 15-9Hotels, &amp;c.       ...      ......... 3,700 2-4Laundries and cleaning        ...      ... 4,800 14-276,800 14-5The high percentage in the professions is largely accounted for by the retention incivil life of doctors, dentists and other professional men. The estimated numberof fit men in hotel, restaurant, &amp;c, service has been obtained by applying to thetotal reserved and deferred in that service the average percentage of rejection ineach age group for all industries combined. It is possible that these rates maybe too low in relation to hotel, &amp;c, service. If that is the case, the number of fit men actually left in that service is less than the figure given above.91. Women 14-59. Women aged 14-59 now represent 65 per cent, of thelabour force in the group, as compared with 60-3 per cent, at mid-1939.92.   The total of 978.000 women aged 14-59 in the group at mid-1942 is splitup as follows :-- -Number.

Numbers of Fit Men of Military Age in Civil Employment.95. Table 6 in Appendix I shows the estimated numbers of fit men ofmilitary age in various industry groups at mid-1942. Table 6a shows the numbersreserved and deferred at the 7th September, 1942, after taking out the men available for enlistment in the Forces under existing arrangements.96. Table 6 shows that at mid-1942 there were approximately 2,910,500fit men of military age (18-J-42^ at 31st December, 1942) in civilian employment(of whom 129,000 were in Civil Defence Services). This total included, 504,210men who were either available for enlistment or had been released from, the forces for- industry. - The remaining 2,406,290 were reserved or deferred at the7th September, 1942, and they represent the field for consideration in connectionwith the supply of additional men for the Forces. The total of 2,406,290 included876,320 who were below 31 years of age^and 1,529,970 31 years of age and over.[24493] . &apos; e 2
YIIL- Women.101. At mid-1942 there were 15,710,000 women aged 14-59 in the CivilPopulation. Of these 8,397,000 or 53-4 per cent, were in the age classes 18-40.The great bulk of the mobile women in the country are in this grotip.The following table gives an approximate age analysis of the group 14-59,distinguishing, separately single women and married women without children under 14 living with them : Women aged 14-59. in the civil population of Great Britain Mid-1942.Analysis according to age and marital state.Married and Widows.Age group.14-17 .18-2021-30 .31-40 .18-40 .41-59 .Total-14-59 .Single.1,368,000918.0001,354,000720,0002,992,0001,040,0005,400,000Withoutchildrenunder 14livingivith them.(say) 3,00085,000900.000700,0001,685,0002,000,0003,688,000Withchildrenunder 14livingivith them.(say) 2,00035,000-  1,315,0002,370,000 -3,720,0002,900,0006,622,000Total,Marriedand Widows.. 5,000120,0002,215,0003,070,000. 5,405,000- 4,900,00010,310,000.GrandTotal.1,373,0001,038,0003,569,0003,790,O0C8,397,0005,940,00015,710,000. [Note. The information available on which to base these estimates isincomplete. The figures may, therefore, be subject to a considerablemargin of error.]102. It is estimated that about 4,175,000 of the single women and 2,491,000of the married women and widows are in industry. Of the latter figure probablyabout 622,000 or 25 per cent, have children under 14 living with them. Of the,819,000 &quot; unoccupied &quot; married women and widows probably about 6,000,000have children under 14 living with them.103. The table above shows that of the 8,397,000 women aged 18-40 about,992,000 or 35-6 per cent, were single, and 1,685,000 or 20-1 per cent, weremarried women without children under 14 living with them, making a total\ of4,677,000 or 55-7 per cent.97. Of the 876,320 young (i.e. 18^-30) fit men, 78,830 were in the &quot; less essential&quot; industries, 335,630 in the &quot;essential&quot; industries other than munitions,441,860 in munitions, and 20,000 in Civil Defence.98. Of the 78,830 young fit men in &quot;less essential&quot; industries, 24,070were in building and civil engineering, 27,800 in the manufacturing industries(textiles, clothing, printing, pottery, &amp;c), only 12,390 in the distributive trades(mainly managers, butchers, &amp;c), 11,890 in the professions and 2,680 in commerce,banking, insurance and finance, entertainments, hotels, laundries, and cleaning.Of the 335,630 young fit men in the &quot; essential &quot; industries other than munitions,267,950 were in mining and agriculture, 45,020 in transport, gas, water, and electricity, and the food and, drink trades, and 22.660 in National and LocalGovernment Service (excluding Civil Defence).99. Of the 1,529,970 fit men of military age (i.e., up to 42^ at the31st December, 1942) 31 years of age and over, 334,240 were in the &quot;less essential&quot;industries, 582,260 in the &quot; essential &quot; industries other than munitions, 504,470in munitions, and 109,000 in Civil Defence.100. Of the 334,240 fit men of military age 31 and over, in the less essential industries, 103,800 were in building and civil engineering, 107,940 in the manu-facturing industries, 80,910 in the distributive trades, 19,680 in the professions,and 21,910 in commerce, banking, insurance and finance, entertainments, hotels,laundries and, cleaning. Of the 582,260 in the &apos;&apos; essential&apos;&apos; industries other thanmunitions, 287,080 were in mining and agriculture, 208,390 in transport, gas,water and electricity, and the food and drink trades, and 86,790 in National andLocal Government Service (other than Civil Defence).
104. At mid-1942 there were approximately 6,666,000 women aged 14-59in industry; of these 4,346,000 were in the age group 18-40. - The following table shows the estimated distribution of the 4,346,000 women aged 18-40 in industrydistinguishing separately single women from married and widowed : Women aged 18-40 in industry.Married andIndustry Group.

A bout 30 per cent, of the single women aged 18-40 and a third of the married women and widows were in the munitions industries. A bout 58 per cent,of the single women and 54 per cent, of the married and widows were in munitions and other essential industries. If the less essential manufactures are added the proportions rise to 74 per cent. The number of single women aged 18-40 outsidemunitions, other essential industries, and less essential manufactures was about695,000. It is estimated that about 500,000 of these are aged 18-30. The&apos;number of married women and widows in the same group was 446,000. Thebalance of 374,300 single women aged 18-40 not in industry will include some60,000 in Civil Defence, also private domestic servants and &quot; unoccupied &quot; women.Of the 725,000 single women aged 18-40 in, the other essential industries, 430,000were in National and Local Government Service (excluding Civil Defence).PART II.I.

The total number required for the twelve month sending June, 1943, will then be 215,000.111. The limits of requirements for women for the Women&apos;s auxiliary services are, therefore, 197,000 to  15,000.(B) Civil Defence.Release of Men and Women.112. The Civil Defence and Police Services are being reduced and thereare no demands for men. , At the 1st July, 1942, these Services included311,000 men and 80,000 women. A reduction in the personnel was approvedearly in .1942, and the number due to be released after the 30th June, 1942, wasabout 37,000 (29,000 men and 8,000 women), including 5,000 from the national fire Service.(It is being found difficult to place some of the released men and women in industry, and probably not more than 20,000 men &quot;and 4,000 women will beavailable from this source.)Estimated Requirements for-Women.113. Women substitutes are required to replace some of the men released and the estimated number required is approximately 13,000.(C) Industry and Various Services.114. Table 7 in Appendix II gives estimates of the net increase required on Government work in the shipbuilding and ship-repairing; non-ferrous metals;engineering, aircraft, allied metal goods; chemicals, explosives, oils, &amp;c,industries.115. Some increases will also be required in certain other industries suchas metal ore mining, the cotton industry and railway service..116.

The total net requirements of industry and certain civilian servicesthus amount to about 200,000 men and 482.000 women. (80,000 men are to be recruited, from munitions for the Forces under existing arrangements. It is assumed that 30,000 of these can be replaced by women. The total number ofmen required for industry is thus 250,000 and the total number of women is512,000.)(D) Summary of Estimated Requirements.120. The estimated requirements of the Armed Forces, Civil Defence andIndustry for the period July 1942 to June 1943 can be summarised as follows : Men. Women.  .Minimum.     Maximum. Minimum.

Also thefollowing requirements are likely to arise for women : Civil DefenceNursing, &amp;c. servicesWomen&apos;s Land ArmyRailwaysCottonOther ServicesTotal13,00032,00037,00012,0007,0008,500109,500119. The total net requirements of industry and certain civilian servicesthus amount to about 200,000 men and 482,000 women. (80,000 men are to be recruited, from munitions for the Forces under existing arrangements. It is assumed that 30,000 of these can be replaced by women. The total number ofmen required for industry is thus 250,000 and the total number of women is512,000.)(D) Summary of Estimated Requirements.120. The estimated requirements of the Armed Forces, Civil Defence andIndustry for the period July 1942 to June 1943 can be summarised as follows : Armed   Forces    (excluding   Army-Service tradesmen) ...       ...Civil Defence ...       ...       ...Industry        ...Total      ...      ...Men.Minimum.

This shows that between 724,000 and 1,083,000 men and between679,000 and 697,000 women are estimated to be required, making a grand totalof between 1,403,000 and 1,780,000 men and women, or between 1,443,000 and1,820,000 including Army Service tradesmen.II. Estimated Supply of Man-Power.(A) Supply under Existing Arrangements.Available Supply of Men for Armed Forces.122. Under existing, arrangements, the estimated resources to meet thedemands of the Forces amount to 270,000 for  the  6  months  ending  the
31st December, 1942, and 415,000 for the 12 months ending 30th June, 1943, made up as follows : Six months ending 31st December, 1942 Balance of  men  available  for  posting  at the1st July, 1942    .........       .......   75,000Individual deferment scheme and other resources ... 100,000First half of 1924 class      ......       .......95,000Total     ............ 270,000Twelve months ending the 30th June, 1943 Balance  of  men  available  for  posting  at  the1st July, 1942    ......      ......... 75,000Individual deferment scheme and other resources 150,0001924 class       .........       ...       ...... 190,000Total............      415,000123. Of the estimated supply of 415,000 for the 12 months ending June1943, 80,000 (who must be replaced) are estimated to come out of munitions,100,000 out of the other essential industries, and 235,000 out of the less essential industries.A vailable Supply of Men for Munitions and other Industries and Services.124. The supply of men for munitions, &amp;c, can only be obtained from thefour following sources : (1) wastage from the Armed Forces;(2) recruitment from overseas, including Eire;(3). - Italian prisoners;(4) transfer from other industries and services.125. Wastage from the Armed Forces. This amounts to about 94,000 ina year. All of these are not available for war work, as many of them are unfit,but so far as possible they are directed into munitions and other vital war workon discharge. The number obtained in this way for munitions in the year endingmid-1943 is not likely to exceed 65,000. One difficulty has not yet been overcome.Under the National Service Acts men called up to the Forces have the right ondischarge to reinstatement in their previous job, and it is therefore not possibleto direct men who wish to exercise this right into war work. This difficultycould be surmounted by making a Defence Regulation postponing the exerciseof the right to reinstatement.126. Recruitment from Overseas, including Eire. Recruitment from overseas is negligible and must remain so in view of the shipping position. Asregards Eire, recruitment has been proceeding at the rate of about 25,000 a yearnet. It is estimated that for the year ending June 1943 there will be an accession to the labour force in this country of 30,000 from this source.127. Italian Prisoners. The additional number of Italian prisonersavailable for the work covered by this memorandum is not likely to exceed 5,000.128. Transfer from other Industries and Services. The transferring ofmen from work of less importance to vital war work is a continuous process.The source from which the men are being obtained is the &apos;&apos; less essential&apos;&apos; group of industries. This includes the building trade, which, it is anticipated, willbe falling off substantially in 1943; it -is difficult to estimate the number thatwill be available for transfer to munitions and other vital war work, but it maybe somewhere about 50,000 out of the total of 890,000 men in the industry. Theother &quot;less essential &quot; industries will also be supplying a flow of men transferredto munitions and other vital war work. Men have so far been registered underthe Registration for Employment Order up to age 50 and are being interviewedand transferred. It is considered that it should be possible to obtain about80,000 men out of the total of 2f million men in these industries for transfer to munitions. It is also expected that about 20,000 will; be obtained from civil defence (see paragraph 112).
129. The above sources of supply under existing arrangements wouldappear to produce a net 200,000 men for the year ending June 1943, as follows :-Wastage from Forces ...      ... sayRecruitment from overseas ...Italian prisoners       ...       ...Transfer from Civil DefenceTransfer from building tradeTransfer from other less essential industriesTotal ...      ...      ...      ...Replacement of men recruited from munitions forthe Forces......      ...      ...      ...Net balance for munitions and other vital industries65,00030,0005,00020,00050,00080,000250,00050,000(8)200,000Summary of Supply Position of Men for Forces and Munitions.130.

Armed Forces. The deficiency in the supply of men to meet thedemands of the Forces is set out in the following tables : Six months July to December 1942.Resources ...      ...Minimum demands of ForcesSurplus or deficiencyMaximum demands oi.

// the R.A.F deferred service men were used to meet the R.A.F. deficiency, thetotal minimum deficiency woidd be 103,000 and the maximum 420,500.132. These tables show that the position up to the 31st December, 1942, is asfollows :- Navy. The minimum requirement can be met from existing resources,but there will be a deficit of 14,000 on the maximum requirement.Army. There will be a deficit of 15,000 on the minimum requirementand of 69,000 on the maximum requirement.R.A .F. The minimum requirement can be met, but there will be a deficit of 105,000 on the maximum requirement. This deficit would be reduced to57,500 if the deferred service list were drained completely.133.   The position up to the 30th June, 1943, is as follows : Navy. -There will be a deficit of 15,000 on the minimum requirementand of 67,000 on the maximum requirement.Army. There will be a deficit of 88,000 on the minimum requirementand of 250,000 on the maximum requirement.R.A.F. There will be a deficit of 6,000 on the minimum requirementand of 151,000 on the maximum requirement. The latter would be reducedto 103,500 if the deferred service list were completely drained.134. Munitions. Leaving out of account the possible withdrawal of menfrom munitions to meet the additional demands for the Forces it is anticipatedthat existing resources should be sufficient to meet the estimated requirementsof men for munitions and other industries for the year.Available Supply of Women for Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services.135. The number of women that can be called up to the&apos;Women&apos;s auxiliary services under the National Service Acts is limited by three factors : (1) the Acts only apply to single women;(2) women called up under the Acts are given the option of going into theServices or into Industry; and(3) very large numbers of single women have already been directed into vitalwar work under the Registration for Employment Order procedure.136. It is estimated that 40,000 women will become available under theNational Service Acts for posting to Women&apos;s Services during the period july to December 1942. As regards the requirements for January to June 1943, itwill be possible under existing arrangements to call-up under the National service acts only a relatively small number of women from the second half of the 1922class and of women in other age classes who may still remain available to becalled up.These will probably not amount to more than 10,000.137. The Women&apos;s Services consist mainly of volunteers. For the threemonths July to September 1942, about 33,000_ volunteers were recruited, whileabout 17,000 women were called up under the National Service Act. If this rateof volunteering were maintained it would be possible to meet substantially therequirements of the Women&apos;s Services to December 1942 otherwise under existing arrangements the demands will not be met. The rate of volunteeringhas, however, been falling off and it is estimated that a total of 90,000 volunteers for the year is probably the maximum that can be obtained.138. The estimated supply of women for the Wom,en&apos;s Services for theyear ending 30th June, 19A3, is therefore 140,000.139. Of this total, of 140,000 women, it is estimated that 12,000 will beobtained from munitions,(10) 16,000 from the other essential industries, 62,000from the less essential industries and 50,000 from the &quot;unoccupied&quot; includingprivate domestic servants.(10) This will be counterbalanced, so far as the requirements of the munitions industries areconcerned, by the transfer to munitions of 12,000 women discharged from the Women&apos;s auxiliary services.
8389A vailable Supply-of Women for Munitions and other Industries and Services.140. The supply of women for munitions, &amp;c, can only be obtained fromthe following two sources : (1) wastage from the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services;(2) transfer  from  work  of   less   importance  and   transfers   from  the&quot;unoccupied&quot; classes.141. Wastage from the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services.-Th.is amounts toabout 30,000 in a year. Probably not more than 12,000 of these are availablefor war work within a short period as many of them are unfit. Those suitableare directed to war work.142. Transfer from work of less importance. The transfer of women fromless important work to vital war work is continuing at a rapid rate. Duringthe year ended 30th June, 1942, the net decrease of women in the less essential industries was 231,000. This is, however, a process which cannot be carriedmuch further without a substantial curtailment of civilian services and amenities.143. Registration of Women under the Registration for EmploymentOrder. By the 5th October, 1942, women born in the years 1897 to 1923 hadbeen registered under the Registration for Employment Order, the total numberregistered having reached about 8,640,000. The majority of the women registeredare not available for recruitment to the Women&apos;s Services or for employment in industry, being either in war work already or married women with domesticresponsibilities.144. By the 5th September, 1942, out of 8,100,000 women registered,approximately 2 million had been interviewed by Local Officers of the Ministryof Labour and National Service and about 484,000 remained to be interviewed.145. Of the total of 2 million women interviewed 923,000 had been placedor had found work in industry or had been recruited for the Women&apos;s Services(including those recruited compulsorily under the National Service Acts). Inaddition 106,000 women had been classified, as suitable for transfer but had notbeen transferred. This makes a total of 1,029,000 women enlisted, placed orwaiting to be placed or enlisted.146. At the 5th September the number remaining to be interviewed out ofthe 1899 to 1923 classes was, as stated above, about 484,000. The numbers avail-able for interview from the 1897 and 1898 classes will probably not exceed76,000, making the total remaining to be interviewed from all classes due to be registered, under the existing arrangements about 560,000.147. A ssuming that the yield from, these older classes will be slightly lessthan the average yield from the 2 million already interviewed, it should amountto about 275,000 and this number, with the 106,400 from the earlier registrationswho were awaiting placing at the 5th September, should give a total of about380,000 women for employment in industry and services or enlistment in theWomen&apos;s Services.148. It is estimated that of the 380,000, about 332,000 will be available for industry and services other than the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services. Of the 332,000a considerable proportion will be immobile and not available for transfer to munitions, and it is estimated that it will not be possible to place more than about182,000 directly into munitions and other vital services.149. It is necessary also to take into account the numbers transferred to industry and services from the 1st July to the 5th September, 1942, in order to assess the numbers available for the year July 1942 to June 1943. These amountedto 187,000, of whom 117,000 went into munitions and other services.150. A special comb-out of women in the 1920, 1921 and the first half of the1922 age-classes is taking place, from which it is expected to obtain 30,000 ofthe 50,000 women to be called up under the National Service Acts. As women are given the option of going into industry instead of being called up for theServices, this comb-out should also produce about 30,000 women for munitionsor other vital war work.151. In addition women above and below registration ages are placed inwar work from the &quot; unoccupied &quot; classes and from less essential industries. Forthe year ending June 1943 these may amount to some 20,000.[24493] f 2
152. The above sources of supply under existing arrangements would appearto produce about 365,000 women for industry and services for the year ending the 30th June, 1943, as follows :  Wastage from Women&apos;s Services    ...       ...       ... 12,000Numbers transferred from  the 1st  July to  the5th September, 1942      ............ 117,000Transfer under Registration for Employment Order the 5th September, 1942, onwards &apos;     ...       ... 182,000Transfer from Civil Defence (see paragraph 112) ... 4,000Comb-out of 1920, 1921 and first half of 1922 classes 30,000Women above and below registration ages ...       ... 20,000Total.........      ... 365,000Replacement of men recruited from munitions forthe Forces.................. 30,000Net balance for munitions and other vital services ... 335,000Summary of Supply Position of Women for the Women&apos;s Services and munitions and other Industries and Services.153. The existing sources of siipply woidd appear to produce about 505,000women for the Women&apos;s Services and for munitions and other industries and services as follows: Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services        ...       ...       ...      140,000Munitions and other industries and services     ...      365,000Total      ......      ...      505,000154. Of the total of 505,000 women it is estimated that 12,000 should, beobtained from munitions (to be counter-balanced by 12,000 transferred to munitions &quot;upon discharge from the Forces) 30,000 from the essential industries and services other than munitions, 333,000 from the less essential industries and130,000 from the &quot; unoccupied.&quot;Deficiency in Supply of Women for Women&apos;s Services and Munitions.155. Women&apos;s Auxiliary. Services. The deficiency in the supply of women to meet the demands of the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services for the year ending the30th June, 1943, is as follows :-Minimum.        Maximum.Estimated requirements ...       ...       197,000 215,000  ,Estimated supply.........       140,000 140,000Deficiency      ......        57,000 75,000The deficiency thus lies between 57,000 and 75,000.156. The deficiency in the supply of women to meet the estimated require-ments of munitions and other industries and services is as follows : Estimated requirements      ...       ...       ...       ...      482,000Estimated net supply ...       ...       ...       ...      335,000Deficiency &quot;       .............      147,000There is thus a total deficiency of between 204,000 and 222,000.,(B) Additional Supply of Man-Power to meet the Deficiencies in Supplies for theForces and Munitions and other Industries and Services.Forces.&apos; 157. The general field from which man-power can be obtained for the forces is restricted by the range of age classes that can be called up and by the fact that,within that range, men and women must reach a minimum standard of fitness.158. The field from which men can be obtained can be extended by loweringthe call-up age from 18-^ to 18 and/or increasing the age beyond 41 (42-1 at tne31st December, 1942). Any men obtained by these means must, of course, comefrom industry or the &apos;&apos; unoccupied &apos;&apos; classes.
159. Lowering of call-up age of men from 18^ to 18. Under existing pro-cedure, if the first quarter of the 1925 class were proclaimed in April, this would bring within the period up to the 30th June, 1943, an additional 35,000. If, how-ever, the National Service Acts were amended to enable boys to be registered andmedically examined before reaching the age of 18, so that they could be called upimmediately they reach 18, this figure could be increased to 70,000.160. Increase in call-up of men above 41. If the call-up age were raised to 46 (i.e., 47^ at the 31st December, 1942) it is estimated that the additionalnumber becoming available would be about 50,000. This number is small, due tothe rate of medical rejection being much higher in these age classes and the pro-portion reserved and deferred being necessarily large. The Army do not wantmen in these higher age-groups. The R.A.F. are taking men up to 50 forsedentary duties, but they are obtaining them by voluntary recruiting.161. Paragraph 130 above shows the numbers of men that will be withdrawnfrom the munitions industries, other essential industries, and the less essential industries to provide the supply of 415,000 that can be made available under existing arrangements. Paragraph 131 shows that, after these men have been withdrawn for the Forces, there will still remain a minimum deficiency at the endof June, 1943, of 109,000, and a maximum deficiency of 468,000, If the R.A.F.deferred list were drawn upon to meet the R.A.F. deficiencies these deficiencieswould be reduced to 103,000 and 420,500 respectively. The question is what further numbers of men and women can be obtained from industry to meet these,deficiencies, and, if the deficiencies are to be met, what will be the effect on theindustries concerned f162. It is not possible to estimate the numbers that can be obtained from thevarious industries without a detailed consideration of the position of each industry and the extent to which concentration, or further concentration, can beeffected with its consequential additional restrictions on civilian amenities and standards.163. It should, however, be possible to withdraw sufficient men aged 18^ to42^ from building and civil engineering to meet the minimum deficiency.164. As regards the maximum deficiency, the governing factor is that thenumber of fit men of military age that can be taken from the &quot; less essential &quot; andthe &apos;&apos; essential&apos;&apos; industries other than munitions represent only a fraction ofthat deficiency and that, consequently, the full demands for the Forces cannot bemet without withdrawing men from the munitions industries.165. The last three columns of Table 6 in Appendix I show approximately the industrial distribution of the fit men of military age available as the fieldfrom which (apart from the extensions referred to in paragraphs 159 and 160above) the deficiencies must be made good.166. The numbers of such fit men aged 18^ to 30 and 31 to 42^ in each ofthe four main sections of the &apos;&apos; less essential 1&apos; industries group are approximatelyas follows : &apos;18%-30.        31-42%.Building and civil engineering      ...      ...     24,070       103,800Distribution    ...............     12,390 80,910Manufactures...............     27,800        107,940Miscellaneous Services (Commerce, banking,insurance, &amp;c, professions, entertainments,hotels, and laundries)      ...      ...      ...     14,570 41,590Total     ...      ...      ...      ...     78,830       334,240167. Building and Civil Engineering. In view of the anticipated reduc-tion of the industry, it should be possible to, take for the forces most of the fit men now in the industry. If 90 per cent, were called up this would produce a total of115,000, of whom 22,000 would be under 31 and 93,000 would be 31 and over. Thissupply would be sufficient to meet the minimum deficiency of 109,000. This wouldmake the total withdrawal from the building and civil engineering industries for the Forces from mid-1942 about 150,000. If 50,000 men were transferred to munitions the industry would still be left with a total male labour force of about690,000 (including about 560,000 insured men aged 16-64), This 200,000 wouldnot require to be replaced.
168. Distributive Trades. Out of a total male labour force at mid-1942 of1,161,000 in the distributive trades, only 93,300 fit men of military age remainedavailable for consideration in connection with the Armed Forces deficiencies,and these consisted almost entirety of key-men, such as managers, butchers, &amp;c..Only 12,390 were under 31 years of age. It is obviously not possible to obtainmore than a small further contribution from these trades.169. Manufactures. These include the cotton, wool, hosiery, clothing,printing, pottery and other concentrated industries, most of which have had their labour force reduced to a minimum. Out of their total male labour force of1,056,000 at mid-1942, only 135,740 fit men of military age were available forconsideration in connection with the Armed Forces deficiencies. These are allskilled men, many of whom are employed in the maintenance of machinery or asproduction key-men. It is unlikely that the numbers of such men .could bereduced still further by any appreciable figure.170. Miscellaneous Services. -Out of the total of 56,150 fit men of military age in the field for consideration in connection with the Armed Forcesdeficiencies, 31,570, or more than half, are in the professions and 15,230, or over one-quarter, are in commerce, banking, insurance and finance. The total number in entertainments, hotel and restaurant services, laundries and cleaning onlyamount to 9.360, and most of these will be skilled key-workers or maintenanceworkers. The labour force of this group of services has already been severelyreduced, and it is not considered that any appreciable further numbers can beobtained from them for the Forces.171. &quot; Essential &quot; Industries other than Munitions. Of this group, which includes a total of 917,890 fit men of military age available for consideration inconnection with the Armed Forces deficiency, 555,030, or over 60 per cent., arein agriculture and mining and 253,410, or 27-6 per cent., are in gas, water, and electricity, transport, food, drink and tobacco. No appreciable contribution forthe Forces -can be obtained from these groups.172. National and Local Government Service (excluding Civil Defence)had 109,450 fit men of military age in the field available for consideration inconnection with the Armed Forces deficiency. Their total male labour force is880,000 and they have an equal number of women. It is clear that, if the deficiency on the maximum requirement for the Forces is to be met, there mustbe a substantial recruitment from these two Services. If 90 per cent, of the fit men under 31 and 20 per cent, of those aged 31 and over were called up, 20,400young men and 17,400 men aged 31 and over, or a total of 37,800, would beobtained.173. From the foregoing it looks as if a contribution from the &quot;less essential&apos;&apos; industries and from &apos;&apos; essential&apos;&apos; industries other than munitions ofnot more than about 150,000 can be expected, leaving to be met a balance on themaximum deficiency of something like 270,000.174. Munitions Industries. The total number of fit men under 31 yearsof age available for consideration in connection with the Armed Forcesdeficiencies is about 442,000. In addition, there are 504,470 fit men aged 31 andover, making a total of just over 946,000.175. If the maximum deficiency in the Forces is to be met, it would,- asshown above, mean withdrawing nearly one-third of these men for the Forces,and obviously this could not be done without a very serious reduction in munitionsoutput. The bulk of the men are skilled workers. Men with similar skill arenot available from other industries to replace them. They can only be replaced by the upgrading and training of semi-skilled and unskilled workers now in the munitions industries and by further dilution, in which women will be substitutedfor men in the lower grades.176. So far from being able to lose workers the munitions industries -require an estimated net increase of 191,000 men and 372,500 women by the endof June 1943, if the approved programmes are to be carried out. The replace-ment by women of 270,000 men withdrawn for the Forces for general serviceand in addition 40,000 Army Service tradesmen, coupled with a net addition of372,500 women, would mean a total increase in the number of women employedin munitions of nearly 700,000.
177. It has taken two years (September 1940 to September 1942) to achievean increase of this magnitude, a period in which it was possible to obtain largenumbers of mobile women from the less essential industries and the &quot; unoccupied.&quot;It is clearly impossible in existing circumstances to achieve in one year any thing-like such an increase, so that if the maximum deficiency of men in the Forces isto be met the approved munitions programmes cannot be fulfilled. And evenif the numbers could be found it is obvious that munitions production must be seriously curtailed during the period of training and transference.Supply for the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services.178. The field from which women can be obtained for the Women&apos;services is limited not only by the range of age classes called up but also by therestriction of the National Service Acts to single women, the option of going into industry as an alternative to the Services and. by the fact that very largenumbers of single women have already been directed to vital war work and mustbe retained there if the munitions programme is to be fulfilled.179. The narrow field from which women can be obtained for the Women&apos;services can be widened by lowering the call-up age from 20 to 19, by extending the call-up age from 23 to 30, by abolishing the option of going into industry,and by amending the National Service Acts to apply to married women without children. Any women obtained by these means would, of course, come out ofindustry or the &apos;&apos; unoccupied &apos;&apos; classes.180. Lowering of call-up age from 20 to 19. At present women are notcalled up to the Women&apos;s Services under the age of 20, although women aged 19are regarded as mobile for the purpose of industrial transfer. If the calling-upage were lowered to 19 it is estimated that from the 1923 age-class (under theconditions governing the call-up from the present conscribed classes) 20,000women could be obtained for the Women&apos;s Services during the period January toJune 1943.181. Extension of call-up to higher age-classes. The age-classes 1918,1919, 1920, 1921 and the first half of 1922 have so far been called up. Theextension of the call-up to the age-classes 1917 to 1912, i.e., up to 30 years of age,would yield about 15,00,0. This is a measure which has always been anticipatedand already announced.182. A bolition of the Option to go into industry. At present womencalled up under the National Service Acts are given the option of going into theWomen&apos;s Services or into industry. About one-third opt for the Services,one-third for industry and one-third express no preference. Those who expressno preference are directed into industry in those areas where women labour is in short supply and are called up for the Services in other areas. The abolition ofthe option would have a serious effect on the supply of mobile women for industry already acutely short.183. Application of the National Service Acts to married women without children. This is one of the matters referred to in the Markham Report on theWomen&apos;s Services. It is difficult to make any estimate of the number that wouldbe produced for the Women&apos;s Services by amending the National Service Actsso as to apply to married women without children, but there can be little doubtthat it would be substantial in relation to the requirements of the Services.184. The measures outlined in paragraphs 180 to 183 would go a long-way towards making good the minimum deficiency of 57,000 in the requirementsof women for the Auxiliary Services.Munitions Industries and Miscellaneous Services.185. As shown in paragraph 119 above, the estimated numbers requiredfor tho munitions industries and for other industries and services for the yearended 30th June, 1943, are about 250,000 men and 512,000 women. As shownin paragraphs 130 and 152, the existing sources of supply are expected toproduce the men required, but not more than a total of 365,000 women are likelyto be produced, leaving a deficiency of 147,000. This is apart from the verylarge numbers of women that will be required to replace men called up for theForces.186. Only a small part of this deficiency can be met directly from the&quot; unoccupied &quot; classes since the numbers of such women who are mobile that willremain, after the recruitment already contemplated from existing sources of
supply from that class for the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services and for munitions,will be small. The deficiency can-, therefore, only be met by withdrawals from the&quot; less essential &quot; industries. This will involve either the further curtailment ofthose industries or the replacement by immobile women from the &quot; unoccupied &quot;classes of mobile women withdrawn.(C) Summary of Position.187.

the estimated requirements for munitions and other vital industries and services,amount to a total of 1,820,000 (1,123,000 men and 697,000 women).189. There is no appreciable reserve of &apos;&apos; unoccupied &apos;&apos; men upon which todraw, and in the long run, therefore, if the present standards and amenities ofthe civil population are to be fully maintained, the demands can only be met byrecruitment from the &quot;unoccupied&quot; women. Allowing for the fact that the200,000 men from the building and civil engineering industries would not need tobe replaced and for wastage from the Forces and the supply of men from abroad.e.g., Italian prisoners, this means that something like 1,500,000 women wouldhave to be recruited from the &quot; unoccupied.&quot; This is nearly 80 per cent, of thenumber recruited from this source in the three years since the outbreak of war.This is obviously an impossible task. Those that are left are mainly immobilemarried women, most of whom are only available for part-time employment, andeven the maximum employment of women on a part-time basis could only providea partial solution.190. The &quot; less essential &quot; industries, therefore, would have to be cut downvery drastically, with the consequent substantial lowering of the standards and amenities of the civil population, but it is unlikely that it would be practicable to take sufficiently drastic steps to produce anything like the numbers requiredfor the Forces and for the munitions and other vital industries and services.General Conclusion.191. From the conclusion reached in paragraph 177 and the above summaryof the position it will be seen that, while it would just about be possible to meetthe requirements of the Forces if they were not making increased demands and provide the labour necessary to fulfil existing munitions programme, there arenot now sufficient men and women to meet all the demands of the Forces and atthe same time continue the expansion of munitions production and maintain theexisting standards and amenities of the civil population.[24493]

Theage of reservation was raised by one year each month and the cases of the men sode-reserved came under review by the District Man-Power Boards. By the end ofJune 1942, 1,041,000 men had been de-reserved out of a total reserved at thebeginning of the year of 2,741,000. Applications for deferment were made in938,300 cases. In addition, the District Man-Power Boards had before them67,850 cases in which no application was made.The total number of men allocated to the Forces under the de-reservationscheme, including those in respect of whom no application for deferment had beenmade, was 58,800, or 3 - 5 per cent, of those de-reserved. In addition, the cases of265,600 men previously deferred on other grounds were reviewed and 25,300 wereallocated to the Forces, making a total for the six months of 84,100. These menwere subject to medical examination and the number available for enlistment was much smaller. The work of the Boards was necessarily slow in the early months,but by June arrears were being overtaken and men were being thrown up for theForces at the rate of about 18,000 a month.Of the total of 863,638 deferments granted by District Man-Power Boards,506,795, or 58-7 per cent., were in respect of employment in the munitions industries, and 194,218, or 22-5 per cent., were in respect of employment in vitalwar occupations in other industries. Among the remaining 162,625 cases defer-ment was granted for a limited period in 99,000 cases (33,274 for three months or less).In 10,708 cases where deferment was refused in existing employment the boards directed that the men should be considered for transfer to other work.
