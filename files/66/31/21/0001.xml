THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1942.SECRET. Copy-No.W.P. (42) 541.November 30, 1942.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER.REDUCTION OF NATIONAL GOVERNMENT STAFFS.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.1. DURING 1943 the demands of the Services and the munitions industries will impose an increasing strain on our man-power resources; and, among other sources of man-power supply, we shall have to draw substantially on the staffsengaged in National Government Service.2.   There are three main methods of reducing Government staffs : (a) by increasing hours;(b) by improving and simplifying methods of work;(c) by curtailing or suspending some of the services rendered by Departments.Government staffs are, in general, working a 51-hour week; and there is no room for any further substantial staff economy through increase of hours. Simplifiedmethods and procedure are being introduced; but the resulting economies in staffmature slowly and the numbers involved are not very great. The only way inwhich substantial staff reductions could be made quickly is through curtailment of some of the services rendered by the Departments.3. The existing staff of Government. Departments may be divided into threeroughly equal groups : Service and Supply Departments...      ...      210,000General Post Office......      ......      214,000O^ter Departments............      262,000In war time there is little scope for curtailing the services provided by theService and Supply Departments. In this group staff economy must be soughtmainly through pruning establishments and reorganising methods of work and procedure. It may also be possible to limit further expansion by arranging that new commitments are met by transfer of existing staff from less important work.I recommend that Ministers in charge of these Departments should be invitedto initiate a thorough overhaul of staffing arrangements (where this is not already in progress); to give their personal attention and support to measures for reducing staff by reorganisation and simplification of procedure; and to continueto impress on all concerned the vital need for securing the most rigorous economy in the use of man-power.4. In the second and third groups, substantial reductions of staff could besecured if some of the services now rendered by the Departments could be curtailed or suspended for the duration of the war..The Post Office alone might find it possible to release 20,000/25,000 men andwomen if the Government were prepared to require the public and industry toaccept a drastic restriction of facilities for postal and other communications.Similarly, in Departments in the third group, there must be many servicesnot vital to the prosecution of the war which could either be wholly suspendedor continued by smaller staffs on the basis of accepting a higher degree of[24662]
administrative risk. It is, for example, a matter for consideration whether atthe present time, when the shortage of man-power is so acute, we are justifiedin continuing to employ as many as 12,000 persons in postal and telegraph censorship.,.,; The suspension or curtailment of some of these services would involveinconvenience or hardship for the public, and to that extent would involve political considerations. I therefore suggest that a small Cabinet Committee should beappointed to review the position. This Committee might begin by asking all departments in the second and third groups what services would have to be curtailed, or what administrative risks run, if their staffs were reduced by10 per cent. In the light of the replies to this enquiry, the Committee couldconsider and report to the War Cabinet what reduction in services could beaccepted and what numbers of staffs could be released in consequence. Where the suspension or curtailment of a service would not involve important political considerations, the Committee could be empowered to authorise immediate actionin anticipation of the War Cabinet&apos;s approval of the general scheme.5. The total number of men and women in the Civil Service proper is686,000. There are, however, further numbers employed in quasi-Governmentorganisations who do not rank as Civil Servants, e.g., the staff of the B.B.C. andof County War Agricultural Committees.I recommend that the enquiry to be made by the Committee suggested in thepreceding paragraph should extend, not only to the Civil Service proper, but toall persons employed in National Government service.6. It was suggested in the Man-Power Survey that, in addition to a drastic reduction of Government staffs, there should also be some specific limitation on further recruitment. It seems doubtful whether it would be practicable toimpose such a limitation as a hard-and-fast rule. There are bound to be caseswhere Departments are asked to undertake new duties which they cannotdischarge without additional staff. On the other hand, it is necessary that recruit-ment of further staff should be kept to the bare minimum.  I recommend that (a) &quot;Ministers should be reminded of the need for practising the moststringent economy in the use of man-power in administration;(6) every legislative or administrative proposal put forward by Departments,either to the Treasury or to the War Cabinet or any of its Committees,should in future be accompanied by a statement showing what additional man-power, if any, would be required to operate it; and(c) at the end of each month any Department (including the Service and supply Departments) whose staff has increased during the monthshould be required to submit an explanation of the increase to theTreasury.7. Finally, I suggest that periodical progress reports should be made to theLord Presidents Committee on the increases and reductions in staff in the varioushranches of National Government Service.8. The Minister of Labour and the Chancellor of the Exchequer agree withthe recommendations made in this Memorandum.(Initialled) J. A.Great George Street, S.W. 1,November 30, 1942.
