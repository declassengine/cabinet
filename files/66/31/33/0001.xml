General Review.1.   Our submarines continue to operate successfully against enemy shipping on the supply routes in the Mediterranean.Two U-boats have been reported sunk.,    Shipping losses have been moderate.Northern Waters.2. The fourth of the independently routed ships from North Russiaarrived at Iceland (C) on the 24th.Some ships of a convoy from North Russia,, which was scattered by severe weather, arrived in Icelandic waters on the 26th.The Russian Ice-breaker Mikoyan (7,500 tons). reached the White Seafrom the Black Sea, which she left on the 3rd December, 1941, proceeding viaSuez, Capetown, Cape Horn, the Aleutian Islands and north of Siberia.Operations off French North Africa.3. H.M. Destroyer Bramham was bombed and damaged on the 20th, butarrived at Bougie. There were 8 casualties. Bougie was bombed on the 21stand two landing craft and 1,000 gallons of petrol were destroyed.Algiers harbour was bombed on the 20th and 21st. H.M. Cruiser Delhi was damaged but is seaworthy.   A smoke screen was successfully used on the 21st.The Trooper Scythia (19,761 tons) was torpedoed by aircraft on the 23rd offAlgiers, but reached port safely. The s.s. Aurora (1,695 tons) was bombed and sunk at Philippeville on the following day.Two ships, the s.s. Gzangeyark (5,132 tons) and Prinz Harold (7,244 tons)were sunk by U-boats on the 20th in a convoy to North Africa off Cape St. Vincent.The s.s. Zaan (1,800 tons), which was presumed sunk, has now arrived atOran.1. Twelve officers and 477 ratings from H.M.S. Manchester, who wereinterned in Tunisia, are now on their way home.5. In recent operations naval fighters destroyed 2 German and 3 Vichyaircraft, probably destroyed 2 and damaged 3.On the night of the 20th a Swordfish attacked a ship of 1,600 tons offMarittimo, but results were not observed.Mediterranean.6.   H.M. Submarines have reported the following attacks : P. &apos;221 torpedoed a 5,000-ton German ship off Bizerta on the 16th.P. 228 torpedoed an Italian destroyer of the Orione class (1937) in an attackon a convoy on the 21st.Turbulent sank a 4,100-ton escorted ship south of Sardinia on the 11th.P. 35 sank a 6,000-ton passenger ship north of Messina on the 17th.Utmost torpedoed a ship off Bizerta.P. 211 shelled and sank a brigantine bound for Tripoli (L) on the 13th andtorpedoed a 2,200-ton ship and a schooner off El Agheila on the 16th and 17th.On the 20th she sank a large L.C.T. ship loaded with petrol, and four other craftSW. of Benghazi.Porpoise sank the Italian s.s. Yacoma (739 tons) manned by Italian naval personnel bound for Tripoli on the 23rd.7. It is estimated that, during the week, some 14,000 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or seriously damaged by bur aircraft.Indian Ocean.8. Reference Resume No. 167, paragraph 14, the Dutch tanker Ondina hasnow arrived safely at Fremantle the Master, Chief Engineer and three Chineseseamen were killed.West Africa.9. On the 21st the U.S. Cruiser Milwaukee, when 700 miles SW. of Free-town, encountered a blockade runner, possibly the s.s. Anneliese Essberger (5,173tons), which scuttled when the cruiser appeared.   Some prisoners were taken.
Pacific.10. One other.U.S. destroyer has been lost, making a total of seven,, insteadof six, reported last week.The Japanese s.s. Africa Maru (9,476 tons) was sunk by a U.S. submarine inthe Formosa Strait on the 21st October:During the period 3 enemy destroyers have been sunk and one damaged byUS. aircraft off New Guinea.Anti^Submarine Operations.11. Thirty attacks by surface vessels and aircraft have been reported duringthe week.Aircraft from H.M.S. Victorious attacked a U-boat in the Blay of Biscay onthe 21st. As a result the U-boat was scuttled and five officers and 46 ratingswere taken prisoner.Four promising attacks were made: by H.M. Corvette Lotus on the 13th, andby a Wellington aircraft on the 19th in the Western Mediterranean and two by aircraft off Finisterre and Lorient.A belated report from.the U:S. states that the U.S. Destroyer Southard sank a U-boat in the Pacific on the 8th, and that an aircraft made a promising attack in the Caribbean on the 13th.Enemy Intelligence.German.12. There is no change in the disposition of the German Fleet.Admiral Scheer was seen at Swinemunde in the course of the week.Photographs of the raids carried out by U.S. aircraft on enemy U-boat bases in the Biscay area up to the 14th show that signs of disorganisation are apparent,though direct and important damage cannot be assessed.Italian.13.   There is no change in the dispositions of Italian heavy ships.Traffic from Italy to Tripoli (L) has decreased during the week; but there hasbeen a considerable increase in the traffic to Tunis and Bizerta, especially thelatter, which is being used as the main port for enemy reinforcements in this area.Japanese. .14. The total now claimed by the U.S. Navy Department to have been sunkin recent actions are 2 battleships, 6 heavy cruisers, 2 light cruisers and destroyers and to have damaged 4 heavy cruisers. One heavy cruiser has been seen recently at Rabaul. In consequence the Japanese are very short of reinforcements for their Naval Forces in the S.W. Pacific, particularly in heavycruisers.The Japanese are making great efforts to improve the airfield at Buka and much material is reported to have been landed there.V-boats.15. The last week has been a remarkably quiet period, and the effect hasbeen apparent of the withdrawal of some 20 to 25 U-boats from the Atlantictrade routes for operations in Gibraltar approaches and western Mediterranean.Owing to serious casualties during the past fortnight it is probable that not morethan 8 German U-boats are at present operating in the western Mediterranean,though a renewal of activity is to be expected shortly. There are still 8 &quot;or -9U-boats in the Western Approaches to Gibraltar, some of which may be entering the Mediterranean.There are, at present, about 90 U-boats operating in the Atlantic.Protection of Seaborne Trade.16. During the week ending the 22nd/23rd, 956 ships have been convoyed.Of these,* 163 were in ocean convoys and 793&apos; in British coastal convoys.   One[24674] . &quot;&apos;:     &apos; &apos; &apos; . &apos; v
anti-aircraft ship, 64 destroyers (including 3 U.S. destroyers) and 67 sloops,cutters and corvettes (including 4 U.S. cutters), have been employed on escort duties.During the week 70 ships in 3 ocean convoys arrived in home waters without loss.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the week ending the 21st totalled 449,000 tons, compared with an average of 682,000 tons for thepast ten weeks. Of the week&apos;s imports 178,000 tons were mineral oil of variousgrades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.17. Exclusive of the operations off the North Africa coast, U&quot;-boats haveattacked 12 ships, of which 6 are known to have sunk. In an outward-bound convoy one ship was sunk and two others torpedoed south of Newfoundland.One ship was torpedoed in Northern Waters in a homeward-bound convoy fromRussia. A ship sailing independently was torpedoed south of Newfoundland andone was sunk east of Barbados. Four ships were torpedoed off Durban. ^ In theIndian Ocean a ship was torpedoed off the south-west coast of India, andthe s.s. Tilawa (10,006 tons), carrying passengers^ was sunk south-east of Socotra;641 survivors have been rescued and 263 are missing.British Minelaying.18. During the week mines have been laid by aircraft in the Baltic, off theDutch and French coasts and in the Bay of Biscay.Aircraft also laid some mines off Tunis and Bizerta.Enemy Minelaying.  British Minesweeping.19.&quot; So far as is known no minelaying by E-boats or aircraft has occurred during the week in Home Wafers.The mine totals are : 2,726 magnetic, 1,329 acoustic, and 1,844 moored mines.During the air-raids on Algiers and Bougie, minelaying is suspected.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.20. The ex-Norwegian oil refinery ship Solglimt, 12,246 tons, which was believed to have been destroyed during air attacks on Cherbourg during Septemberhas recently been seen in dry dock.The three German tankers in Vigo are showing considerable activity whichmay indicate an early departure..Black Sea.21. There are indications, such as the salvaging of ships.at Feodosia andNikalaev and the stopping, or delaying of some supply convoys for fear of losses,that the Axis are anxious about their shipping in the Black Sea. A considerable and increasing amount of tonnage is needed to meet the normal supply require-ments Of the German forces in South Russia.The position has been aggravated by casualties inflicted by the Russian AirForce, Naval light forces and submarines operating against the Germans in theCrimean and Taman peninsula areas from advanced bases at Tuapse and Sochi.Vichy French Intelligence.22. The French naval losses in the recent operations have been established as follows :  .Mediterranean-One contre-torpilleur, 3 destroyers and 1 escortship sunk or damaged.  Ten submarines are not accounted for.Moroccan Coast. The battleship Jean Bart hit by four 16-inch shellsand two bombs, one turret serviceable; the cruiser Primauguet beached and. abandoned, 2 contre-torpilleurs wrecked and beached, 1 damaged; 4destroyers sunk, 3 damaged; 3 submarines sunk, 1 scuttled, 1 beatehed and7 unaccounted for.
(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)The Russo-German Campaign.Northern and Voronezh Sectors.23. The Russians have gained local successes in the Leningrad area andsouth-east of Lake Ilmen. They have also resumed their attacks in the Voronezharea.Middle Don Sector.24. The main event of the week has been the&apos;launching by the Russians ofa powerful offensive in this sector. The offensive has consisted of a double thrust-a thrust southward from Kletskaya and another in a west-north-westerlydirection from the area some 10 miles south of Stalingrad. The thrust&apos; fromthe north, directed against a part of the front which, it would appear, was heldlargely by Roumanian forces, has penetrated in places to a depth of some 75 milesand has reached almost to the junction of the River Chir with the Lower Don.The thrust from south of Stalingrad reached in its early stages to Kalach.Subsidiary progress has also been made immediately west of Stalingrad andsouth-westward beyond Abganerovo. As a result the German forces east of the don have been deprived of their main means of communication- the two railway lines running to Stalingrad from the west and the south-west and are in a highly critical position.Caucasus Sector.25. Continued bad weather has impeded operations. West of Ordjonikidze,however, the Germans remain on the defensive, while from Tuapse to Novorossiskpositional warfare in the mountains continues.Summary. *26. In their first major effort of this winter the Russians have won a markedsuccess, due in part perhaps to the inadequacy of the German mobile reserve.They have struck at the weakest part, strategically, of the German front the salient projecting along the length of the Upper Don to Stalingrad. If theRussians can extend their advance in the direction of Rostov, the position ofthe whole German force in Caucasia might be threatened.Libya.27. From the 18th to the 24th the pursuit of the enemy has been continuedfrom Derna to the El Agheila position. There are some indications that the remnants of the enemy forces, together with any reinforcements he may have succeeded in bringing up, may make at least a temporary stand in this area^The pursuit during the period under review has been undertaken in two parts.-Our light armoured formations have swept round the coastal road as far asBenghazi, whilst a heavy armoured formation has followed the more&apos;direct route to Jedabya via Msus and Antelat.28. On the 19th our most northerly light armoured column had reached apoint 20 miles east of Barce. Between Slonta and Martuba 28 German and Italiantanks, 24 guns of all types, and 250 motor vehicles were captured or destroyed.On the 20th Barce was occupied and some prisoners taken, and our light armoured forces pushed on to Tocra and El Abiar. On the 21st our light armoured forma-tions were slowed up in their advance along the Tocra-Benghazi and Barce-El Abiar roads by extensive mine-laying, but reached Benghazi on the 22nd. Onthe 23rd the Barce-El Abiar-Benghazi road was open and some of our infantryarrived in Benghazi.29. Further south the strong mobile column which had.reached Msus bythe 17th, and- was supported by a heavy armoured formation, then some 45 milesfurther east, had by the 18th encountered enemy resistance, composed of infantrysupported by about 30 Italian tanks, in the area Seeleidima-Antelat, and pushingon reached the Magrun area on the Benghazi-Jedabya road with patrols. Theenemy resistance on the Seeleidima-Antelat line did not materialise, and on the19th this position was reported clear, whilst the mobile screen of the supporting.[24674] . B 2
-otal      ...      ...      1,472 29,764 31,236French North Africa.Dakar.32. Admiral Darlan on the 19th held a conference at Algiers with threeFrench Officers from Dakar from which he emerged confident that Dakar would join the Allies. His confidence has been justified by events, the authorities at dakar agreeing on the 23rd to co-operate with the Allies. M. Boisson, Governor&apos; of Dakar, has been invited to a second conference at Algiers to set the seal upon this agreement.Tunisia-Algeria.: 33. As a result of further orders from Admiral Darlan and general giraud&apos;s, French troops have taken up their positions alongside the Allies, andGeneral Giraud, after a tour of the forward areas, has been convinced that theywould fight. Further, it is reported that the French troops are preparing to operate under the command of General Anderson.34. On the 18th, a German column from Bizerta made its first attack onDjebel Abiod which was held by the Allies. &quot;We repulsed the attack, inflictingheavy casualties on the enemy and knocked out eleven Pz. K.W. IV tanks for theloss of five 25-pdr. and some anti-tank guns.35. Further south, patrols from British parachute troops at Souk El Arbahave been active towards Mateur and Medjes El Bab, and their presence isreported to have given considerable encouragement to the local French forces.36. Light elements of our forces on the 20th destroyed a further 11 Germantanks in renewed enemy attacks on our positions some 15 miles to the west ofMateur, and on the 22nd, British forces repulsed a second German attack ontheir positions at Djebel Abiod, taking 40 prisoners.37. On the night the 20th/21st, enemy motorised patrols from Gabesthreatened Gafsa, which had been occupied by a small American parachute force from Youks Les Bains, with the result that the American forces withdrew thefollowing day to Feriarua, some 20 miles to the north-west. A little later, however,the Americans, supported by French units, counter-attacked, reoccupied Gafsaand are now pushing their patrols south-east towards Gabes.General Anderson has been building up a striking force as far as the limita-tions of transport and communications allow, but there has necessarily been apause while he concentrates his force and ensures the smooth working of hislong, lines of communications.The enemy is attempting to interfere with the unloading of supplies at themain ports by persistent air attacks, but little damage has been done anddischarging has been proceeding satisfactorily.armoured formation was directed on Jedabya. Benghazi was occupied on the20th by our armoured cars moving up from Magrun area and patrols were pushedout to Benina; a number of prisoners, mostly Indians, were released. Bad goinghandicapped the advance of the mobile screen to our heavy armoured formationdirected on Jedabya, and there was occasional contact with enemy armoured car patrols south of Antelat, whilst the main armoured force moved intothe area north of Antelat. On the 21st contact was made with the enemyimmediately north-east of Jedabya. By the 22nd it appeared that the enemy was thinning out from Jedabya, leaving a screen of tanks and A.Tk. guns ona line about 4 miles to the north of Jedabya. Our mobile detachments were in position to the south-west of this position. On the 23rd our heavy armouredformations entered Jedabya without opposition.30. Despite demolitions earned out by the enemy, the railway to Bir-el-Hamed was repaired by the 20th, and Tobruk was in use on the following day.Reports concerning the damage to Benghazi are not available in detail, but theeffect of bur own bombing and certain enemy demolitions have been considerable.31. Although there are undoubtedly many thousands of enemy prisonersstill to reach the base camps,&apos;the following was the position at the 18th : Officers.        O.Rs.

AIR SITUATION.General Review.42. Daylight raids were carried out against Lorient and St. Nazaire and, at night, strong forces of bombers attacked Stuttgart and Turin.In the Mediterranean successful attacks were made on enemy shipping.Heavy bomb raids were made on Tripoli (L), Bizerta harbour, and onEl Aouina airfield.United Kingdom.43. . Fighter Command flew 451 defensive sorties by day, and 164 by night.Only one enemy aircraft flew over this country in daylight.   For the. thirdweek in succession there have been no enemy aircraft over this country by night.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.44. Fighter, Bomber and Army Co-operation Commands despatched 400,11 and 20 offensive sorties respectively, compared with 540, 15 and 6 last week.In addition, ten U.S. fighter sorties and 134 U.S. bomber sorties were flown on similar operations.Port installations on the west coast of France were attacked by U.S. bombers.Eleven Fortresses raided Lorient in unfavourable weather; a ship in harbour isbelieved to have been hit. A total of 38 Fortresses and Liberators bombedSt. Nazaire; a tanker was probably hit and,, generally, the results are believed to have been good. In combat, U.S. air-gUnners accounted for 16 enemy fighters destroyed, three probably destroyed and six damaged. Four U.S. bombers didnot return and one crashed. Diversionary fighter sweeps and escorts to these operations involved 22 squadron sorties; they were uneventful.Railways in occupied territory provided targets for our fighters and fighter-bombers ; three locomotives were destroyed and 11 damaged. Enemy troops weremachine-gunned and casualties inflicted.The Photographic Reconnaissance Unit made 38 sorties and a further fivephotographic sorties were flown by aircraft of Army Co-operation Command.French Morocco.38. Further reinforcements have arrived and the unloading of stores hasbeen carried on without incident.Pacific Zone.South- West Pacific.39. Three Allied columns are closing in on the well-organised Japanesepositions in the Buna area. The southern U.S. column has reached CapeEndaiadere, 2 miles east of Buna, and is astride the main Kokoda-Buna road,1 mile to the west of Buna. A subsidiary airfield has been captured and the mainairfield is under fire. An Australian column from the south-west, having over-come stiff Japanese resistance at Soputa, 6 miles W.S.W. of Buna, is approachingSanananda, the main landing beach 4 miles N.W. of Buna. Another Australiancolumn captured Gona on the coast 11 miles N.W. of Buna on the 22nd and isnow directed on Sanananda.40. The Japanese have made repeated efforts to reinforce Gona-Buna bytroops transported in warships, but apart from 2,000 reinforcements landed atGona on the night&apos; 17th/18th their efforts have been frustrated with severe lossby Allied air action. The estimated Japanese strength in the Buna area is4,000.South Pacific.41. It is reported that 0,000 Japanese troops landed on Guadalcanal onthe 14tih. TJ.S. forces on the island estimate the Japanese strength at 25,000,including the above reinforcement. There are, however, indications that theJapanese have suffered heavily in the recent fighting, are much disorganised, andin many cases greatly reduced in strength. Morale is said to have suffered as theresult of sickness, Allied air and artillery attacks, a shortage of rations and lackof ammunition.
Night.45. A force of 222 Lancaster, Halifax, Stirling and Wellington bombers were despatched on one night to attack Stuttgart, main junction for armament traffic between Germany and Italy, as well as a highly-specialised production centre,with important engineering works including those of Daimler-Benz and Bosch.Despite a film of cloud over the target, visibility, through gaps, was moderate togood; totals of 129 tons of H.E. bombs and 215 tons (including 8 x 4,000 lbs.)of LBs. were released. A large concentration of fires was seen in the centralarea and others were started in the vicinity.  Ten of our aircraft are missing.Eleven Intruder aircraft operated over France and Belgium.Northern Italy.46. A total of 232 home-based bombers flew to Turin; 85 per cent, attackedtheir objectives and 185 tons of H.E. bombs (including 53 x 4,000 lbs.) and170 tons of LBs. were released, in cloudless weather. . Lancasters, Halifaxes,Stirlings and Wellingtons bombed the city, while a force of Lancastersconcentrated on the Fiat Works. Accurate Pathfinder flares illuminated the townthroughout the attack, though, as the raid developed, the &apos; target became soshrouded in smoke that results could no longer be seen. No artificial smoke screenis suspected. Fires, many of which were of considerable size, were concentrated in the heart of the city. Owing to drifting smoke from the town, the Fiat factorywas difficult to identify. A fire was, however, seen in the works and several bombs are known to have fallen in the target area. We lost three aircraft on this operation and two crashed.Coastal Operations.47. Coastal Command despatched 646 sorties, of which 214 were on anti-U-boat operations and 32 on convoy escorts. Bomber Command despatched64 sorties on patrols in the Bay of Biscay zone. Results of anti-U-boat activityare summarised under &quot;Naval Situation.&quot; Aircraft operating under fighter command flew 435 sorties on shipping-protection patrols and 125 sorties, ofwhich eight were by U.S. aircraft, in offensive operations against coastal shipping.Off The Hague, torpedo-carrying Beaufighters, operating under coastal command, hit two ships (6,500 tons and 1,500 tons) and an escort vessel, forming part of a convoy of about 14 ships; four of the attacking force did not return.Hudsons bombed a convoy off the Hook of Holland, hitting a 2,000-ton ship andprobably damaging two others. A 2,000-ton supply ship was torpedoed amidshipsby a Hampden off the Norwegian coast.Aircraft of Fighter Command damaged a 750-ton ship and another of1,000 tons in the Knocke-Dunkirk area. Near St. Nazaire, a trawler was leftstationary after being machine-gunned by a Liberator.A total of 102 aircraft, of which one is missing, laid 215 sea-mines in enemy waters.Mediterranean.French. North A frica.48. Our Air.Forces based on Malta and French North Africa concentratedtheir attacks on enemy airfields and harbours in Tunisia, and on the interception of transport aircraft and shipping.In daylight two attacks were made on the airfields at El Aouina (Tunis)and one on Bizerta by U.S. Fortresses escorted by Lightnings. Ten enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground, five others were probably destroyed and20 were damaged; in combat five Me. 109s were shot down. A successful attack was also made on Bizerta by 12 Bisleys, but four of these aircraft, failed toreturn. -U.S. Lightnings operated in the Gabes/Sfax area from Tebessa and destroyed 15 aircraft on the ground or in the air, 12 of which were Italian troopcarriers.At night, Wellingtons from Malta and Bisleys from the mainland bombed-the docks at Bizerta and bursts were observed along the water-front, across thequays, on the marshalling yards, and one 4,000-lb. bomb hit oil tanks and starteda large fire. The airfield also was successfully attacked, and hangars, barracks and runways were hit.   Eight Beauforts dropped mines in the harbour.
Beaufighters from Malta, two of which are missing, flew armed reconnais-sance patrols between Sicily and North Africa against transport aircraft, and shot down 14 enemy aircraft, including one B.V. 222.The harbour and airfield at Bone was attacked on two occasions, and tenSpitfires were damaged or destroyed on the ground and two were shot down in combat; eight enemy aircraft were shot down. Algiers was also attacked and five of our aircraft were destroyed on the ground, but little damage was caused to the harbour and shipping. The scale of enemy effort increased towards theend of the week, and intense enemy activity was reported against roads in theMedjes El Bab/Beja areas.Malta and Sicily.49. During the week our aircraft flew 618 sorties, including those flowninto Tunisia, compared with 404 last week.On the 19th, long-range fighters sighted the incoming westbound convoy and thereafter during the period of berthing and unloading continuous patrols were maintained and enemy aircraft were prevented from making any attack. at night, intruder patrols by Beaufighters were flown over Sicilian airfields toprevent enemy aircraft from taking off, and effective bombing raids were made,by Wellingtons. After one attack the airfield at Catania was cratered to suchan extent that it was rendered completely unserviceable. In daylight, raids weremade by escorted Spitfires carrying bombs.Reconnaissances were made of enemy ports, airfields and of shipping.Attacks on Enemy Shipping.50. The following successful attacks were made on enemy shipping by aircraft based at Malta :  .A direct hit was obtained amidships on a ship of 2,000 tons off Kuriate, whichwas left sinking.&quot;A ship of 1,500 tons east of Cape Bon was torpedoed by a Wellington andsubsequently sunk by one of our submarines.   ,,   -North-west of Ustica a ship of 7,000-8,000 tons was torpedoed. When lastseen it was stationary and down by the stern.Beaufighters obtained a hit with a bomb on a ship of 3,000 tons N.W. ofMisurata and also attacked her with cannon and machine-gun fire.51. Two enemy ships were blown up when entering Tunis Harbour, possibly by mines Laid by our aircraft.Gibraltar..52. Two hundred and twenty-two anti-U-boat patrols and convoy escortsorties were flown. Sixteen sightings and eight attacks on U-boats were made.Aircraft from French North Africa made three other attacks. Further details are in the &quot; Naval Situation.&quot;Libya. .53. Allied aircraft flew 1,132 sorties compared with 1,650 in the previousweek.  Operations were considerably restricted by adverse weather conditions.Offensive patrols were maintained over our forward troops, and shipping-protection patrols, were flown off the coast of Cyrenaica as far west as Benghazi.Transport aircraft carried supplies to our advanced military units. enemy activity was on a small scale and few encounters were reported.Tripoli (L) Harbour was bombed once in daylight and twice by night. the damage included the total destruction of the largest warehouse on the SpanishQuay and the partial destruction of three other warehouses. A ship was seenemitting smoke and low in the water.Crete.54. On the night the 23rd/24th a heavy attack by Wellingtons andHali faxes was made on the airfields at Heraklion and Kastelli Pediada. Lowclouds hampered observation of results, but bursts were seen in the dispersal area and at least ten fires were started. -Russia.55. In the Leningrad and Stalingrad areas the Russian Air Force fully supported the land forces.
Heavy German bombing attacks were made on Tuapse and aerodromes inthe vicinity. Attacks were made by close support forces against the Russianspearheads north-west and south of Stalingrad, but air operations wererestricted by bad flying conditions.The Russians claim that during the week ending the 21st November theGermans lost 60 aircraft against 66 of their own.Since the beginning of October it is estimated that some 400 aircraft ofall types, a large proportion of which are long-range bombers, were withdrawnfrom the Russian front to the Mediterranean area.Pacific Zone.56. In New Guinea, strong forces of Bostons and Mitchells repeatedlyattacked enemy positions in the Buna area and at Sanananda Point; the airfield at Lae was raided on three occasions and several barges were sunk nearby.Off New Guinea, a Japanese naval force engaged in landing operations was bombed by Fortresses; one destroyer was sunk. A light cruiser and four destroyers were attacked in the same area, two of the destroyers being sunk andanother damaged.In the Solomon Islands area, the airfield at Buin was raided. Fortressesset fire to a 10,000-ton transport west of Ysabel Island. The U.S. Navy Depart-ment reported that Fortresses hit two enemy cargo ships in the Buin area andthat, on one day, at least 14 Japanese aircraft were destroyed. Subsequentphotographs of this area disclosed an enemy destroyer beached and partiallysunk and a transport beached and burning.,HOME SECURITY SITUATION,57.   No bombs have been dropped on land during the week.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week : Italy.Turin.Information concerning the first of the two recent attacks that on the18th/ 19th November is as follows : The damage seen has been caused almost entirely by H.E. and is centred inthe Mirafiore district to the south (where the principal Fiat Works is situate)and in the western and south-western parts of the town. These districts areamong the more industrialised parts of the town and a number of factories andindustrial buildings have been damaged.   The principal features are : (i) The Fiat- Works ( Mirafiore).-A large workshop (360 yards by &quot;155 yards) has received two direct hits, one destroying the roof overan area of 95 ft. by 50 ft. damaging the framework, the other causinga hole 50 ft. by 40 ft. Three buildings in the transformer andswitching station have been very seriously damaged. The worksrailway station is partly destroyed and railway tracks and buildingsto the west of the works have been damaged.(ii) State Railway Workshops. Damage to a 13-bay building and blastdamage to the roof of the main building and a shed destroyed.(iii) The.Fiat Works (Corso Ferrucci): The roof lights of the main work--   shop have been blown out and the roofing of a large shed destroyed atthe north end.(iv) Cascina Lutino (Furniture Removers and Depository). FTalf of a largebuilding entirely demolished.(v) In addition, damage is seen at two wire works, a foundry and printing-machine works, to sheds on the aerodrome at Mirafiore and to theLancia Works.(vi) Among the public buildings damaged are the agriculture experimentalstation and the electrical institute.(vii) Damage has been caused to a number of workmen&apos;s dwellings in thevicinity of the Fiat Works, Mirafiore, and to residential, office andshop property in the parts of the town affected.A reliable source gives the following account of the second attack, on the night of the 20th/21st November. The attack was undoubtedly the heaviest so farexperienced in Italy. The population lost their nerve, and throughout the next day and night there was a panic^va^uatiom f rom the city. The authorities couldnot restore order until the 23rd November. Damage to industry was heavy and anumber of houses and shops were &quot;destroyed in the centre of the town.Casualties were high and the railway services, with few exceptions, wereinterrupted for a period of nearly 48 hours. In the opinion of the informant this attack was the first that created panic on a large scale, and the morale of theauthorities and the population was seriously affected thereby.Damage to industry included : -(a) Further damage to the Fiat Works at Mirafiore, where the heavy motorsection suffered most.(b) Damage to the engine section at Lancia&apos;s.(c) Severe damage to the Michelin works and to S.P.A. (now taken over byFiats). ,id) Artificial silk works suffered from fire and two military barracks were severely damaged, in one of which all the motor transport, consistingof 50 lorries and many motor cycles, were rendered useless.An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the 24th Novem-ber, 1942, confirms that extensive damage was caused to the town. There aretwo areas of devastation, one of 40 acres and the other 22 acres.
Milan.Since the daylight attack on Milan five Italian fighters at various intervalsduring the day have flown over the city, for the sole purpose of restoring confidenceamong the populace, who had been badly shaken by the complete unpreparednessof their city&apos;s defence on the occasion of the daylight attack. Feeling has been caused by the fact that while the homeless were accommodated in local schoolswith nothing else but straw to lie on, when certain high German officials visited the city accommodation could be found for them in hotels and private houses.Germany.Bremen.A reliable source reports that the output of the Lloyd Dynamo works (makersof electrical equipment, mainly for the Navy) has fallen by 33 per cent. Thisis attributed largely to the activity of the R.A.FOccupied France.Lille.A reliable source reports that, during the attack of the 9th October by;U.S. Fortresses, the power station at Fives-Lille was hit and was rendered unservicable for at least six months. Because of this, the entire plant was shutdown for two days until emergency measures had been taken and power supplied from other sources. It was not possible to resume normal production at thefactory for two weeks. Complete repair to the damaged boiler works will requiretwo months.St. Nazaire. &apos;photographs show that as a result of the attack by TJ.S. aircraft on the14th &quot;November the Machine Shop of the Chantiers et Ateliers de Penhouetreceived at least two direct hits. The Plate Shop and Mould Loft was ag&apos;ain hit(this time at its eastern end), the U-Boat Pens received at least six direct hitsand several small sheds, adjacent to dry dock No. 3, were destroyed. There werenear misses to a floating dock and a large merchant vessel which is under construction on the slips.In a second attack on the 17th November the following supplementarydamage was inflicted : (i) In the Chantiers et Ateliers de Penhouet *(a) The Machine Shop has suffered two more direct hits, doing furtherextensive damage to the roof.(b) The Paint Shop and an adjoining shed have been destroyed.(c) A direct hit at the southern end of the Rivet Shop has caused thedestruction of an area of over 22,000 square feet.(ii) A floating dock has one end submerged and is listing heavily, probablyas the result of a direct hit.(iii) Several quayside buildings have been hit and partially or whollydestroyed.   One of these is possibly part of the Munition Store.(iv) Both the passenger and goods stations at the railway terminus havereceived direct hits.(v) There are about 10 fresh craters on the main railway tracks.Sea-mining.The efficacy of recent sea-mining in the southern part of the Bay of Biscayis illustrated by a report showing the decline that has occurred in the shipment of iron ore from Bilbao to the ports of Bayonne and Bordeaux. In August therewere 131 departures but in September only 55.
