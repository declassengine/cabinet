THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENT-Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 532.November 19, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.&quot;THE FOUR-POWER&quot; PLAN.Note by the Lord Privy Seal.1 agree with the view expressed by the Foreign Secretary in his document^as to proceeding upon the basis that in the period after the war thefour Powers must take the lead in international affairs and that we must there-fore try to develop amongst the four Powers a common outlook on some, at least,of the principal problems of world reconstruction.As a first step towards this attempt to develop a common outlook it is essentialthat we should ourselves have a clear idea of what it is we want the four Powersto do, and along what general lines we would like them to proceed.The proposals put forward by the Norwegian and Dutch Governments foran &quot; Atlantic Group,&quot; or those put forward.by Stalin to the Foreign Secretary in moscow of a strong Britain and Russia dominating a Europe of small States,including a partitioned Germany, go much further than the Four-Povver plan.-They are, indeed, based upon a supposition that the major Powers will acttogether, but they suggest the direction that common action could take.We must therefore, I suggest, be prepared to decide on broad lines the major matters in which we think the four Powers ought to be prepared to actand the direction which that action should take. Anything short of this willnot give us a sufficient guide in any decisions we are asked to arrive at by theother Powers, and will also put us into the position of following them instead of leading them.There is already a sufficient effort in America to create an impressionthroughout the world that we are about to embark after the war upon a periodof American leadership in international affairs. The American century propa-ganda and all the subtle economic imperialism of the Republicans is liable to&apos;strengthen this impression unless we are ready with ideas and prepared to leadwith them.I therefore set out below the main points of such a programme, not upon anidealistic basis, but one that would, I think, gain general acceptance in thiscountry, and would also form a hopeful basis for negotiation with the other three members of the four-Power group.1. The most dangerous and therefore the most important area with which todeal is Europe. It has in the past been the originating cause of the worst wars,,and it must be dealt with if we are to have any prolonged period of peace.* W.P. (42) 516.[24643] .
2. Europe is the concern of all four Powers, but primarily of Russia, GreatBritain and America.3. Russia, Great Britain and the United States must all participate in thepacification of Europe.4. The major danger in Europe is the strong central position of Germany;with her large population and highly developed industries. Germany must notbe permitted to build up a fresh aggressive policy after this war.5. The immediate problem after the war will be the reconstruction of those territories which the Axis have pillaged and destroyed.6. No financial indemnity should be demanded of Germany and Italy, since this would only embarrass the United Nations in the long run. Reparationsshould take the form of repair and replacement of this pillage and destruction.7. The ultimate safety Of Europe will depend upon Germany being lesspowerful economically while her neighbours are more powerful.8. The system of small client States for which the major States compete isa continual source of rivalry, friction and danger in Europe. This can only begot over satisfactorily by (i) Bringing these small States together into larger federal units;(ii) Building up the economic power of these units so as to make themless dependent on Germany or any other great Power.9. For a period of years after the war and until some international system can be worked out to take its place, the four Powers (or the three primarilyinterested in Europe) will have to establish a policing system to maintain order and to prevent the building up of aggressive forces.10. This will entail a general measure of disarmament throughout Europe,the complete disarmament of the defeated Powers, and the setting up of an Air.Force and Naval policing system.11. It is to be hoped that gradually this would develop into an internationalworld police force.12. A Council of Europe would be established to deal with political, economic-and social issues (including minority issues) which were likely to disturb thepeace of Europe. This Council would presumably take over at the end of tlheimmediate post-war period the policing and reconstruction functions of the four powers.13. As a corollary to the pacification and policing of Europe it would benecessary to establish some means by which changes in boundaries, &amp;c, can takeplace without recourse to war.14. Great Britain, United States and Russia would all be members of thisCouncil.15. As large a measure of free exchange and freedom of travel and move-ments of commodities across frontiers as possible would be the economic aim. ofthe four Powers.16. In connection with the setting up of the Air Police Force it would benecessary as far as possible to internationalise European Air Transport and theinternational connections to and from Europe.   It.would be desirable to consider- in tlhis regard the possibility of the internationalisation of all forms of transportwithin Europe.17. The problem of Africa (so far as it does not consist of sovereign States,i.e., South Africa and Egypt) would have to be dealt with in association with europe, of which it is very largely an economic dependency.18. The American continent is primarily the concern of the american countries and the Pan-American Union would no doubt establish close contacts with the Council of Europe.19. In the Far East, China would have the principal concern, but all three other Powers are vitally interested.20. In this area a, Council of Asia should be built up with China as theleading figure.
21. The British Commonwealth of Nations has its Imperial conference which would be in close touch with the three other councils.22. Owing to the great size of the Soviet Union and its multiplicity ofrepublics, the Supreme Council of the U.S.S.R. would be recognised as one of thefive world councils which would thus consist of the following : European.American. .Far Eastern.British Commonwealth.Soviet Union.23. These five bodies would be represented on a supreme world council.24, These proposals have been sketched in rough outline, but they dependfor their validity on the clear determination of the tasks which the various bodieswould have to perform, thus avoiding the difficulties which the League of Nationsfaced in attempting an all too comprehensive and ill-defined responsibility.R. S. C.Gwydyr House, Whitehall, S.W. 1,November 19, 1942.
