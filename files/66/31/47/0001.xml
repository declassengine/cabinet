THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Wjar Cabinet.   December 1942.\SECRET.W.P. (42) 567.December 7, 1942.Copy No,    3 2TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SERVICE  REQUIREMENTS.Note by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.1. THE man-power and raw materials shortage makes it absolutelyimperative to ensure that the requirements of the Service Departments are not inexcess of needs. The following instances and there may be others raise doubt-as to whether this has been fully realised : (i) We had in stock in this country on the 1st October 100,000 tons ofobsolescent 500-lb. G.P. bombs and 22,000 tons of 250-lb. G.P. bombs.Expenditure between the 1st July and the 1st October averagedroughly 600 tons a month of the former and 70 tons a month of thelatter. Assuming that we continue to drop this obsolescent type ofbomb at the same rate, we had, therefore, on that date about 14 years&apos;supply of the 500-lb. type and 30 years&apos; supply of the 250-lb. type in stock. Abroad we had about 20,000 tons of the 500-lb. bombs and18,500 tons of the 250-lb. bombs. Expenditure appears to be about400 tons a month of each, so that abroad we had something like 4 years&apos;supply.Although 33,000 tons of our home stocks of the 500-lb. bomband 12,500 tons of the 250-lb. bomb are listed as &quot; tactical reservesagainst invasion,&quot; the total quantities do not seem to justify produc-tion at the rate which has until recently been going on, namely about.000 tons a month, requiring about 4,000 tons of steel. It appearsthat the Secretary of State for Air has recently stated that he wantedno more of these bombs, but apparently production has not yet been stopped.[24663]
It is, of course, true that the Air Ministry hoped for a biggerexpansion of the R.A.F. than has actually been possible, but should they not have stopped the output of this obsolescent type of bombmuch earlier ?(ii) We have a total world-wide stock of 75 million rounds of gun ammunition; expenditure on the Western Front in 1918 was 65 millionrounds. Planned production in the United Kingdom next year is70 million rounds, 100,000 tons of steel are allocated monthly to shellsand at least 400,000 people will be engaged on their manufacture.(iii) Of  the  ammunition  stocks   6-85  million  rounds  are  3-7  A.A.ammunition. The highest expenditure in any one month of the blitzon England was 140,000 rounds, at which rate our present stocks areequal to 50 months&apos; supply. Our planned production in 1943 is310,000 rounds per month,(iv) The War Office plan to issue 9^ million suits of battle dress in 1943.We have produced more than 22 million to date, and are making about450,000 per month,(v) Greatcoats are normally reckoned in the Army to last 4-^ years. Wehave made 8^ million to date, and are producing at the rate of90,000 per month. The War Office plan to issue 3 million greatcoatsin 1943!Desirable as it may be to have a smart, well-turned-out Army, itmust be remembered that all the 40 million civilians get only about thesame amount of wool and cotton as the Services and are to be allowedonly about the same amount of labour for converting the stuff intoclothing.2. The general stringency is now such that the Services can no longer have all they would like, but must be content with what we can afford. I proposethat the Minister of Production should investigate in broad general terms withthe various Departments what would be the effect on the efficiency of the services concerned if the rate of production of all items in the Ministry of Supply savea few obvious items such as tanks, 17-pdrs., A.T. ammunition, were cut down byone-third, and how much man-power and materials and ship tonnage would thereby be saved in the Ministry of Supply. A similar investigation should bemade as regards the output of items other than ships produced by the admiralty and other than aircraft produced by MA.P. In this investigation it might beassumed that all G.P. bombs should be stopped completely. These investigationswould cover both operational and non-operational requirements (e.g., clothing).Naturally, small bottleneck items should not be dealt with in these surveys.The investigation should proceed on broad general lines with a desire to discoverthe amount of man-power and materials and ship tonnage which could be set freefor the Services by reducing their equipment.W. S. C.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,December 7, 1942.
