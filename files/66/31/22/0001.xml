Si       1^2       ui^.  138THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  November 1942.6 (CONFIDENTIAL.Copy No. -W.P. (42) 542.November 24, 1942.WAR CABINET.REFORM OF THE FOREIGN SERVICE.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I warmly approve the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals for the Reform of theForeign Service,^ based upon the fusion of the Commercial, Diplomatic and consular Services with the Foreign Office and Diplomatic Service. I have taken a continuing interest in this problem since I served in the Foreign Officetwelve years ago, and am sure that this will be a most salutary change.2. I have had correspondence with the Foreign Secretary on some points ofinterest to the Board of Trade; and I am happy to put on record that we havereached agreement on all but one. In particular, the Foreign Secretary has agreed that the methods of recruitment for the Trade Commissioner service should be identical with those for the Foreign Service, and that the practice ofinterchange of personnel should be maintained. As my colleagues know, theTrade Commissioner Service is, within the British Empire, the. equivalent of theCommercial Diplomatic Service in foreign countries. The system now proposedwill make it possible, in spite of the very limited size of the Service, to providegood men to fill the posts, and men with a desirable variety of experience.3. The point, however, on which the Foreign Secretary and I do not agreeis the method of selection for the higher Commercial Diplomatic posts. TheCommercial Diplomatic Service is now administered by the Department of overseas Trade, for which the Foreign Secretary and the President of &quot;the Boardof Trade have a joint responsibility. It is important, in my view, that the Boardof Trade should retain, so far as the Commercial Diplomatic Service is concerned,this measure of influence. It is also desirable that this should be. explicitly statedin the White Paper. Otherwise, the commercial community, who are accustomed to look primarily to the Board of Trade for help and guidance in the conductof their business, both at home and overseas, may be gravely disturbed at theprospect of a &quot; New Order&apos;&apos; wherein the Board of Trade might seem to haveno part.4. I think this point should be covered in the White Paper, in order to forestall awkward questions in debate, and I, therefore, ask my colleagues toagree that in paragraph 26 there should be added after &quot; higher appointments &quot;the words  &apos;&quot;Because of the amalgamation of the Commercial Diplomatic services with the new Foreign Service, the Board of Trade and the Department of overseas Trade will be represented on the Promotions Board when the higherappointments to Commercial Diplomatic posts are under consideration, andsuch appointments will be made by the Foreign Secretary in agreement withthe President of the Board of Trade.&quot;H.
