THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  November 1942.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (42) 528.November 17, 1942.WAR CABINET.CENTRAL PLANNING AUTHORITY.Joint Memorandum by the Minister of Works and Planning and the paymaster-General.ON the 11th February last a statement was made in both Houses ofParliament to the effect that the town and country planning duties of theMinister of Health in England and Wales would be transferred to the Ministerof Works and Buildings, who would become Minister of Works and Planning;that in order to provide the necessary co-ordination with other Departmentsinterested in the use of land, he, and the Secretary of State for Scotland, wouldbe assisted by a committee of Senior Officials of the Departments concerned, andthat questions which could not be settled by this committee would be dealt withby a committee of Ministers under the Minister without Portfolio, subject, where necessary, to reference to the War Cabinet.2. This announcement met with a critical reception, mainly because it seemed to take too narrow a view of planning. Apart from the fact thatMr. Greenwood was at that time also Chairman of the Committee on reconstruction Problems, no ostensible provision was made for linking upplanning and the use of land with the general economic policy of the Government.3. The need for such co-ordination was strongly pressed in a report presented by Lord Samuel (as Chairman of an Advisory Panel) to the Ministerof Works and Planning in July and again in the reports which appeared shortly afterwards from Lord Justice Scott&apos;s Committee on Land Utilisation in RuralAreast and Mr. Justice Uthwatfs Committee on Compensation and Betterment.:]:All three reports agree that after the war it would be desirable to have a committeeof the Cabinet, presided over by a senior Minister, to survey and plan thegeneral economic policy of the Government, and that the application of thispolicy in the various spheres of Government should be the responsibility of theseveral Departments concerned. All three reports further agree as to the urgency of a national and positive approach to the problem of planning the best use ofthe land, involving more active control and initiation by the central government.They differ, however, as to the machinery to be used in applying the general economic policy of the Government in this sphere.4. Whereas the Scott and Uthwatt Reports recommend that this responsi-bility should rest upon a permanent commission, responsible to the senior minister who is to preside over the. proposed Cabinet Committee, Lord Samuel wasemphatic that a matter so vitally concerning the whole nation in all its interestsshould be under the direct control of Parliament, exercised through a Ministerof Planning. Parliament has already passed an Act providing for the transferof the duties of the Minister of Health under Town and Country Planning Actsto a Minister of Works and Planning. $5. The issue as between a Minister primarily concerned with planning anda statutory commission has been the subject of debate, in the Lords and of carefulf Cmd. 6378.[24635]* House of Lords, Hansard, cols. 752-4.House of Commons, Hansard, cols. 1531-3.$ Cmd. 6386. g Minister of Works and Planning Act, 1942.
review by the Reconstruction Problems Committee, Emphasis has been laid by those favouring a commission on the desirability of continuity of policy, of removing the control of the use of land from the political arena and of making such control as acceptable as possible to the interests concerned, particularly thelandowners. And the arguments in this direction have been intensified since theUthwatt Committee recommended the acquisition by the State of the whole of therights of development in undeveloped land outside built-up areas. On the otherhand, it is difficult to contest the fundamental point made by Lord Samuel thatin a matter of this kind Parliament, no less than the local authorities, will insist on the direct responsibility of a Minister, and, in order to ensure that thatMinister is able to give the attention and the drive which are demanded, it wouldseem essential that the control of the use of land should be his primary responsibility.6. After careful review of the arguments as between a Minister of planning and a Commission, the Reconstruction Problems Committee recommendthat the responsibility for control of the use of land, whether exercised throughthe town and country planning schemes prepared by local authorities or other-wise, should be the primary function of a Minister of Planning with a separateDepartment, the principle of Ministerial responsibility to Parliament being fully maintained. In addition, however, they take the view that there shouldbe a Commission to assist the Minister in connexion with the ownership and management of development rights (if it is decided to accept the recommenda-tion of the Uthwatt Committee that these rights should be acquired) and withany other work the Minister may refer to them from time to time. It might befound possible from time to time to assign to the Commission functions of aquasi-judicial character in connexion with planning. It might be possible to entrust the Commission, if suitably constituted, with the management ofproperty taken over by the State as the result of war requisitioning and nolonger required by the Department for which it was requisitioned, or with themanagement of National Parks. While it is desirable in the Committee&apos;s viewto provide an the same announcement for a Minister of Planning with a separateDepartment, and for a Commission to assist him in his work, they think it wouldbe better not to attempt to define too closely the allocation of functions betweenthem, but to leave this matter to be worked out subsequently.7. As regards Scotland, the Reconstruction Problems Committee haveagreed that, in accordance with the statement of the 11th February, the Secretaryof State should exercise in Scotland the powers of any Minister of Planning, andthat the question whether or not any Commission should operate in Scotlandrequires further, consideration in the light of the different government machinery of that country.8. It is obvious that questions concerning the best use of land may depend upon major issues of policy and may give rise to departmental differences whichcan only be settled at the highest level, i.e., by the Cabinet itself. No final con-clusion as to the method of dealing with these matters was arrived at by theReconstruction Problems Committee, as they felt that this was entirely a matter for the War Cabinet.9. The exact terms of the announcement embodying the decisions of theWar Cabinet will be submitted for the approval of the Prime Minister, and a-statement should be made at the same time in both &quot;Houses of Parliament. It willnot be possible to make this statement in the course of the debate on the Scottand Uthwatt Reports which is taking place in the House of Lords onWednesday and Thursday of this week, but, as regards the Commons, it is^proposed that the Paymaster-General should embody it in his general survey of reconstruction.P.W.
