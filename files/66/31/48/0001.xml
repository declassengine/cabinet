THIS DOCUMENT.IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJE.STY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1942.MOST SECRET. Copy No.-&apos;W.P. (42) 568.December 9, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.REPORT BY THE MINISTER OF PRODUCTION ON HIS visit to AMERICA.MANY of the agreements and arrangements we have hitherto made with theUnited States have not been carried out in practice. This is, chiefly, becausethey were imposed on the United States Services without full discussion. the changing nature of war and of the strategical situation gave excuses and some-times justifiable excuses for not carrying, out the letter of such agreements.Experience has shown that, unless our needs are fully known and accepted as reasonable by the American Services themselves, American commitments are nota solid foundation on which to build our own production programme.I, therefore, determined at the outset of my mission to discuss all the subjectsclosely with the Services and only to ask the President to intervene where our vitalneeds were not being met. This led to long discussions and required a greatdeal of patience; but I think it can be claimed that the present arrangements are accepted, with good will by the American Services and that they have everyprospect of being carried out. We can therefore plan our own production withsome assurance that the complementary supplies and aid of all kinds which we need from the United States will be forthcoming.2. As .a consequence of the method outlined above, the Presidents letter(Annex) does not deal, with detail, although I think it will be seen that the undertakings which it gives are both comprehensive and. precise. I give belowsome further information to my colleagues so that they may see the background to the letter.Shipbuilding.3. I found on my arrival that the proposed increase of over 2 million dead-weight tons in the-merchant shipbuilding to a total of 18,800,000 dead-weighttons for 1943 was far from being assured and was still the subject of keen contro-versy. It was being resisted by the United States Navy Department on theground that it would interfere with the construction both of escort and of largernaval vessels such as. cruisers. Sir Arthur Salter and I accordingly had discussions with Admirals Land and Vicary, who were both emphatic that theycould build 20 million tons of merchant ships in 1943 without encroaching on other programmes, if they were given the materials. After an examination bythe W.P.B. of the prospective bulk steel supplies, which were said at the time tobe the limiting factor, the programme of 18,800,000 tons was agreed.&quot;I pressed the President to increase this to 20 million dead-weight tons andhe has expressed his intention to raise the objective to this figure if, after-examination, it should prove possible. The United States Navy then shiftedits ground and claimed that the bottleneck would be machine tools.. Mr. Nelsonand Mr. Wilson&apos;were both sure that the machine tool difficulty can be overcome.The  Navy  then expressed  fears about some of  the  ancillary machinery,,[24725] - b
instruments, electrical equipment and so forth.   There are certainly some points at which the increased shipbuilding will clash with other programmes, but Ibelieve that the enquiry which the President has ordered will remove the&quot;obstructions and that a programme of 20 million tons will be achieved in an orderly way.There are proposals to build a higher proportion of 15-knot vessels. this may reduce the total tonnage; but, having regard to the lower rate of losses tobe expected from the faster ships, quicker turn-round from independent sailingsand the greater carrying capacity at long term, I feel that a moderate reductionin total tonnaere on this account should be accepted as sound.Utilisation of Ship-ping.4. The next subject dealt with by the President is utilisation of shipping and it will be seen that the commitment taken is comprehensive in character. Themandate from the Cabinet enjoined me to obtain the use of a maintained tonnageof 2,500,000 d.w. tons over 1943 (in addition to the aid already given). these instructions could not be interpreted literally, since that amount of tonnage isnot available to-day and, if it were, could not be manned all at once. Suchan excess of building over sinkings could only arise much later in 1943.The first step was to get the figure of 27 million tons of imports agreed by independent American authorities. Chiefly through the efforts of Mr. Harriman,a document* was signed by Mr. Wickard, the Secretary of the Department ofAgriculture, by Mr. Nelson of the W.P.B. and by Mr. Harriman agreeing thatthe figure was justifiable, but adding that all possible economies should be examined and. effected. Though no precise estimate can be made, this figure of27&quot;million tons of imports probably represents little more than one-third of thetotal tonnage to be carried in order to sustain the war effort of the BritishCommonwealth, military and civil. I tried, at the instigation of Sir ArthurSalter and Mr. Lew Douglas, to get the White House to accept a formulaby which British nett shipping losses as from the 1st August, 1942 would bemade up -from the nett gain in American shipbuilding. This was refused. Ithink, however, that the undertaking now given which is based on our needs is better in principle. The wording of the undertaking in the Presidents letteris : &quot; Accordingly, I am instructing our Shipping Administration to allocatethrough the machinery of the Combined Shipping Adjustment Board enoughdry-cargo tonnage out of the surplus shipbuilding to meet your imports, thesupply and maintenance of your armed forces and other services essential to maintaining the war effort of the British Commonwealth, to the extent that theycannot be transported by the fleet under British control.&quot; The President gives the Prime ^Minister the specific assurance that &quot; from our expanding fleet you maydepend on the tonnage necessary to meet your import programme.&quot;The calculation that the allocation of an additional 300,000 tons of shippingper month will be needed, was supplied to me by the M.W.T. The qualificationwhich deals with the military necessities of the United States is merely a state-ment of the fact inherent in war that in a crisis ships may have to be diverted to military purposes; but the sentence in the part of the letter dealing withshipping on which I wish to lay most emphasis states that any important diversion of tonnage will only be made with the Presidents personal approval.  Tip tillnow both the United States War and Navy Departments have just demanded shipsout of the pool and refused to be gainsaid. The President refers to this indirectlywhen he says that he will.retain the final decision in important cases in his own hands, &quot; because I am fully cognizant of the fact that your Government may feelthat decisions might be made to divert tonnage in contravention of the policywhich I am laying down, in this letter.&quot;In spite of the above, I would not like my colleagues to think that the task of Sir Arthur Salter and Mr. Lew Douglas will be an easy one. The monthlyadjustments of tonnage necessary to fulfil the programmes will always be amatter of difficulty. Both men are first-rate at their job, and Mr. Douglas is, inmy opinion, the high official in the Administration who most completely embracesthe broad and sound principle of carrying on the war as an alliance and as a combined struggle. I must also sound one other note of warning : Whatever is-done, shipping is going to be acutely short in December, January and February,and very short for two or three months after that.Escort Vessels.5. With some difficulty I succeeded in getting the increased programme of:336 escort vessels included in the Presidents letter.   Owing to the change* Appendix A.
in programme we were unable to obtain a final allocation before leaving America.-But, in discussion with Sir Walter Layton, Admiral King definitely agreed tothe principle of a pro rata distribution, and a signal since received reports thatthe ratio of 1 to 1 - 37 is to be applied at all events until September next.   i hope that in due course further orders for corvettes will be placed.A ir craft.6: The President then turns to aircraft. This proved to be the mostintractable of our problems. The programme in the United States has been fixed,at 82,000 combat aircraft. General Arnold and the Services make their plans on the basis that only 80 per cent, of this programme will be fulfilled. I neednot weary my colleagues with a detailed account of the negotiation; but in the.end one or two principles have emerged which I feel to be of the greatest importance : (a) The President has put into a secondary position the policy that american aircraft must be flown by American crews and in its placewholeheartedly embraces the principle of &quot; impact.&quot; This changehas become politically possible as a result of the more active participa-tion of American forces in the various theatres of war. ThePresident, therefore, agreed that the three main American theatres of war the South-West Pacific, Great Britain and North Africa-should be built up simultaneously with,the R.A.F. and Russia and-inprinciple only after the full requirements and wastage for thoseAmerican theatres and for the Allies had been built up pari passushould additions to the Air Force in the United States be considered.(&amp;) Under the present scheme the R.A.F. will share pari passu with theAmerican air forces and month by month in the production of the types that concern us. The Americans disputed our reading of theArnold-Towers-Portal Agreement, under which we expected toreceive 7,347 combat aircraft; furthermore, we were asking for additional quantities and better types. As a result of the recent negotiations, we shall receive 9,212 aircraft, including 600 transports,provided 80 per cent, of the production programme is attained.Against this we have an obligation to supply 600 Spitfires to maintainU.S.A.A.F. groups armed with this type. The agreed schedule of deliveries is set out in Appendix &quot; B.&quot; The promise of 398 Liberatorsshould be helpful, and there is a general improvement in the qualifyof types. Our Russian commitments are not covered in full, but it is reasonable to hope for further deliveries against the balance when thesituation is reviewed next year... This is most desirable in view of theinsufficiency of aircraft for the types.I feel that, with the new production set up and the great drive*and political pressure behind the aircraft programme,, it is reasonable to assume 80 per cent, fulfilment.(c) It is agreed that we. should participate at least pari passu in anyproduction in excels of 80 per cent., but I expect to get much morethan this when the course of production is again reviewed in Aprilor May. General Arnold said to me, before several witnesses, thathe was prepared to be most liberal in allocations over 80 per cent.(d) The help given to the F.A.A. is inadequate:   Our own mission were,however, obliged to confess that, when the 300 extra dive-bombers nowallotted are included, the percentage of supplies during 1943 inrelation to requirements (calculating reserves on the same basis for both countries) would be slightly higher for our Navy than for theUnited States Navy. It will be necessary to examine closely whatadjustments in our own programme are necessary to meet the unfilledrequirements of the F.A.A. An increased scale of deliveries from:United States towards the end of 1943 is not unlikely.(e) Negotiations regarding Mustang production are proceeding satisfac-satisfactorily, but will take some weeks to complete, and I could not wait forthis alone.I expect shortly to. receive confirmation that the componentsnecessary for assembly of 500 Mustang airframes will be madeavailable to this country as a prelude to a more ambitious scheme.[247251 &quot; b-2
It has already been agreed (i) to increase the production of liquid cooled engines byexpanding the . present Packard-Merlin line to produce2,000 per month in 1944;(ii) to make every endeavour to establish a new production linefor the Merlin 68, from which deliveries would rise to 1,200a month during 1944.Army Supplies.7. Agreement was reached on a large number of major items of our army requirements (see Appendix &quot; C &quot;); but we have made reservations on the size ofthe American tank programme. Medium Tank production has been reduced to36,000, but this figure includes 11,000 units of self-propelled artillery. The WarOffice section of the Mission thought that this cut is too drastic and it will be noticed that the President agrees. . I think the President will direct that the medium tank target should be raised by about 4,000 in 1943. This would enable us to get our revised requirements in full.General.8. The President includes in his letter an undertaking covering the supply to us of raw materials, machine tools, components and complementary items.Finally, in his last paragraph he assures us that we may regard all the under-takings as a firm basis on which to plan our production and allocate ourman-power.. 9. The negotiations were subject to some adverse conditions and to twofavourable ones.   The adverse conditions were : First, the outcome of the election which I judge made the Presidentless willing at this moment to override the Services.Second, the bitter controversy and struggle, which raged all throughthe time of my visit, between the W.P.B. and the Services. This centred onthe question whether W.P.B. or the Services should control the production of aircraft and generally on the subject of &quot; scheduling&quot; in which the wholeof &quot; planning &quot; is involved. The outcome, which confirms the powers ofthe W.P.B., was satisfactory; but agreement was only reached on the day left:Thirdly, the fight put up by the Navy Department against the aircraft and merchant shipbuilding programme.Fourthly, the rapidly moving events of &quot;Torch&quot; which enabled delayingtactics to be employed by those who did not want to part with American-produced supplies.The outstanding favourable factor was, of course, the victory in Egypt, whichhas restored the. prestige of British arms in the United States and has, at leasttemporarily, removed the fear that good equipment was being wasted on anincompetent army. Without this none of the agreements outlined above could, Ithink, have been concluded in their present form. ,The President and Mr. Hopkins,who retains an even greater influence than before, are our greatest stand-by and support for any combined policy.The other favourable factor was the decision taken in October to put a ceilingon the expansion of the Ground and Air Forces of the United States. This setlimits to the the more extravagant demands of the American Service Departments.Our own requirements had also been severely screened. On both sides, therefore,the discussion was on a much more realistic basis than on previous occasions.10. The success achieved is due primarily to the excellent work of the various sections of the mission sent by the Departments from Home, and to the variousresident delegations in Washington.11.

(W.P. (42) 563.)ANNEX.Letter from President Roosevelt to the Prime Minister.. -        - The White House, Washington,My dear Winston, , November 30, 1942.I presume that we shall never satisfy ourselves as to the relative need ofmerchant ships versus escort vessels. In this case I believe we should try to have our cake and eat it too.At any rate, we are moving aggressively here to increase both of theseprograms and have given them the highest priority for materiel and machine tools. ,,So far as merchant shipping is concerned, we have, after re-examination ofour steel plate problem and other facilities, determined to increase it to18,800,000 deadweight tons in 1943. I intend to raise this to 20 million tons if,after re-examination by our people, it should prove possible.Of one thing I think you can be sure : that we will build in this country aminimum of 18,800,000 tons of merchant shipping of all kinds. Your offices here will keep you informed of the types of ships that are being built, and, naturally,I would welcome your judgment in regard to this, because it is very important that we have a proper balance between tankers, cargo vessels and transports.I agree that this is the time for me to reply to you concerning the very urgent rquirements of the British shipping program in 1943.I have had. the 27 million ton figure of imports to the British Islesexamined rather hurriedly here by our own people and they are satisfied that this figure is substantially correct.Our joint war effort requires that this pipe-line.of materiel and food to britain be maintained; that the moving of this tonnage.at reasonably even levelsis a matter of primary importance.   I recognize it as such.I am well aware of the concern with which your Government faces the seriousnet losses in tonnage to your merchant fleet. It is a net loss which persists, andI think we must face the fact that it may well continue through all of next year.I therefore want to give you the assurance tnat from our expanding fleet you maydepend on the tonnage necessary to meet your import program.Accordingly, I am instructing our Shipping Administration to allocatethrough the machinery of the Combined Shipping Adjustment Board enoughdry-cargo tonnage out of the surplus shipbuilding to meet your imports, the supplyand maintenance of your armed forces and other services essential to maintaining the war effort of the British Commonwealth, to the extent that they cannot be transported by the fleet under British control.I have been given to understand by our combined shipping people that anaverage of nearly 300,000 tons each month of carrying capacity will have to beused to supplement the tonnage already engaged on behalf of the British war effort. Because of the commitments already made, the allocation of ships duringthe next three months must of necessity be less than the average for the whole period.We may hope for a substantial reduction in this if we can make our way through the Mediterranean. Furthermore, I think that you and I should insist that every possible economy is exercised by our shipping and military authorities.You will, I am sure, agree that emergencies may develop which may requireme to divert for our own military purposes tonnage which it is now contemplatedwill be utilized for imports to Great Britain. There will, no doubt, be other cases in which we shall wish jointly to confer relative to vital military uses ofmerchant tonnage.I want you to know that any important diversions of tonnage will be imadeonly with my personal approval, because I am fully cognizant of the fact that your Government may feel that decisions might be made to divert tonnage in contravention of the policy which I am laying down in this letter. [SeeEnclosure.] .The allocation of tonnage month by month must be worked out by the combined Shipping Adjustment Board. And hence I confine myself to the above statement of policy. I wish to give you the definite assurance, subject to the qualifications I have indicated, that your requirements will be met.We have increased our escort program recently by 70 for 1943, so that weshould turn out 336 escort vessels during the next calendar year. I am askingAdmiral King to confer with your representatives here and make arrangementsabout the distribution of these ships.
The problem of getting our troops to England is a serious one. I recognizethat there must be a minimum joint force there, well equipped and prepared tomeet any eventuality.While &quot; Roundup &quot; seems more.and more difficult, I do not think it shouldbe taken off the boards by any means. We never can tell when the opportunitymay come for us to strike across the Channel, and&apos;if that opportunity comes wemust be ready to take it. Obviously, however, the success of our joint enterprisein North Africa requires us to review the movement of our troops during the nextfew months. We need to come to an early decision as to what our next steps are going to be, and upon that decision must rest the determination of the. numberof American divisions that should be in England. We have this whole matter very much in mind here, and our Chiefs of Staff have it under constantconsideration.As you know, we have recently agreed upon a program of 82,000 combat-planes. There have been misgivings in some quarters about the size of thisprogram. I have none. We simply must get a complete domination of the airnext year, even though other important things give way.One thing is sure : that the aircraft must be brought to bear on the enemy atthe earliest possible moment, and, if there are competent British and Russiancrews to fight these planes and you can get at the enemy quicker and just as effectively as we can, then I have no hesitancy in saying that you and the Russiansshould have the planes you need.We must give consideration to the shipping difficulties that are met when wesend our United States air forces great distances. We have heavy commitments in the Southwest Pacific. We are rapidly assuming similar commitments in north africa, and the bombing of Germany and Italy, whether from England or Russia,must be an unrelenting and constant business.There have been many conferences taking place here between our respectiverepresentatives regarding the distribution of aircraft. I am in accord with theagreement that has been reached. Oliver will tell you of this. A detailedmemorandum of the agreement will follow in a few days. Oliver has impressed upon me the necessity of making an early decision regarding the distribution ofour combined aircraft production. I think the decisions that we have come toregarding aircraft are of the highest importance.I am told that there is a substantial meeting of minds between your repre-sentatives and ours relative to the medium tank. I must confess that I think weare both underrating the need for these medium tanks. It is quite possible thatthe Russians may again press for large increases in medium tanks and I havea feeling that we are cutting our pattern pretty thin. I am asking general marshall to explore this once more. I should think it would be no great strain on our production to get a few more thousand medium tanks in 1943.I understand that some of your ground force requirements have not yet beendiscussed with my officers. These are being considered. Every effort will bemade to include your essential requirements in our Army Supply programme and I have asked to have a report of these further discussions submitted to measures early as possible.I also recognize that your own production for Navy, Army and Air, and forthe minimum needs of the civilian population, requires an&quot; assured flow ofmaterials, machine tools, components and complementary items from America.These supplies, unless unforeseen circumstances intervene, will be maintained.In conclusion, I want you to feel that this letter, together with the agreementsthat Oliver is taking home with him, gives you the assurances that you need in planning your own production, and that you may regard them as a firm base uponwhich to make the allocations of your remaining reserves of manpower.As ever yours,FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT.P.S. I forgot to say:  Russia asks 500 transport planes as a primenecessity.   Let us remember that we may have to revise that item,     f&apos;. d. r.The Right HonourableWinston Churchill,Prime Minister.
Enclosure.Memorandum for Admiral Land.I have been going over with Oliver Lyttelton the import needs of the UnitedKingdom for 1943, together with the whole shipping problem of the BritishGovernment. In all probability, the British are going to lose again in 1943 moreships than they can build. If we are going to keep England in.the war at anything like this maximum capacity, we must consider the supplementing of their merchantfleet as one of the top military necessities of the war. Naturally, the support ofour forces in the Southwest Pacific and in Africa fall in the same category.I am very anxious that the British programs shall be carried out inaccordance with the principle of the memorandum of the 6th October, which Ihave approved, and that there be no substantial diversions from any of theseenterprises. I.wish you would consult me prior to any action taken by you whichwould seriously affect any one of them.. Of course, I do not expect to be consulted by you on the many adjustments you are required to make from day to day.November 30, 1942.F. D. 11.
(U.S. Secret.) APPENDIX A.(British Most Secret.)Memorandum to the President of the United States from Donald M. Nelson,Chairman, War Production Board; Claude R.-Wickard, Secretary of Agri-culture; W. Averell Harriman, Special Representative of the President.November 19, 1942.CONCERNING the request of the United Kingdom to the United states for additional merchant ship tonnage during 1943, we have reviewed within thetime available the proposed British import requirements and submit the following observations : 1. Estimates made by British authorities show that the minimum consump-tion requirements of the United Kingdom to be met from Imports and existingstocks, after taking account of domestic production, are approximately 29 million tons. This demand breaks down roughly into 10 - 5 million tons for food, approxi-mately 16 million tons for raw and industrial materials and about 2-5 million tons for munitions and miscellaneous products.2. British requirements for imported food of 10-5 million tons for 1943 isconsidered reasonable by the American side of the Combined Food Board. Totalfood imports in the United Kingdom before the war were more than twice the aboveproposed minimum import requirements. This marked reduction has been made possible by (a) a large expansion in the domestic production of carbohydratefoods, notably wheat, potatoes and sugar; (b) a reduction in the consumption ofcertain categories which formerly bulked large in imports, notably fats and meats;and (c) more efficient utilization of shipping tonnage for food resulting from asubstitution of concentrated products for bulky goods, as in the case of dried eggsfor eggs in the shell. While the Combined Food Board is exploring every possi-bility of reducing tonnage required for the importation of food into the UnitedKingdom, it is believed, unlikely that such changes can substantially affect the 1943situation. t.3. A brief review of the 16 million ton requirements for materials indicates that nearly one-half of this total is accounted for by steel and steel-making materials. The balance is largely comprised of non-ferrous metals, timber,chemicals and textiles. The American side of the Combined Raw MaterialsBoard concludes that these estimates appear to be reasonably minimum require-ments when related to proposed war production schedules of the United Kingdom.It is important to note, of course, that if British production schedules are modifiedbecause of limiting factors, such as man-power, the import demands for rawmaterials of the British will be modified accordingly.4. The question arises as to how much of the required 29 million tons of net consumption by the British in 1943 may be drawn down from existing stocksrather than imported. It has been proposed by the British that the import-program for 1943 be set at 27 million tons, thus providing for a further reduction of inventories of approximately 2 million tons. This would be in line with the determination of the War Cabinet made in July 1942, to the effect thatthe British stock position could be reduced by 4 million tons from the level whidhprevailed at the close of 1941, but that any reduction beyond that point wouldbe untenable. This reduction will be fully accomplished by the end of 1943 ifthe import and consumption figures indicated above are accomplished. Further,it should be noted that most of the reduction will take place in raw materials.The opinion of those familiar with the British stock position is to the effect thatthe proposed reduction in British -stocks of raw materials and food is about as large as can be safely accomplished in view of shipping and other uncertainties.5. Our general conclusion, on the basis of the examination we have beenable to make, is that the 27 million-ton import requirement for 1943 is a reasonableestimate of United Kingdom needs. However, conclusions based upon this promiseshould be subjected to a continuing examination on the part of the combined food Board, the Combined Raw Materials Board, the Combined Production and resources Board, and the Combined Shipping Adjustment Board, with the thought that future adjustments may be indicated in the light of experience.A fuller report on the food situation prepared by the American side of the combined Food Board is attached.Respectfully submitted,DONALD M. NELSON.CLAUDE R. WICKARD.W. AVERELL HARRIMAN.
(Confidential Memorandum by the American side of the Combined Food Board.)United Kingdom Food Import Program for 1943.1. Of the total import program tonnage into the United Kingdom in 1943of 27 million tons, it is proposed that 10,800,000 tons be used for food.. Of thelatter quantity, about 300,000 tons is to be moved in non-ocean-going tonnage,chiefly from Eire.2. An import program for food of this order is considered reasonable. Itcompares with total food imports into the United Kingdom before the war ofapproximately 23 million tons, or more than twice the proposed figure of10,800,000 tons for 1943. This marked reduction in imports has been made possible by (a) a large expansion in the domestic production of green vegetablesand carbohydrate foods, notably wheat, potatoes and sugar; (&amp;) an importantreduction in consumption of certain categories, notably fats and meat, which stillbulk large in imports; and (c) more efficient utilisation of shipping tonnage for food resulting from a substitution of concentrated products for bulky goods. a notable example of the latter is found in the substitution of dried eggs for eggsin the shell.3. The Combined Food Board, working with and through the food authori-ties of the United Kingdom and the United States, is exploring every possibilityof reducing the tonnage required for the importation of, food into the UnitedKingdom. One possibility lies in further changes in British agricultural production, but it is unlikely that such changes could substantially affect the foodimport tonnage during 1943. Still further progress can undoubtedly be made inthe direction of shipping more concentrated food. The Combined Food Boardalso has under constant review the possibility, of. diversion of ships from more distant to closer sources of su pply, and will from time to time make recommenda-tions to shipping authorities in this regard. One such move has already, been recommended in respect to reducing the United Kingdom imports of meat from australia and. New Zealand and increasing imports from the United States. Itmust be recognised, however, that there are distinct limitations on further reductions in the use of ships for food through diversion or the shipment of moreconcentrated foods since by far the greater part of total United kingdom import still consists of three categories of bulky goods, notably wheat, sugar, andoilseeds and meat. Of these, wheat and sugar will be taken in 1943 from the nearest available sources of supply, namely, Canada in respect of wheat and the carribbean in respect of sugar.4. It is understood that the 1943 food import program takes into account the possibility of some reduction in the stocks of food in the United Kingdom atthe end of 1943, compared with stocks at the end of 1941. This reduction wouldbe almost entirely in such bulk import items as bread grains and sugar. It is notbelieved desirable to make any reduction in the stocks of concentrated food items.On the contrary, having in mind the possibility of great need for such food inreoccupied European countries, it would be desirable, when shipping is available,to make some increase in such stocks by the end of 1943.APPENDIX B.Air.. This Appendix sets out the main features which will shortly be incorporated in an agreeement which is now being finalised between Lieut.-GeneralH. II. Arnold and Rear-Admiral IF. McCain, of the United States forces, andAir Marshal D. C. S. Evill and Bear-Admiral W. R. Patterson of the british forces.2.

4. Reference (A) in above schedule, should target production be attained,39 additional P.B. 2Y 3 and 23 additional P.B. Y (Can) will &quot;be allocated in1943.   Otherwise these aircraft will be scheduled for later delivery.5. Reference (B) in above schedule, 600 of these Airocobras will be in exhange for 600 Spitfires which the R.A.F. undertake to supply to maintainUnited States A.A.F. groups.6. Reference (C) in above schedule, 300 additional carrier bombers (typenot yet specified) are to be provided subject to United States Navy being able tomake use of 100 Vengeance and 200 Bermuda surrendered by the R.A.F.7. The broad effect of all the above is that, in addition to meeting most ofthe R.A.F. attrition requirements and some 1,900 aircraft already promised to theF.A.A., we shall receive aircraft during 1943 as follows : (a) 600 transport aircraft of acceptable types;(b) 300 carrier-borne bombers for F.A.A. in last half of 1943 against the surrender by the R.A.F. of 300 dive-bombers;(c) 1,800 fighters in 1943 towards our Russian commitment, against whichR.A.F. undertake to supply 600 Spitfires to maintain U.S.A.A.F.groups;(d) 287 Liberators as a firm commitment (in addition to 111 counted againstthe attrition requirement), with an assurance of greater numberstowards the end of 1943.8. The scheduled allocations to all participants, including United states army and Navy, represent approximately 80 per cent, of the target programmeof 82,000 and will be made a first charge on production. Assignments will bemade on the block system, so that all will share proportionately in accelerationor deceleration of production. The allocation of any surplus production overand above 80 per cent, of 82,000 will be the subject of later discussions on theunderstanding that allocations already agreed fall far short of British require-ments and that special efforts will be made to meet F.A.A. shortages.9. The agreement will make reference to the fact that the requirements ofCanada, Australia and New Zealand are being studied by the United States JointChiefs of Staff along with Dominion representatives in conformity with the policyestablished in CCS. 61/1, and that appropriate allocation of United States typeswill be made.10. An endeavour is being made to obtain agreement that the aircraftdestined for U.S.S.R. in paragraph 7 (c) should be shown as allocation to theBritish so as to avoid any modification of our protocol commitments.11. The agreement will include a suitable paragraph covering the supplyof spares and components. -12. Progress has been made on the following points of special british interests, although it is unlikely that they will be specifically mentioned in theagreement:  (a) Every effort is being made to make United States heavy bombers suitablefor night bombing. A comparatively simple modification has been evolved which gives reasonable hope of success. Modification sets arenow being tried out both in this country and in America.(b) Negotiations for the supply to United Kingdom of components for 500Mustang airframes for assembly and engining in this country are proceeding well. It is hoped that these will form a prelude to amore ambitious scheme.(c) Merlin production from the existing Packard factory will be increasedto 1,400 a month by June 1943, 1,750 a month by December 1943 and2,000 a month thereafter.(d) Active consideration is being given to the establishment of a new production line for the Merlin 68 from which delivery should riseto 1,200 a month during 1944.(e) Merlin production will be switched from the Merlin 28 to the Merlin 68as quickly as possible.December 7, 1942.[24725]
(Most Secret.)Ground Equipment.THIS Appendix has been agreed between Lieutenant-General B. B. Somervell(Commanding General S.O.S.) on behalf of United States War Department and lieutenant-General P. M. Weeks (Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff)and Sir William. Bootes (Chairman of British Supply Council in London) onbehalf of the Lyttelton Mission.Section I.(1) The overall requirements of the forces controlled by the British are nowbeing reviewed in detail, based on the specific requirements of the various theatres of war and in the light of battle experience. This review has been completedfor only certain of the major items of military equipment, but these representsome 60 per cent, of the total money value.(2) It is agreed that the following principles will be applied in the procure-ment of British requirements in United States and in their subsequentassignment: (a) that the British requirements on the United States shall be the minimum necessary to cover the deficit which cannot be supplied from produc-tion under British control, and it is understood that these requirements as now stated do not exceed the British capacity to manor operate as far as their own troops and allies for whom they areresponsible are concerned.(b) that the acceptance of British requirements in the 1943 AmericanProgrammes of Supply and Procurement shall carry an equal obliga-tion to produce and make available to both forces the quantitiesinvolved in accordance with an agreed schedule for the twelve calendar&quot;months of 1943, and in the event of failure to meet the schedules,,the quantities will be scaled down in proportion to the requirementsaccepted.(c) that no departure will be made from this understanding, unless in theevent of a major unforeseen change in the strategical situation, andthen by agreement between the two parties.(3) It is agreed that every effort is to be made to accept into the UnitedStates programme the further British requirements not yet reviewed in detail.These further requirements will also be qualified by (2) above.(4) The limited United Kingdom Production programme assumes andrequires a certain flow of components and complementary items from the UnitedStates (scheduled in Section VI of the A.S.P.). It is agreed that supply of these items shall be maintained.Section II.The following paragraphs set out the important items on which agreement has been reached with the United States War Departments and certain other items no less important on which decisions are requested : (1) Combat Vehicles, Guns and Ammunition.British representatives have tabled specific requirements for 1943 forcombat vehicles and certain guns and ammunition which.cover a substantial part of their previous total programmes of requirements in 1943 for groundArmy equipment. The reductions put forward in this programme (or sinceagreed) are of the order of 25 per cent.  A list of agreed items is attached.(2) Medium Tanks, including S.P. - &apos;On the ground of the probable scarcity of certain critical materials, theUnited States War Department maintain that the general medium tanktarget (including S.P.) to cover the requirements (excluding spares) ofUnited States, United Kingdom, Russia and other Lease-Lend countries should not be set higher than 35,500. The British maintain it is. necessaryto set the medium tank target (including S.P.) at a higher figure, and theUnited States have agreed that, if by the 1st April the situation in raw
materials and facilities will permit, every effort will be made to step up thetotal production for 1943 to 40,000 (including S.P.) with the complementaryspare parts. Until the 1st April, 1943, the scheduled production of mediumtanks for the United States and British will be assigned in the ratio of9 United States to 10 British (subject to paragraph 2 (c), Section I) and,if the total target of 40,000 is found to be possible, schedules will be amended so as to give the British a total of 12,000 medium tanks in 1943 plus an allocation in accordance with strategic needs from any available surplus thatmay mature.(3) Light Tanks.It is agreed that the British requirement of light tanks for 1943 is1,750 out of a total target programme of 13,200.(4) Tank Components.It has been. agreed that the programme for tank components willcontinue on the scale required for the United Kingdom production programme as now planned. These quantities will be the subject of detailedsubmission, but the proposals to be put forward by the British amount to an overall cut&apos; of over 25 per cent.   This item falls under paragraph 4, Section I.(5) 20-mm. Guns and Ammunition.Agreement has not yet been reached on the British Army requirement of20-mm. guns and the necessary ammunition. We ask for approval for ourproposition that Hispano gun output should not be slowed down, and that thesupply of ammunition should be planned to meet as far as may be possible the deficit of United Kingdom production, having regard to the combined production of weapons.  (Also see paragraph 12.)(6) Small Arms Ammunition.The production of small arms ammunition is now under review; it is requested that full consideration shall be given to the British claim for additional capacity for 9 mm. ammunition for Sten Guns.(7) Locomotives.The United Nations requirements (civil and military) are reported to be,000 to end of 1943. The production in sight to end of 1943 is 4,700. Wehave already arranged in United Kingdom for the maximum turn-over tolocomotive manufacture and we request that increased production oflocomotives in United States should be a matter for immediate decision.(8) Vehicles. .For vehicles, the principle has been agreed that the current production forthe British should be controlled by immediate shipping possibilities, and thata cushion will be held available in order to meet an emergency or to takeadvantage of any unforeseen increases in shipping facilities and the Britishask that special consideration should be given to their needs for more tanktranporters and heavy trucks.(9) Items not yet considered.It is agreed that United Kingdom will provide final figures (on thebasis of Section I) for the items not yet considered, at an early date. Inthe meantime, United States War Department have agreed, except as other-wise provided by mutual consent, to include in their tentative programme for the remaining items the unfulfilled balance of existing United Statesprovision on United Kingdom account for 1942 and 1943 together.(10) Engineer Stores.It is agreed that,(a) The present procedure of covering joint requirements of commonitems by means of the combined stock pile shall continue,(b) Non-common items shall be included in the A.S.P. (as provided in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Section I) and requisitions forprocurement will be accepted within the limits of the requirement.
(11) Possible Additional Requirements.Although we have looked ahead as far as we can, the changing courseof war makes it impossible to avoid altogether the presentation of some additional requirements after the general programme has been agreed. Inthe case of spot items, agreement has already been reached on the provisionof a special pool of scarce materials to cover such spot items-this is to be reviewed quarterly.(12) Special Note in Oerlikon 20-mm. Guns.The question of Oerlikon guns and ammunition is outside the sphere ofUnited States War Department but we ask for approval that United StatesOerlikon gun capacity should be employed to the full and that the supplyof Oerlikon ammunition should be planned to meet the deficit of UnitedKingdom production having regard to the combined production of weapons.
