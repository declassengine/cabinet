I WAS asked to focus, for consideration by the War Cabinet, the issues arising from the Man-Power Survey (W.P. (42) 534).In consultation with the Minister of Labour and other Ministers primarily concerned, I have carried my review to a stage at which I can submit to the WarCabinet the broad issue of policy which must be determined before we can allocateour man-power resources during 1943.2. The requirements of the Services from the 1st July, 1942, up to the endof 1943 are-1,301,000 men.303,000 women.These are based on existing programmes and plans. The requirements of each service are summarised in Appendix I.The Navy figure is related, in the main, to the new construction expected tocomplete up to the end of March 1944; but it also includes other importantcommitments, such as naval personnel required for combined operations and forthe defensive equipment of merchant ships, and personnel for the Royal Marines.The Army requirement represents the numbers needed to bring the Army upto the strength indicated in the Prime Ministers latest Directive (W.P. (42) 504),to prepare 14 Divisions for overseas operations in 1943, and to provide for normal wastage at 13.000 a month and battle casualties at 11,000 a month.The Air Force figure is based on the assumption of 502 operational squadronsby the end of 1943 and 635 by the end of 1944. This assumes a specified degreeof fulfilment of the present programme of aircraft production in this country, andno reliance on the receipt of aircraft from the United States except (a) thosedue under the Arnold-Towers-Portal Agreement, and (b) a number of transport aircraft for which the Minister of Production is now negotiating in Washington.3. The stated requirements up to the end of 1943 of the munitions industries and of other essential industries in which further expansion is required are as.follows : 250,000 men.835,000 women.The detailed requirements are summarised in Appendix II.These programmes are related to the needs of Forces built up to the strengths-indicated in the preceding paragraph. They take into account, on the one hand,the present - arrangements for American supplies for our Forces, and, on theother, our obligations to provide munitions for Allied Forces.The Supply Ministers believe that- these additional numbers will actually berequired by the end of 1943. The Minister of Labour, on the other hand, contendsthat there is room for some reduction in this estimate. It is open toargument whether so high a rate of expansion in the labour force is practicable;[24626 I n
and it may be permissible to look for a greater increase in efficiency than has been assumed. It seems to me most important, however, that at this stage the major issue should not be clouded by suggestions that the requirements are inflated orthe supply understated. The decisions which the War Cabinet have to take atthis stage cannot be radically affected by differences of 100,000 or so on either side of the balance. For present purposes, therefore, I suggest that we shouldtake the aggregate figure for the munitions industries as 150,000 less than thesum total of the estimates put forward by the Supply Departments. We should thus set down the requirements for industry as 250,000 men,685,000 women.This does not imply a firm decision that the programmes could be fulfilled withthis additional number of workers. It is put forward, as a reasonably conserva-tive figure of the actual demand likely to arise, for the purpose of presenting the broad issues with which we are at present concerned.4. On this basis the total man-power requirements up to the end of 1943,for both the Forces and munitions, are 1,551,000 men,988,000 women.The global total is thus 2 - 539 millions.5. To meet these demands, the maximum numbers likely to be availableup to the end of 1943 are 950.000 men.650,000 women.This means a global supply of 1 - 6 millions as against a demand of 2-5 millions.The sources from which this supply could be drawn are summarised inAppendix III.6. .Tn view of the magnitude of the demand, the Minister of Labour andI have given anxious thought to the possibility of stretching the supply; but weare satisfied that it would not be prudent to assume that more than another1-6 millions can be drawn into the Forces and munitions before the end of nextyear.Of this total, only a proportion would be available to meet Service require-ments; for men for the Armed Forces must be fit men of military age, and thenumbers of these now left in the civilian population and available for service isnot great. As shown in Appendix III, the total supply of 1-6 millions includes700,000 men for the Armed Forces. To get this number it will be necessary tocall up every fit man of military age in the building and civil engineering industries; and to comb-out 115,000 men from the munitions industries, at least150,000 from the other essential industries, and 300,000 from the &quot; less essential &quot;industries (representing close on three quarters of their fit men, many of who mare in key positions).To achieve the total supply of 1 - 6 million, great efforts will be needed. Theestimate assumes that the labour force of the &apos;&apos; less essential&apos;&apos; industries and services will be reduced by 500,000. There is still some scope for concentration of manufacture&quot; in these industries and for simplification or reorganisation ofthe services; but only a small proportion of the numbers required can be obtained by these means. Moreover, some of the &quot;less essential&quot; industries are partlyengaged on Government orders (e.g., textiles and clothing); and, unless these orders can be reduced, the whole of the cut will fall on that limited part of theindustries which is supplying civil needs. This represents the maximumcontribution that can be exacted from these industries without major changes ofpolicy, such as still further reduction of the clothing ration, part-time closing of food shops and further reduction in supplies of newspapers and books. these changes would involve a substantial reduction in civil standards; and they wouldnot in any event provide much more than an additional 100,000 people.The estimate also assumes that it will be possible to draw into employment,from the group of &quot;unoccupied women,&quot; the equivalent of 500,000 whole-timeworkers. In view of the extent to which women without domestic obligations havealready been recruited for war work, these additional numbers must be foundvery largely from among married women who can only give part-time service.And, to the extent that &quot; unoccupied women &quot; can be recruited only for part-time work, the total numbers to be obtained must be doubled.
Moreover, these numbers can only be drawn into employment, and the net increase in the munitions industries achieved, by securing within the munitions industries a substantial transference of mobile women from areas whereimmobile women are available to areas where the supply of immobile women hasbeen exhausted.I believe that, in spite of the formidable difficulties to be overcome, planscan be made on the assumption of a total supply of 1 - 6 millions. I am equallysatisfied that it would be rash to base our man-power policy on the expectation that larger numbers will be available either for the Forces or for munitions.7. The gap between the aggregate demand and the available supply is thus939,000 men and women. A gap of this magnitude cannot be closed by the familiar process of trimming the demands and stretching the supply. A fewthousands could no doubt be secured by such expedients, but detailed adjustments of this kind will not suffice to balance the account.Moreover, the major deficiency falls upon the Armed Forces the gap between the requirements of men and the numbers of fit men of military age who can be made available is 550,000, while the deficiency in the supply of womenfor the Forces is over 80,000. Thus the gap for the Armed Forces constitutesabout two-thirds of the total deficiency between supply and requirements.8. We must accordingly face the fact that our man-power resources do notmatch our present programmes. We cannot, at the same time, meet the essential needs of the Navy, build up an Army of 100 Divisions and expand the Air force to a total of over 600 operational squadrons.Service strengths have been planned in the past on the assumption that asubstantial proportion of the supplies required to equip them would be forth-coming from the United States. Man-power policy has been framed on the basis that, from 1943 onwards, our munitions industries would have passed their peakproduction and would be able to contribute increasing numbers of men to theServices to use the great mass of equipment built up by these industries andsupplemented from American sources. Since America&apos;s entry into the war wehave now to face the necessity of supplying from our own resources a vastproportion of the equipment which we had expected to be able to draw fromthe United States; and we are thus compelled to retain in our munitions industries the man-power on which we had counted for the continued expansion of our armed Forces.9. It follows that substantial cuts must be made in the present programmes of the Forces. Strategical considerations must determine where the reductions should be made.I therefore suggest that the War Cabinet should first determine roughlyhow the programmed strength of the Services should be reduced. It is not, ofcourse, the case that Service establishments must be reduced to the full extentof the deficiency of 939,000. If the programmed strength of the Services is reduced, a corresponding relief is gained in the. munitions industries by whichthey are supplied.Moreover, the final adjustments cannot be made until we know the resultsof the negotiations which the Minister of Production is now conducting in washington. And there are further possibilities of tempering the cut in Serviceestablishments by finer adjustments between the production programmes and theminimum equipment needs of the Services in the different theatres of war.These questions cannot, however, be investigated in detail until the WarCabinet have fixed the proportions in which the net deficiency in man-power should be shared between the three branches of the Armed Forces.J.

Basis of Calculation of Requirements.(i) Royal Navy Men.The requirements of the Royal Navy are based on the output of new vesselscompleting in the appropriate periods, together with the requirements forcombined operations reckoned on the landing craft which we are likely to obtain.No allowance is made for manning the additional corvettes, the building of whichin the United Kingdom is under consideration, as this requirement is likely to be offset by failure to obtain the Captain&apos;s class corvettes which have hitherto been expected from the United States. No provision is made in the figures forunforeseen commitments, or for new shore bases or establishments.

(iii) Army Men.The basis for the Army requirements is given in the Directive by the Ministerof Defence dated the 1st November, 1942 (W.P. (42) 504). This sets out theBritish. Dominion, Indian and Colonial forces in terms of Divisions or their equivalent, as follows : TABLE IV.United Kingdom ...       ...       ...       ... ...       ... 33Under orders for overseas operations ... ...      ... 5Anti-Aircraft Divisions          ...       ... ...       ... 12Army of the Nile.........       ...       ...... 12Army of Persia and Iraq        ...       ... ...       ... 9Army of India   ...       ...       ...       ... ...       ... 20Garrisons in Africa and elsewhere    ... ...       ... grand Total   ............... 100No formations additional to the above are contemplated. What remains tobe done, however, is (a) To complete the Order of Battle of those formations which are not allcomplete.(b) To provide the Army, Corps, and certain Divisional troops (which arenow lacking) so as to make 14 of the 33 Divisions in the UnitedKingdom fit for overseas operations.To do this, the following addition to the strength of the Army over and aboveits estimated strength on the 31st October 1942, are required : TABLE V.To complete forces in the United Kingdom to the newprganisation (including 3 divisions only on overseas&apos; scales) .....................        80,000To build up Persia and Iraq Command       ...      ...       ...        96,000To complete Indian expansion ...      ...       ...      ...       ...        26,000Total   ...............      ......      202,000Deduct Numbers Middle East will be reduced on transfer of troops to Persia and iraq and reduction of 2 BritishDivisionsTransfer of 1 Brigade to India fromMadagascar53,000       53,000Intake&apos;required for build-up      ...       ...      ...       ...      149,000Add-For completion of 4 more divisions in United kingdom to overseas scales at 12,000 per division    ...       ...        48,000For completion  of  7  further  divisions  in  UnitedKingdom to overseas scales at 11.400 per division ...        80,000Total  for  build-up,  including  14  divisions  in  UnitedKingdom at overseas scales       ...      ...      ...      ...      277,000The remainder of the Army requirements are to meet wastage and battlecasualties.   These amount to the following : Normal monthly wastage : home 9,000, abroad 4,000 13,000Monthly battle casualties abroad     ...      ...      ...      11,000Total.........&apos;.      ...      ...      ...      24,000The above calculations are for the number of divisions now abroad and thoseshortly expected to go abroad. Nothing is included for casualties in majorContinental operations in 1943.49,0004,000
The make-up of the total requirements (including tradesmen) is thus asfollows : TABLE VI.(a) Normal wastage at 13,000 men per month ...(b) Battle wastage at 11,000 men per month for forcesabroad(c) For building-up order of battle, including 14 furtherdivisions to be prepared for overseas service during 1943 ...       ...      ...       ...Total for periodDeduct A.T.S. replacing men ...      ...      ...      ...Add-Net demand November 1942-December 1943I-Actual intake July 1942-October 1942Total...............182,000154,000277,000613,00076,000537,000112,000649,000(iv) Army Women.The total strength the Army requires for the A.T.S. is 265,000.The intake during the period July-October 1942 was 34,000, giving an estimated strength on the 1st October of 170,000. 95,000 are therefore requiredto complete to establishment. These 95,000 will replace 76,000 men, who would otherwise have to be added to the Army requirements of men.Wastage amounts to 2,200 per month, allowing 1 per cent, per month on anaverage strength of 220,000.   The total requirement is therefore : ,TABLE VII.Intake July-October 1942     ......Wastage November 1942-December 1943To complete to establishment...Total     .........34,00031,00095,000160,000(y) R.A.F.-Men.The basis for the R.A.F. requirements of men is the expansion programme,which is shown in Tables X and XI below. In addition to the squadrons and operational training units shown in the tables, there are a large number ofancillary units, which have to be provided.The expansion programme has been drawn up on the followinghypotheses : (a) That the latest forecast of production received in September fromthe Ministry of Aircraft Production will not be completely fulfilled.It is assumed that the present percentage fulfilment, which variesaccording to type (e.g., in the case of heavy bombers the percentageis at present 85), will continue until the middle of 1943, after whichthe percentage will rise until, by the end of 1943, the output will be100 per cent, of the programme.(b) That receipts of American aircraft will be in accordance with theArnold-Towers-Portal Agreement, i.e., that we shall receive in 1943aircraft to make good wastage in those squadrons of the Royal AirForce which will be equipped with American aircraft oh the1st April, 1943.(c) That we shall receive enough American transport aircraft to enable49 more squadrons of this type to be formed.   This matter is under negotiation by the Minister of Production in Washington.   About22,000 men have been included for this requirement.id) That wastage must be calculated on the basis of full operational activity in the various theatres of war.
The total figures are made up as follows :  TABLE VIII.Actual intake 1st July to 31st October, .1942 94,750Approved   intake   during   November   and december 1942    ...       ...      ......      25,250Required in 1943 (a) To make good establishment defi-ciency on 1st January, 1943   ... 64,000(b) For expansion        ...      ...... 98,000(c) For wastage............ 83,000120,000245,000Total     ..................      365,000Wastage.The wastage allowed in the demand for 1943 is divided as under betweenground personnel and crews : Jan. to June.       July to Dec.(a) Ground Personnel        ......      14,650 15,125(6) Crews      ............      26,350 . 26,87541,000 42,000(a) is assessed in relation to the strength in ground personnel as a constantbased on experience and reviewed regularly. It represents the calculated wastagepartly in 1943 and partly in 1944 for which untrained replacements must be entered in 1943, the wastage in the early part of 1943 being normally coveredby earlier entries.(b) is assessed in relation to the expansion and effort following the completionof training of the 1943 intake. It has no relation to the anticipated wastageof crews in 1943 for which untrained entrants must have been entered in 1942and earlier. It represents therefore, the anticipated wastage after 1943 forwhich untrained entrants must be entered in 1943.Requirement to enable squadrons to be transferred to new theatres of warabroad, and to meet unforseen contingencies.Included in the above figures is a requirement amounting to 20,000 men forthe primary purpose of meeting overseas commitments which are certain to arise,but which cannot at present be specified. If a new theatre of war is opened up,or an existing theatre is reinforced, squadrons must be increased from home to overseas establishments. Moreover, these squadrons cannot operate without additional formations to provide the base, lines of communication and head-quarter units; at home the functions of many of these units are undertaken bythe Ministry of Aircraft Production and the aircraft industry.Similarly, the frequent introduction of new types of technical equipment,and the extension of the scope of existing types, necessitate the provision ofadditional men for their operation and maintenance.The personnel required for these contingencies have usually to be found long before new men can be enlisted and trained. Without the margin now proposed,therefore, the absence of which has already led to serious deficiencies in RoyalAir Force strengths, the full demands of stategical flexibility and technical development cannot be met.Royal A ir Force Regiment.The bulk of the demand for personnel for the Royal Air Force Regiment onthe basis of an establishment of 65,000 at home, and 10,000 overseas, has alreadybeen met. A small residual provision, amounting to about 8,000, has been included in the figures.A ge and medical category.A large proportion of the intake now required could be men over 41, or of lowmedical categories.
(vi) R.A.F.-Women.The demands for women are as follows :  TABLE IX.Actual intake 1st July to 31st October,1942............      ... 28,100Approved   intake   for  November   and december 1942       ......... 26,300Required in 1943 : (a) To   make   good   establishmentdeficiency on  1st  January,1943 ......... 7,7.00(6) For expansion......... 27,300(c) For wastage     ...      ....      ... 17,50054,40052,500Total      ......      107,000Margin for additional commitments.An allowance for contingent requirements of 6,000 women in 1943(equivalent of 3-7 per cent, on the number of airwomen at home) has been included. This is comparable to the provision made in the case of men to meetthe transfer of squadrons to new theatres.TABLE X.Royal Air Force.Squadrons Formed or Forming.	1942.		1943.				1944.				Sept.	Dec.

An allowance for these squadrons has been included in the manpower requirements.

A detailed statement of the requirements of the munitions industries is givenin Table XIII.The other industries and services whose labour force must be expandedduring the period are, in the main, industries providing raw materials for munitions, and services essential to the prosecution of the war. Details of thenumbers required by each of these industries and services are given in theMan-Power Survey.2. The man-power requirements put forward by the three Supply Depart-ments are related to the production programmes now contemplated, as follows : The Ministry of Supply figure is based on production programmesrelated, broadly, to an Army strength of the order envisaged by the PrimeMinister in his latest Directive (W.P. (42) 504). It assumes, however, thatthe production planned for the end of 1943 will not, in fact, be fully achieveduntil the spring of 1944.The Admiralty requirements are related to the expansion of naval construction forecast in the First Lord&apos;s Memorandum D.C. (S) (42) 88.The M.A.P. figure represents the expansion necessary to enable them toreach the peak production of their authorised programme. Although the peak output will not now be reached until later than the date originally contemplated, it will still be necessary to bring the labour force to its peakbefore the end of 1943.3. . It is not certain that the full numbers required for all three programmescould be effectively absorbed into employment during the period.The Ministry of Production believe that, if the United States Governmentprovide the shipping assistance for which they have been asked, supplies of rawmaterials should, in general, be adequate for the production envisaged by these programmes. They also believe that difficulties over machine tools, will notnecessarily impose any general limitation.There are, however, other factors to which attention should be drawn.The Admiralty programme depends on the expansion and improvement of -shipyard equipment and the transfer of some productive capacity at present working for other Supply Departments.   In so far as this expansion of capacitymay not be achieved, the full numbers of additional workers will not be required.The man-power demands of M.A.P. (in the munitions industries) assumed monthly rate of expansion of 36,000 operatives in the first half of. 1943 and35,000 in the second half of that year. In recent months the expansion of thelabour force in the aircraft industry has varied from 19,000 to 25,000. Thedemand therefore assumes that the aircraft industry will be able to expand itslabour force at a rate substantially in excess of anything so far achieved. TheMinister of Aircraft Production believes that this increased rate.of absorptionis possible.TABLE XIII.Proposed Expansion of the Munitions Industries.(Thousands, male and female.)Supply Depart-ment	July 1942			December 1942			July 1943			December 1943			Increase July 1942-December 1943			Opera-tives	Others	Total	Opera-tives	Others	Total	Opera-tives	Others; Total i		Opera-tives	Others	Total	Opera-tives	Others	TotalAdmiralty Supply   ...

SUPPLY OF MAN-POWER FOR THE PERIOD JULY 1, 1942, TODECEMBER 31, 1943.OVER the eighteen months from July 1942 to December 1943 we cannot expect to find more than 1,600,000 men and women (950,000 men and650,000 women) to meet the needs of the Services and the munitions industries.The achievement of a net supply of this magnitude will involve the actualtransfer of much greater numbers. Normal wastage in industry must be replaced;but, in addition to this, if a man is taken from the munitions industries for theForces, his place may be filled by a woman transferred from less essential industry,who, in her turn, may be replaced by a formerly unoccupied woman, or by twosuch women on a part-time basis. The total of 1,600,000 represents the netaddition to the numbers in the Services and munitions resulting from all these processes of transfer.2. It is not enough to consider supply of man-power globally; it must alsobe considered in relation to the particular needs and the means of meeting them;for example, men for the Forces must be found among the remaining fit men ofmilitary age in the civil population.The division of the total supply into the specific supplies which are availableto meet the particular needs is as follows : TABLE XIV.Men for the Forces    ...       ...Women for the Auxiliary Services ...Men for the munitions and other industriesWomen for the munitions and other industriesTotal ......      ...      ...      ...    1,600,000The provision of these supplies involves, not only the vigorous prosecution of existing policy, but also certain new arrangements. Under the first headthere are included a continuing comb-out of munitions and civil industries toprovide men for the Forces, a further transfer of women from less to more essential industry and to the Auxiliary Services (with some consequent reductionin civil standards), further application of schemes of industrial concentration,and the drawing of more unoccupied women into employment. The new arrange-ments comprise the lowering of the age of call-up of men to 18, the lowering of the call-up age of women to 19 and the calling-up of women in the 1912-1917age-group, the call-up of all fit men of military age from building, and a comb-out-of men and women in National and Local Government Service.Full allowance has been made for items such as the return of wastage fromthe Services, immigration from Eire, releases from Civil Defence, and italian prisoners.3. It is necessary to consider the drain on various branches of civil industry which will result from the provision of 1 - 6 millions for the Services and munitions.Apart from the recruitment of unoccupied women (estimated at&quot;&apos; 165,000), andthe various &quot; windfall &quot; items (wastage from the Services, immigrants, italian prisoners, &amp;c), the men and women provided for the Services and munitionsmust be withdrawn from industry. *The gross withdrawal will be about 1,260,000. This depends upon the netreductions which can be borne by civil industry (or. in the oase of the munitions industries, the extent to which men combed out of individual establishments neednot be replaced), and upon the number of unoccupied women who can be recruited:* The figure of men for the Forces does&apos; not take individual account of men on the R.A-F.Deferred List, nor of arrangements for meeting the needs of the Services for tradesmen. Whilethe total figure for supply of men could be increased to some, extent on both these counts, a-corresponding drain on industry is involved.700,000*220,000250,000430,000
Total ...    1,020,000 335,000 685,0004. The provision of 1,600,000 men and women for the Forces and munitionsthus involves : (a) A cut of 225,000 in the number of building workers.lb) A comb-out of men and women from National and Local government service.(c) The non-replacement of 85,000 men combed out from the munitions.industries for the Services.(d) A cut of 100,000 in the number of workers in&quot; the more essential industries (i.e., agriculture, transport and food industries), equivalentto 3-5 per cent, of their labour force in July 1942.(e) A cut of 500,000 (or just over 8 per cent.) in the number of workers inthe less essential industries and services.(J) Recruitment of unoccupied women up to the equivalent of 500,000 full-time, workers.* Apart from this, the munitions industries will, of course, need a considerable net increase in&quot;their labour for-ce (see Apptendix II).In some industries it will not be necessary to replace any of the men andwomen withdrawn; this is the case with building and National and LocalGovernment Service. Some replacement is, however, necessary in the case of thosecombed out of the munitions industries and those withdrawn from more essential and less essential industry. It is estimated that 85,000 men of the 120,000 to becombed out from-the munitions industries need not be replaced,* that 100,000workers can be taken out of more essential industry without replacement, andthat less essential industry can bear a net reduction of 500,000.With regard to the recruitment of unoccupied women, on the basis of past experience &quot;and the present age-distribution and marital condition of unoccupiedwomen, the Ministry of Labour do not consider that it will be possible to recruitmore than the equivalent of 500,000 full-time workers. (As a great increase inpart-time work will be involved, the actual number of women needed will be substantially greater than 500,000.) The arrangements for the supply to theServices and munitions already involve the recruitment of 165,000 women directly from the unoccupied class. This leaves a balance of 335,000 available to replaceworkers withdrawn from the munitions and other industries.On the basis of these net reductions and the numbers of unoccupied women who can be provided as replacements, the distribution of the gross withdrawalamong the different categories of industry is as shown in the following Table :-TABLE XV.Gross withdrawals *for Services and Replacement ReplacementMunitions. necessary. unnecessary.Munitions        ...      ... 120,000 35,000 85,000More essential industry 185,000 85,000 100,000Less essential industry(excluding building)... 715,000 215,000 500,000
