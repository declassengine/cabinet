COPY NO. j30th-November 1942.  .........                       WAR CABINET.CIVIL DEFENCE AND MANPOWER.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Ministerof Home Security.The Prime Minister has asked me in W.P.(42) 556 to considerby the end of next year a cut of 111,000 in the Civil defence services, for England and Wales and Scotland, including theNational Fire Service and the Police, on a whole-time strength at the end of June last of 311,000 men and 80,000 women.(60,000 Regular policemen are included in this total but theyare of. course mainly employed on other than Civil Defence duties.;Unlike the Service Ministers 1 had no notice of theseproposed reductions and I have had no time to consider in detailwhat effect they would be likely to have on the Civil defence services, but I submit the following general observations.This is a very drastic proposal which involves risks whichthe Cabinet should appreciate and accept as a whole beforeirrevocable steps are taken to revise establishments and strengths,and disperse large numbers of highly trained personnel.     Thematter is the more grave because, if I understand the PrimeMinister&apos;s other proposals correctly, any reduction in the civil defence Services would be accompanied by a reduction in the anti-aircraft defences of the country (which in itself gives me some concern) and consequently the risks of successive and repeatedattacks on a single target would be proportionately increased.The Prime Minister&apos;s proposals are based on certain assumptionswhich he ujakes as Minister of Defence but if these assumptionsshould unhappily be falsified in the event it v/ould be too late to repair the damage and the Minister of Home Security would standarraigned of a premature withdrawal of essential services.     Insuch circumstances I should, of course, have to. justify my action,by reference tothedecision taken by the whole Cabinet.The Civil Defence establishments are fixed on carefullycalculated scales of preparation, and the great bulk of theServices is now to be found in areas which are admittedly liableto sporadic and dangerous air raids.     Ih many of the less vulnerable areas the number of whole-time members of the services is now no larger than is necessary to provide a nucleus which canbe made up by part-time personnel, though these are subject towastage from call-up to military service or transfer to industry inother districts.     There is little scope for reduction in such areas.     If the full-time strengths are halved in some areas (asthey would have to be), the possibility must be faced thatextensive fires might have to be left to spread and burn themselvescasualties might be trapped under ruins and left to die oftheir injuries or burn to death.     Improvisation by means ofuntrained military or civilian personnel at the eleventh hourjn+v not be      adequate substitute for a disintegrated service,although the use&apos; of mobile reinforcements might do something tor if?   te the Position*     It could not, however, prevent the loss ofPUPiie morale or -criticism of a Government that had imprudentlyJ-spersed trained Services which, when needed in the past, had shown themselves invaluable.

It is to be noted that the Civil Defence reductions nowproposed differ in kind from those contemplated for the armed forces.     The latter are asked to arrest their growth, while theCJL^il Defence Services and the Police which.,  since the beginning ofthe year, have given up (on my-own initiative) substantial numbersof men and women to the Forces or to industry., are invited to makestill further reductions on a large scale.     Since 51st december last the whole-time strength of the Civil Defence (General) Serviceshas been&apos;reduced from 176,000 to 127,000 and the Police and PoliceWar Reserve from 110,000 to 97,000.     The National Fire Servicevrtiich, in the autumn&apos;of 1941, had been granted a ceiling, of 156,600is now down to 130,500.I am prepared to scrutunise all Civil Defence establishments tosee what further progressive economies&apos; on manpower are possible butanything like an all over cut of 111,000 by the end of 1943 seems tome to be gambling very heavily in futures on the strength of an appreciation of the risks of aerial attack which normally can never be valid for long ahead.      I have to face the fact that a town&apos; orcentre on some day or night or other may receive substantial enemy attack, even though the German Air Force is heavily occupied else-where:    and I can never be sure of the clay or night or the town orcentre.In the case of the National Fire Service in particular&apos; theessential consideration is that, with the present methods ofincendiary attack, the enemy can bring to bear on any point:at anytime a weight of attack which is greatly in excess of anything theappliances and men on the spot can meet.Reinforcing from a distance is slow, and slowest in the&quot;Baedekerareas where towos are far apart.     Moreover, the capacity to reinforce depends in the main on whole-time personnel.Speaking generally,, therefore, the position is that, in spiteof all that has been achieved in the way of greater mobility -and improved training by the nationalisation of the Fire Service, theprotection against major fire situations is already thin.If there is to be any substantial further cut in the whole-time strength of the National Fire Service it must probably come inthe main from London and the industrial Midlands and North..     But a cut of even 10,000 men would make a very serious inroad into thepresent strength, and no further cut could be made without very -definitely uncovering these areas against incendiary attack on anysubstantial scale.In the Civil Defence (General) Services there may be scope forsome further reductions, above all in the London Region, but it&apos;willsometimes be at the cost of essential local authority work which an increasing number of Civil Defence personnel now carry out duringtheiriduty periods.     The temptation of the local authorities, asthe Minister of Labour is aware, is to discard from weakness not fromstrength when any demands for cuts are made of them, and thereforeless -assistance to industry and still less to the Armed Forces may beanticipated as a result of the comb-out than, would at first seemProbable.The Police Services, like the Civil Defence Services, havealready lost most of their men under. 27.     If some reduction ofin iue strenSth must be faced I could not agree that any reductionjn the Civil Defence Services should be applied pro rats, to thepolice.  ^ The more the Civil Defence Services are reduced,, thegreater is the potential demand Tor police services in any emergency.

H.M.[reparations OFFICE.10th November 1942.Moreover, - quite apart from emergency demands on the police -any substantial impairment of police efficiency involvesimpai-ment of the whole scheme of ordered control of thecivilvpopulation on which the war effort depends.I must make a final point.     4f ever the need arises to restore the truncated Civil Defence Services, this can only3e done by recall of released personnel.     For this reasonpa and women who may be released between now and the end ofUxt year should be placed in employment in the area in whichthey have been serving and not be made available for thefcraed Forces or the Auxiliary Services, or transferred to areas in which their Civil Defence experience may not be needed.     Moreover, if some areas are not to be left largely^covered, steps must be taken to retain a certain proportionpf the able-bodied.part-time members of these Services(particularly in the Rescue Service) who would otherwise befailed up for military service or transferred to munition industries elsewhere.
