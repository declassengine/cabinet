No&quot;&quot;984 (GibJ-^Oth Nov.. 1942.&quot;EDITED LITERAL TEXT&quot;To * Co C o S oFrom: C in CBadly garbled message just received from Clark .states that three French officers from Dakar concludeda conference with Darlan at Algiers Thursday.   Darlanhas sent a letter to Boisson by the Dakar representativesrequesting Boisson to come to Algiers to conclude final arrangements.   Dakar representatives were insistentthat future negotiations be handled by Americans in nameof United States,   The conference progressed to the pointof discussion such details as to how the Richielieuinight.be taken to United States for repairs.Darlan is not optimistic over the prospects of getting the^o4ilQnnFl^eet, but he is confident thatDakar will join us and that,Godfroy will probably followas soon as arrangements witti Bo&amp;sson &quot;are concluded.   i feel that if the Dakar and Alexandria Fleets should joinus, the attitude of the Toulon Fleet towards us will improve materially.It appears that the best chance of success requiresconferences to be held at a place where Dakar represen-tatives can confer with Darlan and American representative.This points to Algiers as the logical place, but inasmuch as West Africa is outside the Torch Theater, I am withoutauthority to participate in the effort.   I am, however,,quite willing to assume this responsibility if you directme to do so.   In the meantime,   I am directing Clarkto keep in touch.(Circulation)Hrig.
