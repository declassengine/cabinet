(42) 516), has urged the War Cabinet to give itsapproval to the general conception of a post-war foreign policy based on theco-operative leadership, within the framework of the United Nations, of theBritish Commonwealth, the United States and Russia, with China added to pleaseAmerican sentiment. He pleads for this, in paragraph 8, as a &quot; present basisof our foreign policy, which, in the future, will no doubt be modified.&quot; Thusstated the policy he advocates may well command general assent. The powers concerned are the main Allies upon whose efforts victory depends and whosecontinued co-operation we should aim at securing, so far as that may prove possible, not only in the actual peace settlement, but also in the beginnings of thegeneral world organisation of the future.Where I would, however, differ from him is in the assumption that thisparticular combination is in any special way fitted to serve as the permanent basisof that world organisation or, in particular, to deal with the specific problem ofEuropean peace. It is, after all, so far as Russia and China are Concerned, an ad hoc combination, resulting from German and Japanese aggression rather than from any inherent identity either of outlook or of interest with ourselves or withthe United States. While we may reasonably believe that Anglo-american co-operation will tend, on the whole, though with fluctuations, to remain closerthan before this war, especially in times of acute world crisis, it is not easy tosee any special reasons why that should necessarily apply to the external relations of, either of the other two. Our experience of the sequel to the Anglo-japanese alliance or to the Anglo-Italian Alliance of the last war, both based on long-standing friendship, should teach us caution.In any case, even if the present combination might survive for certain broadworld purposes, I cannot myself believe that it is likely to remain for very manyyears sufficiently effective and united in action to be able to deal with the most difficult and dangerous of problems, namely, that of the permanent structure ofEuropean peace. The gyroscopic tendency of nations to revert to their normal course after the violent deflections of such a crisis as the present war is boundto assert itself. The swing-back in America from the Roosevelt-Cordeli Hullpolicies has already begun and will presently gain momentum. The UnitedStates may not swing back as violently as after 1919, and will probably continueto take a lively interest in. the Western Pacific, where its help may be very[24620] ^
valuable against the danger of a Japanese revival or of Chinese aggressiveimperialism. But it will almost certainly once again wash its hands, as soon asit indecently can, of the tiresome problems of Europe and the Near East. Russia,whose external policy, under Stalin&apos;s elementary realism, is rapidly reverting tothe traditional lines of old Tsarist days, may find her main preoccupation in asia. If her interest in Europe revives it is, I fear, less likely to be concernedwith European peace than with the extension of Russian power. China,obviously, is not really concerned. As for ourselves, we shall be far too busy with india and a host of problems, world-wide and domestic^ to be any more readythan we were after the last war to continue indefinitely to devote the close attention or make the sacrifices required for the effective policing of Europe fromwithout. The structure of European peace, if it is to be enduring, must beself-contained.What is more, it must be confined to Europe. The League of Nations failedbecause, as Field Marshal Smuts has pointed out, it was both too ambitious and,too vague. Too ambitious, in so far as it tried to cover the whole world insteadpf concentrating on the real source of danger in Europe. Too vague, because itassumed that a mere standing conference of all States, whether directly interestedor not, could deal with the accumulated causes of international conflict after they had come to a head, and failed, to realise that only an organic structure,covering the whole field of the mutual relations, political and economic, of its members, and appealing to their imagination and loyalty, can effectively dispose of the issues that otherwise lead up to war. The League did valuable work inmany directions. There are many questions which are essentially world-wide in scope and important, even if not acutely controversial. In respect of these, aswell as of international conciliation, there is still a great and growing field before it. But the maintenance and enforcement of peace is a more essentially limitedtask for which no world-embracing organisation is yet in sight.Is such an organic, constitutional scheme for Europe a possibility? Theproblem is essentially the same as that with which we are faced in India. Asin the case of India, it can only be solved by agreement and compromise among those immediately concerned arising from a conviction that some sort of unity asthe foundation of mutual peaceful co-operation is worth while, and by the emergence of something in the nature of a European patriotism.On the practical side there is an almost overwhelming case, under modern conditions, for some sort of unity in a little sub-continent, no bigger than India,and far smaller than Australia or Canada, almost all of which can be reached,by the peaceful traveller or the hostile bomber, in a few hours, from any part.Jn the world ahead of us the existing political divisions of Europe are, whetherfrom the military or the economic point of view, an absurd anachronism. IfEurope is to cease to be a source of world trouble and, indeed, if it is to retainany sort of place in the world, it must become, in some measure at least, a single and separate entity.On the sentimental side Europe, at any rate all that much of it as was oncewithin the confines of the Roman Empire or within the fold of Western Christen-dom, has a background of common tradition and culture. The consciousness of,this was much stronger when Europe still felt itself wreak as against Islam, andmay well grow again as Europe comes to realise its diminishing importance asagainst the outside world. The Pan-European movement commanded a very wideinterest all over Europe in pre-war years, even if its significance was largelyignored here. It is not for nothing that Hitler and Goebbels have increasinglytried to pose as champions of Europe against Russian Bolshevism and Anglo-Saxon pluto-democracy. However odious German domination may be, the ideaof Europe as a unit is being fostered and will gain strength. We can make no greater mistake than to ignore it, or to create the impression that we wish to restore the old European anarchy as a cover for an Anglo-American-Russianhegemony. European unity based on free co-operation, not on domination bya Herrewoolk, should be the most effective weapon in the whole armoury of our propaganda as the war draws near its close.The first and essential condition of any European polity, stable within and peaceful in its relation to the outside world, is that it should not be dominated by one of its component units. Germany will be terribly weakened after this war, far more than after the last, and have far less resilience. It may benecessary to deprive her of important territories like East Prussia and Silesia.In any case she will have to be kept in military impotence for a period long
enough to enable her neighbours to recover strength and .to build up new industries.More particularly it would seem of the greatest importance that those neigh-bours should, by federating, form States powerful enough to deal with her on a footing of equality. A federation of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, roumania and, possibly, Austria, with a Balkan Confederacy behind it, should, together witha revived France, presently constitute a more than adequate counterpoise to anyattempt to reassert German supremacy.An actual federal scheme for Europe as a whole, involving a surrender of sovereignty to a central Government, is hardly conceivable. But a looser union,more akin to our British Commonwealth, is at any rate within the bounds of possibility. It might be based on such things as a common declaration of civicand cultural rights for all the inhabitants of Europe, a common standing EuropeanConference, mutual economic arrangements as regards currency, tariffs, railway and air communications, and, possibly, a common Air Force to keep the European peace and a definite undertaking by the member States to send military contingentsto help enforce it.What elements would such a European polity comprise ?. Obviously, if itis to be ta voluntary association, it may not include the whole of the Continent.Spain and Portugal might possibly prefer to stay outside and foster the irrelations with South America, now only a few Jhours distant. Norway, andpossibly indeed the whole of Scandinavia, might prefer to work more closely withthe Anglo-Saxon Powers, to whose political outlook and social conditions theyare so closely akin.On the other hand, if the basis of the future European structure is to be notonly material interest, but a common European patriotism, a sense of Europe assomething characteristic and worth-while for its own sake, it must clearly not include elements of an entirely different cultural character, with dominatinginterests outside Europe, or inspired by a patriotism that is not centred in Europe.From that point of view neither Russia nor this country can become actualmembers of a European polity without destroying its whole effectiveness. russia is essentially an Asiatic Power whose centre is steadily shifting eastwards, and.its whole tradition is essentially different from that of Central and western europe. We belong to a world-wide Commonwealth which, after our own island,has the first and instinctive call on our patriotism. We can play an indispensablepart in getting the New Europe started. When it is started we can play a no less important part, as the link between it and America, perhaps also as a mediatorbetween it and Russia. But we cannot be an actual effective member so long as our main interests, our primary obligations and our instinctive loyalties areconcerned with our partners in the British Commonwealth. Still less wouldCanada or Australia wish to become a part of Europe. We, the British Common-weath, can no more be an actual part of a United Europe than we can be a partof. the United States or of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. We have agreater future before us than any of these other groups and a greater contributionto make to the peace of the world.It will at once be said that a Europe so united will inevitably come under german control and be an even greater menace to our existence than Germanyalone has proved herself. The answer I would give is that such a European unityas I have suggested (including also the colonies of the European countries con-cerned) would offer to a chastened and weakened Germany an outlet for her economic life and for the exercise of a peaceful influence in a freely-shared&quot; living space &quot; which alone can console her for defeat. On the other hand,failing such an opening, she is bound to try once more to reassert herself as amilitary power and, in a disorganised Europe, would be accepted this timereadily as a leader against outside interference. Europe is, indeed, bound byinherent conditions to come together sooner or later. The question is whether it comes together again under German leadership in a militant anti-foreign move-ment, or whether we use our victory to create a peace-loving, self-containedEuropean Commonwealth which will look back with goodwill upon those whohelped to set it on its feet. The former means a greater menace to this islandthan we have ever known; the latter may well live in permanent peace with usacross the Channel, just as the equally formidable United States have lived inpeace with us across the invisible border that separates them from Canada. Theworld is still far from perpetual peace. But it will be a great step forward ifthe Atlantic world, including Europe, attains to a state of settled self-containedcontent.
The practical conclusion I would commend to the War Cabinet is that theForeign Secretary, while emphasising as freely as he urges in his memorandum the part which he hopes the United Nations, and in particular the four leadingnations among them, should play in the general reconstruction after the war,should also, at the same time, indicate our hope that the nations of Europe may,within the wider framework of world international policy, come together into adefinite polity, based on free co-operation, both for the sake of their own peace and prosperity and for the contribution they would thus make to the peace and prosperity of the world.L.
