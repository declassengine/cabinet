The Norwegian-manned M.T.Bs. 620 and 623 entered Askevold Bay,north of Bergen, and torpedoed 2 ships of about 5.000 tons, which were leftsinking.All of the ships in the convoy from North Russia have now arrived in home waters with the exception of 1 ship torpedoed and 1 Russian ship stillunaccounted for.The Russian Icebreaker Mikoyan was damaged, probably by mine, in the entrance to the White Sea on the 26th.H.M. Minesweeper Sharpshooter was damaged in collision at Seidisfiord.Russian shore batteries sank 2 enemy ships, totalling 13,000 tons, in the approaches to Petsamo.Home Waters.3. H.M. Destroyers Quickmatch and Redoubt with H.M. Sloop Egret,escorting an outward-bound convoy, intercepted the Italian blockade-runnerCortellazzo (5,292 tons) on the 1st when 500 miles west of Cape Finisterre.The crew abandoned the ship, which had to be sunk owing to weather conditions.4. Early on the 1st a coastal convoy was attacked by at least 8 E-boats offStart Point. H.M. Trawler Jasper was sunk and 2 of the other escorts were damaged : there were 24 casualties. Two days later another convoy was attackedoff Start Point and H.M. Destroyer Penylan and a coaster were sunk.H.M. Trawler Finesse shot down a Focke-Wulf 190 in Lyme Bay on the 30th.Mediterranean.5. Late on the 1st, aircraft sighted and shadowed 3 enemy convoys off thenorth-west coast of Sicily. During the night some of the ships were intercepted by H.M. Cruisers Aurora, Argonaut and Sirius, with H.M. Destroyers Quiberonand Quentin. The enemy scattered, but 2 troopships, 2 merchantmen and3 destroyers were sunk. There &quot;were no casualties or damage in H.M. Shipsduring the engagement. Subsequently, however, attacks were made by enemy aircraft, and H.M. Destroyer Quentin was sunk : 90 per cent, of her ship&apos;scompany, including the captain, was picked up.Naval Albacores from Malta attacked a convoy off Kerkenah on the 2ndand torpedoed and sank 2 or&apos; possibly 3 ships of 5,000 tons. Destroyers from malta, sent to assist, subsequently sank a small T.B.D. which was picking upsurvivors.6. H.M. Submarines have reported the following attacks : P. 44 entered the harbour at Buerat el Hsun (Tripolitania) and shelled schooners, a small steamerand the pier on the 21st; Una sank a 4,000-ton ship, in a southbound convoy off cape Bon (Tunisia) on the 27th; P. 46 shelled a tug off Sirte; P. 35 sank a smallschooner by gunfire off the east coast of Tunisia on the 2nd and captured10 German air personnel.

Destroyer Ithuriel was damaged by bombing at Bone on the 28th.H.M. Minelayer Manxman was torpedoed north-east of Oran on the 1st, but wastowed to port.8. It is estimated that during the week some 21,000 tons of enemy merchantshipping Shave been sunk or seriously damaged by our aircraft.
Indian Ocean.9. The German s.s. Ramses (7,983 tons) on passage from Kobe to Germany,was intercepted by H.M. Australian Cruiser Adelaide and the Dutch CruiserHeemskerck about 700 miles south of Cocos Island on the 28th, and was scuttled.Ten Norwegian survivors of the s.s. A ust, believed lost by marine risk earlier inthe year, were rescued and 78 Germans were captured.10.   Troops were landed on the French island of Reunion on the 28th fromthe Fighting French Destroyer. Leopard.    There was some opposition, but the.Island surrendered on the 30th. &apos;11.   H.M. Submarine Trusty torpedoed a north-bound enemy ship of 9,000tons north of Penang on the 17th.Pacific.12. The Japanese continue their attempts to reinforce Buna with speciallanding parties from destroyers. Air attacks have forced them to avoid the routeacross the Coral Sea and to proceed round the north coast of New Britain and through the Dampier Straits,Two Japanese destroyers were damaged off New Guinea on the 29th by .S. Fortresses.Anti-Submarine Operations.13. A U-boat was sunk off Bone on the 28th by H.M. Destroyers Quentinand Quiberon. Fifteen other attacks were reported during the week : 10 by air-craft and 5 by surface craft. Of these, 4 were carried out in the Bay of Biscay,3 east of Newfoundland and 3 in the Mediterranean. Several of the attacksprobably caused damage, notably one by Corvettes south-east of the Azores and one by a Halifax aircraft in the Bay of Biscay.   It is now known that an Italiant U-boat of the Balilla class was hit by U.S. bombers during a raid on Tobruk on* the 7th November and was subsequently destroyed.Enemy Intelligence.German.14.   There is no change in the disposition of the German Fleet.The number of &quot;torpedo boats in Biscay ports has increased to a total of10 or 12.Italian.15. There has been very little supply traffic to Tripoli .(L) in the past week.J apanese.16. Two enemy heavy cruisers have been reported in the S.W. Pacific sincethe actions last month.U-boats.17. Although there has been remarkably little activity in the Gibraltar area and the Western Mediterranean during the week, there are signs of a renewal of operations by 8 or 10 U-boats between Gibraltar and Western Sardinia. Six ormore are estimated to be between Cape St. Vincent, Madeira and the Azores.The total number operating in the Atlantic is probably about 85.There are believed to be only 2 U-boats in the Indian Ocean and Capetownareas.Protection of Seaborne Trade.18. During the week ending the 29th/30th, 818 ships have been convoyed.Of these 156 were in ocean convoys and 662 in British coastal convoys. Sixty-three destroyers (including 3 U.S. destroyers) and 55 cutters and corvettes(including 2 U.S. cutters) have been employed on escort duties.During the week&apos;87 ships in 2 ocean convoys arrived in Home Waters, without loss. -[24706]b
19. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 28th totalled 341,194 tons, compared with 449,458 tons during theprevious 7 days, and an average of 569,083 tons for the past 10 weeks. Of theweek&apos;s imports 194,953 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.20. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked 12 ships, of *which 7 are known to have sunk. A ship was torpedoed in a homeward-boundCanadian convoy east of Newfoundland and a straggler from an outward-bound convoy was torpedoed off Nova Scotia. Three ships were attacked to the eastwardof the West Indies. A ship was sunk west of Freetown. Two ships bound fromthe Middle East to the Cape were sunk S.E. of Durban : the s.s. Llandaff Castle(10,799) with service personnel, from which 157 survivors out of a total of 310were rescued, and the s.s. Nova Scotia (6,796), with service personnel and Italianrefugees, of which 183 were picked up by a Portuguese sloop. In addition other ships were sunk and 1 torpedoed in this area and off the- Cape.E-boats sank a small coaster in a Channel convoy off Start Point .A Norwegian petrol-carrier, in an esatbound Mediterranean convoy, was sunk by air attack off Bougie.Shipping losses from enemy action during November are provisionallyestimated at 631,000 tons.British Minelaying.21. During the week surface craft laid mines off the Tunisian coast andoff the north coast of France.Aircraft also laid mines in the Mediterranean, and in areas from the Balticto the Bay of Biscay.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.22. So far as is known no minelaying by E-boats or aircraft occurred during &apos;the week in Home Waters.Enemy mines may have been laid off North Africa.Minesweeping is proceeding off Mersa Matruh. Three magnetic mines andone acoustic mine were destroyed off Tobruk. One magnetic mine was destroyedat Benghazi. Searched channels have been established at Benghazi and atPhilippeville.The mine totals are : 2,735 magnetic, 1,330 acoustic and 1,856 moored mines.4*Vichy French Intelligence.23. Early on the 27th, when the Germans entered Toulon, the crews ofthe French warships attempted to scuttle the fleet in harbour.Photographic reconnaissance shows that all of the important ships werescuttled or damaged except for two 6-inch cruisers and 2 contre-torpilleurs. Sixsubmarines were seen in dock, 4 others were scuttled and possibly 3 submerged.Some submarines escaped. Of these, the Iris is interned at Barcelona, GloHeucohas arrived in Oran in a damaged condition after calling at Valencia, Marsouinand Casabianca have reached Algiers and Venus and Diamant are stillunaccounted, for.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing operations in Russia and another of theStalingrad area are included in this Resume as insets.)The Russo-German Campaign.Central Sector.24. Taking advantage of the frost-hardened ground, the Russians launchedon or about the 25th November an offensive west of Moscow. There were two main areas of attack. First, by a thrust in a south-westerly direction from theToropets area they cut all the railways leading to Velikie Luki and now threaten the main north to south railway from Leningrad to the Ukraine. Secondly athrust south-eastward from the area west of Rzhev has severed the railwaylinking that town with Vyasma. The German forces in Rzhev can thereforenow be supplied only by road.   Over and above territorial objectives and the
taking of Rzhev would eliminate an important bastion of the German position which has provided a long-standing threat to Moscow the offensive has probablyone main purpose : to pin down the Germans in the Central Sector and so preventthe despatch of reinforcements to the Don bend.Voronezh Sector.25. The Germans appear apprehensive of a large-scale Russian attack inthe Voronezh area, and successful air action is claimed against Russian troop concentrations south-east of that town.Middle Don Sector.26. Extending their southward thrust from the Serafimovich area, theRussians have occupied the greater part of the Don bend enclosed on its westernside by the River Chir. The Germans still appear to hold a small bridgeheadinside the bend near the confluence of the Chir with the Lower Don. East ofthe Don bend a considerable German force the exact strength of which it isimpossible to estimate is encircled. The Russian thrust south-west of Stalin-grad has reached the Lower Don at a point north-north-west of Kotelnikov. Thetown is also threatened from the north-east.Caucasus Sector.27. The Russians continue to exert strong pressure in the areas west ofOrdjonikidze and north-east and north of Tuapse. Bad weather, however,appears to be causing supply difficulties on both sides.Summary.28. The Russian advance in the Middle Don area has for the time beingcome to a halt, owing in part to administrative difficulties, in part to heavy rainsthat have succeeded the earlier frosts. Between the Don and the Volga, however,the Russians are still pressing hard against the encircled German forces. TheGermans, for their part, have made no major attempt as yet to recover their lostpositions, a task in which they are likely to be hindered by the Russian offensive in the Central Sector.Tunisia.29. The pause imposed upon General Anderson while he built up hisreserves and made good his lines of&apos; communication ended on the night of the24th/25th November when First Army started: their advance eastwards.The advance was made from positions north of the line Le Kef-Zaghouanand was in two columns, one to the south from Beja in the direction of Tebourbaand the other to the north on the coast road from Djebel Aboid to Mateur. Inaddition, a British armoured force moving north-east from Souk El Arba hasassisted both columns in their advance. Progress generally has been steady butslow, being hindered by booby traps, the destruction of bridges and thecratering of roads. The attitude of the enemy has been mainly defensive andhis strength is estimated at 14,000 Germans, 7,500 Italians, and some 66 tanks.On the right the southern column captured Medjez El Bab on the 26th and continued on a north-easterly direction astride the road towards Tebourba.Meanwhile the central armoured force by the evening of the 26th had reached -a point between Tebourba and Mateur, and on the following day, after destroyingsome 40 aircraft on the landing ground at Djedeida, captured Tebourba. Itcompleted the occupation of the village with the aid of the southern column andon the same day successfully resisted a strong enemy counter-attack in the afternoon.30. To the north, the left column advanced steadily towards Mateur,commandos having previously carried out successful raids east of Djebel Aboid.The column initially encountered only slight opposition, capturing 200 prisoners and destroying several enemy tanks on the 25th. Axis forces are, however, still holding a strong point on a hill north of Jefna, 12 miles to the west of Mateur.This point is of some importance as it commands the Djebel Aboid-Mateur road.Our forces attacked it on the 30th but inconclusively.The southern column has since maintained strong pressure on Djedeida,15 miles to the south-west of Tunis, with the British armoured force in reserveat Chouigi.    The enemy, however, made a determined counter-attack on the[247061 b 2
1st December towards Tebourba from the north, using tanks and infantry-supported by dive-bombers. The armoured force in harbour,at Chouigi became involved in confused fighting and withdrew towards Tebourba, after sufferingsome casualties. An American armoured force, which had arrived in the forward area from Oran, moved east from Beja to clear up the situation and by eveningall enemy tanks had withdrawn northwards. The British armour was withdrawn to Medjez El Bab,31. On the southern flank British parachute troops were dropped in the areaof Pont Du Fahs on the 29th November and were reported to have capturedOudna, 12 miles to the south of Tunis, on the 30th.Further south a mixed American-French force based on Tebessa had beenpatrolling offensively eastwards towards Gafsa, Gabes and Kairouan.Libya.32. On the 24th November our armoured formations had reached a pointhalf-way between Jedabya and Mersa El Brega, and from that date to the1st December only intermittent contact has been maintained with the enemy. Bothlight and heavy armoured formations have followed the enemy up to his preparedpositions in the line Mersa El Brega-Bir El Ginn-Maaten Giofer-Marada andare in observation. The bulk of the infantry are moving up and their advancedelements by the 30th had reached a point midway between Jedabya andMersa El Brega. On the 29th and the two following days there was an increasein our patrol activity to the east and south-east of the enemy&apos;s positions.The enemy has been observed to be digging actively and a considerableconcentration of. light.A.A. equipment has been observed. It appears that theenemy will make a determined stand in his present position.33. Bardia, Tobruk, Derna and Benghazi harbours have now been put intooperation and the volume of stores handled is considered most satisfactory, asis the speed with which repairs have already been carried out. A further expansion of their capacity is to be expected. Railhead has been advanced toTobruk with a most satisfactory capacity, and repairs to various water supplies which suffered through enemy demolitions are well in hand. Vehicle evacuationis proceeding smoothly.34. Amongst the mass of stores captured are 13,300 tons British and 16,500tons German ammunition and over 500,000 Jerrycans (the latest type of Germannon-leaking petrol container, holding about&apos;4 gallons).Burma.35. In the Ffukawng valley (northern Burma) Shingbwiyang has been evacuated by the rebel Burmese as a result of bombing by U.S. aircraft. Inthe Arakan coastal area there have been some successful minor patrol actionsagainst the Japanese, who have made no attempt to advance north of Maundgdaw-Buthidaung.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.36. Enemy resistance continues in the narrow coastal strip from Gona toBuna. Our forward elements entered the village of Buna on the 30th November,while another column has reached a point approximately 1\ miles from Sananandaon the main road. A third is dealing with the remaining enemy resistance in thevicinity of Gona and closing in on Sanarianda from the north-west. The Alliednumerical superiority at the decisive point owes much to air transport of reinforcements and supplies.Solomons.37. U.S. forces on Guadalcanal continue to make steady progress againstthe Japanese in the north-west corner of the Island .A leutians.38. The Japanese have reoccupied Attu, the western-most island of theAleutians Group.
Intelligence.France.39. A final estimate of the German forces in Vichy France cannot yet begiven. It is confirmed that S.S. Division Reich is there, but it now seems probablethat 6th Panzer Division is still in the Rennes area. A report has been received that 10th Panzer Divison has left the Marseilles area for Italy, and it is thoughtthat it may be going to Tunisia.Italy.40. The despatch of Italian troops to Tunisia is believed to have-continued throughout the week, and there is now probably the equivalent of a weak division in that region.  Inside Italy also troop movements are believed, to be continuing.AIR SITUATION.General Review.41.   Bomber Command aircraft made a heavy and successful raid on Turin.Our aircraft heavily attacked enemy harbours and airfields in Tunisia.Successful attacks were again made on enemy shipping in the Mediterranean.United Kingdom.42.   Fighter Command flew 553 defensive sorties by day and 200 by night.Enemy activity was again on a small scale.   Seventeen enemy aircraft flew over this country by day and 4 by night.   Two of the former were destroyed.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.43. The offensive activity of our fighters and fighter-bombers has been almost entirely restricted to harassing enemy communications in northern france and. the Low Countries. A large number of goods trains and locomotiveswas attacked and, of the latter, at least 40 were either destroyed or damaged.In addition, about 20 barges and small craft were either sunk or damaged. Inthese operations, 3 enemy aircraft were destroyed; 7 of ours- are missing.Two Bostons made a successful low level attack on the Iron and Steel works at Ijmuiden, obtaining hits on the coke oven plant. -Only 7 small fighter sweeps were undertaken and, except on one occasionwhen 3 F.W.190s were destroyed, no enemy opposition was encountered.Night.44. A force of 112 bombers was despatched to Frankfurt which was difficultto locate accurately owing to a heavy ground haze. The 77 aircraft which attacked dropped 193 tons of H.E. and incendiaries but results generally wereunobserved apart from a number of scattered fires.   Six aircraft failed to return.Thirtysseven Intruders, of which 2 are missing, operated over France andBelgium.  Five railway centres in Belgium and several trains were attacked.Northern Italy.45. Two night attacks have been made on Turin. In the first, which wascarried out in clear weather, 85 per cent, of the 228 aircraft despatched, attacked;370 tons of incendiaries and H.E. (including 2 x 8,000 lbs.) were dropped.Visual identification of landmarks and illumination from the Pathfinders&apos;flares enabled most crews to pin-point the target and tlhe attack, which was completed in 75 minutes, was successful and well concentrated, particularly near the Royal Arsenal. Many fires, some extremely large, were seen burning inthe centre, north-west and south-west of the town. Several hits were made onthe Fiat works which was the specific target for part of the force.The second attack was on a small scale, severe icing conditions on the outward journey forced many aircraft to jettison their bombs. Over Turin itselfthere was a dense haze but the majority of the bombs from the 17 aircraft which attacked are believed to have fallen in built-up areas of the town.From these operations 4 aircraft are missing.
Coastal Operations.46. The Commands flew a total of 588 offensive sorties and a further533. sorties on protection of shipping.Sightings of enemy,shipping were few and of these the majority were in thesouthern part of the Bay of Biscay, where 13 attacks were made but no hits areclaimed. A Hudson made one hit on a ship in convoy off Texel.A total of 76 aircraft laid 107 sea-mines in enemy waters.From the week&apos;s operations 18 of our aircraft are missing, including9 Beaufighters which failed to return from patrols off the Brest Peninsula andwhich were probably lost in combats with Ju. 88s or Arado 196s; two of thelatter were destroyed.Mediterranean.French North Africa.47. Our Air Forces based on Malta and French North Africa continued to concentrate their attacks on enemy harbours and airfields in Tunisia and gavefull support to our troops in the forward area.Bizerta docks were attacked on 6 nights of the week by Wellingtons from malta, about 90 tons of H.E. bombs being dropped on the target, A. daylight attack was made by 33 U.S. Fortresses. Considerable damage was caused torailways, jetties, fuel dumps, dockside buildings and barracks. Wellingtons also bombed Tunis harbour.  Beauforts laid mines at the entrances to both harbours.Fortresses and Bisleys successfully attacked Sidi Ahmed airfield (Bizerta)and El Aouina airfield (Tunis). Hangars were hit and 12 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground.Beaufighters from Malta attacked road and rail transport on the coast roadsof Tunisia and Tripoli. Two southbound goods trains were attacked near Sousse,both engines being hit and wagons set on fire. A westbound road convoy was attacked between Sirte and Misurata and several lorries were destroyed.U.S. Lightnings and Marauders raided the harbours and railways at Sfaxand Gabes; Havocs. and Lightnings continuously attacked enemy vehicles inthe Djedeida area.Beaufighters flew armed reconnaissance patrols against transport aircraftbetween North Africa and Sicily.  At least 8 enemy aircraft were destroyed.Our aircraft also maintained reconnaissance and offensive patrols over allsectors and provided escorts for shipping. At times heavy air fighting developed.In one combat our fighters, 7 of which are missing, destroyed 12 enemy aircraft,probably destroyed 13 and damaged 22.Enemy operations were on an increased soale. Bombing attacks were madeby Ju. 87s. and F.W. 190s. on Souk El Arba and Bone airfields and roads in theMedjez El Bab and Beja areas. Long-range bombers from Sicily and Sardiniacontinued their attacks against the harbours and airfields of Bone and Bougie.In one raid on Bone airfield, 5 out of 8 Ju. 88s. which attacked were shot down.Minelaying was suspected in Algiers Bay.Malta and Sicily. 048.   During the week Malta-based aircraft flew 700 sorties.Wellingtons and bomb-carrying Spitfires attacked airfields in Sicily;runways, hangars and aircraft pens were hit. Beauforts laid mines in the entrance to Palermo Harbour. ,Reconnaissances were made of enemy harbours and airfields and of extensiveareas of the Mediterranean.  Protection was also provided for shipping.A few enemy aircraft attempted to raid Malta but they were turned backby our fighters before they reached the Island.Egypt, Libya and Tripolitania.49.   Allied aircraft flew 993 sorties during the week.Tripoli (L) Harbour was attacked twice by day and twice by night by U.S.and R.A.F. Liberators, over 80 tons of H.E. bombs being dropped on the target.Two ships, the Electricity Power Station, the Moles and an A.A. post were hit.Another Liberator bombed Horns (L) Harbour, where a ship was hit and capsized.Wellingtons laid mines off Buerat El Hsun in the Gulf of Sidra.
The Marble Arch landing ground (40 miles west of El Agheila) was bombedpy 15 Wellingtons. Several enemy aircraft were destroyed or damaged on theground.Our fighters carried out reconnaissance and offensive patrols over the forward area, escorted transport aircraft and provided protection for shipping betweenthe Delta and Benghazi.Enemy operations were on an increased scale and were chiefly directed against supply traffic and.troops in the Jedabya and Benghazi areas. Reconnais-sance over the front was maintained by Me. 109s.Dodecanese Islands.50. Seven U.S. Fortresses dropped over 10 tons of H.E. bombs on the floatingdry dock in Leros Island.  Two ships were probably hit.Gibraltar.51. One hundred and eighty-nine anti-U-boat patrols and convoy escortsorties were flown by our aircraft.  Ten U-boats were sighted and 6 were attacked.A Hacks on Enemy Shipping.52.   Beaufighters from Malta attacked the following! (a) A southbound ship of 1/2,000 tons off Pantellaria.   The ship was set on fire.(b) A southbound ship of 1,000 tons off the Tunisian coast.   The ship caughtfire and subsequently blew up.(c) A schooner and a 1,200-ton ship off the Tunisian coast.   Both were hit by cannon and machine-gun fire..53.   Naval Albacores attacked the following :-(a) A 7,000-ton tanker which was torpedoed and set on fire off the west coast of Sicily.(&amp;) A convoy consisting of 2 ships of 5,000 tons, 1 cruiser, 1 destroyer and asloop east of the Kerkenah Islands. The 2 ships were sunk and a third vessel was possibly sunk.Russia.54. On the Northern Front the Russian Air Force again raided Helsinki.An enemy airfield near Volkov was heavily attacked twice, &apos;and a large numberof German aircraft were destroyed or damaged on the ground.On the Central Front air activity was considerably hampered by bad weather.In the Stalingrad area the Russian Air Force concentrated on cutting offsupplies from the surrounded German 6th Army. In the last few days 122 Ju. 52swere claimed as shot down.In spite of very bad weather, Russian aircraft were very active in theCaucasus. Enemy targets in the Alagir, Nalchik and Tuapse areas were heavily bombed.There are indications that the German Air Force in Russia is inadequate to afford more than the absolute minimum of. support for the army except inrelatively narrow sectors. A great effort was, however, made to attackconcentrations of Russian troops and communications behind the lines.During the week ending the 28th November the Russians claim 234 german aircraft destroyed against 97 of their own.Burma.55. Our aircraft (Blenheims, Wellingtons, Hurricanes and Bisleys) made11 attacks on enemy airfields, but no important results are reported.China.56. U.S. Mitchells, with fighter escort, made 2 successful attacks on shipping in the Canton area. Three ships totalling 21,000 tons and severallighters were sunk. The Tien Ho and White Cloud airfields were also attacked,many aircraft on the ground being set on fire. In combat, at least 15 enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of 2 U.S. fighters.Other targets attacked included the docks at Hankow, and objectives atSienning (50 miles S. of Hankow) and Yoyang (Hunan Province).
Thailand.57. Nine U.S. Mitchells bombed the oil refinery at Bangkok; bursts were observed near the power house.Indo-China.- - 58. The power station at Hongay was hit and coal storage depots atCampha were set on fire by escorted U.S. bombers.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.59. Strong forces of Allied aircraft continued to give support to our land forces by attacking enemy positions in the Buna/Gona area. Lae airfield was attacked on 5 occasions and several enemy aircraft on the ground were destroyed.U.S. Fortresses damaged 2 of a force of 4 destroyers, which were passing through the Vitiaz Straits. On the following day an enemy naval force, believed to be attempting to land reinforcements in the Buna area,, was attacked by allied aircraft and forced to withdraw; 23 of the escorting enemy aircraft were shot down.  Allied air losses were light.Enemy aircraft, of which 6 were destroyed by Kittyhawks, have been more active than of late, but, apart from the destruction of a bridge crossing theAmboga River, no serious damage is reported.Timor.60. Beaufighters made a successful surprise raid on Koepang airfield, where18 enemy bombers and 3 fighters were destroyed or damaged on the ground bycannon and machine-gun fire.Solomons.61. U.S. bombers, attacking a convoy north of Guadacanal, made 5 hits on one of the cargo ships and shot down 3 enemy fighters.Australia.62.

The above tjable is an aggregation of the material in the employment tables of non-tankers and tankers in Statistical Digests E and F respectively. in combining the figures for non-tankers with those for tankers, certain slight differences have had to be brought into a common form. The figures for non-tankers relateto the last day of the month while those for tankers relate to the 15th of the rrionth to February 1942 and to the last day of the month from March 1942.(1) (a) Tankers on Admiralty service include vessels importing oil fuel to the United Kingdom; in October 1942 these comprised 29 tankers of 232,000 gross tons.(b) Non-tankers allocated to the fighting services which are under repair are excluded from this column.   All tankers on Admiralty service are, however, included.(c) A substantial part (in recent months nearly one-half) of the tonnage in these columns brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage (see note (3)).(2) These columns give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair. They do not,therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward voyages to the Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries other than United Kingdom and Eirets3
