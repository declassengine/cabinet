The War Cabinet emphasised that these discussions &quot; should be ofan exploratory nature only,&quot; and that the Chiefs of Staff should &quot; make it clearthat we appreciated the great potential importance of the suggestions made bythe French Authorities.&quot;2. We proceeded to Paris on Tuesday, the 30th January. Immediately on arrival, we had a, meeting with the British representatives on the Allied military committee, who had arrived in Paris on the previous day, and had already hadan exploratory discussion with their French colleagues. We learned from them the salient features of the French proposals, and were thus able to discuss themamongst ourselves in some detail before meeting the French High Command.3. On Wednesday, the 31st January, we attended a meeting at general gamelin&apos;s Headquarters. The French High Command were represented byGeneral Gamelin, Admiral Darlan and General Vuillemin.4. We emphasized at the outset that the object of our visit was not to reachhard-and-fast conclusions, but to learn precisely what the French had in mind,in order that we might be able to report to the British War Cabinet. general gamelin then gave us a general exposition of the French project, and we offered a number of preliminary observations. The discussion revealed a divergence-Ofopinion between us on certain questions of principle; and it appeared torus thatcertain features of the French project lacked precision. We therefore suggested,on the conclusion of a long meeting, that we should prepare a Paper, setting out,on the one hand, the French proposals, as we understood them to be, and, on theother, our own comments thereon.   The French agreed to this suggestion.5. We accordingly prepared the Paper, which is reproduced in columns 1and 2 of the Annex to this Report; and this formed the basis of discussion at ameeting held early the following morning, the 1st February.f fi?&apos;- T!le -Frendil High Command said that they accepted our interpretationoi their proposals as set out in Column 1 of the Annex, and that they were in.* W.M.

agreement with many of our comments. On others they put forward a series ofobservations. These are set out in column 3 of the Annex, which thus, we hope,presents a fairly complete picture both of what the French have in mind, and ofour own views. Thus this paper supersedes the report on Allied assistance to finland which we submitted on the 28th January, 1940 (Paper No. W.P. (40) 36)in the form of a commentary on certain proposals received from the French forthe employment of Polish forces at Petsamo.:i 7.: In the following paragraphs we invite attention to certain specific points which, emerge from the exchange of views between ourselves and the Frenchsummarised in the Annex : Hostilities with Russia.8. At the first meeting, the French appeared to make light of theconsequences that might flow from hostilities with Russia, In fact, they appearedalmost to welcome the prospect on the reasoning that: (a) So long as the Soviet were fully occupied in Finland, they could not beof much help to Germany; and,,(&amp;) It would give us an opportunity of bombing the oil supply at Baku,and thus eliminate the chances of Russia being able to spare oil for germany.At the second meeting, we made a point of asking whether our observations on the disadvantages of hostilities with Russia (see Annex, Column 2, paragraph 3), had caused the French to modify their views. General Gamelin repliedthat in his opinion Russia&apos;s entry into the war had both advantages and disadvantages. He made no comment on the embarrassment which we might be caused in India and Iran, beyond saying that a good deal depended on Russia&apos;soffensive capacity, which he himself rated fairly low. He added that if and whenit became certain that there would be no attack on the Western Front in the spring, there was much to be said for opening up new fields of operation. Thiswould enable us to mystify the German High Command, cause them to dispersetheir forces and bring in new allies on our own side. In addition there was agood deal to be said, from the point of view of the morale of the troops, for putting an end to the present stalemate on land.The Infringement of Norwegian Neutrality.9. It will be seen from the Annex, Column 1, paragraphs 9 and 10, that naval operations at. Petsamo are dependent on the establishment of a base in norwegian territorial waters, possibly in some lonely fjord; and that the Frenchconsider that the establishment of such a base can be justified as action taken insupport of League of Nations&apos; resolution to help Finland.This is, of course, a matter for political judgment, but it seems to us that, ifwe are going to invoke Article 16* of the Covenant, it would be infinitelypreferable, from the military point of view, to do so for the purpose of obtainingan entry into Scandinavia via Narvik. When we put this point to the French,they suggested that there was a big difference between infringing the neutrality of a recognised port, and that of a lonely fjord : but they made it clear on several occasions during the discussion (see, for example, Annex, Column 3, paragraphs 3.4 and 10), that they preferred the Narvik project and that their only reasonfor suggesting the Petsamo operation was that it seemed impossible on political grounds to obtain an entry into Finland via Narvik and Lulea.Volunteers for Finland.10. A successful landing at Petsamo is dependent upon Finnish co-operation,and the Finns could not spare sufficient effectives for this purpose, unless their* Extract from Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.The Members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually support one another inthe financial and economic measures which are taken under this Article, in order to minimise the loss and inconvenience resulting from the above measures, and that they will mutually&apos;sup&apos;port one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by tlieCovenant-breaking State, and that they will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of the Members of the League which are co-operating toprotect the Covenants of the League.
forces in Central Finland were reinforced by some three to four divisions of volunteers infiltrated through Sweden (see Annex, Column 1, paragraph 12),We could get no clear idea from General Gamelin at the first meeting as to where these three or four divisions of volunteers were to come from. We therefore thought it right to press the point at the second meeting. General Gamelin could give us no definite reply. He said that there were a number of foreign residentsin France, some of them &quot; stateless,&quot; who could not be used in the french army,but might, if his Government permitted, be allowed to volunteer for Finland.He gave no idea of numbers or of where the equipment was to come from; and heconcluded, with the observation that the solution of the problem depended ohwhether the efforts of all countries wishing to help Finland could be made effective.Meeting of the Supreme War Council.11. On the conclusion of the second meeting we told the French that we proposed to render an early report to the British War Cabinet on their project for assistance to Finland. We suggested, and they agreed, that the problem called for early examination by the Supreme War Council.12. They also agreed that, if as a result of such examination, the Frenchand British Governments were to decide - that preparations for the Petsamoenterprise should be proceeded with, the following are some of the measures whichshould be undertaken as a matter of urgency : -(a) A joint Franco-British  study of administrative arrangements and operational plans.(b) The preparation and concentration of the Petsamo Expeditionary Force.(c) Close  consultation  with  the  Finnish  General   Staff.    This  would necessitate the very early despatch of French and British Staff officers to Finland.(Signed) DUDLEY POUND.EDMUND IRONSIDE.R. E. C.

We agree, subject to the proviso that any action we take to help Finland is strictly related to our main object the defeat of Germany.French observations on BritishComments in Column 2 * fasexpounded at Meeting onFebruary 1, 1940).1. We wholly agree that theultimate aim is the defeat ofGermany. Everything must beconsidered from that angle.2. If it is to be, effective assis-tance to Finland will probablyinvolve hostilities with Russia.2. We2. No comment.8. The issue raised by theabove is a political one, but,from the military point ofview, the consequences can beaccepted.4. Norwegianopinion    is   not and Swedishis not yet ripe for direct intervention through their countries. Allied intervention in finland would, however, stiffenand encourage them, and might ultimately secure their co-opera-tion.5. The only entry which isimmediately available into Fin-land is Petsamo.6. It is agreed that our ulti-mate objective should be theoccupation of Gallivare, butthere is no need to take adecision on this point for themoment. Plans and preparationsmust, however, be completed inevery detail to enable us totake advantage of any opportun-ity that may arise.7. The Petsamo operation isnot one which could be under-taken light-heartedly. All its implications would require themost   careful  examination,  and3. We take a very seriousview of flie implications ofhostilities with Russia. Apartfrom the dispersal of our naval forces that would be involved,there would be serious reper-cussions in India and Iran.These countries would demandfighter aircraft and A.A.: artillery,which could be supplied only, atthe expense, of the western front or of England. In general,we would be prepared to recom-rnend the risk of hostilities withRussia for the sake of a greatprize, such as Gallivare; but not otherwise.4. The British Foreign Officepredict precisely the oppositeeffect. They think the more successful our action in aid ofthe Finns, the more will norway and Sweden retire into theirshell of neutrality. Even if this estimate is incorrect, the fact remains that, in order to fore-stall the Germans at Gallivare,we ought to land at Narvik bythe end of March. Conse-quently, there would be no timefor t-he Petsamo venture to haveinfluenced Scandinavian opinion in our favour.5. We agree.6. We agree. But if we areto forestall the Germans wemust occupy Gallivare beforethe Gulf of Bothnia is free ofice. (The earliest date on whichthis has occurred is on the26th April.)7. We agree with the broadconception of the operations,and particularly with theopinion that they cannot beundertaken light-heartedly.   We3. We entirely agree. Thereis no war or operation of warunattended by risk. We haveidentical views that our essentialinterest is to obtain possessionof the mines-at Gallivare.4. The French High Com-mand is not in a position to appreciate what attitude wouldbe adopted by Norway and sweden. We agree that, if thesituation allows of the seizure ofGallivare before the ice melts inthe Gulf of Bothnia, there is every advantage in doing so.5. No comment.6. We agree.No comment.

Even though they may not be veryefficient, opposition to them will be limited to seaborne,tighter aircraft and A.A.(inns in the vicinity of theport.(d) Complete lack of localtransport.(r) The only really mobiletroops in the Allied contin-gent are the ChasseursAlpius.French observations on BritishComments in Column 2 (asexpounded at Meeting on,February 1, 1940).8. The object of the operations would be to rid Northern Finlandof Russian Forces.8. The operation is a gamble,but we agree that it is not impossible to eject Kussianforces . from Northern Finlandprovided that :  (ft) There is a first-classCommander and tirst-classtroops.(/)) The Finns co-operate effectively.(c) It is possible to starve theRussians out of Murmanskby severing their oonimuni-cations to the southwards,eg., at Kandalaksha, and toestablish a base at Mur-mansk which will supportmuch larger forces than canbe maintained from Petsamo.(.&apos;/) The operations are com-pleted by May. After may the situation becomes un-predictable. (See para-graph 13 (/)).)8. No comment, but we draw attention to what we have said,namely, that Marshal Manuer-heim considers that he can holdout only by reducing the widthof his active front throughclearing up his front in Lapland(Northern Finland). There is nodoubt that Finnish troops are totake part in these operations.It is clearly necessary that operations must be completed before seasonal conditionsenable the Russians to increase their efforts.it Naval operations are depen-dent on the establishment of abase iu Norwegian territorial waters possibly in some lonelyfiord.9. We agree9. No comment.10. The establishment of sucha base can be justified as actiontaker, in support of the Leagueof Nations Resolution to helpFinland.10. We doubt whether thiswill carry much weight with the norwegians and Swedes, or even with the British Dominions. Tf,however, we are going to invoke article XVI of the Covenant ofthe. League, it would be. prefer a-ble, and no less logical, to employ these arguments toobtain an entry into Scandinavia10. There can be no doubtthat the only reason why we are limited to the Petsamo operation is because we cannot see our way to assisting Finland over the narvik-Lulea line. If we could use the latter then the Petsamoplan could be reduced to naval operations combined possibly with a small landing.

Should the Finns fail tosecure an unopposed landing forthe Allied forces at Petsamo, thelatter would have to land in a neighbouring Norwegian fjord,e*g..,\ Kirkenes.12. In order to enable the finns to put in this attack tothe northward, their forces in central Finland would have tobe reinforced by some three to four divisions of volunteersinfiltrated through Norway and sweden.1 !. This would be an infringe-meiit of Norwegian Neutrality,and we would prefer to useNarvik (see 10 above).11. It is perhaps a less seriousoffence to land at a lonely fjordthan at Narvik. The Britishand French Governments willhave to give a decision on thispoint.12. We agree. Marshal Man-nerheim&apos;s request for personnelamounts to some 30,000 men.They must be trained men.Their organization and equip-nieiit in Finland would bedifficult.i 12. We think that the whole1 question is whether the effortsI of all countries wishing to helpI Finland can be made effective.13. It is thought that norway and Sweden would raise noobjection to the passage of thesevolunteers, but the difficulty would be to find them.13. We do not see wheresuitable volunteers are coming from; and even if Norway and sweden raised no objection totheir passage, there are twodangers to be apprehended:  (a) The Germans may at anytime bring such pressure tobear on the Swedes as to compel them to stop thepassage of personnel andmaterial. All that had passed through might thus be isolated.(b) At any time after earlyMay when the Gulf ofBothnia is open, and afterearly June when the WhiteSea is open, the germans and the Russians could landsuperior forces in finland and turn the Finnishdefence.13. We agree, and for that reason we think that action should be taken as soon aspossible.14. On the question of air, itis hoped that the Finns would beable to provide sufficient fighter aircraft to cover the originallanding and subsequent opera-tions in the Petsamo area.14. The Prussian air threat to finland may intensify and we donot think the Finns will be ableto spare any fighters for this area. We are apprehensive ofthe consequences of leaving ourforce without any allied air support in the face of the con-siderable Russian striking force which can threaten it after thethaw. We do not consider thatthe situation at this time couldpermit the withdrawal of anyFighter Squadrons or Anti-Aircraft guns from Great Britainor France.14. This question requiresdiscussion with Marshal Manner-heim. We think we should beable to give some help by sending material and personnel(especially Poles). There is nodoubt that the air operations aiPetsamo, especially the bomber and Fighter operations, will need careful planning.15. The projected operations would give us the use of certainFinnish aerodromes from which british   bombers   could   bomb15.
