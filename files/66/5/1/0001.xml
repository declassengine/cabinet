THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOYERNMENTEnclosure A.MOST SECRET &apos; Copy No.    2 4TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY,It Is requested that speoial care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.NOTES ON SIR ARCHIBALD SINCLAIR&apos;S VISIT TO SCAPA FLOW,JANUARY 2-3, 1940.Essential Requirements.1. TO make Scapa Flow a secure base for the Fleet four things are necessary;in order of importance they are : \a) Water Defences.\b) Fighter Aeroplanes.(c) A.A. Guns (Light and Heavy), Searchlights, and Balloons or Kites.(d) Land Defence.The only difference of opinion and it was not strong was as to the degreeof relative importance of (b) and (a). I mention (d) because it ought not to be ignored, but it is much less important than (a), (b) or (c).2. Water Defences.(a) Blocked Channels.I accompanied Admiral Lyster in the Yacht Jasper on a close inspection ofKirk, Skerray, Weddel and Water Sounds, and I saw the block ships in Burr a sound (between Hoy and Graemsay) from a distance.(i) Kirk Sound through which Captain Prien probably entered.  The holenear the centre of the channel is now squarely blocked by a big shipnewly placed there. A small gap exists between that ship and theship next to the Mainland, but to work through that gap would involvemaking two sharp turns and that would almost certainly be impossible at night, even at the turn of the tide, and quite impossible when thetide is surging through the gap. There is also a gap between the blockships and Lamb Holm, but the water is getting shallow there so the gap is narrow, but is about to be filled.(ii) Skerray a/ad Weddel Sounds. These sounds seem well blocked now, butto make sure an extra ship or two is to be sunk between the presentblock ships and the land at one or two points.(iii) Water Sound. A small gap exists here between the block ships andBurray, but it is about to be filled. Moreover, the new boom, whenplaced between Flotta and Hunda, will be an additional obstacle toentry from Water Sound.(iv) Burra Sound. The block ships are clearly in position on the east sideof the channel, and the reefs marked on the chart seem to block thewest side effectively. But Burra Sound only leads into Hoy Sound,across which a boom is now in position, and which will soon be other-wise protected.(v) Guns and searchlights are, or very soon will be, in position at each lineof block ships.[20642] B
I was bold that the guns would be 12-pounder guns, and it did not occur to meto question whether these would be effective against submarines. Admiral Raikes(Northern Patrol), however, with whom I lunched at Kirkwall just before leaving the islands, and who has served in submarines, doubts whether they would be strong enough to damage a submarine unless they happened to hit it at the base ofthe conning tower. Perhaps the most that could be expected of them would be tomake a noise and thus to bring other means of defence into operation !(b) Booms, Loops and Minefields.It is unnecessary for me to describe where the booms now are and where thenew ones are to be constructed and the loops, and minefields and stationary asdicslaid. Let me only assure you that I saw signs of the energy and speed withwhich this work this gigantic work, for the Flotta-Hunda boom alone will be nearly three miles long is being pushed forward.The City of Manchester was lying in the Flow her belly full of mines, asI was told. I saw the site of the proposed mine depot at St. Margaret&apos;s Hope. Isawr the booms now in position and a new one or a substantial part of it on the quay at Lyness waiting to be put aboard a boom-ship. Yesterday morningas I left Lyness three boom-ships were moving to and from the base.(c) Patrols.Armed trawlers patrol in front of the booms and blocked channels and lightercraft, of which our yacht was one, armed only with depth charges, patrol thePlow behind. They can only steam at 8 knots and, if they did drop a depthcharge or two, it would probably be the end of them, whatever might happen to the submarine ! Again, however, there would be a noise and other craftwould hasten to the scene.(d) The Coastal Batteries.Most of the gun positions in the last war were deliberately demolished someyears ago. I visited the gun positions and the naval advanced defence head-quarters and signal station) at Stanger Head (Flotta) and found that the guns were already in position and could be fired, but that the platforms, magazines,ammunition hoists, &amp;c, are very far from being finished, although the work isbeing pushed on.I also visited the battery position at Hoy Sound which is in a much more advanced stage although the ammunition hoist is not yet finished nor is the lighting for the magazine yet installed- the ammunition would now have to beshifted by the light of lanterns, but the electric light should be installed within two or three weeks.(e) Motor-Torpedo Boats.When the above defences are complete the Base should be as secure as navalskill and foresight can make it against submarine attack, and against attack by destroyers or larger surface vessels. It would not be equally secure against attack by fast motor-torpedo boats.The difficulty of getting such boats into position to attack, even with the help of boat-carrying ships, under the eyes of our naval and air patrols inthe North Sea, would clearly be immense, and the boats would undoubtedly sufferheavily if, indeed, any survived at all. The risk, however, that, in a fog or in along winter night, and at high water, an attack in large numbers might be made and that a very few boats might penetrate the defences, is one which those whoare responsible for the defence of the Flow think it very difficult to eliminate.(f) Date of Completion of Water Defences.Admirals Binney and Lyster, and their staffs, are still aiming at the com-pletion of these Water Defences by the end of this month, but there are seriousfactors making for delay :  (i) A ccidents which are unavoidable, like the sinking of the Pandora on herway up to block one of the channels,(ii) Piers. Much more serious.  Piers, like gun positions, were demolishedThese are  now  in   some years ago.   The construction of new piers and the extension ofShttti * It   ?J7d ones into deep water are necessary for the service both of thethe   various   sections   Water and of the Air Defences.are   completed. A.   H.(Civil Lord).
(iil)ii) Labour. Many of the workmen appear to have ieft after the air raids.Just now the labour force is heavily depleted by 50 to 75 per cent,by the New Year holidays, but it is hoped that they will return thisweek or at the beginning of next week.We discussed the possibility of forming Naval Labour Battalionswhich would work under discipline, but that policy would be difficultto combine (except, perhaps, for work which the Naval authorities could do themselves without employing a contractor) with the policywhich has, in fact, just been adopted, of calling in Messrs. Balfour,Beattie to take over the whole of the naval contract work (apart fromthe oil depot at Lyness), I was told that this firm is confident thatthey will be able to mobilise sufficient labour to make rapid progress with the work.This point has^ bean It seems to me that, from the standpoint of attracting labour to%eciai&quot;aiiowaneerao&quot; the islands, it is much less important to increase the hourly wage (forI additional 2is. per at this time of year a man working on hourly wages may be able toobtain very few hours&apos; work in a week) than to secure for him a certain minimum weekly wage out of which, after paying his contractor as hehas to do, for his board and lodging in his hutment, he will have, atany rate, something left over at the end of the week to send home tohis dependents.Taking everything into account, and impressed as I was by the drive and determination of Admiral Lyster to get the work on the Water Defencessubstantially finished by the end of the month, I do not feel qualified to assertthat he will fail to perform what would seem to my uninstructed eye to be a miracle.I should have thought, however, that the middle or end of February would be asafer date on which to calculate.3. Fighters.The Skuas and Rocs at Hatston and Wick are quite inadequate as fighterprotection for Scapa Flow; 240 m.p.h. is about their limit. Therefore, theprincipal requirements from the standpoint of active air defence are :  (a) A Hurricane (or Spitfire) Squadron at ELatston which could be accomodated as soon as it is available. Hatston is quite a goodaerodrome with fine concrete run-ways.(6) Two Hurricane Squadrons at Wick. Unfortunately, however, Wickaerodrome has got no concrete run-ways and is engulfed in mud and water. Not that it would be a good plan to build concrete run-waysat Wick. To start building them before the ground has been properlydrained indeed, before the summer has hardened the ground would,in the present condition of the aerodrome, almost put it out of use, andNo. 269 Squadron of reconnaissance machines is doing importantanti-submarine patrol work which could not, I imagine, at any time; be dispensed with.   Indeed, if and when the ground is properlydrained, I understand that the fighters would prefer grass to concreterun-ways. The improvement of Wick aerodrome is substantiallya labour problem similar to, but rather worse (although on a smaller scale) than, the problem in Orkney. Nevertheless, if the Fleet air arm Squadron is withdrawn from Wick, it is estimated that twoHurricane Squadrons could be accommodated there in the middle ofMarch.(c) A new aerodrome is to be built at Castletown near Thurso.   Not a sodhas yet been turned, but it is hoped that accommodation might beavailable there in summer conditions for a Squadron or two by theend of July.(d) The R.D.F. Station near Kirkwall is to be supplemented by others atSunburgh Head in the Shetlands, and at Thrumster (5 miles southof Wick). It should not be long before these Stations are ready, andobviously they will enormously increase the effectiveness of the FighterDefence, which, by the middle or end of March, should be formidable.[20642] B 2
4. A.A. Guns (Light and Heavy), Searchlights and Balloons or Kites.I accompanied Colonel Jones, who was in command of the Army on the islands (in the absence on leave of Brigadier Kemp), on an inspection of the coastal Battery at Hoy Sound, of gun and searchlight positions, of the billetsof two separate detachments of Gordon Highlanders, and of some E.A.S.C.hutments all on the Mainland.(a) At present, 8 Heavy A A. Guns (4-5-inch) (I visited the Caithnesssection of 4 guns on Ore Hill above Lyness), two Bofors and a few pompoms arein position, but other guns were said to be in a ship lying in the Flow, and by theend of the present month or the middle of February 88 guns with their crews andan appropriate number of searchlights should be in positions.(b) The only contract work being done for the Army is on the coastal batteryat Hoy Sound. For the rest the Army are erecting their own huts and bringingtheir men over in parties of about 80 (limited by the capacity of the St. Ola,which they share with the Navy).Naval Officers expressed to me admiration for the work and methodicalprogress of the Army reconnaissance parties^ like the seed sown in the ground,then Field Coys. E.E., the R.A.S.C., R.A.6.C. and gunners with a certainnumber of infantry in small, carefully proportioned, parties, gradually spreadingover the islands and building themselves in and, last of all, the guns!(c) A good deal of scepticism, which I felt bound to share, exists among bothNaval and Military Officers about the use of balloons in the Islands on accountof the high winds which prevail there. Some balloons have arrived, but it isfeared that they will not be much use till the summer, and it is hoped that aserviceable kind of kite may be evolved.5. Land Defences.The Military Authorities seem to be satisfied that the forces at their disposal to deal with parachute descents and the protection of vulnerable points are adequate; but I did not investigate this problem because my time was limited and the risk seems remote. Islands look very small marks to drop on to with a parachute even from three thousand feet. I shouldn&apos;t like to try it (wxcept perhaps on the Mainland or Hoy), even if there was no wind and if there weren&apos;t88 guns 4- the guns of the Fleet shooting at me all the time I was comingdown!6. Command.(a) I was rather surprised to find that the Admiral was not in completeadministrative as well as operational control of the defences of Scapa Flowwith power to determine priorities over the whole range of sea, air and landproblems. I cannot pretend to be convinced that this would not be the bestarrangement.Nevertheless, I was left in not the slightest doubt either by the Naval orthe Military Authorities that the understanding and co-operation between them is complete. In particular, when I visited the headquarters of the Army I askedColonel Jones (who was commanding in the Brigadier&apos;s absence on leave) and major Tuck (the Chief of the Operations Staff) who would be in command ofthe guns and searchlights in the event of an attack on Scapa Flow, and bothanswered without hesitation or qualification that they would be taking their orders from Admiral Binney.(b) I also considered whether this problem would not be simplified andwhether it would not make for economy of force if the A A. defences were taken over by the Boyal Marines.Were the A.A. guns and searchlights being manned on a scale appropriate to the defence of a city or fortified line resolutely held and subject to prolonged and continuous attack % Was the scale too extravagant for such occasional attacksas the Fleet might 1&apos;easonably accept as a normal hazard of war? Presumablyif the attacks on Scapa Flow were prolonged and continuous the Fleet would leave the Flow and go elsewhere and the A A. defences would lose the reasonfor their existence&apos;?
I discovered, however, that the only guns that are manned with 100 percent, reliefs on the basis that the whole guns&apos; crews must be ready to go into action at a moment&apos;s notice, night or day, are the coastal defence batteriescommanding the main entrances to the Flow. They would have to be manned onthe same scale if they were taken over by Marines. Even the coastal batterycommanding Hoy Sound is only manned on the basis of 50 per cent, reliefs.The Searchlight Companies have 33$ per cent, reliefs and the Heavy A.A.Batteries only 25 per cent, reliefs.Indeed, when I was talking to Major Baird I asked him whether the menof the Caithness Section of 4-5-inch on Ore Hill used the canteen at Lyness not much more than half a mile away and he said yes, but that he could onlyspare 5 or 6 men at a time.Moreover, the service of these High-Angle guns in action is exhausting.Captain Oliver mentioned to me that the A.A. gun crews in the Southamptonwere &apos;&apos; all in &apos;&apos; after their recent action against German aeroplanes in the north sea. Some casualties must be anticipated. Men must be available for necessaryfatigues and a certain amount of sickness is unavoidable (although the sicknessrate is exceptionally low in the island). Altogether 25 per cent, of the guns&apos; crewdoes not seem to be an extravagant allowance for relief, and it would seemdoubtful whether Marines would be content, or would be able, to do the job on a substantially smaller establishment.Nor do the Navy possess the Marines that are trained to the job. Time wouldbo lost training them. Who would supply the services now given to the A.-A.Batteries, the Coastal Batteries and the Searchlight companies by the R.A.S.C.and R.A.Q.C. 1 These services are exceptionally difficult and complicated in theOrkney Islands on account of the large number of very small detachmentsbelonging to different units scattered over so many islands.Again, these land A.A. defences are growing methodically under the impulseof the Army Command. I cannot help thinking that it would be dangerous to interrupt that growth and to break the rhythm of its process of expansion, whichthe Navy greatly admire and would find it hard to imitate.Not many of the officers know that this change-over is under consideration;but, one or two senior officers returning from leave have got wind of it, and, ifthe knowledge spreads, there is an obvious risk that it might take the edge offthe keenness with which the Army are working. If a definite decision were madenow to let the Army finish its work on the A A. defence system, it would be possibleto consider say in April or May whether or not it would be advisable to makethe change at the end. of the year, at a time when it would be least likely tointerruption from German air attacks. To make the change-over now would beto risk arresting the growth of the plant and causing serious delay. To make itin the summer would be to risk being caught by the Germans in the process of changing over.7. Conditions of the Men.I bad heard very bad accounts of the conditions on the islands, and was prepared for worse than I found.   The main problems are :  (a) Mud. Which means drainage which leads back to the problems oflabour and piers which I have mentioned already. Meanwhile, thesea of mud in which the men live and which must often be worse thanon the frosty day on which I saw it is very depressing.(b) Water. This is a difficult problem, and, although progress is being made,in   hand,   everybody is apprehensive about the summer. : There is a diminutiveawmtefare bein^^mifde   &quot; catchment&quot; on Flotta, like the big ones at Gibraltar, and I cannotThisTemporaryIntil the full scheme isoperation. Ahelp wondering whether that principle might not be more boldlyapplied.Boredom. The E.N.S.A. concert parties are reported to be good -by those who can reach them. Canteens are being erected wherever possible. But you may remember the big shed which was going tobe used as a cinema at Lyness when we were there in September ? Iwas sorry to hear that the project had been dropped after theIron Duke was beached. It is most necessary to cater for the labourersas well as for the sailors and soldiers. Outdoor recreation is at a discount now when the days are short and there is so much work to
wehTO-.vls&quot;bcK abioa&quot;do ^ done; but probably it would be a good plan to acquire and roughlyuse the&apos; Welling0ma- to prepare recreation grounds before the summer comes.

At Fiotta defences must have priority. But boredom is the most certain, andthe &quot;dining hail  and perhaps the worst, danger to which the morale of the sailors andcanteen should be ready   1  n n.  x n ! .0 i . /-v 1in   March   and   the soldiers and workmen is exposed in the Orkneys.cinema in April.-a. h. Meanwhile, sailors and soldiers (I did not see many workmen) areextraordinarily cheerful in bad conditions and I have no doubt thattheir cheerfulness is largely due to the strenuous efforts which they see are being made to improve things.8. Kirktvall.This is perhaps outside my &quot; terms of reference,&quot; but the spectacle of18 or 20 neutral ships lying in the bay did make me wonder how long it wouldbe before an attack is made on them; and the Germans would make the gibethat we force neutral shipping to come into our harbours and don&apos;t take anytrouble to protect them.The Admiral was kind enough to explain the plans to me, and, of course,Scapa Flow must have precedence. Meanwhile, it may be hoped that sufficientpatrol ships will be provided to reduce the risk of submarine attack to a minimum.Incidentally, the point which I mentioned earlier about the efficacy of 12-pounderguns against submarines applies equally to the plans for the defence of Kirkwall.9. Personal.It is impossible for me to be sufficiently grateful for the extreme kindnessand considerateness which I met from Admiral Binney, Admiral Lyster. AdmiralRaikes Colonel Jones, Commander Graham (Ffatston), and Group-CaptainDigb) Johnston (Wick). Admiral Binney entertained me most hospitably atRisa and Admiral Lyster spent the best part of Tuesday with me and gaveme a real insight into the problems of the defence of Scapa Flow. It was an interesting and memorable experience for which I am very grateful.To sum up, it seems reasonable to hope that by the middle of March the defences of Scapa Flow against submarine and air attack will be substantiallycomplete, although experience and developments in the German air force maywell make it necessary to increase the number of fighter squadrons now contemplated.(Signed) ARCHIBALD SINCLAIR,January 4, 1940.
Enclosure B.The following notes on Sir Archibald Sinclair&apos;b report have been prepared by the naval staff :-Paragraph 2 (v). The li-pdr. guns being mounted in the Eastern entrances are primarilyintended for anti-M.T.B. defence as the blocking and patrols, when the former is completed,should make these Sounds virtually proof against normal types of submarines. Midgetsubmarines, if developed, are likely to be more lightly built.   (See also remarks on paragraph 8.)Paragraph 2 (v) (c). Harbour Defence Patrol Craft have been given instructions thatdepth charges should not be set to less than 100 feet, and. with the craft going 8 knots theyshould be safe. In order to dispel any nervousness, trials are being arranged the results ofwhich will be promulgated.Paragraph 2 (v) (e). Attach by M.T.B&apos;s has not up to the present time been includedin the scale of attack. Now that the Germans are building more of them, this form of attack,though improbable owing to distance, is being allowed for in planning the defences.Paragraph 2 (v) (/) (hi). 1st March, 1940, is now the date by which it is anticipatedthat the defences will be sufficiently advanced for the Fleet to return.Paragraph 3. The Air Staff consider that ITatston is unsuitable for Hurricane and SpitfireFighters, because the runways are too narrow for landing these types of aircraft which havepoor landing views, and there are no taxi tracks and perimeter track at present. When theground has been levelled and the grass has grown, which ie estimated to take about six months,the aerodrome will be suitable for modern fighters.The Air Staff have agreed that three squadrons of Hurricane fighters will be stationed at Wick by the 14th February provided that the surface has been sufficiently improved by then to allow them to operate.Paragraph 4. If the weather allows, about 88 heavy A.A. guns may be in action by mid-March, but gales make the landing of guns impossible and may hold up the programme.Balloons will commence to arrive early in February and 16 should be flying by the 14th February.Investigations are being made by the Air Ministry on the designs of kites and probably - 8will be ready for flying by the 1st March.Paragraph 6 (a). Command has been fully considered by the Admiralty. War Office andAir Ministry, and the solution of &quot;Local Operation Control&quot; rather than Supreme Commandwas evolved. This has been agreed to by Admiral Binney, and appears from the report tobe working satisfactorily.Paragraph G (b). Manning A/A defences is now not to be taken over by the royal marines as previously proposed, owing to the dislocation which would ensue. The Army view which is corroborated in the report is that no appreciable reduction of establishment wouldbe practicable. There would seem to be little point in the Marines taking over the defencesat a later date when the Army are really well established.Paragraph 7 (c). Recreation was investigated during a visit to Scapa by D.D.P.S. (T.E.)in October. It is understood that approval was given to use the P.V. shed for a cinemaand that 800 seats and a supply of films were sent up, but that an alternative scheme hasbeen under consideration locally. Playing grounds are approved but must take second place,to the erection of living accommodation.Paragraph 8. Seaward, and Coast Defences have been approved in &quot; B. Plan&quot; andwill be installed after those of Scapa. It was originally considered unnecessary to defend the Northern approaches to Kirkwall. owing to the navigational difficulties which a submarinewould have to face in order merely to sink a neutral merchant ship. It was on the recommen-dation of the local authorities that 12-pdrs. and, later. Indicator loops were decided upon.These guns should be effective in damaging or forcing down a submarine attempting thepassage on the surface, and will bring patrol craft rapidly to the spot. A.A. guns to cover the anchorage have also been proposed but arrangements are being made to redeplov eight of the guns now allocated so as to provide cover for Kirkwall, in addition to the Northernapproaches to the Flow.
