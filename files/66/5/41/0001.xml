TO BE KEPT UNDER LOOK AMD KEY.II Si requested that special care may be taken toensure the sesreoy of this documentMOST SECRET./2Ma a o a copy no war CABINET.ACTION IN NORWEGIAN TERRITORIAL &apos;WATERS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate for consideration a first draft ofa statement by His Majesty&apos;s Government, in the eventof the Cabinet deciding to take action in the sense proposed by the First Lord of the Admiralty.A great many considerations are involved whichthe Cabinet will wish to review, but they will do soperhaps more easily if they have before them a sketchof the best case that it appears possible to make onbehalf of the action proposed.     The draft has beenprepared with the help of the Attorney-General injoint consultation between the Admiralty and theForeign Office.H.FOREIGN OFFICE.22nd February, 1940,

The recent incident in connexion with the &quot;Altmark&quot;has led His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom notonly to consider that incident in all its bearings butalso to review the position arising from the methodsemployed by the German Government in the conduct of thewar at sea.It is evident from the case of the &quot;Altmark&quot; thatGermany is claiming the right for her warships to utiliselong stretches of neutral waters as a protected means of access to or from the areas in which they carry out theirdepredations.     The use in this way of neutral waters which do not form a normal route for shipping, with the soleobject of avoiding attack by the Allied Fleets, cannot beregarded as an exercise of the right of &quot;innocent passage&quot;which is recognised by international law.His Majesty&apos;s Government could not acquiesce in such anextension of the doctrine of &quot;innocent passage&quot;, which seems to them in contradiction both of the spirit of the relevant international provisions and also of the plainequities involved.     There would for instance be nothing to prevent German ships which are using such a protectedcorridor from making a short raid into the high seas to capture or sink a British merchant ship, returning thereafter to the shelter of territorial waters, or from using thiscovered approach to the open seas, in order to pursue theirdepredations upon shipping, Allied and neutral alike.Nor

Nor again, should it he the policy of the GermanGovernment to support the Soviet Government in the prosecution of their aggression against Finland by sending to Murmansk unlimited supplies of warmaterial, would there be anything to prevent such supplies being carried without   interference through this protected corridor.Such a position would appear to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto be frankly intolerable, and they cannot believe that either the provisions of international law or any reasonableview of the issues involved would impose upon them the dutyof its acceptance.     Moreover, German insistence on theinviolability of neutral waters only applies when this isin their own interests, as is shown by the fact that they havenot hesitated to destroy both British and neutral shipping in those waters.His Majesty&apos;s Government have felt bound to considerthe position not only from the point of view of what hasbeen said above but also in the light of the general conductby the enemy of warfare on the high seas.In

2ey (yhi ft)3 oIn recent weeks the German campaign against the merchantshipping of all nations has been intensified and pursuedwith even greater brutality than before.     The number of neutral ships destroyed by German action is now nearly 150,and the number of neutral lives lost is over 1,000.     The;.:eattacks have been carrie . out in almost every case in defiance of the recognised rules of war, frequently in circumstancesof the greatest barbarity, and on many occasions withoutthere being the slightest justification for interferencewith the ship.     Germany has announced that she regards her-self as entitled to destroy any neutral ship en route   to any british port,, including contraband control harbours, andthere have, moreover, been a number of cases of vessels being destroyed on voyages between two neutral ports, when the vessel had no intention of touching at a British port at all.It is obvious that the German Government have now embarked onan indiscriminate campaign of destruction throughout the watersin which their unnotified mines are laid or their submarines in a position to operate.While in recent weeks the greatest losses have fallenupon neutral shipping, British and Allied vessels have also suffered from the adoption of this policy of destruction;a new development of which is the bombing from the air ofBritish trawlers and fishing boats and the machine-gunningof their crews.The innocent character of fishing boats has been recognised by the provision in Article 5 of The Hague Convention No. XI,which/

which exempts vessels employed exclusively in coast fisheriesfrom capture, but the fact that Germany is a party to thisprovision has not prevented her from committing nearly 200attacks on such vessels, aimed at sinking them and murderingtheir crews, -   Even lightships, the object of which is toprotect, shipping of all nations and which are by internationalusage treated as non-combatants, have been with their crewsruthlessly attacked by bombs.Our enemies are thus seeking by illegal methods, includingthe murder of neutral seamen, to prevent any ships reaching the Allied countries and to deter neutral seamen by fear of death from engaging in lawful trade with. them.Faced with an enemy who disregards all the rules whichat any time, it suits him to break, His Majesty&apos;s government cannot reasonably be held bound to the strict observance whichthe enemy desires of a particular rule affecting the inviolabilityof enemy warships and trade in neutral territorial waters.The letter of the lav/ must not in supreme emergency obstructthose who are charged with its protection and enforcement.It would not be right or rational that the Aggressor Power shouldgain one set of advantages by tearing up all laws, and anotherset by sheltering behind the innate respect for law of their opponents.His Majesty?s Government in the United Kingdom accordinglygive notice that they will henceforth hold themselves free totake such action as they may deem appropriate to check thecontinued use by the enemy of territorial waters which are clearly of particular value to him.     In so far as such action may take the form of mine-laying, such mines will be notifiedin accordance with The Hague Convention.
