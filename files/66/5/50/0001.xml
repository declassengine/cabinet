It would be necessary for us, if we were tohave any chance of inducing the Swedes to allowour troops to enter Scandinavia, to be able to reassure them as to the extent of the support which we could give them.     This could only bedone if we were able to hold Staff conversations with them.&quot;2. We have been examining the problem of Staff conversations with the Scandinavian countries, so as to be in a position toact when the time comes.     In so doing, it has become clear to us that consultations with the Norwegian and swedish governments will be required on a much broader basis than thatgenerally understood by the term. &quot;Staff Conversations&quot;.     Assoon as Marshal Mannerheim makes his appeal, which he has beenasked to do on 5th March, we shall be making a politicalapproach to Norway and Sweden.     If the Governments of thosecountries feel any inclination to respond to our representations, we imagine that they will very quickly reach the stage- of asking for full information about our plans,and of inquiring how we propose to assist them to overcome thedifficulties and dangers with which they will be confronted.Their questions will embrace not only military, but economicand financial matters, and we could hardly expect His Majesty&apos;s* Representatives in Oslo and Stockholm to be able to give the answers without the support of experts in the various fields,who are fully acauainted with the whole subject, and havereceived precise instructions from His majesty is&apos;Government.We have been able to consult with representativesof the Foreign Office, the Treasury, and theMinistry of Economic Warfare.    Though the problems are by nomeans entirely military as they have cone to light as the resultof our study, we venture to call the attention of the Wara W.M.(40) 45rd Conclusions, Minute 1.

Gabinet to then and to make recommendations: -Military Questions.3. The War Cabinet are fully aware of the military aspect of the problem, and we do not propose to saymore about   it   in this Report.Economic Matters.4. (a) Food.     We are informed that the greater partof the food-producing area of Sweden lies South ofthe line of the lakes, and would therefore be over-runat an early stage in a German invasion.     Although theNorthern area is to a large extent self-supporting,there might well be a large influx of populationfleeing from the South, and considerable quantities offood would have to be imported through the Norwegianports to. feed the refugees, and also the Swedish armed forces.(b) Coal.      Imports of coal and coke are about million tons per annum in peace.     Most of this isrequired for the industries in the South, but about one million tons per annum vrould be required for theNorth.(c) Armaments and Manufackured Goods.      once the Southern part of the country was over-run. Swedenwould be unable to supply any armaments.      All buta small proportion of the manufactured goods requiredfor the civil population of the North would also haveto be imported.(d) Ore.     Since a large number of the inhabitants of Northern Sweden depend for their living on the exportof iron ore, we should have to put forward proposals for taking that part of the ore which would otherivise have gone to Germany.      This will depend largely on the amountof shipping available, but it is a problem to which wemust be able to propose a definite solution.5. It is clear that the economic problem presented to Sweden,  if she becomes involved in the war,  shouldbe fully studied by the Departments concerned over here, so that, if discussions start with the Swedes,we shall be able to put forward concrete px^oposalsfor meeting them.Financial Matters.6. Experience in recent years has shown that thebeginning of political and military conversations isthe signal for the making of formidable financialdemands on this country.      We should be prepared to say

(owhat assistance we could give to Norway and Sweden.Proposal for a Delegation.7- The above are some of the questions which are bound to arise as scon as the Norwegian and swedish governments start discussions as the result of theFinnish appeal.      We suggest that a Delegation shouldbe prepared, which could leave immediately forScandinavia when the  time comes, and we make thefollowing tentative proposals for the status,composition, end preparation of this Delegation:-Composition of the Delegation.8. The Delegation, as we have pointed out, wouldhave to deal with a wide variety of subjects in an authoritative manner.      It would be undesirable for itto be too large., and It will not be possible for itto contain experts on every matter which might betouched on in the -talks,     We suggest that what Isrequired is a small Delegation headed by a Minister, andcomposed of members of sufficient status to deal withthe broad issues .      It should include  Naval.,&apos; Military andAir Force representatives.    as explained below, the workof the delegation would be followed up by more detailedconsultations between experts in the various fields.Preparation of the Delegation.9. We have suggested that there should be a ministerial Head to the Delegation, and one of the main reasons we think this important is because of the work required to be done,before the Delegation leavesEngland,in the way of preparation .      A number ofdifferent   Departments   are involved, particularly in-the economic field, and a Minister charged with the specific duty of co-ordinating the work of preparationwould be in a position to ensure the co-operation of allconcerned,     We would point out that time is short.The Finns are due to make their appeal on 5th March, andthe Delegation might be required to leave for Scandinaviaalmost immediately after that.      We suggest, therefore,that its members should be appointed and set to work as soon as possible,  so that they may become fullyacquainted with the task confronting them, and&apos; cancollect all the information which they will require.Staff Cpiny er sa tions,10.        If it be assumed that events go according to plan, and the Delegation is successful in conversations with the Norwegians and the Swedes, and next step wouldbe to send out to Scandinavia Staff Officers, both military and economic, to work out the details of our

911e:NOassistance to Norway and Sweden, and to co-coordinate the military plan.      The final stage would be reachedwhen our troops had begun to land, by which tine it wouldbe desirable for a Military Mission to be constituted in Scandinavia   for liaison with the Military Commandersof those countries.,Method of Dealing with the separate Governments of norway and Sweden.11.        One of the main difficulties to be overcome incarrying out Conversations with the Scandinavian countries,is that it will presumably be necessary to deal with both   Norway and Sweden separately.     We think it would be most   undesirable to constitute two Delegations, or even tohave one Delegation capable of splitting into two.      under such an arrangement it would be difficult to ensure thatour policy was being iriterprotec consistently in the- twocapitals.     We suggest that, if possible^;when ourdiplomatic approach is made to the two Governments, thesuggestion should also be put forward that discussions should bake place in Stockholm, and that the Norwegiansshould appoint a plenipotentiary to take part in them.By this means, progress should be more rapid, andco-ordination should, be achieved.Summary of Conclusions.12.        To sum up, we recommend:-   ,(a) That a Delegation, preferably with a Ministerat its heed, should be set up forthwith, so asto be ready to go at once to Scandinavia for discussions with Norway and Sweden resultingfrom the Finnish appeal.(b) That the Delegation should include military andeconomic representatives, but that its exact,composition should be settled by the Head ofthe Delegation, after consultations with theappropriate Departments.(,c) That the Departments concerned should make readyexpert Staff Officers -to go to Scandinavia,whensummoned by the Delegation, to continuedetailed conversations, and to co-ordinate plans.(d) That,  if possible, arrangements should- be madefor discussions to take place in Stockholm,and for the Norwegian Government to send a delegation to takeirt in them,Richmond Terra;(Signed)V/, lo24-th February, 1940.-4-Rc E.
