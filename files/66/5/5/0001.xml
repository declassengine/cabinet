THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-  -TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE NARVIK QUESTION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE, for further consideration by my colleagues, the draft ofa telegram which it is proposed to submit to The King as an answer to the king of Norway&apos;s recent telegram about the stopping of the iron ore traffic from narvik to Germany, which was discussed at this morning&apos;s Cabinet.Foreign Office, January 16, 1940.Draft telegram from The King to the King of Norway.I HAVE been giving the most careful consideration to Your Majesty&apos;telegram of the , and my Ministers have been examining thewhole situation.Let me hasten to assure Your Majesty that my Government do not fail torealise the difficulty in which your Government might be placed by the actionof my Government on the lines communicated by them to Your Majesty&apos;s minister in London.I am sure Your Majesty understands no less how intolerable is the positionarising out of repeated breaches by the unscrupulous enemy of the InternationalCode, with every accompanying circumstance of inhumanity.Before, however, taking action, as in this situation they felt fully entitledto do, my Government decided that it would be right to consult with your Govern-ment, with whom they have enjoyed, and hope to continue to enjoy, the friendliestrelations. They feel that the issues arising are of such importance to both ourGovernments that it is essential to seek every opportunity of a full and frankdiscussion in all its aspects.It seems to them that the best way of securing this result would be, if thiscourse met with Your Majesty&apos;s approval, that they should depute a Minister,fully authorised to speak on all the questions involved, to visit your Capital and discuss matters direct with your Government. If so, it could be arranged thatsuch a representative should leave at short notice.Since this question is evidently of interest also to Sweden, I should proposeto ask the King of Sweden if the Minister might thereafter go on a similar mission to Stockholm.If this is agreed, Your Majesty&apos;s Government might think it well, when theMission comes to be announced, to indicate that its purpose would be the discussionof trade and other cognate questions at present of interest to our two Governments.Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1940.W.P. (40) 25.SECRET.H.10828   [20643]
