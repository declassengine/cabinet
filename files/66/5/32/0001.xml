Printed for the War Cabinet.  February 1940.SECRET.Copy No./W.P. (40) 52.TO BE kept under LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SCAPA FLOW.Note by First Lord of the Admiralty.1 CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues some notes preparedby the Civil Lord after a recent visit to Scapa.I VISITED Scapa Flow last week in order to discuss on the spot the various sections of the Defence Plan with the responsible Officers and to see for myselfwhat progress was being made.2. The plans on which we are working comprise a complete scheme ofDefence designed to render the Fleet at anchor in Scapa Flow sate from both sea and air attack.3. The defence from sea attack consists of Blockships, Booms, ControlledMinefields, Indicator Loops and Harbour Defence Asdics. These formidabledeterrents are further reinforced by Boom Patrol Craft and guns sited to coverBooms and Blocked Channels.4. Against attack from the air, 88 heavy A.A. guns, 40 light A.A. guns and108 searchlights will be manned by the Army. A Balloon Barrage will be in position. Squadrons of fighter aircraft will be in readiness at Hatston andSkea Brae in the Orkneys, and at Wick on the mainland.5. Every effort has been made to have these defences in a sufficient state of readiness to allow the Fleet to return by March 1.6. Unfortunately, a series of severe storms have caused damage and delay and for days IIO IIIOvcii1c 1.1t Vva s possible by sea. The weather, however, has nowimproved.7. By March 1 it is expected that three Booms will be complete with singlenets, that three out of the four controlled minefields will be laid, and that two indicator loops will be in position. The majority of the blockships shouldbe in place, though we have lost three in transit and one has been torn from its position by the storm.The runways at Hatston Aerodrome are finished and new fighter squadronshave arrived.W.

8. One of the biggest problems has been to provide hutting for the personnelspread all round the Flow. This has been solved by giving the contract for thewhole scheme to a single contractor. At first, in order to house his workmen,trailer caravans and garden huts were sent up; now, the camps for the manyhundred Naval and Civilian personnel are in rapid course of erection, as wellas the detached huts for watchkeepers on the various defences.A dining hall, canteen and cinema are being built on Flotta, and a Cinemafor the Base at Lyness.9. Piers, cranes, water-supplies, stores, electricity and transport have all had to be provided.10. I found a wonderful spirit of cheerfulness and determination, in spiteof the discouraging conditions, among both the Service and Civilian personnel,and I am quite certain,that it will not be from lack of energy on their part thatthe Fleet is kept away from Scapa Flow for one day longer than is necessary.A. H., Civil Lord.
