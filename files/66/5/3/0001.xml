COPY NO-  M ifi WAR CABINET,SOANDINAVIiV:.....PLAN AND PREPARATIONS.Report &quot;by Chiefs of    Staff^Cormnittee^^On the 10th January2&apos; the War    Cabinet invited us toadvise them as jo. the instructions and authority which theService   Departments required to enable detailed plans and preparations to he made for the operations descrihed inour report of the 31st December (y.P,  (39) 179, paragraph102 ( iii) and. ( vi)),    vis: -(a) The despatch of a force via Narvik to theNorthern Swedish ore fields,,(b) The despatch of a force to co-operate in thedefence of   Southern Sweden.,2c In addition to dealing with the above operations inour Report of the 31st   December we would remind the WarCabinet that we referred in paragraphs 81-84 and 102 (vii)to the importance of occupying the ports of Bergen,    Trondheimand Stavanger, and in paragraph 102 (viii) we stated:-&quot;It is thus clear that the three operations inNorthern Scandinavia,.    Southern Norway and southern Sweden are complementary, and it is vital to the success of the project that weshould he prepared to carry out all threeconcurrently,, ;we have,  therefore, felt it right to link, up the operationof occupying the three ports in Southern Norway with theoperations referred to us by the   War Cabinet as set outin paragraph 1 above,3. The present position is that,  in view of the War cabinet decision (w.Mo(40) 10th Conclusions)  &quot;that no action should be taken  for the time being to stop the traffic between Germany andNarvik&quot;, normal dispositions have been resumed by the naval forceearmarked for operations in Norwegian territorial waters and thetroops, which were held in readiness to proceed to the threeports in Southern Norway, have been &quot;stood down&quot; and the transports released.    In fact all preparations for immediateoperations in Scandinavia are,  for the moment-  in abeyance.21 Wo Mo   (40) 8th Conclusions, Minute lc

4, In the following paragraphs wc sot out seriatimthe instructions and authority which, as far as we can see at present, will &quot;be required to put into effect thethree projects referred to above.Despatch of a Force via Narvik to the IT or thorn SwedishOre Fields.5o Planning in respect of this project is suffiently advanced to enable us to seek authority for the following:-(a) The preparation of an initial force ofapproximately two Brigades, speciallyequipped, together with certain ancillaryunits,  to be ready to sail for Scandinaviaby the end of FebruarycWe are informed that General Gamelin has agreed to provide one Brigade ofIj Chasseurs Alpinso      Three regularf British battalions could be provided tomake up the balance of the infantryrequired at the outset:. We would observe,however, that this force may have to be substantially increased - possibly up to two divisions - at a later date.-.(b) The allocation of one existing fighter squadron from the air defence of GreatBritain,  and the formation of one newarmy co-operation flight, for the air support of this forceoThe provision of certain base and line ofcommunication units.    These must be specially raised, since units of the righttype are not at present available^    Thenumbers will not be great, and, if authority is given at once, they can be ready by thetime they will be required^(d) The taking up and fitting out, as soon as necessary, of the shipping required for the expedition.      The ships used for the trans-portatipn and maintenance of the british expeditionary Force to France will not be suitable owing to the length of the voyageand the adverse weather conditions whichmust be anticipated^(e) The purchase of specialised stores and clothingfor Arctic conditions..    The details of these have not yet been determined, but it isestimated, that an expenditure of  50,000\\  will cover requirements,,(f) The formation of one or two specialist units(eag. for the construction of wooden huts).For this purpose it is proposed to enlistNewfoundland loggers - now in the UnitedKingdom, engaged on forestry work.(c)

The Occupation of the three Ports in Southern   Norway.6. Simultaneously with the above expedition? or evenpossibly in advance of it, we should occupy Stavanger,Bergen and Trondheim.     The War Cabinet will recall that on the 3rd January (W.H.   (40) 2nd Conclusions, minute (vi)) they authorised the War Office &quot;to make purchases of the special clothing etc. required for the small force which it was contemplated would be necessary forthe vital occupation of these ports&quot;, and that subsequentlya Memorandum   by the War Office showing the full implications-tions of this project was placed before them (W.P.   (40)13).     This Paper was not discussed by the War Cabinetin view of the decision (W.M.  (40) 10th Conclusions,Minute 1) &quot;that no action should be taken for the timebeing to stop the traffic between Germany and Narvik&quot;;and, as stated in paragraph 3 above, all preparations forimmediate operations in Scandinavia are for the moment in abeyance.7. Accordingly we now ask for authority to make de-tailed plans and preparations for the despatch, at theappropriate moment, to the ports in Southern Norway ofthe following force -Force Headquarters and Signals5 Infantry battalions  Field Company, R.E.Ancillary Personnel.The total strength of the above force is some3,500 of whom 3,200 are infantry.The Despatch of a force to co-operate in the defence ofSouthern Sweden.8. We pointed out In our previous report that we mightN-.have to send substantial land and air forces to southern sweden as part of the price of obtaining Swedish co-operation.     An examination of this operation is in hand,,but the stage has not yet been reached when the detailsof the forces required and the preparations to beauthorised can be stated with precision.     We can say now,however, that, if assistance to the Swedes is to be madeavailable in the S.pring, the following are some of themeasures that will be necessary:-(a)    The 44th and 42nd Divisions,  (ill Corps) shouldbe retained in England.     The latest date by which a decision must be taken is 2ndFebruary.     Any further Divisions andCorps troops which may be found necessaryafter detailed examination must be providedeither from the British Expeditionary Forceitself, or from formations destined to join the British Expeditionary Force.

(b) We should, have immediate authority to raisenow the necessary base and line ofcommunication units required to establish a major line of communication,,      these units cannot be taken from France,,(c) As regards air assistance lack of informationprevents our making definite recommendations as to the air forces to be despatched.As a basis for planning we propose toearmark a force of two fighter squadronsttwo bomber squadrons and one army co-operation Squadron for operations inSwed.en0     These would have to be withdrawnfrom Great Britain0      In addition it isintended that supplies should be laid downin Sweden for an advanced base for fourheavy bomber squadrons which would operate in or from the United KingdomQ      Lackof suitable aerodromes and facilities islikely however to prevent us providing eventhe above scale of air assistance^.9* Fx^om the above it will be clear that land and airassistance to the Swedes can only be provided at the expenseof home and France in. one form or anothere10a       We propose to submit a further report as soon aspossible dealing more fully with this project and itsimplicationsoSxx^aryvlla       To sum up3 we seek authority for the following:-The Northern Sweden Fjorceo(a) The preparation of an initial force ofappro-^i^tely two Brigades, specially eqxtipped,together with certain ancillary unitsa to beready to sail by the end of February,,    Of this force we understand that the French are preparedto provide one Brigade of Chasseurs Alpinso(b) The allocation of one fighter squadron from theair defence of Great Britain and the formationof one new army co-operation ilighto(o)    The provision   of ^ex*tain base and line ofcommunicpti on units which will hsye to be speciallyraisedo(d) To take up and fit outc, as soon as necessax^y, theshipping required for the expedition,,(e) The purchase of specialised stores and clothingfor Arctic conditions at an estimated expenditureof  50a000c(f) The enlistment of Newfoundland loggers forconstxmction work0The Occupation of Three Ports in Southern Norway0(g) To make detailed plans and preparations fox&quot;- the
