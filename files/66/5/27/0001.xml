(39) 150 I circulate to my colleagues, for their approval, a report by the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee of the Chiefs ofStaff Committee on the organisation of an intelligence system in certain countries of the Middle East. The proposals have been approved by the service departments and the India Office.H.Foreign Office. February 9, 1940.J.I.C. SUB-COMMITTEE REPORT.THE terms of reference of the present Sub-Committee are to make, inaccordance with the decision reached by the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee attheir meeting of the 15th December, detailed recommendations for the organisation of an effective intelligence system in certain countries of the Middle East,as set out in the memorandum on the Soviet threat to British interests in theMiddle East, circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs on the 6th December (W.P. (39) 150).The objects to be achieved are : (i) to collect from all sources information about Soviet activities in thecountries of the Middle East,(ii) to obtain information from the Soviet Union in general and inparticular from Soviet Central Asia and Transcaucasia, with special reference to subversive elements inside the Soviet Union, with a viewto their eventual use for action against the Soviet regime,(iii) to strengthen the national resistance of the countries of the Middle east to Soviet penetration or invasion.It is recommended that, for the purpose of achieving these objects, use shouldbe made of existing organisations, which could, where necessary, be expanded oradapted.As regards intelligence, in so far as a delimitation of spheres is feasible, itis suggested that the region west of the line running north and south throughTehran, viz., Transcaucasia, Iraq and Western Iran, should be the concern of the10871   [20794]
General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Middle East, and that the area east ofthis line, viz., Afghanistan, Eastern&apos; Iran, Soviet Centra] Asia and Sinkiang,should be the concern of the competent authorities of the Government of India.In order to ensure that adequate attention is paid to Soviet affairs, both these authorities should be asked to consider the inclusion in their staffs ofofficers with a specialised knowledge of Soviet affairs, and, if possible, first-handexperience of the regions with which they are dealing.Propaganda of all kinds dealing with the Soviet Union will,&apos;11 throughoutthe area, be the concern of Sir Campbell Stuart, who will make suitable arrange-ments with the other authorities concerned for its dissemination. suitable arrangements will also be made to enable Sir Campbell Stuart to perform this task. These arrangements will include the appointment of a special representative in Cairo who will be given access to all available information regarding Sovietaffairs. Sir Campbell Stuart will discuss with the India Office parallelarrangements to apply to India.January 6, 1940.

(39) 141), instructecl* us, in collaboration with the Minister of Supply,to examine in detail the state of equipment and maintenance of the British Armyin France.2. We have examined in great detail the position as regards requirements and supplies likely to be available in the first year of war in respect of the keyitems of equipment referred to in Paper No. W.P. (39) 141; and we have further considered the extent of the military effort which, so far as equipment may be held to govern the position, is likely to be capable of attainment by the1st September, 1941.3. Assuming as we do that the key items of munitions production referredto are those likely to present the greatest difficulties in supply, we have obtainedfrom the Ministry of Supply estimates of the maximum production which, intheir view, is attainable by the 1st September, 1941. These estimates are givenin Appendix A, and the provisos which govern them in Appendix B.4. For the purpose of these estimates it has been assumed that authority will be given to the Ministry of Supply to provide every factory and all manu-facturing facilities which they can say will be in production by the1st September, 1941.5. The quantities shown are less than those required for sending even the36 Divisions now in existence overseas by the 1st September, 1941, if it had to beassumed : (a) That wastage starts on the 1st March, 1940, and operates continuouslythereafter;(b) That existing standards of equipment are maintained;(c) That existing estimates of wastage are realised; and(d) That full provision is made for training.Some of us feel very strongly, however, that maintenance requirements on presentscales of wastage are, in many cases, far in excess of what can reasonably be* W.M.
