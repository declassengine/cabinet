THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  January 1940.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (40) 36.[Also Paper No. CCS. (40) 220.)TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAP. CABINET.ALLIED ASSISTANCE TO FINLAND.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.WE have, in the course of the last few days, received from the French high command a Paper suggesting a joint study of the question of assistance to finland, with particular reference to the possibility of operations by polish forces in the Petsamo-Murmansk area, a possibility which came under discussion at the War Cabinet on the 24th January. In view of the likelihood of thisquestion being raised at the forthcoming meeting of the Supreme War Council, wehave thought it right to prepare this commentary on the French views.Allied Motives for assisting Finland.2. The French suggest that the Allies have the following motives for assisting Finland : (a) The supply of materials by Russia to Germany will be retarded as long-as the Russo-Finnish war continues.(b) The Soviet threat to the Balkans will diminish if Russia meets withreverses in the north.(c) Allied assistance to Finland would strengthen the Scandinavian countriesvis-d-vis Germany and would give confidence to small neutralPowers.Comment.We agree with (a) and (b) above. As regards (c), we think that such assistance might have effect in course of time, but up to the present by reason oftheir fear of Germany, the Scandinavian States have shown no signs of abandoning their attitude of strict neutrality.Dex-patch of Aircraft to Finland.3. 2Jie French point out that Finland is in urgent need of war material,particularly aircraft. To avoid delay, investigation should be made into thepossibility of flying aircraft to Finland (instead of despatching them in crates).Comment.This fact is already appreciated by the War Cabinet. Aircraft are beingnown from this country to Finland whenever practicable.[20709] B
Attack on Russian Sea Communications between&apos; Murmansk and Petsamo.5. The French suggest that, as the transport of war material to Finlandwill take considerable time, Finland should be helped by direct action now.They do not advocate intervention by French a,nd ourselves, but they suggestthat this should be undertaken by Polish forces. They consider that the onlyform of direct action which Polish forces could undertake in winter would beto attack Russian sea communications between Murmansk and Petsamo. Eventemporary interruption of this sea traffic would mean the failure of the Russianeffort to the south of Petsamo. Such action could be undertaken by Polishwarships.   Later Polish troops might be sent to the Petsamo area..Comment.6. The three Polish destroyers and two submarines now with the royal navy, could be made available to operate against Russian sea communications between Murmansk and Petsamo. As to the effect which might be expected from such action, we have no firm information as to the extent to which the russian military forces in the Petsamo area are now being maintained by sea. Part ofthese forces were sent there by way of Motovski Gulf and were landed in thesouth-west corner of the Ribachi Peninsula, whence they advanced overland ashort distance to Petsamo. This sea route from Murmansk is only about 40 mileslong and is much less vulnerable to naval attack, particularly surface attack,than is the all sea route to Petsamo. To safeguard it, the Russians have declareda dangerous area, some part of which at least is known to be mined. They can also presumably keep this area under air observation by day.7. Even, however, if the Russian military forces in the Petsamo area arebeing maintained by sea, the War Office estimate that only one small shipper week would be required. Moreover, interception is a difficult problem,particularly on the inner route to the Motovski Gulf, which can easily be covered in the dark; and we could not expect to intercept the traffic completely.8. Our information does not confirm the French statement that &quot;eventhe temporary interruption of this sea traffic would mean the failure of theRussian efforts to the south of Petsamo.&quot; (We intend to make enquiries fromthe French as to the information on which this opinion was based.) On theother hand, the mere presence of Polish naval forces in the area might drivethe Russians to make use of the inadequate land communications for fear of attack at sea and thus hamper them considerably, even if our more modestestimate of their requirements proves more correct than the estimate made bythe French Staff. Even if they were only driven to use the inner sea routesomething would be gained.9. The Polish destroyers have a limited endurance, being designed forwork in the Baltic. They cannot steam to Petsamo from a Scottish port andback without refuelling. It would consequently be necessary for them to make use of an advanced fuelling base in Norwegian waters. The Norwegians mightbe prepared to agree to this, or perhaps to wink at it, rather than formallyagree. One of the three Polish destroyers is undergoing a refit at the moment,but all three could be made available at comparatively short notice. Of the submarines, only the Orzel is available, as the Wilk is proceeding to France(where she was built) for a refit and new battery.10. The Russians have some 27 submarines in Northern waters and the threat of these would prevent the Polish destroyers, which are not fitted withasdics, maintaining a standing patrol off the Murmansk area to interruptmovements of supply ships. It would be necessary for them to adopt &quot; tip-and-run &quot; tactics, and to change their fuelling base from time to time, taking suchanti-submarine measures as were possible while fuelling- 11. The maintenance of Polish naval forces from British bases whileattacking Russian communications would, according to international law, be anunneutral act. We understand, however, that the Foreign Office do not considerthat this aspect of the matter need prevent the action under consideration being&apos;taken.
Intervention by Polish Land Forces.12, The French suggest that Polish land forces might later be despatchedand landed in the Petsamo area. The object of such an operation would be notonly to deny Petsamo to the Russians, but to use it ourselves as a base for warshipsto watch the Northern exit of the Russian Arctic Canal.Comment.13. Before dealing specifically with the French suggestion, we wish to offer some observations on the problem of landing a force in the Petsamo-Murmanskarea. The Secretary of State for War has &quot;recently submitted a Report* on thesubject to the Military Co-ordination Committee, of which the following are relevant extracts :  &quot;1. The Russians are now in occupation of Petsamo and have three divisions in the area Murmansk-Petsamo.&quot; 2. The port facilities are poor. So far as is known, only one quay andone warehouse exist.&quot; 3. Entrance is by a fiord with high, rocky sides for the most part.This makes it difficult to bring fire to bear from mobile artillery into thefiord, but it also precludes a landing at any point other than the port withoutdetailed reconnaissance.   There are no fixed defences.&quot; 4. A full-scale combined operation would be required, involving a lineof communication nearly 1,500 miles long. In addition, Murmansk and thenaval base of Polyarnoo are only 100 miles to the East of Petsamo, and it isknown that 4 large and 15 small destroyers. 26 submarines and manyauxiliary vessels were based at these ports before the War. This force maywell have been reinforced.&quot; 5. Communications inland consist of one road southwards to Tornea.Land communications to the East are probably bad since the Russians, muchas they dislike the sea. reinforced Petsamo from Murmarsk by sea duringthe recent operations.&quot;14. The above considerations show that an opposed landing at Petsamo isnot a practical proposition. As to the French suggestion that we should, ourselves,make use of Petsamo, we cannot agree that the port would be of any value to us.If other means of entering Finland are not available, it will certainly not bepossible to sustain her resistance through Petsamo, where the quay facilities and communications are so poor. The only objects of operations in that area,therefore would be (i) To interfere as much as possible with the maintenance of Russian forcesbased on Petsamo.(ii) To prevent the Russians using the port later on as a base for larger-forces.The first object could be achieved to some extent by the use of Polish naval forces as suggested above. The second could be achieved&apos; by destroying the limitedquay and port facilities, which are made of wood. This could be&quot; done by a raid,and a large land force would not be required. A note on the facilities which exist in the Petsamo area, and the best means of raiding them, is annexed.Summary of possibilities of operations by Polish forces in the Petsamo area.15. To sum up, operations by Polish destroyers are practicable so long as.iNorwegian concurrence or connivance at their fuelling in Norwegian waters is forthcoming. Owing to their short endurance, these ships cannot operate direct from British bases.There is no certainty that these destroyers would completely interrupt thesea communications to Petsamo, but their operations would at least be likely to hamper the Russians&apos; communications. Though we can ill spare these vesselsrrom their present duties, we do not consider that this aspect of the matter*  aper No. M.O. (40) 32. This Paper has not yet been taken bv the Military Co-co-ordination committee.[20709] B 2
should prevent their use in the Petsamo area, if the Polish Government wishso to use them. Submarine operations would be practicable, though only onePolish submarine is available at the moment, and their psychological effect wouldbe good even if no great military success was achieved.16. Operations by Polish land forces are not practicable except possiblyas part of a naval raid on the port facilities.Conclusion.17. Our conclusion on the limited question discussed in this Paper is thatit will not be a feasible proposition to sustain Finland through the port ofPetsamo either with Anglo-French or Polish forces on any considerable scaleat this time of year.18. It is clear that the French regard the Finnish situation as serious and are anxious to discuss it at an early meeting of the Supreme War Council.The wider issues of Allied assistance to the Finns, with a view to sustainingFinnish resistance and saving them from collapse, are being considered as amatter of urgency.(Signed) DUDLEY POUND.R.

Petsamo Destruction of Harbour Facilities.THE available intelligence indicates the following facilities in the Gulf ofPetsamo: (a) Linammari. Two small jetties in existence.   In general, the facilities are flimsy and primitive; ships can unload by the fore hatch only. a development scheme is projected, but its progress is not known.(b) Petsamo.^-As far as is known, there are no piers at Petsamo itself.Linammari is the unloading port, and there is a road from here toPetsamo, and hence into the interior. Destruction of this road would cut the communications into the interior.Local Defences.2. The Russians are reported to have mounted coastal guns at the entrance to the Gulf, and to have laid minefields off all the inlets between the Norwegianfrontier and the Ribachi peninsula. The existence of minefields has beensubstantiated by 11 Russian mines having been washed up in the Varanher fiord.Forms of A attack by Naval Forces.3.   The harbour and facilities could be attacked by the following means : (a) Air Bombardment by F.A.A. aircraft from a carrier.(b) Ship bombardment by battleships, cruisers or destroyers.(c) Landing Parties.(d) Close attack by destroyers.(e) Close attack by submarines.Air Bombardment.4. This could, of course, be carried out only by British forces. It should hold good prospects of success, but it would probably be impossible to distinguish between purely civil and military objectives.5. The A.A. defences are probably negligible but there is a Russianaerodrome at Murmansk from which fighters could be operated.6.   A strong A/S and cruiser escort for the carrier would be necessary.Ship Bombardment.7. The targets are considered to be too small and difficult to identify tomake this a profitable form of attack, taking into account the submarine andmine menace and the possibility of counter-bombardment.Landing Parties.8.   These could not-be landed in the face of Russian opposition.Destroyer Raid.9. This is considered to be feasible; close-range gun and torpedo fire woulddispose of ships in the harbour and the quays. The success of this form of attack depends largely on the efficiency of the mine-fields and coastal defencesif, indeed, there are any.SIM Raid.10. This is considered feasible, the principal obstacle being the minefield.A submarine, by gun and torpedo fire, could do considerable damage in a shorttune Air attack on the way out might be expected. There is no intelligenceot the existence of an A/S boom.11. To sum up. If British forces can be used a raid by the FA.A. from aearner is considered to offer the best means of destroying the facilities; if onlyi ohsh forces are used a submarine or destroyer raid might achieve the object.
