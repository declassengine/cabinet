1. South-Eastern Europe.M. DALADIER said that the situation in the Balkans, like that in northern europe, raised issues of policy of the first importance. On the Western Frontthere were two powerful, strongly entrenched armies. The German army wouldnot &quot;perhaps for some time seek to bring matters to a head. It appeared thatthe Germans, realising this fact, had at various times contemplated a movementacross the Low Countries or on other European fronts. That was only to beexpected; there were both military and economic reasons for such an attempt.Germany might wish to escape from a struggle in the West; moreover, therewere rich supplies of minerals in the Northern countries, while in the Balkansshe could find ample supplies of food, oil and other commodities, and thuscounteract the effects of the blockade. IAlthough the political situation had not greatly changed since the date mthe last meeting of the Supreme War Council, the Governments of the balkan countries were at last showing signs of an understanding of the threat ofcollusive action against them by Germany and Russia. A determination to resistattack by Germany, or Russia, or both, was taking shape, and a series ofindications made the present a very opportune moment for considering how best Britain and France might help those countries to defend themselves. Inaddition, the guarantees given to Greece and Roumania bound us in honour toassist those countries if attacked; the Anglo-Franco-Turkish Treaty was a new factor of great importance in the Eastern Mediterranean; finally, the attitudeof the Yugo-Slav Government appeared to have changed and a Yugo-SlavMilitary Mission was now on its way to France.What, in the circumstances, could the Allies do to help? There was nothought in the French Governments mind of sending an Expeditionary force at once to the Balkans; that would be premature and might arouse keen opposition in Italy. All that was proposed was to take advantage of the remaining two orthree months of relative quiet to prepare to help the Balkan countries should they decide to resist any aggression upon them. Such preparation would takethe following forms : (1) Joint diplomatic action in Turkey, Roumania, Greece and Yugo-Slavia;(2) Material help to all countries prepared to resist aggression.(3) A study of the forms in which assistance could best be given to thedifferent countries.(4) An effort to persuade the countries concerned to unite to resist aggression,and no longer to accept the risk of being disposed of singly and in turn.The above measures clearly involved the despatch of as much war materialas could be spared to the countries concerned, as well as active Staff conversations in all four capitals with the object of making technical preparations for allied assistance later.He considered that, if the present opportunity were missed, Germany and russia would be strongly tempted next Spring to move south, towards the ^Egeanand the Straits respectively, and that Italy would then be bound to claim herre of the spoils and move to Corfu, and perhaps as far as Salonika.   Theger was grave enough to justify immediate precautions.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that there was no divergence between the Frenchand British points of view on the fundamental issues. He wished, however, tobe quite clear as to the character of the operations which the preparations nowproposed by M. Daladier were intended to facilitate. Four Balkan countries hadbeen mentioned; and he would take YYigo-Slavia as an example. Was it proposed merely to encourage and help that country to resist a possible german attack, or to go further and send an Allied force there? The latter was atormidable proposition, which would result in diverting forces from the maintneatre of war in the West, and might well be open to considerable objection atany rate at the present stage.I      Turkey was, of course, the strongest of the four countries in a military sensetana tier strength and determination should be a stimulus to the others    He.uieretore thought that M. Daladier&apos;s object might best be secured bv helping,5   key to tne fullest extent, rather than by sending forces to the Balkans andipereby. incidentally, provoking serious difficulties in regard to Italy[20710] -    B2snaidai
M. DALADIER explained that the first essential, in his view, was toundertake diplomatic action with a view to bringing about a full measure of collaboration between the four countries. Until quite recently none of them had succeeded in sinking their differences; yet each was terrified that it mightindividually suffer the fate of Poland. If they could be induced to stand togetherwith French and British support, the enemy might well hesitate to attack. Thepolitical situation was, therefore, all important: the isolationist tendency was at the moment less marked, and the opportunity must be seized to encourage the formation of a body united for self-defence. ^As regards concrete&quot;assistance, he was equally anxious not to divert effectivesfrom the West. In the absence of bases, transport and supply facilities, &amp;e.,the despatch of an Allied Expeditionary Force to the Balkans would be a dangerous mistake. Concurrently with the diplomatic drive, however, the Alliesmight well enter into preparatory technical discussions through the General Staffs. Intervention in Yugo-Slavia was not necessarily the ultimate object :assistance to and co-ordination of aims with Turkey was a much more likely-objective, and one which would not arouse Italian susceptibilities. Turkey,moreover, urgently required certain war materials; and, even at the cost ofsacrifices, he thought those materials should be given her, and given as quickly as possible. A very early, if limited, instalment was best calculated to demonstrate continuity of Allied policy.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN thanked M. Daladier for this explanation. one point was, however, not yet quite clear to him. M. Daladier had spoken of aBalkan bloc, each member of which would go to the assistance of any otherif attacked. But the respective positions of the Balkan countries differed very greatly, and he found it difficult to believe that they would all agree to entersuch a bloc, merely on the strength of mutual support. Would, for example,Yugoslavia, be expected to agree, knowing that she would get nothing furtherfrom the Allies than certain war supplies ?M. DALADIER said that he was looking at the situation as a whole; he wished to bring about unity in the Balkans so as to discourage a possible german or Russian attack. The four countries in question had, after all, ninety divisionsbetween them.If to answer Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s question Yugoslavia were to ask what assistance she herself was to get, the reply would, be : &quot; Nothing to Yugoslavia,in isolation, but help, supplies, collaboration in such matters as transport facilities, &amp;c, if Yugoslavia joins with the other countries with a view to their common defence.&quot; At this stage, only diplomatic and technical collaborationwould be in question; only later would the possibility of direct Allied actionemerge. Even that action would, moreover, be limited. These countries withtheir ninety divisions were not short of man-power, but he would emphasise thatthe first essential need was for diplomatic action and technical p re pa r a t j on.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN pointed out that the first victim of German attackAvould presumably be Yugoslavia; that was why he had chosen that country as an illustration. Assuming that the bloc was in process of formation, what,help would Yugoslavia receive if attacked ? Although there were many divisions in the Balkans, their military value was unequal, and unless much closer military co-operation-ordination was brought about than he thought at all possible, there was little prospect of the emergence of a Balkan force united for defence.The main question, however, on which there was already complete agreement,was the need for ensuring, at the very least, the benevolent neutrality of Italy,before any Allied operation in the Balkans could be undertaken. Unless thiswas secured, the shipping problem alone a problem which was becoming steadilymore serious and difficult would prove insurmountable. If we made&quot; promisesto the Balkans and. gave them assurances necessarily dependent upon the attitudeof Italy, and if when the moment came for implementing those assurances Italyturned hostile, then a most unfortunate situation would arise. He would wish,therefore, first to be assured regarding the attitude of Italy. A direct question to Italy would, however, provoke the reply that the Italian attitude largely&quot;depended upon the intentions of the Allies in the Balkans. Hence his question,and his concern not to awaken Italian hostility. He, did not, at the same time,wish to imply that no preparations were possible without incurring the risk ofarousing that hostility.
o...M. DALADIER said that he recognized the importance of the Italian factor in the realisation of our Balkan plans. But we could.at,once, give our technical assistance to the Balkan countries, and it was on this plane that we could concludean agreement with them.* Mr, CHAMBERLAIN said that he would like an approach to be made toItaly, and an indication to be given her of Allied intentions. The Italians wouldthen ask how far those intentions went, and whether they were designed for purely defensive purposes, or implied action affecting Italian interests. If theobject of the Allies was merely to assist the Balkan countries in preserving their independence against aggression, Italy would have no justifiable grounds onwhich to object.M. DALADIER said that he was in full agreement with Mr. Chamberlain,The Italian factor was of paramount importance, and nothing must be done to arouse Italian suspicions. The maintenance of the integrity of the balkan countries was, of course, wholly in Italy&apos;s interests, and a collapse of thosecountries would gravely compromise her position. Whatever reasons of prestige,or of a personal character, &amp;c, might be involved, she could not at heart desireto see Germany or Russia drive through to the iEgean.. Great Britain and France might, of course, acquaint Italy with their exactintentions and watch how Italy reacted to the proposed staff conversations and supplies of war materials, both of which could be undertaken at once, and thatwould allow us to gain time. But if an uncompromising question was put toItaly forthwith, her official position vis-a-vis Germany would be very awkward,and it might therefore be wiser to postpone the approach until the preparationshad made some progress. Italy could not be expected to make a formal admissionof disloyalty to the Axis. Nevertheless, a conflict of views had been clearly-apparent in Italy since the outbreak of war; while official utterances continuedto claim complete allegiance to the Axis policy, private assurances were of a very different character. It was therefore clear that Italy felt uneasy; hence he deprecated any immediate and formal approach, but favoured a cautious watchover Italian reactions to such preparations as the Allies might undertake.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that this was a psychological issue, and assuch a matter of judgment. Lie agreed that a brusque and sudden approach would be injudicious, and that caution and discretion were necessary. On theother hand, to say nothing to Italy, in the hope that she would take no noticeof what was being done, would be exceedingly dangerous. She would inevitablysuspect the Allies of the worst motives. The British Ambassador in Rome wason very good terms personally with Count Ciano. He would therefore suggestthat the wisest course would be to make an unofficial approach to the ItalianGovernment through our Ambassador at Rome, explaining that the Alliescontemplated certain action with strictly defined limits designed to help the balkan countries to preserve their independence. Such a step could not embarrassItaly or embroil her with Germany. She might, of course, resent even thatcautious approach. If so, French and. British Ministers would have to meet again to consider the matter anew. The fact remained, however, that no allied action in the Balkans was possible without Italy&apos;s goodwill; failing that, thewhole project must be abandoned, and he was wholly opposed to any action carriedout behind Italy&apos;s back.M. DALADIER pointed out that guarantees had been given to Greece and roumania, and that those guarantees would have to be implemented. Moreover,the French had permanent military contacts with Yugoslavia and Roumania,and through these contacts preparatory action of a discreet character could betaken. France and Great Britain were also now bound towards Turkey; andif Turkey were in danger, that obligation too would have to be met. There were,therefore, some forms of action which the Allies might be compelled to takewhatever the attitude of Italy. Moreover, the guarantees to Greece and roumania had been given, and the obligations towards Turkey entered into, without consulting Italy.At the same time, it was obvious that Italian neutrality was of essentialimportance and that private approaches were wholly desirable. The balkan countries themselves would no doubt desire to discuss matters with Italy, if and when the Allied intentions took shape.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that naturally the pledges given would be respected, but that he deprecated any action likely to render the situation moreembarrassing than it was. The pledges had been given when Europe was atpeace; the way in which they were to be implemented, if the countries concerned were attacked, was to declare war on the attacker. There had been no questionof sending a force through the Mediterranean : we had merely undertaken togive what help we could. To-day, in pursuance of one of those pledges, we were at war with Germany: that was something we could do and had done. y .But we could not send a force across the Mediterranean to defend turkey in the fane of Italian hostility. To do so, we should first have to defeat Italy.The question was not whether, but how pledges were to be carried out. Hereally saw no objection to a private approach to Italy; that, in his view, wasthe best way in which to avoid arousing Italian hostility.M. DALADIER said that he entirely agreed, but that that did not prevent us from doing what we had to do in regard to the Balkan countries, nor from continuing the existing military contacts between the French and the BalkanGeneral Staffs, with a view to making certain technical preparations. The two points of view were not mutually exclusive.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN agreed, but said that they would have to proceedwith caution. He was apprehensive of the Italian reaction if we took actionbefore telling Count Ciano what was proposed. The British Ambassador in rome had reported a conversation between Count Ciano and the french ambassador on the 16th September according to which the French ambassador had given an undertaking to inform the Italian Government before the FrenchGovernment took action to build up a Balkan bloc. We had given a similarundertaking, and it was clear that Italy considered it of the utmost importance that she should be kept informed of any contemplated Allied action designed tobring about a strengthening of the position of the Balkan countries. He feltvery strongly that some preliminary hint should be given to the Italians before any Staff Conversations of a new character were entered into. Italy would then,at any rate, have nothing to reproach the Allies with.M. DALADIER thought it possible that undue emphasis had been laid onthe report of Count Ciano&apos;s conversation with the French Ambassador, from whom he had not himself received the definite impression Mr. Chamberlainappeared to have received. The point was not, however, of paramount importance.He was in agreement with Mr. Chamberlain except on the single issue that he himself saw no objection of Staff Conversations with Balkan countries being actively pursued without a previous specific approach to Italy. Perhaps the two points of view might be harmonised by deciding that normal staff contacts should,for the moment, be maintained, and meanwhile that a private discreet approach to the Italian Government should be made through the diplomatic channel.Mr. CIIA M B E R L AIN agreed to the suggested course of action. Hesuggested that Sir Percy Loraine should act as an intermediary in Italy.M. DALADIER accepted this suggestion.LORD HALIFAX referred to the recent conversations with the TurkishSecretary-General in London. M. Numan had arranged to see the british minister in Sofia on his way home. It would be appropriate to initiate actionin the Balkans through Turkey, and the meeting in Sofia would provide a suitable occasion for taking a sounding of Balkan views. He undertook to acquaint theFrench with the result of the meeting at the earliest moment.The Supreme War Council agreed as follows :  (1) It is most important that the Balkan Countries, and in particularTurkey, Yugoslavia, Greece and Roumania, should be encouraged and assisted to form themselves into a bloc with a view to co-ordinatingtheir resources to meet German and/or Russian aggression.(2) The above encouragement and assistance should for the present take theform of-(i) Diplomatic action.(ii) A supply as generous as possible of Avar material from Franco-British sources.   .
(iii) Preparatory measures on a limited scale to make possible in caseof necessity ultimate intervention by Franco-British armed forces; for example, the conduct of conversations between themilitary staffs, the organisation of bases, &amp;c.(3) There can be no question of the despatch of any Franco-British armed forces even on a limited scale, unless Italy is at least a definitelybenevolent neutral. The attitude of Italy is, in fact, an overriding consideration and it is essential to avoid offending her susceptibilities.(4) It would be impossible to take the action contemplated in Resolution (2)above without the knowledge of Italy. It would therefore be advisable to make an informal approach to the Italian Government inorder to explain to them precisely what the French and british governments have in mind, and to ascertain their reactions beforeinitiating action on the lines contemplated. This informal approach should be made forthwith by the British Ambassador at Rome to count Ciano. He would emphasise the preparatory and defensivecharacter of the steps proposed against possible aggression in the balkans by Germany and/or Russia.(5) Pending the result of this approach, no fresh staff conversations shouldbe initiated with the Balkan Powers, but this should not prevent theFrench General Staff from continuing any normal staff conversationsalready in progress.(6) It would be appropriate to initiate diplomatic action in the Balkancapitals through the Turkish Government, and the first step should therefore be to enlist the co-operation of that Government. In thisconnection the Council took note that the Turkish Secretary-general was to have a discussion with the British Minister at Sofia on his return journey to Angora, and that this would form a convenient opportunity for considering what further diplomatic action could betaken in the Balkan capitals, to build up a common Balkan front, andthat the results of this discussion would be communicated to theFrench Government as early as possible.2. Air Supplies from the United States of America.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN referred to M. Daladier&apos;s letter to him of the11th December urging the paramount importance of gaining a clear superiorityover the enemy in the air at the earliest possible moment. While he appreciated the desirability of increasing the supply of aircraft from the United States tothe fullest possible extent, he feared that, in the circumstances, a redirection ofthe present American output might result in delay in the supply of machine toolsfrom the United States to British aircraft manufacturers. He was satisfied that more aircraft could be produced in Britain within a given period, provided thenecessary machine tools continued to arrive from the United States, than wouldbe produced if some adjustment were made in the existing arrangements of american industry with the object of increasing the output of aircraft inAmerica. The American aircraft industries were, he understood, already working to capacity. Any change in the existing arrangements would not only result in a reduction of the supply of machine tools to Great Britain, and hencein the output of the British aircraft industries, but would yield little benefit onthe American side, since it was doubtful whether any aircraft additional to those covered by existing contracts could be produced in that country before 1941.He was obliged to add that the existing financial commitments of GreatBritain in this respect had already reached the limit of the available foreign exchange. At the same time, he was not opposed to the inquiry suggested byM. Daladier, and was quite prepared to appoint a British representative to take part in it. .M. DALADIER explained that the Mission now on its way to the UnitedStates had purely exploratory functions. We were agreed that nothing shouldbe done which might delay the delivery of the necessary machine tools. His chiefhope was that it might prove possible to adapt the United States motor-carindustry to the requirements of aircraft production in a fairly short period.
Tlie foreign exchange situation naturally required to be watched carefully. TheFrench were restricting their use of foreign exchange as much as possible, withthe specific object of keeping every dollar for the purchase of aeroplanes, therebyhastening on that superiority in the air which was so essential if victory was tobe gained within a relatively short space of time.The Supreme War Council Took note that the British Government would appoint a representative to take part in the inquiry instituted by the French Government as to thepossibilities of increasing the output of aircraft and air engines in theUnited States of America.3. The Position in Northern Europe.Possible Assistance to Finland and Scandinavia.LORD HALIFAX said that he felt certain that the attitude adopted by france and Great Britain at the recent meetings of the Council and Assemblyof the League at Geneva had enhanced their standing in the eyes of the UnitedStates, Italy, Spain and Japan. The concrete problem now was, how further to strengthen the position of the Scandinavian countries, a position which had some bearing on European affairs generally. The longer Finland could resist the Soviet attack, the harder it would prove for Russia to take the initiative inthe Balkans.   Everything should, therefore, be done to strengthen Scandinavia.France and Great Britain both considered that they must do everything possible to give Finland direct assistance. They had already sent much material,and they intended to continue to do so, this being the best form of encouragementthey could give to public opinion in Norway and Sweden. It seemed, however(and the British Government wholly concurred with the French in this respect),that diplomatic action at Stockholm and Oslo might help to persuade the twocountries that it was essential, for them to take positive action. That was the first point to be considered.The Foreign Office was also endeavouring to form an idea of possible develop-ments in the immediate future. There were two main alternatives : Russia mightsucceed in overcoming Finnish resistance rapidly; or she might meet withprolonged resistance, due to direct aid from Sweden or at least to Swedish consent to the passage through her territory of warlike supplies to Finland. In the latter case, Russia might endeavour to interfere with the transport of supplies acrossSweden and, in that event, Germany might also intervene in order to preserveher access to Northern Sweden and safeguard her supplies of iron ore fromthat part of the country. The Allies would then be faced with an extensionof the war, either concealed or open, affecting both Norway and Sweden. Subjectto M. Daladier&apos;s concurrence, he wished to suggest that the result of the ForeignOffice studies, together with any information the French might have, shouldbe pooled with a view to joint examination and to a discussion of possible actionin Northern Europe, especially in the military sphere.&apos; &apos; . M. DALADIER agreed that the French and British attitudes at Geneva,and the help the two countries had given to Finland, had had a most favourablemoral and political effect throughout the world. The two countries must clearlypursue their efforts and continue to send the greatest possible amount of materialhelp to Finland.Russia might soon overcome Finland&apos;s resistance, and would then gain access to the nickel mines in the north of the country. Possibly her action would belimited to the territory of the invaded country. There was, however, another and! far more serious hypothesis; Russian ambition might not be limited to finland; she might, in collusion (whether secret or public) with Germany, try to overrun the whole Scandinavian Peninsula.M. Daladier had recently received some extremely illuminating information regarding a report prepared by Herr Thyssen, the German industrialmagnate, who had now taken refuge in Switzerland. Thyssen considered thaipossession of the Swedish mineral deposits would enable Germany to pursueher war effort for a very much longer period. The note in M. Daladier&apos;s nosfc?-sion (a copy of which.tie would hand over to the British Delegation)showed
that before leaving Germany, Thyssen had sent herr Hitler a report showing that Germany&apos;s existing stocks of raw materials, and particularly of iron ores,Avere so much below her requirements that the exact date on which the shortageof supplies would compel her to capitulate could be calculated. The report had also been sent to Goring. The German leaders had considered its contents so&quot;damaging that they had sent a delegation of German industrialists to Switzer-land to urge Thyssen to return to Germany, with the promise that all hispossessions would be restored to him and that he would be reinstated in his formerposition, on condition that all copies of the report were destroyed. Thyssen had refused, whereupon the German Government had confiscated the whole of his private fortune and industrial interests. The actual text of the report might soon be available, and a copy would be forwarded to London. The information alreadyto hand indicated that Thyssen&apos;s views were that that side would win whichsucceeded in gaining possession of the iron ore deposits, and particularly of themagnetic ores near the northern extremity of the Gulf of Bothnia. If Russiasucceeded in laying hold on those deposits, she would have the whip-hand, andwould be in a position either to supply Germany exclusively, thereby prolonging the latter&apos;s resistance and creating conditions favourable to world revolution bywearing out both sides, or to blackmail Germany by withholding supplies. If, onthe contrary, the Allies gained control of the ore deposits, Germany&apos;s power of resistance would soon be broken.All Goring&apos;s attempts to- replace the Swedish ores by other ores with a loweriron content had failed. Germany was wholly dependent upon the Swedishsupplies and would be brought to her knees if they failed her. Herr Thyssen wasa. devout Catholic and was believed to have sent a copy of his report to the Vatican.The Allies were, therefore, now warned : hardly 150 kilometres from theFinnish frontier, only a few days&apos; march for a victorious Russian army, weredeposits of first grade ore with a very high iron content (1,600 million tons atKiruna Vara and 400 million tons at Galivare) The annual yield amounted to approximately 8 million tons, of which 75 per cent, went to Germany, 15 per cent,to the United Kingdom, and 5 per cent, or 6 per cent, to the United States. Four-fifths of the exports went through the Norwegian port of Narvik, which wasaccessible throughout the year, and the remainder through Lulea, which was ice-bound from November to March. Both ports had equipment capable of loadinga medium-sized ship in two hours. Ships loaded at Lulea could reach Germanydown the Baltic without going outside Swedish territorial waters.The question was one of paramount importance. If it was overlooked,Germany might seize the iron ore deposits and be placed in a position to prolong-the war by one or even two years.He (M. Daladier) had prepared draft instructions which he intended to send to the French diplomatic representatives at Oslo and Stockholm. Very probably a diplomatic demarche would lead to requests for material assistance, and thusonce again raise a problem with which the Allies were becoming familiar. an approach to Norway and Sweden ought nevertheless, in his view, to be made.His information was that the Norwegian Government was entirely passive. in sweden, on the other hand, public opinion was thought to be encouraging; andthe King was reported to be much more favourable to the adoption of a vigorous,attitude than his Government.LORD HALIFAX said that the British Representatives fully appreciated the importance of the problem of the iron ores. Much thought had been givento the question on the British side, where the conclusions reached were very similar to those of the French. He would welcome communication of the note towhich M. Daladier had referred, and would also be glad to study the text of thedraft instructions intended for the French diplomatic representatives in scandinavia. He felt certain that there would be agreement as to the principleof joint action in Sweden and Norway.(A copy of the draft instructions was then handed across the table.)Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that the text required close study and that hewould have to consult his colleagues. The draft instructions appeared at a firstglance to involve a considerable modification of the attitude so far maintained by Great Britain. This might greatly affect Allied relations with Russia. GreatBritain did not as vet wish to declare war on Russia.[20710] c
LORD HALIFAX added that, so far, help to Finland had taken the formof an authorisation to British firms to supply war material privately. Theprocedure had. in effect, been similar to that followed by Italy in regard to Spain,and the object had been not to complicate British relations with Russia.The Supreme War Council : (1) Agreed as to the importance of rendering all possible assistance to finland, and of taking diplomatic action in Sweden and Norwaywith a view to strengthening the determination of those countries to resist acts of aggression,(2) Took note that the draft instructions prepared by the French Governmentfor despatch to British and French Ministers in Sweden and Norwaywith a view to joint diplomatic action, would be examined by theBritish Government through the normal diplomatic channels as soonas possible.4. Joint Declaration by France and Great Britain that no Separate Peace willbe concluded.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN referred to the history of this proposal. Since itwas unthinkable that either country would make peace without the other, thewhole value of such a declaration lay in its psychological effect. He was willingto examine any proposal for a form of words suitable to a declaration of the determination of France and Great Britain not to conclude a separate Peace.M. DALADIER agreed with this view, and said that such a declaration would have undoubted value in countering that form of German propaganda which sought to create a rift between the Allies. It would, however, have to be carefully studied, since it involved to some degree the vast problem of Alliedpeace aims. He did not wish to enter into that problem at the present stage,but indicated that the general French view was opposed both to what mr. Chamberlain had recently described as &quot;Generous Utopias&quot; and to suchdrastic but equally illusory solutions as a dismemberment of Germany. Francedid not believe that to bring about the downfall of Hitler was sufficient. AnotherHitler would arise in his stead, and the whole trouble would recur within a fewyears. What was required was real guarantees of lasting peace, and his personal view was that no guarantee could replace a strategic and military (but not a territorial) frontier running along the left bank of the Rhine.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN agreed that the suggested declaration raised far-reaching issues which would have to be closely investigated. At the present stage he would only say that in the British view the mere downfall of hitler was not a sufficient guarantee of lasting peace, although it was an essential pre-requisite of such a peace. On the British side also there was a determination to obtain lasting guarantees. He had heard M. Daladier&apos;s personal views with much interest : could he become convinced that the particular guarantee suggestedby the latter would assure what they both desired, he would examine its implications with the keenest interest. This was, however, not the occasion toenter into a detailed discussion of a complex problem, many factors of which were still imponderable. He fully agreed, however, that at some later stage a full discussion would be very desirable. A Memorandum had been prepared as aresult of a recent conversation with M. Corbin. which might possibly serve asa basis of discussion. This Memorandum would be communicated to the FrenchGovernment.The Supreme War Council Agreed that a suitable opportunity should be taken to study the termsof a Joint Declaration to the proposed effect.

Fecamp Broadcasting Station.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN stated that, in the British military view, thecontinued operation of the Fecamp Broadcasting Station involved a definite danger to the British Expeditionary Force and. indeed, to the defence of the southern part of England. The British authorities strongly desired that this stations should be closed down.M. DALADIER thought that the danger might be eliminated if the station were synchronised with other French transmitters. A proposal had been madeto the British authorities on the 4th November to which no reply had yet beenreceived for a system of liaison providing for the instant closing down of allthe Broadcasting Stations in question when an air raid warning was given.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that he was advised that such arrangements were definitely held on the British side to be inadequate.After some further discussion, M. DALADIER suggested that the matter should be referred to military experts representing both countries. He wouldbe prepared to abide by their decision.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN welcomed this suggestion and said that he would be equally prepared to accept the verdict of the proposed joint military body.The Supreme War Council : Agreed that the question of the continued operation of the FecampBroadcasting Station should be referred to the military experts of both countries, and that their decision whether this Station should be allowedto continue, and, if so. under what conditions, should be accepted by both Governments.6. Despatch of British Troops to France.M. DALADIER urged an acceleration of the rate of despatch of Britisheffectives to France. France had men of 47-48 uncle]&apos; arms and 1 man in 7 wasmobilised. Nothing, he said, would have a, greater effect on French morale.He hastened to add, however, that France was unanimous in recognising thatGreat Britain had fulfilled her undertakings with complete loyalty and up tothe hilt,Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that he appreciated the spirit in which m. Daladier&apos;s request was made. The immense difficulty of transporting,equipping and maintaining a large Expeditionary Force, made it extremely unlikely, however, that Britain could go beyond her present commitments. Theproblem of equipping the Force was, of course, the determining factor. he felt certain that the promised total of ten fully equipped Divisions by the1st March represented the absolute limit of what the British side could contributetip to that date.M. DALADIER fully recognised that the existing British effort was veryconsiderable and that the problem of equipment was a very serious one. Possibly,however, a somewhat less generous degree of equipment he mentioned machinegnns, of which the French had 1 for 40 men while the British had 1 for 15 than that aimed at at present for the British Forces, which appeared to exceedconsiderably that allowed to the French Forces, would allow of. a substantialaddition to the numbers of men at present constituting the British ExpeditionarvForce.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that the scales of equipment of the british expeditionary Force were now being examined. There were considerablevariations in individual weapons, but he believed that, on the whole, the scale wasnot appreciably more generous than that applied to the French Forces. It mustbe borne in mind that Great Britain was also faced with the problem of main-taming a very large army of labourers in France.   Many aerodromes had still to
be built to meet immediate requirements, and the existing demands of supply and organisation laid on the Government a tremendous responsibility, to which he doubted whether any addition could possibly be made.&quot;&apos;   The Supreme War Council Took note of the statements made by the French and British PrimeMinisters as to the desirability of accelerating the despatch of Britisheffectives to France, and of the factors which, in the view of the BritishGovernment, made it impossible to send more than 10 fully-equippedDivisions by the 1st March.7. Press Communique.M. DALADIER said that the text of the following Press Communique,.to be issued that afternoon, had already been approved by both sides : A Meeting of the Supreme War Council was held in Paris to-day(Tuesday). The Council sat throughout the morning. M. Daladier, M. Guyla Chambre, M. Champetier de Ribes, General Gamelin and Admiral Darlan,who were accompanied by M. Leger, represented France. Mr. Chamberlain,Lord Halifax, and Lord Chatfield, who were accompanied by Sir RonaldCampbell, General Ironside, and Sir Alexander Cadogan, represented GreatBritain.In welcoming the British representatives M. Daladier congratulatedGreat Britain on the gallant and victorious action which had led to thedestruction of the Admiral Graf Spee.The Supreme War Council made a close study of the general situation,and found that the British and French Governments were completely atone on all the questions discussed. The Council accordingly took such decisions as were required to make the best use of the means of action at thejoint disposal of the two countries in the diplomatic and military spheres.(The Supreme War Council adjourned.)December 19, 1939.
