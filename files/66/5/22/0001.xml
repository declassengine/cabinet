naval SITUATION.General Review?. na -The outstanding event at sea during the past week has been the severeattack on shipping off the East Coast by German aircraft on the 29th and30th January.Attacks by U-boats continue to exact a heavier toll of Neutral vessels, notin convoy, than of British shipping. In spite of very adverse weather conditions the convoy system has maintained the flow of shipping, both Allied and Neutral,and in the only case of a successful attack by a U-boat, on a British convoy theU-boat was subsequently sunk.The third Canadian troop convoy has sailed from Halifax escorted by twobattleships, one cruiser and four Canadian destroyers.Home Waters.2. The Northern Patrol has been maintained by cruisers and armed merchant cruisers. Heavy ships of the Home Fleet have been at sea supporting the NorthernPatrol and covering convoys to and from Norway.As a result of information received that ships carrying iron-ore to germany were proceeding outside Norwegian territorial waters, three destroyers were sentto search the Norwegian coast in the vicinity of Jaederens Point, but met with no success.The s.s. Durham. Castle, prepared as a block ship to obstruct one of the approaches to Scapa Flow, was sunk by torpedo or mine in the Moray Firth whilstbeing towed to Scapa.3. Extensive attacks on shipping on the East Coast were carried out by german aircraft on the 29th and 30th January. A dive-bombing attack wasmade on H.M.S. Coventry and s.s. Manela at Sollum Voe in the Shetlandson the 29th January, and on the 30th January H.M.S. Niger, a minesweeper,had one killed and two wounded as a result of being bombed off Invergordon,although the ship herself was undamaged. Details of the air attacks on shippingare given in Appendix III. Four British ships were sunk and five wrecked. OneNeutral ship was wrecked. None of these ships were in convoy. The total tonnage lost by air attack was 28,065 tons, of which 24,341 tons were British.Forty-four other merchant ships, as well as minesweepers and trawlers, were also bombed and machine-gunned (see Appendix II), and in addition attacks were carried out on the Dudgeon, Galloper, Humber and Kentish Knock light vessels.The Dudgeon was damaged and her crew of eight are missing. A south-bound convoy was attacked on both days without success.It is estimated that there were at least 67 casualties to personnel, but fullreports have not yet been received.4. In addition to the above-mentioned losses by air attack 18 ships, totalling34,090 tons, were lost by either mine or torpedb; of these 2 were British, 2 Frenchand 14 Neutral.  The total loss from all causes is 27 ships of 62,155 tons.Foreign Waters.5. The British s.s. Wing Sang (3,560 tons) was stopped, searched anddetained for fifteen hours by a Japanese minesweeper off Foochow. The detention of this vessel was apparently a reprisal for the s.s. A sama Marti incident.A despatch has been received from the Naval Attache, Buenos Aires, reporting on the visit of Rear-Admiral Harwood in H.M.S. A jaw to Montevideo and ofH.M.S. Achilles to Buenos Aires. A summary of some further information regarding the defeat of the A admiral Graf Spee contained in the despatch is givenin Appendix I.Protection of Seaborne Trade. :   &apos;   v &apos;6. 500 ships, including 384 British, 22 Allied and 94 Neutral, have beenconvoyed during the week. Included in this number are five ocean convoys, twofrom Sierra Leone, two from Halifax and one from Gibraltar. One ship, theGreek s.s. Keremiai, was torpedoed in convoy. Two ships were lost as a result ofdropping astern of their convoys, s.s. Vaclite by torpedo and s.s. Eston by mine.
Two Norwegian convoys, one outward and one homeward, have arrived safely,the homeward convoy consisting of 66 ships, only 3 of which were British.38 destroyers, 14 escort vessels and 1 submarine have been employed on convoy escourt duties, and 2 battleships, 2 cruisers and, 6 armed merchant cruisers asocean escorts.Anti-Submarine Operations. .&apos; 7. It is estimated that six U-Boats have been operating during the past week, including two, or possibly three, off the west coasts of Spain and Portugal.Following the sinking of the Latvian s.s. Everene and the Norwegian s.s. Gudveigoff the Fame Islands on the 25th January, attacks on contacts were delivered by H.M.S. Vega and H.M.S. Woolston, but without definite result.On the same day H.M.S. Vanquisher attacked a very good contact south-westward of Nash Point (South Wales), after which a large amount of oil was seen, but the fact of the position being close to the wreck of s.s. Stanholme throwssome doubt on the success of this attack. The Polish destroyer Blyslcawica also made one attack on the 25th with depth charges after sighting a periscope20 miles east of Yarmouth.8. After sinking the s.s. Vaclite (5,026 tons) and the Greek s.s. Keramiai(5,085 tons) 100 miles S.W. of The Lizard, U. 55 was attacked by H.M.S. Foweywith depth charges, and also by the French destroyer Valmy. Subsequently,a British Sunderland aircraft sighted the U-Boat on the surface apparentlyunable to dive. After dropping a bomb which registered a near miss, the aircraft was engaged by machine-gun fire, which she returned. The flying boat theninformed the convoy escort of the position of the TJ-Boat. On their arrival theU-Boat had sunk, but fortv-one survivors were picked up bv H.M.S. Fowey and h.M.S. WHITSHED.9. The heavy work of destroyers hunting U-Boats is being assisted by theformation of A/S striking forces, each consisting of four or five specially-equipped trawlers. Twenty-two such striking forces are to be formed, and aconsiderable number are already in active operation.German Mine Laying.10. There has been no definite intelligence of German mine laying duringthe past week, and as the Germans are using electric torpedoes, which aretrackless, it is exceedingly difficult when a ship is sunk to say if she has been mined or torpedoed. A completely new type of German mine has been washedashore at Yarmouth and is at present being examined. Another German aircraftmine was found on the beach at Whitstable. Part of the mechanism has been removed, and it hoped to salvage the whole mine, which is deeply embedded inthe mud, at the next spring tides.British Minesweeping.11. The usual routine sweeps were carried out as far as the severe weather conditions permitted. A moored mine was swept up slightly out of the Tyne warchannel and H.M.S. Borde successfully exploded four magnetic mines near theSunk Light Vessel.Three Wellington bombers have now been fitted for minesweeping and afurther four are in hand, but it has not been possible to fly them because of the weather conditions.Demagnetisation trials are continuing in H.M. submarine L. 26 and h.M.S. Arethusa.British Contraband Control.12. During the week under review 3,148 tons of cargo were seized in prize.On the 30th January there were 29 neutral ships in the contraband control bases inthe United Kingdom, of which 18 had been there for five days already. The totalincluded 11 Dutch, 5 Norwegians, 4 Belgian, 4 Danish and 3 Greek, also 1 Finnishand 1 Swedish ship.[20743] B 2
German Poland and East PrussiaMoravia and Bohemia      ...Austria        ...      ...Baltic Coast ...       ...       ...Central Germanv    ... ::During the week ending the 27th January the Contraband Committee dealtwith the cargoes of 107 ships which had arrived since the 20th January and21 outstanding cargoes from the previous week. In 84 cases the entire cargoeswere released, either on first consideration or after enquiry.The period of stay to which a neutral ship must submit under the British&apos;Contraband Control has been considerably reduced since the beginning of thewar, and compares very favourably with the delay encountered in the Germancourts, where a stay of anything up to two months is possible.German Merchant Shipping.13. Since the middle of January German merchant ships in Spanish portshave displayed a considerable amount of activity. There are still over twentyships at Vigo and others at Huelva, Bilbao, Seville, Cadiz and Las Palmas.In their journey from Huelva up the Guadalquiver River to Seville on the28th-29 January the Helios, 3,821 tons, Porto, 2,185 tons, and Seville/,, 1,995 tons,are said to have been escorted by Spanish gunboats.14. There is a possibility that the German iron ore ships making their way in Norwegian territorial waters are leaving the coast in the neighbourhood ofChristiansand in order to pass into the Kattegat. A further report states that,owing to Belts being closed by ice, these ships proceed from the Naze to the Skawand thence to Hantsholm.During the night of the 23rd January a large German ship was reported tohave passed Oslo Fjord loaded with a cargo of guns and ammunition forMurmansk in Russia. Later, two ships of 11,000 tons, similarly loaded, were reported in Helsingborg, where Swedish pilots refused to meet them. A reportfrom Haugesund received to-day confirms the refusal of the Norwegian pilots,although the German Consul at Haugesund is said to have offered &quot; any money.&quot;A large, loaded German ship was observed off the coast near Arendal, boundnorthwards, on the night of the 26th January, and is now believed to be off thecoast near christians and without a pilot.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.15. The week under review has been very quiet. Hard frost and deep snow,followed by a thaw, have presumably been responsible for the lull in Germanpatrolling. Most of the 50th Division and about half of the 51st Division have completed disembarkation in France.Germany.Distribution of the German Army.16. The distribution of the German Army was last reported on the7th December in Resume No. 14. At that time between ninety-three andninety-seven divisions were believed to be on the Western Front. The latest estimate is as follows : -Divisions.... 100177464Total        ..........       .....     138In addition to the above divisions, whose formation is complete, there are believed to be another 35-40 divisions in training camps and barracks in Germany.17. There have been no recent changes on the Dutch and Belgian frontiers,where the number of troops is about the same as in November. Reports state thatcertain points on the Polish-Roumanian frontier have been occupied by german troops, who are believed to consist chiefly of engineer and railway personnel.
Reports of German troop concentrations in Slovakia have not been confirmed, andit is thought that the only German personnel in the country, apart from theMilitary Mission and a few staff officers, are specialists engaged on improvingcommunications. There is no further information regarding the reportedformation of a new Army Group in Austria.18. There are no indications that an expeditionary force is being concen-trated on the Baltic Coast for action against Scandinavia. A recent report thatunits stationed in the Lubeck area had been transferred to the interior tends to confirm this view, as it is a normal procedure in the German Army for new units,after attaining a certain stage in their depot training, to be sent to camps for field training in co-operation with other units of the division. It is thought thatthe forces in this area do not exceed those normally stationed there in time ofpeace.The Railway Situation.,19. The German railways have been worked at high pressure for the last three years, but rolling-stock and the permanent-way have not been maintained on a corresponding scale. As a result there is a shortage of locomotives and goodswagons, and axle failures are showing a significant rise. There is also evidenceof an acute shortage of skilled railway labour.On the other hand, there is no reason to presume that the railway system is onthe verge of collapse. The closing down of retail enterprise and the immobiliza-tion of merchant shipping have given Germany a pool of labour, admittedlyunskilled at railway work, but available to replace railwaymen now in the fighting forces. Moreover, Germany can borrow large numbers of wagons from adjoiningcountries and, so long as armaments wastage remains at a low level, material andworkshop space can be readily made available for repairs and overhauls..The most critical period is likely to be the remaining winter months, whilethe staff is suffering from fatigue and. the canals and rivers are out of operation.Slovakia.20. Reports have been received indicating the Slovak Government&apos;s desireto increase the army to six or eight divisions. Though the necessary equipment for at least six divisions was at one time available after the Czecho-Slovak army was disbanded, it is doubtful if this is the case to-day, as the Germans seized allsurplus Czecho-Slovak material some time ago. The present strength of theSlovak army is estimated at about 40,000-60,000, all ranks.Hungary.21. No credence is to be given to the rumours which persist concerning the arrival of Italian troops in Hungary. The presence of Italian officers on attach-ment to the Hungarian army is, however, admitted. It is possible that they areacting as instructors.Soviet Russia.22. Great care has evidently been taken to prevent the circulation of news from Finland. Except in Leningrad, the occupied provinces of Poland and, toa lesser extent, in Moscow, there are no signs of any serious misgivings. in moscow and Leningrad rumour is rife and grave food shortages have made thepopulation apprehensive; the mood, however, appears to be one of apathy ratherthan of open dissent. The unrest in Poland is probably more serious and appearsto have affected units of the army of occupation. Reports, both from Poland andthe Baltic States, suggest that the Finnish campaign is far from popular withthe rank and file. Sensational press reports of purges of Red Army commandersand leading political personalities cannot be confirmed and are thought to be muchexaggerated.Further reports from Estonia help to explain the exemplary attitude of theSoviet troops towards the population, which is in marked contrast to their ratherdefiant attitude to their own officers. In one case the Estonian police arrested adrunken Russian sailor and telephoned to the Soviet Naval Command to ask whatthey should do with him.   The answer was &quot; shoot the dog.&quot;   In another case
a Soviet sentry shot an old Estonian who refused to stop when challenged in aprohibited area. Though it,turned out,that the old man was a deaf mute, thesentry was shot without trial.23. No more has been heard of German troop movements in the WesternUkraine. Germany is evidently trying to profit from Russian difficulties and isprobably demanding concessions as the price of her economic and political support.One of these concessions appears to be a measure of control over the Soviettransport system. Another may be control of the Polish oil fields, but there is no confirmation of this. The possibility of German military support for the Sovietcannot be ruled out, as the prolongation of the Soviet-Finnish war must reactunfavourably on Russia&apos;s ability to supply Germany with what she needs.Italy.24. Signor Mussolini has been receiving regular defence reports ever since october, when the Italian High Command was reorganised as a result, apparently,of the lack of preparedness for war. It is evident that the defences on theGerman frontier are not being neglected.There have been reports that one or two divisions may be returning shortlyfrom Libya. This move is somewhat unexpected. It may be due to the need for economy or, alternatively, it may be intended to relieve the Libyan formationsby others from Italy. The present garrison of Libya, apart from the equivalent of two weak divisions of native troops, which are widely distributed, is : Divisions.In Tripolitania       ...      ...       ...       ...      ...      ...      8In Cyrenaica ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      4Far East.25. Japanese forces have shown renewed activity during the week.According to press reports, operations have taken place in the desolate regions of North-West China, near the Ordos Desert, where there can be no very welldefined objective. The Japanese have also started a small drive against guerillassouth of Hangchow, on the coast of Central China. It is reported that theObject of these latter operations is to crush the Chinese troops in the vicinityand to prevent the infiltration of irregular forces to the Tai Lake District, west of Shanghai, and other areas to the north of Hangchow. The Japanese crossed the Chientang River and occupied Siaoshan, about fourteen miles to the south-east of Ffangchow. Progress was subsequently made to the south and east forsome ten or twelve miles, but on the 27th January the advance ceased. TheJapanese claim that this halt in their operations was made deliberately, but itmay well have been due to the bitter weather which is being experienced.AIR SITUATION.Royal Air Force Operations.Bomber Command.26. No offensive operations were carried out by units of the bomber command during the week. Weather conditions were again unfavourable for german mine-laying operations, and there has not been any evidence of suchactivity by their mine-laying seaplanes. A practice reconnaissance sweep in theWestern part of the North Sea was undertaken by eighteen Blenheim aircraft on the 25th, but was curtailed by fog and bad visibility. On the 26th nineWellingtons did a similar exercise, but nothing of interest was seen on eitheroccasion.Fighter Command.27. Units of the Fighter Command have been engaged in routine patrolsfor the protection of convoys, trawlers and cross-Channel shipping wheneverweather conditions and the serviceability of aerodromes permitted. Speciaipatrols were despatched on the 27th and 29th January to investigate unidentified
French Air Activity.32. A few reconnaissance patrols were undertaken during the week by theFrench Air Force on the Western Front. On one occasion a patrol was attacked by twelve enemy aircraft at extreme altitude, but the temperature was so low as toprevent firing 6n either side. On the night of the 26th-27th J anuary there were two reconnaissance missions : one following the route Ehrang-Coblenz-Wies-baden-Kreuznach-Durkheim, dropping leaflets in Coblenz and Wiesbaden, theother over Trier-Bonn-Frankfurt-Mannheim.German Air Activity.33. The past week has been notable for the resumption of German air attacks on our East Coast shipping, and on a, slightly more extensive scale than inwie past.   Details are reported in Appendix III to this Resume.   It is oossibleaircraft reported off the coast, but snow and fog assisted evasive tactics and our fighters did not succeed in making contact.&apos; On the 29th and 30th enemy bombers,acting singly and in pairs, made a number of attacks on East Coast shipping,including unarmed vessels and Lightships, using machine guns and both high explosive and incendiary bombs. Details of the results are.given elsewhere inthis Resume. Our fighters were hampered by weather and by the fact that six of the fighter aerodromes had been rendered unserviceable by the severe weather conditions; nevertheless, a total of 99 fighter aircraft were despatched on eachof these two days. On the 29th a Heinkel was engaged off the Tyne, but escapedinto clouds before a decisive attack could be delivered. On the 30th a Heinkelwas shot down 10 miles east of Coquet Island, north of Newcastle, and another was intercepted and attacked by three Hurricanes. It escaped into the clouds,but shortly afterwards an aircraft (believed to be this Heinkel) was heard sending out distress signals.Coastal Command.28. Routine patrols have been curtailed by weather conditions but were continued whenever possible, in addition to special searches for submarines,escorts for convoys and searches for survivors of merchant ships. On one day(the 25th) seventeen convoys were provided with air escort.29. With, reference to the sinking of the U-55 referred to in paragraph 8above, the flying boat had just returned from convoy escort in that vicinity onaccount of bad! weather, but on receipt of information of this attack the aircraftimmediately returned in the hope of regaining touch with the submarine. Theclouds were down to sea level, but at 3 p.m. (over three hours after H.M.S. Fowey&apos;attack) the Sunderland located the submarine on the surface, through a hole inthe clouds.30, On the 29th January a Hudson aircraft on patrol between FlamboroughHead and Horns Reef was attacked by a Messerschmitt 110 twin-engined fighter.The Hudson claims to have disabled one of the engines of the enemy aircraft,but sustained slight damage before making its escape in the clouds. On the30th January, two flights of Hudsons assisted the aircraft of Fighter command in trying to intercept the hostile bombers which were attacking our East Coastshipping off the Moray Firth and Flamborough Head, but did not succeed inmaking contact.British Air Forces in France.31. Thirty-five fighter patrols have been sent up by the Royal Air ForceComponent and the Advanced Air Striking Force during the week, but weather conditions made interception difficult, and the only combat to record is anindecisive one between three Hurricanes and a Heinkel, which took place near theLuxemburg frontier. Reconnaissance activity was much reduced by the unf favour-able weather and ground conditions. A Blenheim, which was sent out on the25th January, did not return, and the German wureless claimed that on that days British aircraft had been shot down in the neighbourhood of Duisburg by twoMesserschmitt fighters.
that the renewal of these attacks is * due to weather conditions, which have beenideal for the evasive tactics employed by.. the Germans whenever our fightersappear. The enemy may also have believed that a proportion of our fighter aircraft were grounded due to snow. Apart from these operations, there has beenvery little activity by the German Air Force.Foreign Air Intelligence.34. It is reported that a Trans-Siberian Air Service will shortly beinaugurated to link up the Berlin-Moscow and Japanese Air Transport systems.RUSSO-FINNISH HOSTILITIES.35. Ice is increasing and more or less covers the eastern end of the gulf of Finland, and the Gulf of Bothnia north of Kvarken. It has been established that one or two submarines are still operating in the Gulf of Bothnia,, where oneattacked a merchant ship in a Finnish convoy on the 13th January, without result.Owing to the lack of modern apparatus in their light craft, the Finns are finding-some difficulty in providing escorts for convoys. They are reluctant to use theirtwo armoured ships, which are well equipped, because the Russians are believed to possess sixty submarines in the Baltic Fleet.36. No important developments have occurred during the week, thoughheavy fighting has been taking place in the sector immediately north of lake ladoga, and fighting has broken out again in the centre of the Eastern frontier in the neighbourhood of Kuhmoniemi.North of Lake Ladoga, Soviet forces attacked down the railway towardsLoimola in an attempt to relieve pressure on the ISth and 168th Soviet Divisions,which have been practically isolated at Kitela. These attacks have made verylittle progress. In the Kuhmoniemi area the situation is still obscure, but theSoviet troops are said to be attacking in considerable force. In the Salla sectora temporary deadlock appears to have been reached, the Soviet troops havingbeen reinforced sufficiently to enable them to hold the Finns about fifteen miles west of Salla.For the moment the situation still remains relatively favourable for the Finns,but there are signs that they are tiring and that their attacks lack their originalsting. The Soviet troops, on the other hand, seem to have learnt something fromtheir early disasters and to be conducting their operations on sounder lines.37. A feature of the Soviet attacks on the Karelian Isthmus (which wererenewed in force on the 20th January) was the extensive use of aircraft.Two hundred Soviet aircraft were used to machine-gun the western sector of theFinnish lines and 66 bombers and 33 fighters co-operated in the attack on theeastern sector. In spite of this air assistance the Russians failed to penetratethe Finnish defences.On the 17th January a formation of eleven Russian bomber aircraft attacked the electric power station at Imatra. Owing to the vital importance of thisstation, which supplies practically the whole of Finland, the Finns have taken steps to defend it very strongly. No damage was done to the power station, butthe entire Russian formation of eleven aircraft is reported to have been destroyed.It is believed that the majority of these aircraft were shot down by Fokkersoperating from Immola.38. Aircraft now operating in Finland frequently have to be parked in the open in temperatures ranging from - 100 to 400 centigrade. It is reportedthat the two Italian Fiat fighter aircraft, which have undergone extensive trialsin Finland, have proved unsuitable for operations in the present weather conditions, because of their high landing speed and of freezing troubles with theairscrew variable pitch mechanism.
[20743]cFurther Information concerning &quot; Admiral Graf Spee,&quot; obtained as a resultof the visits of His Majesty&apos;s Ships to Montevideo and Buenos Aires.THE Admiral Graf Spee left Germany on the 21st August, and had notbeen in harbour until she finally arrived off Montevideo, by which time they were running short of provisions and rations had been slightly reduced.2. During the action the vibration was very bad and the 11-inch guns were difficult to handle while the ship was going at full speed.Most of the casualties were caused after A jaw and Achilles closed to within their range. The crews of the 5 - 9-inch guns suffered most, particularly fromshells which arrived on board from the other side of the ship and burst in rear of the guns. British shells caused greater damage than was apparent externally,and the interior damage was &quot; terrific.&quot;According to a Petty Officer who was in the fore turret the 11-inch guns werenot out of action, but the main control was severed. He also stated that thereason for scuttling the ship was the fact that there were very few rounds ofammunition remaining for either 11-inch or 5-9-inch guns; but the correctnessof this statement is considered to be open to doubt.3. The Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs has confirmed the fact thatCaptain Langsdorff shot himself under the old Imperial German flag.According to the Naval Correspondent of the Prensa, the leading Argentinepaper, Captain Langsdorff&apos;s last letter, which was produced as confidentialevidence at the inquest, included praise for the British tactics, and a wholesheet of personal recrimination for his failure to appreciate the tactical situationowing to the volume of alarming reports regarding the state of his own ship which were reachinsr him. thus confusing his judgment.4. In her operations against shipping the Graf Spee made use of heraircraft, sometimes with British markings.5. During the visit of H.M.S. Achilles to Buenos Aires several groups ofA admiral Graf Spee men and A chilles men were seen talking amicably together,greatly to the amazement of the local inhabitants. Three of the German seamenwere observed to be saluting when A chilles colours were lowered at sunset.The British seamen were noticeably superior to the Germans in height andphysique; this was much commented upon.
