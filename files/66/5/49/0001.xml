THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT&apos; UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.l!0ST SECREQ?.COPY NO a   2fPWAR CABINET.ACTION IN NORWEGIAN TERRITORIAL WATERS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,I circulate to my colleagues i,n accordance with conclusion 1 (i) of W.M. 50 (40) k&quot;revised draft of theproposed statement by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the stoppage of traffic in Norwegian territorial waters.H.FOREIGN OFFICE.24th February, 1940.

The recent incident in connexion with the. &quot;Altmark&quot;has led His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom notonly to consider that incident in all its hearings hutalso to review the position arising from the methodsemployed by the German Government in the conduct of thewar at sea.It is evident from the case of the &quot;Altmark&quot; thatGermany is claiming the right for her warships to utiliselong stretches of neutral waters as a protected moans of access to or from the areas in which they carry out theirdepredations.      The use in this way of neutral waters which do not., form a normal route for shipping, with the soloobject of avoiding attack by the Allied Fleets, cannot boregarded as an exercise of the right of &quot;innocent passage&quot;which is reoognised by international law.His Majesty&apos;s Government could not acquiesce in such anextension of the doctrine of &quot;innocent passage&quot;,&quot;which seems to them in contradiction both of the spirit of the relevant international provisions and also of the plainequities involved.    There would for instance bo nothing to prevent Gorman ships which are using such a protectedcorridor from making a short raid into the high seas to capture or sink a British merchant ship, returning thereafter to the shelter of territorial waters, or from using thiscovered approach to the open seas, in order to pursue theirdepredations upon shipping, Allied and neutral alike.

Such a position., would appear to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto be frankly intolerable, and they cannot believe that either the provisions of international lav/ or any reasonableview of the issues involved would impose upon them the dutyof its acceptance.      Moreover, German insistence on theinviolability of neutral waters only applies when this isin their own interests, as is shown by the fact that theyhave not hesitated to destroy both British and neutral shipping in those waters.His Majesty&apos;s Government have felt bound to considerthe position not only from the point of view of what hasbeen said above but also in the light of the general conductby the enemy of warfare on the high seas.In recent weeks the German campaign against the merchantshipping of all nations has been, intensified and pursued witheven greater brutality than before.      The number of neutral ships destroyed by German action is now nearly 150, andthe number of neutral lives lost is over 1,000.     These attacks have been carried out in almost every case in defiance ofthe recognised rules of war, frequently in circumstances ofthe greatest barbarity, and on many occasions without there being the slightest justification for interference with theship.      Germany has announced that she regards herself asentitled, to destroy any neutral ship en route to any Britishport, including contraband control harbours, and there have,moreover, been a number of cases of vessels being destroyed on voyages between two neutral ports, when the vessel hadintention of touching at a British port at all.      It is

obvious that the German Government have now embarked onan indiscriminate campaign of destruction throughout the waters in which their unnotified mines are laid or theirsubmarines in a position to operate.While in recent weeks the greatest losses havefallen upon neutral shipping, British and Allied vesselshave also suffered from the adoption of this policy of destruction;    a new development of which is the bombingfrom the air of British trawlers and fishing boats and the machine-gunning of their crews.The innocent character of fishing boats has been recognised by the provision in Article 3 of the hague convention No. XI, which exempts vessels employed exclusivelyin coast fisheries from capture, but the fact that Germany-is a party to this provision has not prevented her fromcommitting nearly 200 .attacks on fishing vessels, aimed atsinking them and murdering their crews.     Even lightships,the object of which is  to protect shipping of all nations and which are by international usage treated as non-combatants,have been with their crews ruthlessly attacked by bombs.From the earliest times it has been recognised thatneutrals in time of war have the right to sail the seas andengage in trade with each other and to trade withbelligerents, subject to those rights of control recognised by international law.     Germany is denying these rights to neutrals by sinking their ships without warning and machine-gunning their seamen for the purpose of damaging Allied trade.Germany, is, in fact, seeking by methods wholly illegal andcruelly inhumane, including the murder of neutral seamen,

to prevent any ships reaching the Allied countries andto deter neutral seamen by fear of death from engaging in lawful trade with them.     At the same time, germany is obtaining the benefit of the protection accorded to ships in neutral territorial waters.     In other words,Germany is flagrantly violating neutral rights in orderto damage the Allied coxmtries while claiming that thenormal incidents of neutrality should be scrupulouslyrespected when this is of value to herself.International lav/ has always recognised the right ofthe belligerent when its enemy has systematically resortedto illegal practices to take action appropriate to thesituation create! by the illegalities of the enemy.      Suchaction., although not lawful in other circumstances, ismade and recognised as lawful in view of the otherbelligerent1s violation of law.     H.M. Government in theUnited Kingdom therefore hold themselves entitled to take such action as they may deem appropriate, including theprevention of the continued use by the enemy of terri-torial waters which are clearly of particular value tohim.     Needless to say no action that H.M. Government inthe United Kingdom may take will involve any disregard of the obligations of humanity.
