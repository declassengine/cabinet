P.(40)60.WAR    CABINET.Stoppage of traffic in Norwegian territorial waters,Memorandum by First Lord of the Admiralty.1. It has been very painful to watch during the lasttwo months the endless procession of German oreships down the Norwegian territorial waters carrying to Germany thematerial out of which will be made the shells to kill ouryoung men in 1941, when all the time the simplest and easiestof motions would bring it to an end.      The evident partialitywith which through fear the Norwegian authorities are using their neutrality&apos;in favour of Germany calls for redress.This partiality reached its climax in the attempt of theNorwegian Government and Naval Officers to curry favour withthe German   bully by smuggling the ALTMARK and her prisonerssafely into German hands.      The action which we have takenundoubtedly constitutes the most flagrant breach of neutrality of a, technical character which could &quot;be imagined.      Theplunge has been taken,  and taken with an enormous measureof world sympathy.2, Why then should we stop here?      Far from excusingourselves to Norwegian protests we should adopt.and pursue the policy of moral counter-attack initiated by-the foreign secretary in his conversations with tjhe Norwegian Minister.

We ran what seems to be a grave risk in defying the Norwegiantorpedo boat whose torpedo tubes were trained upon our ships.Personally I never had the slightest apprehension that theywould fire upon us on this occasion, but the risk of a clash with loss of Norwegian life had plainly to be faced,  and wasfaced by the Foreign Office and the Admiralty.      We do not want this kind of thing to go on.      At any time the attemptto pass German arms to the Russians to help them against the finns may force us to arrest another ship in norwegian territorial waters,&quot;     It may well be that under the furioushectoring of Berlin a Norwegian gun--boat will fire a shot,or far more dangerous,  a torpedo,  in which case a bloodyincident might occur, with every evil repercussion^ all overthe world.39 The simplest and surest way of avoiding all this is to lay a small declared minefield as originally proposed by the Admiralty at some point in norwegian territorial waters which will force enemy traffic into the open sea.      There are three or four such points,   and thereforeeven when very.-tardily one minefield has been swept up by theNorwegian Navy, we can declare others and also relay mines in the channel they have swept.      At no point in this processwould there be any danger of armed collision with Norwegianwarships which could not be discreetly avoided.      On theother hand the remedy   would be instantly effective and.would probably bring the whole traffic to an abrupt end.4. Now while we are justly indignant at the abuse of norwegian neutrality to which we have been subjected&apos; now isithe time to act.      Strike while the iron is hot.      In three days from the moment of sanction by the Cabinet the minefieldcan be laid.      This will also cover the imperative need which

will arise to close the ga.p when the &quot;big barrage is completed.5. Naturally,  such action must be  judged in its relation to the large/project.      Will it make it more likely that the Norwegians will refuse passage to our troops.    Ihave not the slightest doubt that it will improve ourprospeots(such as they are.      The Norwegians would loathecoming into  the war on the side of Germany.      If thereforethey realise that they are going to be forced to chose one side or the other,  and have no chance of stopping out, theyare far more likely to come down on our side than otherwise.If we allow them to continue under the delusion that mere wordsand protests will deter us from necessary action,  they willsupply these in an endless and copious flow.      At present itis perfectly certain they will refuse passage^but  if they feel in their bones that we are inflexibly resolved,   I personally believe the chances of their physical resistanceare remote or at least greatly reduced.      Therefore I believethat the larger prospect will be helped,  so far as it can be helped,  rather than hindered by the particular action required.6. But there Is always the chance that our arrestingthe ore traffic by a further breach of Norwegian neutralitywill stir the Germans into precipitate action.      They maycommit some overt act upon the soil of Norway.      This,  as theChancellor of the Exchequer has already pointed out,  wouldentitle us to regard Norway as a battlefield in which we shouldbe bound to fight for necessary positions.7* I should be glad therefore if Naval action, forwhich permission is req\iested,  acted as a provocation.      Atany rate it would be much better to try out the Norwegian

reaction and the German reaction upon a small operation whichwe can certainly achieve,  than run the risk,  which now; I I from the telegrams appears almost a certainty,  of our\ \ arriving with an Armadaiand having the door shut in ourfaces.8. Finally I do not hesitate to say that if the worst came to the worst and Norway and  Sweden joined Germanyand invited German  troops into their country to protect them,  a step which would he fatal to their independence and also extremely unpleasant for them at the time,  even so a state of war with Norway and Sweden would he more for our advantage than the present neutrality which givesall the advantages to Germany for nothing,   and imposes alldisadvantages  upon us.  Germany would then have to defendand victual the Scandinavian peninsula,  thus diverting herstrength and consuming her straitened supplies.      Our&quot;blockade would &quot;become far more effective,   and usingsea-power we could easily supply ourselves with varyingtemporary bases on the Norwegian coast.On all grounds therefore proximate and ultimate,particular and general,   I ask that the Navy shall he allowed to act forthwith in the sense requested.W. 3. 0.February,  1940.
