P* (40)59 , VaXsoGTO-S. (40)245(S). COPY NO.    f *war CABINET.SCANDINAVIA - ASSISTANCE TO FINLAND.THE TIME FACTOR.Joint Report hy the Foreign Officeand the chiefs of Staff Committee.The War Cabinet at its meeting^ on the 16th Februaryhad under consideration the question of assistance to finland.     As a result of the discussion on the time factor,they &quot;invited the Foreign Office and the Chiefs of Staff toexamine, in consultation, the inter-relationship ofthe diplomatic and military action,  and to report thereonto the War Cabinet as early as possible&quot;.      This report is rendered in pursuance of the above conclusion.MILITARY CQMS1DERATIONS.2. Dealing first with the purely military considerations,the earliest date on which we can land a force in Norwayis the 2GJth March.      To enable this to be done, storeships would have to sail on the 12th March, and personnel shipson the 15th March.      On the other hand, in order to make sure of getting established at Galivare and Lulea before theearliest known date on which the latter would be icefree^ wemust commence landing in Norway on the 3rd April at the latest.This means that the store ships would have to sail on the26th March and personnel on the 29th March.      If there was alate thaw,  it would be possible to put back these dates and still forestall the Germans at Lulea;   but   every  day&apos;s delay would mean a day lost in going to the help of the Finns.$   W.M.(40)43rd Conclusions, Minute 1(8).   .-1-

It will be seen from the above that the firstships of the expedition must sail on or between the 12th.March and the 26th March, both inclusive, but that thetroops themselves need not sail until 15th March and 29thMarch respectively..3* From the military point of view it is desirable thatthe expedition should sail on the earlier date, or as near aspossible afterwards,  for the following reasons:-(a) the longer period that we have for establishingourselves in Norway and Sweden, the better.(b) the sooner we land, the sooner cur helpwill reach the hard-pressed Finns.DIPLOMATIC CONSIDERATIONSo4, Turning now to the diplomatic aspect, thefollowing processes are involved:-(a) Obtaining Finnish agreement to allied intervention with regular forces.(b) The preparation of Scandinavian public opinion by an intensive propaganda campaign..(c) The issue of an appeal by Finland.(d) Persuading the Norwegian and Swedish governments to grant passage to our troops across their countriesApproach to the Finns..5. We cannot take it for granted that the Finns will necessarily agree to Allied intervention with regular forces,since this might involve them in war with Germany,  and theymight consider the extent of our proposed assistance to be inadequate to justify their taking this risk.    We thinkthat this doubt should be cleared up as soon as possible.-6. It will be recalled that on the 7th February, theWar Cabinet decided that an indication of our intentionsshould be &quot;conveyed to Field Marshal Mannerheim by BrigadierLing, who was shortly leaving for Finland&quot;  (see W.M.(40)35th Conclusions, Minute l(iii))o      On 12th February,

however? they reconsidered the matter and decided that in.view of the risk of leakage &quot;Brigadier Ling should he inpossession of full information about the projected Alliedmoves in Finland and Scandinavia, hut should not disclosethis to anyone until he received orders to do so&quot;,    (see.M0(40)39th Conclusions, Minute 6(a))e7* There are a number of reasons which make it desirable,that this communication should not he postponed any longer in the first place;  if wo do not take the Finns into our confidence, there is a danger that they may make an appealbefore we are ready to actn      Secondly,, there is a danger that,unless they are fortified by the prospect of Allied assistancethey may make a premature peace, and thus remove the grounds for our intervention in Scandinavian     Thirdly, it is clearly desirable that we should know exactly where we stand inthis matter as soon as possible,      If, for example, it isfound that the Finns will not agree to Allied regular forcesmoving to.their assistance through Norway and Sweden,  theSupreme War Council, will have to reconsider the conclusions which they reached on the 5th February,,8,.        We therefore recommend that Brigadier Ling shouldbe instructed to inform Field Marshal Mannerheim of our intentions immediately on his return to Finland, and toreport the Field Marshall reactions at once0Timings Proposed.,9o Assuming that the Finns agree to our proposals, thenext question to be determined is the timing of their appeal.It will be recalled that the Supreme War Council at its meeting on the 5th February decided &quot;that the diplomatic action should not be initiated until the military preparations, both for assistance to Finland? and for supporting Norway and Sweden,, if required, are ready inas&quot;every respect.5e   See draft record of S.WoC.5th. Mtg* ,page 27, conclusion 80-5-

10.       If we adhere literally to the above conclusion?the appeal cannot be issued until the 11th March...Since an instantaneous favourable response from norway and Sweden could hardly be expected, an appeal onthis date would come too late to enable our forces toland in Norway on 20th March,11.        On the other hand, if we were to arrange for the appeal to be made some considerable time before11th March, we would not be in a position to give theNorwegian and Swedish Governments an assurance of immediate support against Germany.     Moreover, itmust be recognised that- as soon as we approach theNorwegian and Swedish Governments, there is a riskof leakage to Germany, who? if we were not ready to act,might take immediate action to intimidate Sweden and norway and might well proceed to the occupation of strategic points in Scandinavia.      It is therefore acase of reconciling the diplomatic and military require-menta.12.       Assuming that Norway and Sweden are going to consent to give us passage, a week ought to be sufficientto ask for and to obtain this consent.     Thus, if the appeal were made on 5th March, the expedition oughten this assumption to be able to start on the idealdate,  i.e. 12th March.      On the other hand, evenif the Germans should hear of our approach to Norway and sweden on the 5th, this would not leave them much timeto find out our exact intentions, or to make arrangements to forestall us at the Norwegian peats, or otherwfee to jntbidateSweden and Norway.   Nevertheless; it would.be a wise pre caution /

to have the forces destined to seize Stavanger? Bergen ancLTrondheim ready to sail in warships directly the Finnsmake their appeals      The Admiralty and the War office are examining     whether this can &quot;be done.138       We therefore recommend that the time-tableshould be as follows :-rAs soon as possible - . An indication of our,intention to marshal mannerheim.The Finnish appeal,Forces for Stayanger,Bergen and Trondheimto be ready to sail,,if possible.Negotiations with Norway and Sweden.Date on which firstships of the expeditionshould sail.Date on which personnelships should sail.Last date on which it is safe to count for the sailingof the store ships of the expedition (vide para.2)Last date on which it is safe to count for the sailingof personnel ships (videpara*2)*Note,    The store ships could sail before the consent ofthe Norwegian and Swedish Governments had beenobtained, &quot;but there would clearly be grave objectionsto allowing the personnel ships to do so.14.       The above time-table rests on two assumptions:-(a) That our best chance of securing the consentof Norway and Sweden is by diplomatic negotiation;and(b) That the choice of time rests with us.Negotiations with Scandinavian Governments.15.       As regards (a)? it has been suggested thatpreliminary diplomatic negotiations would be unwisesand that a brusque ultimatum would be more likely to achieve our object.    It appears to us that;  in the5th March5th-12th March12th March15th March26th March29th March

present case, an ultimatum, unless we knew that it would beaccepted, could only be an empty threat.     If it were rejected,we should be unable to enforce it.     A land expedition is quite adifferent affair from naval action in Norwegian territorial waters, e.g. the case of the &apos;Altmark!,   when it was possible forus to bring superior force effectively to bear, and passive resistance on the part of the Norwegians was of no avail.      In thecase of a land expedition, however, even passive resistancewould be sufficient to prevent any movement of our forcesinland.      For example, the Scandinavians have only to cut offthe electric power and remove their rolling stock to paralysethe enterprise.      Even the lack of active co-operation would for some considerable time so greatly reduce the efficiency ofthe Scandinavian transportation system as seriously to prejudice the chances of our success.16. As regards the assumption in paragraph 14(b) above, thereis a possibility that the choice may not be crurs, and that our hands may be forced, either:a) by a sudden Finnish collapse,  orb) by the premature issue of an appeal by the finnish government, or(c) by unexpected developments in Sweden or Norway,  or(d) by German action.In that event, we could hot advance themilitary time-table, but it would be necessary immediately to approach the Norwegian and Swedish Governments for permission for our expedition to pass through their countries,  as soon asit was ready.The Finnish Appeal,17. It remains to consider the manner in which the Finnsshould make their appeal.     We suggest that a first approach should be made secretly through the diplomatic channel.     TheFinnish Government would call upon the British and french governments to send armed forces to their assistance, and, at thesame time, appeal to the Swedish and Norwegian Governments toallow these forces to cross their territory, as well as to furnishcontingents of their own.    This would give the Allied Governments ifcenecessary opening for asking the Swedish and Norwegian Governments

to allow their forces to pass through.     But, whi3e  theFinnish approach to Norway and Sweden would, in the firstinstance,. not he made public, it could be made quite clear to the Swedish and Norwegian Governments that,  should theyrefuse to co-operate,  its publication would inevitablyfollow?    - nd that their attitude would become known totheir own people, and to the world.      This procedure wouldhave the advantage of giving the Swedish and Norwegian Governments a short respite in which to consider their position, before having to make a public answer, andwould avoid the period of general uncertainty andconfusion which would be likely to follow a publicappeal.(Signed)       C.L.N. NEWALLDUDLEY POUNDH.R.S., MASSY (&quot;for the Chief ofthe Imperial1 General Staff).ORME SARGENT..richmond Terrace, S/&quot;.l,18th February, 1940.NOTEsSince the above report was drafted -(i)   &apos;7e have received a telegram from the Howard-VyseMission at General Game1in&apos;s Headquarters(see Annex I),and(ii)   We have seen Helsingfors telegram No.109 of the16th February (see Annex II).Both of these telegrams appear to u&amp; to emphasise the   .importance of the recommendation contained in paragraph 8 ofthis Report to the effect that Brigadier Ling should be instructed to inform Field Marshal Mannerheim of our intentionsimmediately on his return to Finland.     Brigadier Ling is dueto arrive at Helsingfors tomorrow afternoon, the 19th February,The telegram reproduced at Annex I also appears to us toemphasise the importance of informing the French Government,as soon as possible of any decisions which may be reached bythe ^ar Cabinet as a result of their consideration cf this report.General Gamelin has requested that the Chiefs of staff should accelerate their study of the possibility of (i)sending immediate assistance to Finland and (ii) acceleratingthe oespatch of main force.      The latter is, in the opinionof the Chiefs of Staff,  impossible.      The former is being given active consideration.

ANNEX II,HELSINGFORS TELEGRAM NO,  109,(Despatched 7.14 p.m. on16th February, 1.940),In my telegrams Nos e 81 and 9-5 attention was drawn to Finnish army&apos;s most urgent needs.      In concert with military Attache and Major Magill who has just returned from visit to Field Marshal at Headquarters I submitfollowing supplementary appreciation of situation.Finnish High Command are evidently feeling strain of continued Russian violent attack which has now lastedwithout pause for ever two weeks.     Finnish morale is stillgood but strain is intense.     High Command ask whetherthe Allies are (gp0 undec) regarding assistance toFinlando      In the circumstances we submit that early decision is essential and that assurance of early assistance would do much to help Finns through next six critical weeks after which help in man power must arrive if finnish resistance is not to collapse.2.       View is being expressed here that the attitude of sweden depends on the degree of firmness shown by the allies in assisting Finland0      Swedish circles here favourable tointervention are expressing the view that the despatch ofthree Swedish divisions to Finland and the possibleconsequent war with Russia would be preferable toactive Allied intervention by way of Norway and Sweden whichmight lead to a German attack.     The Swedish Minister in conversation with me yesterday stated that Sweden&apos;s first objective was to keep out of the European war and nextobjective &quot;i&apos;Q keep out of the Finnish one and I gatherthat Swedish Government had refused to sanction proposeddespatch of Swedish troops en masse (my telegram No. 74).We submit that the Swedish Government will commit themselvesto sending necessary divisions to Finland if, butonly if, His Majesty&apos;s Government first set example if relevantmilitary action-,
