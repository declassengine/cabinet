THIS,DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  February 1940.SECRET. Copy No.   lgW.P. (40) 55.(Also CCS. (40)241 ( ).)TO BE KEPT UNDER LOGK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.PROTECTION OF OSLO AGAINST AIR ATTACK.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.WE were invited by the War Cabinet on the 9th February to examine whether there were any steps that could be taken to provide protection to Oslo against air attack (W.M. (40) 37th Conclusions, Minute 5 (ii) (6)).2. There are no direct steps that can be taken to protect Oslo against air attack. That city is about the same distance from German air bases as is London,and a most devastating scale of air attack could be brought to bear on it. We canill spare from the defence of the United Kingdom and our sea-borne trade eventhe three fighter squadrons that we propose to send to Scandinavia. They willbe more than fully occupied in attempting to protect the base port and lines of communications of our forces in Scandinavia. We can make no additionalA.A. guns available for the protection of Oslo. Nor can we provide any balloonsfrom our own resources.3. In our report on intervention in Scandinavia, Plans and Implications(W.P. (4G) 35, paragraphs 14 and 15), we invited attention &quot; to the possibilityof making a public declaration in advance that if Germany &apos; took the gloves off &apos;and initiated bombing in Scandinavia that led to destruction of civilian life and property as she did in Poland, we should immediately retaliate on Germany.&quot;We suggested that an assurance of this kind might be demanded by the Swedesand Norwegians as an indispensable condition of their co-operation; and pointedout that the price we might have to pay for Norwegian and Swedish co-operationmight be the opening of unrestricted air warfare.4. This is the only form of deterrent we could provide to the unrestrictedbombing of Oslo.   Whether it would be effective or not only experience can prove.(Signed) DUDLEY POUND.H. R. S.
