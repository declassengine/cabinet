NAVAL SITUATION.Home Waters.Enemy air attacks on East Coast shipping were renewed on the 3rd february the extent of the damage to merchant ships is shown in Appendix II, only one small Norwegian ship was actually sunk. Three convoys were attacked without success; the escorting vessels, which included EE.MS. Cairo (A.A. cruiser),engaged the enemy aircraft and drove them off. Three Ffeinkels were shot downby our fighters and another was damaged.2. On the same day H.M. minesweeper Sphinx (senior officer of the 5thMinesweeping Flotilla) was bombed 15 miles North of Kinnaird Head, sustainingconsiderable damage and the loss of the Commanding Officer and four ratings.The ship was taken in tow but eventually capsized in a heavy sea; two officers and44 men were rescued by H.M.S. Boreas (who damaged her bows when going along-side H.M.S. Sphinx), but 4 officers and 45 men lost their lives. The wreck is nowashore off Lybster. Attacks were also made on 4 of FI.M. Trawlers, the Reboundoand Willow off the Tyne and Yarmouth respectively, and the Arctic Explorer andHugh Walpole off the Orkneys.  One officer and one rating were wounded.3. The third Canadian Troop Convoy, escorted by H.M.S. Malaya, IT.M.S.Valiant and 13 destroyers, arrived in the Clyde on the 7th February.H.M.S. Southampton has been engaged since the 4th February in a searchoff the Norwegian Coast for two enemy ships believed to be carrying munitionsfrom Germany to Murmansk. A flying boat has been assisting her in this opera-tion.  Southampton is to be relieved in order that this search can be continued.4. The Minelayer Princess Victoria carried out a minelaying operation onthe night of the 6th-7th February in the East Coast mine barrage to the eastwardof Kinnaird Flead.During the night of the 4th-5th February, French destroyers swept up theDutch Coast as far as the Hook of Holland, preparatory to a French minelayingoperation in the Straits of Dover.5. On the 3rd February an explosion occurred in the minesweeping trawlerFirefly as a result of the detonation of a mine which was being recovered in the firth of Forth. One lieutenant R.N.Y.R., three sub-lieutenants R.N.V.R. and six or more ratings were killed. One lieutenant R.N.V.R. and four ratings werewounded.   She was subsequently towed into Leith.On the 7th February in a dense fog the British cable ship Alert rammedand sank the French patrol vessel Veteran off Cape Griz Nez. There were no casualties.Foreign Waters.6. H.M.S. Comorin (Armed Merchant Cruiser) has taken ten germans from the Portuguese S.S. Nyassa (8,980 tons), outward bound from Lobito. ThePortuguese S.S. Colonial (8,309 tons) was stopped off Freetown on the7th February by H.M.S. Albatross, and six Germans were removed. TheAlbatross was assisted by aircraft operated from Freetown.Naval Casualties.7.

German intelligence.8 No intelligence was obtained from aircraft reconnaissance during the lastweek. The following is considered to be the probable distribution of the principalGerman naval units : Scharnhorst at Brunsbuttel until the 8th February.Gneisenau was at Wilhelmshaven on the 3rd February.Lutzow (ex Deutschland), Admiral Scheer and Hipper were reported as having left Kiel on the 25th January for North Sea ports.Prince Eugene, with the Blucher in company, is carrying out trials in theBaltic.  It is reported they will stay there until the 25th February.The cruisers Emden and Karlsruhe were reported to be in the Baltic on the4th February. . ,   .    ,   ...   al the cruisers Nuremburg, Koln and Liepzig were reported to be m the JNortnSea area on the 4th February.Protection of Seaborne Trade.9. Four hundred and ten ships, including 13 Allied and 47 Neutral, havebeen convoyed during the week. Included in this number are three ocean convoysfrom Halifax, Sierra Leone and Gibraltar, comprising altogether 100 ships,which have arrived safely at United Kingdom ports.Only one ship in an escorted convoy, the British S.S. Beaverburn, was lost.She was torpedoed 150 miles W.S.W. of the Scilly Islands outward bound, andshortly afterwards the escorting destroyer delivered a promising attack on theU-boat in question.One homeward Norwegian convoy, consisting of 29 neutral ships with ore and cellulose, arrived without incident.Shipping on the East Coast has been hampered by fog, but in spite of adverse weather conditions and attacks by enemy aircraft, nearly 200 ships have beenconvoyed up and down the coast from Orfordness to Methil without mishap.Thirty-two destroyers and 15 escort vessels have been employed on escort duties, in addition to one battleship, one cruiser and eight armed merchant cruisers for ocean escorts.Of the 8,000 ships convoyed since the beginning of the war, only 16 Britishand 2 Neutrals have been lost.Arming of &quot; deep sea &quot; British merchant ships is now 77 per cent, complete,and it is expected that all vessels of over 2,000 gross tons trading to the UnitedKingdom will be armed by the end of April 1940.East coast shipping situation.10. A number of factors, mostly of recent date, have necessitated recon-sideration of arrangements for the safety of merchant shipping, both Allied and neutral, on the East Coast of the United Kingdom. Briefly, these may besummarised as follows : (a) The growing tendency for neutral vessels to take advantage of ourconvoys.(b) The fact that two neutral vessels were torpedoed off the Fame Islandswhile proceeding independently between Methil and the Tyne on the25th January.(c) The recent air attacks on East Coast shipping.11. Within the last week the following revised arrangements have beenbrought into force : (a) Daily, convoys between the Tyne and Southend as before but rather more frequently, that is on 21 days out of 25. It is intended to run convoysevery day as soon as escorts become available. Escorts for these convoys to consist of two escort vessels or destroyers, and a covering. force of one or more A.A. vessels and J-class destroyers to be in thevicinity of convoys during their daylight passage between Whitbyand Cromer.(b) Convoys have been reinstituted between Methil and the Tyne on thesame frequency as between the Tyne and Southend. Escorts for these convoys will consist of four trawlers and two escort vessels ordestroyers.[20777] B 2
[V-,: (c) All vessels not in convoy to sail in groups, at present unescorted-until. trawler escorts become available.\ . - .(d) Ships sailing out of convoy in daylight to. be within prescribed areas where air escort and protection will be provided. This arrangementhas been made with a view to limiting the area in which it is necessaryfor the Royal Air Force to afford air protection,while the groupsailing will further facilitate location and protection by fighter aircraft. - - . .(e) All northbound shipping from the Firth of Forth to be sailed at dusk soas to make as much northing as possible in dark hours, and all vesselscapable of inclusion in convoy to sail in Outward Norwegian convoys.(/) Improved arrangements for communicating distress messages to fighter and Coastal Command groups.It is intended, as soon as trawler escorts are available, to institute daily slowconvoys both ways between Humber and Southend, and later to provide trawlerescort during daylight hours between Humber and Tyne.12. There are in all about 320 ships between 500 and 2,000 gross tons on theEast Coast at sea and in harbour on a given day. Of these, 90 are already armed with a 12-pdr. and 16 others are now in hand for arming. In order to completeremaining ships in this class with minimum delay, urgent action has been taken through the Ministry of Shipping with the Area Committees at the ports to layup these ships in rotation for arming as quickly as possible, and it is expectedthat all vessels of over 500 gross tons trading regularly on the East Coast willhave a 12-pclr. gun mounted by the end of March.13. A pool of 120 Lewis guns manned by naval personnel is established onthe East Coast. These men are detailed for ships trading regularly between portsfrom the Firth of Forth to London. In certain cases they are retained in shipsproceeding onwards to the North of France and Channel ports. These equip-ments are moved from ship to ship as circumstances require. One hundredadditional Lewis guns will be distributed in the immediate future for other vesselssailing on the East Coast not hitherto provided for. These guns will be manned by merchant navy personnel as naval ratings are not available.14. Schermuley rockets are being distributed to East Coast ports now for supply to merchant ships and fishing vessels generally. Trials have recently beencarried out at Portsmouth with a lethal head which is to be attached to theserockets.  The result of these trials is not yet known.Approval is being given for the purchase of a further 20,000 Schermuleyrockets, and a high degree of priority is being given to other and more effectiveweapons for defence against low-bombing and machine-gun attacks.15. Shipowners have already been given detailed advice concerning theprotection of helmsmen, look-outs and other exposed personnel from machinegunfire. The majority of ships have already fitted some kind of protection, e.g.,sand bags. Other and more effective means of protection, such as steel pill boxesand concrete blocks, have been recommended and immediate action is now beingtaken through the Ministry of Shipping to ensure that all ships in an area subject-to air attack are provided with some adequate means of protection of this kind.16. Forty-five trawlers have already been armed with 12-pdrs., and 8 others have been selected for similar armament. Of the 450 trawlers operating in theNorth Sea, Lewis guns have been distributed for all except about 38. Approximately 300 additional Lewis guns will be required for the drifter fleet in Aprilwhen fishing is due to start. Training of fishing personnel in the use of theseguns is in progress at fishing ports on the East Coast and is being received with enthusiasm by the men concerned.Anti-submarine Operations.17. Five or six U-Boats have been operating during the past week, thelatest reports of their positions being off the Portuguese and Spanish coast, inthe Bay of Biscay, in the Western Approaches, to the northward of Scotland andin the Moray Firth.
Three promising attacks were carried out on U-Boats in the1 western approaches; on the 1st February by H.M.S. Veteran and H.M.S. Vesper, onthe 2nd February by H.M.S. Viscount and H.M.S. Wren when escorting ahomeward-bound Sierra Leone convoy, and on the 2nd February by H.M.S.Antelope on the U-Boat which had previously sunk s.s. Beaverburn while in an outward-bound Atlantic convoy. It is now thought probable that two U-boats were destroyed on the latter occasion.Among other attacks carried out during the week, one was made by a patrolaircraft on the 7th February on a U-Boat 30 miles N.N.E. of Gape Wrath.Bombs were dropped, but without visible result.German Attack on Seaborne Trade.18. During the week three British and three neutral ships were attacked by U-Boats, and one British, one French and two neutral ships were mined.The British s.s. A mble, which was damaged by mine on the 16th December,and s.s. Protesilaus, which was beached after striking a mine on the 21st January,are now to be broken up. They are, therefore, included in mercantile losses shownin Appendix IV. Tonnage statistics are shown at the bottom of Appendices Iand II. Total tonnage British, Allied and neutral lost through enemy actionduring the week was 41,631, of which 26,799 was British.The following ships are overdue : Swedish : Sylvia left Hull 9/1 for Gothenburg.Belgian : Meuse left Tyne 15/1 for Bruges.British : Trawler Neivhaven last reported 14/1.British : Quiberon left Downs 19/1 for Boston, Lines.Norwegian :   Varild left Norway 22/1 for England.Norwegian : Segovia left Oporto 17/1 for Oslo.British : Ampleforth left Milford Haven 8/1 for Hampton Roads.German Minelaying.19. Three mines were cut by minesweepers in the War Channel north ofBlyth, and one off the Tyne on the 2nd February. On the same day reports fromScapa indicated that an unknown ship had been mined or torpedoed two miles south of Auskerry (east Orkneys) and, in consequence, the eastern entrance toKirkwall was closed to shipping. Floating mines were reported off St. IvesHead (north Cornwall) and in the south-west corner of Carmarthen Bay.Ten floating mines were reported off the Thames Estuary on the4th February. Enemy aircraft, very possibly minelaying, were reported to the eastward of Cromer, in the Would, during the atternoon of the 6th February,A magnetic mine was exploded on the 7th inst. off the mouth of the Tay close tothe position where the.Estonian s.s. Anu sank. The port of Dundee has been closed.British Mine-Sweeping.20. Bad weather a.ncl fog have hampered and, in some areas entirelyprevented, mine-sweeping during the last week. For this reason the approach to Cromarty, which was closed on the 26th January, and the eastern approach to Kirkwall, which was closed on the 2nd February due to the suspected laying of enemy mines, have not yet been re-opened. A thorough sweep of Scapa Flowand its approaches continues.21. H.M.S. Borde has not yet been able to continue her search of thechannel in the vicinity of the Sunk Light Vessel. It is proposed to increase her anti-aircraft armament to make her independent of air escort. The presentconversion programme provides for 12 vessels of the Borde type. experimental work with the double &quot; L sweep, and with aeroplanes carrying magnetic coilshas again been held up by the weather.Up to the present 62 of H.M. Ships have been de-magnetised and a further190 are in hand, while 15 merchant ships have been treated and 106 are in hand,ft is anticipated that every important ship will have been de-magnetised within six months.
More ships are being fitted out for mine recovery duties, and these willprobably be sent to a known enemy minefield in the River Tay estuary.Three new minesweeping vessels have been brought into commission duringthe week, bringing the total of vessels employed in. this work to 370.British Contraband Control.22. During the week 3,437 tons of cargo were seized in prize. The main items were 766 tons of metals, including 290 tons of copper and copper cathodes,1,683 tons of food products, 185 tons of cotton, 330 tons of rubber and 470 tonsof wood and paper.On the 6th February there were 30 neutral ships in the three contraband control bases in the United Kingdom, of which 21 had been detained for 5 days or less.German Merchant Shipping.23. German ships in Spanish ports continue to display considerable activity.Among those which show signs of impending departure are the Arucas (3,369tons), Antarktis (10,500 tons), Hundsek (1,456 tons), Wangoni (7,848 tons),Wahehe (4,709 tons), Rostock (2,542 tons) and Morea (1,927 tons). The followingships are at sea from South America and should now be nearing home waters :-Bahia (4,117 tons) sailed from Bahia on the 5th January.Sao Paulo (4,977 tons) sailed from Cabedello on the 9th January.Santos (5,943 tons) sailed from Rio de Janeiro on the 14th January.Consul Horn (7,772 tons) sailed from Aruba on the 9th January.Three ships have just sailed. The Wolfsburg (6,210 tons) sailed fromPernambuco on the 2nd February, La Coruna (7,414 tons) sailed from Rio deJaneiro on the 3rd February and the Konigsberg (6,466 tons) sailed from Paraon the 8th February. During the night of the 23rd January a large Germanship was reported to have passed Oslo Fjord loaded with guns and ammunition for Murmansk, and later two ships of 11,000 tons, similarly loaded, were reported at Helsingborg, where difficulty was experienced by the refusal of Swedish pilotsto take them to Stronstadt and of Norwegian pilots to meet them there.A large loaded German ship was reported off the coast near Arendal boundnorthward on the night of the 26th January. It is reported that on the6th February all German ships in Norwegian waters were examined by theNorwegian authorities In view of the rumours that munitions were being trans-ported to Murmansk, but no war material was found.General review of Fleet Air Arm work since the beginning of the war.24. During the early period of the war the aircraft carriers Courageousand Hermes were employed on anti-submarine patrols in the Western Approaches,and the Ark Royal was likewise employed on anti-submarine patrols far to thewest of the Hebrides in an area which extended beyond the range of shore-baseaircraft. It was during this period that the TJ-39 was sunk by destroyersoperating in company with the A rk Royal, and on two occasions submarines wareattacked by the Ark Royal&apos;s aircraft.The work of the aircraft from the Courageous and Hermes played abig part in ensuring the safety of British merchant shipping in the early days ofthe war, before the convoy system could be instituted. During this period theR.A.F. were fully occupied in the North Sea area and had insufficient long-rangeflying boats available to extend their air patrols far out in the western approaches.25. It is now well known that the aircraft from the Ajax played animportant part in spotting for gunfire in the River Plate battle.Two Fleet Air Arm fighter squadrons are now based on shore for the defenceof the Orkneys.
The following statistics on the work of the Carriers during the first four months of the war are of interest: Carrier.EagleGloriousAlbatross   ...HermesFurious (a)...Ark Royal ...No, of Sword-fish aircraftborne.18366(Walrus)1118Area employed.Eastern Indian OceanWestern Indian OceanFreetown  ...Off Dakar......OffPIalifaxj 42 while in Home Fleet (6 weeks) ...I 24 while in South Atlantic (14 weeks)Squaremilessearched.1,019,010897,540070,000500,000180,7504,250,000Note.

There have been no important movements during the week and operations have been restricted to patrolling. Unfavourable weather conditions have made air reconnaissance virtually impossible. On the Saar front, the15th Infantry Brigade has been relieved by the 8th Infantry Brigade.Germany.27. The distribution of German divisions shows little change and isbelieved to be :  Area.                                              Armd. Lt. Mtn.          Inf.

Reports indicate a slow, but definite deterioration in internal conditions. Food queues are of common occurrence in the principal cities. all available evidence points, however, to the conclusion that adequate supplies ofstaple food-stuffs are available, and shortages must, presumably, be attributed tofailures in the transportation system. These failures are likely to become more serious if the Finnish war continues, since the withdrawal of skilled labour fromfactories and repair shops will be increasingly felt. There is no evidence tosuggest that the regime is likely to be endangered unless difficulties increase considerably and continue for many months.29. Some further evidence of Soviet-German military collaboration hasbecome available, though there is no confirmation of reports that Germaninstructors have been sent to the Red Army. Reliable reports state that german ships have been carrying war material to Murmansk, and others confirm thepresence of small German forces in the Western Ukraine and suggest thatGermany has obtained a concession in the Drohobycz area. It seems possible that russia has granted this concession in return for German technical and material assistance.30. The Soviet press has lately given considerable publicity to the allegedplans of the Allies for an attack on Soviet territory in the Black Sea area, andespecially the Caucasus. Previous reports indicated that the fortifications ofSaturn and Odessa were being strengthened. According to a recent andiinconlirmed report, work is in progress on the defences of Sevastopol and Tuapse,where large quantities of German war material are said to be arriving.
Scandinavia.31. The mobilisation of the Swedish Army appears to be about three-quarters completed. It is thought that the Army has been divided into two army corps, one in the north and one in the south. This organisation may have beenadopted to meet the possibility of a war on two fronts. The Northern army corps is almost mobilised, and is reported to have a strength of 72,000 men. the mobilisation of the Southern Corps is in progress; it will only be some 25,000strong, considerably weaker than the Northern Corps.There is no official information of the mobilisation of the Norwegian Army.Reports state that reinforcements are being sent to the northern districts, aridthat a headquarters is being established at Tromso.Italy.32. According to the press, Signor Mussolini continues to receive periodical reports on Italian preparedness for war. In an interview at the end of January,he was informed of the state of frontier defences, and it seems from the presenceof the Chief Engineer of the Ivth  Corps (Bolzano) that the frontier defencesagainst Germany may have been under discussion. A press statement referred tothe &quot; advanced stage reached in the defence works on metropolitan territory.&apos;&apos;At another conference Signor Mussolini gave instructions for anti-aircraftweapons to be increased and for anti-aircraft militia personnel to be called up fortraining.It is reported that the Italian War Ministry has produced an extensivearmament programme to make good deficiencies revealed after the outbreak ofwar, but that the proposals have proved to be too ambitious in Italy&apos;s present economic condition. The 1940-41 estimates do not indicate that any extensivescheme of rearmament is likely to be financed in the near future, even if additional funds are provided from the extraordinary budget.33. The rumour, emanating from Libya, of the impending return of someformations to Italy has found some corroboration from an independent sourcein Italy, but so far the movements of drafts and supplies do not show that thegarrison is being reduced.Spanish Morocco.34. Reports indicate that trouble is expected from the Moors in the SpanishProtectorate. During the Civil War Colonel Beigbeder, then High Commis-sioner, pursued a very benevolent policy towards the Moors and distributed lavishsubsidies amongst their leaders with a view to keeping them friendly to theNationalist cause. The present High Commissioner, General Asensio, is, however,not disposed to give the Moors the same latitude and is introducing many irksomerestrictions, besides discontinuing the subsidies.AIR SITUATION.Royal Air Force Operations.Bomber Command.35. Weather conditions during the week brought operations almost to ;sstandstill. Many of the aerodromes were unserviceable owing to the bad state ofthe ground. The only operation which Bomber Command have undertaken is as weep by six Wellingtons on the 1st February in the Western part of the north sea. Visibility was extremely bad, and nothing of particular interest was seen.Fighter Command.36. Adverse weather conditions generally restricted air operations duringthe week. On the 3rd February, however, the German Air Force made a seriesof widespread attacks on East Coast shipping, and several fighter patrols were despatched. South of the Wash visibility was limited to 500 yards, and therewere continual showers of snow and sleet, but, further north, flying conditions were better, and our fighters were able to operate more successfully. Six enemy aircraft were sighted, and of these, three (all Heinkel 111) were shot down (one on land near Whitby and two in the sea off Tynemouth and north of Blythrespectively) and a fourth wTas severely damaged.
37. On the 2nd February a single meteorological reconnaissance aircraft was seen by fighters off the Norfolk Coast, but when our aircraft approached to within 1 mile it dived into the clouds and disappeared.Unidentified aircraft were plotted off the Norfolk Coast on the 6th February,but no fighter patrols could be despatched as all aerodromes were fogbound.A total of 141 patrols were despatched during the week, involving247 aircraft. These patrols were engaged almost entirely on shipping protectionduties.Coastal Command.38. 69 patrols were flown during the week, and 37 convoys were provided with air escorts. Three enemy submarines wei&apos;e sighted and two attacksmade. On the 2nd February a Hudson dropped two 250-lb. bombs on a submarine112 miles east of Duncansby Flead, and on the 7th February ah Anson on patrol33 miles north-north-east of Cape Wrath dropped two 100-lb. bombs with delayedfuse ahead of the wash of a submerged enemy submarine. There were no apparentresults from either attack. The Anson aircraft on the same flight saw a secondenemy submarine 50 miles north of the Butt of Lewis, but was unable to attackbecause it had already released its bombs.39. Enemy aircraft were sighted on various occasions, and on the3rd February an Anson engaged one of three Heinkel lll&apos;s attacking a british merchant Ship. After inconclusive combat the enemy aircraft disappeared intoclouds. A second Heinkel then attacked the Anson and fired a few bursts before it also disapeared.   The Anson sustained no damage.40. On the 2nd February aircraft with the East Coast convoy sighted twomines close ahead of the convoy and pointed them out to accompanying destroyers,which sank them.The attacks on shipping have increased the responsibilities of coastal command in rescue work as well as defence, special patrols being despatched to search for survivors of ships which had been sunk. On the 2nd February a raftwith seven men was seen by an Anson operating from Wick. The aircraft stoodby the raft until two armed trawlers arrived and rescued the men. On the3rd February another Anson directed a fishing smack to a ship&apos;s life-boat offFlamborough Head, and nine men were rescued.Operations in France.Royal A ir Force.41. There were no air operations of interest during the week, owing toadverse weather conditions. Leaflet carrying balloons were released over germany from the Western Front with a favourable wind on the nights of the 1st and2nd February, and 135,000 leaflets were distributed. If conditions remainedconstant, the areas of distribution would include Nuremburg, Wei den. Magdeburgand Munich.French Air Force.42. French air operations were almost entirely restricted to the 3rdFebruary when a few fighter sorties were made without encountering the enemy.German Air Activity.Attacks on North Sea Shipping.43. There was little enemy activity in the North Sea during the week except on the 3rd February when advantage was again taken of bad visibility to carryout an extensive raid on East Coast Shipping. Enemy aircraft acted singlyor in pairs, at widely divergent points. Incendiary bombs have been much used,and the number of high explosive bombs dropped by single aircraft suggeststhat they are of a light type, suitable for attack on unarmoured vessels. Althoughthe raids of the 3rd February were on a larger scale than anything which hadpreceded them, it is clear that the German Command is still pursuing a policy of limited liability, making attacks only under favourable conditions and conservingaircraft, oil and personnel so far as possible.[207771
Foreign Air Intelligence.44. Japanese naval aircraft bombed the Hanoi-Kunming railway on the 1stand on the 3rd February. On the 1st a train was hit and wrecked, and it isestimated that repair to the railway will take one month. About 150 casualtiesoccurred among the passengers in the train, including five French killed. this railway is a French undertaking of international interest. A previous bombing attack on the same line was reported in paragraph 33 of Resume No. 20, and itwould appear that the Japanese are attempting to deny the use of this line to theChinese. The military value of the Hanoi-Kunming line lies in its importance asan import route for war material and particularly for liquid oil, of which china is already short.45. It is understood that many Japanese aircraft are now stationed in and around the Island of Jalvit (Marshall Islands), and that large oil storage tanksare under construction in this group of islands.RUSSO-FINNISH HOSTILITIES.46. It is now learnt through a reliable source that the Soviet submarinepreviously reported to have been sunk by a mine on Christmas Day was S. 2,one of the new modern submarines of 900 tons. According to Finnish broadcasts,considerable damage was done on the 1st February to Soviet warships and ship-yards during an air raid on Kronstadt. Finnish planes, after a reconnaissanceflight on the following day, reported that fires were still burning. A press reportstates that the Swedish steamer Wirgo, 657 tons, was sunk on the 6th Februaryby Russian bombers near Mariehamn capital of the Aland Islands. She was in company with five other ships en route from Turku to Stockholm.47. As a result of the measures taken against Soviet naval action it is nowimpossible to obtain safe access to the Gulf of Bothnia without the services ofa minefields pilot. The channel is patrolled and narrow and can be covered by gunfire. Guns are mounted on the Swedish mainland, and the Swedes haveloaned field guns to the Finns to act as mobile armament. These have beenmounted temporarily, and a Finnish commission is now in Stockholm negotiatingfor naval guns to improve the anti-aircraft land defences.48. The week has seen hard fighting on both sides of Lake Ladoga andrenewed activity elsewhere; there have, however, been no major developments,though the Finns have gained a considerable local success on the north shore of lake Ladoga.49. The fighting on the Karelian Isthmus has been particularly severe. Onthe 1st February the Red Army attacked with two divisions and a large numberof tanks, in an effort to break through in the Summa sector. This attack-penetrated the Finnish position, but the Red troops were later ejected. since then the Red Army has maintained a steady succession of smaller attacks in thesame sector. These tactics appear to be designed to exhaust the Finns and toobtain an eventual break-through by cumulative effect. Though very expensivein men and material, they must, to some extent, be achieving their object. the handling of the Soviet troops shows some improvement over former standards.50. North of Lake Ladoga, the Soviet drive to relieve the sorely-tried forcein the Kitela area was held east of Loimola. Finnish operations developedsatisfactorily and by the 4th February the Finns had dispersed the greater partof the force and captured much war material. The Russian force at Kitelaoriginally comprised two divisions, but it is possible that some part of it success-fully made good its retreat and it seems unlikely that more than one Sovietdivision was heavily involved. Pressure on the Mannerheim line may force the finns to divert troops from this sector and render further exploitation of theirsuccess difficult.51. The Soviet 54th Infantry Division, in the Kuhmoniemi area, is in some difficulty and is being supplied chiefly by air. Soviet troops in the Suomussahniand Salla sectors are attacking, but the Finns appear to be holding them without difficulty. An interesting item of news is that the Russians now say that the finns have a 14-mm. anti-tank gun which will penetrate any tank.52. The Soviet Air Force has been very active in attacks both on Finnishtroops and on the civil population and there are indications that they have markeddown a number of towns for systematic destruction. On the Karelian IsthmusRussian aircraft have bombed and machine-gunned Finnish troops by night, forthe first time.
