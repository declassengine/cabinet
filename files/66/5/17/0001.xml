Three reconnaissance sweeps have been carried out in theWestern North Sea, by nine aircraft on 23rd January, by eighteenon the 25th, and by nine on the 26thc      These reconnaissanceshave all been carried through successfully in extremely badconditions;    visibility was poor throughout and nothing ofinterest was seenc2o        On 26th january   a force of twenty-four bomber aircraft was moved to Kinloss and Lossiemouth, and has been standing by tocover a possible naval operation in the Northern part of theNorth SeacFighter Commanda3.       There has been slight enemy activity over the western north Sea on almost every day during the week-     This activityappears to have been connected with long-distance reconnaissanceor meteorological flights,  and apart from the abortive raid on the shetlands on 24th January which is referred to in para.6, no enemy aircraft crossed the coast,.      Snow and fog made interception verydifficult, and though the usual standing patrols were maintainedneither they nor special patrols sent up to investigate unidentifiedaircraft made contact with the enemy.      On the 24th fighter aircraft on Channel escort duty detected a floating mine five miles off Dover, and guided a destroyer to the spot,,4.       The total number of patrols during the week was 177,involving 434 aircraft.      This is slightly lower than the figuresfor the previous week,  and much below that of the week from/7th

7th - 14th January,,  during which there were widespread enemy attacks on shippingcrioastal Commando5.        Though only one U-boat has actually been sighted by aircraft of Coastal Command, there have again been considerablesigns of submarine activity during the week.      On 22nd January,a U-boat was seen submerging by a light aircraft of the Commandoff the Aberdeenshire coast,  and on the 23rd another submarine was seen in the Bristol Channel by aircraft of Training Commandja search was instituted by Coastal Command* but could notre-establish contact.      On the same day an aircraft on convoyduty was detached in search of a suspected, submarine off theSouth coast of Ireland;  and on the 26th there was a specialsearch for a submarine attacked by Polish destroyers twenty miles off Lowestoftc      Special patrols were also sent out to search for survivors of the Swedish ship &quot;Gothia&apos;1   and the Norwegianship &quot;Faroe&quot; on the 26th and 28th, but so far without success.6,        On 24th Januany, German aircraft were reported overthe Shetlands.      Pour bombs were aimed at  the S0Sn   &quot;BaronRuthven&quot; some ten miles off shore, a trawler was attacked,  and four bombs were dropped on waste land not far from Lerwick,Prom the fragments,  these appear to have been of an armour-piercing type.      No damage was caused.7o        On the same day eight trawlers with Danish markingswere seen by a routine patrol some 40 miles off the Humbersteaming in formation and apparently clear- of fishing gear.So       Weather conditions have naturally handicapped operations during the week,  and patrols have been somewhat reduced while on22nd January an attempt to establish contact with H.M.   Submarine&quot;Triton&quot; in the Lister Fjord had to be broken off because of/ snow

Apart from the usual fighter patrols,   the operations ofthe Advanced Air Striking Force have also been on a reduced scale*On the 25th three fighters intercepted and attacked a Heinkel 111In the Stenay area, but the engagement was inconclusive.Overseas Commands.11.       The usual convoy and anti-submarine patrols were maintained during the week, but there is nothing of special interest to report,INTELLIGENCE.German Activity,,12.       Meteorological flights, which probably also serve thepurposes of general reconnaissances  have been maintained withsome regularity over the North Sea,  and have on occasion comefairly close to the English coasta      There was an ineffective raidon the Shetlands probably by a single aircraSt on 24th January,  anda. trawler is reported to have been bombed and machine-gunned 100miles East of the Humber on the same day.,      It replied with riflefire and claims to have hit the attacker.      There have been no reports of minelaying by aircraft during the week a     Activitjr in -the interior of Germany has also been much r educed, presumably by weather conditions,  except on 25th and 26th January,

13; The only enemy loss confirmed during the week to21st January was one Messerschmitt 109 shot down &quot;by Frenchfighters.French Air Activity.14.    Activity during the week was restricted almostentirely to 25th January and the following night.      Most ofthe 108 fighter sorties recorded during the week were madeon that day, and three photographic and visual reconnaissancepatrols were carried through on the Saar front,      A fourthpatrol was attacked at 34,000 feet by twelve enemy aircraft,but the temperature was so low as to prevent firing on either side.      On the following night there were two reconnaissancemissions;  one followed the route Ehrang-Coblenz-Wiesbaden-Ereuznach-Durkheim, dropping leaflets in Goblenz and Wiesbaden,the other flew over Trier-Bonn-Frankfurt-Mannheim.The Russo-Finnish War.15.    The renewed Russian attacks on the Isthmus fronthave been closely supported by aircraft;    266 bombers and 33fighters are said to have been employed against the Finnishposition, but the attacks appear for the present to haveslackened somewhat.      There are fewer reports of raids behind the lines, althotxgh damage to military hospitals is reported on two occasions.      Aircraft have been used for supplying troopsisolated in the Salla sector, and there has been some activity on the Petsamo front which has resulted in three forced landingsof Russian aircraft.      The Finns claim to have brought downtwenty-one out of twenty-four aircraft operating from Estoniaon the 22nd, 23rd and 24th January.16.    Russian bomber tactics do not appear to conform toany single standard practice.      Raids have been carried out byformations of all sizes, from two or three to thirty-two,operating in four formations of eight,      A gliding approach is sometimes made from 9,000 or 10,000 feet, to release the bombs/at

A Memorandum, dealing with the use of coloured search-light beams in Germany,  is appended.      This subject was dis-cussed at the 67th Meeting of the War Cabinet on 1st November,1939.NOTE OF TH1: EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED SEARCHLIGHTBEAKB BY GERMANY.1.      The question of the employment of coloured search-light beams has been the subject of continuous detailed studyby the Royal Engineer Searchlight Board for some years.      Tnegeneral conclusion reached by this body is that little advan-tage in point of penetration of haze or cloud or increase inillumination is achieved by the employment of coloured beams.Certain tactical advantages might accrue from the employmentof infra-red beams, since the pilot of an aircraft would beunaware that he was being observed and would therefore not takeavoiding action.      It is considered, however,  that the advantages which might be derived from the development of such a search-light do not compare with the results which are expected to be/obtained at about 1,500 feet,  flying level, but true dive-bombing is notpractised.      As a result of heavy losses, orders have now beenissued forbidding the bombing of towns from less than 10,000feet or of troops from less than 3,000 feet.17.    There are no new reports of Finnish air activity sincethe raids of the 20th on Kronstadt and Baltiski in which Italianpilots are said to have taken part.      It is reported that ashipment of thirty French single seater fighter aircraft will leave shortly for Bergen en route for Finland, and that theAmerican government has agreed to release fort3J of the fifty-four Brewster fighters ordered by the Finns in America.      Thefirst sis were due to leave for Finland on 29th December, andthe remaining thirty-four were promised for shipment during january.      One civil aircraft has been bought in Holland witha view to improving communications with Sweden.

obtained from new developments in R.D.P.2,      The Committee for the Scientific Survey of AirWarfare, after considering the question, have recommended:-&quot;That since the available evidence suggests that little,  if any assistance to anti-aircraft gunfirewould accrue from the use of coloured searchlightbeams, and since the intersections of such beams wouldbe less visible to interceptor aircraft than thoseof white beams, no action should be taken by the AirMinistry to encourage further experimental investi-gations into the possibilities of coloured beams fordetecting aircraft.&quot;3.      The Air Ministry have been experimenting withcoloured filters placed over standard searchlights, using thisarrangement to provide beacons for the guidance of fighter aircraft at night.      The experiment has been most succesful and the practice of employing coloured searchlight beams asbeacons is to be extended.4.      The conclusion would seem to be that the Germans areusing coloured searchlight beams as beacons and for the present we need not put any deeper or more subtle interpretation on thephenomenon observed by our bomber crews.
