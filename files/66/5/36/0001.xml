naval SITUATION.General Review.THE principal event of the week at sea has been the safe arrival of the firstechelons of the Australian Imperial Force and New Zealand Expeditionary force at Suez on the 12th February.H.M.S. Exeter, which was severely damaged in the Battle of the River Plate,has arrived in the United Kingdom. H.M.S. Achilles is returning to Aucklandto refit.There has been an increase of U-Boat activity, but air attack on shipping hasbeen less intense.Home Waters.2. The Home Fleet has been at sea covering the Norwegian Convoys andthe Northern Patrol.3. German air attacks on East Coast shipping between Scarborough andKinnaird Head were carried out on the 9th February. Damage to merchant shipswas negligible, one fishing trawler only being lost. (Details of these attacks aregiven in Appendix II.) Four minesweeping trawlers, the Thomas A Itoft, the fort Royal, the Robert Bowen and the Ohm, were attacked off Aberdeen. TheRobert Bowen and Fort Royal wrere sunk, the former with the loss of all on board;the Ohm was damaged, but got into harbour.H.M. Destroyer Griffin was also attacked with machine guns and sustainedtwo oasualties. &apos;    -On the 10th February an attack by aircraft was carried out on a trawler,Theresa Boyle, which was sunk 115 miles north-east of Aberdeen.4. The German S.S. Anhalt (5,900 tons) sent out distress signals on the evening of the 12th February off Hantsholm (N.W. point of Denmark) after being in cpllision. Three British submarines were ordered to take up special positionsto try anjd intercept German naval units which mighti have proceeded, to dterassistance.  Nothing, however, was sighted.5. During the week tinder review H.M.S. Glasgow relieved H.M.S.Southampton on the Norwegian Cbast patrol for the purpose of intercepting two German merchant ships believed to be taking ammunition to Murmansk. one german trawler, the HerrUchkeit (268 tons) was^eapMred hy the Glasgow.Foreign Waters.6. The first echelons of the Australian Imperial Force and New ZealandExpeditionary Force arrived at Suez on the 12th February escorted byH.M.S. Ramillies, Eagle and Hobart. The French cruiser Suffren also assisted in the escort of this force.German Intelligence.7. Reports have been received indicating that most of the Enemy&apos;s mainunits have been in the North Sea area during the week, though at the beginningof February the new cruiser Prince Eugen with the Blucher in company was reported to be carrying out trials in the Baltic which would last till the endof the month. The Emden and Karlsruhe were also reported in the Baltic area on the 4th February.On the 10th February reconnaissance placed the Scharnhorst and Gneisenauat Wilhelmshaven. No information was obtained regarding the whereabouts ofthe remaining units.Latest indications place enemy submarines at sea on the 15th February asfollows :  -2 in Western Approaches. :        1     *     ,1 off Portugal.1 West of Ireland (outward bound).1 in Moray Firth.1 off the Norwegian Coast, probably going northwards.
Protection of Seaborne Trade.8. A total of 685 vessels has been convoyed during the week; 495 British,30 Allied and 160 Neutral. &apos;     .Convoys have arrived from Halifax, Sierra Leone and Gibraltar, comprising98 ships.  In addition 69 ships have arrived in convoy from Norway.One ship only the British T?-iumph-was lost in convoy; it is almost certainthat this was due to a mine, and not to torpedo attack.43 destroyers, 24 escort vessels, 3 submarines, 9 armed merchant cruisers,besides 3 cruisers and 2 battleships have been employed in close escort duties.Since commencement of hostilities total number of ships convoyed! is:  British ...................       7,936of these 17 British and 2 Neutrals have been sunk, giving a percentage of approxi-mately 0-2 per cent., or 1 in 530.Anti-Submarine Operations.9. During the week under review there have been 14 attacks on submarines 12 by surface craft and 2 by aircraft. Of the former, one by H.M.S. Gleaner on11.33 in the approaches to the Clyde was definitely successful 3 officers and16 ratings being taken prisoner, and 22 bodies recovered.There is also reason to hope that an attack carried out by two anti-submarinetrawlers, Le Tiger and! Cape Warwick, in the approaches to the Forth waseffective; and an attack by H.M.S. WHITSHED, on the 14th, on the submarinebelieved to be that which had just torpedoed the Sultan Star, was almost certainlydecisive.German Attack on Seaborne Trade.10. The total tonnage, British, Allied and Neutral lost through enemy actionduring the week was 59,041, of which 26,727 was British.There was an increase of U-boat activity, 3 British ships and 5 Neutralhaving been attacked, of which all but one were sunk. Details of these attacks,as well as of 2 British and 4 Neutral merchant ships mined or lost throughunknown causes are shown in Appendix I. Two particularly flagrant cases,indicative of the complete German disregard of elementary neutral rights, werethe sinking of the Dutch s.s. Burgurdijk and the Danish s.s. Chastine Maersk. Theformer was attacked off the Scilly Isles whilst on passage from New York toRotterdam, and the latter 65 miles north-east of Shetlands, whilst on passage fromMorocco to Denmark.   Neither had any business with Great Britain; .Details of attacks by aircraft on East Coast shipping will be found inAppendix II; as previously mentioned, the results obtained were negligible.British s.s. Ample forth, shown in Weekly Resume No. 23 as overdue, hashow arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, 17 days late.German Minelaying.11. Moored mines, which had been recently laid, have been swept up hearCromer Knoll.The survivors of U.33 stated that they had laid 5 mines before being sunk;tiie accuracy of this statement has not-been-confirmed. : iv liBritish Mine Sweeping.12. The Port of Dundee, which at,the date of issue of the last resume was closed on account of the loss of the Estonian s.s Ami, was reopened on the10th February. ... rIn the vicinity of the Sunk Light Vessel LI.M.S. Borde. has exploded fourmines, and the double &quot; L &quot; sweep one; skids detonated one off Lowestoft.AlliedNeutral495538Total8,969[208-29]b 2
Up to date, apart from casualties, 176 moored and 41 magnetic mines havebeen accounted for; the latter.include 16 by H.M.S. Borde, 9 by magnetic sweep,5 by skids, 8 miscellaneous and 3 recovered. It is now almost certain that themagnetic mines laid from submarines work in the Same way as those laid by aircraft. Experiments have been carried out to deal with these mines, and thefuture policy for dealing with them has now been decided. This includes24 pairs of ships fitted with double &quot; L &quot; sweeps, which will be ready by the endof March, and 10 ships similar to the Borde, besides a large number of skids andtowing craft.German Merchant Shipping.13. Information having been received that 6 German merchant ships had left Vigo on the night of the 10th February, an operation, in which both Britishand French forces participated, was carried out during the 12th to the 14thi...... with the object of intercepting them.   On the 12th s.s. Morea (1,927 tons) was captured by H.M. destroyers Hardy and Hero some 300 miles west of Vigo;an attempt to scuttle her was foiled by the prize crew.   On the same day, French forces captured the Rostock (2,542 tons) just outside territorial watersoff Vigo;,she was added to a French convoy which was conveniently passingen route for a French port.  None of the other ships have been located up to date,, but patrols to the north-westward of the Orkneys have been specially strengthenedon the assumption that the German ships are proceeding to Germany.14. In the South Atlantic, s.s. Wakama (3,771 tons), which left Rio deJaneiro on the 11th February with a cargo of hides, mica and wool, set herself on fire on the 12th to avoid capture by H.M.S. Dorsetshire, whose aircraft hadsighted her.  Ten officers and 36 men were picked up; the ship was sunk.Economic Warfare.15.   The tonnage of ships entering and clearing British ports continues torise.Imports in convoyed ships during the period the 4th February-lOth Februaryinclusive, show an increase of 222,249 tons over the previous week. Exceptionallylarge entries of fuel oil and cereals were received, and during the week ending the 10th February a further 3,189 tons of cargo destined for Germany were seizedin prize, which included 1,163 tons of base metals, 880 tons of food-stuffs, &amp;c.Accidents.16. On the 7th February, H.M. patrol vessels Mallard and Pintail were in collision; as a result Mallard requires to be docked.H.M.S. Revenge, while leaving Halifax in a fog, collided with the tankerAppalachee; temporary repairs can be effected by the Ship&apos;s staff.On the 10th February a collision occurred in the Clyde approaches betweenH.M.S. Suffolk and the s.s. Masirah (6,578 tons), resulting in the cruiser being-holed abreast of &quot; B &quot; Turret, and Masirah receiving serious damage to her bows.Three were killed and eight injured in Suffolk.On the same day, the s.s. Branksea (214 tons), an intended block-ship forScapa, sank off Aberdeen while in tow, the mate of the tug being killed.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.17. Apart from the usual patrolling and artillery activity, no operations have occurred during the week under review.Germany.Distribution of the German Army.18. The distribution of German divisions shows an increase of one in Poland,this is the only change reported. The total is now believed to be 143-145. InWeekly Resume No. 23, paragraph 27, the heading &apos;&apos; Mountain &apos;5 should havebeen &quot; Motorised.&quot;
Western Defences. ;-! i 1 - &apos;;   * &apos; i   *m    o19. In spite of the advanced state of construction and the undeniajalestrength of the Siegfried Line on the outbreak of war, work has been carried butunceasingly during the past five months. It is clear that the intention is to maikethe &quot;West Wail1&apos; impregnable, even if held by a minimum number of troops.On the outbreak of war the Siegfried Line extended &quot;from&apos; 25 miles north,1 ofAachen to Basle, the area; south of Aachen and the Saar; front being the strongest parts.The German estimate of the density of the fortifications required appears tobe very high. No area which depends for its protection on artificial fortifications,and in which woods and rivers do not form part of the system, has less than tenforts per square kilometre. These are fronted by a continuous belt of barbed wire and, in most places, by an anti-tank obstacle with a minimum of four rowsof concrete &quot; elephant&apos;s teeth,&quot;&quot;- The average depth of the system is three to four kilometres.In the early months of the war, the strengthening of the existing systemtook priority over extending the line. More forts were added and, in many places,&quot; elephant&apos;s teeth &quot; obstacles were increased from four to eight rows. The line in the area south of Trier, between the Bivers Mosel and Saar, and the Saarfront were the first to be strengthened, but later reports showed that the work was being carried out uniformly over the whole line.In the middle of October a further fortified line was being prepared 25 to30 miles in rear of the front line to block the main avenues of approach to CentralGermany. &apos;Towards the end of 1939 work was in progress on a northern and southernextension to the main Siegfried Line.A recent report indicates that a reserve position may be under constructionbetween Frieburg and Kehl in the Upper Rhine area.Soviet Russia.20. The morale of the Red Army, though never high, shows no immediatesign of cracking; propaganda about the dreadful treatment which the Finns meteout to their prisoners is still sufficiently effective to prevent any tendency to surrender freely. On the other hand, conversations with Russian prisoners makeit clear that there is no enthusiasm about the war, and that political Commissarsare very unpopular with the army.Secret reports suggest that a general feeling of uncertainty and fear isappearing among Red Army officers in the distant Trans-Caucasian MilitaryDistrict as a result-of the failures in Finland. Every officer mistrusts his fellowsand all fear a renewal of the purge. It is probable, therefore, that this feeling of uneasiness is fairly widespread throughout the Red Army.The morale of the civil population is also depressed. Leningrad is drasticallyblacked out, so much so that there is hardly enough light to read in the hotels; theonly entertainment provided comes from loud speakers which constantly blare outpatriotic songs. Food in the hotels is scarce and bad; coffee, beer, vodka andmineral waters are unobtainable. Trains are hours late, and not even tea isobtainable on them. Reports from Moscow indicate dissatisfaction at the food shortage, and some apprehension at the number of wounded appearing. this feeling is probably not confined to Moscow, as wounded are being sent to hospitals in most of the big towns within 150 miles of the capital. There is, however, no sign of any general unrest.Italy,21. There has been little military activity in Italy during the week underreview. All reports indicate an increasing state of nervous anticipation as towhat may happen in the spring, and rumours of a spring mobilisation continueto circulate.Work on the defences of both the Italo-German and Italo-Yugoslav frontiersis proceeding with some haste. Work on defences south of the Brenner Pass isbeing carried on day and night.No confirmation has been received of reports of the move, or projected move,of formations from Libya, although the employment of some of the largest linersof the Lloyd Triestino Line for trooping purposes indicates; that this possibilitystill exists.
;yAIbania.22. There are indications that bad weather, and possibly also some difficulty with local Albanian labour, have seriously interfered; with the road-building programme in Albania during the past month/&apos;Egypt and Palestine.23. The first echelons of the Australian Imperial Force and the New ZealandExpeditionary Force arrived at Suez on the 12th February. Each echelonconsists of divisional headquarters, one brigade group, a proportion of divisionaltroops, and advance parties of later echelons.The Australians moved into camp in the Gaza-Beersheba area of palestine and will carry out their training there. The New Zealanders are training in the cairo area.The third echelon of the 1st Cavalry Division comprising the 4th CavalryBrigade and a proportion of divisional troops left the United Kingdom betweenthe 1st and 8th February, and are due at Haifa on or about the 19th February.With the arrival in Palestine of this echelon the division, with the exception ofa few details, will have completed its concentration.Iran.24. The army peace strength of 9 divisions (112,000 men) is in processof being mobilised and expanded to 12 divisions and 2 cavalry divisions by the15th April. -20,000 reservists were called up, ostensibly for one month&apos;s training, inFebruary. Owing to lack of horses and guns the Army is weak in artillery,and the administrative services are woefully deficient.North-West Frontier of India.25, For the last three years lawlessness has prevailed to such an extent inthe Bannu district that there is complete disregard of law and&apos; order.One of the contributory causes of the success of the raiding gangs is thepresence, a few miles to the north-west of Bannu, of a small but intricate tractof country known as the Ahmedzai Salient. This area affords an ideal refugefor recalcitrant tribesmen, and the Government of India is now initiatingmilitary operations to drive them out preparatory to the construction of roads and posts, and the transfer of the area to the civil administration.Far East.26. Japanese aircraft are reported to have again bombed the French-ownedHaiphong-Yunnan Railway inside Chinese territory.As a result of a somewhat more reasonable attitude on the part of thelocal Japanese military authorities, the internal situation at Shanghai seemsto have improved vis-a-vis the foreign settlement administration and the puppetregime in control of the district.AIR SITUATION.  .Royal Air Force Operations.Bomber Command.27. The unfavourable weather conditions which brought air operationsalmost to a standstill last week have continued, many aerodromes have beenunserviceable and operations generally restricted.28. Three sweeps have been undertaken over the Western area of the north sea, by 18 Wellingtons on the i 1th February, by 12 Wellingtons on the 13thand by 15 Blenheims on the 14th. No suitable targets were observed on theseflights. . &apos;-&apos;29. A Blenheim aircraft was despatched to the Ems. Estuary on the14th February, to investigate a report that enemy destroyers and submarines
were anchored off the estuary and unable to enter owing to the presence of ice:The pilot reported a number of merchant ships iced up in the reconnaissance-area but he did not locate the reported warships. A second reconnaissance on the same day encountered adverse weather conditions but was able to give partialconfirmation of the report of the earlier air reconnaissance. A third aircraft was sent to look for these enemy vessels off Heligoland on the 15-th February,;but the pilot was unable to reach his objective because of very severe weather conditions.     -     -, . - ---- .Fighter Command.30. 449 patrols, involving 1,168 aircraft, were despatched during the week.Most of these patrols were in connection with the protection of shipping.Special Fighter Patrols were detailed to investigate unidentified aircraftplotted off the East Coast on the 8th, 10th, lith and 12th February, but no&apos;interceptions were made. On the 13th, enemy aircraft were plotted at 1.700 hoursapproaching the Thames Estuary from the direction of the Dutch Coast, andat 1730 hours a section of Spitfires intercepted one Heinkel 111 off Margate,flying at 20,000 feet. After an engagement in which it appears that the Fleinkelwas damaged, the enemy aircraft escaped; taking advantage of cloud and thefading light. 1 &apos;    .::31. During the German Air Force attacks on our East Coast shippingreferred to in paragraph 3, our fighters sighted enemy aircraft on five occasionsand four interceptions were made. One Heinkel was brought down on land nearNorth Berwick, one is known to have come down in the North Sea and a third is&apos;believed to have been, damaged.Coastal Command.       -   &apos;J : &apos;.32. 153 patrols and searches were flown during the week, and 5.1 convoyswere provided with air escort.33. Three enemy submarines were sighted and two of them were attacked.No definite results can be claimed, although on the 1.0th February oil and bubbleswere observed on the surface after a submarine had been bombed approximately100 miles north-west of Cape Wrath. Special flying boat searches have been1made for German ships reported to be conveying war materials to Murmansk,and for German merchantmen homeward bound from Vigo.34. A Hudson aircraft located three enemy destroyers 35 miles south ofHorn Reefs on the 9th February. The destroyers opened heavy anti-aircraft fire on the aircraft, which attacked the rearmost ship with bombs. No direct hits were Obtained. The Hudson shadowed the destroyer until attacked by eightMesserschmitt 109 fighters, which caused some damage to our aircraft. Theenemy aircraft kept out of range of the Hudson&apos;s rear guns, and thus enabled it to escape into clouds and complete its patrol.On the same day another Hudson bombed an enemy minesweeper offHeligoland, but did not secure a direct hit.   A third Hudson patrolling nearHorn Reefs encountered a single Messerschmitt 110 fighter which avoided action&apos;with our aircraft.35. , Enemy aircraft were sighted by our Coastal Command patrols at various times during the week. On the 9th February a Blenheim sighted a Heinkel flying-low and evidently about to attack a trawler. The Heinkel immediately climbed:for the protection of the clouds and escaped. On the next day two Hudsonsintercepted a Heinkel off Duncansby Head, in the neighbourhood of both the,inward and outward bound Scandinavian convoys. After an exchange of firethe enemy aircraft jettisoned its bombs and hastily climbed into the clouds,apparently in a damaged condition. There were a few bullet holes in both ofour aircraft and one of the wireless operators was slightly wounded.36. Several floating mines have been located by our aircraft during theweek and on two occasions they were destroyed by surface craft in the vicinity.37. On the 12th February an aircraft located a ship&apos;s boat 30 miles north-east of Girdleness and directed two mine-sweepers to it. Ten men were rescued-Three lifeboats and their crews were seen by another aircraft 20 miles north-east of Muckle Flugga and the crews were picked up by a merchant ship directed tothe spot by the aircraft.
Operations in France.Royal Air Force.38. The operations of the Royal Air Force in France have also been hinderedby bad weather. Fighter activity was possible only on the 10th February, whenfive patrols were despatched.39. On the 11th February one Blenheim conducted a reconnaissance along the German-Belgian and German-Dutch frontiers to the North Sea with a viewto studying activity on these frontiers. At the end of its flight it landed inEngland. There were three layers of clouds over the reconnaissance area, andobservation proved impossible. A patrol of two Messerschmitt 110&apos;s was seennear Duisburg, and not long afterwards one attack was delivered by a singleMesserschmitt 110, without success.  Heavy anti-aircraft fire was also ineffective.French Air Force.40. The activity of the French Air Force since the 8th February has beenvery limited. Photographic reconnaissances were carried out over the Rohrbacharea on the 9th, over the right bank of the Rhine opposite Rhinau on the 10thand over the left bank of the Rhine north of Strasbourg on the 12th. Elevenfighter sorties on the 10th, twenty-eight on the 12th and two on the 14th all tookplace without combat.German Air Activity.Attacks on North Sea Shipping.41. Offensive operations have again been confined to attacks on shipping,the most important of which occurred on the 9th February, and is referred to inparagraph 3. On the 10th February a number of enemy aircraft were again at work, three distinct operations being apparent. It would appear that tworeconnaissance formations of four and ten aircraft respectively were searchingfor targets in areas off the South-East Coast of England and the Scottish Coast,while a third formation of six aircraft, probably a bomber force acting onreconnaissance reports, was operating from the Firth of Forth northwards. Theoperations were abortive, only one attack being reported on the TrawlerTheresa Boyle (115 miles east of Aberdeen) and it would appear that this attack was made by an aircraft returning from the intended area of operations.Methods adopted by the enemy in attacks on shipping.42. Reconnaissance or &quot;Fuhlungshalter &quot; aircraft search the allotted area for suitable targets. When an objective is found the &apos;&apos; Fuhlungshalter .&apos;&apos; sends toits home station a single 3-letter signal signifying &quot; I am at objective, listen in.&quot;It then transmits to the control station its position in the form of a singlefour-figure group corresponding to the map reference. The bombers then takeoff, or if already in the air, they are given the grid reference by their homestation. On reaching the position indicated, they send out a signal to that effect,and the &quot; Fuhlungshalter,&quot; which has been shadowing the target, then startstransmitting to enable the bombers to take a bearing and fly to their objective.The bombers usually attack in pairs, approaching individually from asternand diving to 800 feet before releasing their bombs in level flight. If the firstaircraft is unsuccessful, the second carries out similar tactics, and in cases where no anti-aircraft fire is experienced the ship is finally attacked by machine guns(firing armour-piercing bullets) from a height of 100 feet or less. It appearsthat weather conditions are chosen when visibility is sufficiently good for attackbut bad enough to make interception by our fighters unlikely.Foreign Air Intelligence.China.43. Aircraft failed to give much assistance to the Chinese counter-offensive against Nanning owing to two or three squadrons losing their way and crashingbefore operations started. Complete reorganisation of the Chinese Air Force isnecessary, and the Chinese are pleading for equipment and staff officers from britain.
RUSSO-FINNISH HOSTILITIES. &apos;44. The Russian offensive on the Karelian Isthmus has continued through-out the week with increased vigour. The greatest pressure has been in theSumma sector, where up to four divisions and 250 tanks are said to have been used in one attack; attacks in considerable force have also been made in the centre and in the east of the Isthmus. The latest reports put the total Russian strength on the Isthmus front at fourteen infantry divisions, with over a hundred medium and heavy batteries and a very large number of tanks.It is very difficult to estimate what progress the Russians have made, asreports are vague and conflicting. A report, dated the 10th February, statedthat the Russians had penetrated the Mannerheim Line at several points to adepth of 2 kilometres, and it seems almost certain that they have made some further progress. The Mannerheim defences have, however, a depth of about18 kilometres in the more important sectors, and it is unlikely that the extent,ofthe Russian advance is in itself of great importance. The most dangerous factorsfrom the Finnish point of view are the exhaustion of their troops arid the heavy expenditure of their limited stocks of ammunition. These difficulties are causing the Finnish General Staff grave anxiety.The situation on other fronts has undergone no change, though reinforce-ments have reached the with Soviet Army, which is operating immediatelynorth of Lake Ladoga. The 18th and 168th Red Divisions in the Kitela area andthe 54th Division further north in the Kuhmoniemi area are all practicallysurrounded; but the Finns cannot afford the ammunition for an attack and haveto wait until hunger and cold reduce the Russians to impotence. In the extremenorth, operations are at a standstill owing to the snow, but the Russians are reported to have moved considerable additional forces to Petsamo by sea fromMurmansk, and there is said to be great activity behind the lines.45. All reports agree that the morale of the Finnish nation is remarkablyhigh, and that they are prepared for any sacrifices to obtain a just peace. Thecivil population is becoming inured to air raids and pays little attention to them.Dislocation of transport and loss of time in the factories are much less serious than might be expected. Transport runs mainly at night, and except for passenger trains, is not very seriously delayed. Factories work by day and night;there is an efficient warning system which prevents all unnecessary loss of time.The morale of the troops remains excellent, though in some sectors they arevery tired.46. The, Soviet Air Force has been very active recently in attacks both ontroops and on&apos;the civil population.On one day 500 aircraft in groups of 10 to 25 bombed the Finnish main lines and immediate rear. Russian troops have been dropped by parachute but were either captured or shot.47. The following details regarding casualties of Russian aircraft up tothe 2nd February in the Russo-Finnish war have been received from an officialsource : -121 shot down by Finnish fighter aircraft.30 shot down by 76-mm. anti-aircraft guns.33 shot down by 40-mm. anti-aircraft guns.33 shot down by 20-mm. anti-aircraft guns.21 shot down by infantry weapons.28 shot down by 7-62 anti-aircraft machine guns.28 made forced landings owing to engine failure or bad weather.294Finnish fighters have also shot down 2 Russian observation balloons.48. It is reported that a third of the more modern aircraft, which until recently have been stationed in Estonia, have now been returned to Russia. these have been replaced by second-line aircraft, but the actual types are not known.[20829]
