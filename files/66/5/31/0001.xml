THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  February 1940.secret copy No.   revise.P. (40) 51.(Also CCS. (40) 234 (S).)TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It Is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE EMPLOYMENT OF ALLIED LAND FORCES IN scandinavia and FINLAND.SINCE our previous Report* on operations in Scandinavia was rendered,the giving of assistance to Finland has been added to the original conception.We think it desirable to place before the War Cabinet a clear picture of the size of the land forces which can be employed in Scandinavia and Finland, andthe manner of their employment if the projected operations take place. We feelthat there may be some misconception as to the extent of the assistance that canbe given to Finland.Object of the Campaign.2.   The object of the campaign is : To render assistance to Finland, while ensuring that the NorthernSwedish ore fields are denied to Germany and Russia.Northern Sweden.3. The role of the force in North Sweden would be to secure the Galivareore fields, in order to deny them to the Germans and the Russians, and, if drivenout, to destroy the facilities at Lulea. For this purpose the following troops would be landed at Narvik : &apos;One demi-brigade of Chasseurs Alpins.One British brigade (24th Brigade (Guards)), each battalion of whichwould have an attached company of skiers.4.   The force to assist the Finns would be made up from :- Part of the forces in paragraph \ above.A second demi-brigade of Chasseurs Alpins.Two battalions of French Foreign Legion, and possibly four Polishbattalions.Memoranutjm by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.Finland.* W.P.

5. The size of the force would be limited probably to two or three brigades,since traffic between Sweden and Finland is.at present confined to two lines : (a) The sea route from Stockholm to Hangoe. 1This is too precarious for our needs.(b) A single-line railway North of the Gulf of Bothnia beyond the junctionat Boden.This railway is already carrying supplies for the Swedishvolunteer forces operating in the Salla area, and a large proportion ofall the warlike stores which are being sent by various nations to aidFinland.6. It is not intended to undertake operations South of a line drawn Eastand West through Kerni. The most probable area of joperations would be theSalla front or to the North.1 &apos; Operations in the South of Finland or in the Suomussalmi areas are ruled out by the distance involved and the threat to the communications of the force which might develop from a German landing on the shores of the Gulf ofBothnia.1South Norway and Sweden.7. To secure our bases, we shall have to occupy the ports of Stavanger,Bergen and Trondheim in Southern Norway. We must at the same time be readyto give assistance to the Swedes against a German invasion.For these purposes, the following troops would be employed  Southern Norwegian Ports-Five battalions of the 49th Division.Southern Sweden 5th (regular) Division from France.42nd and 44th (T.A.) Divisions; whose departure to France has beenheld up.One brigade of the 49th Division, for duties on the line ofcommunication.Limitations on Total Forces Employed.8. Owing to the limited transportation facilities in Norway and Sweden,it would certainly not be safe to count on maintaining anything more than about one division in Finland and four in South Sweden.The transportation facilities are likely to be further restricted-on accountof-(a) Enemy air action on a considerable scale.(b) The occupation by Germany of Southern Sweden and a German blockade of the Baltic ports.A large proportion of Sweden&apos;s imports might have to pass through Trondheim, which would be the principal base port of theAllies.Reinforcements for Southern Sweden.9. The possibility of reinforcing the troops sent to Southern Sweden will depend on two factors : (i) The availability of additional troops trained and equipped.Until about the middle of June, these could only be obtained bywithdrawing troops from France.(ii) The limitations imposed by the maintenance facilities in Scandinavia.These are described in the previous paragraph. Experience alonewill show whether these limitations have been overestimated, but- thereis, at least, the possibility that the effect of air action againstTrondheim and the communications to the South may have been under-estimated.
Summary.10. To sum up, the forces proposed for employment in Scandinavia aridFinland are as follows : Northern Sweden.Initially, about two Brigades (British and French).Finland.Two or three Brigades (British and French).Southern Norwegian Ports.Five battalions (British).Southern Sweden.Three Divisions and one Brigade (British).11. The possibility of sending additional troops, if these can be madeavailable from France, could only be determined in the light of experience of therailway facilities available and the scale of air attack on communications.(Signed) DUDLEY POUND.     :EDMUND IRONSIDE.R.
