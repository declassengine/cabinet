SECRET. COPY NO........7. .WEEKLY REPORT (NO.   22) ON AIR operations and INTELLIGENCE FOR THE WEEK ENDING MIDNIGHT4TH FEBRUARY,  1940.OPERATIONS.Bomber Command.1.       Weather conditions were such that operations were almost at a standstill during the week.      There is nothing to record except a practice sweep by six aircraft on 1st February inthe Western part of the North Sea.     Visibility on that occasionwas extremely bad and nothing of particular interest was seen.2,       Leaflet-carrying balloons were released with afavourable wind on the nights of 30th and 31st January, and 1stand 2nd February,  and more than 300,000 leaflets were distributed.If conditions remained constant,  the area of distribution should include Nuremberg, Weiden, Magdeburg and Munich.Fighter Commando3,       As on 17th and 18th &quot;December,  and 9th - 12th January,the German Air Force took the opportunity given by conditions of low visibility during the week to organise extensive raids on east coast shipping,  and on this occasion they had the further advantageof heavy snowfall, which made a considerable number of our aerodromes unserviceable,      In the middle of the week the weather was such as to restrict enemy activity as severely as it did ourown, but there were widespread raids on the 29th and 30th january and on 3rd February,      The chronicle of events is briefly asfollowsOn the 29th January the attackers appear to have come over in three series, reaching the coastal area of the North Sea atwidely scattered points at about 9 acm,t about mid-day,  and about p.in.     The first two series together appear to have comprisedabout thirty-six aircraft, and the third was considerabls?- smaller.One convoy and about twenty-five isolated ships were attacked./The

The convoy, which was attacked at various times &quot;by about twelvebombers,  escaped damage, but one isolated vessel was sunk,  and two others had to be beached.      Serious damage was done to theEast Dudgeon Light Vessel, whose crew perished.      Three inter-exceptions were made by our fighters off Scotland and the NorthEast Coast of England, without success,  and anti-aircraft guns were in action at Tyncmouth.4.       On 30th January, from thirty to forty German aircraft were again engaged,  and the peak period of activity was between11 a.nio  and mid-day, with a second smaller peak in the earlyevening,,      About fifty ships were attacked,  including H. M.Minesweeper &quot;Niger&quot; and the Hurn.ber and Kentish Knock Light Vessels.Pour British vessels are reported sunk and two ashore.      Fortyfighter patrols,  involving ninety-nine aircraft, took off,  and five enemy aircraft were sighted during the day (  in addition tothe two aircraft sighted by Coastal   Command units).     One of these was shot down and another which was attacked was later heard tosend out S.O.S. messages.     Anti-aircraft guns were again inaction in the Tyne area.      On 31st January, weather conditions were worse than on the previous day,  and enemy activity was limitedto an evening raid by about seven aircraft which scattered widelyand bombed two ships.      One of these,  the Danish vessel &quot;Vidar&quot;,is reported to have been sunk.      Searchlights picked up oneHeinkel 111 off Skcgness at about 5,20 p0m., but no interceptionswere made,5,       The 1st. and 2nd February were blank days, except for asingle meteorological reconnaissance aircraft which was seen by fighters off the Norfolk coast but escaped.      On the 3rd,  about twenty-four enemy aircraft were active, with peaks of activity abotrfc9 a.m.  and toward mid-day;    six aircraft were seen by our fighters and seven by aircraft of Coastal Command.      Conditions south of theWash were very poor, with a visibility of no more than 500 yards and/

and continual showers of sleet and snow.    Further north, inbetter weather, our fighters had considerable success.     Ofthe six aircraft seen,  three were shot down, and one morewas damaged and was later heard to send out so.,S. messages to its base a    Two convoys and twenty-two isolated ships were attacked, and reports have been received of two ships abandoned and five damaged;    these latter include ELM, Minesweeper&quot;Sphinx&quot;o    Two of these ships claim to have scored hits on theaircraft which attacked theme6C      On 4th February the only record of enemy activity was an isolated attack, by two aircraft on a British ship a hundredmiles off the Coast,Coastal Command,7o      Patrols were somewhat reduced,  especially towardthe middle of the week, but thirty-nine convoy escorts were provided, and encounters with enemy units were fairly numerous.The submarine Ut 55 which had already been attacked by H.M.S.&quot;Fowey&quot; and by the French destroyer &quot;Valmy&quot;, was seen on the surface by a flying boat, apparently unable to dive;    it was bombed and machine-gunned, and subsequently t;ank0       Anothersubmarine was sighted in the North Sea on 2nd February, about three miles from our aircraft;      Two bombs were dropped from800 feet, but the submarine crash-dived as the aeroplaneapproached,, and the bombs fell wide,,    On the same date,aircraft with the Fast Coast convoy sighted two mines closeahead of the convoy and pointed them out to accompanyingdestroyers, which sank them,8,      On the 29th January, one of our aircraft on routinepatrol encountered a Messerschmitt 110 some 80 miles off Horn*sReef, and after a short encounter lost contact with it in cloudyThere were 7^1:^ of rS^mage to the enemy;s port engine, and someten/

ten &quot;bullet-holes in our aircraft, which suffered no substantialdamage    On the same day;, the flying boat base at Sollum Voe inthe Shetlands was attacked by three Dornier 17!s and one other german aircraft, but no damage was done,,    Two enemy aircraft were seen in the Western North Sea on the 30th January, and sevenon the 3rd February,,    Of these latter, throe were Heinkel 111K!which were seen attacking ships off Flamhorough Head by an Ansonon convoy duty:       Our aircraft at once attacked and engaged twoof the enemy aircraft;    and though the comha :;-s were indecisivethe enemy broke off their raid and disappeared in the clouds,90      The attacks on shipping have increased the responsibilities of Coastal Command in rescue work as well asin defence,    A search for survivors of the East Dudgeon LightVessel was unsuccessfulj but on 2nd February a raft with sevenmen was sighted and reported by an aircraft operating from Wick,and on the 3rd,, rescuers were directed to a ship&apos;s lifeboat withnine men off Flambcrough Head,British Air Forces in Frances10.      Operations have again been on a restricted scale andthere is nothing to report beyond the usual fighter patrols,which had no encounters with enemy aircraft0Overseas Commandse110     The usual patrols were flown in the Mediterranean on anti-submarine and convoy duty,,lETJ^IGENCE,German Act ivityB12,     Details of the enemy raids during the week are givenin paragraphs 3-6 above,    These raids were carried out almostentirely by aircraft of the bomber Geschwader 26, which is normally located ncar Hamburg and seems on this occasion to havebeen/

been operating from Sylt,   The Geschwader normally consists ofabout 80 aircraft, of which one Gruppe (30 - 40 aircraft)appears to have been active on 29th and 30th January.    TheGeschwader is armed with Heinkel lllfs and Junker 88&apos;s, and has lost four of the former during the week while at least two others were heard reporting serious damage.    Enemy aircraftcontinue to act, singly or in pairs, at widely divergent points9Incendiary bombs have been much used, and the number of high explosive bombs dropped by single aircraft suggests that theyare of a light type, suitable for attack on unarmoured vessels^Although these raids were on a larger scale than anything whichhad preceded them, it is clear that the German Command is stillpursuing a policy of limited liability, making attacks only under favourable conditions and conserving aircraft, oil and personnel so far as possible.    Activity by German Coastal unitshas been almost at a standstill, probably because anchoragesare frozen up.French Activity.13.     French air operations were almost entirely restricted to 29th January and 3rd February,    Twenty-five fighter sorties were made on these two days, without encountering the enemy^ andon the 29th January two photographic reconnaissances were carried out on the Saar front and along the Rhine.    A similarreconnaissance sent out on 3rd February was forced by bad weather to abandon its task.The Russo-Finnish War.14.     In the earlier part of the week, Russian raids tookplace at widely separated points, but were carried out bycomparatively small numbers of bombers and directed mainly atobvious strategic points, such, as Hango, Abo and Rovaniemi,The/

(France)(Italy)(UoS,.A, )The last-mentioned town was heavily bombed, but no damage ofmilitary importance to the Northern railway or highway is reported,,The first attempts at night bombing by the Russians are also reported.      The Finns claim to have replied by attacks onKronstadt? on the supply road from Kandalaksha to Salla, andon the Leningrad-Viborg railway,,      They admit the loss of one aircraft but claim that Russian aircraft losses were very heavy.On 3rd February, Russian raids were on a much larger scale - Itis said that 400 aircraft were involved - and were directed againstmany separate points u      The Finns claim twelve bombers- certainly,,and seventeen possibly,  shot down,,15.      It is understood that the following foreign aircraftmay now be made available for \ise by the Finns30   Morane fighters83   Caudron fighters45    Koolhoven fighters33   Fiat fighters44   Brewster fightersThe Moranes have already been despatched, but the Fiats andBrewsters are not expected to arrive before the end of February,and the delivery of the Caudrons and Koolhovens will be spreadover some three months.      Two Fiats which are already in Finlandare said to have proved quite.unsuitable to present weather conditions there.South Eastern Europe016,      There is no confirmation of reports of large deliveries of Italian aircraft to Hungary, but seventy fighters of recenttypes have been on order for some time, and it is possible thatthe Italians may also transfer to Hungary some of their semi-obsolete aircraft which are now passing out of service in theirown Air Force.      There are rumours of Italian requests for passage through Yugoslavia and fr.r  hbr use of Hungarian aerodromes in the/event

V &quot; %      -7-event of Soviet action in the Balkans.17.     Bulgaria has already taken into service three Dernier17&apos;s, three Heinkel lll!s and two Messers.chrn.itt 109&apos;s.      She alsoappears to have received thirty Soviet bombers and to have afurther thirty on order.      Preparations for the institution of the moscow-Sofia civil air line are in progress, and contemplate theuse of a limited number -of Soviet personnel at Bulgarian aerodromes,18.      The Yugoslavian air force is also in process of expansion, and apart from orders for about 250 aircraft fromBritish, French, Italian and German factories it is proceeding with development of airframe manufacture under licence, inparticular of Blenheims, Hurricanes and Dornier 17&apos;s.
