THE EXTENT TO WHICH SHIPPING CONSIDERATIONSCALL FOR A REVIEW .OF OUR IMPORT PROGRAMME.I.-INTRODUCTORY.I HAVE already submitted to the War Cabinet two reports (PapersW.P. (G.) (40) 11 and 22) dealing with specific aspects of the shipping problemof which, at their Meeting held on the 22nd December, 1939 (W.M. (39)122nd Conclusions, Minute 2), I was invited by the War Cabinet to carry out a survey. I now circulate for the consideration of my colleagues the present report, in which I discuss the extent of our capacity to import goods in the first year of the war, and suggest means for keeping our impoit-proff^Jiiiaa^dAhinthev bounds of. whaf js..pi;aelteabIe. XTTave attempted to take a broad view of theposition rather than to make a detailed statistical analysis; only the Departmentsconcerned can deal effectively with the detailed statistics. I have, however,studied the problem sufficiently closely to convince myself that any error in thefigures given is on the side of caution.2. I have in preparation also a further report dealing with variousmiscellaneous shipping questions, such as the problem presented by the considerable quantity of shipping arriving in our ports in ballast (on which our examination of actual cases is required) and similar questions. I have thought itbetter not to delay the circulation of the present Report until this further docu-ment was available, in view of the extreme urgency and importance of the diffi-culties confronting us in carrying out our import programme. In. addition, I am,however, circulating simultaneously with the present Report a Report dealingwith the delays inseparable from the coiixGy^system (Paper W.P. (G.) (40) 53) anda note on the loss of importing capacity consequent upon marine casualties(Paper W.P. (G.) (40) 54), in view of the important bearing of thesg^sxrbjects onour importing capacity.II. ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF GOODS WHICH IT WILL BEPOSSIBLE TO IMPORT INTO THE UNITED KINGDOM INTHE FIRST YEAR OF THE WAR.(a) Estimate of the amount of British tonnage available to import goodsinto the United Kingdom.3. It might at first sight be thought that, with a mercantile marine of over21 million gross tons, we should, have no difficulty in war in importing to thiscountry all the goods which we require, even when account is taken of the largeshare (40 per cent.) of our peace-time imports which in peace time arrive in ships under foreign flags. It is relevant, therefore, to recall that more than half ofthe shipping which goes to make up the total appearing on the British Registeris not available for bringing imports into this country. Thus, over 1 million tonsconsists of small vessels of less than 500 gross tons; 1-g- million gross tonsconsists of vessels on the Great Lakes, river boats, dredgers, trawlers, and similarcraft; and 3-3 million gross tons consists of tankers which are not available fortransporting general cargoes. In addition, the demands of the Fighting services for tonnage are very high, amounting nearly to 2-2 million gross tons ofmerchant shipping at the present time. When account is taken of these and. similar items (particulars of which are given in Annex A. to thisReport), we find that the amount of British shipping available to import goods(other than oil) into this country is not 21 million gross tons, but only9-817 million gross tons.*   From this figure there must be made a further* This is the figure given in the Minister of Shipping&apos;s Memorandum of November 29, 1939.The corresponding figure at January 31, 1940 was 9-714 million gross tons. For particulars,see Annex A.[20851] b 2
reduction of 350,000 tons in respect of shipping allocated to France. The netamount of British shipping available for importing goods into this country is,therefore, 9 - 467 million gross tons.4. The deadweight capacity of this 9&apos; 467 million gross tons of shipping is13 -190 million tons. But this does not accurately measure the carrying capacityof the shipping concerned, for from this figure there must be made deductions inrespect of (a) bunkers, and (b) such factors as dunnage, measurement (light)cargoes, cargo discharged en route, and difference between summer and wintermarks. These deductions have been calculated by the Ministry of Shipping at-290 million tons and 1-250 million tons respectively (Paper W.P. (G.) (40) 42).We are thus left with a cargo-carrying capacity of 10 - 650 million tons.(b) Estimate of the amount of goods which it will be possible to import in-British vessels in the first year of the war.5. The amount of goods which in the course of one year can be moved from one part of the world to another by shipping of a given deadweight capacity is a function of several variables. These include the distance which the goodshave to be carried, the speed of the vessel, the nature of the cargo (which oftenexercises an important influence on the length of time required for loading ordischarging, or both), the facilities for loading at the port of departure andthose for discharging at the port of arrival, the extent to which marine casulties are sustained by the fleet engaged in carrying the goods in question, the delaysinvolved while minor repairs are effected, the length of time necessarily spent in dry-dock for cleaning, the state of the weather during the period in whichthe goods are being moved by sea, and many other factors which, as thosefamiliar with ship management are well aware, impose limitations on the useof shipping from which there is no escape.6. In addition, there are, in war time, further factors of which account must be taken. The first of these is the amount of shipping losses from enemy action which must be anticipated. The second is the need for convoying manyclasses of vessels on particular routes, which, through the various delays involved,reduces substantially the volume of imports which a given tonnage of shippingcan import into the country in any given period. As I show elsewhere,* theaverage reduction of efficiency in the use of shipping due to convoys is not lessthan 25 to 30 per cent. But this is not the only way in which the need forconvoying reduces our capacity to import goods, for the fact that under the convoy system large numbers of ships inevitably arrive at the discharging portssimultaneously leads to a &quot; bunching &apos;&apos; of ships which cannot fail to lead todislocation in the normal commercial operation of the ports, through the delay to which it gives rise in the discharge of cargoes. Finally, in war time the rateof marine casualties, is substantially higher than in peace, due very largely tocollisions of merchant ships in convoy, t7. The task of estimating the amount of imports which, with good manage-ment, it should be possible to import annually with the British shipping of thedeadweight capacity at our disposal is therefore a highly complex and technicalproblem. It can only be approached by making an analysis of goods (as set outin the actual programmes of the Ministry of Supply and the Ministry of Food)which it is desired to import, estimating separately the amount to be imported from each of the main sources of supply, since it is the geographical positionof these which determines the routes to be used by the shipping to be employedin bringing the goods in question to this country, and therefore the length ofthe voyage involved. In this way it is possible to calculate the weight andvolume of imports which the vessels employed on the various routes may beexpected to bring to this country in a given period of twelve months. It is onthese lines that the Ministry of Shipping have built up their estimate of theamount of goods which we may hope to import in British vessels in the first year of the war.* See Paper W.P. (G.) (40) 53.f See Paper W.P. (G.) (40) 54.
21* 28. In addition to the imports which we may hope to secure by the employ-ment of the 9 - 467 million gross tons of British shipping referred to in paragraph above, it will be possible (notwithstanding the loss in exchange involved) to secure some further imports by drawing to an increasing extent upon the british shipping (mostly liners) amounting to 670,000 gross tons engaged in regular trade between Empire countries and all places, other than the United Kingdom; butthe uprooting of established trades of this kind is a process both, costly and slow,Avith the result that we cannot reasonably look for much relief under this head inthe first year of the war. We may hope also to secure some imports in small vessels not included in the total of 9-467 million gross tons of British shipping.9. On the other hand, it is necessary to make certain allowances in the opposite direction. In the first place it is necessary to make a deduction in respectof vessels included in the 9-467 million gross tons, which, through being engagedin coastwise traffic, will not be available for bringing imports into this countryfor part at least of the first year of the war. Finally, it is necessary to set the new construction during the year against losses due to enemy action and ordinarymarine casualties, and to form a judgment of the net loss (if any) of gross tonnage and consequent loss of importing capacity which must be allowed for under this head.10. The number of voyages which any one vessel can make in a year dependsof course mainly upon the length of the voyage and the speed of the vessel. Thus,if a vessel could, after allowance for survey and overhaul, work for, say, 320 days in the year on round voyages taking 40 days, she would make 8 voyages, ascompared with the 2\ voyages which alone are possible for vessels bringing timber from British Columbia,. The statistical all-over average estimated for the roundvoyages of all types on all routes at the present time is 3 - 4 months; but this figuredoes not apply to individual routes or vessels. It is clearly of the first importance that a constant watch should be kept on the movements of British shipping,whether under requisition or not, in order to ensure that once a vessel has been directed to a particular route it is employed as efficiently as possible and not permitted to incur any unnecessary delay at any stage of her voyage. Thepractical problems involved are, as I have said, highly technical, and can only be adequately dealt with by experts possessing the necessary specialised knowledge and experience. The importance of this question has from the outset been recognised by the Ministry of Shipping, which established a special Departmentof the Ministry, staffed with shipping experts, for the express purpose of keepingthese problems under constant review.11, After making due allowance for the considerations indicated above andthe possibility of obtaining further tonnage by the purchase of vessels now underthe United States flag, the Ministry of Shipping estimate that the cargo-carrying capacity of 10 - 650 million tons, afforded by the 9 - 467 million gross tons of british shipping at our disposal, is equivalent to an importing capacity of 34-5 million tons of goods (other than oil) in the first year of the war, regard being had to thecountries in which these goods arc produced or in which we buy them as thecase may be.12. As explained in the Minister of Shipping&apos;s memorandum of the7th February, 1940, and the document attached thereto (Paper W.P. (G.) (40) 42),there are three other factors to be taken into account, both of which reducethe amount of goods which we may reasonably hope to import in the first year of war. The first of these factors is the contemplated purchase of a larger proportion of our imports from more distant sources of supply (e.g., wheat from australia instetid of Canada, and timber from British Columbia instead ofNorthern Europe) as the result of e^chjjrgS-^n^idssyiQS.8 (as U1 the first case) /or practical necessity (as in the second case). The effect in a full year of such changes in the sources of supply of important imports is estimated by the Ministerof Shipping as representing a loss in our total importing capacity of some4 million tons. The loss of importing capacity on this account in the first year of the war is estimated at 1^5,.million tons. The second factor of which account must be taken is the loss of importing capacity due to the continuous use..bv theEigji.tj.ng Services of merchant tonnage in excess of the amount originally allowed for.*  The third of these factors is to be found in the fact that the reduction of* The figure originally allowed for by the Ministry of Shipping in respect of this item was1-94 million tons, but the amount of tonnage actually allocated to the Fighting Services hadsgrown to 2-12 million tons by December 81, 1939, and to 2-20 million tons by February 11,1940.
imports due to shipping losses and to the coastwise use of ocean-going yesselsis now found not tooe-fuTly 6^set7&quot;as was previously anticipated, by the importsbrought to this country in small vessels. The Minister of Shipping estimates that in a full year our loss of importing capacity on account of these last two factors may amount to 1 million tons, and in the period remaining up to the31st August next to 700,000 tons (the amounts allowed for these two factorsbeing 400,000 tons and 300,000 tons respectively).13. After making the adjustments necessary for the two factors referredto in the preceding paragraph, the Ministry of Shipping have reached the con-clusion that the total imports (other than oil) reaching this country during thefirst year of the war in British tonnage should be put not at 34-5 million tons, thefigure given in paragraph 11 above, but at 32-7 million tons.(c) The volume of imports required to be brought to this country in neutral vessels in the first year of the war on the basis of the present programme.14. In his Memorandum of the 15th November, 1939 (Paper W.P. (G.) (39)89), the Minister of Shipping furnished an estimate of the imports which could,on a number of assumptions, be brought into the United Kingdom in the first year of the war. This estimate (which it should be noted was prepared before themagnetic mine campaign and the later attacks on shipping from the air, both ofwhich developments acted as serious deterrents with the neutrals) was sub-dividedby the Minister of Shipping as follows : Million tons.Commodities controlled by Ministry of Food       ...   19-800*Commodities specifically covered by Ministry ofSupply programme, including molasses ...   23-900Miscellaneous and unallocated items...      ...      ...     3-30047-00015. As explained in paragraph 13, the Minister of Shipping now estimates that it will not be possible in the period under review to import more than32-7 million tons in British vessels. Thus, if the full import programme of47 million tons is to be achieved by the end of August next, it will be necessaryfor 14-3 millions tons to be imported in foreign ships.16. In the meanwhile experience has shown that the prospect of oursecuring the import of goods into this country in neutral vessels is considerably less favourable than we had previously supposed. This lTno doubt due mainly to the German attacks by torpedo and mine on neutral shipping trading toBritish ports; and at the close of last year these difficulties were enhancedthrough the menace of the magnetic mine. Fears on this latter account will, wemay hope, soon be reduced by the measures now being devised, but the fact remains that under pressure of German lawlessness neutral shipoAvners are mostunwilling to send their ships to this country, and neutral crews are becoming more and more unwilling to sail in such neutral ships as come to our ports. Atthe present time neutral shipowners are striving in every way to find employment for their tonnage on any route lying outside the danger zone, not only in deference to German threats, but also because employment in neutral trades is highly profitable owing to the high freights obtainable.17 The problem of the extent to which, and the manner in wdiich, we may hope to bring pressure to bear on neutrals to place a larger amount of theirtonnage at our disposal is, in my view, one of increasing importance; and I draw the Cabinefs urgent attention to it. For the present purpose, it is sufficient to note that, while it will, I hope, be possible to secure some improvement throughputting pressure not only on neutral shipowners, but also on neutral Govern-ments, it would be unwise to look for any great improvement under this head.It is important also to realise that a substantial increase in the amount of neutral tonnage under time-charter to us would not necessarily provide us with a largely* The Ministry of Food are working to an import programme of 19-39 million tons, but this figure excludes certain-livestock and other imports from Eire. When account is taken of these,the Ministry&apos;s programme requires to he increased to 19-800 million tons, the figure given above.
increased importing power; for the time-chartering of neutral tonnage onlyincreases our capacity to import, where the tonnage so chartered is tonnage which,if not chartered, would not come to United Kingdom ports at all and the chartering of which does not have the effect of displacing tonnage which otherwise would come to the United Kingdom. The administrative advantage securedthrough the power to control the movement of a given vessel by reason of its being under time-charter does not of itself provide a sufficient reason to takethe vessel on time-charter, if in the ordinary course of events she would anyhowbe engaged, in trade with this country.18. There is one other point in connexion with the chartering of neutral tonnage to which I should refer at this point. It is this. Such tonnage cannotbe looked upon from a purely United Kingdom angle, since it has been agreed thatneutral tonnage chartered by ourselves and by the French should constitute a poolto be drawn upon in such proportions as circumstances may from time to timeshow to be desirable in the common interest of the Allied cause. This problem,which is one of great technical intricacy, is at present under examination by theAnglo-French Shipping Executive Committee; and it is not possible at this stage to say more than that there is a likelihood that the^needs of the French. wjlLp.esuch that it will be necessajrjMlorjfchjs^^neuTral shipping. ItTmaTltherefore happen that the pool of neutral shipping fromwhicfTwe ourselves may hope to take vessels on time-charter will be reduced onthis account.19. Exclusive of 43,000 gross tons of foreign vessels under time-charter, butin use by the Fighting Services and therefore not available for importing goodsinto the United Kingdom, arrangements have been made for the time-chartering*of 235,000 gross tons of neutral vessels, of which 138,000 gross tons have alreadybeen delivered. The deadweight capacity of the foregoing vessels (full particulars of which are given in Annex B to the present Report) amounts to 397,000 tons.After deductions have been made for bunkers and other necessary allowances, this tonnage should be capable at the present time of importing approximately-25 million tons of goods in the course of the year.f The great majority of thevessels in question are either under the Greek flag (134.000 gross tons, charteredby the Ministry of Shipping) or under the Norwegian flag (50,000 gross tonschartered by British companies). There is reason to hope that during the last six months (March to August 1940) of the first year of the war. it will be possibleconsiderably to increase the amount of neutral tonnage now under time-charter.20. In the first five months of the war (September 1939 to January 1940)imports to this country in foreign vessels (including both those under time-charter and those trading to this country independently) amounted to 4 million tons.Thus, during these five months, imports were arriving in foreign vessels atthe rate of 8-6 million tons per annum. The Ministry of Shipping hope that itmay&quot;be possibleTiithe first year of the war to secure a larger quantity of imports in vessels now under foreign flags. In view of the rate at which imports in foreignvessels have been arriving since the beginning of the Avar, it seems to me not unreasonable to assume that such imports are not likely to amount to less than9 million tons nor to more than 12 million tons in the first year of the Avar.III. THE EXTENT TO WHICH SHIPPING DIFFICULTIES may require A REDUCTION IN OUR IMPORT programme for THE FIRST YEAR OF THE WAR,21. It is naturally impossible for the Ministry of Shipping, at so early a stage and with so many variable factors involved, to commit themselves to adefinite estimate of the total amount of goods (other than oil) Avhich we shall be* The length of a time-charter varies according to the particular arrangements made, but ingeneral it may be taken that the period covered by such charters is between six arid twelvemonths.f It will be observed that the amount of imports which can be brought to this country inone year by the foreign vessels now under time-charter is not more than about one-eighth of thetotal amount of imports which we may hope to receive in foreign vessels in the first year of thewar, even if there is no improvement in the present rate at which we are receiving imports insuch vessels.
able to import in the first year of the war; hut if we succeed in importing inBritish vessels 32-7 million tons (the figure given in paragraph 13) and if theamount to be imported in vessels now under foreign flags is taken as lying between9 million tons and 12 million tons we find that the position is as follows : 1 million tons.To be imported in British vessels       ...       ...      ...      32-7To be imported in foreign vessels        ...       ...       ...        9-1241-7-44-722. Thus on the more favourable of the foregoing assumptions we mightsucceed in achieving all but 2 million tons of our present import programme of47 million tons, while on the less favourable assumption we should fail to doso by as much as 5 million tons. At this point it must be recalled that thepresent import programme of 47 million tons represents the amount which wehave so far considered as being essential to secure the threefold objective whichwe have so far pursued, namely :(i) the achievement of our war effort, on the scale which we have set our-selves, on the maintenance of which the War Cabinet agreed at their meeting held on the 13th February, 1940 (W.M. (40) 40th Conclusions,Minute 1);(ii) the maintenance of a substantial export trade;(hi) the maintenance of civil consumption at approximately its present level.23. Faced with the possibility of so large a deficit, it would be unwise to hope that a fresh equilibrium could be achieved without drastic and timelysteps being taken to secure that end. Any attempt to deal with this problem in a piecemeal fashion would not only be foredoomed to failure but would alsoaggravate the difficulties in which we find ourselves.24. It is not necessary for me to stress the gravity of the situation whichmay be created by our shipping difficulties. The facts clearly speak for them-selves. Nor is it necessary, I am sure, to do more to show&apos; how urgent it isthat we should arrive at the best practicable solution of the problem, sincewith the passage of every week the likelihood grows that some of the imports which are arriving are imports which in the last resort we could do without,with the result that at the end. of the first year of the war we may find that we have failed to obtain imports which are absolutely vital to our war effort.IY. INCREASED SHIPPING DIFFICULTIES OF WHICH account should BE TAKEN IN FRAMING OUR IMPORT programme for THE SECOND YEAR OF THE WAR.25. It is almost certain that with only six months of the first year of thewar left to run we shall not be able fully to secure that the imports actuallyreceived in that period are those which we most urgently require. We shall,therefore, start the second year of the war with an unbalanced import programme, which wall necessarily include considerable quantities of essential goods which were required for our war effort in the first year of the war, but which we were unable to import in that period since the shipping space requiredfor such imports was used to carry to this country goods of less essential (or insome cases, of a non-essential) character. But there are other more serious factors which point to the conclusion that, even when account is taken of our presentmerchant shipbuilding programme, our shipping difficulties, like our exchange difficulties, will be greater in the second year of the war than in the first, andwill continue to increase for so long as the war continues.26. In the first place it is impossible to doubt that once active militaryoperations are begun the essential requirements of the lighting Services&apos;&apos;-wiilresult in greatly increased demands for the import of raw materials, and conse-quently in substantial demands for additional shipping space. The amount ofsuch demands it is, however, impossible at this stage to predict.
27. Quite apart, however, from the inevitable increase in the demand forthe import of the raw materials required to maintain our war effort, the transitionof the war from its present phase of relative inactivity to one of active militaryoperations will almost certainly bring with it other new and serious shipping difficulties. We may well be faced simultaneously wlth^bTfaHtiaimew-demamds&quot;for shipping and with an actual reduction either in the amount of shipping a tour disposal or in our capacity to discharge imports in our ports, a situationwhich would be tantamount to a reduction in the amount of importing capacity,or both.28. In the first place, the outbreak of active military operations may beexpected to create an increased demand by the Army for tonnage to maintain our army in France, and this demand will be further increased if we then strive toincrease the size of our forces on the Western Front. Nor is it safe, in considering what should be the size of our import programme in the second year of the war,to ignore the possibility that we may become engaged in military operations on other Fronts, since, if that were to happen, very large amountsDf &quot;BriTisE niercEanttonhage&quot;&quot;at present engaged in bringing imports into this country would have tobe diverted at short notice and for an indefinite period to purely military purposes.29. At the very moment when we are faced with these new demands for shipping, we may suffer for a time at least mci&amp;aged.. losses through theintensification of the efforts of the enemy both by naval and air action to destroyour shipping. The loss so sustained would almost certainly be aggravated by further injury to our importing capacity consequent on air attack on our ports and inland communications. At the beginning of the war we anticipated thatenemy pressure by naval action, by mine, and by air attack, might reach suchdimensions that it would be necessary for us to divert a large part, if not thewhole, of our seaborne trade from East Coast to West Coast ports. Fortunately,we have so far not been forced to adopt this course, except to a limited extent andfor short periods. But the risk that we may at any time have to do so remainsas real as ever; and it is essential that we should give full weight to this considera-tion in planning our import programme for the second year of the war, since itwould be madness to suppose that, with the much smaller number of ports whichwould then be at our disposal, possessing, moreover, a much smaller equipment for discharging cargoes, we should in that event be able no matter how large theamount of our shipping to land in this country the same quantities of goods as ispossible to-day with the East Coast ports still available.30. To&apos;;sum up, it is prudent to assume that, even on the most favourableassumptions&apos;, our shipping difficulties will be substantially increased in the second year of the war. Further, any increase in the scale or direction of our war effortor any large-scale enemy attack on our ports or internal communications or an intensification of the present campaign against our shipping would produce a situation, so far as concerns our capacity to import goods to this country, whichcould only be met by the most drastic and far-reaching cuts in our import programme and in our scales of consumption of all kinds.31. It should be remembered also that, serious as are our present shipping-difficulties, their consequences have been less serious in certain directions(e.g., iron-ore, wheat, sugar) than would otherwise have been the case as theresult of our having decided to meet some of our requirements by drawing uponthe..stocks with which we started the war. In more recent months&quot;efforts have in some cases been made to bring stocks back to higher levels; but it cannot besaid that in general the position as regards stocks has been repaired. In viewof the risks that in the second year of the war our difficulties in bringing imports into this country may be greatly increased, it is essential that the problem of stocks should be kept constantly in mind in the actual application of our import programmes.[20851] I        c
Y. THE METHOD WHICH SHOULD EE FOLLOWED TO ACHIEVEWITH THE LEAST HARM TO OUR GENERAL ECONOMYSUCH REDUCTION IN IMPORTS AS SHIPPING difficulties might AT ANY TIME REQUIRE.32. If the shipping situation were to demand a reduction in our totalimport programme, there could be no question, in view of the recent decision ofthe War Cabinet, of reducing the scale of our war effort; nor, quite apart fromthat decision, should I be prepared to counsel such a course, unless it could beproved beyond all shadow of doubt (which I cannot conceive could be the case)that our existing war effort could only be maintained by reducing the food andother supplies available for the civilian population to so low a- level that thenational power of resistance was seriously undermined. We must realise, how-ever, that a war effort on this scale cannot be achieved unless we, in fact, secure inthe prescribed period the imports of raw materials and finished goods (e.g.,machine tools) required to support it. The Ministry of Supply shipping allocation,which amounts to 23-9 million tons, embraces, in the case of raw materialscontrolled by the Ministry, both the supplies required for the Fighting Servicesand the supplies allocated to the export trade and the home market. In view ofthe present drive to increase our export trade, it is quite clear that the demandsof the Board of Trade for the allocation of raw materials for manufacture forexport will be increased and that no reduction under this head can beanticipated. Indeed, I imagine that it is not unlikely that the President of theBoard of Trade will ask for increased allocations of raw materials to supporthis export drive. Thus, the main possibility of squeezing from the Ministry ofSupply shipping allocation a contribution towards meeting the deficit withwhich we may be faced would be to reduce the quantities^of. rawmaterials at present allocated to the home,., market for domestic con-sum^tion?&apos;&quot;&quot; Tf&apos;&quot;&apos;&apos;&apos;w6uld7&quot;^hibwevef, be a mistake to hope that very substantial reductions in the quantities of raw materials to be importedcan be achieved in this way, since in some at least of the importantraw materials (e.g,, timber) the present allocation for the home market is verysmall as compared with the amounts consumed in that market before the war.The second possibility of securing some contribution from the Ministry of supply programme is the extent to which investigation into (a) thc-present Army scales of initial equipment and (&amp;.) the present wastage rates (W.M. (40) 40th Con-,elusions, Minute 1 (iv)) now in progress at the War Office and the correspondinginvestigations which are being initiated by the First Lord of the admiralty and the Secretary of State for Air in the case of the Navy and the Royal AirForce respectively may show that, without detraction from the present scale ofour war effort, it may be possible to achieve economies of a kind which will resultin some reduction in the amount of raw materials to be imported.33. The maximum reduction which by these means it might be found possibleto secure in the Ministry of Supply&apos;s shipping allocation of 23-9 million tonsmight well fall short of the total reduction of imports necessary. The next itemwhich should, in such circumstances, be examined as rapidly as possible and reduced to the smallest dimensions possible is that of 3-3 million tons which figures in our import programme under the heading &quot;miscellaneous andunallocated items.&quot; This item contains considerable quantities of variousessential supplies which might well have been included in the deparmental programmes.34. Even when the utmost had been secured by these means, we might,however, still be left with a gap between the amount of the imports that we want to bring into this country, and the amount which the shipping at our disposalwould enable us to bring in. The only means which remains to bridge this gapwould be to make a cut in the import programme of the Ministry of Food, whichat present amounts to 19-39 million tons.* In this connexion, it is relevant to recall that in 1917 our retained imports (i) of foodstuffs for human consumption and (ii) of animal feeding stuffs amounted to no more than 13-7 million tons,tthe figures being 10 - 99 million tons and 2 - 67 million tons respectively.* See footnote to paragraph 14.f See Beveridge, British Food Control, pp. 354-358. (The figure here given excludesmolasses because these are now included in the Ministry of Supply programme).
35. The figure of 13-7 million tons for 1917 is comparable with that of19-39 million tons in the present import programme of the Ministry of Food inthe sense that it comprises the same range of commodities; but before anycomparison between the two figures can be made, there are a number of importantadjustments required. For convenience of reference I give as Annex C a comparative statement showing by categories the actual imports of food-stuffsfor human consumption and of animal feeding-stuffs (a) in 1917 and (6) in thelast twelve months of the last war (November 1917-October 1918), (c) the esti-mated imports for the first year of the present war as set out in the Annex to memorandum by the Minister of Food, dated the 20th February, 1940 (paper.P. (G.) (40) 51), (d) the import programme of 19-39 million tons, to which theMinistry of Food have been working since last December, and (e) the averageretained imports in the period 1935-37.36. The first of the adjustments required is, in so far as concerns food-stuffsfor human consumption, to take account of the changes in the size of thepopulation to be fed which have occurred since the last war. These changes areof two kinds operating in opposing directions. First, there has been a substantial increase in population in this country; secondly, owing to the Anglo-Irish Treatyof 1922, by which Southern Ireland ceased to be part of the United Kingdom, itis necessary to take account of the fact that the imported food and feeding-stuffrequirements of the inhabitants of the 26 counties no longer have to be derivedfrom the retained imports of the United Kingdom. On balance, we should beon the safe side if we were to make a 4 per cent, increase in the import figures of1917 in order to render them comparable; but before this addition is made it isnecessary to subtract the amount of industrial raw materials included in the 1917figures, as explained in paragraph 39 below.37. The actual bulk of food consumed has not greatly increased since 1917,but its character has radically altered. Far more is now consumed in the form of meat, bacon, eggs and dairy produce, and fruit than was then the case. In part,this has required larger imports of these commodities, but it has largely been achieved by greatly increased imports of feeding-stuffs which are converted intothe more concentrated foods within Great Britain. This change has been particularly noticeable in the case of the home output of pig and poultry products,both of which have increased over 80 per cent, compared with 1917. It must berealised, therefore, that if imports of animal feeding-stuffs were to be reduced tothe 1917 standard, we should be quite unable to support our present animalpopulation, and there would be no alternative but a resort to slaughtering on an extensive scale. Such a policy would involve making a draft upon our nationalcapital resources similar in character to that involved in the financing of part ofour war effort by the progressive utilisation of our gold, foreign exchange, andother foreign assets. We are already faced with the need to draw on our nationalcapital resources in the latter ease, and shipping difficulties might well force usto make a similar sacrifice in the case of our animal population.38. Thirdly, it is necessary to realise that, since 1917, there has been adecline of 2 - 852 million acres in the land under arable cultivation, the total havingfallen from 14-868 million acres to 12-016 million acres in 1937 (the latest year for which the figures for Great Britain as a whole are available. Of this decline,by far the greater part (2-198 million acres) is due to the fall in acreage undercorn production, which has fallen from 7-308 million acres to 5-110 million acres.If the home production of food-stuffs for human and animal consumption were now to be brought up to the 1917 standard, it would be necessary to increase the acreage under arable cultivation to the 1917 level, adjusted to take account of the4 per cent, increase in the population which has occurred since the last war. Inother words, the total acreage would need to be increased to 15 - 463 million acres.This would represent an increase of 3 - 447 million acres as compared with theposition in 1937. We have already approved a large programme for the ploughing-up of land which, since the last war has gone out of arable cultivation,and have decided in other ways also to increase the production of home-grownfood. The shipping difficulties now under consideration emphasise very clearlyhow essential it is that this part of our programme should be fully achieved.39. Fourthly, it is necessary to take note of the fact that the figure of13-7 million tons given above as the total imports of food and animal feeding-[20851] c 2
stuffs in 1917 included in the items for fats and oils not only the quantitiesrequired (a) for human consumption, and (b) for consumption by the animalpopulation, but also (c) such quantities of those commodities as were requiredfor industrial purposes. The amount involved was in that year 150,000 tons.The make-up of the present import programme of the Ministry of Food iscomparable with that on which the figure for 1917 has been compiled; and theamount included for industrial purposes is now 540,000 tons. The industrialuse of these oils and fats has therefore increased nearly fourfold since the last war. The extent to which it would be possible to reduce the industrial use ofthese oils and fats from their present level to that obtaining in 1917 involves amore complicated study than it has been possible for me to make at the time at my disposal. It is sufficient, however, to note that it would not be possible toreduce imports for these purposes fully to the level of 1917.40. The foregoing analysis may be summed up by saying that, if we were forced by shipping difficulties to reduce the imports (i) of food-stuffs for human consumption to a level equivalent to that of 1917 (adjusted to take account of theincrease in population since that date), and (ii) of animal feeding-stuffs to a levelequivalent to that of 1917, we should be faced with the need : (a) to achieve an increase in our arable cultivation by over 3 million acresas compared with the position in 1937, i.e., to do considerably morethan is contemplated in our present ploughing-up programme;(b) to reduce our present animal population by very heavy slaughtering;(c) to reduce consumption of food by the population to the 1917 standardboth as regards quantity and character.Assuming (i) that we had, in fact, secured so large an increase in the home-grown production of food for human consumption, and (ii) that we were preparedto sacrifice our animal population to the extent necessary, it would be possible toreduce imports of food-stuffs for human and animal consumption from19-39 million tons (the present Ministry of Food programme) to 14-21 million tons, thereby securing a reduction in such imports of 5 -18 million tons per annum.41. The way in which this reduction would be effected if we were to revertfully to the 1917 standard would be as follows :  Imports of Food and Animal Feeding-stuffs.(Millions of tons.)	Food for human eon-sumption.	Animal feeding-stuffs.	Industrial raw materials (oils and fats).	Total.1939 (Ministry of Food programme) 1917 (adjusted to take account of the 4 per cent, increase in the population since 1917) Excess of 1939 programme over 1917 standard	13-71 11-25	5-14 2-81	,54 -15	19-39 14-21	2-46	2-33	- 39             5-18	42. I do not suggest that an immediate reduction of imports of humanfood and animal feeding-stuffs on the foregoing scale is either practicable or desirable. It is clear, however, that the scale of human food consumptioncontemplated in the present import programme is much higher than that whichwe were forced to adopt at the end of the last war, and therefore that there is aconsiderable margin on the present programme from which, if necessary, cutscould be made. The extent to which any reduction we may be forced to makeshould be secured at the expense of imports of food for human consumption orof those of animal feeding-stuffs is a highly intricate problem which wouldrequire the most careful examination before a decision was taken.
43. To sum up, if shipping difficulties were to make it necessary to reduce our total import programme, the reduction should be secured from the followingsources : (1) any reductions in the requirements of the Fighting Services shown to bepossible, without detriment to the scale of our war effort, by thepresent investigations into their scales of equipment and maintenance;(2) a drastic reduction in the allocation of imported raw materials for civilian consumption in the home market;(3) all possible reductions in the item in our import programme which appear under the heading &quot; Miscellaneous and unallocated items &quot; ;(4) reduction in the imports of : (a) food for human consumption,(6) animal feeding stuffs,included in the Ministry of Food&apos;s import programme to such extent as may be necessary and in such proportions as, after expert examina-tion of the problem, may appear least harmful to our general economy.YI. ACTION RECOMMENDED.(a) The import programme for the first year of the war.44. In his Memorandum of the 7th February, 1940 (Paper W.P. (G.)(40) 42), the Minister of Shipping expressed the opinion &quot; that it might be justifiable to retain for the present the provisional allocations of tonnage towhich the Ministry of Shipping has been working for the Ministry of Food andthe Ministry of Supply,&quot; but strongly urged &quot; that the Departments, in planningtheir programmes of importation and allocation, should arrange for consumptionon a basis which is less than that of the provisional figures by at least 10 percent., and if possible by a larger proportion, so that if, as is probable, importationsfall substantially below the provisional figures, there may be no diminution inessential stocks, and if the importations for a time approach those figures, suchstocks may be increased against the hazards of the future.&quot;45. In view of the fact that the present programmes include only theminimum quantities which we have so far regarded as essential to meet our war-time needs, it seems to me too much to hope that by administrative action theMinistry of Supply and the Ministry of Food can arrange for a cut in con-sumption of 10 per cent, or more in the absence of definite instructions by theWar Cabinet that import programmes are to be reduced.46. It is certain that, with the information at present at their disposal,the War Cabinet are not in a position to determine what are the cuts in our import programme which are required immediately. I accordingly recommendthat as a preliminary step the whole of the import programme of 47 million tons for the first year of the war should at once be reviewed, on the lines indicated inparagraphs 32 to 43 above, in sufficient detail to enable the War Cabinet to decide how it could be reduced to such extent as our shipping difficulties may rendernecessary, without weakening the scale of our war effort and with the least possibleinjury to our general economy. This investigation would necessarily involve an examination both of our current standards of consumption and of the adequacy or otherwise of our stocks of vital raw materials and food-stuffs. It should, Ithink, be possible to produce quite quickly a first approximation sufficientlyaccurate to enable the War Cabinet to reach a definite decision without further delay.47. It should be possible, as more information becomes available regardingthe nature of the imports actually received, to build up a more accurate forecast of our total imports for the first year of the war; and, in view of the constantchanges to which the shipping situation is necessarily subject, I recommend thatthe whole question should be kept under constant review, and that periodical reports on it should be submitted to the War Cabinet in the same way as we haveagreed should be done in the case of the balance of payments.
(b) The basis to be adopted in the preparation of the import programme&apos;-forthe second year of the war.48. For the reasons which I have explained, I have no doubt that in thesecond year of the war our shipping difficulties will be considerably greater thanthey are at present. It is therefore, in my view, most important that we should secure as soon as possible a provisional estimate of the total import programme for the second year of the war. If our shipping difficulties were by any chance to become less acute, the Departments would have no difficulty in indicating thenature of the further supplies which they desired to import; but, if, on theother hand, the shipping situation were still further to deteriorate, it wouldbe a matter of the greatest difficulty for the War Cabinet to decide at short notice in what directions further cuts should be made, whether in the Ministryof Supply programme, or in that of the Ministry of Food.49. What in effect we require is to be forearmed against a contingencywhich we hope will never arise, but the possibility of which we cannot afford to ignore. The allocations to be made in the import programme for the second year of the war as between the Ministry of Supply and the Ministry of Food pro-. grammes will in any case be a matter of considerable difficulty in view of theincreased needs of the Supply programme which will be inevitable as the Armyexpansion programme is gradually achieved. I suggest therefore that we should now arrange for the preparation of an estimate giving a provisional allocationbetween the requirements of those two Departments on the hypothesis that inthe second year of the war our capacity to import goods may be seriously curtailed.I think that the same opportunity should be taken to prepare an alternativeestimate on a substantially more unfavourable assumption, namely, that theunpredictable adverse factors referred to in paragraphs 27 to 33 above may create a situation in which it will only be possible for us during the second year of thewar to import a substantially smaller amount of goods than that foreseen in thefirst of the estimates of imports for that year which I suggest should now beprepared.50. In each case, the estimate would need to show the extent of the cut in home consumption involved, and for this purpose a direct comparison (adjusted to take account of the difference in the size of the population to-day as comparedwith that in 1917-18) should be made to show the sacrifices which we may now becalled upon to make as contrasted with those which we made in the last year of the Great War.
YI. SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS ANDRECOMMENDATIONS.(A) PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS.51.   I summarise my principal conclusions as follows: (a) The British shipping available in the first year of the war for bringingimports to the United Kingdom other than oil amounts to 9-467 million grosstons with a deadweight capacity of 13-190 million tons, and, after deductionshave been made in respect of bunkers and other allowances, a cargo-carrying capacity of 10 - 650 million tons; (paragraphs 3 and 4)(b) The Ministry of Shipping estimate that on the basis of the present andcontemplated sources of supply it should be possible in the first year of the warwith the foregoing quantity of British merchant shipping for us to import32 - 7 million tons of the goods which we require from the countries where they areproduced or the countries from which we buy them as the case may be;(paragraphs 5-13)(c) Exclusive of 43,000 gross tons of foreign vessels under time-charter in use by the Fighting Services and therefore not available for importing goods intothe United Kingdom, arrangements have been made for the time-chartering of235,000 gross tons of neutral vessels of which 138,000 gross tons have already been delivered. The deadweight capacity of these vessels amounts to 397,000 tons;and in existing conditions this tonnage should be capable of importingapproximately 1-25 million tons of goods in the course of the year. There is reason to hope that during the last six months (March to August 1940)of the first year of the war, it will be possible considerably to increase the amountof neutral tonnage now under time-charter; (paragraphs 15, 16 and 19)(d) In the first five months of the war (September 1939 to January 1940)imports to this country in foreign vessels (including both those under time-charter and those trading to this country independently) amounted to 4 million tons.Thus, during these five months, imports were arriving in foreign vessels at the rateof 9-6 million tons per annum. The Ministry of Shipping hope that it may bepossible in the first year of the war to secure a larger quantity of imports invessels now under foreign flags. In view of the rate at which imports in foreignvessels have been arriving since the beginning of the war, it seems to me not unreasonable to assume that such imports are not likely to amount to less than9 million tons nor to more than 12 million tons in the first year of the war;(paragraph 20)(e) We do not possess to-day the same means for coercing neutrals to bringimports to this country as we had at our disposal during the last war; but weshould make the fullest use of such means as we do possess to secure this end;we must realise however that the time-chartering of neutral tonnage only increasesour capacity to import, where the tonnage so chartered is tonnage which, if notchartered, would not come to United Kingdom ports at all; moreover, the questionof neutral tonnage cannot be looked upon from a purely United Kingdom angle,since it has been agreed that neutral tonnage time-chartered by ourselves and
by the French should constitute a pool to be drawn upon in such proportionsas circumstances may from time to time show to be desirable in the common interests of the Allied cause; it may therefore happen that the pool of neutral shipping from which we may hope to take vessels on time-charter will be reduced on this account; (paragraphs 17 and 18)(f) It is naturally impossible for the Ministry of Shipping, at so early a stage and with so many variable factors involved, to commit themselves to adefinite estimate of the total amount of goods (other than oil) which we shall beable to import in the first year of the war; but if we succeed in importing inBritish vessels 32-7 million tons (the figure given in Conclusion (b) above), andif the amount to be imported in vessels now under foreign flags is taken as lyingbetween 9 million tons and 12 million tons we find that the position is as follows: Million tons.To be imported in British vessels   ...      ...      ... 32-7To be imported in foreign vessels ...      ...      . 9-1241-7-44-7(paragraph 21)(g) The import programme (exclusive of oil imports), approved for the first year of the war before the magnetic mine campaign and the later attacks on shipping from the air (both of which developments acted as serious deterrentswith the neutrals) was subdivided as follows: Million tons.Commodities controlled by Ministry of Food ... 19 - 809Commodities specifically covered by Ministry ofSupply programme, including molasses ... 23 - 900Miscellaneous ana unallocated items      ... ... 3-30047 000(paragraph 14)(h) We are thus faced with the problem that, whereas we have set ourselves to import 47 million tons of goods in the first year of the war, the shipping a tour disposal, whether British or foreign, may only suffice to import between41-7 and 44-7 million tons. In other words our actual imports in that periodof goods (other than oil) may fall short by from 2-3 to 5-3 million tons of theamount which we have so far considered as being essential to secure the threefoldobjective which we have so far pursued, namely: (i) the achievement of our war effort on the scale which we have setourselves, on the maintenance of which the War Cabinet agreed attheir meeting held on the 13th February, 1940:(W.M. (40) 40th Conclusions, Minute 1)(ii) the maintenance of a substantial export trade;(iii) the maintenance of civil consumption at approximately its present level; (paragraph 22)(i) Any attempt to deal with this problem in a piece-meal fashion wouldnot only be foredoomed to failure but would also aggravate the difficulties inwhich we find ourselves; the problem is, however, exceedingly urgent since withthe passage of every day the likelihood grows that some of the imports which
are arriving are imports which in the last resort we could do without, with theresult that at the end of the first year of the war we may find that we have failedto obtain imports which are absolutely vital to our war effort;(paragraphs 23 and 24)(j) It is almost certain that with only six months of the first year of thewar left to run we shall not be able fully to secure that the imports actuallyreceived in that period are those which we most urgently require. We shall,therefore, start the second year of the war with an unbalanced import programme which will necessarily include considerable quantities of essential goods whichwere required for our war effort in the first year of the war, but which we were unable to import in that period since the shipping space required for such imports was used to carry to this country goods of less essential (or, in some cases, of anon-essential) character ; (paragraph 25)(k) It is likely that, even when account is taken of our present merchantship building programme, our shipping difficulties, like our exchange difficulties,will be greater in the second year than in the first, and will continue to increase for so long as the war continues (paragraph 25). The considerations pointingto this conclusion include the following: (i) it is impossible to doubt that once active military operations arebegun, the essential requirements of the Fighting Services will resultin greatly increased demands for the import of raw materials, andconsequently in substantial demands for additional shipping space;(paragraph 26)(ii) the outbreak of active military operations may be expected to create an increased demand by the Army for merchant tonnage to maintain our Army in France, and this demand will be further increased ifwe then strive to increase the size of our forces on the Western Front;(paragraph 28)(iii) it would not be safe to ignore the possibility that we may becomeengaged in military operations on other Fronts, since, if that were to happen, very large amounts of British merchant tonnage at present engaged in bringing imports into this country would have to be diverted at short notice and for an indefinite period to purely military purposes; (paragraph 28)(iv) simultaneously with the emergence of the new demands referred toabove, we might suffer for a time at least increased lossesthrough the intensification of the efforts of the enemy both by navaland air action to destroy our shipping. The loss so sustained would almost certainly be aggravated by further injury to our importing capacity consequent on air attack on our ports and inlandcommunications; (paragraphs 27 and 29)(v) our capacity to import goods from abroad would be further seriouslyimpaired if by reason of enemy pressure we were forced to divert alarge part, if not the whole, of our seaborne trade from Bast Coastto West Coast ports; (paragraph 29)(vi) in the second year of the war it will not be possible to avoid some ofthe consequences of our shipping difficulties (as we have done duringthe present year) by drawing upon accumulated stocks of raw[20851] D
materials and food-stuffs, since the position as regards stocks, thoughbetter than a short while ago, cannot be said to have been repaired.(paragraph 31)(1) If the shipping situation were to demand a reduction in our total import programme, the extent to which it is possible to reduce the Ministry of Supply&apos;sshipping allocation is limited to: (i) any reductions which can be secured in the amount of raw materials to be imported, through far-reaching reduction in the amount allocated to the home market for domestic consumption since: (1) (subject to (ii) below) any reduction in the programme forthe Fighting Services would involve a diminution in thescale of our war effort, a course which I could not recommend;  and(2) any reduction in the present scale of allocation of rawmaterials for manufacture for export would be whollyinconsistent with the present drive to increase our exporttrade;(ii) any reductions which may be found possible as the result of the investigations now in progress in the case of the Army in regard to : (1) the scales of initial equipment;(2) the present wastage rates;and the corresponding investigations in progress in the case of theNavy and the Royal Air Force; (paragraph 32)(m) The next item which should in such circumstances be examined as rapidly as possible and reduced to the smallest dimensions possible is that of3-3 million tons which figures in our import programme under the heading&quot;miscellaneous and unallocated items.&quot; This item contains considerable quantities of essential supplies which might well have been included in theDepartmental programmes ; (paragraph 33)(n) Even when the utmost had been secured by these means we might,however, still be left with a gap between the amount of the imports that we want to bring into this country and the amount which the shipping at our disposalwould enable us to bring in. The only means which remains to bridge this gapwould be to make a cut in the import programme of the Ministry of Food, whichat present amounts to 19 39 million tons; it is relevant to recall that our importsof food-stuffs in 1917 amounted to no more than 13-7 million tons, and that, even after allowance had been made for the increase in the size of our populationsince that date, the equivalent figure to-day would be only 14-2 million tons.Thus, if we were forced by shipping difficulties to reduce the imports (i) of food-stuffs for human consumption to a level equivalent to that of 1917 (adjusted totake account of the increase in population since that date), and (ii) of animal feeding-stuffs to a level equivalent to that of 1917, we should be faced with theneed: (a) to achieve an increase in our arable cultivation by over 3 million acresas compared with the position in 1937, i.e., to do considerably morethan is contemplated in our present ploughing-up programme;(b) to reduce our present animal population by very heavy slaughtering;(c) to reduce consumption of food by the population to the 1917 standardboth as regards quantity and character.
Assuming (1) that we had, in fact, secured so large an increase in the home-grownproduction of food for human consumption, (2) that we were prepared to sacrifice our animal population to the extent necessary, it would be possible toreduce imports of food-stuffs for human and animal consumption from 19 39million tons (the present Ministry of Food programme) to 14 21 million tons,thereby securing a reduction in such imports of 5 18 million tons per annum.I do not suggest that an immediate reduction of imports of human food andanimal feeding-stuffs on the foregoing scale is either practicable or desirable. Itis clear, however, that the scale of human food consumption contemplated in thepresent import programme is much higher than that which we were forced toadopt at the end of the last war, and therefore that there is a considerable marginon the present programme from which, if necessary, cuts could be made. Theextent to which any reduction we may be forced to make should be secured at theexpense of imports of food for human consumption or of those of animal feeding-stuffs is a highly intricate problem which would require the most careful examina-tion before a decision was taken; (paragraphs 34-42)(o) To sum up, if shipping difficulties were to make it necessary to reduce our total import programme, the reduction should be secured from the followingsources: (1) any reductions in the requirements of the Fighting Services shown tobe possible, without detriment to the scale of our war effort, by thepresent investigations into their scales of equipment and maintenance;(2) a drastic reduction in the allocation of imported raw materials for civilian consumption in the home market;(3) all possible economies in the item in our import programme which appears under the heading &quot; Miscellaneous and unallocated items &quot; ;(4) reduction in the imports of: (a) food for human consumption;(b) animal feeding-stuffs,included in the Ministry of Food&apos;s import programme to such extent as may be necessary and in such proportions as, after expert examina-tion of the problem, may appear least harmful to our general economy.(paragraph 43)(B) RECOMMENDATIONS.52. I submit the following recommendations for the consideration of theWar Cabinet: (a) that as a preliminary step the whole of the import programme of47 million tons for the first year of the war should at once be reviewed on thelines indicated in paragraph 51 (1) to (o) above in sufficient detail to enable theWar Cabinet to decide how it could be reduced to such extent as our shipping difficulties may render necessary without weakening the scale of our war effort and with the least possible injury to our general economy;Note. This investigation, which would necessarily involve an examinationboth of current standards of consumption and of the adequacy orotherwise of our stocks of vital raiv materials and food-stuffs, is onewhich it should be possible to carry out quite quickly with sufficientaccuracy to enable the War Cabinet to reach a definite decision withoutfurther delay; (paragraph 46)[20851] d 2
(b) that in view of the constant changes to which the shipping situationis subject, our import programme for the first year of the war should be kept under constant review during the next six months, and that periodical reports on it should be submitted to the War Cabinet in the same way as we have agreed should be done in the case of the balance of payments; (paragraph 47)(c) that as regards the second year of the war, steps should be taken atonce to prepare for the consideration of the War Cabinet an estimate giving a provisional allocation between the requirements of the Ministry of Supply andthe Ministry of Food on the hypothesis that in that year our capacity to importmay be seriously curtailed; (paragraph 49)(d) that simultaneously with the preparation of the estimate recommended in (c) above, there should be prepared also an alternative estimate on a substantially more unfavourable assumption, namely, that the unpredictableadverse factors enumerated in paragraph 51 (k) above, may create a situationin which it will only be possible for us to import a substantially smaller amountof goods than that foreseen in the estimate, the preparation of which is recom-mended in (c) above; (paragraph 49)(e) that the estimates referred to in (c) and (d) above should show theextent of the cut in home consumption involved, and for this purpose a directcomparison (adjusted to take account of the difference in the size of thepopulation to-day as compared with that in 1917-18) should be made to show the sacrifices which we may now be called upon to make as contrasted with thosewhich we made in the last year of the Great War.
