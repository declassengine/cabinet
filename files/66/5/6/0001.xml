Introductory.THE Danube froze with the advent of the New Year. Through navigation-between Roumania and Germany has ceased for a period of weeks or months.The Danube is so important a factor in Germany&apos;s oil position that the moment is opportune for a fresh stocktaking of the position on. the oil front of economic warfare, which was reviewed in our Report of the 20th November, 1939(W.P. (39) 134).2. We have accordingly prepared for the information of the War cabinet a fresh review of the subject in consultation with the Minister for economic warfare, the Secretary for Mines and representatives of the Treasury andForeign Office. We have also had the advantage of the co-operation ofLord Cadman, and have received invaluable assistance from Mr. Bridgeman, the oil Adviser of the Ministry of Economic Warfare, and Mr. Hall-Patch, whorecently returned from a visit to Roumania. We have adopted many of their suggestions.3. We have no reason to be dissatisfied with the campaign up to date.evidence ence will be found in Section III of this Report to show that the GermanGovernment must be anxious about the future of their oil supplies. But in warone can never stand still. Germany is undoubtedly hatching new plans toimprove her position, and in the Spring the conditions may be less unfavourable to her. In re-examining the position, therefore, we have given careful considera-tion to the means by which we can best promote the Governments policy of limiting Germany&apos;s oil supplies as much as possible.4.   Germany&apos;s supplies must come from the following sources : (1) Internal.(2^ Overseas--by evasion of contraband control.(3) Overland Roumania or Russia.AH these sources were examined in our last report.[20668] u
5. Germany&apos;s&apos; internal stocks and sources of supply of oil, which were estimated by Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd&apos;s Committee to produce 2,400,000 tons of oil in 1940, can only be reduced by offensive air action, and that is debarred for thepresent by War Cabinet decisions which we do not wish to challenge. any means, however, by which in the present phase of the war Germany can be compelled to use more petroleum products than at present would be welcome astending to increase her difficulties.6. So far as importation by sea is concerned, the interception of oil dependsin the first instance on the success of the naval patrols maintained by theAdmiralty, the efficiency of which has considerably improved in the Mecliterra-nean area, to which we referred in our last Report.7. The efficiency of the contraband control system, both on the control andin the Ministry of Economic Warfare itself, is also increasing with experience,and neutral importers, to an ever-increasing extent, are availing themselves of thefacilities offered for speeding up the release of innocuous cargoes, such as navi-certs and advance submission of manifests.8. The intelligence system of the Ministry of Economic Warfare is alsorapidly improving. Statistics of the oil situation in most of the countriesadjacent to Germany are coming forward well, and from these and from a variety of other sources of information, periodical studies of the position in each country are prepared and circulated to all concerned.9. With these improvements in the working of the systems of patrol andcontraband control and intelligence, there has been a gradual reduction in theamount of oil believed to be reaching Germany from overseas through neighbouring countries, which is now estimated by the Ministry of Economic Warfare to benot much greater than 10,000 tons a month (Appendix, Paragraph 9).10. Not more than 9,000 tons of oil (fuel oil from stocks at Leningrad) are believed to have reached Germany from Russia up to the end of 1939. A beginningwas made at the outset of the present year to send fuel oil from Baku via Odessa,but at the time this Report was produced it was said to be still held up on thePolish railways. Roumania, however, is by far the largest external source of oilfor Germany, and is estimated to furnish nearly 80 per cent, of her imports. to roumania, therefore, Ave devote the greater part of this Report.II. -Roumania as a Source of Sup-ply.11. The War Cabinefs policy for preventing Roumanian oil supplies from reaching Germany may be summed up as follows : (a) To buy as much Roumanian oil as possible (War Cabinet 13 (39), Comelusion 10, of the 12th September, 1939).(b) To aim at preventing Germany from obtaining from Roumania morethan 1 million tons a year, that is to say, a quarter of a million tonsless than the figure for the last year (War Cabinet 85 (39), Conelmsion 12, of the 16th November, 1939).(c) To purchase or charter means of oil transport such as barges, tugs and railway oil tanks. (War Cabinet 13 (39), Conclusion 10 (V) and85 (69), Conclusion 11.)12. At the time of our last Report the policy of purchase of oil was notproceeding so successfully as we could wish. This was due partly to financialand partly to political causes. To overcome these difficulties we had arranged with the Departments concerned that Mr. Bridgeman and Mr. Hall-Patch should proceed on a temporary Mission to Bucharest with the following instructions:  (a) To reduce to the lowest practicable figure the quantity of oil that germany could obtain from Roumania, and in pursuance of this object to procure the purchase for the account of this country of the maximum amount of oil on the most reasonable terms possible;(b) to elicit an immediate reply to the proposals already made, which had as their object the stimulation of Roumanian oil exports to this countrvand to recommend how these proposals should be modified to obtainsatisfactory results.
3*1We also arranged that this Mission should be followed as soon as possible by anofficial (Mr. Berthoud), who would be attached permanently to the Legation atBucharest, as representative of the Ministry of Economic Warfare and the MinesDepartment to arrange and co-ordinate the future purchases of oil.13. Mr. Bridgeman and Mr. Hall-Patch encountered great difficulties.Their arrival was anticipated by a day of two by that of Dr. Clodius, a Germanrepresentative, who was putting the greatest pressure on the Roumanian Govern-in ent during their visit. Two days after their arrival the Roumanian Govern-ment fell. The new Minister of National Economy was ignorant of the oilquestion. A reshuffle of officials had taken place. One of the new officials wasnot conversant with the subject, while the other, a discharged employe of an oil company, was believed to have German associations. Our Mission gainedthe impression that the Roumanian Government had no intention of entering into any constructive arrangement with Great Britain until the German negotia-tions had been concluded. The Roumanian officials threatened to impose a systemof oil quotas, and intimated that, in order to avoid conflict with that system,approval would not be granted for long-term contracts, and in which it was proposed to divert from Germany the entire exportable supplies of certainproducers for the whole of 1940. The Roumanian authorities also refused export licences for contracts already entered into, sometimes with the general approvalof the Roumanian Government.14. The Roumanian proposal to establish quotas is particularly objectionableas it might virtually guarantee to Germany shipments in excess of 1 million tons per annum, and gravely interfere with the War Cabinefs policy of limitingGermany&apos;s supplies by prior purchase.15. Equally objectionable from our point of view is the possibility thatthe Roumanian Government might withhold approval to long-term contracts.At an earlier stage the Roumanian Government had encouraged the Britishand French Governments to promote the purchase of Roumanian produce, andthe long-term contracts for oil were being negotiated with that object, whichharmonised admirably with our policy of denying Roumanian oil to Germany.The Mines Department, working with Mr. Kessler of the Asiatic petroleum company (Shell Group) have established close relations with the British and american Companies,* and have encouraged them to enter into such contracts,several of which are now being presented to the Roumanian Government. close contact has been maintained with the French Government which is dealing with french Companies operating in Roumania on co-ordinated lines. these companies, which have embarked a large amount of capital in the developmentof the Roumanian oil industry are, in our view, entitled to sell produce of theirown wells and refineries, and any oil which they have acquired from otherproducers, where they wish, and must not be subject to coercion from theRoumanian Government to sell their oil to Germany.16. The refusal of export licences for contracts already entered into isobjected to for much the same reasons. It is characteristic of the difficulty of doing business in Roumania that an application by the members of our mission to various Roumanian officials produced a different reason in each case for the note. The companies referred to are the following:AnnualRemarks.Tons.Astra liomana     ...       ...       1,461,080       Subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell.Romano-Americana        ... 900,369       Subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey.Concordia ...       ...       ... 852,735       Controlled by Petrofina Bdge,  of which m. Wengei is Managing Director.Steaua Romana   ...       ... 740,162       51 per cent. Roumanian, remainder Britishand French in equal proportions.Unirea      ...       ...       ... 640,214       British Group associated with Phoenix Oiland Transport Company,Colomhia   ...       ...       ... 423,011       French Group associated  with DesmaianFreres.76 per cent, of the Roumanian production and 67-8 per cent, of the exports are in the handsof the above six companies, all of which have a large proportion of foreign capital.[20668] b 2
refusal of these licences : also that the Constanza authorities, having been notified of the approval of the contract, but not of the refusal of the licence for individualcargoes, had already authorised shipment.17. The British Mission, who were in daily touch with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, strongly resisted these impositions by the Roumanian authorities.On the 5th December His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Bucharest approached thePresident of the Council and obtained, both from him and from the Ministerof National Economy, an assurance that no quota system had been approvedby the Government. Officially that is still the position. But from conversations with Government officials it was, nevertheless, apparent that such a scheme wasunder active consideration; and since the return of Mr. Briclgeman andMr. Hall-Patch, Sir Reginald Hoare has reported that, in spite of the denialsof the President of the Council and the Minister of National Economy, he is convinced that the proposal is still under very serious consideration^18. In these circumstances there was clearly no justification for proposingan amelioration of the Payments Agreement in favour of Roumania, as had been contemplated at the time of the Mission&apos;s departure from London, and no such proposal was made. We feel that we should, if possible, proceed warily in offeringthe Roumanian Government financial inducement in the way of free exchange asagainst promises not to impede our shipments of oil. Otherwise we may find ourselves paying hard cash for promises which may not be fulfilled.19. Meanwhile Dr. Clodius had been conducting negotiations under diffi-culties due to Roumanian conditions, which cannot have been much less than ourown. But he had one great political advantage in the fact that, since the Russianinvasion of Finland, the Roumanians have become more than ever terrified of a russian invasion of Bessarabia, if not of other parts of their country. Armsthey must have, from Germany if not from elsewhere. The Germans, now inpossession of much loot from Poland, as well as of the armaments industry ofCzecho-Slovakia, offered to supply Roumania&apos;s needs in return for oil a form of competition in which we are bound to come off worst. As recently as the5th January the Roumanian Minister in London approached the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence on this subject and communicated to him a personalappeal by the Prime Minister of Roumania for anti-aircraft guns and machine guns, anti-tank guns and anti-tank rifles in considerable numbers, though eventoken deliveries, he said, would have an excellent effect in Roumania as a sign ofBritish goodwill. Lord Chatfield, however, had no alternative but to inform theMinister frankly of the position and of our inability to meet the Roumanianrequirements owing to our own insistent needs. In doing so, however, he explainedthat we had every wish to help the Roumanian Government, particularly in viewof the assurances we had given that country in the event of an attack, and thatwe much regretted not to be able to give more liberal assistance. In spite of ourdeficiencies in this respect, however, we possess important counter-advantages inour superior financial resources, greater share-holding control of RoumanianCompanies, ability to supply raw materials and capacity to foster neutral oiimarkets to Roumania&apos;s advantage.20. The German demand took the form of an insistence on a revaluation ofthe Reichsmark in terms of the leu, which would enable Germany to receive moreoil in return for a specified number of guns and aeroplanes. The demand wasresisted for a considerable time by the Roumanian Government, but the pressure of their own fears became too great. Eventually an agreement was reached underwhich the exchange value of the Reichsmark was increased for most commodities from 41 lei to 49-50 lei, but in the case of petroleum products to 44-75 only.As part of the bargain, Germany has been given a quota of about 1,300,000 tons to1,500,000 tons of petroleum products per annum, partly through the RoumanianClearing and partly in exchange for armaments. The precise nature of the promise is not, however, clear.  In particular, it is not known whether the quota* The attitude of the Ro umanian Government continues to be very unhelpful. As recently as 19th January we learnt that the long-term contracts had been refused by the roumanian government ; and, according to press reports, a Roumanian Oil Controller is to be appointedwhose mission we suspect will be to ensure that Germany obtains whatever supplies of oil theRoumanian Government have promised.
represents a ceiling, as has been suggested on the Roumanian side, or whether it represents a figure of oil supplies which the Roumanian Government are goingto help the Germans to get.21. We see no reason to modify our policy because of this agreement. Inthe case of Roumania, it is one thing to make an agreement and another toget it carried out in the face of an active opposition such as we propose below.Even in favourable conditions it would not be easy for the Germans to trans-port some 1,300,000 tons from Roumania to Germany by rail and river, as thiswas all they succeeded in securing during 1939 when sea transport was open for eight months. But the conditions will not be favourable. They will meet with strong opposition from the Allies, who will employ all kinds of opportunisttactics for this purpose.22. Good progress has been made in acquiring river transport on the danube.   By the end of the year the position was as follows :  Barges.     Tank barges.      Tugs.Chartered or purchased 96 25 27Under negotiation     ... 9 2 3Total        ...... 105 27 30Total of vessels on theLower Danube        ... 669 112 148The chartered tugs include some of the most modern and powerful on theriver. In addition, few, if any, of the Erench barges are carrying on tradewith Germany, and there are 8 tank barges not included in the above figures which are employed by the Royal Dutch-Shell group.23. In re-examining the question, we set ourselves to devise means by whichwe could frustrate the German plans and promote the War Cabinet&apos;s policy.Our conclusions and recommendations are as follows :  Opposition to Quotas.(1) The application of a quota system to Roumanian oil supplies is opento strong objection and must be resisted. It would seriously hamperour policy of preventing the export of petroleum products to germany by purchase and might virtually guarantee to Germany shipmentsin excess of 1,000,000 tons per annum. Any idea of fixing a Franco-British quota of 2,000,000 tons by direct or indirect means is equallyunacceptable. The objections to a Government monopoly of petroleumexports are even stronger, inasmuch as this would deprive Britainand France of the advantage they possess in the capital control ofand influence with various important companies.Freedom from Control for Friendly Companies.(2) It is even more important to resist any attempt by the Roumanian Govern-ment to force Companies under British or French capital control, orunder American capital control if their co-operation could be secured, tosell their oil to quarters objected to by the Companies concerned.Freedom of export at fair commercial prices must be the objective.Continuation of the Policy of Purchase.(3) The policy of purchases as hitherto pursued should continue inco-operation with the French. It should be possible to maintain thepolicy of effecting purchases from some of the purely RoumanianCompanies and smaller concerns.Maintenance of Normal Sales to the Balkans and Mediterranean.(4) (a) The efforts being made to maintain normal Roumanian markets inthe Balkans and Mediterranean should be encouraged, even if oil hasto be sold at a loss. This factor in our policy can be stressed withthe Roumanian Government, which is anxious to preserve its usualmarkets.
(b) The Committee took note that the Treasury saw no objection, mprinciple, to meeting this loss, and the Treasury and. Mines Depart-ment were invited to work out the details of how this loss could best be met.(c) The Committee took note that the Secretary for Mines agreed to theabove-mentioned loss being a charge on the Mines Department Vote.(d) The Ministry of Economic Warfare were requested to keep in mind thepossibility lest Roumanian oil sold to neutral Powers should be passed on by them to Germany.Hammering Germany&apos;s Transport Facilities.(5) Strong efforts are, and must continue to be made, against Germantransport facilities on the Danube and the railways.Policy in the Immediate Future.(6) (a) There is no occasion to play all our cards yet. If, in the Spring of1940, Roumania is not overrun by either Germany or Russia we could use them to their maximum effect. In the meantime it would be prudent not to dissipate our resources by financial or other douceursto Roumania except in return for realisable concessions which willdefinitely help us to achieve our main object.(b) Any promises which we extract from Roumania are unlikely to have any binding force when increased pressure is applied by eitherGermany or Russia if Roumania, at the time of increased pressure,still feels too weak to offer any effective resistance. If we make concessions in return for premises, and not in return for effectivedeliveries of the products we seek, we shall make a very bad bargain.(c) With the freezing of the Danube and with the present great difficultiesof transport by rail, Germany will be unable to take delivery duringthe winter of anything approaching the proportion of the amountsmade available to her under the new German-Roumanian Agreement.In the spring, the situation will alter in her favour. In the intervening weeks, we should, therefore, employ opportunist tacticsto hamper the Germans wherever and whenever possible, and make all necessary preparations to employ to the full the weapons whichwe have, e.g., superior financial resources, greater share-holdingcontrol of the Roumanian Companies, ability to supply raw materials and capacity to foster neutral oil markets to Roumania&apos;s advantage.Long-Term Contracts.(7) (a) Now that the co-operation of the friendly Companies in Roumaniiihas been more thoroughly organised, the closing of long-term contractshas taken on a new aspect. They still have the importance of settling the position for a prolonged period if the assent of the roumanian government can be secured.  (But see footnote to paragraph 17 above.)(b) The timing and tactics to be adopted in connection with the presentation of these contracts should be left as far as possible to Mr. Berthoud&apos;sdiscretion, subject to guidance from London on matters of finance and principle.Character of Sales to Germany under pressure.(8) Since Germany&apos;s most urgent need is for motor spirit, gas oil andlubricants, the supply of kerosene and fuel oil to Germany wouldprobably be, in comparison, less harmful. If strong pressure is exercised on the Companies by the Roumanian Government to sell toGermany, it should be considered whether the latter products shouldnot be offered in preference to the former. The fact that fuel oil canbe treated by modern processes for the production of other materials should be borne in mind. This matter has been brought to the noticeof the Oil Adviser at Bucharest.
Search for New Oil Fields undesirable..(9) While it would probably be impracticable to reduce the quantities of oilavailable to Germany by artificially restricting production, it is undesirable, at the present juncture, for friendly Companies to embark on an active search for new fields.Stocks at Constanza.(10) While river transport is at a standstill owing to the freezing of the danube, it might be possible to force down prices by reducing our purchases substantially. This course, however, is not recommendedat present since it might enable Germany to secure larger quantitiesin the,spring; and it seems desirable to lift from Roumania any oilthat is available at the port. It has been decided to cease buying crudeand refined products from non-controlled sources, which cover some25 to 30 per cent, of the production of the country.(11) German and Russian agents are reported to be trying to secure addi-tional tankage at Constanza in order to store supplies of Russian oil,probably lubricating oil, pending transport to Germany, either by riveror rail. The friendly Companies are arranging for the leasing offurther tankage in order that as little as possible may remain availablefor Russo-German use. The Mines Department and Ministry ofEconomic Warfare were requested to keep in touch with this aspectand to make all efforts to frustrate the enemy&apos;s plans in this respect.Tne point has been reported to the Oil Adviser at Bucharest.Control Machinery in Roumania.(12) A Committee was previously convened by the British and French Councilrepresenting Allied capital in the Roumanian oil industry. ThisCommittee should continue to act in an advisory capacity in order tofacilitate the preparation of statistics; but, so far as the formulationand execution of plans is concerned. Mr. Berthoud should be left tomake direct contact with M. Wenger and M. Sarret.Sharing Costs ivith the French.(13) The Committee took note that the Mines Department hoped, throughthe Anglo-French Executive Committee, to reach a satisfactory agree-ment with the French for each country to bear her fair share of thefinancial burden.Management of Chartered Boats and Barges.(14) It was agreed that it would be a great convenience if some small british company could be formed to take over the nominal management ofbarges, tanker barges and tugs which had been chartered. TheMinistry of Economic Warfare were requested to explore the matter in consultation with the Ministry of Shipping and take any necessary action, reporting to the Committee for information in due course.(15) The Ministry of Economic Warfare were requested to arrange with theWar Office for Mr. Harris Burland to continue to organise the chartering and purchasing of boats.(16) The Committee took note that, in view of the probability that theRoumanian Government will requisition unemployed barges if thepresent severe shortage exists in the spring, steps should be taken as soon as possible to find harmless employment for the barges charteredby the British and French Governments, and the practicability of moving some of them to Haifa or Alexandria, where they could be usefully employed, is being investigated.Scheme for Iron Gates Canal for later Consideration.(17) In order to increase the congestion through the Iron Gates Canal bylegitimate means after the Danube becomes unfrozen, it is for later consideration whether a scheme could be arranged whereby grainbarges would carry cargoes up river for unloading in Yugoslavia andonward carriage by rail to an Adriatic port. The Ministry ofEconomic Warfare and other interests concerned were asked to explorethis matter with other Government Departments.
Purchase by Germany of Tugs and Barges in Greece and: Turkey.(18) Reports have been received that German agents are acquiring tugsand barges in Greece and Turkey for use on the Danube. The ForeignOffice confirm that two Greek tugs have been chartered by Germany,but no vessels from Turkey. The Foreign Office were requested toask for reports from Greece and Turkey on the matter and to take all possible steps to check this development.Volume of Work thrown on His Majesty&apos;s Legation at Bucharest.(19) Recent reports indicate that the volume of additional work thrown on His Majesty&apos;s Legation at Bucharest justifies an increase in clerical staff and cypherers. The attention of the Foreign Office representativewas invited to this.III. The Statistical Position.24 In our last Report we presented a very approximate comparison between the position of German oil supplies for the first two months of the warand the estimate contained in the Report of Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd&apos;s Committee(W.P. (39) 90), which was the starting-point of our enquiry. To aid us in asimilar comparison we have received from the Ministry of Economic Warfarea report on Germany&apos;s imports of petroleum in the first three months of war.which we attach as an Appendix. From these reports we have prepared thefollowing table : Estimated Supplies of Oil acquired by Germany in First Three Months of War.Report from M.E.W.Intelligence Dept.Geoffrey Lloyd Report (1.351/1 Dec. 25, 1939)(W.P. (39) 90). (Appendix).Tons. Tons.Domestic production ...       ... 600,000 600,000*Russis ...       ...       ...       .. i 125 000 &apos; 9,000277,000-o^io^ri r i&quot;&quot;&apos;w&quot;      \       10,000Estonia        ......       ...Roumania Probable ...       ...       ... 400,000Maximum        ......... 800,000Evasion of Contraband Control Through Italy......... 50,000Belgium and Holland 75,000Scandinavia  ...       ... 75,000_____ 200,000* 200,000Total j ^obable ^25 000 j( Maximum ...       ... 1,725,000 j &apos;* As the estimate is not complete without allowing for oil obtained both from domestic production and Evasion of Contraband Control, figures for these sources of supply have been added in each case by the inclusion of the same figure as in the opposite column.25. It will be seen that Germany supplies of oil are estimated to be downby 200,000 tons as compared with the lower estimate in the Geoffrey LloydReport, and by 600,000 compared with the higher estimate. As we have noreliable information as to the domestic production in Germany during the first three months of the war, we have assumed the 600,000 tons&apos; estimated in theGeoffrey Lloyd Report. Similarly, the Geoffrey Lloyd Report, while drawing attention to the importance of contraband control, did not make an estimate inrespect of evasion; so in the left-hand column we have included the 200,000 tons as stated in the report of the Ministry of Economic Warfare for the first threemonths (Appendix). In other words, the whole of the reduction of 200,000 tonson the Geoffrey Lloyd lower estimate is obtained on imports from Russia, poland and Roumania.26. Although this result is satisfactory so far as it goes as indicating a considerably better position from our point of view than was forecast by theGeoffrey Lloyd Committee, we cannot treat the table as a reliable representationof the position owing to the uncertainty as to domestic production.
27. We ought to mention also that in accordance with the suggestion madeby Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd when introducing the Report to the War Cabinet, theCommittee&apos;s estimates are being revised in the light of actual war experience,and of discussions with the French ..Government. It is understood that theFrench Government believe that owing to the static nature of the war up to date,the estimate of Germany&apos;s war consumption of petroleum products was too high,though we understand that the French view is not accepted in detail. We donot wish, however, to anticipate the revised Report, which will be circulated in due. course to the War Cabinet with any comments.we may have to make.28. Although at the moment we cannot, provide, any very satisfactorystatistical information as to the position, there is some evidence that germany is approaching difficulties. Most of this comes from secret sources, and it willnot.be desirable to give details in this Report. It is sufficient to say that variousauthorities, such as high Staff Officers in Germany, an important and well-knownGerman financial authority and German purchasing agents in two neutral countries, have admitted that there is already a serious shortage of petroleum products, including especially lubricating oils and greases, and that it was goingto be extremely difficult for the Germans to obtain their needs after April. Thereis also&apos;reported a complete absence of certain types of lubricating greases hithertoconsidered essential for certain locomotives of the German railways. An analysismade by a very distinguished scientist, well known to our colleagues, of luricating oil from a German aeroplane shot down in France on the 2nd November showsthat the oil was in a condition considerably worse than is usual for used aircraftoil, even just prior to discarding. The insoluble material in the German samplewas practically three times as large as that in a British Bristol engine after80 hours&apos; use. His analyst was drawn to the conclusion that the German oilhad been in circulation certainly in excess of 100 hours. Since then anotherinstance has been reported, this time from German aviators interned inSwitzerland, indicating serious difficulties in the German supply of luricating oil for aviation.29. One of the reasons which encourages us to think that the policy wehave recommended in the previous section will be successful in putting the enemy in difficulties arises from a statistical review of the Roumanian position: Wethink it might interest the Cabinet to have before them a brief summary of afew of the facts submitted to us by Mr. Briclgeman, Mr. Berthoud and , theGovernment Departments concerned. t. o30. An outstanding fact is that the Roumanian production of oil has beendeclining for some years owing to the failure to discover and develop new oilfields, as shown by the following figures :- Production in 1936 ............       ...      8,703,000Production in 1937 ...Production in 1938 ...Production in 1939 ...Estimate for 1940   ...7,153.0006,610,0006.250,0005,800,000 or say6,000,000Local.consumption, which is expected to increase, may reach 2 million tons. Thisleaves available for export, say, 4 million tons..31. 76 per cent, of the production and 67-8 per cent, of the exports are inthe hands of the six largest Companies, all of which have a large proportion offoreign capital. These Companies are understood to be willing to pease all exports to Germany. If this is effected, the quantity of exports available for purchase by Germany is reported by Sir Reginald Hoare in a despatch, dated the29% December, 1939, to be &quot;well below 1 million tons,&quot; namely, 800,000 to900-000&apos;tons. The upper limit of 1,300,000 fixed by the Roumanian Governmentfor Germany is thus, M. Berthoud reports, unlikely to be reached. Since theoutbreak of war shipments to Germany by the Danube and bv rail have been asfollows : By Danube.    By Rail.        Total.September ......      80,100 800 80.900October    .........      67,700 13,800 81,500November.........      72,700 20,800 93 FOODecember.........      50.600 17.800 68 400271,100 53,200        324,300[20668]
During December difficulties both by river and rail were encountered, such asrailway congestion, and latterly the freezing of the river. In any event the next2 or 3 months, as evidenced by the December returns, should show a serious falling off in Roumanian deliveries to Germany. In these circumstances it seemsextremely unlikely that the average of 120,000 tons a month for the first eight months of 1939, reached at a time when sea transport was open, can be repeatedin 1940.32. Some idea of the difficulties with which Germany must be confrontedcan be obtained if it is remembered that during the first four months of the present war 277 tankers, containing 2,834,500 tons of oil, which sufficed, broadly speaking,to meet the requirements of the Fighting Services and rationed civilian require-ments, were imported into the United Kingdom. The statistical facts mentionedin this section do not give the impression that Germany can have obtained corres-ponding figures to meet her requirements from any internal or external source.33. It may be mentioned here that in the four months September toDecember, the Asiatic Petroleum Company&apos;s purchases of Roumanian oil amountedto 536,000 tons, which figure includes certain purchases for delivery up to theend of March 1940. If it is realised that the British efforts to acquire Roumanianoil have only been operating with full intensity for the last two months of theyear, the significance of the figure will be appreciated. That the effort has been substantial and in a large measure successful, is reflected in the increasingdifficulty which we are having with the Roumanian authorities to secure thenecessary licences for the export of the oil acquired. A. high price has to bepaid for the oil and the fact that prices in Constanza are abnormally high isa measure of Germany&apos;s desire to buy in that market. The competition thatwe are setting up has the effect of making the Germans pay very heavily forsuch oil as they are able to acquire, and this in itself is important not only as weakening still further Germany5s already strained financial resources, butas hampering their powers to buy other raw materials. There seems to us, there-fore, every reason for pursuing the policy with the maximum vigour that ourdiplomatic and financial resources allow.34. In submitting our last Report we were careful to avoid striking anunduly optimistic note, and we say the same to-day. But at any rate we see notthe smallest reason as yet for taking a discouraging view as to the effectiveness of our policy, provided always that the difficulties with the Roumanian Govern-ment can be overcome.IV. Observations.35. We understand that in view of the urgency of the matter instructions have already been sent to His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Bucharest based on theconclusions and recommendations for future oil policy in Roumania, as set forth in paragraph 23 above.36. If the War Cabinet confirm the policy, we suggest that the roumanian government should be warned that if they take action calculated to interferewith the exportation of supplies of oil by producing Companies in which british or French capital exercises a controlling interest, they must expect to meet witlicorresponding difficulties and delays in the supply of commodities to be furnished to them by the British or French Governments. We recommend that the Ministryof Economic Warfare and the Mines Department should keep a vigilant watchon this matter in order to safeguard our interests. This aspect of the questionformed the subject of a conference presided over by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence on the 19th January, 1940 (immediately after thecompletion of this report), the conclusions of which will be submitted to the WarCabinet in a separate report.(Initialled) H.C.January 19, 1940,
(Secret.)1.351/1 dated 25.12.39.Ministry of Economic Warfare,Intelligence Department.GERMANY.Imports of Petroleum in First Three Months of War.1. Channels of Imports.The channel through which Germany has been importing Petroleum maybe classified as : (a) From Roumania.(i) Via the Danube.(ii) By Rail.(&amp;) From the U.S.S.R.(c) From Estonia.(d) By evasion of Contraband Control.(i) Through Italy.(ii) Through Belgium and Holland.(iii) Through Scandinavia.2. Estimates of Supply from Roumania.We are fortunate in receiving regularly from His Majesty&apos;s representative,Bucharest, figures of shipments by river and rail from Roumania to germany which we have every reason to believe are accurate. 11According to these reports, shipments have been : September. October. November.Tons.By river.........       75.000 70,000 72,000By rail    .........       15,000 24,000 21,000Total    ......       90,000 94,000 93.000It is practically certain that there have as yet been no shipments of Russianpetroleum from Baku to Constanza and thence by rail to Germany. In fact,it is known that early in December the use of such a route was mooted, butabandoned owing to lack of capacity in the pipe-lines from the Port to theloading stations and probably also owing to difficulty in obtaining temporarystorage capacity in Roumania.The Germans are reported to be making an effort to increase the carrying capacity of the railways from Roumania. The line to Germany through SouthernPoland is open, but, owing to difficulties in the Russian controlled area, It cannot yet be used. !German Railway Works are concentrating upon the manufacture of addi-tional tank wagons. A number of tanker barges are being constructed and trans-ported in sections from the Rhine to the Danube. Transport facilities may therefore improve.3. Imports from U.S.S.R.The only petroleum known to have been imported by Germany from theU.S.S.R. up to the end of November consisted of fuel oil and was carried in oneor two small tankers from Leningrad to Stettin. These shiploads probably came from stocks of fuel oil at Leningrad and are believed to have totalled not morethan 9,000 tons ** There is just a possibility that these shipments were in fact from Estonia and not fromLeningrad at all.   If so they are reckoned twice in the calculations which follow.[20668]d
It was reported early in December that the Skodawerke had arranged tobarter machine tools against Soviet Petroleum Products to the value of about 135,000, and in view of certain information now in our possession this willprobably be the first consignment of petroleum to be received by Germany fromthe U.S.S.R, since the outbreak of war, other than the 9,000 tons of fuel oil fromLeningrad, described above.The first shipments from Baku, also fuel oil and perhaps part of the barteragreement with Skoda, are being despatched in December by rail from Odessa ata maximum rate of 1,500 tons per day.4. Supplies from Estonia.Official figures for exports of shale oil from Estonia to Germany during september and October have now been received.9,276 tons were exported to Germany in September and 8,406 tons in October.The figures for November have not yet been received, but may be assumed to havebeen 9,000 tons.5. Supplies from Poland.Among the &quot; loot &quot; obtained by Germany from Poland was a certain quantityof petroleum, estimated at about 10,000 tons. Apart from this, however, therehave been no reports of the transfer of petroleum from the Polish fields toGermany. In fact, our information suggests that nothing of importance will bereceived by Germany from this quarter before February next.6. Evasion of Contraband Control through Italy.Information available when our two earlier reports were written, led to thesupposition that about 120,000 tons of petroleum had found their way into germany through Italy in September and October. There is now good reason tobelieve that this estimate was a great deal too high.&apos; In fact, the total leakage into Germany through this channel is thought notto have exceeded 50,000 tons in the first three months of war. This wras made uplargely from the cargoes of one or two tankers, consigned to Germany, which tookrefuge in Trieste in the early days of the war, together with deliveries by theAquila Refinery in completion of pre-war contracts. The present leakage isbelieved to be negligible.7. Supply through Belgium and Holland.Our previous report estimated the total leak into Germany through belgium and Holland in September and October at 34,000 tons. The publication of official Belgian and Dutch Trade Returns and disclosures from Dutch figuresof transit and re-export trade, show that in the first two months of the war,Germany received through Holland no less than 72,000 tons of petroleum products and through Belgium 1,000 tons or more. It is believed that the leak throughBelgium has been negligible in November and may not have been large throughHolland. The total leak into Germany through these channels in the first threemonths of the war is therefore now estimated at 75,000 tons.Some anxiety must still be felt in regard to both Belgium and Holland.Belgium possesses an important lubricating oil blending Industry, and is now very anxious to export 18,000 tons of blended oils, held by her, over and above what is required for domestic use.Although trade between Germany and Holland has been greatly reduced,the Dutch have as yet shown no signs of desiring to come to an agreement withthe Allies on war-time trade and hold very large stocks of petroleum products.Moreover, the opportunities afforded of uncontrolled transit trade with germany by the Rhine are a constant cause of anxiety.8. Evasions of Contraband Control through Scandinavia.Since the previous papers in this series were issued, it has been found possible to undertake a detailed study of the movement of petroleum products to Norway, Sweden and Denmark.The Swedish Authorities have satisfied us that certain shipments ofpetroleum, originally intended for Germany, were, in fact, held up and havenot since left Sweden.
With the possible exception of some quantities of lubricating oil, consign-raents to Norway since the outbreak of &quot;Weir seem to iacIvg been accounted for.On the other hand, the Danish petroleum, situation cannot yet be regardedas satisfactory. Pending further explanations there appear to be between 24,000and 55,000 tons missing. Denmark seems also to possess and to have importedrelatively immense quantities of lubricating products.It is probable, however, that the total leakage through Scandinavia toGermany, part of which may be derived from tankers which have evaded theNorthern Patrols and have gone straight to German Ports, has not exceeded75,000 tons for the first three months of war. This estimate may be reduced if a satisfactory explanation is forthcoming from the Danes.9. Conclusion.It is therefore concluded, that during the first three months of War, Germanimports of petroleum have amounted to about 523,000 tons or less, made up asfollows : Tons.From Roumania       ......     &apos;.........      277,000From U.S.S.R. ............... 9,000From Estonia..................        27,000From Poland..................        10,000By evasion of contraband contrch Tons.(i) Through Italy ......... 50,000(ii) Through Belgium and Holland   ...75,000(iii) Through Scandinavia        ...... 75,000--      200,000Total       ............      523.000The greater part of the leak through the Contraband Control, which represents nearly 40 per cent, of the above total, undoubtedly occurred in the firstmonth of war, and is believed now to have been reduced to something not muchgreater than 10,000 tons per month. It may, indeed, be lower, but its retentionat this rate or its reduction below it seems to depend largely on action taken inregard to Holland and Denmark.The present total rate of import into Germany from all sources appears notto be greater than 120,000 tons a month, of which nearly 80 per cent, is atpresent derived from Roumania. Whether this will increase through additionaldeliveries by rail from the U.S.S.R. or by a faster rate of delivery from roumania remains to be seen.
