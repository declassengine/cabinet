Campbell (Paris).(No. 22.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, January 18, 1940.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government are at present considering the question of allowing volunteers to go to Finland. In view of our own requirements andof the special qualifications rendered necessary by the character of the fightingthere would be little prospect of more than about 1,000 men proceeding to Finlandin present conditions, and His Majesty&apos;s Government are considering whether on the whole it might not be better to discourage volunteering altogether inpresent circumstances, as so small and heterogeneous a force might not do uscredit and could not materially affect the military issue. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are anxious, however, that: this country snould not appear to be laggingbehind France, and I should accordingly be glad if you would ascertain what arrangements are being made in France for enabling volunteers to proceed to finland.10836   [20673]
Sir R. Campbell toViscount- Halifaw.^(Jleceived January 19.)(No. 16.)(Telegraphic.) Paris, January 19, 1940.YOUR telegram No. 22.Ministry of War state that under present conditions it is unlikely there could be any French volunteers for Finland, every Frenchman of military agebeing automatically enlisted in French army. They are in any case opposedto the despatch of small contingents&apos; anywhere. No arrangements are thereforebeing made at present to enable French volunteers to proceed to Finland.Facilities are being given to foreigners in France who are not liable to french military service and to volunteers from other countries passing through.Record of Conversation between the Finnish Minister and Sir Orme Sargenton January 19, 1940.THE Finnish Minister called to-day to enquire what was happening asregards the recruiting of volunteers for Finland in this country. I assuredhim that the matter was being carefully studied and that the apparent delayswere due not to any lack of good will on our part, but because we were anxious that if a volunteer force did go from this country it should, notwithstanding the severe climatic conditions, be of real service to Finland and not turn out to be more trouble than it was worth. I said also that we had in mind the reportthat Brigadier Ling had brought back from his interview with Field-marshal mannerheim, according to which the latter attached less importance to theimmediate despatch of volunteers during the winter than to the organisationof a larger force in the spring, when the strain on, the Finnish army would be far greater than at present, but when, on the other hand, the climatic conditions would be no longer so abnormal from the British point of view. I also told M. Gripenberg of the unsatisfactory attitude that had been adopted by theSwedish and Norwegian Governments in reply to our request that they shouldfacilitate the passage of volunteers across Swedish and Norwegian territory. -he hoped, however, that we would press the two Governments to reconsider thematter.M. Gripenberg explained that even if the number of volunteers from thiscountry did not amount to more than 500, he had hoped that they would serve as a nucleus in Finland around which it might be possible to build! up an inter-national brigade. It would not, for instance, be necessary that the volunteersshould take part in any of the winter fighting, but should be kept in reserveuntil conditions became more normal. In the meantime, its existence would serve as a magnet to attract volunteers from other countries, and he instanced offers thathe was already receiving from Austrians and Frenchmen. He mentioned alsothe possibility of Italians being allowed by their Government to. serve, but i expressed doubt whether the Fascist Government would allow any volunteers to proceed which were not completely organised and controlled by theGovernment.I found an opportunity during the conversation to ask M. Gripenberg whattruth there was in recent rumours which had been going about regarding thepossibility of mediation between the Soviet Government and Finland. To thisM. Gripenberg said that the Secretary of State having called his attention tothe report in Copenhagen telegram No. 13, he had enquired of his government as to what truth there was in the story of German mediation. It would appearthat the suggestion had emanated from a remark made by the Counsellor of theGerman Embassy in Moscow to the Danish Minister in that capital, but thatthe German Government had made no proposal or offer of any kind to theFinnish Government. I said that I had not been thinking so much of mediationby Germany as by one or other of the neutral Powers, who might genuinely be anxious to assist in bringing the war to an end. M. Gripenberg assured me,however, that no neutral Power had discussed the possibility of mediation withthe Finnish Government.O. G. SARGENT.January 19, 1940. ;..-v&apos;i:
