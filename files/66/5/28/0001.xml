THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1940.SECRET Copy No.W.P. (40) 48.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.EQUIPMENT OF THE BRITISH ARMY.Target for the Second Year of War.Report by the Military Co-ordination Committee.AT their Meeting on the 1st December, 1939, the War Cabinet, as the resultof consideration of a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (PaperNo. W.P. (39) 141), instructed * us, in collaboration with the Minister of Supply,to examine in detail the state of equipment and maintenance of the British Armyin France.2. We have examined in great detail the position as regards requirements and supplies likely to be available in the first year of war in respect of the keyitems of equipment referred to in Paper No. W.P. (39) 141; and we have further considered the extent of the military effort which, so far as equipment niay be held to govern the position, is likely to be capable of attainment by the1st September, 1941.3. Assuming as we do that the key items of munitions production referredto are those likely to present the greatest difficulties in supply, we have obtainedfrom the Ministry of Supply estimates of the maximum production which, intheir view, is attainable by the 1st September, 1941. These estimates are givenin Appendix A, and the provisos which govern them in Appendix B.4. For the purpose of these estimates it has been assumed that authority will be given to the Ministry of Supply to provide every factory and all manu-facturing facilities which they can say wall be in production by the1st September, 1941.5. The quantities shown are less than those required for sending even the36 Divisions now in existence overseas by the 1st September, 1941, if it had to beassumed : (a) That wastage starts on the 1st March, 1940, and operates continuouslythereafter;(b) That existing standards of equipment are maintained;(c) That existing estimates of wastage are realised; and(.d) That full provision is made for training.Some of us feel very strongly, however, that maintenance requirements on presentscales of wastage are, in many cases, far in excess of what can reasonably be* W.M. (89) 100th Conclusions, Minute 13.
expected for a force of this size, and we feel that some reduction in the scales of equipment and wastage rates should be considered forthwith. We are advised that this is in fact already being done.6. Even if, therefore, we provisionally accept that the quantities inAppendix A are the most that can be produced in the time, we do not in anyway mean to imply that we should cease to aim at 55 Divisions by. the earliestpossible date. On the contrary, we desire to reaffirm this objective and, in sofar as reductions in scale of equipment and rates of wastage or indeed actualexperience makes possible the operation overseas of more than 36 Divisionsby the 1st September, 1941, then we urge that sanction should not be withheldfor any production plans that may be required to keep other items of equij)-ment in step. We have in mind such items as uniforms, personal equipment and general stores. Sanction may also be required for the provision of additionalexplosives and propellants, on account of the long time required to erect theplants.7. We attach the utmost importance to the authority referred to in para-graph 4 being given forthwith and to the sanctions referred to in paragraph 6being given immediately they are required.8. The Minister of Supply has expressed his concurrence in the terms ofthis Report, so far as they affect his Department..(Initialled) C.On behalf ,of the Committee.Richmond Terrace,February 12, 1940.

The following provisos as regards estimates of production must be made : (i) At this stage, when the effects of war conditions on production are stillunknown in much of the new capacity that is not.yet in operation, it isimpossible to give reliable long-term forecasts of output,(ii) Deliveries on existing plant are liable to interruption owing to delay and damage from air attacks, the probable extent of which cannot before seen; and to the availability of the necessary raw materials andlabour.(iii) Deliveries from new plant are subject to : (a) completion of new factory buildings, which in turn are dependenton availability of building materials;(b) delivery of essential plant and machine tools;(c) availability of labour particularly skilled men.The available output also depends upon deliveries from abroad. Theextent and reliability of these is at present highly problematic.
