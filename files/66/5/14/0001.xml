.SWEMSH ^Og^, S UPPLIBS..,Memorandum from Ministry of Ship-pingand Ministry of Supply (iron and SteelControl)?1. We have been requested to examine the supply position in regard to Imported Iron Ores, with special reference to the possibility- that shipments of swedish iron Ores to this country may be suspended at 31st March?1940.S, (a)    Our present consumption of Swedish Iron Oresper month is;For use in Steelworks ......      80.000 tons.For use in Blast Furnaces ..      90,000     &quot;TOTAL____*.......    say     170,000 tons per month.In addition to Swedish Ores we use about 370,000 tons per month of Iron Ores from other sources.(b) Those grades of Swedish Ores used in theSteelworks are of much greater importance than those foruse in the Blast Furnace.    Swedish Blast Furnace Ores canbe substituted by others without technical disadvantage,but even Swedish Steelworks Ores may also be substituted,with some technical disadvantage.(c) A sufficient supply of Ores to substitute allSwedish ores is available at sources of supply, which are,however,  in seme cases more distant than Narvik, the portfrom which Swedish Ore is shipped.3. STOCKS.(a)    At 13th January,.1940, stocks of Iron Ore inthis country, in terms of weeks&apos; consumption, were asfollows   i-Steelworks Ores       - Swedish 5 weeks.Blast Furnace Ores - Swedish .....    2:f   &quot;OullGX1      0 -F S S       O   O   O   *   o   o    to i n****ao*40*a ^-1-

(b) The stocks are unevenly distributed andunevenly balanced as to qualities.    At 13th January certain important Works had less than 2 weeks stock of SwedishSteelworks Ores*(c) Having regard to the importance of adequatestocks of Steelworks Ores, it is considered essential that over the next 10 weeks stocks of these grades be raised toa figure equivalent to not less than 15 weeks consumption in all.4. SHIPPINGi(a)    Subject to unforeseen shipping circumstances,we may look for the following deliveries of Swedish andother Ores during the period 13th January/30th april-To Arrive. Sweden. Others. Total.13/31st January 85,787 319,538 305,325February 242,350 339,800 582,150March 314,000 356,650 670,650April K 100,000 450,000 550,000TOTAL ........ 742,137 1,365,988     2,108,125Consumption duringthe period will be 505,771 1,404,524     1,910,295Loss or gain in stock -j- 236,366       -     38,536 +     197,830s   These represent arrivals here of ore .shipped from Narvik before the end of March.(b) After April the Ministry of Shipping are makingevery endeavour to provide tonnage to make delivery in Mayand subsequent months of 600,000 tons of Iron Ores from sources other than Sweden.(c) Since the quantities from Sweden between january and April can be taken^ in large measure, insteelworks ores? it will be possible to add to stocks of swedish Steelworks Ores a total of 197,830 tons.    this quantity is equivalent to 10^ weeks consumption of Steel-works Ores.

richmond Terrace, S.W.1. &apos;25th January, 1940.(d) Such a stock should be adequate to safeguard the Steelworks against unforeseen happenings and delaysarising out of a change from near to more distant sources of supply after April.(e) The position in regard to stocks of blast furnace Ores., which is at present unsatisfactory, would remain in the same condition until the end of April, andstock would need to be added to in this class of oreafter April unless meantime more shipping can be sparedfor this trade also.5. Subject to the foregoing programme being carriedout in practice;, a cessation at 31st March of shipment of swedish Ores to this country should cause no insuperabledislocation to the Iron and Steel Industry.6. The Ministry of Shipping are, however, bound topoint out that the increased quantity of ore requiredin consequence of the inferior quality of some of thesubstitutes for Swedish ores and the increased resort to more distant sources of shipment involve an enhanceddemand, which it will be possible to meet only by theallocation of vessels which would have loaded upon someother service.
