(40) 58TO BE KEPT UNDER  LOCK  AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.Copy No.WAR CABINET.MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO FINLAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE, for the information of my colleagues, a memorandum prepared by Mr. Noel Baker, M.P., on Finland&apos;s requirements. Mr. Baker was good enough to give me a copy of this document, but its contents, as well as thefact of its circulation, should be treated as secret.E.Secret ANn Confidential.MEMORANDUM BY Mr. NOEL BAKER, M.P., ON THE ARMAMENTREQUIREMENTS OF FINLAND, AND THE PROSPECTS OF PEACE.I. Finland&apos;s Army and Requirements.FINLAND needs increased quantities of armaments and munitions of almost every kind. These needs should, perhaps, be placed in the following order of urgency : (a) Aircraft.(b) Heavy artillery.(c) Anti-tank guns.(d) Lighter field artillery.(e) Ammunition.2. A aircraft. This must be regarded as the most urgent requirement for thefollowing reasons : (a) The heavy bombing and machine-gunning of the civilian population will inevitably undermine the national morale, if continued unchecked forseveral months. At present it frequently happens that the civilian population of the larger towns spend six or seven hours a day in air raid shelters. Almost all the shelters are cold, uncomfortable andovercrowded, and it is impossible to carry on any form of usefulemployment in them.10886   [20840] b
The raids are also largely reducing the economic output of thecountry.    These results will obviously become more serious as thehours of daylight increase.  The only means of effectively reducing thenumber of raids lies in the increase of the Finnish Air Force of- &apos; fighter aircraft. .(b) The operations of the Finnish army at the Front are severely handicapped by the lack of aircraft.  Here is one example : I General Hegelund has trapped two Russian divisions in theI region round Kitela, on the North-East coast of Lake Ladoga. therefore are, perhaps, 30,000 men who are now surrounded, including twodivisional commanders and three regimental commanders and all their staffs. The whole equipment of both divisions is also trapped. these forces have been cut off from all supplies for over a month. Theirpowerful armament would make it extremely costly to end theirresistance by direct attack; but they would have been reduced byhunger long ago, had they not been able to receive regular supplies by air. General Hegelund has not had one single aeroplane to enable himto prevent Russian bombing machines from dropping supplies to thebeleaguered forces. Every fighter machine is required by the FinnishHigh Command for the protection of armament factories in the centre and west of the country. The whole outcome of his great victory is thus imperilled.(c) Some high authorities believe that the Finnish Army may be defeated inJuly and August by the wholesale forest fires which the Russian AirForce can start by dropping incendiary bombs.    General Hirsch,Chief of Staff of Field-Marshal Manncrheim, believes that this danger,nr, ; can be dealt with, and says that the necessary fire-fighting corps isnow being formed. Other members of the Staff think he is too optimistic. In any case, the only certain way of removing the danger is for the Finns to secure command of the air.3. Heavy artillery. Field-Marshal Mannerheim told us that he urgentlyrequires large supplies of 6-inch and 8-inch guns. He told us that the russians are using their long-range guns for breaking up &apos;&apos; fortresses &apos;&apos; in the front line,and for supporting mass infantry attacks. His Generals have almost no gunsat their command with which they can do counter-battery work. When they are able to reach the Russian batteries, the accuracy of their fire always compels theRussians to move their position within a very short time, i.e., any counter-batterywork that is possible greatly reduces the intensity of the Russian artillery fire.Unfortunately, they have almost no guns with which to do such work.General Hegelund&apos;s action at Kitela provides an example of what this means.Besides maintaining a line round the two beleaguered Russian divisions,General Hegelund must also keep a front against two fresh Russian divisions which are endeavouring to relieve them. This front is subject to continuous and heavy artillery fire. General Flegehmd has not one battery of guns which hassufficient range to do counter-battery work against the Russian artillery.Field-Marshal Mannerheim told us that he needs additional heavy artilleryfor every division, and for every army corps, together&apos; with a reserve to be at hisown disposal. He also needs further supplies for additional Finnish divisions which have not yet been mobilised. -4.   Anti-tank guns.(a) The Finns have invented many methods of disabling and destroying; enemy tanks.   Many of these methods, however, are only applicablewhen the tanks are obliged to attack down a road through the forest.,,.. When the tanks can operate in open country, the only effective weapon- is the anti-tank gun.   Even on the roads, the anti-tank gun is an;  . &quot; indispensable factor in their defence.Yet the Finns have a very inadequate supply of such guns.   they&apos;/,&apos;.....v;; ;    have captured a considerable number from the Russians-and theRussian weapon is simple to use, and highly effective but, even with&apos;    this addition, they have not nearly enough.  On one vital road, wherethere had been recent and dangerous Russian attacks, I saw three
anti-tank guns, and these constituted the complete armament of the division. On another part of the front, a General commanding :anarmy corps told me, as a piece of important news, that he was toreceive one more anti-tank gun, which, he said, would replace one that had been knocked out the day before. -..On the Isthmus, where tank attacks are on the largest scale, andare most dangerous, the Finns have been obliged to use guns which date from the Russo-Turkish War of 1878. These guns only fire oneround per minute, but shoot straight, and have scored direct hits on30-ton tanks.(b) No less important than the guns themselves are adequate supplies ofammunition, of which, at present, the Finns are extremely short.5.   Field artillery, i.e., 3-inch (75-mm.) guns :  1(a) The held guns of the Finnish Army are of 76-2 calibre, i.e., the same asthe Russian guns. This calibre was adopted by the Finnish command in order to enable them to use captured Russian ammunition. Thispolicy has been extremely successful; a considerable part of theFinnish artillery now consists of captured Russian guns firing theirown shells.(b) The total supply of such guns is, however, inadequate, and so are suppliesof ammunition. Moreover, the sources from which the Finns can obtain 76-2 ammunition are restricted. For this reason they are anxious to add to their present armament a considerable number of3-inch (75-mm.) guns.(c) The Prime Minister told us that they would like to obtain, at least a hundred new 3-inch (75-mm.) guns, with the least possible delay;provided they were assured, from British and French sources, anadequate supply of ammunition.(d) If still further supplies of ammunition were also available, the Finnswould transform a proportion of their 76-2 guns into 75-mm. guns.But, of course, the decision to do this can only be taken if adequate supplies of ammunition were ensured.6. Ammunition. Generally speaking, it may safely be said that the Finnsrequire expanded supplies of all categories of gun ammunition which they areusing. This point was raised by every divisional and army corps commander with whom we spoke.II. Finnish Requirements in Man-Power.1. As is well known, the Finns have mobilised sufficient divisions success-fully to hold all their fronts; but they have a very narrow margin of divisions in reserve which can be thrown into any sector that is heavily attacked, or which canbe used to relieve troops who have been in the line for a long period of time.As a result, most of the divisions now mobilised have been continuously in theline since the beginning of the war.2. This does not mean that these divisions have been subject to the kind ofstrain imposed on troops in the line in France during the last Great War. Evenin the sectors where there have been most attacks, e.g., the Isthmus, there havebeen considerable periods of relative repose.(a) During such periods the Finnish soldiers sleep in tents which are notonly dry, but extremely warm and comfortable. Their rations areadmirable. They are not obliged to use communication trenches, butwalk or ski freely among the trees, even in the forward zone.(&amp;) Except during offensives the weight of enemy artillery fire is very much less than that to which troops became accustomed during the last war.(c) Since Christmas a considerable number of troops have been receivinghome leave, which varies from eight days to a fortnight.3. Nevertheless, the fatigue imposed on the Finnish troops is great, and itis desirable that the High Command should have some more divisions at their disposal at the earliest possible date.[20840] b 2
4. Field-Marshal Mannerheim told us that he could mobilise a considerablenumber of new Finnish divisions (he did not say how many) provided : (a) Workers were available to replace men taken from the armament andother war industry factories.(&amp;) He can obtain the artillery and equipment necessary for these divisions.5.   Workers for this purpose are, in fact, being found by the Trade union and Employers&apos; Federations of the other three Scandinavian countries.   As aresult of a conference held in Copenhagen on the 1st February, these organisationsdecided to raise 20,000 men (both skilled and unskilled, but including many. engineers) to go to Finland.  Rates of pay and other conditions were agreed to.One thousand seven hundred and fifty workers registered for this service onthe first day on which the lists were opened, i.e., the 5th February, in Denmarkalone.;..! . 6. But Field-Marshal Mannerheim will not be able to mobilise his Finnishdivisions unless he receives the armament necessary. This makes the provisionof this armament, especially artillery, a matter of great urgency.7. The Prime Minister told us that, in addition to the mobilisation ofadditional Finnish divisions, he hoped that Finland might also receive man-power from abroad.   In particular, he hoped (a) That there would be sufficient Swedish volunteers to make up two fulldivisions.(b) That the Norwegian Government might agree to allow their Sixth (orArctic) Division to come as volunteers to help the Finnish Army inthe North. He said that this Arctic Division consists of highly trained troops who would be of inestimable value during theremaining months of winter.7. The following information with regard to Scandinavian Volunteers was obtained from the Colonel who is organising the Volunteer movement in sweden : (a) Recruits to date are as follows : &apos;.&quot; Swedes     ..................       8,000. Danes      ...       ...      ...      ...       ...       ... 500Norwegians        ...      ...      ...      ...       ... 450(b) Of these, 5,600 have been in action.(c) At the present rate of recruitment, the Swedish contingent will probablyreach 15,000 in the next two months. This is regarded as extremelydisappointing.(d) The low number is due to the fact the Government fixed the rate ofmonthly remuneration too low (150 krone per month, the minimum wage for unskilled labour being 250). But for this, great numberswould have joined in the early stages of the war.This difficulty has now been overcome; the rate of pay is250 krone per month; the costs of the Volunteer Corps are being paid from the Swedish Employers&apos; Fund for Finland, which amounts to 4,000,000; and the Government have privately given it to be understood that further money will be forthcoming from official sources, if required.(e) But, unhappily, the first impetus has been lost, and now recruitment isimpeded by three further factors :- (i) The Government only allows 10-15 per cent, of any given unit of the Swedish Army to go as Volunteers. (This, incidentally,means that the men must be retrained as new units in Finland,and so causes further delay.)(ii) The Government does not allow officers to take any active partin encouraging their men to volunteer. (This is one of thequestions on which Hr. Sandier differs from the Government.)(iii) The Finns do not take untrained men, on the ground that theyhave no spare N.C.O.s to do the instruction.
(./) The Volunteer Authorities are now considering the proposal thatuntrained men should be taken and trained by disabled Swedish-speaking N.C.O.s who have been at the front. Training requiresfive months; but if this plan is adopted, the Colonel in charge believedthat a large additional number of Volunteers could be obtained, andthat they would be ready for service by July.(g) The Colonel also believed that large numbers of Volunteers, and large sums of money, could be obtained from the Scandinavian communities in the United States, provided that the right man to take charge of.the propaganda could be found.The Prime Minister of Sweden, on the other hand, doubted whether this was practical politics, or whether good results could beobtained.  In any case, nothing has so far been done.I        8.   Neither Field-Marshal Mannerheim nor the Prime Minister of Finlandf told us that they wanted British or French land troops to. be sent.This does not mean necessarily that they would be opposed to the dispatch&apos; of British and French divisions. But that it may mean this is suggested by the - ,fact that the Prime Minister told us categorically that he does not desire to havedivisions of Polish troops. His reason for this was that the presence of polish troops might easily provoke Germany into attacking the South of Finland. Thesame argument obviously applies (and, indeed, propably applies a fortiori) to thedispatch of British and French divisions. This view was further supported byHr. Boheman, of the Swedish Foreign Office, who told us, confidentially, thatthe Germans had given them to understand that nothing like a British or Frenchlegion must be allowed to go to Finland.9. Naturally, a change in the military situation, e.g., the impending collapse of Finnish resistance, or even very heavy losses of Finnish man-power, mightremove all doubts and hesitations; but, as things stand at present, it seems doubtful whether the Finnish Government do desire the despatch of British andFrench troops.10. Of course, the dispatch of British and French troops to Finland might involve difficulties not only for Finland, but also, and much more, for sweden and/or Norway. The Swedish Government might be expected to raise objectionsif the proposal is put forward; but it is not certain that these objections couldhot be overcome. Indeed, in the course of our private talks, a member of theSwedish Government used the following words : &quot;If the Western Powers dodesire to send troops to Finland, they should discuss with us, at an early stage,how best this can be done, and how complications with Germany and Russia canbe avoided.&quot;11. In any case, it seems clear that a large increase in the number of Swedishand other Scandinavian Volunteers is a simpler and safer method of providingreinforcements for Field-Marshal Mannerheim than dispatching British andFrench divisions. Such an increase could almost certainly be obtained if theSwedish Government would raise the proportion of Volunteers allowed from any given unit in its army, and would permit its officers to exercise the arts ofpersuasion on their men.; 12. The attitude of the Swedish Government in this regard might be improved if they could be guaranteed large-scale support in case they were attacked by Russia and/or Germany.Fear of such attack is a nightmare to them; and they do not at presentbelieve that Britain and France would, or could, send them any effective aid.Specific promises on the matter might, however, produce an effect.13. The same is true of the Norwegian Government towards the dispatch oftheir Arctic Division. At present the Norwegians are the most cautious of allthe Scandinavians,, but they are also the most likely to be influenced by Britishpromises of help.14. It also deserves to be considered whether an International Brigade of volunteers would not be of great value to Finland.It is probable that such a brigade could be recruited quite quickly, and that itmight attract a considerable number of experienced soldiers.     Its formation
would not give the Soviet Union or Germany the slightest excuse for attackingany given country; while the fact that help was coming to Finland from all overthe world might exercise a real influence on the rulers of Moscow,15. Apart from land troops, the Finnish Army urgently requires&quot; specialists &quot; of various kinds.  Thus :  (a) General Lundquist urged very strongly that he should be given 80 Polishpilots to fly the 80 Caudron fighter aircraft which the French Govern-ment are providing. At present he has been promised twenty. Hewants only pilots who have been trained with Caudrons in France, andwho have been specially chosen by their French instructors for service in Finland.(b) Both General Lundquist and the Prime Minister emphasised their desireto have some British pilots. They left the impression that they would want at least 150 foreign pilots by the summer.(c) They would be glad of heavy artillery-men to work the guns which they hope are coming from abroad. ,(d) They insisted that, in particular, the dispatch of an expert instructor,with every new type of gun, would greatly expedite its use by theFinnish Army.16. General Lundquist would also welcome the dispatch of mechanics with each type of foreign aircraft which he receives.For machines which are assembled in Sweden he would like to see enoughmechanics in that country to ensure the minimum possible delay in the work of assembly.He would like mechanics to assist in the work of repair and maintenance ofall the foreign aircraft actually in service in Finland.III. The Effect of Military Assistance to Finland on theProspects of Peace.4. The Finnish Government believe that they are strong enough, militarily,morally and economically, to put up a prolonged resistance to the Russian attacks.But they also desire to have peace at the earliest possible moment at which itcan be obtained on acceptable terms.2. They are ready, as they were in November, to make concessions to Stalinon the Karelian Isthmus, and in the far North.They will not give him the islands which dominate the port of Vipuuri,&apos; nor any naval base at Hangb or in any other part of Southern Finland.3.   The Prime Minister told us that they have some reason to believe thatStalin now desires to accept these terms and to make peace, and that he is in open and violent conflict on the matter with Molotov and the Russian general  Staff.This also is believed by the Swedish Government, though they are anxiousto keep their information as secret as possible.4. If it be true that there is such a conflict, there are three factors whichwill help Stalin to overcome Molotov&apos;s resistance : *  (a) The heavy losses of the Russian infantry.(6) The no less heavy losses of Russian aircraft,(c) The low morale of the Red Army and Air Force.5. The losses of the Russian infantry have been very great. Field-marshal mannerheim said he thought it might be as high as 50 : LWe saw the ground near Kitela on which a small action had been fought theday before. In this action over 300 Russians were killed, and 160 were taken prisoner; the attack had been made by 80 Finns, who lost four killed and sixwounded.It seems improbable that the Russian dead can number less than 120,000 atthe present time. The Finnish losses, up to the 15th January, were 4,500 killed,11,000 wounded, 900 missing.
6. The Finnish Command only count Russian aircraft the wrecks of whichhave been found on the ground.(a) On this basis, the Finns have brought down 340 Russian aircraft, ofwhich the vast majority are the best types of Russian bombers.(&amp;) This, however, is not the full total of the Russian losses. The Finns saythat approximately 100 others have &quot; probably &quot; been brought down,though the wrecks have not been found. If half of this number arecounted as destroyed, it will probably be less than the truth.(c) A further allowance must be made for crashes on Russian aerodromes.There is much evidence from prisoners to show that, in fact, Russianlosses from this cause have been very heavy. This is no doubt dueto the inadequate training which many Russian pilots have had.(Thirty, forty or fifty hours&apos; flying is quite common among pilots ofthe Russian bombing aircraft.)Under this heading,  it is reasonable  to say that at least150 Russian machines must have been lost.(d) Thus, the total losses of the Russian Air Force probably amount to asmuch as 500 at the present time, and of these almost all are bombers of the latest types.(e) Against this, the Finnish Air Force, up to the 3rd February, had onlylost fifteen machines, of which five had been lost by crashes.    only two fighters had been shot down.(/) Moreover, the Finnish Air Force only numbered 102 machines (includingthirty fighters) when the war began.   It numbered 104 machines onthe 3rd February.(g) If the aircraft promised to the Finns arrive without abnormal delay, theAir Force will probably be doubled in strength in the course of thenext six weeks. The reinforcements will consist of better machinesthan the Finns have hitherto had. If, therefore, the Russians continueto offer the same number of targets as heretofore, it may well be that,by the end of April, they will have lost at least 1,000 machines, and ineach succeeding month the number will proportionately increase.It may well be doubted whether Stalin, with Nazi Germany and militaristJapan as his neighbours, can afford such a great loss of his first-line aircraft as this. It follows that every increase in the strength of the Finnish Air Force, and every reduction in the time within which that reinforcement takes place, will improve the prospects of peace.7. If the facts could be brought home to him, the morale of the Soviet Armyand Air Force would be an even more powerful factor than the losses of men and aircraft in restraining Stalin, and bringing him to offer peace.Evidence of the letters taken from prisoners and Russian dead, the reportsof all Finnish Intelligence officers, who have questioned prisoners, and the resultsof our own conversations with a considerable number of prisoners, all show thatthere is grave discontent in the Russian Army; that discipline is maintained by ruthless terrorism; that the work of the military machine is disrupted by theinterference of political commissars; and that the rank and file of the russian army do not believe that they are engaged in a justifiable war.A memorandum on our own experience with prisoners is attached.(L) Wehave no doubt that it substantially represents the truth. It is for consideration whether steps could be taken to bring the facts of the morale of his armed forces to Stalin&apos;s attention. This may, possibly, be done through the Russian minister in Stockholm, Madame Kolontai. If it could be represented to Stalin that hisgenerals have brought the army to its present dangerous condition, he might,perhaps, embark on another purge, as a preliminary to making peace!IV. British Interest in the Finnish War.1. It may be suggested that, if Stalin can be induced to make peace withFinland on reasonable terms, it would be of the utmost advantage to GreatBritain.(&apos;)Not printed.
2.   There are three reasons for this view :-(a) Such a result would be universally interpreted as a victory for Finland,and would, no doubt, produce a profound effect on German opinion.It would disillusion the German public about the military valueof Ribbentrop&apos;s Russian &quot; alliance.&quot; It would be evidently a victoryfor democracy against dictatorship, and for those democratic Powerswho had helped Finland, i.e., Britain, France and Sweden.(b) It would still further stimulate the resolution of the Governments ofBalkan and other countries to resist any further aggression by Russiaand / or Germany.(c) It would greatly improve the chances that the Scandinavian Powers will ultimately join in resisting further acts of aggression against nations which are now neutral.3. It would be foolish to expect that this last result would necessarily follow.There are two conditions which must be fulfilled before any Scandinavian country would dream of joining in the war against Germany :-(a) The Russian danger must be removed by the re-establishment of peacewith Finland.(b) The Scandinavian Powers must be persuaded that we could really help them, if Germany committed an act of aggression. There is no way in which this could be so effectively done, as by sending arms and munitions, together with pilots, mechanics and other specialists to the aid of Finland.V. Conclusion.The main conclusion which results from the above considerations is that is it/desirable, from the British point of view, to send as much military help asIpossible to Finland, with the least possible delay ? Such assistance must, however,be given in such ways as will 1     (a) Avoid provoking Russia into declaring war on Sweden or ourselves.\    (b) Avoid bringing Germany into Southern Finland in order to keep us out.February 14, 1940.
