(40) 23), as a statement of the instructions and authority which the Service Departments require to enable detailed plans and preparations to be made (a) for the despatch of a force via Narvik to the Northern Swedishore fields;(b) for the occupation of the three ports in Southern Norway;(c) for the despatch of a force to co-operate in the defence of southern sweden;subject to such additions as might prove to be necessary in regard tothe last-named force (see (iii) below);(iii) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to complete as early as possible the Reporton the further instructions and authority (additional to those set outin paragraph 8 of W.P. (40) 23) which the Service Departments wouldrequire to enable detailed plans and preparations to be made for(c) above (see paragraph 10 of W.P. (40) 23).&apos;&apos;2. We are informed that a meeting of the Supreme War Council will beheld on the 5th February, and that one of the subjects for discussion will be thequestion of the Franco-British intervention in Scandinavia. During the last twomonths there have been a large number of reports, memoranda and discussions on. various aspects of this question. In addition, we have recently received through the Allied Military Committee a memorandum giving the views of theIrench High Command on this problem. We have therefore thought it right tofh w0nd the .limited terms of reference set out in (iii) above, and to place beforethe War Cabinet a more complete picture of the Scandinavian project as itappears to us.* W..M.

,      3.   With this object in view, our report is divided into two main sections :  (a) the more important general considerations affecting the problem;(b) a summary of the plans in contemplation, and the decisions required toenable the necessary preparations to be made.(a) General Considerations.Germany&apos;s Grand Strategy.4. In considering the Scandinavia problem, it is first necessary to placeourselves, figuratively speaking, in the minds of the German High Command, andto attempt to get at what they are now thinking and what they are likely todo in the next few months.5. In our view, Germany is likely to decide to take action to ensurecontinuity of supplies of iron ore and oil two commodities vital to the prosecution of a major land and air offensive before launching a heavy attack-on the Western Front. In pursuance of this policy, Germany might well attemptto seize the Galivare iron-ore fields, as soon as the Baltic becomes free of ice,and to risk any temporary interruption of supplies that might ensue. Havingdone this, she may then turn to the south-east for her oil.British Policy.6. We should not, if it can by any means be avoided, leave Germanyundisturbed to prepare the long-term plans which would enable her to build upher resources for an ultimate major offensive against Great Britain and france in the West. It appears to us that intervention in Scandinavia is our first andbest chance of wresting the initiative from her, and, in fact, of shortening thewar. We submit that our policy should be directed towards creating anopportunity for such intervention, and that our military plans should includepreparations to enable us to seize any such opportunity at once.7. Equally, however, we must be prepared to act in the Balkans, in casethe Germans should go that other words, we must make preparation for operations both in Scandinavia and for maintaining a defensive front insupport of our Turkish ally. It is not, of course, suggested that the Allies could operate substantial forces in both areas simultaneously; but neither is itconsidered that Germany could take the offensive in both places at the same time.8. In this Paper we deal only with the question of intervention in scandinavia.A attitude of the French.9. From a memorandum which we have very recently received from Genera1Gamelin, it is apparent that the broad strategical conception of the French high command in regard to the problem of intervention in Scandinavia is substan-tially in accord with our own. The Memorandum shows that the French high command would be prepared to undertake, in conjunction with British force:-and by the side of Norway and Sweden, military action to provide for the defenceof the mineral deposits in Lapland; and it concludes with the following state-ment:  &apos;&apos; It goes without saying that the initial operation should be followedby others, having as their object to strengthen Swedish resistance, as far aspossible on the line of the Gotha canal, and to assure the safety of the mining and industrial areas of central Sweden.&quot;10. The full military implications of an extension of the war to Scandinaviaparticularly the extent to which it would involve a diversion of forces from theWestern front, will clearly require the most searching examination and the most careful planning by the French and British General Staffs. We submit that afull discussion of the proposition by the Supreme War Council is an essential preliminary to the conduct of these Staff conversations.Scandinavian Co-operation Essential.11. The French Memorandum, to which we refer in paragraph 9 above,includes the following passage : &quot; From a military standpoint, therefore, a necessary condition to armedintervention in Scandinavia is the acceptance of, or better, a request for,Allied assistance to Norway and Sweden.&quot;
We entirely agree that Scandinavian co-operation is a fundamental necessity toany major enterprise in that theatre. The plans which we describe later in thisreport are contingent on this co-operation being obtained. How this should bedone is, of course, outside our province.The German Air Threat to Scandinavia.12. There is, however, a point to which it is desired to invite particular attention. The air defences of Norway and Sweden are totally inadequate tomeet the overwhelming scale of air attack which Germany could bring to bear on those countries, and in particular on the cities of Southern Sweden, includingStockholm. It seems likely, therefore, that the Swedish and Norwegian Govern-ments would not be prepared to expose themselves to the danger of such attack,unless we could give them categorical assurances of substantial assistance tomeet it.13. So far as direct assistance is concerned, the air forces which we couldsend to Southern Scandinavia would, owing to lack of operational facilities in southern Sweden and Norway, be limited to two fighter Squadrons, two bomber squadrons and one Army co-operation squadron. This force, even with theaddition of four heavy bomber squadrons based on aerodromes in the UnitedKingdom would be unlikely to satisfy the Swedish and Norwegian Governments..1.4. There remains the question of indirect assistance. As to this, weinvite attention to the possibility of making a public declaration in advance thatif Germany &apos;&apos; took the gloves off &apos;&apos; and initiated bombing in Scandinavia that ledto destruction of civilian life and property as she did in Poland, we should immediately retaliate on Germany.15. It may be that an assurance of this kind would be demanded by the swedes and Norwegians as an indispensable condition of their co-operation.Finland.16. The whole problem of a Scandinavian enterprise is closely linked up with the question of assistance to Finland: and the Memorandum by the french general Staff (see paragraph 9 above) gives the French attitude on this matter.The fate of Finland is certainly a most important factor. If Finland showedsigns of collapse and the Swedes, alarmed at the prospect of a Russian invasion,tailed for the protection of German)&apos;, our last hope of obtaining Swedish co-opera-tion would have disappeared, and with it any possibility of stopping the exportof iron-ore from Sweden to Germany. There is, however, the possibility that the swedes, fearing German &quot; protection &quot; no less than Russian invasion, might turn to us for aid, and we must be prepared to exploit this opportunityimmediately. In this event the defence of the Northern Swedish ore fields against russia as well as Germany would immediately arise; but, owing to the difficultiesof the country, a small force could be expected to hold those fields against muchgreater numbers.17. The question of assistance to Finland is already under close considera-tion and will be the subject of a separate report. In order to keep the issue asclear as possible we do not discuss it further in this paper.Outline Plan for operations in Scandinavia.18. The broad outline of the plan of campaign for operations in scandinavia is as follows : Northern Sweden.(i) A force would be landed at Narvik, with the role of moving up the narvik-Galivare-Lulea railway in order to occupy the Galivare orefields and secure, and if necessary destroy, the port of Lulea in theevent of a major German landing when the ice breaks in the Baltic.Southern Sweden and Nortoay.(ii) As^an inducement we might have to offer to secure the co-operation of the swedes, and in order to assist them against the German attack whichwould in all probability result from our seizure of the Galivare orefields, land and air forces would be sent to central and southern sweden. Their role would be to co-operate with the Swedish forces[20707] B 2
in resisting an invasion from the south, and in opposing any Germanattempt at a &quot;landing on the east coast as the ice receded. Thepossibility of submarine operations against German sea communica-tions in the Baltic is being examined. If practicable, these would clearly form a most important element in the plan of campaign,(iii) As a preliminary to the despatch of this force, bases would have to beobtained at Trondheim and Namsos. It would also be necessary to deny to the Germans Bergen and Stavanger, which has a good aero-drome.Bergen might be required as a subsidiary base for ourselves, andits retention would also have the advantage of securing the Easternend of the Northern mine barrage. We should therefore remain inoccupation of this port.At Stavanger our object would be to secure the aerodrome in case it was required for our own aircraft, and also to prepare it: fordemolition in order to deny its use to the German air forces. once the demolition, if this became necessary, had been carried out. theforce landed there could be withdrawn and absorbed in the main forces operating in south Sweden. Any attempt by the Germans tore-establish the aerodrome could be impeded and probably prevented by air action.The above operations must be considered as part of the mainoperations in Sweden.Forces Required. .19.   The forces required for these operations are as follows :  Naval.Up to 40 destroyers will be required continuously for close escort dutiesduring the time while the main forces are being transported to Scandinavia-a period of about two months. In addition, protection of the convoys willbecome the principal preoccupation of the Home Fleet throughout theoperation. Some 25 trawlers and patrol craft will be needed for the localnaval defence of the base ports.Military.(i) North Sweden. For the seizure of Galivare and Lulea, an initial forceof two brigades would be needed. Any reinforcements required forthis force will be found from the main Allied Army operating in central and Southern Sweden.(ii) Southern Sweden. The maximum force which could be maintainedthrough the bases at Trondheim and Namsos is about five allied divisions. We should be prepared to send a force of this size toco-operate with the Swedes.The first flight would be (a) an  infantry  brigade  of  Regular  troops,  made  mobile withM/T. who would land at Trondheim and Namsos; and(b) detachments of infantry and Royal Engineers to secure Bergenand Stavanger.This first flight would be followed by the remainder of a corps ofthree divisions, a proportion of which should be Regulars, in view ofthe mobile type of operations in which they might be engaged. The,third echelon would be a second corps of two divisions.Air.(i) North Sweden. If an aerodrome is available, one fighter squadron (fromA.D.G.B.) and one Army co-operation flight (to be newly raised).(ii) South Sweden-Two fighter squadrons and two bomber squadrons fromthe Metropolitan Air Force, and one Army co-operation squadron,together with the necessary supplies for an advanced operational base for four heavy bomber squadrons which would operate from the UnitedKingdom.
(iii) The special co-operation of Coastal Command will be required forreconnaissance and escort duties during the transport of the expedition.The total shipping involved amounts to some 20 passenger liners and 380,000D.W. tons of other shipping for the initial movement, which would take about two months. Subsequently some 60,000 D.W. tons of shipping would be permanently taken up for maintenance.The time factor.20. The object of the operation in Scandinavia is to stop the exportof ore from Galivare. It is, therefore, essential to establish a force firmly atGalivare and Lulea before there is any possibility of the Germans reaching this area either by a land advance through southern Sweden or by a sea-borneexpedition to Lulea.21. Records for the last 10 years show that the earliest date by which Luleahas been opened to shipping is the 26th April; and climatic conditions in central and southern Sweden would prevent a German land advance against opposition from reaching Galivare until even later. It is possible that the opening ofLulea might be slightly advanced by the determined action of ice-breakers, andin making our preparations we must therefore work back from mid-April as thegoverning date.* One month must be allowed for the northern force to disembarkand establish itself in the ore fields and at Lulea, i.e.. it must arrive at Narvikby, say, the 20th March. ,,22. We must expect tha,t the Swedes will insist that the forces which areto co-operate with them in south Sweden should arrive simultaneously with thosedestined for Galivare. The timings for the southern Sweden force must,therefore, be the same as for the northern force.23. While all preparations must be made for despatch of the forces so asto arrive at their ports of disembarkation by the 20th March at the latest, theprospect of a late thaw in the Baltic might allow some latitude in fixing the actualdate of sailing.A nthorities required.24. In order that we may be in a position to undertake operations in scandinavia this spring, we require authority from the AVar Cabinet for thefollowing measures : (a) the preparation of the British component of an initial Allied forceof approximately two brigades, specially equipped, together withcertain ancillary units, for the seizure of the Galivare fields. Weunderstand that the French are prepared to provide Chasseurs Alpinsfor one of these brigades.(b) The preparation of the forces for securing the Norwegian ports and operating in Southern Sweden. These would consist of approximatelythree divisions initially, to be later increased to five. They wrouldhave to be provided, in part, by withdrawing one Regular division from France and diverting part of the Illrd Corps. Under originalarrangements the latter was scheduled to start moving to France onthe 2nd February, 1940. A temporary postponement has been orderedbut a very early decision is clearly required.(c) The raising of the necessary base and line of communication unitsrequired for the northern and southern Swedish forces.   This taskmust be undertaken without a moment&apos;s delay if these units are tobe ready in time.   It should, however, be noted &quot;that these units, ifnot used in Scandinavia would be available for operations in anyother theatre which the strategical situation might demand.   No such,        units at present exist, other than those now in France, and the lackj        of them prevents us from taking rapid advantage of the strategicalmobility afforded by our sea power.Ud) The immediate enlistment of Newfoundland log-gers for construction\ work.
(e) The preparation for despatch of one heavy and one light A/A regimentobtained from A.D.G.B. Personnel to replace these regiments is avail-able, but the removal of the equipments will correspondingly retardthe expansion of the gun strength of A.D.G.B.(/) The preparation for despatch of 3 fighter squadrons and 2 bomber squadrons (from the Metropolitan Air Force) and 1 Army co-operationsquadron, and the formation of 1 new Army co-operation flight (toco-operate with the northern Swedish force); also the provision of thenecessary supplies for an advanced operational base for 4 heavy bomber squadrons to operate from the United Kingdom.(g) The provision of anti-submarine booms and torpedo baffles for the baseports (to be drawn from stock and replaced), and the earmarking ofsome 25 trawlers and patrol craft for anti-submarine work.(h) The holding from the 15th February onwards of certain ships of thelarge liner type at present earmarked for the second flight of theAustralian and New Zealand Divisions. Other ships can be madeavailable to take their place, if the sailing of one of the threeAustralian and New Zealand Brigade groups in the second flight isdeferred for about two months. M.T. and store ships will also have tobe taken up, one month&apos;s notice at least being needed to obtain thefull requirements.Conclusions.25. In the foregoing paragraphs we have attempted to present a picture of the military implications of intervention in Scandinavia. Speaking generally,we feel that the enterprise offers us a chance of wresting the initiative fromthe Germans and upsetting their plans, forcing them to improvise (wmich is their weak point) and to disperse their forces, and, indeed, of shortening the war.26. The difficulties and consequences of the enterprise are considerable, and particular attention is invited to the following points :  (a) The co-operation of Norway and Sweden is essential. The price whichwe might have to pay for this might be the opening of unrestrictedair warfare.(h\ The necessary forces can be found only at the expense of the western front and&apos; A..D.G.B.(c) The requirements of shipping and of light craft for escort purposeswill place a severe strain on the resources of the Allies.   In spiteof the adverse effect of this on our trade, the time table must be adhered to.27. We do not, however, consider that undue weight should be given to the inherent difficulties of the enterprise. The stakes are high, but the prize of successis great. We therefore consider that, if an opportunity to occupy the Galivareore fields should be presented, or could be created, we should seize it with bothhands. Unless our preparations are timely and comple e, we will be unable todo so.28. In view of the extensive implications and far-reaching consequences ofthe enterprise, we submit that the Supreme War Council should as soon aspossible discuss it, and the share which each of the Allies is to take.(Signed) DUDLEY POUND.EDMUND IRONSIDE.R.
