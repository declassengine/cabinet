Introductory.AT their meeting held on the 5th February, the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy considered at length Lord Stamp&apos;s Survey of the national resources in relation to our War Effort, which I circulated to the War cabinet for their consideration (Paper W.P. (G.) (40) 35). In view of the great intrinsicimportance of the questions raised, I did not ask the Ministerial Committee to formulate for the consideration of the War Cabinet any final recommendations as to the action to be taken, for it seemed to me that the issues involved were ofsuch great importance that it would be better for the members of the WarCabinet themselves to examine Lord Stamp&apos;s Memorandum in detail and to reachtheir own conclusions in the light of that examination.2. In view of the serious nature of the warning conveyed in Lord Stamp &apos;s paper and of its immediate bearing upon the problem of how we are to financeour war effort, I have myself given the most earnest consideration to.the questions at issue; and I think it might be for the convenience of the War Cabinet if Icirculate the present note, in which I have recorded certain conclusions I havereached.II-The Limitations Imposed by Consideration of Foreign Exchange. &apos;3. After a most exhaustive survey of the available data (particulars ofwhich are given in annex I to his memorandum), Lord Stamp reaches the con-clusion that the net adverse balance on income account in the first year of the war(September 1939-August 1940) is likely to be of the order of  369 millions; andthat, if imports exceed, or exports fall short of, the estimated figure given in thememorandum, the net adverse balance might easily exceed  400 millions. As[20797]Copy No. 24L II. III. IV.-V.-
regards later years, be points out that, while there may be some reductions in imports connected with the development of increased productive capacity for munitions manufacture in Great Britain, it is likely that reductions on this account will be heavily outweighed by increases under other headings. his conclusion is, therefore, that, serious as is the situation disclosed in respect ofthe first year of the war, it is likely that the net adverse balance of payments will increase rapidly and continuously as long as the war lasts.4. There, are certain steps we can take which will serve to bridge part ofthis formidable gap of something like  400 millions between receipts and pay-ments. Thus so far as the Dominions and other Empire countries are willing toallow their favourable balance, including a favourable balance derived from thesale of gold, to accumulate in the form of sterling, it will be possible for us tofind support from this quarter; but the relief to be secured by this and other means cannot, in Lord Stamp&apos;s opinion, be safely put at a higher amount than 100 millions, leaving  300 millions of the adverse balance still uncovered.5. It is also open to us to draw to some extent upon our reserves of gold,foreign balances and foreign investments, but the extent to which recourse can properly be made to these, our last, capital assets, must depend primarily uponthe view taken as to the probable length of the war. Lord Stamp has expressedthe view (paragraph 15) that it would not be safe to look to this source for morethan  150 million in the first year of the war. This question, I need not say, isunder constant and most searching review in the Treasury, and it is interesting,therefore, to record that my Treasury advisers, approaching this problem indepen-dently and from a different angle, have reached a conclusion on this point identical with that arrived at by Lord Stamp and his colleagues.On Lord Stamp&apos;s calculations to finance our adverse balance would actuallyinvolve drawing on our capital assets to the extent of  300 millions a year insteadof  150 millions.6. If we were to incur an expenditure on raw materials mostly in dollarsand other difficult currencies in excess of the vast programme to which wehave already set our hands, we might be able to increase our exports, and thuson balance and at a later stage secure for ourselves a net addition to our foreign exchange receipts, provided that the effort involved did not overtax ouralready heavily burdened shipping resources. It would, however, be most unwise to assume that in the first twelve months of the war we could in this way reduce our adverse balance by more than  50 millions. Even if we were to achieve this result we should still be faced with a net adverse balance of perhaps 250 millions.7. This is a dark and sombre picture, and one which shows all too clearly the limitations which financial considerations alone necessarily impose on our war effort.III. The Limitations Imposed by Consideration of Man-Power.8. When on the 10th January last I circulated to the War Cabinet an inter-departmental report on Supply and Man-Power (Paper W.P. (G.) (40) 9).I drew attention to the vast redistribution of labour in the engineering andother trades involved by our supply problem, and pointed out that, if this wereto be effected at least within the time laid down in the programme we have adopted for the Fighting Services, it would be necessary for us to employ every possible device both to economise labour and to steer it away from activities,which are relatively unessential for war purposes and into the strategic industries.This theme is taken up and developed in the second of the two Memorandaattached to the Report now submitted by Lord Stamp. It is there pointed outthat within the next six or nine months we may be confronted! with a labourproblem so acute that, if steps are not taken in the interim, a violent scalingdown of our war effort may be inevitable. The labour estimates form one aspect of the programmes of the Fighting Services, and, if this part of the plan is out of the bounds of possibility, the plan as a whole may be worse than no planat all, for it helps to create, of itself, dislocation and disproportion in our national war effort. No great harm would result if, as the result of supply being hope-lessly short of the total of the various rival demands, all the demands werescaled down in proportion; but, as the Memorandum points out, it is morelikelythat in such circumstances the plan might degenerate into a system of &quot; firstcome first served,&quot; which would produce results exactly the opposite to those
required. For example, if an acute shortage of engineering and related labourwere to develop, the results would be disastrous to the very important exporttrade in engineering products unless certain numbers of workers were definitelyearmarked for employment on the manufacture of exports. The conclusion drawn,in the Memorandum, which is endorsed by Lord Stamp, is that if it is decidedthat a shortage of labour must not occur, then positive policies must be followedwhich will prevent the imminent shortage. If, on the other hand, it is decidedthat a substantial shortage is inevitable, then the whole requirements of theFighting Services must be re-considered in order to prevent the shortage creatingchaos. Merely to leave events to move of their own momentum is tantamount to deciding that no general control at all is to be exercised over the relativestrength of the Fighting Services and the relative claims of other demands uponindustry.9. Thus the position as regards man-power points to the same conclusion asthat suggested by the examination of our financial resources, namely, that we are confronted with an element which may well prove to be a limiting factor to ourAvar effort.10. In the meantime the Minister of Labour and National Service, inaddition to developing his Departmental machinery, has taken special steps toenlighten the employers and unions in the engineering industry (which is theindustry most greatly affected) as to the demands which the programme will make on that industiw, and to secure their advice and co-operation in any steps necessary to meet those demands. Both employers and unions are wholeheartedlywilling to do all they can to help. They were in both cases impressed by the magnitude of the labour requirements forecast, but until they have had a little time in which to study them in detail, it is not possible to say whether they willregard their requirements as practicable within the time limits specified.IV. Other Limitations.11. Lord Stamp&apos;s Memorandum does not deal except incidentally with two other factors both of great importance and each capable, unless adequatelydealt with, of rendering it difficult, if not impossible, to complete the existing service programmes within the time prescribed.12. The first of these factors is that presented by the machine-tool problem.The War Cabinet will recall from previous discussions the prodigious efforts which we are making to meet the needs of the Fighting Services in this matter,through enormous purchases in the United States, at great sacrifice to our dollar resources. On the top of this is the proposal that we and the French shouldorder large numbers of aircraft from the U.S.A. from firms who would have tomake largely increased demands upon the machine-tool industry. We cannotescape the conclusion that the difficulty of securing machine tools for our own new factories by the dates required is so great that it may be found that for this causealone the supply programme is incapable of achievement in the time allotted.13. The second adverse factor which we must take into account is the complex of difficulties presented by the supply of raw materials. In most cases there is no world shortage of the raw materials that we need for our war programme; and the imminent prospect of acute shortage which confronts us inthe case of some raw materials is not due to this cause. Nor is it due wholly orin greater part to the further strain which additional purchases would throw onour financial resources; great as are our difficulties under this head. The mainfactor which limits our capacity to import raw materials to the full extent thatwe desire is simply that we do not possess, and, try how we may, wre cannotobtain, the amount of shipping required to carry this vast increase of imports toour shores. Thus, in the field of raw materials also, we are confronted with anintractable problem which has a direct and inescapable bearing on the timing,if not the size, of the Service programmes.V. Conclusions.14. There are thus four factors each of which in varying degrees conditioneither the extent of our war effort or the period required to bring it into full operation, namely :  (i) foreign exchange,(ii) man-power.(iii) machine tools.(iv) raw materials.
15. Lord Stamp, dealing with the first two of these factors reached theconclusion (paragraph 21) that there are two courses of action open to us : (i) to allow the present objectives to stand with the knowledge that theycannot be attained, but with the intention that the utmost progresspossible shall be made along each line, as contributory to the totalplan;(ii) to scale down the programme to lower figures or to spread them Overa more extended period. This would make it possible to secure aharmonious balance between different parts of the programmes, suchas would have been established if they had been the programmesoriginally drawn.16. For the reasons which I have already indicated. Lord Stamp discardedas unprofitable the first of these. alternatives; and, if we accept his view, weare thus left with the choice between : (a) scaling down our programmes to lower figures; and(6) spreading the carrying out of the programmes over a longer period.17. Having regard not only to these two factors dealt with by Lord Stampin his Memorandum but also to the difficulties presented by the supply of machine tools and certain raw materials, alternative (b) is much to be preferred.18. As regards the Army Programme (I am not dealing in this paperwith the Navy or Air Force Programmes) our present difficulties are, I believe,greater than they need be by reason of the fact that no definite direction hasbeen given to the Minister of Supply on the question whether he is to strainevery effort to provide by the end of the first two years of the war the equip-ment required for 55 Divisions, or whether (while making all necessary plans to this end) he is to address himself primarily at the present stage to achieving a more limited objective in the first two years of the war.19. As the result of my examination of the problems, at once extremelyintricate and extremely important, with which we are confronted, I think themost practical course is for the Minister of Supply to frame his plans in two stages : (i) doing as much as he can in the next eighteen months, and(ii) in the meantime planning for the remainder of the 55 Divisions as soonas he finds it practicable to do so.20. As regards the building programme, the date on which any givenfactory is begun must necessarily determine the date on which full productioncan be achieved; but the length of time required to build and equip factories ofdifferent kinds varies very greatly.   I suggest therefore that the list of factories required for the full programme of 55 divisions should be examined from this angle, and that while orders should atonce be given for constructing factories of complicated types requiringeighteen months or more for their completion, the erection of factories ofsimpler type, such as those required for shell production, should not beput in hand until it can be seen whether and when they will be required.21. The question whether it is necessary that every Division should be equipped on the full British Army scale, or whether better use could be made of available material by adopting a lower standard of equipment for some Divisions(thus increasing the total number of Divisions available for service within the24 months), is, I understand, engaging the attention of the Secretary of Statefor War, who, I have no doubt, realises the importance of this matter.I would suggest that, in view of the difficulties disclosed by the presentposition, the Secretary of State for War should also consider whether any economies (by way of simplification of specifications or otherwise) can be achieved in the present scale of equipment for the Army.J.
