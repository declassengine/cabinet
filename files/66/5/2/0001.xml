naval SITUATION.General Review.THE period has again been one of relative quiet at sea, there being only-minor incidents to report apart from the loss of H.M. Submarines, Seahorse,Starfish and Undine. In home waters operations against German merchantvessels have been carried out off the Norwegian and Dutch coasts, in the latter case with some success.Enemy attacks on seaborne trade by air, mine and submarine have continued,and have perhaps been slightly more effective than during last week.The crisis in connection with the military situation in Belgium and Hollandnecessitated an increased degree of readiness being maintained by our light forces on the East Coast while it lasted&apos;.The movement of Australian and New Zealand troops continues. the interception of the Russian S.S. Selenga in the China Seas is of interest asbeing the first case of this kind in that area, although our patrols there havebeen continuously active since the outbreak of war.Home Waters.2. Following the attempt of the S.S. Bahia Blanea to return to Germanythrough the Denmark Strait, patrols in this area have been strengthened. Strongforces are at sea in the northern area covering the convoys to and from Norway.A search for the German S.S. Trautenfels, which was reported disabled offthe Norwegian coast, was abandoned on account of bad weather; a full galewas blowing at the time. .    ,H.M. Submarine Trident, which returned from patrol off Murmansk lastweek, reports sighting several merchant vessels and one warship. The cold wasnot so severe as was expected.3. Acting on information received from H.M. Submarine Salmon, that coast-wise traffic between Germany and Holland was moving outside Dutch territorial waters, sweeps by our light forces have been carried put to intercept it. On thefirst occasion the German S.S. Phaedra (619 tons), cargo flour and wood pulp,and the Dutch S.S. Rijtroom (695 tons) and Vechtstroom (845 tons) were sentinto the Downs. On the second occasion the Latvian S.S. Rasma was intercepted.Light forces have also carried out minelaying operations in the Heligoland Bight.4. Enemy air attack on East Coast shipping was renewed on the afternoon of the 12th January, but was confined to traffic off the Yorkshire and Norfolkcoasts. Details of the ships attacked on this day and on the 11th January(which latter were not available for last week&apos;s resume) are shown inAppendix 2.The number of vessels attacked on the 12th was fewer, and no ships were sunk. Lightships were attacked on both days. Some of the aircraft madecontact with convoys but attacks were not pressed home.5. H.M. Submarines Seahorse, Starfish and Undine sailed for patrol on the26th December, 5th January and 31st December, respectively. The two latterhave been openly claimed by the enemy, and as the Seahorse is considerablyoverdue she has also had to be regarded as lost.There is an unconfirmed German report that 4 officers and 26 men have beenrescued from the Starfish and Undine.6. The fogs and snowstorms have caused a number of casualties to vesselsby collision.   Five destroyers have been so damaged, in one instance seriously.Protection of Sea-borne Trade.7.   509 ships, including 20 Allied and 57 neutral, have been convoyed during   1the week.   This is the highest total in any one week since the war started.   Two   Iof these, the S.S. grant a and the S.S. El Oso were lost, probably by mine, theformer off Cromer and the latter in Liverpool Bay. -
44 destroyers, 12 escort vessels, 4 submarines and 2 cruisers have beenemployed in escort duties, in addition to two battleships and seven armed merchant cruisers for ocean escorts.Anti-Submarine Operations.8. Anti-submarine activity has been most pronounced in the Irish Sea, inthe Liverpool approaches, and&apos; in the Bristol Channel where submarines aresuspected of mine-laying. Although many searches were made, no promisingcontacts were established and the four attacks carried out were probably on non-sxibmarine targets. Two attacks were made off the East Coast by surfacevessels and one by aircraft, but with no visible result.German Attack on Sea-borne Trade.9. There has been a slight increase in the sinkings during the past seven days, the losses from all causes being 8 ships, totalling nearly 39,000 tons; outof which 3 ships, of just under 20,000 tons bp all, were British. The majorityof these losses were due to mines; but two neutral ships, the DutchS.S. Arendskerk (7,906 tons) and the Norwegian S.S. F. fheim (1,590 tons),were torpedoed by a submarine in the Western / .oaches, the formerdeliberately after a search, and the latter without wa- tang. Neither were in convoy. Two of the ships lost were out of the channel&apos;;? they had been directed to keep to; this emphasises the importance of accurate navigation. The nameof the unknown Norwegian ship reported as sunk on the 9th January, in lastweek&apos;s Resume, was the S.S. Manse (1,343 tons).10. Details of sinkings for the period are given in Appendix I to this resume, and a chart of the weekly sinkings is attached. This chart sets outthe sinkings for each week of the war. The periods shown are from Sundaymidnight to Sunday midnight and therefore do not correspond exactly withthe period covered by this report, which, as regards merchant vessels&apos; losses,covers the period Wednesday noon to Wednesday noon.A diagrammatic analysis of German submarine activities up to the end of1939 is attached to this Resume. A study of this shows that German submarineactivity has been steadily decreasing and suggests that the North Sea is becomingthe principal operational area for submarines, whereas for the first few monthsthey were most active on our Western seaboard.The diagram also brings out how the submarines have avoided the IrishSea and English Channel, possibly due to fear of increased patrol activity innarrow waters.German Minelsying.11. A mine field is suspected off Liverpool and there may also be mines inthe Bristol Channel, but fog has delayed sweeping operations. Mines have beenswept up in the searched channel off Blyth, and here, again, owing to fog it hasnot been possible, to clear the channel properly, so that traffic north of the Tynehas had to be held up, which has caused considerable congestion. Sixty-one mines have been accounted for in the Tyne area during the period. Two magnetic mines&apos; have been exploded by aircraft off Folkestone.Experiments are being carried out in demagnetisation of various classes ofships in order to minimise the danger from magnetic mines. The results up todate are promising.British Contraband Control.12. Cargo seized in prize during the week ending the 13th January totals3,364 tons. This includes 445 tons of ores and metals. 316 tons of oil seeds.562 tons of foodstuffs and beverages and 478 tons of rubber.13. The Russian S.S. Selenga (2,492 tons), bound from Manilla toVladivostok and believed to be carrying contraband, was intercepted in theFormosa Strait and sent into Hong Kong for examination.r20649] B 2
German Merchant Shipping and Intelligence.14. The Tsingtan, a vessel of about 2,000 tons employed as a depot ship forMotor Torpedo Boats, is reported to have been mined, and docked at Hamburg.The S.S. Bahia Blanca (8,558 tons), reported in last week&apos;s Resume&quot; to besinking, had a cargo of manganese ore and coffee. Sixty of her crew were recscued by an Icelandic trawler.The German S.S. Albert Janus (1,598 tons), which left Vigo on the14th January with a cargo of ore, was intercepted the same day by the FrenchArmed Merchant Cruiser Victor Schoelcher and scuttled herself. The crew were saved.The S.S. Trautenfels (6,418 tons) lost her rudder off the Norwegian coastoutside territorial waters, and, although efforts were made to intercept her, shereached safety.Nearly 100,000 tons of German shipping-Jeft Narvik for Germany viaterritorial waters between the 5th and 15th January; about 28,000 tons are still at Narvik.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.15. The order placing the B.E.F. on six hours&apos; notice to meet any eventualitythat might have arisen out of the crisis of the last few days has now been cancelled.On the Saar front, the 8th Infantry Brigade relieved the 4th infantry brigade during the night the 14th-15th January without incident.The 48th Division is now assembling in France.Apart from the usual enemy artillery activity, and minor clashes betweenGerman and French patrols, no events of importance have occurred in the Franco-German zone of operations.16. The main centre of interest has been the German frontier oppositeHolland and Belgium.Information was given last week regarding the situation on these frontiersas far as it was known on the 11th January. Subsequent information receivedincludes the following reports : *A new army under General Kiichler forming at Dortmund and Dusseldorf,munition dumps at Waldeneath and Geilenkirchen (North of Aachen), further&apos;road construction and improvement, and that the German residents of theLimburg province of Holland and Belgium were being recalled.Air reconnaissance noted some troop movement towards the Dutch frontier,while identifications showed a small increase in German formations (includingS.S. and Armoured Units) in the Munchen-Gladbach-Aachen area.Germany.Baltic Coast.17. The number of reports of activity on the German-Baltic Coast hasdecreased. At the same time it is believed that the situation has not changed inany way, and that there are a number of naval, military and air units in theGerman coastal area available, if required, for operations. The germans have considerable experience in embarking and disembarking troops, and for someyears past attention has been paid to this form of training. Large-scalecombined manoeuvres were carried out in 1937, when a number of formations weretransported by sea. In 1938 further exercises were held at Kiel, when theassembly and convoy of military transports was practised.The conclusion from these and other reports is that the German GeneralStaff, and certain formations, have already considerable peace-time experience in working with the German JNavy and Mercantile Marine in the preparation and execution of combined operations.
Eastern Frontier.18. An observer, who has just returned from Poland, states that the Germanfortifications on the new German-Russian frontier are only of a minor nature.They consist of shallow trenches with occasional field-gun pits.On the Russian side of the frontier, however, the fortifications are ofconsiderably greater strength. They consist of deep, well-built trenches linkingup with gun emplacements sited in natural cover.Internal Communications.19. Reports received early in September showed that the Germans were using railways in preference to roads for the movement of troops. Towards theend of September, however, the movement of troops from Dusseldorf towards thefront took place by road owing to the temporary congestion of the railways. Afterthe Polish campaign German troops in large numbers were moved by sea from east Prussia and Poland to Stettin, Lubeck and through the Kiel Canal toHamburg.During October and November troop movements were made by rail, even overshort distances and in cases where the main roads would have seemed the more convenient method, whilst civilian rail traffic was frequently cancelled to allowfree movement for military purposes.The restrictions on road transport, estimated to have reduced traffic by atleast 80 per cent., must have thrown a heavy extra burden on the railways, andthe recent serious accidents may be due rather to the over-fatigue of the personnelthan to defects in rail or rolling-stock. There is no proof that recent collisionshave been due to deliberate interference.Owing to the transfer of railway staffs to Poland, women are being recruitedfor railway service.20. Various reports show a considerable shortage of railway trucks inGermany, and this shortage is intensified by the need for sending many trucksto Poland, as the Russians took possession of the majority of the captured Polishtrucks. It is reported that the Russians are claiming the return from germany of the rolling-stock previously allotted to the Lemburg Division of the Polishj State Railways.Germany&apos;s waterways have been of considerable use for facilitatingindustrial traffic, thus reducing the strain on both railways and roads. Reportsshow that this method of transport is to be used to the maximum. It should be particularly useful for bulk military stores and ammunition.tltaly.21. Although the basic organisation of the Italian Army in &quot; binaria &quot;(two-regiment) infantry divisions can be considered as nearing completion, it isofficially stated that various important matters of organisation have not yet been determined. Amongst these are the method of incorporation of Blackshirts inthe infantry division, the organisation of the mobile (cavalry) division, the composition c4 the motorised division, and the organisation of a third armoured division. ShYuld it prove impossible to reorganise and train these specialisedformations adequately by the spring of 1940, they could be employed with their&quot;existing organisation.   There is no apparent haste in reaching a decision, andthe Italians may await the results of fighting on the western front before^committing themselves to a final organisation.Reservists of the 1911 class (called up in part only) and men with large families of the 1916 and older classes have been discharged. Metropolitan troopscontinue to obtain leave from Libya and probably Albania, as well as in Italy.Leave is granted without pay, an economy in. military expenditure, whichinterferes little with training,, as the numbers probably do not exceed 20 per cent,at any time. ... i.Senior officers of the black shirt Militia are receiving military instruction atcourses arranged by the General Staff, presumably in order to raise the standardof militia units to that of the Italian army and to facilitate the eventualincorporation of militia units in the army.
It has been denied at the Italian War Ministry that military volunteers have left for Finland, or that it is probable that any would be sent, as was done in theSpanish Civil War.Estonia.22. Further contact with Russian troops has not improved the low opinionof the Red Army formed by most Estonians during the early days of theoccupation. The general appearance of the men has dealt a fatal blow to thesmall Communist element in the country.It seems that the Russian soldiers are very well behaved, and that officersand men studiously avoid contact with the Estonian population.In other ways the discipline of the Red Army does not appear to be sosatisfactory. Relations between officers and men seem fairly cordial, but the menshow no deference to their officers, and frequently argue before carrying out an order.Both officers and men are said to be lethargic and lacking in intelligence.All reports agree on the surprise displayed by the Russians at the conditionsof living in Estonia, and on the pitiful disdain with which the Estonians regard the Red troops.AIR SITUATION.Royal Air Force Operations.Bomber Command.Operation against the German Fleet.23. Patrol and reconnaissance flying has been severely restricted by adverse weather conditions over the North Sea area, but sweeps have been continued in sofar as weather permitted, including a sweep in the central area of the North Seaby eighteen Hampden aircraft on the 12th.Rail Reconnaissance over Northern Germany.24. Two aircraft reconnoitred the Osnabruck-Hamm areas on the night ofthe llth-12th January, with the object of ascertaining how far German railactivity could be seen and assessed at night under black-out conditions. Theypaid particular attention to marshalling yards, which are key points in theGerman railway organisation. The reconnaissance was successful, and it is interesting to note that the pilots report that under the favourable weather conditions prevailing at the time, it was&apos; possible to pick out details of theactivities in the yards, even from a considerable height. These marshalling yardswTould appear to provide good bombing targets for night operation under favour-able conditions. The reconnaissance aircraft also dropped leaflets on Diisseldorfand Frankfurt.Extended Night Reconnaissance.25. Three Whitley aircraft reconnoitred North-West Germany, austria and Eastern Germany on the night of the 12th January. The reconnaissance was successful, and all the aircraft returned safely without encountering any opposi-tion from enemy fighters, although weather conditions were good. opposition from the ground was reported to be negligible. Two of the Whitley crews werein the air for ten and a half hours on this reconnaissance.The pilots reported that the black-out in South Germany and Austria wasindifferent, and made special mention of the poor effort to black-out Vienna.
Anti-Minelaying Offensive Patrols over German Seaplane Bases.26. Patrols over Borkum and Sylt were maintained on four nights of the-last week. Weather conditions on the remaining three nights were such as to preclude minelaying operations by German seaplanes, and in accordance with the accepted policy,&apos; our patrols were not despatched on those nights. Patrol pilotshad little to report of enemy activity, although on one occasion an enemy flarepath was observed and bombed.   The lights were promptly extinguished.Advanced Air Striking Force.27. Fighter patrols have been maintained over the Western Front wheneverflying was practicable, but no engagements resulted.A Blenheim reconnaissance aircraft of the Advanced Air Striking Forcelocated a concentration of troops south of Trier. This aircraft was attacked by four Messerschmidt fighters, and although the aircraft sustained severe damage,the crew succeeded in beating off their attackers and reached a French aerodromewith their photographs and information.R.A.F. Component, British Expeditionary Force.28. Improved weather conditions in France during the earlier part of theweek permitted an increase in air activity. The normal fighter patrols, training and photographic flights over the British Expeditionary Force area have been maintained without encountering the enemy. Extensive visual and photographicreconnaissances of North-West Germany were carried out by Blenheim aircraft on three occasions, and useful information was obtained. Pilots have reporteddense white smoke, generally covering the area between the Rhine and the german frontier, extending as far south as Cologne and Aachen, and persisting betweenthe 10th and the Isth January. One pilot stated that there appeared to be fivedistinct sources of this smoke. Weather conditions -Vvere such that it is possiblethat this was industrial smoke hanging over the area, but it is interesting to note that Intelligence reports have mentioned smoke-laying exercises in the Aachen^strict.  The origin of this smoke is being investigated further.Coastal Command.29. In spite of the bad weather prevailing generally over the North Sea,&quot;Coastal Command completed 39 routine and 73 special patrols, in additionto providing air escort for 37 convoys. Six mines were located and reported and four submarines were sighted. A Hudson aircraft attacked a submarine on the15th with two 250-lb. bombs in a position 116 miles to the eastward of Buchan Ness&quot;without any visible result and on the following afternoon two aircraft made fourseparate attacks on a suspected submarine in Liverpool Bay.On the 13th a search was made by an aircraft and a high-speed launch forthe crew of a Heinkel shot down by our fighters.  The launch rescued one member-of the crew, who was found swimming in an exhausted condition some miles out to sea.Fighter Command.30. The recent German air threat against shipping has increased they commitments of the Fighter Command and new standing patrols have had to be instituted as an immediate measure. The Command despatched 275 patrolsinvolving 812 aircraft, during the week. A Heinkel III K was intercepted off the/irtn of Forth and shot down. On the 12th a Dornier 17 was sighted by fighters and engaged by anti-aircraft guns over the Thames Estuary, but it was lost intrie clouds.German Air Activity.On rhl&apos; iot^r^aVlir attacks 011 shipping have decreased during the past week./&apos;     ?. iZtti tbe jiast Coast convoy was attacked without result and there were&apos;sporadic attacks on individual ships on the 11th and 12th as reoorted inot lio-ht i m the 12th onwards there are no reports of attacks on shipping&apos; ro*r?t Y ASr &apos; out the prevalent bad weather may have been responsible for thisow^T j M teorological and reconnaissance flights over the North Sea were continued when weather permitted.
There is no relaxation in the intensity of advanced flying training, andjeports from East Prussia and Pomerania, indicating activity both by day andby night, have been persistent.Violations of Belgian neutrality by German aircraft have shown an appreciable increase in the past week. As a security measure, the Belgians are understood to have blacked out the Liege locality, reinforced the defensivepositions on the Albert Canal, and to have made a, partial evacuation of districts in Eastern Belgium.32. Technical examination of German aircraft which have fallen into our hands does not show any advance or improvement in aero-engine design beyond what was known before the war, with the exception of direct fuel injection. the self-sealing properties of the German petrol tanks so far examined are of a highorder. Their cameras and their collapsible rubber dinghies are both appreciablyheavier than our counterparts, without being any more efficient.Foreign Air Intelligence.China.33. The Japanese bombing of the Hanoi-Kunming Railway appears to havehad a more far-reaching effect than was reported in the Press. This line wasthe normal import route for Chinese supplies of liquid, fuel, and China issuffering an acute shortage of fuel, particularly aviation petrol. Although theU.S.S.R. is supplying certain war materials to China, it is most improbable thatshe will be able to assist with supplies of liquid fuel. The cutting of this railwayis, therefore, a shrewd blow to China. Alternative routes cannot be developedquickly, and a measure of the importance of maintaining imports may beobtained from the fact that the Chinese are exploring the possibility of importingpetrol by air and are trying to purchase ten aircraft for this purpose.34. Chinese reports of the fighting in Inner Mongolia between the 19th and22nd December indicate that the initial Chinese success was reversed by the arrival of 100 Japanese aircraft, whose bombing was mainly responsible for theChinese casualties and retirement.RUSSO-FINNISH HOSTILITIES.Situation at Sea.35. There have been no naval operations since last week, but during theweek the Finnish presidential yacht, the A ura, was torpedoed by a Russiansubmarine while on convoy duty. She was a small vessel of some 500 tons displace-ment. There are reports that other small auxiliaries have also been sunk in theGulf of Bothnia.  No details are given.On Friday, the 12th January, another heavy bombardment of Koivisto tookplace, which was finally repulsed. This island battery guards the right flank of the Mannerheim Line, and the Soviet anxiety to reduce it is obvious. It isprobable that this bombardment was carried out by the Marat. The OctoberRevolution was reported to have been hit last week.More details are now to hand from the Naval Attache with regard to naval operations from the beginning of hostilities. This information has been supplied by the General commanding the Sea Defence Forces, and is as follows : No action between ships has taken place, but Russian naval forces, especiallydestroyers, have been active against Finnish coast defence forts.At Koivisto some 400 tons of enemy shells have been directed at the battery,but no damage to any of the guns or emplacements has been sustained. Anattack by enemy battleships was answered by the fort (4 10-inch) at a range of between 20,000 and 25,000 metres. About fifteen rounds were fired by the Finnsat a rate of about one round per minute, and one hit was observed on OctoberRevolution.At Hango, Ryssaro battery (4 10-inch) engaged Kirov and one destroyer ata range of about 20,000 metres. About forty rounds were fired, resulting in onehit on Kirov and one hit on the destroyer, which is thought to have sunk her.
&apos;-&apos; --&quot;-At "to , two Russian destroyers were engaged in low visibility at about10,000 metres. One was hit, whereupon the other covered her with a smokescreen, and was herself then engaged. Both then retired, and shortly afterwardsa heavy explosion was seen and heard, and subsequently only one destroyer was seen on the horizon, disappearing.At Lappvik the Finnish armoured ships Vainamoinen and Ilmarinen were attacked by some fifteen aircraft. Four separate attacks were made, at a height of 15,000 feet, and on each attack one aircraft was shot down by the 4-inchA.A. guns of the ships. Four casualties were sustained yy the ships by splintersfrom a near miss.Ice conditions are-unchanged. Navigation is suspended in the northern part of the Gulf of Bothnia, but Vaasa and Turku are kept open by icebreakers.At Hango and Helsinki navigation is possible for high-powered vessels. Viborg,Kronstadt and Leningrad are closed.   At Tallinn navigation is unrestricted.Situation on Land and in the Air.i- 36. Reports tell of the dislocation in Russia of both civil and militaryactivities due to the Finnish war. Conditions in Leningrad are deterioratingand hospital arrangements appear to be inadequate, congestion on the railwaysis frequent, and difficulties appear to extend as far as the railways east of the caspian Sea. Further drafts have been drawn from the garrisons in the west,and the departure of troops from the Urals and the far east for the Finnishfront is reported.Many Soviet leaders fear hostilities with the Allies; this is illustrated by the strengthening of the garrison and defences of Murmansk and by intensive workon the fortifications on the Black Sea Coast.37. There have been no important military developments on the Finnishfronts during the week, probably because the Russians are awaiting the arrival of reinforcements and because of the intense cold. The Finns, meanwhile, have endeavoured to encircle the two Soviet divisions operating along the north shore of Lake Ladoga and also the Soviet forces west and north-west of Salla, thoughthe situation in the latter area is obscure.There are signs that Soviet reinforcements are beginning to arrive, at any rate, on the Karelian Isthmus, so that heavy fighting may be expected to breakout again in the near future.Recent authoritative reports suggest that the weaknesses of the Red Armymay have been over-emphasised.Russian reverses in Finland have been mainly due to bad leadership, but theunsuitability of Soviet equipment to local conditions has been a contributingfactor.Red Army divisions are organised and equipped on modern lines, and relianceis placed on motor transport to a greater extent than was expected.In country, such as is found north of Lake Ladoga, modern equipment and motor transport cannot be fully exploited, and has. indeed, proved very vulnerable to attack by Finnish patrols.In defence Soviet forces have proved themselves capable of resisting frontalattacks, with the result that the Finns now direct their manoeuvres round theflanks, making skilful use of cover and their speed on skis.38. The recent fine weather has been exploited by the Soviet Air Forceand there have been numerous air attacks on towns and villages in SouthernFinland, with the obvious object of causing terror among the inhabitants.Reports of the effects on Finnish civilian morale are conflicting and it is probablytoo early to draw definite conclusions on the subject.Soviet aircraft have taken to machine gunning trains, with the result thatall railway traffic has been stopped during daylight in Southern Finland. Sovietaircraft have also increased the intensity of their attacks on Finnish munition factories recently. Repeated attempts have been made to put the ports of Hango.Turku and Vaasa out of action, apparently without success, although a steameris reported to have been sunk at Turku, which, however, did not block the harbour.[20649] c
39. The numerical superiority of the Russians in the air gives them aconsiderable advantage: for instance, Finnish troops in the north have beenfighting with the support of few anti-aircraft guns and no aircraft. Nevertheless,the low standard of Russian training prevents them from exploiting theirsuperiority fully. Few of their units have more than two crews fit for night operations, and these cannot fly by night unless the weather is clear. Russianpilots taken prisoner have stated that there has been no advanced tactical trainingagainst A.A. fire or in defence against fighters during the last year. Trainingin instrument flying has been almost non-existent. These statements appearto be borne out by the Russian failure to exploit the possibilities of night flyingoperations, and by the very low standard of bombing; the majority of their bombs have, in fact, fallen 400 to 500 yards from their assumed targets.40. On the 14th January, unidentified aircraft dropped bombs on the Kallasdistrict in Sweden, eight kilometres sc. lb. of Lulea. Russian lettering was found on fragments of these bombs. his ra ; may have been intended for Tornea, thefrontier post between Sweden and Fit land, where the Swedish volunteers areassen bling.41. Some interesting figures concerning air casualties between the1st December and the 25th December have been given by General Lundquist,Chief of the Finnish Air Force. He stated that pilots of the Finnish DXXIFokker fighters have shot down 56 Soviet aircraft without losses to themselves.During the same period, Finnish anti-aircraft units brought down 53 russian aircraft. The Finns themselves lost seven aircraft, and, in addition, it is statedthat seven Bulldog fighters and five Blenheim bombers are no longer in service.No Blenheim has been lost on the Russian side of the line.
