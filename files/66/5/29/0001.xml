MOST    SECRET, COPY NO. &quot;2*^WEEKLY REPORT (HO. 23) PIT AIR OPERATIONSAim&quot; INTSLLIGEITCE FOR THE WEEK ENDING MIDNIGHT,SUMP AY, FEBRUARY IrlTIL 19^0.Operations .Bomber Command.1.      There has been no activity during the week except forone practice sweep in the North Sea by eighteen Wellingtons on11th February0      Nothing of interest was seen.2.      Seventy-seven leaflet balloons carrying 200,000 leaf-lets were released on the nights of 7th and 8th February, for theNuremberg and Bayreuth areas .Fighter Command.3*      In the earlier part of the week there was little enemy activity, and although isolated aircraft made flights over theNorth Sea on most days there were no attacks on shipping and nointerceptions by our patrols.      There was some suspicion,  so farunconfirmed, of minelaying by enemy aircraft off East Anglia on 6th February.U.      Conditions improved greatly on and after 9th February.During the last three days of the week 2h2 patrols were flown, in-volving 653 aircraft, and it was only on the 9th and 10th that theenemy undertook any offensive action.      On that day about fifteenaircraft appeared at various points off the coast from Aberdeen-shire to the Thames toward midday, and two or three more aircraft were active in the evening.     None of the seven East Coast convoyswas attacked,  though a Heinkel was intercepted near the two Nor-wegian convoys by aircraft of Coastal Command.      There were,however, attacks on at least sixteen ships, as a result of which two minesweepers were sunk and several other vessels damaged.One Heinkel which was brought down near North Berwick was not seriously damaged and only one of the crew was injured.Another came down in the sea half-way home, and the crew took totheir dinghy, but though the Germans appear to have instituted-.. /a

/buta search as well as ourselves nothing has so far been found.One other aircraft suffered damage but seems eventually to havereached its base.5.       On 10th February there were again a considerable numberof enemy aircraft at work.      Four raids were recorded off theEnglish coast by Fighter Command at various times during thedayj    and wireless interception suggests that there were tworeconnaissance flights by at least four and ten aircraft respectively, during the morning, and that what appeared to bea bomber force of six aircraft was sent out about noon possiblyas the result of information gained by the reconnaissance.      Thefacts suggest an intention to attack a convoy or other definitetargetf, but there were no attacks except on the trawler &quot;TheresaBoyle&quot; which was sunk, and no enemy aircraft was seen by our fighters although visibility was on the whole good,      On 11thFebruary there was nothing to record beyond a single meteoro-logical reconnaissance flight.-,Coastal Command,6,        There has again been considerable anti-submarineactivity during the week.      Two special searches for submarinesreported off the North-East coast of Scotland on 5th and-9thFebruary were unsuccessful, but on 7th February a submarine was seen by a patrol of aircraft from Wick,  about 33 miles NorthEast of Cape Wrath.,      Two 100 lb, bombs were dropped directlyahead of the place where the enemy vessel had submerged.      the aim appeared to be accurate, but no damage was visible.      Thesame aircraft sighted another submarine at conning-tower depthabout two and a half hours later a considerable distance fromthe first sighting, but had no more bombs available for anattacks      On 10th February a third submarine was seen twiceduring the day rather further North in the same area and was attacked with bombs:    air and oil bubbles came to the surface^

but&apos;nothing further was seen, although the aircraft cruised forhalf-an-hour over the spot.      The same or another submarine was seen and attacked later in the afternoon without observedresult..     Six mines were sighted and marked for destructionduring the week by aircraft on convoy escort duty.7.        Various enemy aircraft were sighted during the shippingraids on 9th and 10th Februaryc     A Heinkel was seen on 9thFebruary by a battle patrol of Blenheims flying low over atrawler off the Norfolk coast, and was pursued into the clouds.On the 10th another HeinkeL was intercepted some seventy miles off the Caithness coast by two reconnaissance aircraft in theneighbourhood of the Inward and Outward Scandinavian convoys,which were then passing one anothert.      After an exchange of fire, the enemy hastily jettisoned his bombs and climbed intothe clouds, but appeared to have suffered some damage;    therewas a German News Bureau admission on the following day that aGerman aircraft had returned with the pilot severely wounded.There were a few bullet-holes in both our aircraft, and one ofthe wireless operators was slightly vrounded.8S       Flying boat searches for German vessels en route to murmansk have been pushed far up the Norwegian coast duringthis and the preceding week, but so far without result.     on 9th February a very successful reconnaissance was carried out inthe Heligoland Bight by a patrol of three Hudsons.      Three enemy destroyers, ten minesweepers and two anti-aircraft (&quot;Flak&quot;)ships were seen, and at tines considerable anti-aircraft firewas encountered.      The destroyers were sighted by one of theHudsons in the early afternoon about 35 miles South of Horns Reeif^and replied to a challenge with anti-aircraft fire.      This air-craft then photographed the ships, and proceed to attack the rear destroyer with two bombs, which fell some 30 yards ahead:it continued to circle until interrupted by a formation of eight Messerschmitt 109&apos;s, which did considerable damage tothe tail unit and rudder controls of our aircraft before.it/evaded

evaded them in cloud..    It was successful, however,  in completingits patrol and returning to its &quot;base.    About the same timeanother of our aircraft attacked one of two minesweepers seensome twelve miles from Heligoland:    its two bombs fell withinabout twenty .yards of: the target.    Forth East of Horns Reef thethird aircraft encountered a single Messerschmitt 110, which tookavoiding aetions9,       No.10 Squadron (Royal   Australian Air Force),  equipped with flying boats;, carried out their first operational taskon 6th February,  in providing air escort for a naval unit.British Air Forces in France,.10.        There is little to report.    Fighter activity waspossible only on 10th February, when five patrols were sent out bythe Air Component, without result.   .On 11th February one Blenheimof the Air Component conducted a reconnaissance northabout throughGerman territory,  landing in England, with a view to studyingactivity on the Belgian and Dutch frontiers.    Visibility was poor,but a patrol of two Messerschmitt 110&apos;s was seen near Duisburg,&apos; andnot long afterwards one attack was delivered by a single MesserschmittHO without success.    Heavy anti-aircraft fire was also ineffective.IntelligenceFrench Air&quot;Force Activity.11.        French fighter patrols have not been active during theweek5 and reconnaissance has also been much reduced.German Air.Force Activity,12,        The activity of operational units within Germany wasnormal during the week but advanced flying, training continued tobe very intensive,  particularly in navigations  night flying andblind flying. . There have been the usual amount of North Seareconnaissances, but there it, no offensive action to reportbeyond the shipping raids  of 9th February referred to in Para.7 above..      The aircraft concerned are still mainly theHeinkels of K..Gc  26 based at Lubeck and Schwerin, but

using Wester-land, in Sylt as a re-fuelling point.      They havehad occasional support from Junkers 88,rs of K..G.30, located nearHamburg, and have used aircraft of Reconnaissance Gruppe 122, fromwmnster, to search out and report moving objectives.     The twoGeschwader employed on these shipping attacks do not exceed120 aircraft in all out of a total lor.g-range bomber force ofabout 1700,  and not more than about 35 aircraft&apos;drawn fromthese units have operated on any one occasion,13,    A Heinkel which was attacked recently was reportedto have had two top rear machir.e guns instead of the usual one,A report has also been received that the Germans are increasingthe number.of guns in their bombers, and this may be regardedas a logical development 3.n view of the heavy fire they encoxiiVrter from British fighters,.Russo-Finnish War,14.    Russian, air activity during th.e   week appears to havebeen considerable; but mainly in close support of the offensive on the Isthmus front,  and there is little new to report.     the finns claim that 30.1. Russian aircraft were certainly destroyedup to the end of January, and that 31 others may have failed to regain their bases.      There are reliable reports that the numberof modern Russian aircraft in Estonia has been reduced, and thatthey have been replaced by second-line material,.15.    It is understood that an application has been made bythe Norwegian Government for the supply of Gladiators to Norway.that negotiations are on foot for the purchase of aircraft in italy, and that the Norwegian Northern Forces at Tromso may be reinforced by Curtiss fighters from the United States of America^There Is also an uncorfirmed report that Germany has recently,supplied twelve Messerschmitt&apos;109Vs. to Sweden,Italy16,. : : The Italian Under Secretary of State for Air hasproclaimed in a published article the pecessity for doublingItalian resources of pilots and aircraft,      A new- Inspectorate: &apos; .       /of

Ot the Naval Air Forces has been formed, and there are signs ofan attempt to improve anti-aircraft defences.    It appearshowever,  that substantial expansion in the near future is unlikely, as the replacement of obsolescent aircraft insquadrons is proceeding very slowly and the development ofnew types to the stage of large-scale production is hampered by shortage of raw materials.    The recent decision to delay therelease of aircraft for sale to Great Britain may well be linked with the equipment difficulties of the Italian Air Force.17.        There has been considerable unrest in Ethiopia during january,  and it is reported that there were 561raids on nativevillages and cattle during the first three weeks of the month,and that this activity still continues.Far East.18.        Japanese bombing of the Hanoi-Kunming railway hascontinued,  with considerable success.    It is doubtful if theChinese Air Force,  excluding the Russians,  now exceeds seventyfighters and twenty bombers,  and the bombing of the railway hashad. particularly serious effects on Chinese petrol supplies.Japan is reported to have succeeded recently in obtaining german aircraft for use on the Manchurian air lines:    if so,   they musthave been delivered via Siberia.    There are also reports ofconsiderable air developments in the Marshall Islands which lieclose to the American air route to &quot;the Far East from Honoluluvia Wake and Guam.
