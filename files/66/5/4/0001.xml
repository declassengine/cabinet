THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government war CABINET *SCANDINAVIA;    CAPTURE OF THE NORTHERN OREFIELDS IN THE FACE OF SCANDINAVIANOPPOSITIONoReport by the Chiefs of Staff Committee,.On the 12th January^ the War Cabinet invited usto consider the possibility of capturing the G-alivareore fields in the face of Norwegian and Swedishopposition and,  if we thought the operation to be apractical one,  to state what forces would be involved.2, The first ;phase in these operations;would be to  .capture the port of Narvik and, unless we achieved completesurprise,  the landing would be opposed.Nevertheless,  in spite of casualties and delay-wehave little doubt that we should overcome Norwegianopposition and capture the port.5. The real difficulties, however, would only beginwhen the force commenced its advance from Narvik.      Toreach Galivare the experli tion would have to undertake a150 mile advance over some of the most difficult countryin Europe.      The only line of communication inland from -Narvik is one electrified railway with many tunnels and running through precipitous country.      Great masses ofrock overhang the line which is a single track throughoutmost of its length.      The Norwegians and Swedes could easily deny its use to us by:-(i) removing rolling stock(ii) cutting off the electric power;  or(iii) demolishing the line, which hasalready been mined in six placeson Norwegian territory.6 w.M.(40) 10th Conclusions, Minute 1.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.ICQ T.P.

4. If they were to do so, we should be facedwith the formidable task not only of repairing the damagebut also of landing locomotives and rolling stock at narvik, where the port facilities might have been destroyed.     The only alternative would be to construct a first-class mountain road from Narvik to Galivare.    Thiswould be an enormous undertaking and could not possibly becompleted in time to forestall the Germans at the mines.5. Nor would that be the end of our troubles.Even if we were able to establish a line of communications,its protection and maintenance in hostile territory would bea source of serious embarrassment and would add greatly tothe size of the commitment in Northern Scandinavia.6. From the foregoing it will be seen that our chances of reaching Galivare before next winter setsin would be extremely remote   if we were faced with a hostileNorway and Sweden;    and we could not hope to forestall theGermans in a race for the Northern Orefields if the latterlanded near Lulea.If German troops and aircraft reinforce the scandinavian forces opposing us, as they well might in thecircumstances, we have no hesitation in saying that weshould be courting complete failure.(Signed)      DUDLEY POUND. &apos;2.-E.G.
