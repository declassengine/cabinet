Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1940.SECRET. 1/ Copy&quot;No.. C-kW.P. (40) 33.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.VOLUNTEERS FOR FINLAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AS requested at the Cabinet, I asked Mr. Amery to come and see me beforeluncheon to-day. I put to him very frankly the position and told him that Isaw real danger, in view of what the Prime Minister had told the Cabinet, ofthe movement getting off the rails we had laid down and considerable populardisappointment arising. I supported this argument by reference to what we were doing with regard to material, by the attitude of the French, the reactions to beanticipated both from Sweden and Germany if anything too substantial in theway of a volunteer force was to be attempted, and also by the report conveyed to us by Brigadier Ling as to the estimate that Field-Marshal Mannerheimplaced upon the immediate despatch of volunteers.I made it quite plain to Mr. Amery that for all these reasons, to which,in our judgment, great weight should be attached, we had definitely decidedto place no obstacles in the way of a British volunteer recruitment, but thison the basis that it was a component of an international force. This had beenwhat the Finnish Minister himself had desired. Our fear was that with a largecommittee including all the notables that either bad been or were about to beasked, the scale of the whole business would be so altered as to cause all concerned the maximum of embarrassment while securing the minimum of concrete result,Mr. Amery recognised the force of all this and willingly undertook to getthe committee scaled down to a small committee of six, to secure that no publicity should be given, and generally to work on the lines contemplated by the Cabinet.He undertook to see Mr. Gibson and keep him straight on this course.H.Foreign Office, January 26, 1940.10845   [20706]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
