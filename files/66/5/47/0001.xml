It hasalways boon understood in the War Office that the british expeditionary Force had been placed by General Gamelin underthe Command of General Georges,  and Lord Gort, himself, hasheld the same view.      One or two matters have recently occurredwhich threw doubt on the situation.      In order to clarify thematter, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff wrote a letterto General Gamelin,  the rcvclant extracts of which are asfollows:-&quot; I suggest that the matter of the issue oforders to the British Expeditionary Force in Francerequires clarification.7m arc- prepared to accept any reasonableconditions considered necessary by the French high command.Wo consider that it is desirable that onecondition should bo fulfilled - that is that theBritish Expeditionary Force should be under oneFrench authority.      All dual authority should be avoided.    Should the Commander-in-Chief of theBritish Expeditionary Force receive orders direct from you.  it is undesirable that an intermediateauthority such as the Commander of a Group or armies should be inserted between the british expeditionary Force and yourself.    Should you,however, decide to place the British ExpeditionaryForce under the orders of the Commander of a group of Armies;  then, in my opinion,,, the latterCommander alone should issue orders to the&apos;Commander-in-Chief of the British ExpeditionaryForce.55       55 35 55 55-1-

Tho underlying principle should ho thatthere should be no delay in tho executionof orders.2.General Game1in has rcolied as followsI acknowledge r17th inst.scoipt of your letter of theI have always considered the british expeditionary Corps in France as &quot;being directly under my orders.      I am,  in effect,  accordingto my letter of instructions.  Chief of thoGeneral Staff of the National Defence andCommandcr-ln-chief of the Land Forces, personallyaccredited for the purpose of settling all questions relating to the Allies and centralisingall our relations with them.It has never been in my mind toExpeditionary Corps under the ordersCommander of an Army Group&apos;-.put theof aIt was merely understood in order to simplify matters that General Gort could inall matters of routine service deal directly with General Georges, Commander-in-Chief of tho-French Forces on tho North-Eastern Front, whosecommand as far as operations arc concerned isanalagous at the moment to that which MarshalFctain had at the end of the last war. The past history of tho case is as follows in April, 1939-.  at the time of our Staff conversations with the French, the Chiefs of Staff considered the questionof the organisation of the Higher Command in France in war,and. they submitted a Report on the subject to the Committeeof Imperial Defence (Paper No..  D,P,(P) 50).      In this,  theysummarised the history of Allied. Command in France during thelate war, and arrived at the following recommendation:-&quot;12. Wo recommend that tho arrangements forcommand of tho Field Force should Toe based onthe subordination of its Commander to the french commander&quot;--in-Chief in France.13. Under the present organisation,  GeneralGame1in,  as Supremo Commander-in-Chief in War,v/ould have under his command two separate armies in France, besides the Army of North Africa,  theFrench Air Force,  and,  in certain circumstances,the French Navy.    It is possible that this, systemmay be altered by tho appointment of a Commander-in-Chief of the Armies in France.    In either case,In   placing the British Field Force under the

command of General Gamclin, it would bo necessary,in order not unduly to restrict his discretion inits employment, to agree to its subordination, if general Garaolin so desires, cither to the Commander-in-Ghief in Prance (if appointed) or to the- Commander of the French &quot;Army of the North-East&quot;.    &quot;if-, JThis Report was approved by the Gornriittoe of ImperialDefence25- in the following terms which wore repeated verbatimby the United Kingdom Delegation at the Staff Conversationswhen communicating the decision in writing to their Frenchcolleagues:-&quot; The arrangements for the Command of the BritishField Force, when operating on the Continent, shouldhe based on the subordination of its Commander to theFrench Commandor-in-Chief, on the understanding thatthe Commander of the British Field Force will bo at liberty to appeal to his own Government beforeexecuting any order which appears to him to imperil the British Army.      &quot;5. This proposal was agreed to by the French delegation on the 28th August, 1333--6. In the weeks immediately preceding the outbreak ofwar,  the French had not decided the exact organisation whichthey would.adopt for their Higher Command in France.      It was generally thought that there would be a Commandcr-in-Chief ofthe Armies of the North-East, who would be General Georges;and it was understood that the British Expeditionary Force,in the early stages of the war, would be under his Command.The only confirmation of this is a note from our military attache in Paris dated 3rd September, 1939, written after discussion with General Dents (then Deputy Chief of staff at the Ministcre de la Guerre).      In this note, there was adiagram which showed General Georges as coromanding the NorthEast Theatre, and it was stated :-&quot;The British Field Force will come directly underthe orders of General Georges.&quot;7. This view was in accord, with that formed &quot;by the warOffice as a result of discussions with the French Staffprior to the outbreak of war which was reflected in theinstructions issued to General Lord Gort on his assumingCommand of the British Expeditionary Force.    The relevantparagraph is as follows  :-&quot;2.      You will be under the command of the FrenchGoramon&amp;Gr-in-Chief, North East theatre of operations&quot;.8. Since the arrival of tho British Expeditionary Forcein France,  they have received orders on a number of occasionsfrom General Georges, and have dealt with his Headquarters onall matters such as the taking over of the line, the relief of French troops, etc.x   0,&apos;IcDc 368th Meeting, Minute

9. General Gamolin&apos;s reply to the letter from the Ghiefof the Imperial General Staff has apparently altered therelations Id c two en General Georges and Lord Gort and there is good reason to believe that it does not accord with theposition as at present understood by cither of them.10. Wc have given careful consideration to the situationwhich has arisen.      In our opinion, in view of terms in whichthe Government decision to place the British ExpeditionaryForce under French Command were communicated to the French,there seems no doubt that it must be left to General Gamelinhimself to decide whether the British Expeditionary force should be directly under his command or under General Georges.11. From the practical point of view the latter wouldseem operational^?- preferable whilst the British ExpeditionaryForce remains a small force operating on a part of the frontfor which General Georges is responsible and forming in factan enclave in the front allotted to one of his Groups or armies.    If in these circumstances it receives its ordersdirect from General Gamolin it may be very difficult toco-ordinate its operations with those of the French Armieson its flanks who receive their orders not oven direct fromGeneral Georges but from one of his subordinate commanders.12. On the other hand when the British ExpeditionaryForce increases to a size at all comparable to the force atthe disposal of General Georges and when its commander is inconsequence in a position to take over from General Georgesresponsibility for tin appreciable sector of the front,  therewould be every advantage in its Commander being directly under General Gamclin and eo-cqual with General Georges.13. Wc are unaware of the reasons for thiof policy on the part of General Gamelin.    It; apparent change is however vital that the Commandor-in-Chief, British Expeditionary ijorce shouldnot find himself the subject of a disagreement between twoshould not appear to query General .the safety of&quot;the British ExpeditionaryForce iiFrench Commanders, andGamolin1s decision unlessin doubt.In conclusion wc point out that -Hi..

ANNEX,..ETTER FROM THE CHIEF OP THE IMPERIAL GENERALSTAFF TO&apos; GENERAL GAMELIN.Thank you for your latter of 18th February, 1940.There was of course no doubt that the british expeditionary Force was under your orders, but His majesty&apos;s government had always understood that you had delegatedthe direct command to General Georges as commander-in-ChiefNord Esto     This was accepted and Lord Gorfs instructions were worded accordingly,,     It has always been a matter ofgreat satisfaction that relations between General Georgesand Lord Gort have been so cordial.In subordinating the British Expeditionary Force to your command,  the British Government is prepared, as Istated in my letter of 17th February, to accept any reasonable arrangement which you consider desirableaIn my own view there would be many advantages to us if the B,E.Fo were directly under your command.   At thesame time I feel that at its present strength and holdingas it does a comparatively small sector of the North EastFront, practical operational difficulties may arise if theForce is not under the commander responsible for operations on that Front.     Difficulty and delay might, in my opinionwell accrue in co-ordinating its action with that of theFrench Armies on its flanks0On the other hand when the B.E.F. reaches a sufficient strength for its commander definitely to take over fromthe Commander-in-Chief North East Front the wholeresponsibility for a definite sector of the front I canforesee every advantage in the Force being directly underyour commandoWhatever yo&quot; may decide, I would urge that yourdecision should be made known at an early date-You will appreciate that I am most anxious that there shouldbe no ambiguity as to the Commander from the Commander-in-Ohief, British Expeditionary Force receives his orders andexactly in what spheres he deals with the Commander-in-Chief,Kord EstoYou will doubtless be issuing a directive on thesubject to General Georges.     If I might have a copy i will than if necessary approach His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwith a view to amending the instructions to Lord Gort*
