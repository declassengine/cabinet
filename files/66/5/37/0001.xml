In view of forthcoming location second A.I.F. inPalestine for completion of training and equipment with modern weapons weshould be glad to have earliest possible appreciation of military situation inNear and Middle East. In particular we should like information as to possibleemployment of Australian troops in those theatres either on. active operations or temporarily on internal security duties in relief of more fully trained Britishtroops.

ANNEXURE ii draft REPLY TO THE TELEGRAM FROM THE PRIME MINISTEROF AUSTRALIA TO THE HIGH COMMISSIONER,DATED 26th JANUARY, 1940Part I.Principal British strategic interests in Middle East are First, sea route through Mediterranean, Suez Canal and Red Sea whose security depends on defence of Palestine and Egypt, and of fleet base at Alexandria. Second, theAnglo-Iranian oilfields. Third, security of North-West frontier of India which is largely dependent on existence of friendly and stable Government in Afghanistan.Fourth, we have treaty commitments to Turkejr and Iraq.Part II.Germany may advance into Balkans with Aegean coast or Bosphorus andDardanelles as her objective. Possibility of Italy joining Germany cannot be excluded. She could interfere with our sea communications and might attackEgypt and Sudan. Russia may advance, either alone or in conjunction withGermany, into Roumania and further southward. Russia may also stir uptrouble and perhaps advance into Iraq, Iran or Afghanistan.Part III.We are preparing to counter any enemy initiative, whatever form it takes.We should best defend our interests by defeating enemy advance on frontiers of Turkey and Iraq. At same time we have not sufficient fully trained and equipped forces to lock up in the Middle East numbers required to meet allpotential threats. Our reserves must be kept fluid and our further preparationsin Middle East are therefore at present confined to administrative development on scale sufficient to maintain forces likely to be required. In meantime we arealso using Middle East as training ground.Part IV.We visualize employment of Australian troops as follows. If, when theyare fit to take the field, situation should require their active employment in middle East, we should wish Australian Government to agree to that course.If on other hand situation in Middle east at that period was quiet we should wishto complete their equipment in France or United Kingdom and employ in France.It is not our intention to employ on internal security duties in Palestine, but their very presence in vicinity is expected to have salutary effect which will permit internal security duties to be carried out by smaller or less well trainedforces than at present.Part V.Cannot give at this stage any anticipated rate of provision of modernweapons and equipment. A very reasonable.training scale of these has alreadybeen provided and it is the intention to increase this to war establishment scale atleast one month before units will be considered as available for an ExpeditionaryForce.(b40/8)   60   2/40   WO.P.   4650
