THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT 265TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.S BO RET.- &quot;ff.P.(UO) 63.Also Paper ]1^0) 25lTs) &apos;). COPY NO.     nc.&apos;Also Paper Iq. C.0.SW.AR CABINET.DESPATCH OF VOLUNTEERS TO FINLAND.Report hy the Chiefs of Staff Committee.In accordance with the request of the War Cabinet55we have examined the possibility of passing &quot;volunteers&quot;through Norway and Sweden into Finland.      The proposal was that ordinary -units and formations of the Allied armed forces should be broken up into small parties for thepassage across Scandinavia and reconstituted on arrival in Finland.      The men, themselves, would thus be&quot;volunteers&quot; only in the diplomatic sense.We have examined the problem under three headings:-a) Regular Army &quot;volunteers&quot;.b) Air Forces.c) The Legal aspect.Regular Army &quot;Volunteers&quot;.2. If regular soldiers of the British Army are sent to finland in the guise of volunteers, His Majesty&apos;s government cannot absolve themselves from the responsibility of ensuring that -(i)    They are properly commanded.(ii)    Their legal status is quite clear,i,e. that, they are on active service;that they are under the MilitaryService Act;    and that they are fighting the King&apos;s enemies.(iii)    They are properly fed and clothed while on service;    looked after if sick orwounded;    and their dependants providedfor if they are killed.W.M.(kO) 39th Conclusions, Minute 6.

3. In view of the above,  it is clear that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would have to maintain any so-calledvolunteer force in all respects..     This would involve baseunits of all kinds, i.e. hospitals, etc., at Norwegianports,  and line of communication -units through Norway and sweden..     In these circumstances, the Norwegian and swedish Governments could hardly be expected to believe in.the volunteer status of the force and it, therefore,seems improbable that thev would consent to its passage(vide Stocxholm telegram lb.70 of   20th February, 1940).4.. The difficulties mentioned above could not be overcome by infiltrating so-called &quot;volunteers1&apos; in smallbodies, because this would not detract from theresponsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government for looking after them, not only in transit but also on their arrival in Finland^     Moreover, even genuine volunteers are atPresent limited to 50 per,week at any one port, so thatthe   rate of&quot;building up in Finland any appreciable force would, be far too slow to achieve our s^ject.Air Forces. 6b5* .       The War Cabinet has authorised the Secretary of Statefor Air, if he considers practical,  to carry out a schemefor the despatch of a limited number of R.A.F. personnel&apos;ona genuine volunteer basis.     The personnel would onlyproceed after resigning their commissions and engagementsin the Royal Air Force and thus would not continue to form part of His Majesty&apos;s Forces^     The number of personnelwhich could be sent in this manner is limited both by thenumber of trained crews we could spare from our reserves and by the number which the Finns could absorb into theirorganisati on-6*    ..   It is just possible that such a scheme, if supplemented by the supply of further air material, might satisfyFinnish, air requirements, especially since it is less likely toexcite German counter-action than more direct forms ofAllied assistance7o It is important to appreciate in connection withany scheme for sending Royal Air Force personnel and aircraft to Finland that they could only be withdrawn from our existing Metropolitan forces including those earmarked for Scandinavia^ at considerable risk.The Legal aspect.8. In the course of our examinour attention has been drawn to tbposition of volunteers, as definedabove, might be-called in question for instpnce, that it might be illopened upon persons who are not, aenemies&quot;. We feel that this aspegreat importance and if it is desimatter, that it should be&apos; referred the Crown for examination.^tion of this question,e fact that the legalin paras.  1 and 2It has been suggested,egal to order fire to bet the time, the &quot;King&apos;sct of the problem is ofred to proceed with theto the Law Offioers of(Signed)C.L.N.
