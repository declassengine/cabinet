MOST SECRET 5Copy-No.Memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues a translation of a memorandumhanded to me by the French Ambassador this morning advocatingthe immediate occupation of the principal Norwegian ports0H.FOREIGN OFFICE,22nd February, 1940.Translation of an Aide Memoire left with theSecretary of State by the French   ambassador on February 22nd.le   Any Allied intervention in Finland depends on theconsent of Sweden.     It is in fact enough for the Swedish G-overn-ment to cut the current which feeds the railway line Narvik-Kamiin order to bar to the Allies access to its territory, andconsequently access to Finland.2.   The Swedish Government seems equally determined not togive military aid to Finland and to refuse the use of its territory

2.territory to foreign detachments.     It is very doubtful whether thecamouflaging of Allied detachments as &quot;volunteers&quot; is enough initself to modify this attitude.5,   It is no less doubtful whether Sweden would make up for herrefusal to authorise the passage of Allied detachments by goingherself with all her forces to the aid of Finland.    The Reich hasin fact informed the Swedish Government that it would consider any official aid from Sweden to Finland as a &quot;casus belli&quot;.4.   One factor only can have any chance of modifying the positionof the Swedish Government, and that is the certainty that the allies are in a position to afford it immediate and efficacious assistance against German reaction.     It must not be a question of merepromises or even of short-term assurances.The effective presence on her very frontiers of forces readyto enter into action immediately would alone have any chance of influencing the final decision of Sweden in a favourable sense.5.   The occupation of the chief Norwegian ports and the dis-embarkation in Norway of the first echelon of Allied troops wouldgive Sweden this beginning of security.     This operation should beconceived Independently of the Finnish appeal and executed as rapidly as possible in accordance with a programme,, the lines of which havebeen laid down by the &quot;Altmark&quot; incident.6,   By authoritising,and protecting the passage in her terri-torial waters of an armed German ship carrying English prisoners,forway has gravely failed in her duty as a neutral.    The Britishgovernment has a good right to demand reparation and guarantees.The French Government considers that the British Government has a fight in law to demand the internment of the &quot;Altmark&quot; and of her crew and to notify the Norwegian Government that henceforth theBritish Government will itself exercise surveillance over norwegian waters, the inviolability of which the Government of Oslo has shown itself

itself continuously powerless to make respected.7.   If, as is very probable, this demarche meets with a refusal on the Norwegian side, the British Government, takingnote of the Norwegian failure, should immediately seize thepoints d&apos;appui which are necessary to her in order to safeguardher rights.     This occupation of Norwegian ports should be an operation suddenly carried out either by the Sritish Navy alone or with the co-operation of the French Navy, without the participation of the Allied detachments destined for Finland.It would be easier to justify this operation in the eyes of world opinion, the more rapidly it is carried out, and if our propaganda is in a position to exploit the recent complicity of norway in the &quot;Altmark&quot; incident.8.   It is not necessary to emphasise the effect which suchan operation would have in Germany and Russia, and the confusionwhich it will provoke in those countries.     English detachments,as large as possible, and accompanied if need be, by Frenchdetachments would have to be disembarked at once and established in the occupied ports in such a way that, at the moment whenthe Finnish appeal is launched, Sweden would find in their effective presence, which would guarantee the further arrival ofmore French and Polish contingents, a tangible guarantee of the aid which we could lend her if she herself goes to the aid off inland, or allows us to do so.9.   Assuming that Sweden persists in her refusal, andthat access to Finland remains closed to us, we shall benefit by having taken up a position that dominates Germany in the north;by stopping the sea transport of Swedish minerals;   by beingwithin aeroplane range of the mineral deposits;   and by being ina position to counter further developments of German and Russianenterprises

enterprises in Scandinavia.     We must not forget that our principal aim remains the cutting off of Germany&apos;s mineralsupplies, and that no Allied enterprise in Scandinavia can hejustified in regard to the general plan of the war except inso far as it tends towards this aim.10.   On the other hand there is every possibility, if wedo not exploit the &quot;Aitmark&quot; incident up to the point ofimmediately seizing guarantees and points d&apos;appui in Norway, that sweden, caught between fear of Germany and her doubts as tothe efficacy    of our assistance, will ignore Finland&apos;s appealand close her territory to us.     Any expedition projected and prepared by us will thus fail without ever having started tobe put into execution, leaving Germany, Russia and the neutralsto take note of our impotence to pass from the sphere ofwishing to the sphere of action.FRENCH EMBASSY,LONDON.February 21st, 1940.
