This new system eliminates the use of coils or anyother special fitting in ships, and consists of &apos;&apos; wiping &apos;&apos; the hull plating with ahorizontal cable, subsequently removed, carrying a heavy current. The system isalready in operation in Southampton, but, although of great promise, thepermanence of its results has not yet been established. Four &quot;wiping &quot; plantsare already on order to deal with shipping in the Tyne, Mersey, Clyde and port of London, and additional plants will be ordered if results justify it. Until,however, the success of &quot;wiping &quot; is firmly established, it would be unwise to rely on it or to neglect to press on with the one system already known to be effective.   13 Merchant vessels were &quot;Wiped&quot; at Southampton1 by March 12.Assuming that the present method remains unchanged, it is hoped thatduring the current month the rate of completion of ships will be materiallyincreased if the supply of shipyard labour can be provided.It would be a substantial advantage if part of the work of degaussingof British ships could be placed in foreign yards. The number of neutral ships engaged in trade with this country is about 700. Neutralcrews and in particular the crews of Norwegian ships are beginning to be uneasy about the dangers from enemy mines on the trade ways to our ports. The importance to us of the safety of these neutral ships and of theconfidence of their crews is a strong argument for disclosing to neutral countries the technical information which they require to demagnetise their ships which trade with this country. Disclosure might be used to induce the norwegian government to increase their allocation of tonnage to our use, to visit our ports and join our convoys.Against the substantial advantages of arranging for some British ships tobe demagnetised in foreign yards and of extending demagnetisation to neutral ships, must be set any disadvantages of a loss of secrecy. If the enemy is informed of the measures which we are taking, he may (a) increase the sensitivity of his[20824]SECRET.W.P. (40) 54.
mines, or he may (b) mix mines of opposite polarity in the same field. If secrecycould be preserved,&apos; its advantage would be to delay these reactions of the enemy.But technical details of our degaussing equipment have had to be given to allship-repairing firms in this country. Information which has been so widely distributed almost certainly becomes quickly known to the enemy.Moreover (a) and (b) have the disadvantages to the enemy that (a) would make the mines easier to sweep and reduce the damage to non-degaussed ships by placing the explosion further forward or evenahead of the ships; and(b) reversal of polarity would only be effective against certain ships whichare difficult to demagnetise thoroughly, and would also require asensitive setting of the mine.The above position has altered since the arrival of the Queen Elizabethat New York and the subsequent publicity given to the subject in the press. Theenemy now knows the nature of the protective measures we are taking and,knowing the mechanism of his own mine, it will not be difficult for him to deducethe manner in which degaussing operates. He can, therefore, now adopt any counter-measures within his power. The press notices have had the furthereffect of increasing demands for information from Neutrals and to continue torefuse such information conflicts with our general policy of encouraging neutral ships to trade to this Country.It is considered, therefore, by my advisers that we shall not be losing an advantage of any great importance by ceasing to treat the information as secret.The Admiralty recommend therefore (i) that shipyards in neutral countries be used, if necessary, to supplementresources in this country for the degaussing of British merchant ships;(ii) that technical information of our methods of demagnetisation be suppliedas and when necessary to neutral countries for the degaussing of neutral ships trading with this country. In imparting this informa-tion every effort would be made to obtain a quid pro quo.w. s. c.Admiralty, March 15, 1940.
