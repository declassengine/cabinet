THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT /    I415?Printed for the War Cabinet.  December 1943.id 4SECRETCqpy No./W.P. (43) 574.18th December, 1943.WAR CABINET.FREE SIAMESE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Commander-in-Chief, India, Supreme Commander, S.E.A.C., andS.O.E. have recently urged that we should make a declaration in favour of a free and independent Siam. The subject has been discussed interdepartmentally, andit is submitted that this course should be approved.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government have given no undertakings to Siam sincethe latter&apos;s declaration of war. But in January 1943 Chiang Kai-shek made a broadcast in which he &quot; assured the Thai people that China and her Allies hadno territorial designs on their country and no intention whatever of violatingtheir sovereignty and independence.&quot; This declaration was endorsed by president Roosevelt at a press conference, when he stated that &quot; it was adeclaration of policy of China and the United Nations/&apos; It was not so endorsed by His Majesty&apos;s Government as it was felt that such a declaration might limitour liberty of action in regard to the future of the Kra Isthmus, where there- might be political, economic or strategic reasons for establishing United Nationsmilitary, naval or air bases.3. The so-called &quot; Free Thai Movement;&apos; outside Siam is led by the SiameseMinister in Washington. It is not recognised by either His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment or the United States Government, though the latter release monthly instalments of frozen Siamese funds to cover the expenses of the movement. ABritish contingent of twenty-two Free Siamese are now in India controlled byS.O.E. for use as S.A.C.S.E.A. may decide. There is also an Americancontingent in Assam.4. Our knowledge of conditions inside Siam is derived from the variousmore or less prominent Siamese who have recently escaped to Chungking and arein touch with British sources there. It seems reasonably certain that there isin Siam a Free Siamese Movement of some considerable importance, headed byLuang Praclit (one of the Regents of Siam and a leading figure with Liberal and pro--British antecedents). It also appears that pressure is being put on theSiamese in China by the Chinese, and possibly by the Americans, to form a FreeSiamese Government under Chinese and/or American auspices. The Siamesefear and suspect the Chinese, and they are discouraged by our failure to give them any kind of support, such as they have received in the President^ andGeneralissimo&apos;s declarations. S.O.E. who are the organisation chiefly involvedup to date say that if we make such a declaration it would have a great effect in confirming the loyalty of their Siamese recruits, but that if we do not the americans will steal the game and our chances of obtaining contact with LuangPradit will be few. S.A.C.S.E.A. agrees generally. Commander-in-Chief,India, has already suggested such a declaration.5. It seems therefore desirable that we should make a declaration, phrasedm general terms, e.g., that we favour the restoration after the war of a free and independent Siam. There would be no reference to territorial integrity,in order that we should not tie our hands as regards any political, economic or strategic arrangement thought to be desirable in the interests of collective security after the war. The disavowal of territorial ambitions contained in the atlantic Charter and the recent declaration of the three Powers at Cairo is not12226   [26597]
intended to preclude such arrangements. It is also important that we shouldnot appear in any way to countenance the recent transfer to Siam of four malay states and certain areas of the Shan States in Burma. The declaration shouldnot be an appendix to -those made by President Roosevelt or the Generalissimo.It is not necessary to consult the Chinese or the United States Governmentsbeforehand, though it is intended that the latter should shortly be informed ofour general policy towards Siam, so as to encourage closer collaboration.6. The declaration would not prejudice one way or the other the questionof ultimate recognition of any Free Siamese Committee, which can be left in abeyance pending further clarification of the various complex issues involved.7. i wish, therefore, to recommend that a declaration be made as proposed above.A. E.Foreign Office, 18th December, 1943.
