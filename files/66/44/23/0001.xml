THE NEED FOR MORE JUDGES OF THE HIGH COURTMemorandum by the Lord Chancellorlo      I have reached the conclusion that the business of theHigh Court in London and at Assizes cannot be carried out with due despatch so as to meet the reasonable needs of those engaged in civil litigation without some addition to theexisting number of High Court Judges,    This Paper first sets out the reasons for this view,  and,  secondly, outlines theaction which I propose should be taken in order to meet these needs.2.      The unanimous Report of a strong Committee, preside over by Sir Ralph Wedgwood, which I recently appointed &quot;toconsider the existing facilities in England and Wales forthe instituting and trial of matrimonial causes outside london&quot; has  just been published, and has revealed a stateof things which,  in itself, would justify prompt action inthis direction.    At present, no divorce suit can be triedoutside London if the case is defended (except where thecase falls under the special arrangements made for dealingwith Poor Persons divorcesUndefended cases may be dealtwith, at Assizes, but they are exceedingly numerous, and atpresent have to be disposed of by the King&apos;s Bench Judgeswho are going Circuit,  in whatever time is available,having regard to the criminal and civil business which isthe chief concern of a Judge on Circuit.    It constantlyhappens that the list of undefended divorce cases has to begot through very hurriedly]    sometimes it is more than can be  managed in the time;    quite recently a High Court Judgeon Circuit protested at finding no less than 400 such casespresented to him for disposal when he reached the Circuittown.    This class of work on Circuit cannot,  in my judgment,be satisfactorily disposed of without the help of some additional Judges who are familiar v/ith divorce courtprocedure, ;3o      Ine present condition of things as regards defendeddivorce Gases is equally unsatisfactory,    A divorce suitwhich is to be fought out between husband and wife is pre-eminently a- proceeding which ought in many cases to be tried in a Circuit town.    The parties to the litigationlive in the same place;    their witnesses come from the   -same locality;    they usually have secured the service? oflocal solicitors.    To compel the spouses, whether innocentor guilty,  to come to London to fight the case adds very greatly to the expense and often means serious delay which ought to be avoided.    It is within the power of theLord Chancellor by Order to provide that defended divorcecas.3 may be tried in the provinces, but such an order would be wholly negative unpegs there are enough JudgesTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET v/X: a1h5) Jl*7&quot;3. copy  N0---l-.C      1&apos;7th DECEMBER -   1945WAR CABINET

going Circuit to try such cases,      Theprobable length of timeto be occupied, by a contested divorce case is very difficult toestimate in advance, and such- cases often have to be investigatedin detail and with the evidence of many witnesses8      It would be quite impossible to throw this task upon the existing strengthof Judges going Circuit, and the whole arrangement of the Circuittimetable would be thrown into confusion if it was attempted,,4W.     The situation as regards divorce cases which I have described above is greatly aggravated &quot;by war conditions,,    During the last18 months there has been a largo rise in the number of divorcesuits which have been instituted, and which? sooner or later, mayhave to be tried,      A very considerable proportion of theseinvolve members of the Forces.      The number of cases now enteredis something like -3 &apos; to 4,000o      It is very hard on a servingsoldier to have to wait for an indefinite time before thiscrisis in his domestic&apos; affairs is settled,,      If he gets leave andcomes home, this may very well lead to condonation which will destroy the rights of the innocent party to a decree,,      It is necessarythat cases involving members of the forces should be dealt withwhen the individual concerned is available, and here againadditional judicial strength is  the only line of reliefcb0      I have caused the most careful inquiries to be made in orderto ascertain whether this congestion in the divorce court lists islikely to be temporary, and those who have the best means ofjudging assure me that this spate of divorce cases is not likelyto fall off for a long time       It is hardly possible to estimatemere remote developments^ but it is to bo feared that war conditions do not, on the whole, favour a wider respect for the marriage tie, &apos; ,60      Down to this point I have referred only to the pressure ofcases in the divorce courte      There is, however, also a good dealof regrettable delay in disposing of various lists in the King&apos;bench Division,,        At the present moment,  this delay is aggravated by the illness of a number of Judges, and indeed the High Courtworks on a very narrow margin of strength at the best of times0There is no such delay in the Chancery Division, where the work has fallen off, though, here again, the illness of a Judge or twowould make all the differencecV0      Such being an impartial statement of the present situation, &apos;I have a proposal to make0      In the past, when an addition has hadto be made to the minimum number of High Court Judges, the practicehas been to authorise the addition by reference to the state ofbusiness in a particular Division of the High Court, e0gfc.  theKing&apos;s Bench Division or the Probate, Divorce and admiralty division, and to use this authority to appoint a new Judgespecifically to that Division^      Thus the King&apos;s Bench Divisionnow consists of the Lord Chief Justice and 17 puisnes, but thenumber of puisnes in that Division might be brought up to 19 if thestate of business ^n^^tha.t DiyJ.Tsion required that the vacanciesshould be filled, on the,- passing of a Resolution by both houses of Parliament-,      Again, the Probate, Divorce and. admiralty division no?/ consists of the president and 4 puisnes, but if a vacancy occurred it could only be filled by the passing of aResolution which again has to be based on the state of businessjjajshat Division^     In my opinion, this is a very bad method ofincreasing &quot;aizuTcial strength.      The reforms in the &apos; 70s of thelast century, under which the Courts of Queen&apos;s Bench, CommonPleas and Exchequer were ultimately amalgamated, really aimed atcreating a single High Court, the Judges of which were to befreeljr interchangeablec     Even as things are, every Judge of theHigh Court may be required, with the consent of the head of hisDivision, to help in another Division if the state of-work there

requires it, though for practical reasons Chancery Judges usuallyconfine themselves to Chancery business,,      But the right system, Ithink, is not to provide for an additional Judge to be appointed to aparticular Division, after work in that Division has got so behindhandthat it has proved to be for the time being under-staffcd, but toauthorise, under proper conditions of control, that such supplementary&quot;appointments should be made as are required&apos; generally for the HighvCourt as a whole.      There is an additional reason in the case of theDivor&apos;ce court why the method I propose is to be preferred,,    While itis really- obvious that there are not enough Judges available fordivorce cases in present circumstances, I should feel much hesitation in proposing to nominate further individuals from the divorce Baralone who would undertake nothing but divorce work during theirjudicial lives.      We shall get a better standard cf Judge and give him a more tolerable life if there is the whole Bar to choose from,and if the new Judge or Judges do not feel that they are condemned tothis particular class of business till they have earned their pension,,In short, there should be a freer interchange of Judges from time totime between the different Divisions of the High Court,, and, as far as-possible, High Court Judges should be regarded as being in a commonpool,8,      My proposal, therefore, is as follows.      More Judges, as I haveshown, are urgently needed - at present this is primarily in errorto deal with the Divorce list, though the need may equally well sh:witself in other branches of work, such as the King&apos;s Bench or perhapsAdmiralty,      Instead of new legislation authorising this limitedaddition, I propose that the existing Statute lav/ which enables thenumber of Judges in a particular Division to be increased withinstated limits, should be repealed and the new Statute should dealcompendiously with the whole matter.      If the congestion in dealingwith divorce cases, which now-exists and which will continue at anyrate for a considerable time, is to be overcome, there must be an addition of three more judges, and the legislation which I proposewould cover this,9a     At present, Parliament has authorised the addition of two Judgesto the King&apos;s Bench Division if certain conditions are satisfied, and,on a vacancy occurring in the probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division,has authorised that vacancy to be filled hy the same means0     The newStatute should, in my opinion, while repealing these existing provisionsput in their place an authority to appoint a maximum of sis additional judges over and above the numbers now existing,      I would then at oncemake the Order which would enable contested divorce cases to be triedat Assizes and would, subject to the control proposed in the nextparagraph, appoint the three extra Judges which are needed,10,     I recognise that Parliament may be unwilling to give to theLord Chancellor of the day power to make these further appointmentsupon his own&quot;judgement, and what I should hope would be that theStatute would require the agreement of the Chancellor of the Exchequerbefore an addition can be made.      This is the nature of the controlalready existing   by Statute in one case of addition;    in the otherr^se a Resolution of both Houses of Parliament is required before an^addition can be ,made.      It seems to me that an agreement between theLord Chancellor and the Treasury, without any Parliamentary Resolution,is much to be preferred.      If we have in the future to proceed by parliamentary   Resolution, this means that the Lord Chancellor andthe Attorney General have to wait until by the increasing accumulation of causes waiting to be disposed of, with consequent complaint fromlitigants and solicitors, a case is piled up which obviously has  tobe met^     But prevention is better than cure.     In fact, this countrycarries through its judicial business with a smaller number of superiorJudges than any country in the world of comparable size and importance,and it is, in my opinion,  a very false view of economy unduly to limit the number of Judges and thereby keep the business and domesticinterests of the country waiting for long periods before they can get their disputes settled and their rights    ascertained,,-3-
