THE AXIS OIL POSITION IN EUROPE-NOVEMBER  1943.Report by the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee.THERE is attached a report* upon the oil position in Axis Europe-whichhas been prepared by the Technical Sub-Committee on Axis Oil, of which sir Harold Hartley is Chairman. The report covers the eight months ended the 31st August, and also includes a forecast of the position for the six month sending the 1st March, 1944.2.   The report emphasises the following points : (a) Up to the end of August the oil position has continued to be extremelystrained and stocks were then at about the same low level as at thebeginning of this year.(b) The savings in distributional requirements due to losses of territory arelikely to be offset to a large extent by additional commitments inother directions.(c\ An improvement in supplies may be possible during the next few monthsby Germany acquiring Italy&apos;s former oil imports and by increasingthe output of the synthetic plants.(d) The. position is extremely sensitive to dislocation and the importanceof refineries as targets has become greatly enhanced.3. We agree the findings of this report and we would reaffirm that it isclear from intelligence that oil continues to cause the Germans serious anxiety.It appears improbable that there has been any important&apos; improvement in theposition since August, and we agree that any major interference with Germany&apos;soil resources would seriously weaken her ability to continue the war,4. In particular we would emphasise the vulnerability of the refineriesin Central Europe and the Balkans and the special importance as targets of thosesituated at nodal transport points on the petroleum supply lines, e.g., Vienna,Regensburg, and Budapest; though in the case of Budapest the question shouldbe considered in conjunction with the policy for bombing of objectives in hungary.(Signed) V.

Summary of Conclusions.1. German plans to provide adequate supplies of oil in 1943 have failed to attain their objective. The construction of synthetic oil plants is behindschedule; the programme for further conversions to substitute fuels has notresulted in important additional savings; and the Allied offensives have forcedconsumption to levels that have not permitted any restoration of the depletedstock position.2. During the eight months ended the. 31st August, 1943, oil production hasapproximately equalled - consumption and losses. Stocks therefore remain unchanged at the January level, which at that time was considered to be littlemore than the minimum required to maintain distribution, namely 4,000,000 tons.*3. The savings in distributional requirements due to losses of territory arelikely to be offset to a large extent by the additional oik immobilised in establishingmilitary reserves to meet both the threat of fresh Allied assaults and thepossibility of interruptions to communications.4. During the six months ending the 1st March, 1944, Germany may be ableto add rather-more than 1,000,000 tons to her resources, provided that &apos;(a) Italy&apos;s former oil imports are acquired (500,000 tons).(&amp;) Progress is made with additions to synthetic oil production capacity(250,000 tons).(c) The losses of oil stocks which were caused by Allied attacks during thefirst eight months of 1943 do not recur (400,000 tons). -5. However, the position is now more vulnerable than at any previous timefor the following reasons :  (a) The Allied advances in Italy and Russia have brought all the principalsources of oil within range of air attack.(b) The refining capacity of South-Eastern Europe is at present barelysufficient to meet requirements. Any substantial reduction in this capacity would not only entail the transport of crude oil to refineriesremotely situated elsewhere in Europe but, as a large proportion of oil products are consumed in Eastern Europe, a major re-organisationof oil distribution would also be involved. The position is extremelysensitive to dislocation and the importance of refineries as targets hasbecome greatly enhanced.6. The insufficiency of oil stocks is still causing Germany grave anxiety, andany substantial interference with her oil supplies would seriously weaken herability to continue the war.Deduction.We should, as far as circumstances will permit, use every endeavour this winter to destroy as much of the enemy&apos;s oil resources as possible.* This figure was originally considered to be about 3 million tons, but has been amended to 4 million tons as a result of the American-British discussions.
REPORT.Our last report on the Axis Oil Position in Europe (J.I.C. (43) 253)* covered the six months ended the 1st May, 1943. A further statement on the position wasmade in July when the conclusions arising from a series of conversations withthe Representatives of the United States Enemy Oil Committee were reported(J.I.C. (43) 312).t In view of the changes that have occurred in Europe since these reports were issued, the following report is now submitted.Introductory.In our report for the six months ended the 30th April, 1943, it was pointedout that the oil position was uncomfortably tight and not likely to improvesubstantially until either &quot;the new synthetic oil plants came into large-scale production or until Italy went out of the war. It was clear from intelligencethat Germany was regarding her. oil position at that time with considerable anxiety. , &apos;We envisaged the, possibility that, if the construction of additional synthetic oil output capacity proceeded, at a rate that would result in an increase in production of a million tons a year by the end of September, and if the capitula-tion of Italy resulted in Germany acquiring additional oil equivalent to a million tons a year, the position would then be eased to an important extent.- On the otherhand, if the new synthetic plants did not add substantially to supplies until sometime after the rate of military consumption had reached the 1942 figure, and if italy remained in the war, it was considered that Germany&apos;s oil structure wouldbe stretched to the utmost.Developments during the First Bight Months of 1943.Total stocks of oil at the beginning of this year were considered to be at sucha low level that further&apos; withdrawals to make up any material deficit betweenproduction and consumption were no longer possible without causing stoppagesin distribution. This level was originally considered to be about 3,000,000 tonsbut was amended to 4,000,000 tons in July as a result of the American-Britishdiscussions. The tabulation in Annex I now shows that up to the end of Augustintake and consumption had approximately balanced, stocks remaining practicallyat the January level. An addition to supplies Of 400,000 tons would have occurred in these eight months if this quantity of oil had not been destroyed by Alliedattacks.During this period, however, territorial changes have occurred that will havehad some effect upon tied stocks and the distributional minimum. The retreatson the Russian and Mediterranean Fronts will have resulted in eliminating themilitary and non-military tied stocks in the areas evacuated. On the other hand,the additional military reserves required. to meet the threat of Allied assaults,and the growing uncertainty of communications, will have resulted in increases in the quantity of oil immobilised in stock. It is therefore considered that thenecessary distributional minimum remains virtually unchanged.Evidence of Strain.It is evident from current intelligence that oil is continuing to cause Germanygreat anxiety. Information recently obtained from members of the ItalianGeneral Staff confirms that the shortage of liquid fuel constitutes a majorpreoccupation of the German High Command.Non-military consumption has recently had to be restricted still further.Allowances of oil to the occupied countries, already small, have again been reduced and apparently without regard to the economic difficulties that must inevitably be arising. -In the case of the armed forces, allocations to non-operational army units have been further restricted &quot;and increasing reliance is being placed, uponproducer-gas for the operation of military vehicles. The inadequacy cf the fuelallowances for the individual training of drivers, and for exercises, is a constantsource of complaint.        &apos;The shortage of bunker fuel for German Naval vessels has ^resulted inactivities having to be principally confined to essential escort duties. The lackof oil is reflected in further conversions to coal-firing.* J.I.G. (43) 340-Annex A. f J.I.C. (43) 840-Annex B.
In the case of the G.A.F. there have not been the reports of shortages of aviation spirit at flying schools that were prevalent last year. However, the increasing conversion of G.A.F. ground units to producer gas points to a growingstringency of motor fuel. .   &apos;The A attack upon the Roumanian Refineries.The attack upon the Roumanian refineries on the 1st August has resulted inthe elimination, for such time as it will take for repairs to be carried out, of thesurplus refining capacity in Roumania. The refining capacity of Central and eastern Europe is, in fact, now working at maximum pressure and is barelysufficient to treat the production forthcoming from Roumania, Austria, hungary and Poland. Any substantial reduction in this capacity would not only entail the transport of crude oil to refineries remotely situated in Italy or northern europe but, as a large proportion of oil products are consumed in Eastern Europe,a major reorganisation of oil distribution would be involved.The position is extremely sensitive to dislocation, and the importance ofrefineries as targets has become greatly enhanced.  (See page 23.)The Collapse of Italy. -The defection of Italy has relieved the Axis of an annual oil commitmentequivalent to approximately 1,000,000 tons. Immediate advantage of this wind-fall, in&quot; the form of diverting to Germany Italy&apos;s former share of Roumanian oil,has been partly mitigated by the dislocation at Ploesti. Nevertheless germany should now be acquiring approximately 80,000 tons- a month of oil that formerlywent to Italy. If these supplies can be maintained, and safeguarded from inter-ference from the new Allied bases in Italy,&apos; they will be an important additionto Germany&apos;s resources.   (See page 25.)The Future Trend.The following indicates the possible future trend of production and consumption, the period covered being the six months from the 1st September,1943, to the 29th February, 1944.The Production Trend.The production of crude oil from all sources, in terms of finished products,is at present at the rate of rather less than 8,500,000 tons a year (see Annex II).The declining trend in the output of Roumania and Poland is likely to be offset by increasing production from Austria. Hungary is capable of increasing herproduction but the Hungarian Government has so far apparently shown noinclination to supply the Germans with any larger quantities of oil than hitherto.Assuming, therefore, that Hungary does not change her present attitude, noimportant increase in the output of mineral oil is to be expected during the nextfew months.The output of synthetic oil is currently estimated at the fate of about,400,000 tons per annum. Assuming that the existing plants continue to operate at their present level of efficiency, any inci&apos;eases in output will be principallydependent upon the completion of the Briix plant and of the two plants atBlechhammer. There has, however, been a notable slowing down in the con-struction of these plants and in the additions being made to certain existingplants (see Annex II). Consequently there are no means of measuring theadditional output capacity that may be available early in 1944. It is, however,regarded as improbable that the additional annual productive capacity available by next February will exceed 600,000 tons; as this increase will occurgradually, the actual improvement in supplies during the six months ending the29th February next is unlikely to exceed 250,000 tons.The output of substitute fuels is estimated to be equivalent to an annual rate of 2,670,000 tons. Whereas there is scope for potential increases in the useof alcohols, the uses to which they can be put appear to be limited.On the assumption that the present output of oil from all sources is main-tained, the position may become improved, during the six months ending the29th February, as follows :-Tons.(1) By the oil that was formerly imported by Italy ...       ...      500,000(2) By increases in synthetic oil production, say   ...       ...      250,000(3) By the non-recurrence of the losses of oil stocks by allied attacks that occurred during the first eight months of 1943, say      ...       ...      ...       ...       ...      400,000
Consequently it may be possible for Germany to add rather more than,000,000 tons to her resources during this period.The Consumption Trend.The oil consumption of the armed forces has been running at high figuresthroughout the summer and autumn. Judging by the level of consumption last winter, and by the present trend of events, it is reasonable to expect the figures will not decline to any important extent before February next. (See Notes 1 and 2below.)While further reductions are possible in the allocations of liquid fuel fornon-military purposes in Germany, it is evident from the limitations alreadyimposed upon the supplies to the armed forces that such reductions would imperil the economic stability of the home front. Consumption in Roumania and hungary continues at a high level; German attempts to reduce the domestic consumption of these countries have been unavailing, and any drastic diversion of these supplies is unlikely.Conclusions wpon the Future Trend.- German plans to provide for adequate supplies of oil in 1943 have failedto attain their objective. The output of synthetic oil has not increased asexpected, the programme for further conversions to substitute fuels has . notresulted in important additional savings, and the Allied offensives have forcedconsumption to levels that have not permitted any restoration of the depletedstock position.While a valuable addition to supplies, should result from the collapse ofItaly and an appreciable increase in synthetic production can still be antici-pated, the future position is dependent upon the maintenance of present sources of supply, and particularly upon the oil resources of Roumania and Hungary.The contribution of these satellite countries remains as important as ever, andit will be seen from Annex VII that it is equivalent to almost half the total requirements of the German army. Moreover, Germany is now confronted with,the fact that the Allied advances in Italy and Russia have brought all theprincipal sources of oil within range of air attack. The consequent threat torefineries and synthetic oil plants, combined with the growing uncertainty ofmaintaining communications (e.g., the traffic interruptions with Northern Italy)imposes upon Germany the problem of having to build up reserves of a productalready in deficient supply.The present position is vulnerable and any substantial interference withGermany&apos;s oil economy would seriously weaken her ability to continue the war.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee:H. HARTLEY, Chairman.Note 1.A reduction in Axis consumption of about 55,000 tons per month has resulted from the elimination of the Italian armed forces. This saving is taken into account under the heading of the additional supplies available to Germany.Note 2.It may be expected that savings in consumption may result from reductions in thenumber of fuel-consuming units in operation, such reductions being due to a possible falling off in the output of new vehicles, lack of rubber, losses in battle, &amp;c. Such reductions are,however, omitted from these calculations, since such a shortage would be correspondinglyweakening to the Axis position.
ANNEX I.The Statistical Position.In the discussions with the Representatives of the United States Enemy OilCommittee in July (J.I.C. (43) 312) it was agreed that stocks at the beginning of1943 were at such a level that further withdrawals to make up any material deficitbetween current supply and consumption were no longer possible. There was a difference of opinion upon the probable size of these stocks and a compromisefigure of 4,000,000 tons was agreed upon. The estimated statistical position forthe first eight months of the year is as follows : 1st JanuarySlst August, 1943(in metric tons).Stocks as at 1st January, 1943         .......;.      ... 4,000,000Production           .........       ............ 11,002,000*Consumption (see Annex III)  . --&apos; .        15,002,000Civil   ......     ....      .............     ... 4,992,000Losses from evaporation and leakage! ...       ...       ... 40,000Armed Forces &apos;(i) Armies       ......       ......       2,602,000(ii) Naval        ............       1,247,000   \(hi) Air Forces .........       1,330,000.(iv) Todt organisation    &apos; ... 320,0005,499,000Exports to Neutrals       ................... 40,000Losses  . .From destruction of stocks in Germany,Roumania and Italy by air attacks... 150,000Stocks lost in the retreats on the russian and Mediterranean Fronts    ...       ... 150,000Loss by tanker sinkings   ...       ...       ... 100,000400,00010,971,000Leaving a balance of       ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 4,031,000These figures indicate that during these eight months intake and consumptionhad practically balanced, permitting no improvement in the depleted stock position.During this period, however, territorial changes have occurred that will havehad some effect upon tied stocks and the distributional minimum. The retreatson the Russian and Mediterranean Fronts will have resulted in eliminating themilitary and non-military tied stocks in the areas evacuated. On the other hand,the additional military reserves required to meet the threat of Allied assaults andthe growing uncertainty of communications, will have resulted in increases in thequantity of oil immobilised in stock. It is therefore considered that the necessarydistributional minimum remains virtually unchanged.* The following calculation has been made to arrive at the estimated production for the eight months ended the 31st August, 1943:  Tons.Annual rate of production (Appendix A) ...     &apos; ...       ...       ...       ...       16,541,700Deduct &apos;Synthetic oil production: Blechhammer Plants    ... 150,000Albania: Crude oil (in terms of finished products) ... 90,000Italy: Alcohol, &amp;c................ 29,000 269,000Adjusted annual rate      ....      ...      ...      ... ...       ... 16,272,700Equivalent to production for eight months of       .... ...       ... 10,848,400Add-^Synthetic oil production, Blechhammer South      ... 35,000Albania: Crude oil       ...       .........       ... 90,000Italy: Alcohol, &amp;c.    .   ......       .......... 29,000 154,000Total production for the eight months ...       ...       ...       ...       11,002,400t 1  per cent.

ANNEX II.Estimate of. Oil Production for 1943.In Appendix A are shown the estimates of the yields, in terms of finished products, from the production of oil in Axis-occupied Europe for the year 1943.The total of 16,542 million tons compares with the annual rate of 16,954 million tons given in our last report for the six months ended the 30th April, 1943, andcomprises : &apos; .    Annual Rate inThousands of metric tons.6 months to1943. 30th April,19A31. Crude and shale oil production      ...      8,496 8,3662. Synthetic oil production       ......      5,376 4,8643.

Substitute and miscellaneous oils    ...      1,080 1,886Total......      ...     16,542 16,954Crude Oil Production.Hanover Fields, Germany.The previous estimate of 450,000 tons for the whole of the Hanover fields hasbeen revised on the assumption that the rate of increase of production in the Nien-hagen area since 1938 has been 4 per cent, per annum. compared with a yearlyincrease of 4-5 per cent, and 3-5 per cent, in 1937 and 1938 respectively. It isknown that the development of the Eicklingen field has made considerable progress.Production from the smaller outlying fields is estimated at 120,000 tons perannum. The output for the whole Hanover area is, therefore, assumed to be,atthe rate of 560,000 tons per annum. Production is likely to be maintained at a level rate. &quot;Reitbrook Field, Germany.Peak production is assumed to have been reached during the period of maximum drilling activity in 1941, when, it is estimated, production was 257,000tons compared with about 140,000 tons in 1939. As some drilling was shown byaerial photographs to be in progress in 1942 it is assumed that the nett decline in production during that year was only 15 per cent. The decline in 1943 is put at30 per cent. Production for 1943 is therefore put at 144,000 tons compared withthe previous estimate of 240,000 tons.  The trend is declining.Heide Field, Germany.Air cover in May 1943 showed that this field had been delimited and thatdrilling activity comprised inter-spacing between existing wells. The number ofdrilling wells was smaller in May 1943 than in February 1942 and the field is assumed to have passed its peak. The former estimate of 50,000 tons is main-tairied for 1943, and this figure corresponds with such intelligence as is available.Production is probably declining.Rhine Valley Fields, Germany.No important activity has been revealed by air cover. Photographs of thefield near Forst show that no new drilling was in progress. Production in 1939was estimated at 18,000 tons and, assuming an annual decline of 10 per cent.,current production is taken to be 12,000 tons. The fact that there have been no reports of activity in the Rhine Valley may afford some confirmation of this figure.- Unknown German Fields.It is known that drilling activity is taking place in various parts of Germanyand there are numerous structures- to be tested. A figure of 100,000 tons hasbeen included to cover possible production from areas not known to us.[26407] \   - c    .
Austria.The 1943 estimate of 1,200,000 tons covers the following fields :-ZistersdorfGaiselberg    ...Kreuzfeld     ...Prinzendorf / St. Ulrich1,238,000 (approx.)This estimate is the result of photographic reconnaissance made in August1943, together with a certain amount of information gained from intelligence.The figures for Zistersdorf and Gaiselberg are probably reasonably accurate,but the outputs for. the Kreuzfeld and Prinzendorf structures are dependentupon a number&apos; of factors not yet known to us. The total estimated output of1J million tons for 1943 corresponds with the consensus of intelligence reports.Air reconnaissance has shown that the large field at Prinzendorf is being actively developed and that the producing limits of the area have not yet beendefined. It is considered probable that Flysch production was discoveredshortly before the war and it is therefore considered logical to assume that thePrinzendorf field has been in process of development for some time. Upon theassumption that a number of drilling strings were one up to 1940, two duringthe next two years and fifteen during 1943, it is estimated that 136 producingwells have been obtained. Allowing for an initial production of about 300 tons per r day falling rapidly to about 17 tons per day by the second month (viz.,about 1.150 tons for the first month and 500 tons for the next two months) withthe oldest wells producing only 3 tons per day, it is calculated . that 1943production will be about three-quarters of a million tons. It may be that production has not yet quite reached this level but, subject to further studies ofthe available evidence, it is proposed to adopt the figure of 750,000 tons for.1943.The field is being developed rapidly, and further reconnaissance will benecessary at a reasonably short interval if the rate of development is to be assessed. Production from Prinzendorf is probably capable of attaining a figure of 1-4 million tons in 1944, in addition to which it is probable that thereare prospects of new production in other parts of the Vienna Basin.Czechoslovakia.Production is estimated at 32,000 tons per annum.Poland. .Figures of production of.the fields in East and West Poland which havebeen received for a number of months, indicate an annual total production of360,000 tons. In addition, the production of natural gasoline is believed to amount to approximately 40,000 tons, making a total figure of 400,000 tons.Although there may be ultimate prospects of increased production in Poland, thepresent trend is a declining one.France.It is likely that the small production at Pechelbronn has declined ratherthan increased. It is considered that the annual production, which was 80,000tons in 1942, does not now exceed a rate of 70,000 tons.H ungary.It is believed that a continued policy of rapid exploitation would Shaveresulted in the output for 1943 reaching a level of about 1\ million tons.However, notwithstanding the fact that this quantity of oil might be available,as so many reports have been received denoting that production has been restricted and that the policy of the Hungarian Government has been to conserveoil resources, the annual rate of output is considered to be about 800,000 tons.If there should be a change of policy, an appreciably larger output should bepossible.    , .     .Tons.63,000360,00065,000 (approx,)750,000 (approx.)
Yugoslavia.Total production is estimated at 50,000 tons.Albania. ,It is now known that the total production of Albania for the first eight months of 1943 was approximately 100,000 tons. The crude has been processedby simple distillation.Roumania.Evidence points to a declining trend and the total output for 1943 isestimated at 5,450,000 tons, of which 200,000 tons is natural gasoline. the attack upon the refineries on the 1st August may have had an adverse effect upon output although detailed information upon output during August and september is not yet available.Shale Oil.The estimate of Estonian shale oil is based on a reliable report that produc-tion was 40,000 tons for first six months and will be about 55,000 tons duringthe second half of 1943.The estimate for French shale oil is likely to be approximately correct.Synthetic Oil Production.The estimated capacities of the various plants are detailed in Appendix B.The figures are based upon the results of aerial reconnaissance and givethe estimated rate of capacity of these plants for the year 1943.The output of these plants will have- been affected to a greater or lesser degree by adverse factors due to war conditions.A study of the losses of production caused by direct damage that has been observed in photographs during 1943, indicates a loss of output from the fourplants where damage has been observed equivalent to 20,500 tons.To cover reductions in output due to direct damage, and also to transport,equipment, raw material and labour difficulties, the following factors have been applied :  -Per&apos;cent.(a) Plants in areas seriously dislocated by heavy attacks       ;..      15(b) Plants in areas less seriously dislocated        ...       ...       ....       2^(c) Plants in areas where there have been no important attacks      Nil ,Construction Progress.During the past summer there has been a marked slowing down in theprogress of the construction of new plants and of extensions to existing plants.The following shortages in equipment have been observed :-^High Pressure Reaction Vessels and Equipment:- Blechhammer North, Brux, Magdeburg, Politz, Wesseling, TroglitzZeitz.CO. Conversion Plant-Brux, Blechhammer North.Refinery Equipment Blechhammer North.Refinery Pipe Connections Blechhammer North.There has been a slowing up in general construction progress at theBlechhammer and Brux Plants, and apparently a cessation of huilding atWesseling. &apos;   - ,With reference to the shortage of high-pressure reaction vessels, thfefollowing table indicates the quantities available and required:-Number of stallsequipped between april 1942 and. .

It appears unlikely that the present total output capacity of the threeplants will be increased by more than, say, 600,000 tons during the six month sending the 29th February next. As this increase would be progressive, theadditional oil obtained would not be more than about 250,000 tons.Utilisation of Hydro-Carbon Gases. 4In Appendix C is tabulated a possible distribution of the hydro-carbon gasesassumed to be available from the hydrogenation plants. This table shows a balance of 634,000 tons unaccounted for. It is believed that an appreciableproportion of this surplus is used in the manufacture of synthetic chemicals.ANNEX III.Estimate of Consumption by Civilian and Industrial Users.1st January-Slst August, 1943.The estimated oil consumption by non-military users during the eight months ended the 31st August, 1943, is detailed in Table I at the end of this Annex.Greater Germany (1).The following table shows the average monthly rate of consumption bycivilian and industrial users for the period under review, compared with ourestimates for the six months ended the 30th April, 1942 : Monthly Average of Eight Months.(In thousands of Metric Tons.)0	Motor Spirit, &amp;c.

(a) Lorries. - - - .It is estimated that at the end of June 1943, in addition to the lorriesoperating on Producer Gas, the following lorries were in use : (i) On Petrol: 19,000 at 3-5 tons p,a. ^ 66,500 t.p.a.(ii) On Diesel oil: 69,000 at 9 tons p.a. = 621,000 t.p.a.(iii) On Bottled Gas : 66,000 at 3 tons p.a = 198,000 t.p.a.The combined consumption of petrol and bottled gas is therefore264,500 t.p.a. or 22,000 tons per month. To allow for the fact that the 40,000conversions effected between January and June would not have been completeduntil the end of June, an addition of 50,000 tons is made, or an average for the 8 monthly period of 6,250 t.p.m. The 40,000 conversions are estimated to have all but completed the target figure of civilian conversions planned under the conversion scheme, and it is thought that comparatively few conversions will havebeen made since June (see Annex IV).In addition to the Diesel oil used by the 69,000 lorries, 3 tons of Diesel oilper lorry is consumed by the 25,000 lorries which are estimated to have been converted to &quot; Producer Gas cum Diesel oil.&quot; The total consumption of Dieseloil by lorries is thus 621,000 plus 75,000 tons, equivalent to 58,000 tons per month.(Note.-The Diesel oil now contains a high proportion of gasoline; for thepurpose of these statistics the blend is regarded as Diesel oil.)(b) Motor Cars and Cycles.It is estimated that 190,000 and 42,000 cars are operating on petrol andbottled gas respectively. At an average annual consumption of 1-15 tons, the motor car consumption is equivalent to 22,200 tons per month. The petrolconsumption of 800,000 motor cycles is estimated at 56,000 tons or, say, 4,800 tons per month, making the combined monthly figure for cars and cycles 27,000 tons.(c) Omnibuses.There is little evidence as to how far omnibus services have been affected by&apos;wartime conditions, but on the assumption that the total number now operatingis 14,000, of which 2,000 are running on Town Gas, and 12,000 on Diesel oil, theliquid fuel consumption is estimated at 14,000 tons per month. About 20,000omnibuses were in service before the war.(d) Tractors.     .It is assumed that of the 110,000 tractors, 40,000 are operated on ProducerGas and 70,000 on liquid fuels. At 2J tons per. tractor per year, the total liquidconsumption would be 175,000 tons, or an average of about 14,000 tons per month.As very little agricultural work will have been done during the months of january and February, the monthly average during the first eight months is estimated at12,000 tons, divided between Gas/Diesel oil and Kerosine in the ratio of 7 to 5.(e) Industrial Black Oils.In our May report consumption was estimated at the rate of 32,000 tons per month. However, it is now considered that the production of the necessarygenerating plant has not been sufficient to bring about the high rate of conversionof diesel-driven stationary engines which had been assumed. It is therefore now estimated that for the eight months under review consumption was at the rateof 36,000 tons per month. Of the 36,000 tons, 12,000 relates to Gas /Diesel oiland 24,000 tons to Fuel Oil.(f) Bunkers.It is estimated that the Danube Shipping is operated chiefly on Diesel oilas far as liquid fuels are concerned, and that consumption remains at the levelof the estimate of 240,000 tons per year given in our May 1943 Report. A small increase has been allowed, in our estimates of Inland Shipping consumption tocover some oil used in vessels converted to producer gas; in previous calculationsthis had not been allowed for.As most of the fuel oil burning vessels of the Mercantile fleet have been eitherlaid up or converted to coal burning, our monthly estimate has been reduced from12,000 tons of fuel oil to 2,000 tons. The Diesel oil estimate remains at 3,000 tons per month. .
(g) Gasoline for Testing Aero-Engines.The estimate is unaltered at 3,000 tons per month.(h) and (i) Kerosine and Lubricating Oils.The average monthly consumption is thought to be at the level of our previousestimates, namely, 8,000 tons and 50,000 tons respectively. The figure of50,000 tons includes regenerated oils. -(k) Asphalt.The figure of 20,000 tons per annum compares with the current productionestimates.   No intelligence is available upon present consumption.Czechoslovakia, Poland and Danzig (2 and 3).Estimates are based upon the assumption that current consumption is atthe same percentage of pre-war consumption as in Germany, namely, about 42 percent.Finland (4).It was believed that in the spring of 1942 consumption had fallen to slightly less than 3,000 tons per month, most of which comprised motor fuel and kerosineand was only about 13 per cent, of pre-war figures. It is thought that consump-tion has remained at about this level.  .Norway (5).&apos; Reliable figures are available for the first part of this year. It is believedthat motor fuel consumption is now rather lower than the average figure of about,500 tons per month for the first eight months of 1943, and the total consumptionof all products is estimated at the rate of 125,000 tons per annum, &apos;Denmark (6).Motor fuel consumption has been drastically reduced during recent months and there have been further conversions to producer gas. Gasoline consumption was recently reported at 1,000 tons per month and kerosine at 800 tons per month.Consumption of these products is estimated for the eight months at an average monthly rate of 1,500 and 800 tons respectively. The consumption of black oilshas recently been reported .at about 3,000 tons per month, of which 1,800 tons are supplied to the fisheries. The foregoing estimates are confirmed to someextent by the reported sales in July of one of the principal oil companies.Belgium (7).The estimates are based upon detailed reports which are considered reliable.Holland (8).The estimate of 74,000 tons per annum for all products is based on theconsumption figures for Denmark and Belgium. Consumption of gas/diesel oilby inland water transport is estimated at 21,000 tons per annum (compared with15,000 tons in Belgium) to allow for greater inland waterway activity.France (9).Reliable figures for the month of June show imports of gasoline and gas oilof 10,800 and 5,200 tons respectively. The gasoline is blended, the proportions of gasoline, alcohol and benzol being 58 per cent;, 29 per cent, and 13 per cent.;the monthly consumption of motor spirit at the June level is therefore estimatedat 18,600 tons.Imports of lubricants have been at the rate of 2,000 tons monthly, and afurther 2,000 tons are obtained from anthracenic oil and resins.It appears probable that imports are now on a lower scale than in June, butas they were higher in the early part of the year the June figures have beenadopted as the average rate for the eight months.The annual rate of 358,000 tons for all products is approximately doubleprevious estimates, which had been largely based on the report of a director &quot;of a french oil company whose figures for imports of oil were taken to refer to allunblended products.   It now appears that these figures covered motor spirit only.
Hungary (10).Previous estimates of the consumption of oil products in Hungary are nowbelieved to have been too low. The weight of intelligence implies thatconsumption is still at a comparatively high level. Current estimates indicatethat the annual rate is to the order of 240,000 tons, including consumption inthe territory acquired since 1939, and this compares with the 1938 figure of264,000 tons for pre-war Hungary.Italy and Albania (11).Consumption in the eight months is estimated at the rate of 500,000 tons perannum. No calculations can yet be&apos;made of non-military consumption in northern italy after the 1st September.Roumania (12).Consumption has been estimated at the same level as shown in our May 1943Report, namely, 1,875,000 tons per annum. A high demand for oil products isbeing maintained, and there have been no indications, notwithstanding areduction in production, of any f alling-off in domestic consumption or of tangiblesavings through the use of alternative fuels. Pending further information,consumption is therefore assumed to be at the same level as early this year.Yugoslavia, Greece and Bulgaria (13, 14 and 15).No detailed evidence is available upon the consumption of these countries,but it appears to be on a very low scale.Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania (16, 17 and 18).No statistics have been reported of the current consumption of these countries,and the estimates are consequently arbitrary.1Occupied Russia (19).No information is available upon the non-military consumption of occupiedRussia, and the figure of 225,000 tons is a guess.

The following factors have been allowed for: (a) Wastage and evaporation.   An addition of 1\ per cent, has been made to the consumption estimates.   (Note: This allowance was not included in previous reports.)(b) To allow for increased consumption during cold weather on the Eastern Front, an excess consumption equivalent to 20 per cent, is assumed for the period mid-November&quot;&quot; to mid-April. This allowance has been tentatively put at 50&apos;per cent, by those making the same study in Washington, and as compared with a factor of 25 per cent,that has been suggested by Canadian Army authorities; however, it is felt that 20 per cent, is a more conservative figure pending receipt of more accurate data. this factor has not been applied for the estimates January-April 1942 as the figures for these months were calculated on a slightly different basis.(c) The monthly figures are exclusive of the allowance for the estimated savings due to the use of producer gas totalling 35,000 tons in 1942 and 100,000 tons from January. to August inclusive 1943 (see Appendix IV).Naval. The estimated consumption for September 1943 excludes any consumption by Italian naval units.Air Forces. Savings in motor fuel consumption by the conversion of ground vehicles to producer gas are assumed to follow the course of the Army figures; the saving begins totake effect in January and rises by equal steps to a figure of 15 per cent, in August.   The total saving in the eight months is, however, only 36,000 tons, and no correctionto the existing figures for the period January to August 1943 is made at present.Todt Organisation. Consumption by the Todt Organisation (including Aerodrome Constructors)&apos; lias been put at the same figure as it was estimated.to be in 1941.   operations have greatly expanded since that date but it is assumed that producer gas has obviated any increases in liquid fuel consumption.   It is, however, quite possible, that this estimate for oil consumption in 1943 may be too low. &quot;,
ANNEX IV.A Preliminary Study of the Extent of The Usage of Substitute Fuelsin Enemy Europe.Germany has now had four years in which to carry out a programme for the conversion of petrol-driven vehicles to other fuels. While this programme cannotbe considered to have reached completion, it is believed that the progress ofsubstitution has reached its final stages and that such further savings in liquidfuels as may be made during the next few- months are unlikely to amount toimportant quantities.Conversions of Civilian Vehicles.Bottled Gases and Town Gas.Whereas possibilities exist for greater use being made of propane-butane, itis probable that the more extensive employment of low-pressure gases is limited by distribution difficulties. This also applies to town and sewer gases, the useof which is restricted to relatively few localities. Producer&apos; gas, therefore, remains&apos;the principal source of further economies, although, for a number of reasons, theseare not considered likely to attain important dimensions.Producer Gas.The attached Table represents a tentative approximation Of the position asat June 1943. It is based upon the assumption that, up to the end of 1942,practically all generator production, both in. Germany and in the occupied countries working, for Germany, has been destined for the conversion of non-military vehicles. Since then, such production as was not engaged on replace-ments has been increasingly diverted to supplying generators for the armed forces with a consequent slacking off, probably to quite small figures, of the productionof generators for civilian purposes. It is therefore considered that there havenot been any appreciable changes in the number of civilian vehicles converted since june 1943.: , Some confirmation that the conversion of civilian vehicles is reaching a climaxis afforded by a study of the various Decrees that have been made since.thebeginning of the war.  These Decrees are summarised below.The original Decree of 1939 was intended to bring about the conversion ofall suitable vehicles that were permitted to be in operation. It was then foundthat the limited output of generators was not being Utilised in such a way thatthe maximum savings could be effected. The Decrees of October 1940 and May1941, by narrowing the scope of conversion, rectified this and virtually meant that a scale of priorities for conversion was fixed. The regulations of September1942, issued by the Central Board of Generators, which had been set up in Mayof that year, further clarified the position, but slightly relaxed the prohibition on the conversion of private cars and delivery vans ordered in May 1941. TheDecree of September 1943 cancels all previous restrictions on conversions tosolid fuels.The gradual relaxation of the restrictions can be taken as^ an indication that,as the conversion of high-priority vehicles was completed, lower-priority vehicles were included, and that this progress has finally resulted in there now remainingonly the lowest-priority class, passenger cars without the red triangle and deliveryvans, which can be converted.Although these arid other still unconverted vehicles may still be regarded asa theoretical further source of economies by conversion, it is believed that thepossibilities in this direction are limited by four main considerations : (i) The increase in the number of generator-operated vehicles has resultedin generator manufacturing capacity being diverted to a major extentto the provision of spares and replacements. The Germans haveadmitted that a useful life of only three years can be expected from agenerator, and in view of the rapid progress of conversion over thelast two years, manufacturing capacity is now being increasingly
occupied by the demand for new generators for fitting to newly: constructed vehicles, and for replacements for existing equipments(ii) Those categories of vehicles which, by nature of their purpose ori; conditions of service were most suitable for conversion, have how been; converted. Any vehicles now remaining to be converted will be those for which there was some good reason for objection to conversionin the early stages of the programme.(iii) The physical difficulties of constructing, fuelling and maintainingproducer. units are increasing. The problems of providing fuel* . supplies are probably greater than those connected with labour and materials. Facilities for providing wood and charcoal now appear tobe fully extended; it is aimed to increase the use of special coal and., coke fuels, although these, too, add their share to the burden upontransport.(iv) The number of commercial vehicles now believed to be operating in enemyEurope is already insufficient to maintain efficient distribution. Anyfurther impairment of the efficiency of these vehicles, such as wrouldnecessarily be involved in conversion, would only aggravate the prob-lem and may therefore be considered impractical.Conclusions regarding the Conversion of Civilian Vehicles.1. In Germany all vehicles except those with the lowest conversion priorityand those barred by safety, or other considerations and by the inherent disadvan-tages of producer gas, have by now been converted.2. Supply and distribution facilities of the various gases used as substitute&apos;fuels are, temporarily at any rate, fully extended in meeting the demands of thosevehicles already converted to use these fuels.3: Consequently further civil conversions in Germany on any appreciablescale are unlikely, and the position is approaching stabilisation.4. In the occupied countries of Western Europe, in which on an averagetwo-thirds of all motor transport is already converted, the position, similarly, is nearly stabilised with saturation point not far away. In Eastern Europe,,especially in Hungary and Roumania, there is scope for extensive conversions; inpresent circumstances, however, it is improbable that producer gas will beadopted in these countries to any important extent.Conversion of Military Vehicles to Producer Gas.Evidence from occupied countries, of which an increasing volume has beenreceived during the past six months, justifies&apos;the conclusions (i) that a largeproportion of the motor transport of the German Army in some of the occupied territories is now producerrgas driven; (ii) that conversions of German Armyvehicles iri; those areas to producer-gas are still continuing. It is known that,producer-gas vehicles are used by the army in Germany itself, but to what extent:is still rather doubtful. Evidence of the use of producer-gas vehicles in Russia,although probably at some distance from the front-line, has also been received. .. o . In view of the fragmentary nature of the evidence no reliable estimate of thetotal number of producer-gas vehicles in the German Army can be formed.A figure can only be arrived at on the basis of assumptions, largely of a theoreticalcharacter.   These are as follows : A. It is assumed that, owing, to the practical disadvantages of this form ofpropulsion, producer-gas will not be employed in Divisions belonging&apos;      to the Field Army, which may be required to take part in mobilewarfare on any front at any time..   &apos;   . . ;B. For similar reasons, it will hot be employed to any great extent in&apos;  non-divisional units attached to and forming part of the Field Army.* Some confirmation of the number of producer units required for the replacement ofexisting units is to be found in the following statistics.   During the past twelve months tlv-output of producer units is estimated to have been absorbed approximately as follows:  For the conversion of Wehrmacht vehicles      ...       ...       ...       .:.      80,000Fitted to new vehicles...................       ...       24,000Replacements of civilian and military wastage ,..      ...       ...      ...      66,000     AThe total number of producer units now in use&apos; in German Europe to absorb these replacementsIs now approximately 440,000. *     r   .... v*  ;-i[26407]  &apos; d 2
&apos; C. Producer-gas can, however, be used by training divisions, coast defencedivisions and other types of divisions to which a static role is allotted.D. It can also be used by non-divisional vehicles apart from those whichoperate with the Field Army. This will include most of thenon-divisional vehicles in use in Germany and the occupied territories of Western Europe.Conclusions regarding Conversion of Military Vehicles.1. The total number of motor vehicles, other than motor-cycles, comprised in categories C and D is estimated at about 70,000, of which 60,000 (orapproximately 85 per cent.) are likely to have been converted, or to be in processOf being converted, with a further 10,000 which may be converted later.2. The total number of vehicles in category B is considered to be nearly150,000, of which it is improbable that more than 15,000 have been converted.:  The likelihood of further conversions of vehicles in this category will be governed by the degree of stringency which prevails in the liquid fuel position. -as u. a whole.3. It is therefore assumed that the total number of producer-gas vehicles in use by the German Army in September 1943 was about 75,000.Conversion of German Air Force Vehicles to Producer Gas.There is evidence that some vehicles of G.A.F. ground units are being converted to producer gas, but there is very little information as to the extentof such conversion. It is assumed, however, that conversion is proceeding at separately comparable with that of the German army.Summary of the more Important Decrees concerning Conversion to substitute Fuels.IQth September, .1939.All vehicles permitted to circulate after the 20th September, 1939, which willb^e marked with a red triangle, are to be converted after due notice from the registration Authorities.-28th December, 1939.Vehicles used for transporting explosives and inflammable liquids must not be converted.13th June, 1940.Diesel engines not suitable for conversion to producer gas may be converted to liquid gas provided they are garaged not more than 10 kms. from a liquidgas storage tank.20th June, 1940.Subsidies announced for conversion of petrol vehicles, semi-converted andwholly converted Diesel vehicles.25th October, 1940.The following vehicles are exempted from conversion : 1.

Notes on the foregoing Table.1. In general, all figures for the occupied countries in West and North-West Europe come from reliable sources, particularly those for Belgium, norway and Denmark, though in these, as in the others, there may be inaccuracies dueto the time lag in the reception of reports.2. Figures of the total numbers of vehicles in operation which, on the whole,are open to more doubt than the total numbers operating on substitute fuels,are based on (a) the pre-war totals, (b) the availability of liquid fuel, (c) the progressin the use of substitute fuels, (d)&apos;ihe industrial activity of the country and (e) the effectiveness of requisitioning. They must therefore be regarded as approximately-tions based mainly on a study of intelligence. The total figures for Belgium,Norway and Holland are taken directly from good intelligence reports, whilethe total for Germany is to some extent confirmed by a fairly reliable source.3. The number of vehicles operating on substitute fuels other than producergas in Germany is based on what is believed to be a good report that 100,000vehicles are operating on Treibgas, 12,000 on high pressure gas and 2,000 onlow pressure gas. A slight adjustment has been made to bring these figuresup to date.4. The number of producer-gas vehicles in Germany is based on threepublished figures. In October 1941 General von Schell stated that there were150,000 producer-gas fuelled vehicles in occupied Europe. A year later a target figure of 250,000 such vehicles was announced and soon afterwards Hitleris reported to have demanded 100,000 additional conversions within a year. Inaddition, the calculation takes note of, and tallies with, estimated generatorproduction based upon intelligence and upon two known figures of producer-gasvehicles in use in Germany at two known dates.5. The Todt organisation relies to a large extent upon locally requisitionedcivilian vehicles, which vehicles are included in the totals shown in the abovetable. Extensive use is also made of military vehicles drawn from the MilitaryReserve Motor Parks. It is consequently assumed that the use of producer-gasin the Todt organisation is broadly covered by the foregoing statistics for civil and military vehicles.ANNEX V.The Crude Oil Refining Capacity of Axis Europe.The oil refineries in Europe may be divided into the following groups : Group 1.

Roumania.An air reconnaissance carried out towards the end of October shows thatthe three refineries that were most seriously damaged by the attack on the1st August were still out of action. Repairs to the other three refineries that were less badly damaged are well advanced and these plants may now be working at about 80 per cent, of their&apos;normal output. Upon this assumption therewould theoretically be a surplus of refining capacity in Roumania at the presenttime of about 444,000 tons. However, judging by the urgency of the repairsthat are being undertaken, this surplus is more apparent than real and it isprobable that present capacity is insufficient for requirements.Group 2. The Central Europe Group.This group comprises the refineries in Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and poland. Theoretically they form a self-contained block and the capacity in poland and Czechoslovakia should be almost capable of absorbing the unrefmablesurpluses from Austria and Hungary. The above table shows an unrefined surplusof 132,000 tons to be exported elsewhere.There is no evidence of serious damage to the Hamburg refineries whichrepresent 1,130,000 tons of the surplus capacity of 1,600,000 tons in Germany.    &apos;The refineries at Hanover comprise the bulk of Germany&apos;s refining capacityother than at Hamburg or on the North Sea coast, and these are fully engaged in handling the production.of the oil fields in that part of Germany.Group 4:.-The Low Countries.This group contains 1,200,000 tons of unused refining capacity. More than half of this capacity is represented by the Sheli Refinery at Rotterdam. As it isbelieved that this refinery is in a damaged condition, actual capacity at the presenttime may be less than this figure.Group 5. France.- &apos; Capacity in France has been reduced from a pre-war level of nearly 8 million tons to about 3 million tons by the destruction or dismantling of five of the mostimportant refineries in the country. As a result, the remaining capacity islocated either on the Atlantic coast or near Marseilles.Group 6. Italy.The Italian refinery capacity at present available to the Axis amounts to approximately 1^ million tons.,Whereas there is a surplus of crude oil refining capacity, the spare capacity is very inconveniently situated if circumstances should make it necessary for idleplants to be brought into use. Furthermore, many of the plants are not designed for; the handling and processing of certain types of crude..  .. -:t\ &apos;:mss1 Any reduction of the refining capacity of Roumania or of the Central Europe.g&apos;rqiip would entail the, transport of crude oil to Italy, Northern Europe, or to therefineries situated on the French coast. ,   /;. VjGroup 3. Germany.Summary.
Approximately 75 per cent, of Roumanian crude is a waxy, viscous oil whichbecomes solid at temperatures below 68DF. The transport of this crude, either by barge or by rail-tank-car, during the winter months incurs numerousdifficulties. Furthermore, if the Axis should be confronted with the problem ofexporting from Roumania some 250,000 tons of crude per month or, say, some 17oil trains per day, during the period that the Danube is frozen, a considerabletask is involved.A large proportion of the oil products processed in south-eastern Europe areconsumed in that area and upon the Russian front. Consequently any importantdislocation of the refineries now operating to capacity in Roumania, or of thosein Central Europe, would necessitate a major reorganisation of oil distribution in enemy Europe. The transport problems involved would not only be very great buta severe check in the continuity of supplies would inevitably occur.ANNEX VI.The Effect of Italy&apos;s Withdrawal from the Axis on the German oil position.The consumption of oil by the Italians during the first eight months of 1943is estimated as follows :  A pprox. rate in metric tons per annum.Civilian ......      ......      ... 500,000Army    ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 200,000Navy......      ...      ...      ... 7    ... 575,000Air Force       ...       ... ...       ... 200,000Total ...      .:.     &apos;...      ... 1,475,000These requirements were met- from the following sources :  Tons.

As, however, there will be some increase in theGermans&apos; own oil requirements resulting directly from the Italian withdrawal,the net saving of oil to Germany is estimated at about 1 million tons per annum!It is not. known whether Germany is now taking all the Roumanian andHungarian oil formerly acquired by. Italy, but, pending further information, itis assumed that this is happening.ANNEX VII.Estimated German Oil Position if Supplies of Roumanian and HungarianOil are lost to Germany.Upon the hypothetical assumption that Germany was denied the oil suppliesof Roumania and Hungary, there would result a net reduction of the oil availableto Germany equivalent to about 2,125,000 tons per annum, or a reduction in[26407] e
current consumption of 177,000 tons per month. The calculation upon which thesefigures are based is given in the table below.This reduction would be equivalent to almost half of Germany&apos;s present armyconsumption.The denial of this oil would also have a serious effect upon the distributionof petroleum to the German dispositions in South-Eastern and Eastern Europe,the gravity of the situation being dependent upon the suddenness with which it came about.The deficiency caused on the overall supply position would seriously handicap&quot;Germany&apos;s powers of resistanceAnnual rate in thousands of metric tons.Total Axis Production (Appendix A)    ...       ...       ... -&apos;   ...Less (crude oil in terms of finished products) 1.
