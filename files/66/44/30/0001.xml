THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 580.21st December, 1943.WAR CABINET.BROADCASTING.Memorandum by the Deputy Prime Minister.THE Charter of the B.B.C. will come up for renewal in 1946. I understandthat the Minister of Information has submitted a paper to the reconstruction committee on the domestic aspects of the questions which will be involved.2. But there are also international aspects of the matter which should inmy view be given early consideration. If, as I hope, the policy of preserving theB.B.C. free from commercial exploitation is continued, the question of foreignstations which are exploited by commercial interests requires examination.Before the War, stations such as Radio Normandy and Radio Luxemburgput forward sponsored programmes in competition with the B.B.C. There is thepossibility of stations adjoining this country being controlled in the interests ofUnited States business to the detriment of British trade and industry. I considerthat there should be attention paid to international policy on this subject before -continental Governments are reinstated.3. A wider question is that of the control of wireless on the Continent ofEurope. Doubtless in the period of resettlement immediately after the war radiowill be controlled in the interests of the United Nations, but a policy is requiredfor the post-war period which will utilise this medium in the interests of peace and as far as possible prevent it being used to promote war. The LucerneConvention involving the allocation of wavelengths will obviously need to bere considered.4. This seems to me to involve two questions. The first is what arrange-ments should be made for control of the wireless in ex-enemy countries as ameasure ancillary to the denial to them of the instruments of war. The second is what can and should be done to make use of the wireless as a positive instrument for peace.It was, in my view, a grave mistake in the between war periods that the Leagueof Nations did not develop an international wireless service devoted to spreading the principles of international co-operation. This omission should be corrected.Such a service should not be purely didactic and educational, but should be designed to give programmes of the highest quality drawn from many nationalsources. It should also as a prime duty give news as far as possible true andunbiased by national interests. I should like an expert inquiry to be undertakenas to the practical means of carrying out this suggestion with a view to the matterbeing discussed with our Allies. It seems to me that just as control of the wirelesshas been one of the most potent instruments in the hands of the dictators and secret listening one of. the hopes of the oppressed, so after the war the wirelessshould be used to the utmost as a servant of freedom.C.

secret.P. (45)  58122nd December, 1945WAR cabinet copy NO.FINANCE OF RELIEFM era or a n dura &quot;b y th e G ha nc el I o r of the exchequer it may &quot;be helpful to ray colleagues if I state thefollowing views supplementing the memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs  (tf.P.(43) 579).The financial plan recommended for acceptance by theU.N.R.R.A.  Council meeting seems to me generally satisfactory.I understand that the contribution which Congress will beasked to approve is likely to reach $1,500 m., representing a rounding up of a figure something under $1,400 m., equivalentto l&apos;--b of the national, income for the year ended 30th June,1943.      I suggest that our procedure should be on similar lines and that we should set our figure at  80,000,000.In the last budget  Jhite Paper our net national income was put at  7,384 millions for the calendar year 1942.      For theyear ended 30th June,  1943 the figure is estimated at approximately  7,800,1^01) and I suggest that it would &quot;be proper for us to round up our contribution of 1% on this basis to  80,000,000.The expenditure will be mainly incurred by the supply departments, who will procure supplies to meet U,N.R.R.A!s requirements in the same manner as they procure supplies for the United Kingdom.      The cost of relief supplies should,like that of the supplies for the United Kingdom, most conveniently be charged against the Vote of Credit, and Ithink that there is ample justification for regarding our contribution for relief as a proper charge against the vote of Credit.      Even our contribution to administrative expensesof U.N.R.R.A.  should,  I think, be so charged, especially si neeit is to form part of our 1% of national income contribution and not an addition thereto.      It vail be necessary to seekParliamentary authority for an extension of the ambit of the vote of Credit to cover this charge, and I propose that thenecessary authority should be sought when the next Vote of credit has to be presented, that is some time prob&apos;a&quot;bly inFebruary.      It would of course be most improbable that eventhe larger part of the  80 million would be spent.....during the life of the next Vote of Credit and the balance would have tocome out of further Votes for which Parliament would have tobe asked.The financial plan recommends that not less than 10$of each country&apos;s contribution should be available forpurchasing the goods and services of other countries.      Thismeans that any purchases for relief supplies which we make,for instance,  in Australia woudd be chargeable against ourU/o.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY \ S GOVERNMENT)
