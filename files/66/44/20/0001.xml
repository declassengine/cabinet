THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT1141Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1943.SECRET.Copy No. 34W.P. (43) 570.j       16th December, 1943.WAR CABINET.SUPPLIES OF PHOSPHATE ROCK FOR AUSTRALIA, NEW zealand and SOUTH AFRICA.1. The Shipping Committee submit, for the decision of the War Cabinet,an urgent question with regard to supplies of phosphate rock to Australia, New-Zealand and the Union of South Africa.2. For some considerable time, the Governments of these three Dominionshave represented that largely increased supplies of phosphatic fertilisers are essential if production is to be maintained at present levels let alone increased,as is vitally necessary for war purposes. The land in all three Dominions is naturally deficient in phosphates.3. The present position as regards shipments of phosphate rock to the threeDominions is as follows :  In 1943, the total available output of some 450,000 tons of phosphate rockfrom the Red Sea and Makatea (which have recently been the normal sources ofsupply) was shipped to the Dominions; this amount was less than had been estimated, and, to meet the shortfall, arrangements are being made to ship about60,000 tons of phosphate rock to Australia and New Zealand, from Florida and50,000 tons to South Africa from Morocco. The greater part of this will be shipped in December/January. A small improvement in Red Sea and Makateaoutput is expected in 1944, and shipments to Australia and New Zealand fromthese sources are estimated at about 100,000 tons during the first quarter of 1944and to South Africa at about 20,000 tons during the same period.4. The further requirements of the Dominions have been submitted, after examination in London, to the Combined Food Board in Washington. the combined Food Board have approved the following allocations of phosphate rockfor shipment by the end of March 1944, in addition to the existing ^programme-re f erred to in paragraph 3 :-South Africa...................        37,000Of this total of 318,000 tons, supplies amounting to 125,000 tons would beavailable from Florida and the balance would be available in Morocco.5. In the view of the Shipping Committee, it is clearly desirable that, if at all practicable, substantial additional amounts of phosphate xock should be shipped to Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The essential nature ofthese requirements has been recognised by the competent Combined Authoritiesin Washington. - .Memorandum by the Chairman of the Shipping Committee.australia new ZealandTons.185,00096,000[26588]
So far as Australia and New Zealand are concerned, the committee considered, on the information put before them, that, in the absence of substantialimports of phosphates, it was difficult to see how a drastic decrease in production could be avoided at the very time when demands for food might be at their peak.The production targets for 1943-44 in Australia and New Zealand for such products as meat, milk, fruit, rice and vegetables in no case fall far short of,and in some cases considerably exceed, actual production immediately before thewar. Under existing arrangements, however, the phosphate available for distribution in Australia and New Zealand is only some 40-50 per cent, of thepre-war allocation; and the fact that phosphate application has been much below the pre-war level for three years has had a cumulative effect on yieldswhich will grow more serious with each succeeding crop. The effect of phosphateshortage is in particular being felt in dairy pastures, since hitherto annual cropshave been fertilised at the expense of pasture top dressing.The high production targets which have been set in Australia and NewZealand are designed to cover, not only essential supplies for this country, butalso the greatly increased Service demands which are to be anticipated in the pacific, particularly from the United States forces, and also relief requirements.There is also a short-term aspect. If the Dominion authorities see no prospectof substantial amounts of fertilisers, they will naturally be inclined to reduce their exports of certain commodities in 1944 to take account of the shortage which maybe expected in 1945. On the other hand, if shipments of phosphates are guaran-teed, even though they are not actually completed by the end of March 1944, theDominions authorities would no doubt be prepared to run clown their stocksof fertilisers to the lowest limit to ensure that maximum quantities are madeavailable for immediate application.The case for increased allocation of phosphate to South Africa rests on a,somewhat different basis from that in respect of Australia and New Zealand. the primary object is to enable local products to be increased sufficiently to meetlocal demands which have increased through war-time conditions and, if possible,to make available a surplus for export to neighbouring territories. The shipment of the proposed amount to South Africa in full is not perhaps so urgent as theproposals in respect of Australia and New Zealand, but an increased allocationwould to some extent constitute an insurance against crop failure and a conse-quent necessity to import food. Experience has shown that food shortages areliable to arise in the South, and East African territories at short notice; andalthough enquiries made by the Shipping Committee have shown the difficultyof controlling the crop in the Union and building up a surplus for export, thereis now some prospect that if climatic conditions are favourable the Union mightbe able to provide supplies of maize or other foodstuffs for African territoriesnext year.6. As regards the question of supplying shipping to meet these require-ments, the three Dominions could hardly be expected to agree to any proposal that phosphate rock should be carried in the ships at present allocated to them from North America, since they already consider that these ships are inadequate for their other essential needs. If the total amount suggested were carried in ships diverted from the United Kingdom import programme, the cost to that programme, taking into account the length of the haul, would amount to at leasthalf a million tons during the first half of 1944.If the full amount of 318,000 tons were lifted from Florida and North africa in January, February and March, the following average number of ships wouldbe required :  Australia INew Zealand.    South Africa.Total average per month    ...       ... 12 1/2Total number of ships required for loading over 3 months ...       ... 30 57. It is understood that at the recent Conferences in the Middle East, theAmerican authorities took the view that, in the light of the world tonnageposition, the shipping allocation to the Dominions during the first half of 1944ought not to be increased above what it was in the first half of 1943, but theShipping Committee feel that there are special circumstances in the present instance which would warrant the matter being taken up with the Americans,and they recommend that, as proposed in a cable from the Australian PrimeMinister, a request should be made to the American authorities to provide ships to lift the supplies of phosphate rock allocated to Australia and&apos; New Zealand.
8. Provisional estimates of food consumption by the United States forcesin Australia and New Zealand during 1944 are as follows : .NewAustralia.    Zealand.      Total.Meat (carcase equivalent)   ... (tons) 167,000 158,000 325,000Butter          .........(tons) .   12,000 10,000 22,000Cheese          .........(tons) 500         2,500 3,000Full Cream Condensed Milk   (tons) 24,000         5,000 29,000Full Cream Milk Powder   ... (tons) 1,500           ... 1,500Fresh Milk    ...       ...       ... (gals.) 5-5 mil. 2mil. 7-5 mil.Dried Eggs    .........(tons) 5,000          ... 5,000Lard............(tons) 2.000          ... 2,000Skim Milk Powder......(tons) ...               500 500No estimates are available for cereals and sugar, but it seems reasonable to assume that the American authorities are hoping to obtain a major part of their require-ments for these commodities on the spot.It is suggested that the matter should be put to the Americans on the basis that a failure to import into Australia and New Zealand fertilisers of the amountsuggested would be reflected in a diminution of food supplies there, which couldnot fail to be reflected in turn in the supplies of food for the use of United states forces in the Pacific as well as for relief purposes and for consumption in theIndian Ocean area and this country.9. This argument would not have the same weight with the american authorities in relation to the carriage of the increased allocation of phosphaterock to the Union of South Africa, and the Shipping Committee assume that,if the additional requirements for that area are approved, it will be necessaryfor this allocation to be carried in British tonnage.10. The present requirements, approved by the Combined Food Board,relate only to the period ending the 31st March, 1944. It has to be borne inmind, however, that the acceptance of the principle of the need to supportmaximum food production in the three Dominions implies a continuing demandfor phosphate rock at a much higher level than has prevailed over the last twelve months. Latest information suggests that the requirements of the threeDominions will continue to be put at well over double the rate of shipments in1943.11. Telegrams addressed to the Prime Minister by the Prime Minister ofAustralia and the Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand are set out in the annex to this Memorandum.12. To summarise, a decision is asked from the War Cabinet on thefollowing questions: (a) Should arrangements be made to use British tonnage to ship phosphatereck to the Union of South Africa to the extent of 37,000 tons, orany lesser quantity, by the end of March, 1944?(&amp;) Should the American - authorities be asked to provide vessels to shipphosphate rock to a total of 281,000 tons to Australia and NewZealand 1(c) If American assistance is not forthcoming, what proportion, if any,of the total amount of 281,000 tons allocated to Australia and NewZealand by the Combined Food Board should be shipped in Britishtonnage %(d) If it is decided to approach the American authorities, should any immediate arrangements be made by the Ministry of War transport for the shipment of phosphate rock to Australia and New Zealandpending the outcome of these negotiations %Signed on behalf of the Committee,HARCOURT JOHNSTONE,Chairman.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,16 A December, 1943.
ANNEX.Telegram, dated 10th December, from Prime Minister of Australia.The quantity of phosphate rock recently agreed upon as being Australia^minimum requirements cannot be subtracted from without repercussion.Australian agriculture&quot; is showing in a marked fashion the consequences ofdiminished superphosphate supplies. As you know, our requirements are some-where in the vicinity of 1,000,000 tons per annum and this year we have had for distribution 480,000 tons only.Recently the position developed in such a manner as to make it imperativeto release another 40,000 tons to meet certain phases of our production programme.The release of this 40,000 tons reduces our reserves to the bare minimum of safety.I am particularly apprehensive of the effect that curtailed phosphate supplies is having on production and unless more superphosphate can be allotted to ourfarmers the best we can hope for is a stationary rural programme in our super-phosphate consuming industries. Should this position arise, it will make itexceedingly difficult for us to discharge our overseas food commitments. this applies particularly to pastures which in time of normal superphosphate supplywere top-dressed. To-day top-dressings are totally inadequate and carryingcapacities and yields are consequently reduced. This phase is daily becoming more evident.Not only do we require the additional quantities of superphosphate recentlyagreed to, but we require the phosphate rock quickly. I understand the difficulty is, not so much one of supplies as of shipping.In view of the urgent nature of the matter, might I suggest that the americans should be pressed by United Kingdom to provide ships to lift theFlorida supplies if this should prove to be the best means of satisfying, as faras is possible, our phosphate requirements.The question of adequate phosphate rock has been very closely examined by my officers over recent months and their unanimous conclusion is that, unlessmore superphosphate is made available, we cannot adequately discharge our foodproduction programme and meet our food commitments.In view of the circumstances, I would be pleased if you could use every endeavour to ensure that adequate immediate supplies are made available toAustralia.Telegram, dated 15th December, from Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand.We have given much thought to expansion of production of foodstuffsurgently needed by United Kingdom and it is evident that in order to ensureour maximum contribution to food requirements, particularly for United Kingdomrequirements and United States Forces, it is essential that supplies of fertilisershould reach us in large volume at an early date. Arrangements for supply upto our normal requirements have been approved in London but it is most necessarythat shipping should be available in sufficient tonnage to bring fertiliser here withall speed.Would, appreciate your personal consideration.
