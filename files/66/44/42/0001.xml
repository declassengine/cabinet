THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAlfNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 592.SOth December, 1943.Copy No.    3 4WAR ^CABINET.TURKEY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I should like to draw my colleagues&apos; attention to the annexed report fromHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Angora on the internal situation in Turkey.A. E.Foreign Office, ZOth December, 1943.ANNEX.Sir H. Knatchbull-Hugessen to Mr. Eden.(No. 505.   Secret.)Sir, Angora, 1st December, 1043.THE recent conversations in Cairo between yourself and the turkish minister for Foreign Affairs have again thrown the political spotlight on Turkey,and the possibility that for one reason or? another Turkey may in the coming months take the final steps along the road to belligerency seems to render timely a brief study in relation to that contingency of the internal position of the countryand an assessment of the stability of the present regime.2. There can be no doubt that, judged by western standards and leaving aside the question of the adequacy or otherwise of weapons of war in the narrowsense of the term and in particular of defences against air attack, Turkey is in no--state-to-engag-eiiiL-modern-war-, N^^ffdr-t-has-heen-made-to-organise-her- maitpower; her industrial resources, though developing, are limited and inefficient; herfuel supply is barely adequate for peace-time needs and could only be materiallyincreased over a period of years by a well-conceived and expensive long-term policy, the execution of which would be dependent on the importation of thenecessary material from abroad; and her railway transport system, thoughreasonably efficient by local standards, is incapable of bearing any considerableadditional load. It is, moreover, only too clear that (always assuming an adequatefuel supply) even the present carrying capacity could be maintained only if the single-track system were not subjected to interruption, e.g., by bombing.   One[ special train nowadays causes quite an upset, and slight damage some months agoto a small railway culvert 20 miles west of Angora completely disorganised therailway services for two days. All-weather roads are still far too few, and thesea transport services, though not bad in their way, could not provide much relief.3. Nor is the picture much brighter from other points of view. Theadministrative machine functions with appalling slowness--the result partly of excessive centralisation. Examples of this were the necessity for a decision ofthe Council of Ministers before my wife could send six used tennis balls to british prisoners of war, and for the personal signature of the Marshal on a permit for a turkish plane to take the military attache urgently to Smyrna, in spite of the factthat General Arnold&apos;s journey was being undertaken with the full approval of12236   [26649]
the M? ustries concerned. No official will assume responsibility, and the somewhatindifferent basic human material of Turkish officialdom is offered no real chanceof developing itself. Moreover, it is so lamentably underpaid that no official, highor low, can hope to live on his emoluments. The solution has been the obviousone. Corruption, which had been almost stamped out in the early years of therepublic, is rife and, aided by constantly rising prices, has spread into everybranch of the Administration and of the public service. So bad, indeed, hadthings become that, as you will remember, the President issued a severe warningabout it in his speech of the 1st November. But the warning, like others about the bad economic state of the country, has gone unheeded and there is no sign of theGovernment taking effective action in these or in the other fields of internalpolitics which so glaringly require attention.4. In a modern western State public opinion would certainly be critical of such a state of affairs. In Turkey there has so far been little open criticism.The peasant population, which represents such a large proportion of the whole,is unusually prosperous and is not heavily taxed. The young men are with thecolours, but that is nothing new for Turks, and they are neither being over-worked nor killed. In the towns there is also prosperity, but it is there that thehigh prices are being most felt and where criticism of the Administration isheard. Actually, the wave of corruption is more or less taken for granted, as isalso Government inefficiency, but there is increasing anxiety about the country&apos;economic future. This finds expression more particularly among the youngthinking Turks, though it is also felt by the Deputies, many of whom this summer, on the instructions of the President himself, have for the first timeseen the Turkish peasants in their constituencies at close quarters. They areastonished at what they found one of the most modern of the leading Deputies(a boon companion of Ataturk) has confessed to Mr. Helm that Turkey is stillan oriental country and a second that, while an infinitesimal proportion of theTurkish population belongs to the 20th century and a rather larger one to the19th, the vast majority belongs to the 10th century. This is, indeed, strangelanguage to hear in Angora, but it shows that the task ahead is appreciated betterperhaps than it ever was before. This appreciation begets the enquiry whetherthe present Government is properly facing the task. Quite a number of deputies, as well as business men, are not satisfied that it is, and of late therehas been talk of dissatisfaction. And, somewhat surprisingly though not without&apos;some logic, this dissatisfaction is linked with no little Turkish criticism of theapplication of the Tax on Wealth. The latter is now widely recognised to &quot;havebeen . a grave mistake, and many in responsible quarters are believed to beinsistent on closing the book and cutting the loss. Though the idea of the taxis said to have been the Presidents, it is rumoured that opposition to the liquidation-tion of the whole business now comes in the main from the Prime Minister.5. Whether or not this is correct, I have the impression that M. SaracoghTsposition is not so strong as it was and there is talk of Cabinet changes. Thereis not, I think, any widespread demand for the resignation of-M. Saracoglu.Jiather-do I believe that the critics would be satisfied with a Cabinet reshuffleand a promise from M. Saracoglu of more effective action. I say this mainly because the present Prime Minister is so closely identified with the foreign policywhich Turkey has followed since the outbreak of war. This policy hasthroughout had the wholehearted support of the Turkish people and it would perhaps be a mistake not to see a danger signal in the fact that the first realcriticism of the Governments foreign policy was heard on the 16th Novemberwhen the Minister for Foreign Affairs reported to the party on his talks with you in Cairo and sought approval for the Turkish Governments reply ofthe 17th November. It is not without interest that on that occasionM. Menemencioglu faced the party alone, though throughout the debate he hadthe most effective assistance outside the Chamber itself of the President of theRepublic. The Prime Minister played no part perhaps because the Presidentfelt that M. Saracoglu was less able to take the criticism than the Minister forForeign Affairs.6. There is no doubt that in their reply of the 17th November the TurkishGovernment were in advance of public opinion by this I mean the relatively small body of Deputies and others who, in spite of&quot; the power of the President,the Marshal, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, haveinfluence with the masses and must be reckoned with in this particular questionof foreign policy.   Although the press has been given a lead by the Government
in the direction of Turkish belligerency, this lead has only been partly followed and the country has certainly not yet been prepared for belligerency at an earlydate. Given a little time, and especially if helped by outside events, the educativecampaign may well bear fruit. But if in present circumstances and before theground is much further prepared the Saracoglu Government were suddenly toenter the war, it would have difficulty in surviving the resulting storm. It ismore than doubtful whether an alternative Government would be any better from our point of view, or indeed whether any Government could lead Turkey into war willingly at the present moment. Apart from lack of incentive and the obvious unpreparedness of Turkey, public as well as Government opinion stilllooks to Germany as a protective influence against Russia in the post-war period.I do not for a moment suggest or believe that any Turkish Government could be formed which would bid for German as opposed to British friendship at present,But there would be a preference for a Government practising isolation ratherthan for one which felt obliged, owing to pressure, to commit itself to war onthe side of the Allies. In fact, my view is that if for any reason, other thandefence against external attack, Turkey were to enter the war to-day or withinthe next few weeks, the Government taking this course would be dangerouslyunpopular. Such a state of affairs would incidentally provide Axis agents witha welcome opportunity.7. But it is not merely the position of the Government, but of the Presidenthimself which would be affected. The personality of the President is of fundamental importance to the entire regime. With the passing years sinceAtaturk&apos;s death Ismet Inonu has gained in political stature and barring some major catastrophe his position seems to be quite secure. It is becoming increasingly known that while the more spectacular forms of the Kemalistrevolution, e.g., writing, headgear, &amp;c, owe their origin to Ataturk, the more solidforms, such as the relatively ambitious railway programme and the economicreforms, owe their inspiration to Ismet Pasa. It used to be thought that Atatiirkalone had the ideas and that Ismet merely applied them. This seems to havebeen erroneous. Moreover, when the tongues of the well-informed are loosednowadays, they are prepared to say that in his last years Ataturk was intolerable,and that it was the working of a benign Providence which made him throw outIsmet, with the result that the latter came to represent the reaction which was required by the Turkish people at Atatiirk&apos;s death. Again the same tonguesnow insist that it was Ismet Pasa and not Ataturk who was the main advocate of closer relations with Great Britain. If this is correct, and my authority is very high, then it seems evident that if Turkey enters the war on our side in such away as to arouse the hostility of anything like so large a body of Turkish opinon as is to-day opposed to war, this hostility will be vented not merely on the present administration, but on the President himself.8. In such circumstances a very important factor would be the army, andthe prestige of the Marshal with the army. If the Marshal supported thePresident in entering the war, the President could probably oyerridejoppositionin the party and in the press, though even then this opposition, combined withdissatisfaction with the Administration in other fields, would result in half-heartedness in Turkey&apos;s co-operation as an ally.9. If, however, the reluctant entry of Turkey into the war were followedby some initial disaster, the effect on the country would indeed be far-reaching,and the position of the President, and, therefore, of the whole regime, would-be in danger.  -I have, &amp;c.ED.
