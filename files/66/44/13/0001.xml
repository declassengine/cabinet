W. 1,20th December, 1943.Appointment, Terms of Reference and Constitution of the Committee.At their meeting on the 12th July, 1943, the War Cabinet appointed a ministerial Committee on Palestine, consisting of The Home Secretary (Chairman).The Lord Privy Seal (Lord Cranborne).The Secretary of State for India.The Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Secretary of State for Air.The Minister of State.The Deputy Minister of State Resident in the Middle East was subsequently-added to the Committee.2.   The terms of reference of the Committee were as follows : The Committee;s task is to consider and report to the War Cabinet onthe long-term policy for Palestine. The Committee should start by examining the Peel Commission^ Report, and considering whether that scheme, or somevariant of it, can now be adopted.Among other matters, the Committee will take into consideration (a) The possibilities of development in the Negeb.(b) The suggestion that satellite Jewish Settlements should be estab-lished in other areas, e.g., Cyrenaica, Tripolitania&quot; or Eritrea.Summary of the Recommendations of the Committee.3. The following is a summary of the conclusions at which the Committeehas arrived on the terms of reference quoted above : (1) That a policy based on partition offers the best arid possibly the onlyfinal solution of the Palestine problem.[26525] - b
(2) That a scheme of partition, based upon that recommended by . thePeel Commission but varying from it in certain respects, is practicable and should be adopted. This variant is illustrated in the mapappended to the Report.(3) That this variant meets, to the utmost practicable extent, the conflictingclaims of both Arabs and Jews.(4) That the possibilities of development in the Negeb should be investigated by independent experts, and that, pending the results of suchinvestigation, the area should be retained under the control of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.(5) That, should the report of the experts show that the Negeb is capable ofdevelopment, it should be leased to a Chartered Company subject to appropriate conditions.(6) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should make every effort to encourage arearrangement of the Levant and to secure the establishment of an association of Levant States consisting of a Jewish State, a JerusalemTerritory, the Lebanon and a Greater Syria, the last mentionedcomprising Syria, Trans Jordan, a small portion of the present Lebanonand the Arab residue of Palestine.(7) That care should be taken that no pronouncement, public or private, ismade on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government which may subsequentlyconflict with the attainment of this object, and that Britain&apos;s policyin the Levant should be specifically framed and pursued with thisend in view.(8) That the integrity of the Levant States should be guaranteed, if possible,by Anglo-French or Anglo-French-American treaties which wouldprovide, inter alia, for the safeguarding of British and Frenchstrategic interests.(9) That an International Body consisting of British, French and possiblyAmerican representatives should, if possible, be established toarbitrate on matters referred to it by the Levant States and to. supervise the observance of their treaty obligations, including theprotection of minority rights.(10) That, if such an association of States is established, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should stimulate policies calculated to promote -itswelfare and economic development.(1.1) That investigations into the possibility -of settling Jews elsewhere thanin Palestine should be pursued, but that this issue should not beconnected with the solution of the Palestine problem.(12) That all details of the scheme outlined in the Report should be worked out as soon as possible, and that the consultations which have been promised should be initiated and effect given to the scheme as soon asa suitable moment occurs, the suitability of the moment to be decided in the light of events.In the subsequent paragraphs of this Report we deal in more detail with theproposals summarised above.Long-Term Policy.4. On the general question of long-term policy, His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave, for the past twenty-five years, attempted to devise some constitution forPalestine in which Arabs and Jews could be persuaded to co-operate in theinterests of the country as a whole: The Balfour Declaration, of 1917 was clearlybased on the assumption that such co-operation could be secured, and the sameassumption is implicit in those clauses of the Palestine Order in Council of 1922which define the functions and constitution of the Legislative Council thenproposed, in the amended proposals for the creation of a Legislative council which were put forward in 1935 and, finally, in the Statement of Policy embodied in the White Paper of 1939. The assumption has, however, invariably proved tobe unjustified and, in every case, sectional interests have secured the defeat of measures intended to conduce to the common welfare. To quote the words of theRoyal Commission &quot;the lesson is plain and nobody, we think, will now venture to assert that the existing system offers any real prospect of reconciliation betweenthe Arabs and the Jews.&quot; Any changes of system possible within the framework of the Mandate could, in the view of the Commission, be regarded as no more thanpalliatives, and would neither remove the grievances of the two communities norprevent their recurrence.   The Commissioners therefore found themselves driven
to recommend the partition of the country. We find ourselves in unanimous agreement with the view expressed by the Royal Commission that the partition of Palestine offers the best and possibly the only final solution of the problem.Conditions to be Satisfied by a Scheme of Partition.5. We consider that any scheme of partition, should, if it is to have areasonable chance of success, fulfil the following conditions :    .(a) The Jewish State should, so far as may now be practicable, be such as tosatisfy the undertakings which have been given by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in respect of the establishment of the Jewish national home, and should afford scope both for the consolidation of the workalready done by the Jews in Palestine and for the further developmentof the Home.(&amp;) The scheme should, to the greatest practicable extent, secure compliance with that article of the Mandate which enjoins that Jewish settlementshall be encouraged in so far as the rights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced thereby.(c) The scheme should be one which, in practice, it will be possible to enforce.(d) The Jewish State should include from the outset more Jews than Arabs.Otherwise it will be necessary for the Jews either to impose politicallimitations on the Arabs or to resort to uneconomic immigration,designed solely to increase the Jewish population,(e). The Jewish State should include as many Jews and as much Jewish landas possible.(/) Substantial areas which are wholly or almost wholly Arab in respect bothof population and of land should, so far as possible, not be included inthe Jewish State.ig) As much land, Arab and Jewish, as is consistent with the fulfilment of conditions (d) and (/) should be included in the Jewish State.ih) The scheme should be such as to contain the fewest possible number offeatures which are so unfavourable either to the Arabs or to the Jewsas to cause lasting resentment.ii) The scheme should, if possible, be such, as will not lead either to seriousrevolt, amounting to civil war, in Palestine or to widespreaddisturbance throughout the Middle East.Scheme of Partition Recommended.(a) Jewish State.6. As directed by our terms of reference, we started by examining the PeelCommission^ scheme of partition. In drawing up the scheme which we now recommended for acceptance we have adopted to a large extent the boundaries ofthe Jewish State proposed by the Peel Commission, but have excluded Galilee, ofwhich 98 per cent, of the population are Arabs and in which 97 per cent, ofthe land is Arab-owned. We have, however, made certain important additions tothe Peel Commission^ State. &apos; These include a valuable area lying to the east ofthe Jordan at the southern end of Lake Tiberias; the southern portion of theBeisan Sub-district, one of the few tracts in Palestine where there are largeperennial springs and where gravity irrigation is consequently possible;, the town of Jaffa and the rich land to the east of it which, under the Peel Commission^proposals, formed part of the Mandated corridor; and an extension of the areaassigned by the Commission to the Jewish State south of Jaffa-Tel Aviv.7. Although the. Jewish State proposed by the Commission has, owing tothe omission of Galilee, been reduced in gross area from 1,930 square miles to1,520 square miles, much of the land omitted is barren hillside, whereas the areasadded, are, on the contrary, fertile and for the most part suitable for intensivecultivation. In so far as taxable capacity reflects land values, the land in theJewish State which we propose is by 10 per cent, more valuable than that in theState proposed by the Royal Commission. Further, our State contains 33,280more Jews and 19,000 more acres of Jewish land than do the Royal Commission^boundaries.8. The map appended to this report shows the boundaries of the Staterecommended by us, - : .[26525]&apos; B 2
(b) Jerusalem Territory.9. We do not think that it is necessary for us to argue in detail thedesirability of excluding Jerusalem and its environs, the centre of two religionsand a focal point of a third, from Arab or Jewish territory. We therefore recommend the establishment of a small Jerusalem Territory, to be administered by a British High Commissioner. The functions of the High Commissioner willbe-    - .      .(a) To supervise the general day-to-day administration of the area comprised in the Jerusalem Territory.(b) To ensure free access to the Holy Places by the adherents of all religions.(c) To settle disputes arising out of the rights and claims of the differentreligious communities in respect of the Holy Places.(d) To regulate immigration into the Jerusalem Territory.With reference to (d), there should be free access into the Jerusalem Territory by both Arabs and Jews, but neither Arab nor Jew should be permitted to take uppermanent residence in it without approval previously obtained.10. The boundaries which we propose for the Jerusalem Territory are shown on the map; they have been so drawn as to include within them the road and railway between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem fi-om the points where they leave theJewish State. Jews will thus be able to proceed from Tel Aviv to Jerusalemwithout passing through Arab territory. Were the Jerusalem Territory limited toan island around Jerusalem and Bethlehem, with a strip of Arab land betweenit and the Jewish State, it would be necessary to provide by treaty for free accessthrough this strip. Under such a system there would always be danger of incidents, which might give the Jews an opportunity of complaining to the world that they were being deprived by the Arabs of the right of free access to the HolyCity and lead to a repetition of the demand made to the Partition commission for a Jewish corridor to link the Jewish State to Jerusalem. As it is intended that the Jerusalem Territory shall have open boundaries, there will be no obstacle to the free passage through it of Arabs travelling between the Arab areas to thenorth and south of it.11. The boundaries of the Jerusalem Territory will include Jerusalem andBethlehem, the broadcasting station at Ramailah, the Lydda aerodrome (whichis likely to be an important centre in post-war Empire air communications) andthe source of the Jerusalem water supply at Ras el Ein.12. It will be for consideration what is to be the nationality of personsdomiciled in the Jerusalem Territory. It has been suggested that domicile inthat Territory should not confer a separate nationality; in that event, personsdomiciled there would, if Jews, be deemed to be nationals of the Jewish State,if non-Jews, of the Arab State. On the other hand, it can be urged that any such arrangement would afford to the neighbouring States unlimited opportunities of interference in the guise of protection of their nationals and thus prevent thesuccessful administration of the area. The matter will be further examined whenthe details of the scheme come to be considered.(c) Arab areas.13. The question of the disposal of the Arab areas raises an issue of con-siderable magnitude. The authorities in the Middle East have consistentlyexpressed the view that no scheme for the partition of Palestine will succeed unless it is linked to a further plan for the proper arrangement of the Levant-States as a whole. The Arab portions of Palestine, both Galilee and the arealying to the east and south of the Jewish State, will be much too weak, botheconomically and politically, to stand alone (the property tax assessment of bothareas combined represents only one-eighth of the total property tax assessment ofPalestine) and, as things stand at present, will have to be fused, respectively, withthe Lebanon and Trans-Jordan. It would be an immense advantage if SouthLebanon cum Galilee and this enlarged Trans-Jordan could, in turn, be fused withSyria and this should, we consider, be the object of Britain&apos;s policy in the levant. It would make partition infinitely easier; it is to Syria (of which theywere citizens prior to its arbitrary dismemberment after the last war) that the palestinian Arabs look and not to the Lebanon or to the somewhat backward Stateof Trans-Jordan. Indeed, fusion with Trans-Jordan would hardly be accepted byNthe majority except as the only alternative to inclusion in a Jewish State. On theother hand, fusion with a Greater Syria would be welcome and would givethose so transferred confidence against further encroachments by force ordiplomacy.
14. The arrangement which we propose involves the creation of four states in the Levant, Greater Syria (consisting of Syria, Trams-Jordan, the Arab residueof Palestine and the portion of Lebanon south and east of Sidon), the Lebanon(as at present constituted but subject to the above slight truncation on its southernborder), the Jewish State and the Jerusalem Territory.15. There are indications that no strong objections will be raised by theLebanese to the proposed slight truncation of their State. Indeed, the transfer toSyria of the area in question may well be acceptable to the Maronites, who would otherwise find their majority position weakened by the accession of 105,000Galilean Moslems. In any event, the transfer, while desirable, is not an essential feature of the scheme and might be left to the S;frians and to the Lebaneseto determine. If it can be effected, Galilee will obtain a physical connectionwith Greater Syria, to which it will pass; otherwise, Galilee will be incor-porated in the Lebanon. The Galilean Arabs, while preferring fusion with Syria,would be unlikely to object to absorption in the Lebanon, to the southern popula-tion of which State they are in all respects akin,16. We deal in somewhat more detail with this proposal in para-graphs 24 to 33 of this Report. While we are not prepared to accept the extremeview that the partition of Palestine is impossible without the creation of aGreater Syria, we are convinced that the creation of such a State wouldenormously facilitate the operation and greatly decrease the heart-buiming anddisappointment (and therewith the riots and bloodshed) which partition is inany circumstances bound to evoke.Extent to which the Scheme of Partition recommended fulfils theConditions prescribed.1.7. We propose now to examine the extent to which the scheme recommendedby us fulfils the conditions prescribed in paragraph 5.(a) Possibility of consolidation and development within the Jewish State.The Jewish State will contain 81 per cent, of the Jewish population ofPalestine (almost all the remainder being in the Jerusalem Territory) and 88 percent, of the Jewish-owned land. It will contain the three cities of Haifa, TelAviv and Jaffa. Almost all the Jewish industries (the only important exceptionbeing the potash works on the Dead Sea) will be within the State, and most ofthe Arab industries as well. The State will contain the best land in Palestine,including 99 per cent, of all Jewish-owned citrus and 82 per cent, of all the citrusgrown in the country, Arab and Jewish. This is an important asset sincecitrus is Palestine&apos;s most valuable crop and, in peace-time, its principal export.The large amount of Arab citrus land included in the Jewish State will constitute a valid Arab grievance, but it is unavoidable if the Jews are to be given the area in which their settlements are situated, since here Arab and Jewish groves areinextricably inter-mixed. The relative value of the land within the Jewish?State can be judged from the fact that its property tax assessment is nearly two and a half times as great as the property tax assessment of the remainder of Palestine.Objection will doubtless be raised to the scheme by the Jews on the scoreof the small size of the State; this is an inevitable feature of any reasonablepartition scheme, since Palestine is, even viewed as a whole, only a small countryand room must be left for the Arab population, which numbers well over a million.Any claim that the State is too small to absorb a considerable number of newimmigrants is, however, easy to refute. Of the total Jewish population ofPalestine, 64 per cent, live in the four cities of Jerusalem, Haifa, Tel-Aviv andJaffa, 18 per cent, in the smaller towns and only 18 per cent, in the rural settle-ments. In the result, 82 per cent, of^the population are living on an area of less than 90 square miles, including the rural area farmed by the inhabitants ofthe smaller towns. In the light of these figures it is difficult to argue that a Statecontaining over 1,500- square miles affords, on the ground of size, no scope for afurther substantial increase of population by way of immigration, if employment for further immigrants can be found.The ideal of a people &quot; rooted in the soil&quot; has always &apos; been dear tothe Zionists, but there are practical limits to the extent to which this ideal is capable of realisation in the circumstances obtaining in Palestine. The PartitionCommission, in paragraph 143 of its Report, propounded a formula for deter-mining the absorptive capacity of rural Palestine. Application of this formulashows that, on the Jewish rural land, the economic limit of population has
exactly been reached while, on the Arab rural land, the actual population is nearly double the population which the land can.economically support. In other words,there is already serious congestion on the Arab land and1 the amount of furthersqueezing up which is possible is very limited.It is clear, therefore, that development on any area which can be allotted to the Jews cannot, in the main, be agricultural; it must depend upon industry,transport and the like, in fact upon the type of economic activity which will allow of a high concentration of population in a very limited area. For such develop-ment there is adequate space within the State. 80 per cent, of all the cultivableland owned by Arabs and 77 per cent, of that owned by Jews is under cereals,the cost of producing which in Palestine is higher than the cost of importingthe same quantity from abroad, with the result that it is necessary to impose an import duty on wheat and flour in order to render the local growing of wheat apajung proposition. If, therefore, area is to be regarded as the criterion of theabsorptive capacity of the State, there are large areas of land, extending to morethan 850&apos; square miles, under cereals, both Arab and Jewish, within its boundarieswhich could be put to other purposes, industrial or agricultural, withoutdetrimentally affecting the economy of the country.(b) Protection of the rights and position of the Arabs.No scheme of partition which involves the domination by Jews of aconsiderable Arab population can be introduced without affecting the rights and position of the latter. The most that it is possible to do is to reduce to theminimum consistent with the formulation of a reasoned scheme the number of arabs who will be left in the Jewish State and to ensure, so far as this is possible by treaty, their equitable treatment. The present Arab population of Palestinewill be divided as follows among the three States : Number. Percentage.Jewish State         .........      343,000 .    31Jerusalem Territory        ......      210,370 19Arab areas ...                ...   -   ...       563,790 50Total     ...    1,117,160 100If these figures were interpreted to mean that the inclusion in -the jewish state of 31 per cent, of the Arab population-of Palestine was the price to bepaid in order to enable 50 per cent, of that population to obtain their nationalindependence, the price might well appear too high. But the.matter goes muchdeeper than this. The price is that of the solution of a problem which has causeddissension and revolt in Palestine for more than a quarter of a century and whichthroughout that period has tended to poison the relations of Great Britain withneighbouring Arab countries. &quot;To both Jews and Arabs,&quot; wrote the RoyalCommission, &quot;Partition offers a prospect and we see no such prospect in anyother policy of obtaining the inestimable boon of peace.&quot; Should this prospectbe realised, as we believe that it will be if the cut is made swiftly and decisively,the sacrifice demanded will not, in our view, have been too great.Owing to the small number of Jews and the small amount of Jewish land,excluded from the Jewish State there is no scope for an exchange of populationor land on any material scale. We consider, however, that special arrangements,both financial and otherwise, should be made to assist those Arabs who desire toleave the Jewish State to do so, provided that they have any prospect of settlingsuccessfully elsewhere.(c) Practicability of the scheme.We believe partition on the lines which we propose to be a practical proposition. That the Jewish State will be able to support itself admits of nodoubt; the taxable capacity of Palestine is largely concentrated in this area andin present circumstances part of the taxation raised in it goes to make up the deficit in the Arab areas. The Jewish State should, after partition, be betteroff financially than is Palestine as a whole at present. The economic position of the jerusalem Territory is more doubtful, but it will enjoy the taxable capacity of theCity of Jerusalem, which is fairly substantial, and it may be possible to improve the revenues of the Territory by giving more official encouragement to tourist trafficthan has been the case in the past. The Territory may well succeed in payingits way; even should it fail, the assistance which it will require should not be large.  The Arab areas will certainly show a deficit.   If they can be joined direct
to a Greater Syria, they are so small in comparison with the whole that the excess cost of their maintenance should not prove too great a burden for the largerState. If, however, the bulk of the Arab residue has to be merged in Trans-Jordan as an intermediate step, the necessity for a subsidy will have to be envisaged, but we trust that this dual approach will not prove to be necessary.(d) Inclusion of a Jewish majority in the Jewish State.The population of the State will comprise 391,725 Jews and 343,000 Arabs,giving a Jewish majority of 48,725.(e) Inclusion of maximum number of Jews in the Jewish State.The Jewish population of Palestine will be divided as follows between thethree States : Number. Percentage.Jewish State      ......      ... 391,725 80-9Jerusalem Territory      ...... 89,480 18-5Arab areas ......       ... 3,210 0-6Total     ...       ...... 484,415 100-0Only 3,210 Jews will be left in the Arab areas and the majority of these arerecent settlers. On the basis of the statistics prepared for the Partition Commis-sion in 1937-38, the corresponding number was then 1,327. There were then only four Jews resident south of the line which is now proposed as the southernboundary of the Jewish State.(f) Omission from the Jewish State of wholly or almost wholly Arab areas.: The following areas have been excluded from the Jewish State in accordancewith this condition :  Land holdings in population. square miles.. Area. Arabs. Jews. Arabs. Jews.Galilee........... 104,990 2,210           530 11Central Judaea          ... 305,660 300 2,390 south Gaza and North-West Beersheba      ... 153,140 700 1,450 35Total      ......      563,790      3,210 4,370 53It is of these three areas that, the Arab residue is composed. Of the com-paratively small area of Jewish-owned land contained within them, 25 square miles in the Beersheba Sub-district, or nearly half the total, have not yet beencolonised.(g) Inclusion in the Jewish State of as much land, Arab and Jewish, as possible.The area of the Jewish State will be as follows : Square miles.Jewish-owned land    ...       ...       ...       ...      ...       ...      520Arab-owned land      ...      ...      ...      ...    - ...      ...      970Roads,,rivers, &amp;c........       ...       ...      ...       ...        30Total       ...      ...      ...      ......    1,520The State thus contains nearly twice as much Arab as Jewish land.(h) Elimination of features so unfavourable as to cause lasting resentment.The complete elimination of features likely to cause resentment is, of course,impossible in any scheme of partition; the most that we can claim for the schemewhich we advocate is that these features are reduced to what, in our view, isthe minimum practicable. Zionists who lay claim to the whole of Palestinewill obviously oppose this or any scheme of partition and. we are convinced that even the most moderate Jew would accept nothing less. But we do not thinkthat there should be any lasting resentment on the part of Jewry as a wholeonce the potentialities of the proposed State are realised and the fact isappreciated that the Jews have at last obtained control of immigration into their
own territory and have attained, to quote the words of the Royal Commission,&apos;1 a Jewish nation, planted in Palestine, giving its nationals the same status inthe world as other nations give theirs.&quot; As regards the Arabs, we do notconsider that our proposals should create lasting resentment either in neigh-bouring Arab countries or among those Arabs who are excluded from the jewish state, particularly, in the latter case, if the Arab residue of Palestine can be linked to a Greater Syria.That there will be resentment, and deep resentment, among the 343,000A arabs who will be included in the Jewish State is certain, but this is inseparable from any scheme of partition; here again, as already stated, we can only claim that we have limited the number of such Arabs to what we consider the minimumpracticable. There is at least reason to -hope that the resentment will be lesskeen among the Arabs affected, who have lived for years in close contact withJewish neighbours and, in some cases, profited from the fact, than would have beenthat of the Arabs in areas where this is not the case, had such areas been included in the State. To what extent this resentment will be lasting will depend largely upon the treatment, political, cultural and economic, accordedby the Jewish majority to the Arab minority. This treatment will also, to alarge extent, determine the prospects of internal peace within the Jewish State.(i) Repercussions in Palestine and in neighbouring Arab Countries.It is impossible to forecast with any degree of certainty what will be the. repercussions in Palestine and in the neighbouring countries of the announcementof a scheme of partition on the lines which we propose. On the Jewish side,there will certainly be trouble with extremist elements, but we trust that themore moderate sections will realise the benefits which will accrue to Jewry underthe scheme. As regards the Arabs, local outbreaks are inevitable, particularly inJaffa, and much sympathy for those so rebelling will doubtless be excited bothinside and outside Palestine. Resistance will have to be faced and dealt with;the extent to which the Arabs in the Arab areas of Palestine will associate themselves with such resistance will depend largely upon whether or not it ispossible to offer them security for themselves by merging them in a Greater Syria.In the neighbouring States, the solution wall probably not be regarded as soinequitable as to warrant an indefinite prolongation of violent opposition. Theview of the authorities on the spot is that&apos; the scheme embodies the maximumconcessions to the Jews which can be granted without the certainty of civil warand of widespread disturbance throughout the&quot; Middle East, but that, provided itis limited as proposed, it may (although no guarantee to that effect can be given)be possible to put it through at the expense of local riots and disturbances only.18. It is certain that no reasonable scheme of partition will be acceptable to either party. We believe the scheme which we propose to be both reasonable and fair in all the circumstances, and think that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould accept and face the risks involved in-its implementation.Features of the Scheme requiring Special Comment.19. There are three features of the scheme which appear to us to requirespecial comment.   These are dealt with below : -(a) Inclusion of Haifa in the Jewish State.The inclusion of Haifa in the Jewish State may well give rise to argument;the port of Haifa is of such strategic importance that there might be advantage from the point of view of the Protecting Powers in an arrangement under whichthe city and the land immediately surrounding it would be formed into an Enclaveand administered by the authority responsible for the administration of the jerusalem Territory. The fact that the population of the city is mixed, consistingof 88,398 Jews and 64,220 Arabs, would afford further justification for such anarrangement. On the other hand, it would have serious repercussions on the economy of the Jewish State. Haifa is an important centre of Jewish industry;Arab industrial development in the city and its vicinity cannot compare with thatachieved and in process of being achieved by the Jews. Any division of territory which placed the industries of the twro large Jewish industrial centres, Tel Avivand Haifa, in different States, and possibly under different tariffs, would lead toincongruous results and be most difficult to defend. For this reason we considerthe inclusion of Haifa in the Jewish State to be the only practical solution.   As
uregards strategic requirements, a guarantee by the Great Powers of the integrity of the States to be set up must be a feature of any scheme of Partition, and thePowers must, for the purpose, have treaty rights to maintain troops, aerodromes,naval facilities and the like anywhere within the area. Provided that the powers have full control over the actual port, an object which, subject to the views of theChiefs of Staff, might be achieved by leasing it from the Jewish State, there seemsto us to be no reason for demanding that the Haifa area as a whole should beplaced under their direct administration.(b) Inclusion of Jaffa in the Jewish State.The inclusion of Jaffa in the,Jewish State is dictated by considerations ofpracticability rather than of desirability, Jaffa-Tel Aviv is, in fact, one town,and it is really more correct to speak of Jaffa-Tel Aviv as a town of 235,030inhabitants 167,580 Jews and 67,450 Arabs than it is to speak of Jaffa as aseparate town of 91,870 inhabitants 66,700 Arabs and 25,170 Jews. If the twotowns were placed in different States, the boundary between the States would haveto be drawn down the centre of a road. The Partition Commission found itselfforced to envisage such a road with a high iron railing, forming the actualboundary, along the middle of it; it is unnecessary for us to dilate on the fantasticnature of or on the administrative inconvenience inherent in such an expedient.Moreover, the isolation of Jaffa as Arab territory would be useless unless acorridor leading to it were provided; apart from the fact that we are most anxious to avoid corridors, Jaffa is now completely ringed by Jewish land, through which the corridor would have to pass, while it would separate the suburbansettlements for workers which have sprung up to the south of Jaffa from TelAviv, where the workers in question are employed.We place no great importance on the preservation of Jaffa as an Arab port;viewed as a port, it is already moribund. It has not been in operation to anyextent since 1936, and at best it provided only an open roadstead, where ships could be moored and unloaded by lighters in favourable weather. Even shouldJaffa be re-opened, the development of Haifa, only fifty miles to the north, as adeep-water harbour will result in the loss of much of its old traffic, Facilitiescan be arranged for Arab transit cargo both at Haifa and, if reopened, at Jaffa-Tel Aviv; we consider that all Arab needs can be thus met without inviting the complications which any attempt to maintain Jaffa as an &quot; island &quot; Arab portnecessarily involves.(c) Inclusion of the Huleh salient in the Jewish State.The Huleh salient is the finger of land which stabs up in the north-east ofPalestine between the Lebanon on the west and Syria on the east. Adminis-tratively, there are arguments in favour of the inclusion of the salient in the arab state. This would obviate what must otherwise be an awkward boundary, wouldgive a direct connection between Arab Galilee and Syria, and would place in theArab State an area which contains 36,500 Arabs and only 5,000 Jews. the argument in favour of its inclusion in the Jewish State rests on the fact that theJews hold a concession, purchased for a sum of about  200,000 from the originalTurkish concessionnaires, for the drainage of Lake Huleh and the adjacentmarshes. This purchase was effected under the direct auspices of Government,which has participated in the cost of drawing up a comprehensive project,extending beyond the concession boundaries, and which in 1939 agreed (althoughon the outbreak of war the offer was withdrawn) to contribute a quarter of amillion pounds towards the cost of a joint scheme. The Jews place great store onthe project, which they claim will provide subsistence for from 3,000 to 3,600families, and would certainly represent as a breach of faith any action whichwould render their concession valueless. Moreover, the Huleh basin is amalarious plague spot, and will so remain unless the project is executed; the Jewsare the only people who can provide the enterprise and capital for its execution,especially as the cost is so high that there is little hope of the scheme provingfinancially remunerative. It is for these reasons that we are of opinion that thebalance of advantage lies in the inclusion of the salient in the Jewish State.The Negeb.20.   Our terms of reference require that we should investigate the possibilitiesof development in the Negeb.   The term &quot;Negeb,&quot; an old Hebrew appellationmeaning &quot;The South,&quot; is loosely employed and covers no really defined area;[265251 r
we use it to describe the triangle of land which extends from the southern edge of the Beduin barley lands in the north-west of the Beersheba Sub-district toAqaba on the Gulf bearing that name, as shown in the map appended to thisReport. We have included the barley lands referred to in the Arab area. Theylie in a tract where the rainfall is both deficient and precarious and where a,careful hydrographic survey has shown that no subsoil water supply exists. Everycultivable acre is already cultivated by the Beduin inhabitants of the tract,who eke out a precarious livelihood from the process, the total area availableaffording to each a holding much below any reasonable subsistence area of cerealland of the kind in question.21. The Negeb south of the barley lands covers an area of 3,780 square milesor more than a third of Palestine. The Jews have always held that, if placedin possession of it, they could turn it to good account, but this optimism seemsto us to be contrary to all the evidence. The tract consists in the main of atangle of limestone hills which have lost practically all their soil as the resultof thousands of years of erosion; a member of an archaeological expedition whichwas recently investigating town sites on the borders of the Negeb described thesehills as presenting &quot; a bare, pale aspect, such as one might expect to find in themoon,&quot; and again as &quot;miles of rocky emptiness.&quot; There is no water in thetract; it has an average annual rainfall of less than four inches, while muchof it has less than two inches or, in other words,.is practically rainless.22. We have considered how this area can best be disposed of. Seeing thatthe Jews claim that it can be developed, we agree that its potentialities shouldbe explored, but the attachment of it forthwith as an island appendage to theJewish State is, in our view, open to objection on several grounds. In the firstplace, both Egypt and Saudi Arabia would protest against the establishment of jewish State land contiguous or almost contiguous to their borders. In thesecond place, we. are strone&apos;lv averse to the creation of &quot; islands&quot; since suchcreation leads inevitably to a demand for connecting corridors. In the thirdplace, and this is the most important consideration, if the tract is now includedin the Jewish State and if, as we anticipate, investigation proves it to be value-less, no matter what warning might have been given in advance world Jewrywill inevitably voice the complaint that it has been misled by the offer of a Statetwo-thirds of which is desert and that it is entitled to reparation accordingly.23. We see no reason to face any of these-complications unless and until ithas been shown that some useful object will be served thereby. We therefore recommend that the Negeb be retained, for the present at least, under the controlof the High Commissioner of Jerusalem. Experts, whose technical qualificationsare as unquestionable as their probity and impartiality, should visit the Negeband explore its potentialities. This investigation should preferably be carried out under the auspices of the International Body, the creation of which we recommendin paragraph 27. An announcement would simultaneously be made that, shoulddevelopment prove to be possible, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be preparedto grant a lease of the area to a Chartered Company willing to undertake such development. The lease would, of course, safeguard existing rights such as the oil prospecting licences already granted. No pronouncement as to the ultimateStatehood of the area would be made nor would it be necessary to specify a JewishChartered Company; none but a Jewish Company would be interested. Should,when the investigation is complete, the report of the experts be negative, the areacould be left under the control of the High Commissioner or, alternatively, bemade over to Greater Syria without arousing either attention or complaint. Onthe evidence, it appears improbable that Jewish interest in the Negeb will extend beyond the investigation stage and, this being so, we would take no action nowwhich is likely to lead to undesirable repercussions, international or otherwise,immediately, or to trouble and new demands in the future.Greater Syria.24, We have already, in paragraph 13 of this Report, advocated there-arrangement of the Levant and the creation of a Greater Syria to consist of Syria, Trans-Jordan, Southern Lebanon and the Arab areas of Palestine.Greater Syria, as thus constituted, would be linked in a loosely knit association ofLevant States with the Lebanon, the Jerusalem Territory and the Jewish State.We have also expressed the view that, unless some such arrangement is adopted,the partition of Palestine will be far more difficult and the risk of failure far greater than would otherwise be the case.   There is, moreover, a strong case on
merits for the restoration of a Greater Syria. It is desired by all Arabs (with theexception of Saudi Arabia) and would be a return to a political order whichlasted for many centuries and was disturbed only by the arbitrary dismembermentof the Levant after the last war. We regard it as important that care should betaken that no pronouncement of any kind is made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment which may subsequently conflict with the attainment of this objective and that Britain&apos;s policy in the Levant should be specifically framed and pursuedwith this end in view.25. The territorial integrity of each of the Levant States would be guaranteed by Treaties which might be Anglo-French or, possibly, Anglo-French-American. The Treaties would also provide for the safeguarding of British andFrench strategic interests. For example, Great Britain would doubtless requireextensive rights in the Port of Haifa for naval and commercial purposes, rights over aerodromes in the several States for military use and rights to maintainJxoops. It would further be necessary to come to an agreement with the french as to the ultimate responsibility (which would have to be British) for the defenceof the States, both inter se and against external aggression, a matter in which,although they might be able to make a contribution to their own defence, theStates would certainly require assistance.26. It is desirable that the States should, if possible, agree to the jointadministration of certain common services, which should include currency,customs, posts and telegraphs and railways. We do not think that it would bepossible to contemplate establishing for the purpose any form of Inter-StateLegislative Assembly as the Jews would inevitably regard this as a means ofsubjecting them to Arab domination. The common services might, however, be administered by Joint Boards operating under specific agreements for each service.We are not at the moment in a position to make definite recommendations as tothe composition and functions of these Joint Boards; this wall be a. matter forconsideration when the details of the scheme come to be worked out. Prima facie,there should be no insuperable difficulty, given goodwill, in arranging for thejoint administration of currency, posts and telegraphs, and railways. Thequestion of a customs union presents greater complications owing to the differenteconomic interests of the Arabs and the Jews. The Arabs would, probably accept such a union (the Lebanese have already evinced their wish for a customs union with Syria) and it may be possible to meet Jewish interests by the establishmentof a statistical frontier, duty being paid or refunded by State to State on thebasis of a statistical record of the goods passed. Such an arrangement gives noencouragement to the individual smuggler and obviates the need of policing along and difficult boundary. Ultimately, however, these questions will be forthe States themselves to decide; if no agreement can be reached regarding thejoint administration of common services there will be no alternative to completeseparation, each State being entirely independent. We regard it as important,however, that the Jerusalem Territory should act, in respect of customs, inconformity with Greater Syria, so that no customs barrier may be establishedwhich would impede the passage of Arabs crossing the Jerusalem State betweenthe Arab areas to the north and south of it.27. Whether or not arrangements can be made for the joint administra-tion of common services, we consider that some form of reference body will be needed to which difficulties can be referred by the States for settlement, and wesuggest that an International Body be set up by the United Nations for thepurpose. This Body would have its headquarters at Jerusalem and would consistof British, French and, if they will co-operate, American representatives, possibly on a part-time basis. The primary functions of this International Body wouldbe to arbitrate on any matters Avhich the States may agree to refer to it for thepurpose and to supervise the observance of the Treaty obligations of the states on behalf of the Guarantor Powers. Not only do we regard the establishment ofsuch a body as desirable in itself, but we feel that its establishment will go far to convince the world, on the one hand, that in furthering Arab unity britain is not actuated by imperialistic motives, and the French, on the other, that thereis no intention of ousting them from a recognised position in the Levant.28. The protection of the rights of minorities, and especially, at the outset,of the Arab minority in the Jewish State, is admittedly a difficult problem. TheStates will doubtless be prepared to give assurances of equitable treatment, and itwill be the concern of the Guarantor Powers to see that these assurances are fulfilled. The International Body will be in a position to &quot;bring to the notice of[26525] d
the Powers any unfair discrimination against minorities, but it would, in ourview, be unwise to place an overt duty on them to do this, as this might encourageconstant complaints on minor matters.29. We fully realise that our proposal for the constitution of a GreaterSyria raises issues of international importance. It will probably be opposed byHis Majesty King Ibn Saud, who will see in it the germ of a future northernArab Federation under the Hashimite dynasty, and probably also by the French,especially those Frenchmen who desire to retain Syria and the Lebanon as an integral part of the French Empire. As regards Saudi Arabia, while in no waywishing to minimise the debt owed to King Ibn Saud for his friendship and good offices, we do not consider that the personal animosities of His Majesty (and theyare little more) should be allowed to interfere with the implementation of what,even were partition not in question, would be the most statesmanlike redistribution-tion of the territories of the Levant. In asking the French to co-operate in theproposed scheme we should have many strong arguments to use. We should beasking them to recognise, in the spirit of the Atlantic Charter, the independence of an area which all through history has been united. We should be asking themto do no more than we ourselves are prepared to do, since we should be recognising the independence of the Jewish State, Trans-Jordan and the Arab part ofPalestine, abandoning our Mandate in the same way as the French would beabandoning theirs. Finally, we should be offering them a seat on the international body and giving them every opportunity to preserve&apos; their legitimate strategic and other interests in the Levant.30. The present developments in the Lebanon are likely to make bothSyria and the Lebanon less willing to grant privileges to the French and, if theFrench Committee of Liberation can be brought to recognise that they haveno means of enforcing wider demands, they may well be glad to enlist the supportof Britain in securing their strategic position by means of an agreement fortreaties between the Levant Governments and a future French Government,with a joint guarantee of frontiers by Britain and France. They could, by thesemeans, at least ensure their strategic necessities, such as an adequate port, agood airfield as an air staging place between France and Indo-China, a wire-less station to form a link between France and her other colonies and such rights as are necessary for stationing troops and in connection with the Iraq pipe-line. We consider it most important that in any negotiations which may takeplace as the result of the recent incidents in the Lebanon, the close connection between the future of that country and of Syria on the one hand and the solutionof the Palestine problem on the other, should be kept prominently in mind.31. In the extreme case, however, the scheme could go through withoutFrench acquiescence If His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to state thatthey will place no obstacle in the way of the fusion of Trans-Jordan and theArab areas of Palestine with Syria and the Lebanon, subject to the satisfaction of British strategic requirements, the French would be powerless to prevent thetwo States in question from extending their territories accordingly.32. As regards the Arabs, there can be no doubt that the reconstitutionof a Greater Syria would be eagerly welcomed; it is the first step necessarytowards the ultimate ideal of an Arab Federation, which is to-day much in the minds of Arab statesmen. Even in Trans-Jordan, the eyes of the Arabs areturned rather towards Damascus than towards Amman. Such reconstitution.undertaken under British auspices, would, in our opinion, not only greatlyenhance Britain&apos;s prestige in the Levant but would go- far to reconcile the arab world to the partition of Palestine.33. If an association of States is established, as outlined above, we considerthat His Majesty&apos;s Government should take an active interest in the promotion of its welfare and development. The chance of success of any political plan will be gravely handicapped by the continuance of the present economic state ofaffairs among the Arab populations, and greatly enhanced by positive measuresof economic up-grading; we believe that the technical backwardness and lowstandard of life of the Arab cultivators in Palestine are among the underlyingcauses of Arab-Jewish, differences. We do not underrate the difficulty ofthe task since the poverty and backwardness of many of the areas are deep-rootedand of long standing; but this difficulty does not blind us to the fact that thequestion is fundamental. The British Governments interest might be displayedthrough the medium of the Middle East Economic Council, the formation ofwhich was recently recommended by the Middle East War Council as a measure for ameliorating the post-war conditions in Middle Eastern countries.
j Satellite Settlements.34. I We are required by our terms of reference to take into consideration the suggestion that satellite Jewish Settlements should be established in areasother than Palestine, for example, in Cyrenaica, Tripolitania or Eritrea.Although we have received some account of conditions in these territories, andalso in Italian Somaliland, Ethiopia and Madagascar, we have not sufficientinformation to enable us to report definitely on their potentialities; we would merely suggest at this stage that, until the question has been finally adjudicated,conquered territories should not be released for other purposes. So far as our information goes, the indications, are that Ethiopia and Madagascar are theonly two African countries which offer scope for Jewish settlement.35. In principle, we favour the idea of satellite settlements and agree thatinvestigations in this direction should be continued, since it is obviously desirablethat countries should be found where Jewish refugees can be accommodated.But we have come to the conclusion that it would be a tactical mistake to connectthis issue with the settlement of the Palestine problem. If, coupled with a schemeof partition, an offer were made of land for satellite settlements elsewhere,suspicion would immediately be aroused that this consideration had influencedthe decision as to the area to be allocated to the Jews in Palestine, the offer wouldbe refused and agitation would be promoted for a corresponding increase in the size of the Jewish State. In our opinion, the creation of the Jewish State shouldprecede any public discussion of the possibility of satellite colonies elsewhere.Once that State has been created, it will be in a position to negotiate with other-Powers, using, if necessary, the good offices of Britain in support of its request,with a view to obtaining facilities for Jewish immigration into alien territories.Timing.36. We have considered when and how the proposals which we have made,if endorsed by the War Cabinet, should be put into effect. It appears to us that three stages must be contemplated.37. The first stage is to obtain the approval of the War Cabinet to ouroutline proposals; until this step has been taken it is useless to proceed to theconsideration of details. In order to expedite this stage we are submitting our report without waiting for the comments of the Chiefs of Staff, to whom theoutline scheme has been referred; while their requirements will necessitate the filling in of many details, we see no reason to anticipate that they will affect themain principles of the solution propounded.38. The second stage will involve the working out of all such details as mustbe in shape before any public pronouncement of policy can be made. This partof the work, which will involve close consultation with the Minister of StateResident in the Middle East and with the High Commissioner for Palestine,should be expedited to the greatest possible extent; it is of the utmost importance that, should a moment occur which is psychologically suitable for the launching of the scheme, the opportunity should not be lost owing to the work of prepara-tion being incomplete. This stage will also cover the making of the militaryarrangements necessary to quell the disturbances which are anticipated when thepolicy to be adopted is announced.39. The third stage will be the announcement of the proposals and the implementation of the undertaking given in Parliament to consult all interested parties, including Arabs and Jews, before putting them into effect. We do notthink that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take any immediate decision as towhen this stage will be reached, but should leave the matter to be decided in thelight of events. A suitable time may be with the collapse of German power inEurope, when Britain is riding on the crest of the wave of victory, and when, inconsequence, its words will carry their greatest weight. But happenings in the levant may dictate action at an earlier date; the important point is that all shouldbe ready to enable the opportunity to be seized when it comes.Conclusion.40. Should His Majesty&apos;s Government take the decisive step of proposingpartition to the Arabs and Jews, we do not think that that policy should again be abandoned.  Partition should be carried through, whatever the opposition.   Were[26525] n 2
the parties to be given the choice between partition and a continuance of thepresent system, one or both might well elect for the latter, not with any intentionof making the system workable, but merely in order to gain time for furtherpropaganda in favour of its own extremist demands. Throughout our delibera-tions we have had two objects in view, equity and finality, and we are convincedthat it is in partition that the only hope of finality lies.41. If, after partition had been effected, the Arabs elected to co-operatebut the Jews refused to take control of the Jewish State, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would continue to administer it as it administers Palestine at present. Theproblem would at least be greatly simplified by the exclusion from the area ofthree-quarters of a million Arabs, and those the most troublesome, who now form part of the population of Palestine. We &quot;do not think that this phase would last for long; world Jewry would hardly condone so flagrant a flinging away of opportunity.42. Should both Jews and Arabs refuse to take over and administer theareas to be assigned to them, we consider that partition should nevertheless beeffected. His Majesty&apos;s Government would continue to administer the jewish state under the Palestine Mandate while the Arab areas would be joined respec-tively to the Lebanon and Trans-Jordan, the latter area being administered underthe Trans-Jordan Mandate.43. There is the further possibility, although we hope it is unlikely, that theJews might accept the scheme and the Arabs refuse. This would give rise to a difficult and dangerous situation since we should be committed, to the handing-over of 343,000 Palestinian Arabs to Jewish control in the teeth not only of theirown opposition but also of that of the Arabs in the rest of Palestine and of the neighbouring Arab States. We consider that every possible step should be takento prevent such a situation arising and it is for this reason that we attach theutmost importance to the realisation of the Greater Syria project, which shouldminimise the risk. The necessity of avoiding this particular development is apoint which must, we suggest, be constantly borne in mind in deciding the timing and method of the announcement of our proposals, but, in the last resort,His Majesty&apos;s Government should see their policy through.44. It is, in our view, imperative that, when the time comes, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should act with unhesitating decision. . Although they are committed to letting both Arabs and, Jews know what is proposed before any changes are carried out, they are not bound to be affected by the views expressed by either side, and it is not necessary for them to enter into negotiations with the interested parties. Any such negotiations would compel both sides to state their maximumcase; agreement would be impossible; and the chances of imposing a settlementwithout armed opposition would be ruined. There is much to be said for aKing Solomon&apos;s judgment when there is reasonable hope of each half of thebaby surviving and leading a lusty life of its own. But it can only do so if the cut is swift and clean.Note of Dissent by the Minister of State.I agree with my colleagues that &quot; a practicable scheme of partition can be devised, and that such a scheme offers the best and possibly the only final solutionof the Palestine problem.&quot; I agree, too, that partition will be more acceptable(or less unacceptable) to the Arabs if it can be linked up with proposals for agreater Syria. I cannot agree that the scheme outlined in the Eeport will contribute in any way towards a solution of the Palestine problem. I believe,on the contrary, that it will provoke such violent opposition throughout the arab world as will jeopardise our whole position in the Middle East, and that we will not be able to rely upon the continuous support of Parliament and publicopinion to enforce these proposals against the opposition which they will certainlyarouse. So far from achieving a final solution of the problem of Palestine, I am convinced that the attempt to enforce a solution of this kind will be quiteineffective, that it will dissipate our prestige which is now so high in the middle east, and that it will delay indefinitely, and make infinitely more difficult, thesolution which we are seeking.The fact that the White Paper is monstrously unjust to the Jews (as Ibelieve) ought not to blind us to the fact that we owe justice to the Arabs, too.It is necessary to remember that the abandonment of the White Paper will be
regarded by the Arabs as a gross breach of faith. It is all the more important,therefore, that when we make this new departure we avoid needless provocationto them. The proposals in the majority report seem to me to be needlessly anddangerously provocative.In the first place it is proposed that nearly a third of the Arab populationof Palestine should be put in the Jewish State under Jewish domination(paragraph 17 (b)). The Jewish State will contain the best land in Palestine,almost all the Jewish industries, and most of the Arab industries as well(paragraph 17 (a)). It will contain nearly twice as much Arab as Jewish land(paragraph 17 (g)). The ports of Haifa and Jaffa are both to be in the jewish state (paragraph 19 (a) and (&amp;),).The proposals in the majority report reduce the area of the Jewish state by 410 square miles as compared with the recommendations of the PeelCommission. The Report points out, however, that much of the land which hasbeen subtracted consists of barren hillside, while the areas which have been added are fertile and suitable for intensive cultivation. The taxable capacityof the Jewish State which is proposed by the majority report is greater by10 per cent, than that proposed by the Peel Commission (paragraphs 6 and 7).And the relative value of the land within the Jewish State can be judged fromthe fact that its property tax assessment is nearly two and a half times as great as the property tax assessment of the remainder of Palestine (paragraph 17 (a)).The proposals of the Peel Commission caused two years of Arab revolt anddisturbance. These present proposals go further in the direction of meeting theJewish claims at the expense of the Arabs in everything except the area of theJewish State. The Jewish State is to be richer, and the Arab State poorer. TheArab State is to be deprived of all its fertile lands and of most of its industries.It is to be deprived of the port of Jaffa. And a very large additional tract ofland, the Negeb, is to be held temporarily under the control of the HighCommissioner of Jerusalem and no pronouncement as to the ultimate statehoodof the area is to be made. The Arabs will certainly suspect that it is being reserved for ultimate Jewish control.All in all, I find it very difficult to understand why we should expect theArabs to react more favourably towards proposals which would in many respectsbe even more objectionable to them than the proposals which they rejected in1937. I am aware that it is the opinion of the authorities in Palestine itself thatthe scheme of partition outlined in the majority report could be enforced againstthe opposition of the Palestinian Arabs. But we have to consider also the effectof these proposals upon neighbouring countries. And I am advised that the reaction there would be of so violent and explosive a character as to endangerour whole position in the Middle East. We must remember, too, that we wouldhave to bear the whole responsibility ourselves, for to the best of my beliefwe could expect no help from the United States, or from the French. From whatColonel Hoskins told us recently, the Americans are thinking of a Palestinesolution on very different lines. The French, for their part, might not be sorry to see us involved in difficulties even more serious than those from which theyare in process of extricating themselves in Syria and the Lebanon. Recent events in the Lebanon, indeed, are probably only a faint reflection of the troubles whichwe may expect if we, in our turn, are faced with the opposition of the Arab world.It is, of course, obvious that any scheme of partition will create Arab hostilityin greater or less degree. It is obvious, too, that populations and lands are soinextricably mixed up as between Jew and Arab that any scheme of partitionwill be unjust to the Arabs. Nevertheless, I believe that the present proposals are quite unnecessarily provocative to Arab opinion, and that they can be modified so as to make them at least tolerable to the Arabs without wrecking or evenweakening the Jewish State.I suggest, therefore, that the Huleh salient and the area Beisan-Nazareth-Tiberias should be given to the Arabs. These areas contain a formidable majorityof Arabs as against Jews (82,000 and 29,000). The frontier would then runapproximately along the North-South road Nazareth-Affuie-Jenin, and theJewish State would remain a self-contained unit. The Arabs would be left withsome (it would not be much) of the more desirable land in Palestine anclsomething to compensate them for the loss of the citrus lands in the coastalstrip. If these areas were omitted from the Jewish State, the Arab State wouldbe left with a frontier which would fit in very much better with the Committee&apos;sproposals.I consider that, granted all the serious disadvantages of a corridor, Jaffashould remain under Arab control, and that the Negeb, too&quot;, should be part of
the Arab lands, on the understanding that if the results of the Commission ofEnquiry were favourable the Arabs would grant a lease of the area to a CharteredCompany willing to develop it. Alternatively, if the Negeb is to come underthe control of the High Commissioner for Jerusalem, it should be made clearthat it is not intended ever to include this in the Jewish State. This, however,-is an undesirable alternative, since it would be difficult to convince the Arabs thatwe would not succumb, in the end, to Jewish pressure and hand the Negeb overto the Jewish State. ,I do not pretend that these proposals, even modified as I have suggested,would be acceptable to the Arabs. But I consider that they would not provokean agitation that we would not be able to control, and that we would have areasonable chance of enforcing them. I consider, on the other hand, that theproposals as they stand in the majority report would be completely unenforceable.(Initialled) R. L.Oifices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,10th December, 1943.
