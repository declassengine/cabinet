Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 566.14th December, 1943.WAR CABINET.ANGLO-AMERICAN DISCUSSIONS UNDER ARTICLE VII.Commercial Policy.Memorandum by Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.1. In W.P. (43) 559 the Minister of State proposes that before Ministersconsider the important issues that are raised by the reports on the Washington-discussions, an Official Committee of all the interested Departments should beset up to sift the material in an orderly manner. It seems to me important thatthe remit to this Official Committee should be extended and that they should beasked to prepare an appreciation of the full implications and effects of theproposals emerging from the Washington talks, particularly on the plans and policies which the Government contemplate in out internal domestic economic affairs.2. When on the 27th July, 1943, the War Cabinet approved the documentsannexed to W.P. (43) 334 as a basis for exploratory and informal discussions between British and American Officials, it was not, I think, regarded as beingcommitted to the policies contained in these documents. Yet there seems to bean increasing tendency both in Washington and Whitehall to regard the ideascontained in those documents as representing the considered views of HisMajesty&apos;s Government. Consequently, it is. becoming regarded as necessary that plans and policies for dealing with our internal domestic problems should conform to the ideas that have been discussed at Washington. And the ideas and proposals that have merged from these discussions would gjravely hamper our freedom toprovide effective and practicable plans or solutions for many of our domesticeconomic and social problems.3. Since the Washington discussions started, the War Cabinet, on the21st October (W.M. (43) 144th Conclusions), decided on the principles whichwould guide His Majesty&apos;s Government in their approach to post-war problems on the basis of the Prime Ministers memorandum W.P. (43) 467, headed War Transition Peace. The decision as I understand it was that attention shouldbe concentrated on plans for the Transition Period, and should not be confusedor overlaid by discussions about long-term schemes except those on which thereis found to be a wide measure of general agreement. The proposals aboutCommercial policy emerging from the Washington discussions are admittedlynot applicable to the Transition Period and could only come into operation someyears after the end of the war. No one can say whether they will proveeconomically or politically practicable when the time would come to bring them into operation four or five years hence.4. They are also highly controversial. If, as the War Cabinet recentlydecided, the Government are not to reach decisions or be in any way committedabout, for example, long-term Agricultural policy, there would appear to be noreason or justification for the Government becoming in any way committed aboutthe much more far-reaching and controversial subject of long-term commercial policy.5. Apart from this, however, there is the fundamental objection that the ideas and proposals which have emerged from the Washington discussions wouldappear to be quite incompatible with the functions and policies which nowadays[26571]Copy No.   0 A
Governments are expected to undertake in internal economic and social matters.Commercial policy cannot, of course, be treated as merely an internationalquestion. It is bound to have a vital bearing on our internal economic structure and welfare mi trade, industry, employment, wage standards and standards ofliving. The ideas and proposals emerging from the Washington talks can broadlybe described as a return to the free operation of supply and demand and freeuniversal competition in-international trade. This is quite incompatible withthe modern trend of public opinion and Government policy in favour of State&quot;action in internal affairs to promote employment, to maintain internal purchasingpower, to safeguard standards of living and to provide social security.6. Under the proposals that have emerged the Government of this and othercountries (except perhaps a country like Russia, which is a complete State-trading country) would deprive themselves of the power to take effective and practicable steps to avoid the dislocation or destruction of vital industries or to maintainemployment and standards of living and would be at the mercy of uncontrollableforces of supply and demand operating under a system which is designed topromote the greatest international competition.7. The argument in favour of such proposals rests on the economic theorythat under free international trade and competition everything will come right in the long run. Possibly though personally.I do not believe that in the con-ditions of the 20th century this would be so. But Governments to-day could not&quot;refuse to take ameliorative action to provide employment and maintain standards of living on the ground that a particular school of economic theory has promisedor prophesied that all will be well ten years hence., 8. The incompatibility of the Washington proposals about commercial policy with our internal economic policy can be illustrated by the difficulty, and indeed impossibility, of formulating any satisfactory agricultural policy if those proposals were adopted. The memoranda that have been issued on agricultural policy by all three Political Parties, Conservative, Labour and Liberal, envisageplans for regulation of production and trade. I would emphasise that, in my view, regulation and restriction are not synonymous terms. I visualise in post-war agriculture a &quot; regulated &quot; expansion. Any practicable and effective plans of this kind would be ruled out by the Washington proposals. In particular, the ideas which are common to both Conservative and Labour Parties for regulationof imports as a means of securing economic stability would be ruled out.9. I cannot help thinking that if the full implications of the Washingtonproposals were examined as I suggest in my first paragraph it would be foundthat they would impose similar limitations on the Government&apos;s power to dealwith other internal problems affecting the maintenance of industries, employment and standards of living. It is for this reason that I would urge that the implications-tions involved should be further considered by all the Departments concerned andthat the whole matter should be reviewed again by the Government before we getcommitted any further.(Initialled) R. S. H.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,,S.W. 1,14:th December, 1943.
