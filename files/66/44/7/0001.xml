THIS DOCUMENT 18 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for&apos; the War Cabinet.   December 1943.SECRET. Copy; No.W.Pr (43) 557.6th December, 1943.WAR CABINET.ETHIOPIA.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.AT their Meeting on the 8th November, 1943 (W.M. (43), 151st Conclusions,Minute 5), the War Cabinet &quot; (1) Recorded the view that it was open to question whether the policy whichthey had adopted in respect of Ethiopia in 1941 still represented thelimits of His Majesty&apos;s Government^ interests in Ethiopia; and thatthere were grounds for reviewing that policy in the light of the changes which had taken place in the general world situation since1941.(2) Appointed a Committee consisting.of The Chancellor of the Exchequer (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Secretary of State for War,The Minister of State,The Deputy Minister of State Resident in the Middle East,to review our existing policy in respect of Ethiopia and to make earlyrecommendations to the War Cabinet as to the lines on which afurther enquiry might be made into the means of improving conditionsin Ethiopia, the persons by whom such an enquiry should be made, andthe instructions by which they should be guided.&quot;The above Committee now submit the following Report.2. We recommend that a Mission of Enquiry should visit Ethiopia,charged with the duty of reporting on the conditions now prevailing in that,country and the measures which could be taken to improve them.The proposed terms of reference of this Mission are set out in Annex I.3. We suggest that the Mission should also be given, for their general guidance, the attached statement on policy in Ethiopia, which was drawn up after discussion between the Departments concerned, and has been approved bythe Committee (see Annex II).4. Since Ethiopia is an independent country, the Mission of enquiry should be appointed by the Foreign Secretary and should go out at the invitation of the Emperor. We think there should be no difficulty in obtaining an invitation,from the Emperor, if it is explained to him that His&quot;Majesty&apos;s Government arenow anxious to find out how the. Agreement concluded in January, 1942 has worked in practice, and what further assistance it may be possible to afford him in the future. A draft telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Addis Ababainstructing him to make an approach to the Emperor on these lines is appended.(Annex III).Composition of the Mission.5.   The  Mission might  include representatives  of the  Foreign  Office,.Colonial Office, Sudan Government and a military representative (who mightbe appointed by the G.O.C., East Africa Command), together with a member with.. [26529]
experience of handling economic and supply problems, who would also be askedto pay particular attention to the financial issues, and a member (possibly thechairman) with experience of indirect rule.The Chairman of the Mission should be someone whose name will carryweight with public opinion, and perhaps who is not too closely associated withHis Majesty&apos;s Government. I hope to be in a position to make some suggestions,on behalf of the Committee, when this Memorandum is discussed by the WarCabinet.(Initialled) J. A.(On behalf of the Committee.)6th December, 1943.ANNEX I. . ,   .   .Proposed Terms of Reference of the Mission of Enquiry.The Mission&apos;s first task is to enquire into and report to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on the conditions now prevailing in Ethiopia and on the degree ofisuccess which has been attained in establishing a reasonably satisfactory stateof administration.In the second place, the Mission should report on the measures appropriatefpr effecting any necessary improvements in conditions in Ethiopia. In thisconnection, recommendations should be made on the following points : (a) The form of administration best suited to the. country, and the lines onwhich a system of Advisers to guide the Ethiopian Government canmost effectively be organised.(b) The administration of justice. &apos; &apos;(c) The  present   and   prospective   revenue   of   Ethiopia,   the   financia,]administration of the country, the measures necessary to maintain a reasonably adequate financial structure, and the degree of assistance which might be necessary from outside sources in the immediatelyensuing years.(d) The degree and type of military aid which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould be prepared to make available in Ethiopia under british control, in order to safeguard British interests and those of the ethiopian Government.The Mission is proceeding to Ethiopia at the invitation of the Emperor.They should bear in mind that their recommendations, if subsequently approvedby His Majesty&apos;s Government, will have to be the subject of negotiations withthe Emperor. They should, therefore, be at pains, without of course entering into any commitments, to have full discussions with, the Emperor, or such of his ministers as he may delegate, in order to ascertain on what lines recommenda-tions are likely to be acceptable to the Ethiopian Government.ANNEX II.The Policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards Ethiopia.1. His Majesty&apos;s Government have had under consideration their policy inregard to Ethiopia. They have reached the conclusion that the present state ofaffairs in Ethiopia may become a reproach to His Majesty&apos;s Government, andthey accordingly propose to obtain the approval of the Emperor to the despatchof a Mission to enquire into and report on present conditions in the country,and on the measures appropriate for effecting any necessary improvements soas to ensure so far as possible that at the time of the Peace Conference thecountry is in a reasonably good state of administration.   The purpose of this
memorandum is to lay down for the guidance of the Mission of Enquirycertain general considerations of policy which they should bear in mind, and toindicate points on which they are invited to report.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot be committed to a long-term policyin Ethiopia beyond the peace settlement, and the present task is therefore to devise a programme which will govern our policy until the peace settlement.Clearly, however; this programme must be framed, in the light of long-termconsiderations.3. The first and immediate need is to improve the government of thecountry. It is for consideration whether Ethiopia can continue: to be governedon a centralised system or whether the traditional system of Government throughRases should be restored to its former vigour. The Rases were in a position to govern the provinces cheaply by securing revenue in kind, but on the other handcare would have to be taken to avoid setting up powerful authorities which might become both a challenge to the Emperor and a threat to neighbouring british territories. Much would depend on the possibility of finding suitable Rases.This is a matter on which the Mission should report.4. Closely linked with this problem is the need for a sufficient staff ofadvisers, both at the centre and in the provinces. The task of obtaining anadequate organisation of advisers is partly a question of money (see paragraph below), but partly also a question of convincing candidates for these ;jv-K? thatthey are going to join an organisation which is doing worth-while work TheMission of Enquiry should consider whether the present system of advisersis adequate, or what steps may be called for to improve it.5. There is at present in Ethiopia a. British Military Mission- f &apos;&apos;\&apos;v inestablishment of 112 Officers and 171 other Ranks. These - officers arc virlv.M\if.responsible for the state of the Ethiopian Regular Army and would aupeav ;ohave raised it to a state of efficiency adequate for the tasks which it is L , .. .obe called upon to perform. The Emperor has asked that the British MimaryMission should be continued, and the Mission of Enquiry should be .. warethat His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to agree to its continuance poviy,on a reduced scale as conditions become more settled -and are also prepared togive a limited increase of air assistance to the Emperor,, if such assistance canbe made available and becomes necessary to enable him to restore order.6. Under the existing Agreement with Ethiopia, His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthas undertaken to pay a &quot; tapering &quot; grant to the Emperor extending over aperiod of four years if the Agreement remains effective for that period. 1^ million sterling was paid to him in respect of the first year. 1942,  1 million for the second year, and if the Agreement continues  500,000 will be paid inthe third year and  250,000 in the fourth year. In addition there is a cushion &quot;grant of  1 million which can be paid to the Emperor as required during thefour years.   This has hardly been touched.This tapering grant has certain advantages, as for instance in stimulating the Emperor to improve his tax collecting machinery, but. it is for consideration whether it will prove adequate for a period during which it is our aim to improve the Government of the country.7. The Mission will be expected to report on the degree of financial help involved in any schemes which they may recommend. While no preciselimits can be laid down, it is understood that the Treasury would be preparedto see some modest increase in the degree of financial help provided under theexisting Agreement, subject to proper safeguards, if this is needed to ensure afulfilment of the general policy set out in this Paper.8. It may be that it would be found advisable to combine the method, of atapering subsidy to meet administrative costs, with additional grants for specificpurposes of economic development. While any long-term commitments .for theeconomic development of the country must await the Peace Conference, thisshould not prevent the Emperor&apos;s advisers from taking into account the probablelong-term economic needs of the country in the work to be done before the PeaceConference, nor should it prevent them from drawing up plans for meeting thoseneeds. It should be a condition that the payments from any subvention to theEmperor would require the approval of a Chief Adviser, who would be empoweredto&apos;withhold payment if the Emperor neglected his advice on important issues.
9. All questions of frontier adjustments must await the Peace Conference,but no arrangements made meanwhile should prejudice the possibility of areasonable settlement of these questions when the time comes. This implies thatthe areas at present reserved under British military administration will not in themeantime be relinquished to the Ethiopian Government (except the &quot;blockade&quot;strip along the Western frontier of French Somaliland., the return of which to theEmperor has already been agreed). The Mission of Enquiry should bear inmind the importance of assisting the negotiations now proceeding for the controlof the waters issuing from Lake Tsana. This question might be linked&apos;with any increase of financial assistance contemplated for the Emperor.ANNEX III.Draft Telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Addis Ababa.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have had under review thequestion of the renewal or amendment of the Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement of the31st January, 1942. They are considering the despatch to Ethiopia of a smallMission with the object of enquiring how the present Agreement has worked in practice and consulting the Emperor about possible amendments in the Agree-ment. Thereafter, the Mission would make recommendations as to what further assistance His Majesty&apos;s Government could afford in the immediatefuture, and how it might be rendered.2. I should be very glad if you would be good enough to explain the fore-going to the Emperor, adding that we believe that a visit of a small mission of this kind would be a great help in fostering an understanding of the ways in which we can best help Ethiopia. You should suggest to him that HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would welcome an invitation from him to send out a small Mission indicated in the first paragraph. this mission would be headed byand would be otherwise composed of IV ^. senior officials and a secretary. Itwould probably spend about two months in the country.
