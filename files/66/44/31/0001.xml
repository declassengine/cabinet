m9 i 9 I(THIS DOCtJMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)secret.P. (45)  58122nd December, 1945 COPY NO.    pWAR CABINETFINANCE OF RELIEFMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer it may be helpful to my colleagues  if I state thefollowing views s u opIeme n t i n g the memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs  (iff.Pi(43) 579).The financial plan recommended for acceptance by theU.N.R.R. A. Council meeting seems to me generally satisfactory.I understand that the contribution which Congress will beasked to approve is likely to reach $1,500 m., representing a rounding up of a figure something under $1,400 m., equivalentto l;a of the national income for the year ended 30th June,1945.      I suggest that our procedure should be on similar lines and that we should set our figure at  80,000,000.In the last budget ATiite Paper our net national income was put at  7,384 millions for the calendar year 1942.      For theyear ended 30th June,  1943 the figure is estimated at approximately  7,8OO,$0% and I suggest that it would bearoper for us to round up our contribution of 1% on this basis to  80,000,000.The expenditure will be mainly incurred by the supply departments who will.procure supplies to meet U,N.R.R.A&apos;s requirements in the same manner as they procure supplies for the United Kingdom.      The cost of relief supplies  should,like that of the supplies for the United Kingdom, most conveniently be charged against the Vote of Credit, and Ithink that there is ample justification for regarding our contribution for relief as a proper charge against the vote of Credit.      Even our contribution to administrative expensesof U.N.R. R.A.  should,   I think, be so charged, especially since it is to form part of our 1% of national income contribution and not an addition thereto.      It will be necessary to seekParliamentary authority for an extension of the ambit of the vote of Credit to cover this charge, and I propose that thenecessary authority should be sought when the next Vote of credit has to be presented,  that is some time probably inFebruary.      It would of course be most improbable that eventhe larger part of the  80 million would be spent during the life of the next Vote of Credit and the balance would have tocome out of further Votes for which Parliament would have to be e a sked.The financial plan recommends that-not less than 10%of each country&apos;s contribution should be available forpurchasing the goods and services of other countries.      Thismeans that any purchases&apos; for relief supplies which we make,for instance,  in Australia would be chargeable against our10%.

Similarly.-, any stocks of overseas origin in theUnited Kingdom which might be drawn up en for relief would be chargeable against our 10/o provided that we should not take-credit for the supply of stocks in the United Kingdom of lend-leose or Canadian mutual aid origin.      The method ofcomputing the 1 end-lease or mutual a id element in any supplies made available from United Kingdom stocks for reliefcan,  I think, best be left to departmental elaboration aswe go along.The Minister .. f Food&apos;s report makes clear the reluctance of the European Allies \to see any of the resources availableto U.N.R.R.A.  used for the benefit of ex-enemy territories.On this point the United Kingdom and other BritishDelegations and the TJ0 S.   Delegation were out voted atAtlantic City by a bloc of countries who are eithercontributing nothing at all or nothing significant,      Weshall no doubt have to return at future meetings of  theU.N.Council to the interpretation of this vote.      Thewords of the recommendation are not free from doubt.    - Ifthe correct interpretation is that moneys available toU.N.R.R.A,  may be used for the supply of ex-enemy territoriesprovided that a claim for payment is raised against them, sucha claim to receive a priority among other claims as may bedecided outside U0N,        AOJ  we need have no objection.      Weare5  however,  not prepared to carry, with, the U. S.  and othersuppliers,  the coot of necessary relief to ex-enemy-territories in so far as they cannot pay,  as an addition toour 1% contribution to U. N* R. R0A.      We are fortified in this&quot;line,  in my view, by the consideration that it is  just as necessary for U,h,RsRc. A,   to concern itself with supplies to ex-enemy territories as to Allied territories which proposeto pa:/ for all their supplies  if it   is properly to assureitself that adequate supplies are reserved for the Alliedterritories which are not in a position to pay.The relationship between U.N, R. R. A,   and the Militaryauthorities provides from my point of view the most difficult problem in the finance of relief,      I share the view that theprime consideration is the prosecution of the war and that wemust avoid impeding- the Military authorities in the speedydischarge of their responsibilities.      It is further impossibleto forecast how long it will be necessary for the Militaryauthorixies to retain responsibility in any area.      It is,however, conceivable that in some area particularly perhapsone in which there might be no resources adequate to pay for importing supplies the period of Military responsibility mightbe considerable and the cost of relief during that periodmight be large.      If none of this cost is chargeable against our contribution to UJ, R0R.A.  we might find ourselves at theend of the Military period in a position of having contributedlargely to relief, but nevertheless still shouldering the commitment of our contribution to TJ0 N. R. R.A.      Therecommendations made at Atlantic City contemplate theintroduction of U.N,R0&apos;;R.A.  into any area    as soon as possible with a view to ensuring the transition from Military to civilian responsibility,at the earliest date that military considerations permit,      I recommend to the attention of my colleagues the proposal that the interested Departments inLondon should consider urgently the possibility of arrangingthat the requirements of the Military authority for civiliansupplies in a liberated area should be at a very early stage

cast in the form of a request for supplies financed toyU.N.R.E.A.      The Atlantic City recommendations speak ofsupplies furnished with U.N.R.R.A&apos;s assistance to supplement supplies made available toy the Military, andthe above proposal does not appear to represent anyinnovation of principle.In view of telegram 604 Remac,  I think we should put on record tooth in Washington and in any putolicStatement;,  that we intend that relief for enemy territories and supplies reaching civilians throughmilitary agency shall in principle toe charged against our total contributions to relief.J.A.Offices of the War Cabinet,S. W. 1. ,22nd December,  1943.
