Various small Yugoslav ships previously seized by the Italians andlying at Malta have now been manned by Yugoslav crews. Six small ex-Yugoslavcargo ships and three tugs being used by the Allies will continue to be manned by Italians.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern and Central Sectors.20. The Germans have reported that on the 13th the Russians launchedheavy attacks and made local penetrations south of Nevel, but the Russians havenot mentioned any unusual activity in this area. Local fighting has taken place during the week west of Smolensk.Gomel Sector.21. The Russians have maintained their pressure cowards Zhlobin and between the rivers Beresina and Pripet.&quot;Kiev Sector.22. The German counter-attacks between Korosten and Zhitomir, whichwere renewed on the 6th, gained some ground. By the 12th the Russians had.halted the German thrust in the main, and had regained some of the ground lost,although on the 14th they admitted the loss of a town 60 miles west of Kiev.Dnieper Bend.23. Russian attacks at Cherkasy continued, and in spite of strong german resistance the town was captured on the 14th. The Russians have also takenZnamenka after first cutting communications from the west and south, and theyare now closing in on Kirovo from the north and east and pushing southwardsastride the railway Znamenka-Nikolaev.Crimea.24. North-east of Kerch the Russians have continued their attacks but havemade no further progress. As a result of attacks by Roumanian forces theRussians were forced on the 7th to abandon their bridgehead south of Kerch.Since then the Germans have reported a number of unsuccessful Russian attempts,to land in this area.General.25. Ground and weather are still hindering operations. In the KievSector the Germans have gained a little more ground, but have not broken through,and the Russians have again been attacking in their turn. Russian progress inthe Znamenka area is a serious danger to the German forces in the eastern partof the Dnieper Bend and may well force them to withdraw in the near future.Italy. (An outline map is included as an inset.)Eighth Army.26. During the past week the enemy has not relaxed his efforts to halt the offensive in the East coast area, and has continued his defence of the Ortona-Orsogna road with great determination and many counter-attacks. Bad weatherhas persisted, with rain playing havoc with the approaches to the river crossingsand mist curtailing air support.In spite of these difficulties, the Canadian and Indian troops have steadilyincreased their bridgehead over the Moro and have managed to bring upsupporting arms and some tanks.   By the 15th the intensity of the enemy&apos;s
counter-attacks was reported to be abating and elements of the Canadians, Indiansand New Zealanders had succeeded in gaining a footing astride the Ortona-Orsogna road in several places. :  ,On the remainder of the front there has been little activity reported for sometime beyond exchanges of artillery fire. The impassable nature of. the CentralApennines precludes any large-scale advance until the Allied offensives on theenemy&apos;s flanks have made sufficient progress to oblige him to pull back his centreto conform with the rest of his positions.Fifth Army.27. Considerable progress has been made in clearing the Mignano gap.British troops have noAv driven the enemy from the mountain mass that lies to thesouth of the main Mignano-Qassino road and have advanced to the westward bendin the Garigliano. North of the road some ground has been gained in the hillsround San Pietro, although the village has not so far been taken. On the 15thanother attack by U.S. forces was started to the west of Filignano.There are indications that once we have gained complete control of theMignano gap the enemy will withdraw to new defence positions covering Cassinoand running north into the mountains and south to the west bank of theGarigliano.Yugoslavia.28. The Germans have launched a general offensive against the Partisans,in which it is thought that some 12 divisions are involved.Driving inland from the coast at Split the Germans captured Livno andTomislavorad.  After heavy fighting in this area the Partisans recaptured Livno.In the Sandjak the Germans captured the towns of Pritepolje and Plevlta(60 miles S.E. of Sarajevo) by the 9th, and are advancing from there towardsSarajevo.Simultaneous drives are being made southwards in the Sarajevo area fromTuzla (60 miles north) and Zuornik (50 miles N.E. of Sarajevo). From the cityitself, which the Partisans had surrounded, the Germans have launched an attackeastwards towards Visegrad.Meanwhile the Partisans have carried out a large number of sabotage attacks against railways and roads in Slavonia and the area between Zagreb and Bihac(70 miles south). .;Greece.29. On the 6th the Germans started a general drive S.W. from Patras whichhas met with strong E.L.A.S. resistance.On the 7th E.L.A.S. attacked Zervas in the North Epirus and drove himout of his Headquarters at Kalenji (15 miles south of Yannina). Zervas reportedthat on the 11th he had regained all lost ground.China.30. The Chinese claim that Changteh, in Central China, which had been captured by the Japanese in their southward drive to the west of Lake Tungting.has been recaptured with the support of the U.S. Army Air Force in ChinaNew Guinea.31. Australian troops have made further advances against strong enemy resistance and have occupied Wareo (about ten miles north of Finschhafen).In the Ramu Valley there has been an increase in Japanese patrol activitynorth of Kesawai, which is 15 miles N.W. of Dumpu.AIR SITUATION.General Review.32. On two days, U.S. heavy bombers operated in strength against targets in North-West Germany. - &apos;  ;In Italy, close support was provided for our armies.Heavy bombers attacked airfields near Athens.[26585] B 2

By the end of the first week in December-, main line passenger services from stations in the centre of the city were still very severely restricted,although some measure of relief had been afforded in that arriving passengerswere not any longer compelled to get out at places as far distant as Furstenwalde(30 miles) or Potsdam (nearly 20 miles). From there surburban trains weresupposed to be available to points near the centre of the city. On these, con-ditions were for a time chaotic. On the 24th November, one which left Wannseeat 5 a.m. eventually arrived at the Schlesischer station three hours later. a passanger on this train said that when he left the station property to the south,was burnt out and large fires were visible in every direction. Owing to the firesand streets being blocked by wreckage he fourid it impossible to get to the Unterden Linden even with the help of a street plan. He managed eventually by keeping as near as possible to the railway track leading to the Friedrichstrassestation. Even then he was compelled on occasion to climb over heaps ofwreckage.Ground reports are now being received in increasing number and from thesethere can be no doubt that the damage to important industries may be as severeas that which is already known to have occurred in the central and fashionable
la /quarters of the city. Among the engineering, electrical and armament works which seem beyond doubt to have suffered are such important concerns as A.E.G.,,-Bheinmetall Borsig, Ludwig Loewe, Blaupunkt, Bergmann and Siemens.A reliable informant who travelled over a great part of the city between the5th and 7th December has stated that the damage was greater than he had anticipated from the press reports. The Wittier Bakery near the Lehrter Station,which is the largest in Berlin and is believed, to have been responsible for halfthe bread supply of the city, wast with its stocks of flour, completely destroyed,and this was one of the most important factors in causing a breakdown of thefood distribution.It has now become clear that an important area in the industrial and working class district of Moabit, bounded by the Putlitz and Ffuttenstrasseup to the railway, has been almost completely destroyed. It is in this districtthat the works of Ludwig Loewe are situated. One of Berlin&apos;s most famoustourist show places and restaurants, the Haus Vaterland in the Potsdamer Platz,is also destroyed.Italy.Genoa. Photographs taken after the attacks on the 29th and 30th October,and on the 9th November, show severe damage to railway facilities and to industrial concerns in the target area. In the Ansaldo works, the principalbuilding has been severely damaged, and various buildings to the west and southof the marshalling yards have also been affected. Of the fitting-out shops, half ofa long shed has been destroyed and a large shed damaged. Central structures ofthe ordnance shops have been destroyed and other buildings severely damaged.Buildings of the girder works, machine shops and electrical shops have also been damaged by direct hits or blast.In the Ansaldo &quot; Savoia &quot; works the girder works have been three-quartersgutted, and a large shop building in the Stabilimento Meccanica group has beenapproximately one-third destroyed and the remainder damaged b)^ blast.Sea-mining.The following reports have been received : 5th August. The Swedish Frans Gorthon (1,822 tons) was damaged by a mine while on passage from Nordenham to Stockholm.12th August. The Oostende 29 and the Oostende 33 were mined and sunk.8th October. A Sperrbrecher arrived in La Pallice with mine damage.8th November. The German Dresden (5,567 tons) returned to Bordeauxwith mine damage.4:th November. A Danish motor vessel of 492 tons with a cargo of peat was mined and sunk north of Grenas.5th November. The motor sailing vessel Energi, with a cargo of lignite, was,mined off Aageleje whilst en route from Aarhus to Copenhagen.5th November. -The fishing vessel Noekken of Copenhagen was mined near the Swedish coast en route to Laessoe^25th November. -Fishing cutter fl. 130 of Hunsted was mined 4 miles north-east of Gillelje (S.E. Kattegat).
