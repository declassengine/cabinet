(43) 577.20th December, 1943.WAR CABINET.hs)AMERICAN OR ANGLO-AMERICAN DECLARATIONS on palestine.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues will remember that the original American suggestion for ajoint-declaration on Palestine was sabotaged by leakage in Washington, withthe result that the United States Government withdrew their offer. Since then the question of a joint declaration has been revived by the Minister of StateResident in the Middle East, and by Colonel Hoskins, President Roosevelt&apos;semissary, who suggested that it should be redrafted in a completely different form;but the Cabinet Committee on Palestine have decided that the project cannot now be usefully pursued.2. Now Lord Halifax, in his telegram No. 5630 of the 13th December,reports that Mr. Hull has told him that he is contemplating a public statement with a view to stalling off increasing Zionist pressure. The statement he hasin mind runs as follows :  &quot; That the United States Government and His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere of course at one in their feeling of sympathy for the cruelties to whichthe whole Jewish race had been subjected, and that one of the purposes of victory in this war was to secure justice for the Jews. As to Palestine, thiswas, of course, within the responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government, butthe United States Government, having regard to the fact that there weresomething like 4 million Jews in the United States, could naturally never be disinterested in the problem and were following with close and constantattention all the facts and- factors that affected it. More than this he couldnot at present say.&quot;3. I am inclined to feel that Mr.&apos;. HuIFs proposed statement does not represent, from our point of view, the best use which could be made of the UnitedStates Governments renewed willingness to assist in damping down agitation.I have therefore drawn up the draft telegram to Washington, of which a copy is annexed, suggesting an alternative line to be taken in Mr. Hulls contemplatedstatement.4. In the meantime, Lord Halifax has been instructed to tell Mr. Hull how much we appreciate his having consulted us and to promise a speedy reply.A.

ANNEX.Draft Telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington.\\ December 1943.YOUR tele gram No.-5630 [of 13th December : Palestine].Please express to Mr. Hull my warm appreciation of his having consultedus over this matter. We entirely agree that a public statement which wouldquieten down Jewish agitation wrould be most helpful. We could acceptMr. Hull&apos;s draft, for we do not think it would do harm, but it seems to us undulyaloof, and we would prefer slightly different approach to question of Palestine.We would suggest introducing the passage from the abortive joint Anglo-American declaration in favour of the Arabs and Jews reaching an under-standing between themselves. I would therefore propose, for Mr. Hull&apos;consideration, something on the following lines : &quot; The United States Government, having regard to the fact that thereare something like 4 million Jews in the United States, are particularlyinterested in the problems raised by the present plight of the Jews, and are giving close and constant attention to all proposals that seem likely to alleviate the Jewish lot or contribute to solving their special problems. Oneproblem is that of Palestine, and this too, though its government and itssecurity are a British and not an American responsibility, is receiving close attention, and it is Mr. HulTs constant hope that an eventual solution will befound that would benefit all Palestine&apos;s inhabitants, Arabs and Jews alike., If the interested Jews and Arabs, within Palestine&apos;s borders&apos;and without,could reach a friendly understanding through their own efforts, this would be exceedingly welcome to the United States.&quot;2. Since Mr. Hull has consulted us, I think we should take the opportunityto express our candid view that in the long run it would be advantageous to all parties if, apart from a public statement, he felt able to warn to Zionist leadersof the dangers of their present policy. Mr. Hull will have seen reports stressingthe grave.danger of an outbreak of violence in Palestine if the Zionists press their maximum demands. We hope, therefore, that Mr. Hull, using his great prestige,will be able to see the Zionist leaders and warn them of the disaster that they maybring on the Jews in Palestine and the damage they may cause to the common war effort if their attitude continues strident and provocative. You could perhapsundertake, for your part, to do your best with Republicans.3. Possible the President, on his return, will be reporting to Congress,publicly or privately, about his journey. If he could say something about recenttension in the Eastern Mediterranean (not solely in the Lebanon) and the necessityfor opinion in the United States to look at the Middle East area as a whole, thatmight also be most useful. The mistake extreme pro-Zionists make is in treatingPalestine in isolation, not as a part of Arab world as a whole.
