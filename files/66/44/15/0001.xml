SJB.0 RETW.P.(h3) 5^5.COPY NO.1UTH DECEMBER 2   19h3*war cabin:?demobilisation and the building- programme memorandum .&apos;by the Minister of Reconstruct ion2.    As requested by the War Cabinet on 9th December(W.M.(h3) 168th Conclusions), i have examined with the other ministers concerned the extent to which it would be possible toincrease the resources available for house-building,  immediatelyafter the end of hostilities in Europe, by expedients not involvingblock releases of skilled building operatives from the services.The numbers given In the following paragraphs relate .to. skilie 1building craftsmen only.     Labourers will also be required,  in theproportion of 14; labourers to 1  craftsman;    but their supply doesnot present the same difficulty.    . Many unskilled and semi-skilledearly . in the war;    and the application of the principle of ageplus length of service will have the result that larg*e numbers ofthese men will be released soon after the end of the war with Germany,and does not cover civil engineering.2.    Deferment of call-up.      The Minister of Labour is preparedto defer the call-up of about 15,003 building craftsmen who were due to be called up to the Forces under existing man-power plans.This will be done without prejudice to the Service intakes recentlysettled by the war Cabinet.      Some of these men may have to bedirected to other industries on the understanding that they willbe transferred back to the building industry at the end ofhostilities in Europe;    but, as the field of transference of skilled men from one industry to another is not large,  it is likely that a large proportion will remain throughout in the buildingmen from the building&apos;industry were called up to the Armed ForcesThis memorandum deals only with the building industry,industry.-1-

3.    indlvIdua1 releases,     without inconsistency with the ;plan for the re-allocation of man-power between the end of war withJ3ermanyand the end of war with Japan,  it would be possible, after the end &apos;of the war in Europe,  to release key men required for instructionalwork in connection with the training scheme for the building indus-try/    These men would be placed in a Reserve with liability to recall.     The numbers to be released in this way would, however,have to be small,  in order not to infringe the ruling against blockreleases.There would be certain advantages in getting out of the Armybefore the end of hostilities in Europe a number of the craftsmenrequired for instructional work at Government training centres.It might be possible to apply this system of individual&apos; releases, to a limited extent^, to other building craftsmen who arenot required primarily for instructional work,h.   Releases from other industries.      There are about 80,000building craftsmen who may be expected to return to the buildingindustry from other industries.      In the estimates of the post-warexpansion of the building industry it has hitherto been a-ssumedthat these men will return to building at the rate of 20,000 in thefirst six months, 20,000 in the second six&quot;months, 35*000 in thethird six months and 5*000 in the fourth six months.Very substantial help could be given to the building industryif this transfer from other industry were -accelerated.      The primeneed is to increase the numbers available in the early months afterthe end of the war with Germany.      The great disadvantage of thepresent demobilisation plan, from the point of view of post-warbuilding,  is the small numbers due to return to the buildingindustry in the early months after the end of the war in Europe.The position would be greatly improved if a substantial number ofthe building craftsmen from other industries could be brought back into building in the early part of the period, when the numbersreturning from the Armed Forces are so 1 small..We recommend that,  in the reallocation of man-power after the-2-

end of the war with Germany,  the Minister of Labour and. NationalService should be authorised to give the highest priority to thereturn to building of building craftsmen who have beentransferred during the war to other industries.,    This, of course,assumes the continuance of power to direct labour in the period between the end of war with Germany and the end of war with japan.    The use of powers of direction will involve some increase in building costs;    but it should be possible to dealwith these separately as special war-time costs.If such authority is given,  it may be possible to securethat all the building craftsmen in other industries return to building in the year following the German war, at the rate of -UO,000 by the end of the first six months,  and the remainingb-0,000 by the end of the second six months.5*    Position before the end of European war.    In order that house building should begin as quickly as possible, we.attach importance to measures by which building craftsmen may be madeavailable for this work even before the end of hostilities inEurope.    The proposed deferment of 15,000 building craftsmenwill increase the size of the pool available for buildingpurposes:    and, with the prospective reduction of the munitions programme during 19hh,  some of the building craftsmen in otherindustries might also be returned to building in the second halfof next year.    If the labour force of the industry is increasedby these means,  it should be possible to make a specificallocation for house building in the second half of 19kk*    Thiswould be a most valuable contribution to the post-war housing programme.6.    Use of military labour.    It was suggested at the last discussion in the War Cabinet that military constructioncompanies already In this country or withdrawn from Europemight be used after the end of hostilities in Europe for civilbuilding work.We have given careful thought to this suggestion.   The

Minister of Labour and the Minister of Works are, however,convinced that the employment of military labour on house-building while skilled building operatives were retained in the armed Forces would be strongly opposed by the building TradeUnions and would cause such grave discontent in the buildingindustry as to jeopardise the whole of the post-war housing programme.    We accept this view.    We do not believe that itwould be politically practicable to use military labour, as analternative to releasing building craftsmen from the Forces,except for a very short period on work which was clearly of anemergency character,;    and we do not think that this very limited use of military labour would make any substantial contribution to our problem^    We make proposals later which willprobably absorb such skilled or semi-skilled labour as theServices can make available in this country.7.    We have also considered whether military constructioncompanies could be employed in making Service establishmentswhich will be surplus to requirements available as a small and temporary contribution to the solution of the housing problem,either by adapting hutments for civilian use, or by dismantlinghuts and erecting them elsewhere for civilian use.    There is,however, a considerable difference between the standards whichsuffice for Service purposes in war and the minimum standards which would be tolerated in respect even of temporary housing to accommodate civilians;    and we are advised that military con-struction companies are not particularly suitable for the workof adaptation involved.8.    In our view the best contribution which the Services can make would be to use military labour for some of their work onwhich civil labour would otherwise have to be employed.The Ministry of Works estimate that about 8,000 civiliancraftsmen are at present engaged on maintenance work for thethrees Services.To the extent that construction companies or other technicalunits are available,  they should in our view be employed on-h-

this, maintenance work in order to reduce this call on civilbuilding labour.    They could also be used, with little risk ofthe labour troubles referred to in paragraph 6 above, on workin connection with railwasrs, docks and other public utility undertakings, and for clearance work in certain towns, -such asPlymouth, which have suffered specially heavy damage from air attack.We also consider that the Services should clear the sitesof redundant establishments before relinquishing them and shoulddismantle defence works.9*    Summary,      By refraining from calling up 15,000 buildingcraftsmen who would, otherwise have gone into the Forces(paragraph 2) and by accelerating the return of building crafts-men from other industries (paragraph k), we can materiallyincrease the strength of the building industry during the early stages of the transition period after the end of war withGermany.     This will give substantial help to our post-warhousing programme, since it is in this early part of the periodthat the numbers of building craftsmen coming out of the forces under the demobilisation plan outlined in W.P.(h3) h9k will beso small.      still further help will be afforded if it is found possible to transfer some of these men to house building, and to release from the Forces some of the key men required for ins true-national  work, before the end of war with Germany (paragraphs 3and 5).If all these proposals are adopted,   the probable rate of expansion of the building industry in the early stages after theend of the war with Germany will be slightly greater than thatassumed in the original estimate put forward by the Minister ofWorks in P.R. (h-3) UU.In addition,  some further relief could be afforded by us ingmilitary labour on work for which civilian building labour would otherwise be required, on the lines indicated in paragraph 8 ofthis Memorandum.      The effect of these&apos;proposals on the post-war

housing programme cannot, however, be expressed quantitatively.10.    we attach, for convenience of reference, a- Table showingthe probable rate of expansion of the b\iilding industry, underthe scheme outlined in W.P- (h3) h9U, and under the proposals putforward in this Memorandum.     These estimates are necessarilyprovisional.      They take no account of the possibility of allocating further labour to housing work before the end ofwar with Germany,w.hp Richmond Terrace,  S-W.1.1hth December, 19h3.
