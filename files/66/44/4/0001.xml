(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)/ ^3 ISt 0 K E T *W,P. (45)554 / COPY NOO3rd DECEMBER, 1945. :\IwWAR CABINET.EDUCATIONAL RECONSTRUCTIONMemorandum by the President of the Board of Education.At the meeting of the Y/ar Cabinet held on December 2nd(W.M.(43) 165th Conclusions), I undertook to give furtherconsideration to the following points ;1,   Title of the Minister.Provision will be included in Part I of the Bill whereby the Ministry of Education will continue to have the title of&quot;Board of Education&quot; and the Minister will continue to have the title of &quot;President of the Board of Education&quot;.     This will notnecessitate redrafting the rest of the Bill, where it will belegitimate to use the expression &quot;Minister&quot;.2*   Recovery of cost of meals.I have examined the suggestion made by the War Cabinetthat the most satisfactory course would be to omit from thepresent Bill all provisions in regard to school meals.     Thereare obvious advantages in this course.     In any case, the presentlegal basis for the administration of school meals and milk^continues until 1st April, 1945,     It will be understood, however that unless the future of school meals and milk haB been settled in connection with the Governments scheme for children^allowances &quot;by that date*. there will need to tee an amending Billproviding for the continuation of these services.On the other hand, the White Paper stated -that thepresent power of local education authorities of providing meals

and milk would be converted into a duty, and it has beensuggested that the position could be satisfactorily met bythe insertion of a clause on the following lines:&quot;It shall be the duty of the local education authorityto make provision for the supply to children and youngpersons in attendance at county schools, auxiliaryschools, nursery schools, special schools and young people&apos;s colleges, of meals and milk to such extent and subject to such conditions (including directions as to the recovery or non-recovery of the cost) as maybe directed by order of the Minister.&quot;Parliamentary Counsel advises that., having regard to the specific reference to the recovery of cost in respect ofthe provision of boarding accommodation   and clothing, the.absence of any reference to recovery of cost in respect ofmeals and milk would create a presumption that the Ministerspowers to make conditions did not extend to the recovery ofthe cost.A clause on these lines would be in substitution forClause 48.    Clause 50 would remain because the provision of clothing is not on all-fours with the provision of meals and milk and is, moreover, only a power and not a duty.Parliamentary Counsel has undertaken to redraftClause 51 to cover recovery of cost in respect of boardingaccommodation and clothing only.Whether provisions regarding milk and meals are includedin the Bill or not, it will be necessary, in any memorandumaccompanying the Bill, to explain that the position in regardto the provision of meals and milk will have to be adapted inconformity with such decision as the Government may take aboutchildren1s allowances under the Social Security scheme.

3 o     Dutiesof teachers in relation to school mealsIf there were no reference to milk and meals in the Bill,sub-section (St) of Clause 49 would automatically disappear0If, however, a clause on the lines suggested in paragraph 2were adopted, it would be&apos;necessary to define the positionof teachers in relation to school -meals0My colleagues asked me to reconsider the wording of clause 49(2) ,     This clause gives the local education authoritynew powers enabling them to require teachers to exercisesupervisory functions in relation to school meals, but not torequire them to undertake other duties in relation thereto0The present position is governed by Section 85 of theEducation Act, 1921, which reads as follows&quot;No teacher seeking employment or employed in a public elementary school shall be required as, part of his duties to supervise or assist, or to abstain from supervising or- ass: ntj &apos;V2, in the provision of meals, or in the collectionof the cost thereof&quot;,(There is no similar provision in the Scottish Education ActsTeachers have shown themselves very ready to participate in this work on a voluntary basis, a fact to which the successof the School Meals Service is very largely due,    &apos;Some .Authorities have taken advantage of the readiness of teachers tohelp hy requiring them to undertake the duties of kitchen-hands0Such a use of teaching power is an unwarrantably extravagant wayof carrying out this service, since in peace-time far cheaperlabour is locally available for carrying out the preparation andserving of the mealsI would,  therefore, prefer to leave Clause 49(2) as it standsR ,A QB oBoard of Education,3rd December, 19436  -
