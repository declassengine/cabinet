THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMEHTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 571.17th December, 1943WAR CABINET.POST-WAR HIGHWAY POLICY.Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.1. The Reconstruction Problems Committee have had under review proposals by the Minister of War Transport on post-war highway policy.They have agreed to submit for the approval of the War Cabinet the follow-ing recommendations : -(a) The present trunk road mileage should be approximately doubled by thetransfer to the central Government of responsibility for another 4,500miles or so of the existing Class I roads. This would leave with thecounty and county borough councils the responsibility for 18,000 to19,000 miles of Class I roads (roughly 80 per cent, of the total mileage).(b) Consideration should be given.to adjustments in the existing system of grants to local authorities; and this opportunity should be taken of putting the grants for road works on a more consistent footing.(c) In suitable cases, the Minister of War Transport should be empowered to reserve new roads for the sole use of motor traffic.(d) The programme of work in the years immediately following the war should be concerned in the main with (i) overtaking arrears of maintenance;(ii) resuming suspended works of improvement, subject to their being in accordance with post-war highway and planningpolicy; and(iii) undertaking other works of improvement essential to public safety or to the reconstruction of blitzed areas; and also worksrequired on economic grounds, especially those likely to assistareas in urgent need of new industrial development.(e) For this purpose local authorities should be encouraged to proceed at once with such preparations as are possible, a preference naturally being given to schemes interrupted by the outbreak of war, subject to thesebeing in accordance with post-war highway and planning policy.(/) The post-war highway programme should be designed in conformity withfuture planning policy, and the increased influence which the Govern-ment will exert on the location of industry and of the industrial popu-lation; the rate of execution being determined from time to time inthe light of traffic requirements and the general economic conditionsthen prevailing.(g) The Government should declare its intention to proceed with the pro-vision of a road-crossing of the Severn Estuary on the ground of itsgreat economic importance to South Wales.(h) Other major schemes of improvement, though not considered at present of high priority, should, nevertheless, be prepared with a view toforming part of a long-term comprehensive programme of publicworks. These should be ready to be put in hand when indications are seen of an approaching decline in the general level of employment.2.   The detailed considerations on which these recommendations are basedare set out in R.P. (43) 27 and 30, as modified by the Conclusions of the Recon-struction Problems Committee recorded in R.P. (43) 10th Meeting, Minute 2.[26566]Copy No.
3. I invite the War Cabinet to approve the recommendations summarised above and to authorise the Minister of War Transport to make an announcementof policy in the terms set out in the Appendix to this Memorandum.W.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,17th December, 1943.APPENDIX.Draft Statement on Highway Policy to be made in Parliament.1. The Government have considered on what lines the improvement anddevelopment of our highway system could best proceed after the war and theythink that some preliminary indication of their general views would be helpful tohighway and local authorities in framing their own plans and to.others who are interested.2. Proposals to improve and extend the road system must in the first placebe viewed in relation to the efficiency and development of our inland transport system as a whole.3. Such proposals must also be framed with full regard to the interests of town and country planning, the location and requirements of industry, includingagriculture, and other aspects of national development. The Ministry of war transport will therefore maintain contact with the many other departmentsconcerned, as well as with the local and highway authorities.Trunk Roads.4. In the Government^ opinion there is a clear case for extending thepresent trunk road system, and they have it in mind, in consultation with theCounty Councils, to frame legislation which would substantially increase and perhaps go near to doubling the existing mileage of trunk roads (about 4,500 miles)which is at present vested in the Minister of War Transport.5. Where a by-pass forming a link in a trunk road passes through the areaof a County Borough it will, probably be found right to vest this section also inthe Minister.6. Discussions will be opened at once with the Highway Authorities in orderto select the additional roads to be scheduled as trunk roads. It is intended tocontinue the arrangements under which the existing authorities can act as theMinisters agents.7. It may also be found necessary to plan some new trunk roads where theline of the existing road is not satisfactory, in order to secure the full advantageof new developments.8. The possibility of simplifying the present somewhat complicated systemof grants to highway authorities is being considered.Motorways.9. Consideration has been given to proposals made in various quarters forconstructing a new system of motorways to relieve the pressure on our existingmain roads.10. While the Government do not think that there is sufficient justification for embarking upon the construction of a widespread system of entirely newroads reserved exclusively for motor traffic, they are satisfied that it will be expedient and economical to construct suitable lengths of roads of this type whereengineering and traffic considerations make this course preferable to extensiveremodelling of existing roads in an attempt to make them more suitable andsafer for mixed traffic.11. In the selection of lengths of road for this treatment, the ministry would be guided by the proper development of our transport system as a whole,the convenience of road traffic and sound principles of town and country planning.Due regard would be paid to cost and amenity.
12. There is a strong oase for reserving exclusively for motor traffic someof the by-pass and other roads designed to enable motor traffic to avoid passing through built-up areas, but the value of which is too often seriously reduced bytheir use for mixed traffic and by the frequent access accorded to traffic enteringfrom, minor roads. Proposals to give the necessary authority for this purpose will be laid before Parliament in due course.Priority of Work after the War.13. The roads of the country have, on the whole, stood up well to the heavy demands of war, but there will inevitably be large arrears of work, both of main-tenance and improvement, to be carried out as conditions permit. Tor some considerable time after the end. of hostilities in Europe attention will inevitably be largely concentrated on overtaking these arrears. The rate of execution ofthe highway programme must be adjusted from time to time to general economicconditions, but, without imposing any undue rigidity, the following order of priority will be a good guide during the transitional period :  Overtaking arrears of maintenance.Resumption of works closed down during the war, if still desirable.Works essential to public safety or to reconstruction of blitzed areas,and works of special value to areas- in urgent need of new industrialdevelopment.The elimination of obstructions to traffic on important roads, such asweak or narrow bridges, level crossings, and the linking up of improved sections of roads on important traffic routes.Other works of improvement of high economic value.14. This list is not intended to suggest any absolute priority in the sense that every highway authority would be expected to complete all its maintenance workbefore it turns to works of improvement; in practice there must be overlappingof the different items.New Works.15. It is the intention of the Government to encourage the preparation of major schemes of improvement, including some not considered at present of high priority, with a view to their forming part of a long-term and comprehensiveprogramme of public wTorks available and ready to be put in hand if general economic activity begins to give indications of an approaching decline.16. Without precluding progress in the preparation of other schemes that can be shown to be desirable on traffic and economic grounds, the government attach importance to the provision of a new road crossing of the Severn Estuaryon the ground of its great economic value to South Wales. It is thought that thereinvestigation of the project for a Severn Barrage, which has just been instituted by the Minister of Fuel and Power, should not stand in the way of the provisionof a new crossing in view of the time which would necessarily be occupied inconstructing the Barrage, if one were to be undertaken.Preparatory Work.17. Highway Authorities will be encouraged to proceed at once with suchpreparations as are possible in present circumstances to enable the policy outlined in this memorandum to be pursued as rapidly as is practicable.
