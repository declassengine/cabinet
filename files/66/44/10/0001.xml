THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITTANIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERmiBNT,OOet.Copy No.   v,December, 1943*4,3)560.WAR   CABINET.Demobilisation and the Navy.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.The Admiralty agree generally.with the recommendations of the Demobilisationcommittee in W.P. (43) 494.     The special difficulties which will face the Navy duringservice overseas - to which the Admiralty have the strongest objection, as wellas some other proposals upon which I feel it necessary to put the Admiralty&apos;s viewbefore my colleagues.WEIGHT FOR OVERSEAS service in paragraphs 45 and 46 the Committee recognise that conditions in the Navymake it impossible to distinguish between home and overseas service, and they goon to propose in paragraph 47 that this concession should be limited to the Army,The Admiralty feel strongly that such a distinction would have embarrassingrepercussions in the Navy.      In fact, a very large proportion of men serving in theNavy will have seen service overseas.     After the defeat of Germany, the Navy willbe aware that they are receiving a much smaller proportion of demobilisation thanthe Army, and if H.M. Government in addition recognise that overseas service in theArmy gives a claim to earlier demobilisation, this would further emphasise the disparity between the. treatment accorded to the two Services and heighten, anyfeeling aroused in the Navy on that score.      Certainly, if such a preference is-granted to the Army, there will be strong pressure to extend it to the other services including the Navy.     It&apos;would be impossible to make any concession to such pressure in the Navy because naval requirements and administrative difficulties would combineto make such a scheme unworkable.For these reasons the Admiralty would be most strongly against making anyL fference between service at home or overseas in any of the Services.^BLOCK&quot; RELEASES.Although the Committee recognise in paragraph 35 of their Report that the cumulative effect of occupational preferences might be so serious as to wreck thescheme which they propose, they do not entirely rule out the possibility of a &quot;block&quot;the period after Germany has been defeated are fully recognised in that paper (seeparagraph 7).     It contains, however, one proposal - a special weighting for

release of building operatives (Paragraph 37)*     The Admiralty feel that a concession to one occupation would make it extremely difficult to resist claims on behalf of other equally important   occupations, e.g. miners.As stated in the. Report;    The admiralty cannot yet tell -whether any partof the demobilisation scheme now recommended can be applied to the Navy duringthe period following the defeat of Germany.     Naval requirements must be paramountand&apos;the Navy must be assured of retaining the services of trained and experienced, men.In any case, in view of the bitter experience of the 1919 demobilisation,the Admiralty are emphatically of the opinion that all releases on occupationalgrounds, either before or after the cessation of hostilities, should be by individualapplication vouched for by a Government Department under the existing machineryfor temporary, or indefinite, release.COHPENSATION FOR MEN EMPLOYED AFTER THE EUROPEAN ARMISTICEThe Committee recommend in paragraph 12 that consideration should be given,to the possibility of providing compensation in some form, e.g. by in-proved payduring service, or by gratuities on its termination, for men who would otherwise be entitled to demobilisation.      The Admiralty consider it important that anysuch inducement26 should be one with immediate tangible effect.     For thispurpose an immediate increase of pay (which might be called a war bonus) and notmerely the promise of a further lump sum at some indefinable date in the futurewhen the man leaves the Forces, will, in the opinion of the Admiralty, be imperative.xNOTE.     Although only men with an entitlement to demobilisationare being considered in the present context, the Admiraltyfeel bound to draw attention to -the obvious difficultieswhich would result if there were different scales of pay for &quot;hostilities only&quot; personnel and regular personnelserving together in the same units - i.e, if specialinducements provided for the former were not also givento regulars.

Y/IDOTffiRS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN;In paragraph 42 of their Report, the Committee recommend thatwidowers with one or more dependent children should he given the samepreference on demobilisation as that recommended for married men.There may&apos; well he oases where no advantage will he obtained by thechildren through the early release of their widower father.     On theother hand, if, the early release of the father is desirable on compassionate grounds, the Committee&apos;s recommendations will generally not providesufficiently early release,.The Admiralty are therefore of the opinion that the release ofwidowers with dependent children should be dealt with under the existing&quot;hardship&quot; procedure which provides for   investigation of each individual case and the immediate release of those who deserve it,GENERAL..The Admiralty consider it very necessary that any announcement ofdemobilisation plans should make it plain(a) that the extent of Naval demobilisation on the defeat of germany must necessarily be very limited(b) that the Government are Considering improvements in the emolumentsof the Forces retained after the end of the war with.,Germany,SUMMARY OF RBCOMMENDftTIONS.To sum up, the Admiralty strongly recommend that:-(l) No weighting should be allowed for overseas service in any of HisMajesty&apos;s Forces.(2) No &quot;blocJ^&quot; releases- on occupational grounds should be permitted.(3) The inducement provided for men retained after the defeat of germany should be one with immediate effect.(4) &quot;widowers with dependent children should be dealt with under the&quot;hardship&quot; procedure..(5) An announcement should be made emphasising that little demobilisationfrom the Navy will be possible until Japan has been defeated and giving promise of improved emoluments,, A, V.
