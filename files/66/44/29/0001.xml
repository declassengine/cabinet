THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1943.SECRET Copy No.W.P. (43) 579.21st December, 1943.WAR CABINET.QUESTIONS ARISING OUT OF THE COUNCIL MEETING of unrra.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE War Cabinet have before them the Minister of Food&apos;s memorandumon the Atlantic City session of UNRRA (W.P. (43) 567). I think the Ministerand his delegation are to be congratulated on the able manner in which theyhandled our case and secured agreement for proposals which might easily have led.to considerable disagreement if put forward with less tact and skill.Certain follow-up action will be needed on the part of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment: (a) Questions have already been asked in the House of Commons about theCouncil meeting, and on the 15th December the Leader of the Housestated that the Resolutions adopted at Atlantic City would bepublished as a White Paper. Copies of such a White Paper areavailable in proof form. It will be seen that the suggested white paper does not do more than reproduce the resolutions and reportsof the Council.(b) It is desirable that, in addition to the publication of the White Paper,Parliament should be given an early opportunity of discussing&quot;UNRRA and the results of the meeting at Atlantic City. If suchan opportunity is arranged, the Government will be pressed for astatement of policy and, in particular, for an indication of what theycontemplate in regard to the provision of a financial contributionpursuant to Resolution 14. No doubt the tidiest arrangement wouldbe for the Chancellors financial proposals to be made known on thesame occasion as any general statement is made. The United states administration have obtained from Congress authority to ask foran Appropriation for UNRRA, but have not yet asked for an actualAppropriation. I do not think we need wait for their cumbrousmachinery to complete its operations before taking action ourselves.(c) We shall have to consider who should represent His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment on the Committees which have been set up by the Council of unrra. The most important appointments are the United kingdom representatives on the Council itself, and the Central Committee, onthe Committee on Supplies and on the Committee on financial control. In addition we are called upon to designate a member forthe Far Eastern Regional Committee and both a non-voting chairman and a voting member for the European Regional Committee. I havenot yet had an opportunity of consulting any of my colleagues on themost suitable representation on the two regional committees, whichwill clearly be of great importance. I hope to be able to make proposals in the near future. The Minister of Food and the Ministerof State have discussed the other appointments, and recommend asfollows : of the Council and of the Central Committee:   theMinister of State.Alternate serving on the Council and Central Committee inthe United States : the Minister Resident in Washington for supply.12229   [26608]
Member of Committee on Supplies :   the Minister Resident in washington for Supply. &apos;;Member of the Committee on Financial Control: Senior TreasuryRepresentative in Washington.Chairman of European Regional Committee : The Minister, ofFood.I understand that the Minister of Food is willing to serve as Chairmanof the European Regional Committee provided that some, otherarrangement can be made if experience shows that this position makestoo great a call upon his time.(d) It will be necessary to decide what- assistance we can give UNRRA inthe way of seconding experienced officials to the Administration. TheMinister of Food has drawn attention, in paragraph 10 of his memorandum, to the importance, from our own point of view, of ourproviding people who can help keep the new organisation on the rails.Governor Lehman has asked for the services of a number of officials.I am sure that we should be wise to let him have some good men, even at some sacrifice to ourselves, since, if his Administration is badlyrun by people who do not know how to go about their job, we shall be directly affected. The Minister of Food and the Minister of Statehave been discussing proposals in the&apos; light of information about postsLehman wishes to fill. I hope that when Ministers are asked forassistance they will treat the request sympathetically, and that&apos;theChancellor may be able to deal suitably with the pension rights of anyestablished civil servant who may be transferred to UNRRA.A.

THE RESOLUTIONS ON POLICY OF THE FIRST SESSIONOF THE  COUNCIL  OF  THE  UNITED  NATIONS relief and REHABILITATION ADMINISTRATIONOn November 9, 1943, forty-four United and Associated Nationssigned the Agreement establishing the United Nations Relief and rehabilitation-tion Administration. The next day the representatives of these nations met atAtlantic City, New Jersey, in the First Session of the Council establishedby the Agreement, to provide for the organization of the Administration andto lay down the broad policies to-guide its activities. i:    ;They had before; them the task&apos; of taking the first steps to make effectivethe determination of the forty-four nations that the&apos;population of areasF irated by the armed forces of the United. Nations shall receive aid andrfeiief from their suffering, food, clothing and shelter, aid in the preventionof pestilence andjn the recovery of the health of the people, and that prepara-tions and arrangements shall be made for the return of prisoners and exilesto their homes and for assistance in the resumption of urgently neededagricultural and industrial production and the restoration of urgently neededservices.This involved consideration of the scope of activities to be undertaken by the Administration, the procedures for obtaining supplies and distributingthe burden as equitably as possible, the methods for assuring equitableapportionment and distribution:of supplies, as well as other questions relatingmore particularly to the administration of relief and rehabilitation measures in the field and to relations with other governments and organizations. Finally,rules were required to govern the conduct of the. Administration itself, so asto secure effective&apos; representation of the. interested nations in the formulation of the policies of the Administration and to facilitate the operations of theDirector General in carrying but these policies.The results of the deliberations of the Council are embodied in the resolu-tions which follow; ,,       ...rxPART I.-GENERAL POLICIESRESOLUTION No. .1A Resolution relating to the scope of the activities of the AdministrationResolved,      , \&apos;.&apos;..&apos;e &quot;r,&apos;^n&apos;&apos;lio 1  l?&apos;&quot;&apos;That the following shall be the broad. policies of the Administration-withrespect to the scope of its 1 activities: ,.-I. AREAS. IN WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION WILL operate the exact geographical areas in which the Administration will operate andthe kind of operations it will undertake in each case must be determinedby the Director General (in the light of policies laid down from time, to time by the Council) only after consultation with, and with the consent of, thegovernment or authority (military or civil) which exercises , administrativeauthority in the area. . The Administration&apos;s activities in seeking to achieve the objectives referred to in the preamble of the Agreement setting it up willbe governed as follows: -.(1) In the case of a liberated area in which a government or recognizednational authority does not yet exercise administrative authority, theAdministration will operate from such a time and for such purposes as maybe agreed upon between the military command and the Administration31857 &apos; A3
and subject to such control as the military command may find necessary.The Administration shall, so far as circumstances permit, seek the advice of the government or recognized national authority concerned.(2) In the case of a liberated area in which a government or recognizednational authority exercises administrative authority, the administration will operate only after consultation with, and with the consent of, thegovernment or recognized national authority concerned regarding the formof activities to be undertaken by the Administration within the whole or part of such area.(3) If it appears necessary for the Administration to operate in an^ enemy or ex-enemy area in carrying out the purposes of the Agreement, it will doso only from such a time and for such purposes as may be agreed upon between the military command, the established control authority or dulyrecognized administration of the area on the one hand and the Adminisi^ Jtion on the other, and subject to such control as the military commandor the established control authority may find necessary; provided that theCouncil approve the scale and nature of the operations it is proposed toundertake and the standard of provision, and that all expenses connectedwith such possible operations in an enemy or ex-enemy area should becarried by the enemy or ex-enemy country concerned. The director general will consult with the military command or established control authorities having control of enemy or ex-enemy areas with a view to securing information as to any surpluses of supplies from time to time available in such enemy or ex-enemy areas from which relief and rehahili-tation import requirements of liberated areas might be met.Nothing in the above should be taken as preventing the Administrationfrom carrying on activities in other areas in order to perform the, tasks laid upon it in the Agreement, provided that the government or authority (mili-tary or civil) exercising administrative authority in the area concernedagrees.II. THE RANGE OF SERVICES WHICH THE administration will PROVIDEThe supplies and services of which the Administration will seek to ensurethe provision fall under four heads:(1) Relief supplies: essential consumer goods to &quot;meet immediate needs,such as food, fuel, clothing, shelter, medical supplies.(2) Relief services: such as health and welfare, assistance in caring for,and maintaining records of, persons found in any areas under the controlof any of the United Nations who by reason of war have been displacedfrom their homes and, in agreement with the appropriate governments,military authorities .or other agencies, in securing their repatriation orreturn; and such technical services as may be necessary if or these purposes.(3) Rehabilitation supplies and services: materials (such as seeds, ferti-lizers, raw materials, fishing equipment, machinery and spare parts) needed to enable a recipient country to produce and transport relief supplies forits own and other liberated areas, and such technical services as may benecessary for these purposes.(4) Rehabilitation of public utilities and services: so far as they can be repaired or restored to meet immediate needs: such as light, water, sanita-tion, power, transport, temporary storage, communications, and assistancein procuring material equipment for the rehabilitation of educationalinstitutions.
ttt RELATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION WITH EXISTING INTER- frVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES AND AGENCIES established to . DEAL WITH SUPPLIES, SHIPPING AND RELATEDQUESTIONS.i The. activities of the Administration in bringing assistance to the victimsf war will be so conducted that they do not impede the effective prosecution of the war. The prosecution of the war demands that scarce supplies and shipping tonnage, shall be carefully controlled and allocated in order to assure not only that the supplies and shipping requirements of the armed forces are fully met, but also that a fair distribution of supplies is made between the civil populations of the various areas having due regard totheir actual or potential contribution to the war effort. It will thereforew &apos;-&apos;essential, both for the conduct of the war and in order to promote a fairdisiubution of supplies between the inhabitants of areas with which theAdministration -is concerned and those of other areas, that demands uponsupplies and shipping presented by the Administration should be co-co-ordinated with other demands through ithe use of the existing inter-goyernmeht!alagencies concerned with the allocation of supplies- and shipping.2. It will be an essential part of the functions of the Administration tosecure a fair distribution of goods which are in short supply and of shipping services to&apos; arid &apos; among the various areas liberated or to be liberated. Forthis purpose the Administration must have full knowledge of all the relief and rehabilitation import requirements of such areas, whatever arrange-ments may be contemplated for procurement or finance. Therefore, member governments. shall keep the Administration fully informed of their require-ments and programs of intended purchases. The Director General maypresent, to the inter-governmental allocating agencies such recommendationsor objections as he may deem necessary to obtain a fair distribution toand among both liberated and to be liberated areas. The Director general will present before the inter-governmental allocating agencies the overallrequirements for relief and rehabilitation of all areas liberated .and to beliberated in order to permit a global consideration of these needs with allother needs. He may also present the particular requirements of any countryfor which the assistance of the Administration has been requested. It is anti-cipated that the Director General, and, where necessary, the Chairman of theCommittee on Supplies, will be fully consulted by the inter-governmentalallocating agencies when any matter touching the interests of the Administra-I tion is under discussion. - ,      -3. In order that the supplies allocated by the appropriate intergovernmental; agency against requirements presented and supported by the Administration\ may be procured expeditiously and without duplication of effort, the Director&apos; General, after consultation, where   necessary, with the appropriate inter-governmental agency, will make use wherever possible of the establishednational agencies concerned with the procurement, handling, storage andtransport of supplies.   The member governments to which such, nationalagencies are responsible would agree on their part to put the services of suchagencies at the disposal of the Administration.   Such additional responsibilities would form part of those already-undertaken in prosecuting the war effort ofthe United Nations.31857   - A 4
IV.   RELATIONSHIP OF THE ADMINISTRATION WITH THE&apos;  MILITARY COMMANDi. Before an area is liberated, the Administration will, when requested bythe military authorities,[a] consult with them in the planning of supplies for the relief and rehabilitation of the area during the period of military control;(&amp;) arrange for the advance procurement of such supplies as may beagreed on to supplement supplies to be provided by the military authorities.2.

It is recommended to member governments that the transition in each area from military to civilian relief and rehabilitation operations be consume-mated at the earliest date that military considerations permit.RESOLUTION No. 2A Resolution relating to non-discriminationResolved,1. That, in any area where relief and rehabilitation operations are being conducted through the employment, in whole or in part, of the Adminis-tration&apos;s resources, relief and rehabilitation in all its aspects shall be distributedor dispensed fairly on the basis of the relative needs of the population in thearea, and without discrimination because of race, creed or political belief.2. That, in determining the relative needs of the population, there maybetaken into account the diverse needs caused by discriminatory treatment bythe enemy during its occupation of the area.RESOLUTION No. 3A Resolution relating to assistance from member governmentsResolved,That the Council recommends that member governments take such steps as may be necessary and feasible to facilitate any operations of the Adminis-cration within areas under their control, assisting the Administration in

That the Council invite representatives of the League of Nations Tech-nical Organizations,, the International Labor Organization, the Tntergovern-mental Committee on Refugees, and the United Nations Interim Commissionon Food and Agriculture (or representatives from the Permanent Organizationfor Food and Agriculture how represented by the Interim Commission), toattend as observers and to participate in the meetings of the Council, its com-mittees, and subcommittees, and in the meetings of regional committees andtechnical standing committees,, in accordance with appropriate provisions inthe Permanent Rules of Procedure.3.

That the Director General, in pursuance of the principle set forth inparagraph 1 above, co-operate to such a degree and to such extent as he may deem desirable in the interests of the Administration&apos; with all other inter-governmental agencies whose operations and specialized services maybe of value to the Administration, including the sending of his representatives asobservers to the meetings of other intergovernmental agencies, as&apos;well as those mentioned in paragraph 2 above.RESOLUTION No. 6 .   &apos;!   &quot;A Resolution relating to collaboration&apos;with regard to economic measuresResolved,That the Council recommends that member governments consult with theDirector Generalrwith a view to avoiding, so far as possible, the subjectionof the funds; supplies, equipment and services of the Administration to continue measures which might diminish the effectiveness of such- activitiesor impose financial burdens on the Administration. otii -.
PART II.-RELIEF AND REHABILITATION POLICIESRESOLUTION No. 7A Resolution relating to relief distribution policies:Resolved,That the Council approves the following statement as a guide to activitieswith respect to relief and rehabilitation distribution:  (1) That at no time shall relief and rehabilitation supplies be used as apolitical weapon, and no discrimination shall be made in the distributionof relief supplies because of race, creed or political belief.(2) That in general the responsibility for the distribution, within an area, of relief and rehabilitation supplies should be borne by the govern-ment or recognized national authority which exercises administn );eauthority in the area.(3) That distribution should be so conducted that all classes of thepopulation, irrespective of their purchasing power,, shall receive theirequitable shares of essential commodities. When supplies are sold to con-sumers, prices should be set at such levels as to facilitate the . flow ofsupplies into the proper hands, and to avoid maladjustments in the pricestructure of the areas.(4) That distribution of relief and rehabilitation supplies should take place under effective rationing and price controls. The suppression of blackmarkets should not be left to general pronouncements and decrees, but should be the subject of active measures of enforcement applied vigorouslyand unremittingly.(5) That the government or recognized national authority which exercisesadministrative authority in the area should take appropriate measures to insure that insofar as the distribution within a liberated territory of relief and rehabilitation goods is done through private trade, the remunerationearned by private traders for their services is no more than is fair and reasonable.(6) That use should be made to the maximum practicable extent of normal agencies of distribution (governmental, commercial, co-operative),to the particular ends of combatting inflation and restoring normaleconomic activity. This principle, however, cannot be pursued at theexpense of measures found necessary under emergency conditions to insurean adequate control of the distribution of supplies and their direction tothe appropriate consumers.(7) That if the Administration is called on by the military authority tofurnish distribution services through its own organization and personnel in a liberated territory in which a government or recognized nationalauthority does not yet exercise administrative authority, the administration should, subject to the general provisions governing the relation of theAdministration to the military authority and the government or recognizednational authority concerned, make the fullest possible use of localauthorities and of local organizations. .   .(8) That the Administration be prepared to render direct assistance in distribution whenever, because of unusual circumstances the. government or recognized national authority concerned requests such aid within its territory. Wherever as a consequence of such request, the administration is directly concerned with internal distribution, it should follow, in co-operation with the national or local authorities, the same general principlesas those recommended above.
XT(a) That the Director General should be kept fully informed concerningthe distribution of relief and rehabilitation supplies within any recipientareas,, and under all circumstances there should be the fullest working co-operation between the governments or recognized national authorities concerned and the Administration for this purpose.RESOLUTION No. 8A Resolution relating to health and medical careResolved,i That the Council urge its members, when nominating alternates for membership of the standing technical Committee on Health, to designate assuch alternates accredited and technically competent representatives of theirrespective national health services.\ 2.

That the Council recommends that governments and recognized nationalauthorities, whenever so requested by the Administration, offer all facilities in making available to the Administration suitable personnel for its health&apos;&quot;organization, including the temporary loan of  technical experts,   and  theservices of scientific institutions.4. That the Council recommends the closest collaboration at the earliestpossible time between the Administration and the Allied Military Authorities,particularly in relation to the notification of infectious diseases, within thelimits of military security, and to the orderly^transfer to the Administrationof the epidemic control and other public health measures put into operation by the military authorities.5. That the Council recommends that governments and recognized nationalauthorities whenever so requested by the Administration, facilitate in everyway possible the assignment of their nationals from the occupied countries for technical training especially in the newer aspects of medical and sanitarysciences in the countries where such training is available; under the con-dition that the request be filed by the government concerned.RESOLUTION No. 9A Resolution relating to welfare services and voluntary relief agenciesResolved,1. That welfare services administered by or in co-operation with theAdministration shall be provided without discrimination because of race,creed or political belief.2. That it shall be the policy of the Administration to enlist the co-opera-tion and seek the participation of appropriate foreign voluntary relief agencies,to the extent that they can be effectively utilized in relief activities for whichthey have special competence and resources, subject to the consent and regulation of the Director General in accordance with Article IV, paragraph 2of the Agreement.3. That the extent to which foreign voluntary relief agencies should be usedfor assistance in the relief and rehabilitation of distressed people in any country should be a matter to be determined by the Director General in con-sultation with the government or recognized national authority concerned.
4. That within the framework of its total program and with the closestcollaboration between the health, welfare and other appropriate organizationunits, the Administration should make specific provision for welfare services for victims of war in particular for children, expectant and nursing mothers,the aged and the disabled.5. That in general, welfare services should be administered, as far aspossible, by the government or recognized national authority concerned andthe Administration should make its resources available to the appropriatenational governmental agency in accordance with plans agreed upon betweenthe &quot;Administration and the national agency.Continuous co-operation should be maintained and information exchanged between the government or recognized national authority concerned and theAdministration. ......6. That the Administration should be prepared to administer welfare &amp;3vices directly, either in part or in whole, when called upon by a government or recognized national authority, which for any reason is unable itself to administer these services.7. That because of already prolonged suffering due to war and becauseof critical needs, the Administration should arrange to provide, as promptlyas possible, the necessary welfare services, to be available when countries^are liberated or occupied by the United Nations.8. That welfare services should be designed to help people to help them-selves. Wherever possible constructive work opportunities and measures for self-help should be provided to permit those receiving relief to produce atleast some of their own basic requirements.9. That because of the magnitude and complexity of the welfare problemsconfronting the Administration, and the necessity for effective technicalguidance, there should be established a standing technical Committee on welfare.RESOLUTION No. 10A Resolution relating to policies with respect to displaced personsResolved,1. That the Council recommends that member governments and theDirector General exchange information on all phases of the problem, includ-ing such matters as the numbers and places of temporary residence of their nationals in other countries, and of the presence of the nationals of othercountries, or stateless persons., within their territories;2.

That the Council recommends that member governments consult withthe Director General for the purpose of carrying out measures with respectto the repatriation or return of displaced persons; and that the classes ofpersons to be repatriated be those referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 of thereport of Sub-committee 4 of Committee IV.4. That the question of the assistance to be given by the administration in the return to their homes of displaced persons of enemy or ex-enerhynationality who have been intruded into homes from which nationals of theUnited Nations have been expelled should be considered as a separate issue to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 11 and 12of tie report of Sub-Committee 4 of Committee IV;
c. That steps be taken to ensure the closest co-operation with the Com-mittee on Health, as well as with the national health, authorities of thevarious countries concerned, with a view to preventing and controlling anyepidemics which may be expected to arise in connexion with the repatriation of large groups of displaced persons;6. That the Director General take steps to ensure the closest co-operationwith such agencies as the International Red Cross and the IntergovernmentalCommittee on Refugees and any other appropriate bodies of suitable standingwhose assistance may be of value, with a view to invoking their collaboration in the work of the repatriation of displaced persons;7. That the Director General should establish the earliest possible contact with the military authorities of the United Nations with a view to concertingclans for dealing in a uniform and closely co-ordinated manner with any.rge groups of displaced persons which may be found in any liberated or occupied territory on the entry of the forces of the United Nations into that territory.RESOLUTION No. 11A Resolution relating to policies with respect to agricultural rehabilitation andother means of increasing food essential to reliefResolved,That the Council approves the following statement as a guide to activitieswith respect to agricultural rehabilitation and other methods of increasingfood essential to relief:  (1) That for the first crop year after liberation in any area the Adrninis-tration, through its agricultural rehabilitation and food production pro-gram, should give priority to the production of food for direct human consumption. For that year the war production pattern in liberated areas should generally be continued with emphasis upon maximum output both from the soil and from fisheries. In certain areas, however, modification in this policy may be undertaken where a continuance of the war productionpattern results in a disproportionate sacrifice in productivity, providedessential foods are otherwise available.(2) That it shall be the responsibility of the Administration to assist govern-ments and recognized national authorities in the liberated areas immediately to take the necessary steps in providing the supplies and services needed to enable farmers to sow and harvest essential crops during the first cropyear, to maintain their dairy herds, and to rehabilitate- their farms forimmediate food production. It shall also be the responsibility of theAdministration to assist in restoring necessary processing facilities; in pro-viding for the early expansion of fisheries and of the whaling industry;in reinstating the agricultural labour needed to carry out the productionprogram; and, to the extent that they can contribute to the solution of relief problems, in re-establishing experimental stations and essential agri-cultural institutions, organizations and services, in making the necessarytechnical surveys to determine agricultural requirements and to lay the basis for production programs.(3) That it shall be the policy of the Administration to integrate to&quot;thefullest possible extent its short-run agricultural rehabilitation and food pro-duction efforts with the longer-run reconstruction objectives of the united nations Organization for Food and Agriculture, and to shape its policiesso as not to hamper the achievement of those objectives, which, call for the progressive realization in all countries of diets adequate both in quantity and quality.
(4) That since priorities between various agricultural items will vary from area to area, such priorities shall be determined by the government orrecognized national authority concerned in conjunction with the director general in accordance with the general policy outlined above. In deter-mining such priority for agriculture and fishing requirements the test shouldbe applied whether the supply of these requirements will bring early and large returns in the form of crops and fish for direct human consumption.(5) The Administration should be prepared when requested by a govern-ment or recognized national authority to assist them in making technicalfield surveys in establishing priority on the need for supplies in making available information concerning production surpluses in nearby areas, andin providing such other technical assistance as is required.RESOLUTION No. 12 \ (&quot;A Resolution relating to -policies with respect to the rehabilitation of such industries, transport and other services as are essential to reliefWhereas,The preamble of the Agreement states that preparations and arrangementsshall be made for assistance in the resumption of urgently needed industrial production and the restoration of essential services, it is therefore  resolved,That, subject to the provisions of Resolutions Nos. 1 and 17 of this session, the Council approves the following statement as a guide to activitieswith respect to the rehabilitation of such industries, transport and other services as are essential to relief.1. Rehabilitation supplies are to consist of materials, such as raw materials,machinery and spare parts needed to enable a recipient country to produce and transport relief supplies for its own and other liberated territories; and,within the scope of the Administration, the rehabilitation of public utilitiesand services, so far as they can be repaired and restored to meet immediate,basic needs, such essentials as light and water, power, transportation andcommunication. These needs include rehabilitation of essential relief indus-iries, such as those which provide food, shelter, clothing, medical supplies.2. Raw materials may be supplied by (a) the liberated country in whichthe industry is situated and in which the materials. are -to be used, (6)another liberated country, or (c) any other country. The task of theAdministration in cases (a) and (b) should be the rehabilitation of the rawmaterial producing industries such as coal mines, mineral mines, constructionmaterials industries, etc. . . .3. If the raw materials required must be imported from overseas, it shouldbe the responsibility of the Administration, through the appropriate national or intergovernmental agencies, to arrange for necessary allocation and pro-procurement of supplies, so that there may be created as promptly as possible,reserves to be available at the request of the Director General when andwherever the need arises.4. It is recommended that pools be created of materials such as processingmaterials, machine tools, mobile power units, maintenance equipment, indus-trial machinery of both standard and special types, and spare parts.5. It is recommended that in cases where home production exceeds home consumption, the government or recognized national authority concerned should take all steps necessary to enable the excess of production availablein a country to be put at the disposal of other liberated areas which may needsuch supplies to cover their deficits.
6 It should be the policy of the Administration to help those&apos; countries whose industries can be rehabilitated for production of relief and rehabilitation&quot;oods urgently required in other liberated areas. - It is recommended that inattainment of these objectives the following be considered:, special allocations of raw materials, machinery, and spare parts, by placing at the disposal ofthose countries, at the request of their governments, an experienced staff,and by providing special priorities for the return of skilled personnel awaitingrepatriation.h It is recommended that the Governments or recognized national authori-&apos; ties having administrative authority in a liberated area will keep the; director general and the appropriate regional committee fully informed as to any surplus of supplies from time to- time available in such area, to meet/ whencircumstances permit, relief and rehabilitation import requirements of otherberated areas.8. It is recommended that the Administration should, in consultation withthe governments or recognized national authorities concerned and the appro-priate international co-ordinating authority, assist liberated areas in restoring the transport and communications system to satisfactory working, condition;it should also help to restore equipment, repair shops, work shops, shipyards,etc. It is recommended that a pool of transportation equipment both fixedand mobile should be created either from stocks manufactured overseas orin Allied or in neutral countries. Equipment which has been the property ofthe enemy may also form part of the pool.9. It should be the task of the Administration to participate in conjunctionwith military and other appropriate authorities in the organization andco-ordination of the transportation of relief and rehabilitation supplies duringthe relief and rehabilitation period. v-jbs,10. It is recommended that the requirements for raw materials, machinery,spare, parts and. processing materials should be established within each countryand .that a definite order of priority be established taking into consideration:(a) technical factors,., such as,&apos; on the one hand, the public services (gas,water, electricity), and, on the other, the necessity of restoring the needs- ofvarious types of consumer goods; (6) social factors such as the necessityof providing re-employment; (c) temporary economic factors such as scarcity of certain raw materials and shipping.ii.. The task of rehabilitation must not be considered as the beginning of reconstruction it is coterminous with relief. No new construction or recbn-struction work is contemplated, but only rehabilitation as defined in the preamble of the Agreement. Problems, such as unemployment, are important,but not determining factors. They are consequences and, at the same time,motives of action. The Administration cannot be called upon to help restorecontinuous employment in the world. &apos;RESOLUTION No. 13A Resolution relating to policies with respect to shelterResolved,       -V   - - &apos;    -&apos;..&apos;That:the Council approves the following statement as a guide to activitieswith respect to shelter:  * -&apos;&apos;&apos;:(1) That any general rebuilding policy for the areas to be liberated is inthe sphere of long-term reconstruction and does not, therefore, come withinthe purview of the Administration.
(2) That in the relief period- priority in the rehabilitation of essentialshelter or accommodation in the liberated areas should be given to:Hospitals and schools.Habitations for homeless persons, especially for workers engagedin essential public services and in industries having high priority inrelief, as well as for farmers and agricultural workers.(3) That where it may be necessary, however, there should be importedconstruction tools such as hand tools, building supplies and equipment,including excavating machinery, should essential materials and equipmentnot be found available, or be in short supply.(4) As regards the problem of shelter for displaced persons, which fallsinto two parts-temporary. accommodation at collecting points and atfrontiers, and accommodation of a more permanent, though not necessariifinal character, for persons who cannot be returned to their homes either because their homes have been destroyed or because these are in territoriesstill occupied by the enemy wherever possible existing buildings, camps,barracks, hospitals and other public buildings, should&apos; be used as they areor can be made suitable.(5). That where, in some enemy-occupied territories, extensive enemycoloniza-tion has taken place, and where consolidation of holdings and construction of military installations has been accompanied by destructionof farmhouses and buildings, there should be provided camp accommodationsfor farmers and agricultural workers upon return to their own country. any large-scale permanent reconstruction of holdings and the rebuilding of farm-houses and other structures should not be undertaken by the Adminis-tration. Pools of building materials shall he promptly created so thatadvance arrangements can be made for the accommodation of farmers and agricultural workers.(6) Where prefabricated housing is a specialized industry in any of the territories of a member government, the importance of making these supplies available as a part of the contribution of these governments should berecognized. .&quot; (7) That where there is widespread destruction of particular areas causedby military operations or of a deliberate &quot; scorched earth &quot; policy on thepart of the enemy, although priority should be given to housing repairs asindicated in paragraph 2, accommodation or shelter for workers in thefofid processing industries should be provided.(8) That it is of importance that arrangements should be made, with theconsent of the government concerned, for an expert assessment of thisdamage, so that detailed and accurate specifications of the equipment required in the reconstruction of factories, providing essential relief require-ments and the shelter or accommodations for the workers engaged in those industries may be obtained at as early a date as possible. In order thatthis work may be started, if possible, during the period of military responsi-bility for civilian relief and rehabilitation, the Council, recommends to itsmember governments that the military authorities be invited to advise theAdministration, to the fullest extent consistent with military security, of conditions found in the area affecting civilian relief and rehabilitationrequirements and supplies.

The Director General may present to the inter-governmental allocatingagencies the particular requirements of any country for which the assistanceof the Administration has been requested.2. In cases where requirements or programs of intended purchases are presented directly to the inter-governmental allocating agencies by thegovernment of a country liberated or to-be-liberated, such government, inadvance of their presentation, shall keep the Director General fully informed of such requirements or programs. The Director General may present tothese agencies such recommendations or objections in respect of these requirements or programs as he may deem necessary to obtain a fair distri-bution of relief and rehabilitation supplies to and among the various areasliberated or to-be-liberated.3. In determining what requirements he should present to the inter-governmental allocating agencies in respect of countries for which theassistance of the Administration has been requested, and what recom-mendations or objections he should make in respect of requirements pre-sented by member governments directly to such agencies in order to obtain a fair distribution of relief and rehabilitation supplies, as provided in para-graphs 1 and 2. immediately preceding, the Director General shall pay due regard to the degree of urgency of particular relief and rehabilitationrequirements and to the extent of damage suffered by member governments in a part or the whole of their respective areas as a result of hostilities orof occupation by the enemy.

By consultation with the government concerned,or otherwise, every effort will be made to prevent any dislocation of the economy of a supplying country resulting from procurement by or 0behalf of the Administration.2. The Director General will consider it one of his first and most importanttasks to seek, through the appropriate national and inter-governmentalagencies, to arrange for necessary allocations and procurement of supplies and their storage, shipping and handling, so that there shall be created aspromptly as possible balanced reserves which shall be available at the requestof the Director General whenever and wherever the need arises.3. Member governments having administrative authority in a liberatedarea will keep the Director General and the appropriate regional committeefully informed as to any surplus of supplies from time to time available insuch area, to meet, when circumstances permit, relief and rehabilitationimport requirements of other liberated areas.4. The Director General will consult with the military command or otherestablished control authorities responsible for enemy or ex-enemy terri-tories, with a view to securing information as to any surplus of supplies from time to time available in such enemy or ex-enemy territories, fromwhich relief and rehabilitation import requirements of liberated areas mightbe met.B.

COMMITTEE 1(Reception No.. 322)Report of the Committee on Organization and AdministrationChairman:  Paul-Henri Spaak (Belgium).yice-Chairman:  Juan Chavez (Peru).Rapporteur:  Brooke Claxtpn (Canada).Secretary:  Huntirigton Gilchrist.-Assistant. Secretary: Allen T. Bonnell.The Committee on Organization and Administration, having met and hav-mg considered the reports  of   its four  sub-committees,   recommends theadoption by the Council of the resolutions appended hereto on the following subjects:   1I. Regional Committees of the Council.1. Composition of the Committee of the Council for Europe (resolution no. .18).2. Composition of the Committee of the Council for the Far East (Resolu-tion No. 19).3, Functions of the Committees of the Council for Europe and the far east (Resolution No. 20).II. Standing Technical Committees of the Council.is Creation and Composition of Standing Technical Committees (Resolu-tion No. 26).In the resolution appended hereto the Committee points out that aseach member government may name a representative on each.. of thetechnical committees it is likely that membership on these committees willbe large and may not always be confined to technicians. The committee therefore deems it important to emphasize to the Council the desirabilityof firmly establishing the principle that the standing, technical committeesand sub-committees should be relatively small groups of experts, selectedsolely for their special competence and familiarity with the questions withwhich they are to deal.2. Functions of the Committee on Agriculture (Resolution No. 27).3. Functions of the Committee on Displaced Persons (Resolution No. 28).4. Functions of the Committee on Health (Resolution No. 29).5. Functions of the Committee on Industrial Rehabilitation (resolution no. 30).6. Functions of the Committee on Welfare (Resolution No. 31).III. Facilities and Immunities for the Administration, its Council and Com-mittee Members and its Staff.1. Facilities and Immunities for the Administration, its Council and Com-mittee Members and its Staff (Resolution No. 32).2.. Official Correspondence of the Administration (Resolution No. 34).3. Travel Facilities for the Staff of the Administration (Resolution No. 36).In Section II of each of the last three resolutions, the Council requeststhe Director General to initiate immediately negotiations with member governments to bring the arrangements mentioned in the resolution intooperation as rapidly as possible. The Committee hopes that the member governments will carry on these negotiations on their side speedily andtiiat no member government will withhold these immunities and facilities
o-commanding favourable action by other governments. It is important, in theopinion of the Committee, that the member governments act in thesematters as quickly as their executive and legislative procedures permit.IV Rules of Procedure of the Council and its Standing Committees.The Committee recommends to the Council that it adopt the resolution which follows, bringing into force the Rules of Procedure of the Council and annex I thereto, being the Rules of Standing Committees of the Council(Resolution No. 40). &apos;With reference to Article XI of the proposed Rules of Procedure of theCouncil, the representative of the French Committee of National Liberationstated that he accepted in principle the use of English as the official language of the Council and its committees in view of the exclusively economic andr hnical character of the problems with which the Council has to deal,it being clearly understood, however, that he did not renounce in any waythe right to claim for French its traditional role as the official language inthe discussion and formulation of international documents of a diplomaticcharacter. The representatives of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Nether-lands associated themselves with this statement of the representative of theFrench Committee of National Liberation.The Committee points out that in accordance with Article XI, Section 2,of the Temporary Rules of Procedure of the Council, the attached rules,which are designed to be permanent, will, as soon as adopted by the Council,replace the temporary rules.V. Personnel Policies of the AdministrationWith regard to personnel policies of the Administration the Committee,after examining the subject, has arrived at the following conclusions andrecommendations:  (1) The Council&apos;s function with respect to the problem of personnel isto formulate a broad general policy which will result in the employmentof a staff of highly competent officers and employees who are truly inter-national civil servants. It is recognized that the executive authority and responsibility are vested, under the Agreement, in the Director General.Consequently, it is necessary that he act with the greatest possible liberty in personnel matters so that he may speedily establish an efficient and adequateadministrative force, composed of persons who are selected oh the basis oftheir individual competence, integrity and technical skill.(2) In order to attain a staff of truly international character it is recom-mended that recruitment should be upon as wide a geographic basis aspossible, compatible with effective and efficient administration. It wasagreed that it would be a wise policy for the Director General, in recruitingemployees, to ascertain in advance if any condition of circumstance existedwith respect to a candidate which might minimize the utility of such candi-date to the Administration. It was further agreed, however, that theDirector. General must have the widest possible liberty in determining the/relationship between the Administration and Member Governments in the, recruitment of their Nationals.(3) The Committee recommends that, member governments assist theDirector General in securing a properly qualified, staff by making availableto the Administration such persons in their own civil service as the director general may invite to join the staff of the Administration. In such cases,proper steps should be taken by the Member Government: to safeguardsuch persons from any loss in established status or rights by reason of theirtemporary transfer to the service of the Administration.. It was felt thatthe adoption of a similar policy by international agencies would be of great
aid to the Director General and promote the development of commonpolicies and a stronger international civil service.(4) It was recognized that the wholly temporary character of the Admiuis-&apos; tration presents a very special personnel problem.   Salary standards mustbe established at a sufficiently high level to make it possible for the Adminis-; tration to secure the services of persons possessing the highest degree ofcompetence in their respective fields of work. On the other hand, it was felt that the most&apos; careful scrutiny must be given by: the Director general to the special problem which will arise because of the varying&apos; salary- standards prevailing in the different parts- of the world irt which theAdministration will operate; and that every precaution must be exercised by him to avoid inequities and eliminate friction because of these varyingstandards.(5) Recognizing that the scope and complexity of the work which &apos;\Administration is undertaking will require the services of persons possessinga wide variety of skills and technical knowledge, your subcommittee feels-that it may, in some instances, he essential for the Administration to providespecial training for its personnel.   It was agreed that the fullest utilization. should be made by the Administration of the men and women now serving in the Armed Forces of the United Nations, and who, at the close of thewar, will constitute a vast reservoir of manpower&apos; capable&apos;1 of making an extremely valuable contribution to the work of the Administration. ,In order to make effective these conclusions, the, Committee recommendsthe adoption by the Council of the following resolution: (Resolution No. 37),VI. Regulations with Respect to Expenditures and Receipts of the Adminis-.-.;    tration,   Administrative   Budget   and   Allocation   of   Administrative-  Expenses Ji;       &apos; 1   .  &quot;&apos;  .1. Regulations  with   Respect   to   Expenditures   and . Receipts  of  theAdministration.........The Committee recommends the adoption of the following resolutionconcerning the attached regulations with respect to expenditures and receipts of the Administration (Resolution No. 41). Regulations in thefinancial field are also included in the Financial Plan approved by committee III. It is recommended that the report of that committee be studied and co-ordinated as far as necessary with the report of thisCommittee. -2. Administrative Budget and Allocation of Administrative Expenses.The Committee, having considered the estimate of administrative ex-penses for the year 1944 and for the unelapsed part of the- year 1943,submitted by the Director-General as required by Article VI of the Agree-ment (Appendix XV), recommends the adoption by the Council of. theresolution set forth,below (Resolution No. 38). - .The Committee believes that it is essential for the purposes&quot; of Article vi of the Agreement and of the efficient operation of the Administration thata&apos; method of allocating administrative expenses among all member goyern-ments should be agreed by the present Council. &apos;&apos; In the time&quot;available,,however, it did not appear possible to the Committee to&apos; suggest a schedule of allocations that could be confidently taken as finally the most appropriate.Consequently, the Committee&apos; proposes&apos;: that the allocation to. be made atthis session of the Council, a&apos;s set forth in the &quot;following resolution, shouldbe regarded as provisional, in that it should be reviewed by the appropriateCommittee of the CounciTbefore a final determination is made by the&apos; council for future years. In framing this schedule&apos; the Committee has&apos; soughtguidance from existing schedules of allocations &apos; used by other international bodies. It has recognized, however, that it would not be appropriate forthe Administration to&apos; adopt the principle which obtains on many such bodies of limiting the maximum allocation so that no state pays more than a com-

It has further had in mind thedesirability of a clear and simple schedule, and it has paid regard to thefact that the niain object of the Administration is the provision of relief supplies and services, and that it would be undesirable to adopt a schedule of administrative expenses which would allocate an unduly large proportionof any government&apos;s general contribution to administrative&apos;expenses. Atthe same time the Committee has been anxious to meet the expressed desire of the governments of liberated areas to contribute substantially to theadministrative expenses. In accordance with the regulations with respectto expenditures and receipts of the Administration, a member governmentmay treat its share of the administrative expenses as included in its. generalcontribution for participation in the work of the Administration.APPENDIX XV TO REPORT OF COMMITTEE IMessage of the Director General Submitting the Administrative budget for the Fiscal Year 1944 and the Unelapsed Part of the Year 1943Estimate by the Director General of Administrative Expenditures and Receipts,; , and an Explanation and Justification of the EstimatesTo:&apos;  The Council.&quot;The Ad Hoc Sub-committee on the Administrative Budget.As required by Article VI of the United Nations Relief and rehabilitation administration Agreement and the appropriate regulations, I am submitting to the Council my estimates of the administrative expenses and receipts forthe year 1944 and the unelapsed part of the year 1943. By Council action,the Ad Hoc Sub-committee on the Administrative Budget is the appropriate body of the Council to receive and consider these estimates. The Expendi-tures and Receipts are each estimated, for the period ending December 31st,1944, at $10,000,000.The estimate of $10,000,000 required for administrative expenditures is sub-divided as follows:   &quot;,   . &apos;    %For salaries and other Personal Services:For headquarters, regional offices, committee staffs,  and. other activities except field missions ...      ...      ....   ...     4,800,000For field missions     1 .........    4,000,000
The Council will not have supposed that I should be able, at this time topresent a budget based upon a definite pattern of organization, nor would it have desired me to do so. Even in respect to the administrative organization(as distinguished from field missions), it is evident that the pattern of organiza-tion must wait upon the completion of the work of this first session of theCouncil, and then upon the analysis of the activities to be undertaken by theDirector General, the regional.offices and various committees, and upon dis-cussion of the most efficient organization with representative members of theCouncil and others. While I expect to begin assembly of a staff immediately,I shall not determine the final form of the administrative organization until Ishall have had time fully to analyze all the actions of the first session of theCouncil.From an examination of the tasks which must be undertaken by that part of the administrative organization which is responsible for executive activities/,,for programming, for arrangements for procurement and for accounting, audit,services as secretariat to the Council, and for ail the other non-field services which are required for an organization of this kind, it is evident that withinthe next few months a substantial number of employees will be required.Some of these employees will be in Washington, some in a European office,some in a Far Eastern office and some in other places, such as for example,Cairo. I cannot yet determine the relative needs of such offices. Because ofthe size of the task which lies ahead of the Administration, the urgency of itsmission, and the fact that in substantial measure its work will be that ofco-ordination, it must secure the most competent employees possible, and itwill be necessary to pay them adequate salaries related to this high degree ofcompetence.. I estimate that the cost of compensation for these employees onan annual basis will amount to approximately $4,800,000. .For the field missions to be established during the year 1944 it will likewisebe necessary to attract persons of outstanding ability and pay them com-mensurately. It is obvious that no definite forecast of the number of missions,or their size, or the time- when they will commence to operate is possible atthe present time. I have assumed that the missions would vary greatly in size, ranging from perhaps not more than ten persons in areas where an existing government is prepared to assume all administration of relief and rehabilitation, to as many as 250 persons in areas where the governmentdesires more assistance in the organization of relief and rehabilitationactivities during a period of disorganization following reoccupation of theterritory. I am aware of the desire of some governments for technical personnel in considerably larger numbers than those mentioned, and I shalldo my utmost to be of the greatest possible assistance in. that connection.But I believe that where such technical personnel is furnished to, the govern-ment of a liberated area to engage directly in relief and rehabilitation activitiesas distinguished from administrative supervision the charge for salaries isproperly an operating expenditure, and not to be.charged to the administrativebudget. The figures given, therefore, are not to be read as an indication thatsuch technical personnel will not be made available. That question remainsfor future decision in the light of circumstances as they develop, and the requests and needs of the different governments.For the field mission employees, I believe that an estimate of $4,000,000 forsalaries and personal service is a reasonable figure. Although I can make no final commitment, I would expect that UNRRA employment, apart from field missions, is unlikely to increase after 1944. On the other hand, at the peak of operation the staffs of the field missions may well be much larger thanthe number needed in 1944.   Exactly how much larger no one can tell.
In addition to salaries ifor personnel, there must necessarily, be very aub-tantial items of expenditure. Those persons who are assigned to work farfrom their homes and away from their families must in many cases be givenah added allowance to compensate them for the extra cost of maintaining theirregular homes and maintaining themselves in a foreign post, sometimes&apos; underexpensive conditions. This is a recognized practice of government. The; costof travel will undoubtedly be heavy because of the vast distances over which,the Administration must operate. The cost of communications, will likewise; be heavy because of the need for constant interchange of cabled information.The estimate of expenditures for supplies and equipment, for other con-contractual services and for general expense is based upon normal government&apos;experience. For these items I have estimated a total expenditure of$3,000,000 until the end of 1944. In fixing this sum I have taken a very&apos;/T-nservative figure, in light of the expenditures of United States publicAgencies engaged in similar activities, but I believe that a determined effortat economy will make it possible to keep within the figure.The total personal and other than personal service estimate is $11,800,000.This figure is on an annual basis, assuming full service of all personnel for a full year. It is obvious that the total personnel will not be employed for the full year. Even as to the selection of the administrative personnel, it will take time to find the right people for the right places, and a certain amount of theannual salary will remain unspent because some individuals will not go onthe payroll until well after January first. In respect to the field missions, therewill be a larger difference between full annual salaries and actual expendituresbecause many of the missions will not commence to operate until well into theyear. 1944.Similarly, because the Administration will not be engaged in its full scopeof activity in its early months of existence, expenses for other than personal services will be less than would be required for full operation for the entireyear. I estimate that on an overall basis, 30 per cent, of the estimated fullannual amount will remain unspent, and I have, therefore, deducted fromthe estimate the amount of $3,540,000, leaving a net of $8,260,000 as theestimate of the total planned expenditures.But it will also be evident to the members of the Council that in an operationof this character, there must be provision to meet very substantial expendituresfor activities the exact nature, location and time of which we cannot nowforesee, but which are bound to develop. Indeed, throughout the life ofthe Administration I anticipate that we shall meet constantly the unexpected,and we must always make adequate provision for it. Obviously, it isimpossible to make any accurate estimate of the amount which should be reserved for those unplanned activities but, in order to have a sufficient pro*vision, I have requested this provision in the amount of $1,740,000 to beavailable to the Director General to meet contingencies as they arise. If theamount is not needed, it will not be spent. If it is needed, the need will beurgent and the money must be available.  .Accordingly, the total amount of the budget, approval of which is requested by the Council for the year 1944 and for the unelapsed part of the year 1943,is; $10,000,000.Estimate of ReceiptsUnder Article VI of the Agreement provision is made that:_&quot; Upon approval of a budget by the Council the total amount approvedshall be allocated: to the member governments in proportions to be deter-mined by the Council.   Each member government undertakes, subjectJL IL/&apos; ij
to the requirements of its constitutional procedure, to contribute to theAdministration promptly its share of the administrative expenses so determined.&quot;The subcommittee on the administrative budget has proposed an allocation of administrative expenses among the 44 member nations of the Adminis-tration. The financial plan approved by the Subcommittee on Finance pro-vides that the share of administrative expenses allocated to each member government may be included by the governmetn in its general contributions for participation in the work of the Administration. Under the allocationsapproved by the Subcommittee on the Administrative Budget, the smallestcontribution from any member government will be $5,000, and the largestcontribution will be $4,000,000, if the Council shall approve my request fora $10,000,000 budget.I have based my estimates of receipts to meet administrative expenses uporthe assumption that every member government will contribute to UNRRaat least the amount of its allocation for administrative expenses.Form of AppropriationIn view of the lack of experience with administrative expenditures forUNRRA, it would be desirable to have the greatest possible flexibility in theuse of the appropriation voted by the Council.. Indeed I am not certain thatthe experience, during any year of the life of UNRRA will ever be a very goodguide as to what may be expected in the next. The most effective use of theadministrative appropriation will be possible if it is voted as a lump sum,subject to allocation at the discretion of the Director General in the light of circumstances as they develop. In other words, while I have indicated the amount which I presently believe will be required for salaries for adminsitrative personnel, for field personnel, for other than personal service,and for contingencies, developments may show that more is needed for onepurpose and less for another, and it would be helpful if an appropriation ofthe Council might be for a single sum of $10,000,000.Control of Administrative ExpendituresThe regulations approved by the Subcommittee on the AdministrativeBudget provide for the establishment and maintenance of accounts under thedirection of the Director General. As soon as the Council shall approve abudget; the Director General will establish the necessary accounting system and will also promulgate appropriate regulations designating the officials anddetermining the procedures under which expenditures of admin^trativefunds may be authorized or made:I am deeply conscious of the fact as head of the United Nations relief and Rehabilitation Administration, charged with the relief of human miseryand suffering throughout the world, I must make every effort to assure thewise and economical use of the Administration^ resources. I give to theCouncil my assurance that no expenditure will be made from the sum whichit may approve for administrative expenses except where such expenditure is necessary, and where it contributes to the ultimate purpose of the Adminis-tration the relief and rehabilitation of the victims of war who have sufferedso tragically from enemy plunder and exploitation.- Respectfully submitted,Herbert H. Lehman, Director General.
COMMITTEE II(Reception No. 299)Report of the Committee on General Policy       ... .&apos;Chairman: Vasili Alexseevich Sergeev (U.S.S.R.).Vice-Chairman:  Blatta Ephrem Tewelde Medhen (Ethiopia).Secretary:  Eugene Staley.Assistant Secretary: James G. Johnson.The Committee on General Policy, having been established by the council at its first session and having met and considered the reports submitted by its subcommittees, submits the following report to the Council. /*&apos; A. The Scope of the Activities of the AdministrationWith reference to the broad policies relating to the scope of the activities ofthe Administration ,the Committee recommends that the Council adopt thefollowing resolution (Resolution No. 1).B. Relations with Governments. -The Committee considered a number of problems concerning the relationsbetween the Administration and governments, and reached the following conclusions:  I. Communications with Member Governments.The Committee recognizes that prompt and efficient communication betweenthe Administration and member governments is essential to the effective dis-charge by the Director General of the responsibilities and duties placed upon him by the Agreement and by the Council. It is, therefore,- desirable thatthe Director General be given latitude with regard to the channels aridmethods to be used by him in communicating with member governments.While, in matters involving important policy or the rights or obligations of governments arising out of the Agreement, communication should be through the foreign offices of the member governments, there will be occa-sions when direct contact with technical or administrative governmental or Inter-governmental agencies will lead to the greatest efficiency of operation.Also, in certain cases, communication with or through representatives on regional or other standing committees of the Council will provide the most effective channel, particularly in the case of matters of a peculiarly regionalor technical character.It is recommended that the definition of channels and , methods of eom-munication with member governments be left to the Director General towork out in collaboration with each such government.2. Immunities and Priorities for Transit Goods. ;.. .The Committee recommends that the Council adopt the following resolu-tion (Resolution No. 33). -      -        &apos;3, Collaboration with regard to Economic Measures.....The Committee recommends that the Council adopt the following resolu-lion (Resolution No. 6).4. Assistance from Member Governments.The Committee recommends that the Council adopt the following resolu-tion (Resolution No. 3),
5&quot;.r Non-Discrimination. - -The Committee recommends that the Council adopt the following resolu-tion (Resolution No. 2).6. Administration Publicity.The Committee recommends that the Council adopt the following resolu-tion (Resolution No. 4).7. Channels of Communication with Non-Member Governments (Neutrals).The Committee, mindful of the absence of any direct reference in the Agree-ment to relations between the Administration and non-member governments(neutrals) has given consideration to the question whether or not it mightbe desirable that the Council formulate a policy with regard to procedures for communication with non-member governments (neutrals).The Committee is ol the.opinion that it would be desirable that the director general have latitude with regard to the methods and channels of communica-tion with non-member governments (neutrals). It is recommended that member governments extend to the Director General technical facilities for communicating with neutral governments, and the Committee accordinglyrecommends that the Council adopt the following resolution (resolution no. 35).8. Procedure for Admission.It is recommended that no general principle be laid down at this timefor the admission of non-member governments and that applications for admission to the Council should be considered by the Council as individualapplications are received.C. Relations with other Intergovernmental Agencies.With reference to relations between the Administration and inter-governmental agencies other than intergovernmental authorities and agenciesestablished to deal with supplies, shipping and related questions, the Gom-mittee recommends that the Council adopt the resolution set forth below(Resolution No. 6). It is&apos; the view of the Committee that, if this resolutionbe adopted, the organizations named in paragraph 2 thereof will be invited by the Director General to send observers to future sessions of the Councilwithout the necessity of further action being taken thereon by the Council.COMMITTEE IIIReport of the Committee on Finance and SuppliesChairman: Jean Monnet (French Committee of National Liberation).Vice-Chairman: Gustavo Gutierrez (Cuba).Secretary: Kenneth Dayton.Assistant Secretary: Richard Funkhouser.The Committee on Finance and Supplies, having met and considered thematters referred to it, submits the following report to the Council:_I.

Tsiang (China).Vice-Chairman: Sr. Dr. D. Juan Carlos Blanco (Uruguay).Secretary: Mr. Luther Gulick; Mr. John H. Cover, Assistant.The Committee on Relief and Rehabilitation Policies having met and con-sidered. the matters referred to it reports as. follows:  1. While other committees of the Council have been concerned , with the highly important problems of the scope, the organization, the&apos;rules, the personnel, the relations with governments, the finances, the procedures, andthe mobilization of supplies,, Committee IV has been concerned directly withthe war sufferings of men, women and children around the world, and withthe specific commodities and services which will be needed to end starvation,epidemics and suffering and to enable peoples to help themselves again, as their countries are liberated from Axis oppression and slavery.
2.&apos;The terms of reference of this Committee are set forth in the firstdozen lines of the UNRRA Agreement in the following inspiring words inwhich the United Nations express their determination: -&quot;. . . . that immediately upon, the liberation of any area by the armed forces of the United Nations or as a consequence of retreat of theenemy the population thereof shall receive aid and relief from theirsufferings, food, clothing and shelter, aid in the prevention of pesti-lence and in the recovery of the health of the people, and that pre-paration and arrangements shall be made for the return of prisoners and exiles to their homes and for assistance in the resumption ofurgently needed agricultural and industrial production and the restora-tion of essential services.&quot;3. Recognizing that relief and rehabilitation involve many technic &apos;questions of policy, Committee IV was divided into the following six sub-committees :  Subcommittee 1. Relief Distribution Policies.Subcommittee 2. Policies with Respect to Health and Medical Care. ,Subcommittee 3. Policies with Respect to Welfare Services, IncludingRelations with Voluntary Relief Agencies.Subcommittee 4. Policies  with   Respect   to   Assistance   to   displaced persons. -Subcommittee 5.

Lewis.The Subcommittee on Relief Distribution Policies, having met and con-1 dered the matters referred to it, submits the following report to Com-mittee IV:-1. In dealing with the subject of &quot; Relief Distribution Problems &quot; thesubcommittee has not attempted to furnish in advance a set of detailed rules for the guidance of the Administration in the essentially practical task ofproviding relief and rehabilitation according to the necessities of the case asthe)&apos; appear at the time. The subcommittee feels that it will better serve the interests of the Administration and of the countries receiving relief if itconfines its report to the statement of a few leading principles by which,in its opinion, the distribution of relief and rehabilitation supplies shouldbe governed, and to the expression of its opinion upon some questions ofgeneral significance in that part of the work of the Administration.2. In the course of its deliberations, however, the subcommittee invited the members. representing countries at. present occupied by the enemy tosubmit papers outlining the distribution systems existing in their countries and the nature of particular distribution problems to be anticipated afterliberation. Valuable contributions were made by the representatives fromthe following delegations: Belgium, China, Czechoslovakia, French Com-raittee, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Yugoslavia.The subcommittee desires that these documents should be regarded as partof the materials upon which its report is based. They should be referred to for the guidance they give as to particular conditions and considerations.3. A majority of countries, from the information at present available,anticipate that they will themselves be able to undertake the distributionwithin their territories of relief and rehabilitation supplies made available by or with the assistance of UNRRA. In these countries there is expectedlobe in existence, after liberation, an effective system of distribution agencies(governmental, co-operative, commercial, charitable) and the framework of rationing and price control capable of conversion into an instrument whichwill assure a fair and efficient distribution of supplies. It is the intention ofthe. Governments of these countries to do all that is possible to suppress black market activities and to remedy any existing inequitable distribution con-sequent on enemy occupation.4. In certain countries, the breakdown of the normal organization of dis-tribution is expected to be far reaching by reason, for example, of the liquidation-tion of many commercial and co-operative enterprises, the destruction of technical equipment for storage and transport and of retail shops. The forcedmigration of large sections of the population will have also disrupted, tem-temporarily at least, the network of commercial and even governmental distribu-tive organization. In these circumstances the direct assistance of the Adminis-tration may be needed-for,the. earliest possible restoration:of these facilities
and organization, and for the provision of temporary expedients to make possible the immediate resumption of distribution.5. In the opinion of the subcommittee the following are the principles towhich the distribution within the recipient areas of relief and rehabilitationsupplies should be subject and it recommends their adoption:  (i) In general the responsibility for the distribution, within an area, of relief and rehabilitation supplies should be borne by the government orrecognized national authority which exercises administrative authority inthe - area.(ii) Distribution should be so conducted that all classes of the population,irrespective of their purchasing power, shall receive their equitable shares of essential commodities. When supplies are sold to consumers, prices should be set at such levels as to facilitate the flow of supplies into tfyproper hands, and to avoid maladjustments in the price structure of theareas.(iii) Distribution of relief and rehabilitation supplies should take place under effective rationing and price controls. The suppression of blackmarkets should not be left to general pronouncements and decrees, but should be the subject of active measures of enforcement applied vigorouslyand unremittingly.(iv) The government or recognized national authority which exercisesadministrative authority in the area should take appropriate measures to insure that insofar as the distribution within a liberated territory of relief and rehabilitation goods is done through private trade, the remunerationearned by private traders for their services is no more than is fair and reasonable.(v) Use should be made to the maximum practicable extent of normalagencies of distribution, to the particular ends of combatting inflation andrestoring normal economic activity. This principle, however, cannot be pursued at the expense of measures found necessary under emergency con-ditions to ensure an adequate control of the distribution of supplies andtheir direction to the appropriate consumers.(vi) At no time should relief and rehabilitation supplies.be used as a politi-cal weapon, and no discrimination should be made in the dstribution of relief supplies because of race, creed or political belief.(vii) In view of the expectation that, in a liberated territory in which agovernment or recognized national authority does not yet exercise adminis-trative authority, the Administration may be called on by the military autho-rity to furnish distribution services through its own organization and per-sonnel, it is recommended that, subject to the general provisions governing the relation of the Administration to the military authority and the national government or recognized national authority concerned, the administration should make the fullest possible use of local, authorities and of localorganizations.(viii) The Administration must be prepared to render direct assistance in distribution whenever, because of unusual circumstances, the government concerned requests such aid within its territory. Wherever, as a conse-quence of such request, the Administration is directly concerned withinternal distribution, it should follow, in co-operation with the national or local authorities, the some general principles as those recommendedabove to member governments.(ix) The Director General, should be kept fully informed concerning thedistribution of relief and rehabilitation supplies within any recipient areas,and under all circumstances there should be the fullest working co-operationteefewoeB the Gov^rjrnanfe oa&amp;^iwd ss4- the Adnayaistr&amp;iioB for tkie propose.
COMMITTEE TV-SUBCOMMITTEE report of the Subcommittee on Policies with Respect to Health and medical CareChairman: Thomas Parran (United States of America).Vice Chairman: J. Heng Liu (China).Rapporteur: Melville Mackenzie (United Kingdom).Secretary: James A. Crahtree.The Subcommittee on Policies with respect to Health and Medical Carehaving met and considered the matters referred to it, has adopted unanimouslythe following report which it submits to Committee IV:  &apos; Scope of the health work of UNRRAi. The health work will necessarily constitute one of the primary and funda-mental responsibilities. of UNRRA. The relief and rehabilitation programmust aim towards the maximum of health security within the,practicable limits of the resources of the United Nations.2. This program would consist chiefly of the provision of assistance to governments in the rapid re-establishment of their health services generally,preventive and curative. These services include not only disease control and relief from malnutrition, but also the re-establishment of medical services,hospitals, dispensaries, sariitoria, health centres, laboratories, environmentalsanitation, maternity and child welfare services, the control of endemicdiseases, particularly tuberculosis and venereal diseases, and other essentialsfor health. For this purpose UNRRA should be prepared to give assistancein connection with equipment and supplies, personnel, expert.advice, facilitiesfor technical training-and the collection and dissemination of informationbearing on the above problems.3. One of the aims of UNRRA should be to equalize opportunity for therestoration of health in the various countries. This will involve a sharing of responsibilities and equitable distribution of goods and other assistance in proportion to need and in accordance with a coordinated plan.4. Among the most important functions of the Health Organisation of unrra will be work in connection with the control of epidemics, particularly those affecting mrore than one country.Early examination will have to be made of the best method of collecting,analysing and collating such reports regarding epidemics as may be available from any source including such information as the military may find it possibleto furnish, and subsequently distributing this information for the use of member Governments as well as UNRRA itself.Furthermore the Health Organisation will sponsor promptly the conclusionof emergency agreements among the various Governments establishinguniformity in the quarantine measures to be observed among them.In addition the Health Organisation will seek to coordinate the steps takenby countries mutually concerned in the control of outbreaks of infectious diseases. Moreover UNRRA may be called upon to provide urgently neededmedical supplies for meeting an emergency. In view of the obvious importanceof dealing rapidly with epidemics, it is essential that the Health organisation has at its immediate disposal trained personnel and material.5. The Health Organisation may be called upon to provide for the loan of experts to various countries, particularly in cases where diseases have been introduced for the first time as a result of the war, and with the control ofwhich ,neither the National Health Authority nor the local practitioners are familiar, or where diseases already endemic have reached epidemic proportions.
6. The medical aspects of nutrition will constitute one of the chief pre-occupations of the Health Organisation, and measures directed against under-nourishment and malnutrition should be carried out upon medical advice.The health organisation will be urgently concerned with the provision ofnutritional standards adequate for the maintenance of health in the terri-tories in which it operates.7. The Health Organisation in collaboration with the member governmentsconcerned will play an extremely important part in the health supervision and control of returning displaced persons. In this connection it will be important to coordinate the health measures taken in the country of departure,the countries of transit, and if the Government concerned so desires, in thecountry of destination.8. The special health needs of children and expectant and nursing mother?must be given early recognition by the Health Organisation. Prompt and adequate provision for the health and nutrition of these vulnerable groupsis essential to the restoration of normal family life and community stability.The problems of health among orphan children will be acute and must bedealt with in close collaboration with other functional units of UNRRA.Special measures will be required to. deal with communicable diseases among all children, particularly those who are homeless and lost, and those whoseresistance against disease has been lowered by malnutrition. This may wellbe intensified by over-crowding, and the lack of clothing and of other essentialsfor health and normal development.Although it may be necessary at the outset to deal with the health problemsof mothers and children through group arrangements, including maternaland child health clinics, feeding stations and other emergency, provisions, yetas soon as possible, such care should be individualized to meet the needsof each.The Health Organization should participate in the development of unrra plans for providing food for these special grounps in order thatfood policies may be maintained in consonance with their special physio-logical needs.The Health Organization may also be called upon by member govern-ments to assist in dealing with the conditions of anxiety, fear and emotionaldisturbances which will have arisen in peculiarly great frequency amongthe children and youth of occupied territories.9. A constant objective of the health program should be to demon-strate the effectiveness and need for international collaboration in publichealth. In so doing it will facilitate the later development of a permanentworld-wide health organization.Policies with respect to Governmental and Non-GovernmentalHealth OrganizationsRelationships with national health services10. It is the duty of national health services to assume full responsibilityfor. public health within their countries and UNRRA should assist in the effective prosecution of those activities directed to this end whenever this is requested, by a member government.Whenever possible the national and local health services should be thechannel through which the health work of relief and rehabilitation operations are carried out, and it should be a constant objective of the Health Organiza-tion to assist in strengthening these services.
6iCollaboration between Member Governments in the control ofepidemic diseasesii. Since diseases are not limited by political boundaries, member goyern-ments must collaborate fully in the joint adoption of measures designedcontrol the international spread of disease especially through the exchange ofepidemic intelligence so far as military security permits, joint action in con-nection with the health aspects of repatriation of displaced persons and where necessary direct collaboration between their nationl health services. Suchnecessary co-ordination and combined action could best be arranged by thecreation of a special section of the Health Organization of UNRRA for epi-demiological control.Co-operation with Governmental International Health Agencies12. Co-operation with existing Governmental international health agenciesshould be fostered. The Health Organisation of the League of Nations, theindustrial health section of the International Labour Office and the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau have much to offer on the basis of their long experience and accomplishments. In view of the importance of nutritionfrom a health point of view, co-operation should be sought with the interim commission established by the United Nations Conference on Food and agriculture, and with any permanent organisation which may succeed it.Co-operation with the International Public Health Office in Paris is, ofcourse, out of the question at the present time.Co-operation with Non-Governmental Health  Agencies13. The wide experience and goodwill of the non-governmental healthagencies should be utilised to the utmost as it is clear that the full participa-tion of all such agencies may well be needed. In accordance with the termsof the Agreement, plans and policies should be developed whereby theresources of such organisations may be used effectively in those healthaspects of relief and rehabilitation in which they have special competence.General Functions of the Health Organisation14. The general functions of the Health Organisation should include:  (a) responsibility for the health aspects of all the work of UNRRA;(b) assembling of comprehensive data on the health and medical organisa-tion of the various countries, including information on hospitals, dis-pensaries, health centres, laboratories, sanitary installations and scientificinstitutions; the numbers and kinds of local technical personnel; and thelocal production and distribution of sanitary and medical supplies;(c) collection of information on health conditions in the various terri-tories, including data on epidemic diseases, nutrition, sanitation, maternaland child health, tuberculosis and other diseases, the care of the sick and. physically handicapped, the local production and distribution of medical and sanitary supplies and all related matters;(d) overall estimation of the amounts and kinds of medical and sani-tary supplies needed, and the arrangement for their procurement, alloca-tion, transportation and distribution:(e) recruitment of technical and professional, personnel, establishment and conduct of training program, assignment of personnel to specific fields of operation, and the general direction of health operations in the field;(/) preparation, in collaboration with the respective member govern-&quot;Mncnts, of plans for health relief and rehabilitation for specific ^countries;
(g) where consistent with UNRRA policy and within the general frame-work of its field operations, temporary general administration of health services in areas where national or local health services are not yetfunctioning effectively;(h) responsibilities in connection with the health of displaced persons;(i) preparation of recommendations to the Council or to the govern-ments concerned for any emergency international agreements necessary tocontrol the spread of disease;(J) provision of experts or expert teams at the request of a national-government;(&apos;k) assistance in the&apos; control of epidemics;(7) carrying out of the general health policies of UNRRA in relationto co-operation with the health service of the appropriate inter-allied mili-tary authority; international governmental health agencies; internatioriand national non-governmental health agencies; and other Divisions of unrra engaged in activities related to the health field, especially food.  and agriculture, welfare and displaced persons.Policies regarding the Health Organisation of UNRRA15. The re-establishment of health being one of the principal objects of relief work, it is essential that the status of the Health Organisation shouldbe commensurate with its importance in the work of the whole Administration,It is a recognized principle of administration that all work of a technicalcharacter be carried out under technical direction. In view of the factthat almost every aspect of the work of UNRRA will necessarily have healthimplications (programming, supplies, personnel, training, co-operation with governments, field operations, etc.) the Director of Health must be affordeda position in the Administration which will enable him under the&apos; authorityof the Director-General to develop suitable policies and to exercise propertechnical direction over all health aspects of the work of UNRRA.16. The Health Organization should consist of a Director of Health anda technical and administrative staff, a. standing technical Committee on health of the Council which would be advisory to the Council, to the central committee, and to the Medical Director, and the necessary regional organiza-tion. Experience has shown that a. considerable degree of decentralizationis desirable in health administration, so that strong regional organizationswill be needed in areas such as Europe and the Far East.Director of Health of UNRRAiy. There should be in the Administration a health organization witha Director of. Health, who should be accorded a position in the Administra-tion, which will enable him, under the authority of the Director-General,to develop suitable policies and to exercise proper technical direction overall health aspects of UNRRA.Acting under the authority of the Director-General the Director of Healthwould be responsible for the health and medical aspects of all UNRRAactivities. He would be directly concerned in ail major policy and adminis-trative decisions in which health, medical or nutrition problems are involved.It follows that the status and success of UNRRA from the health point of-view depends on obtaining the services of a Director of Health of the highest possible professional standing, whose previous work is such as to command the respect of those qualified to judge, both from a technical and admihis-tiative -point. of -,.,vjew
Regional Health Directors18 A Regional Health Director should be appointed to each RegionalOrganization; his position should be relatively similar to that provided forthe Director of Health.Executive Health and Secretarial Staffiq. The greatest care will be required in selecting health personnel forheld work in the various countries. Technical competence is fundamental,but almost equally important is the ability to work in a team with others of a different nationality as the staff will necessarily include health personnel from a number of countries. This qualification is of primary importance for members of the staff required to work away from Headquarters, forthey must be able to understand the outlook of the people among whom they are called upon to work. In comparison with this qualification, aknowledge of languages, though a valuable asset,, is of secondary importance.During and immediately after the war it will be by no means easy tofind health personnel who possess such divergent capacities. In order toenable UNRRA to obtain promptly the necessary staff, the various member governments should facilitate the secondment or otherwise make availablehealth personnel both from central and local health authorities, includingshort term appointments.Field Missions20. The organization of health missions and the constitution of individualmissions should be the responsibility of the Director of Health or the RegionalDirectors of Health, acting under the authority of the Director-General.With&apos; regard to the field orgarization, however, it is impossible to anti-participate what types of individual or special missions may be required. member governments may well ask for highly technical assistance in almost anybranch of medical or sanitary science, particularly in view of the isolationof many of their own experts during the years of war. The Health Organiza-tion of UNRRA should, therefore, collect information regarding individualexperts and expert teams which might be made available for service in thefield should the occasion arise.Standing Technical Committee on Health21. A standing technical Committee on Health should be appointed as provided for in the Agreement. For efficient work the number of members should be limited to between 9 and 15. Chairmen of the Regional HealthSubcommittees should be included in the membership of the standingtechnical Committee on Health. As the Agreement provides that the Councilcan appoint as members of the Committee on Health alternates of specialcompetence in their respective fields of work, it is urged that members should nominate for the Committee alternates technically capable of aiding in the deliberations of the Committee, It is of the greatest importance that suchalternates as are nominated be accredited as representatives of their respec-tive Public Health Services.Regional Health Subcommittees22. Since experience has proved the desirability of a considerable degreeof decentralization in health administration, particular attention should bepaid to the setting up of strong Regional Health Organizations n^udiog
Regional Health Subcommittees. Undoubtedly the Regional Health Sub-committees, consisting of from 9 to 15 members, should be made up ofaccredited representatives of the national health administrations concerned.The importance of such representation is obvious in the case of epidemicsinvolving more, than one country for in these circumstances success in pre-venting the spread of the epidemic will involve combined action by theseveral health administrations involved.23. Both the central standing technical Committee on Health and the regional Health Subcommittees should make it a practice to invite the participation of representatives of the health services of any countries inmeetings at which important measures directly affecting such countries are discussed.Expert Commissions24. In view of the highly-technical character of the health work of UNRRAit will be essential for the standing Committee on Health and any regional health Subcommittee to have authority to appoint expert commissions. Themembers of these expert commissions should be nominated as individuals and solely on the ground of their special knowledge of the subject concerned.As members of expert commissions speak as. individuals only, there is no necessity to make any such commission even approximately representativeof a number of countries, except in so far as this may be necessary inorder to get a balanced representation of several schools of scientific thought,National and administrative views, would be represented by the standingtechnical Committee on Health and the Regional Health Subcommittees,and it is for this reason among others, that recommendations of experts orexpert commissions should invariably pass through the Committee on health or the Regional Health Subcommittee,, as the case may be, before their final acceptance.25. Among others, expert commissions on nutrition will be required which,in view of the wide differences obtaining in the food habits and nutritionalstatus between various parts of the world might be regional in character.These experts would deal with the scientific and physiological aspects of thenutrition problem and would give advice in connection with any proposedalterations in the constitution of rations, the priorities of special rationing and the classes of the population requiring special consideration, e.g., ex-pectant and nursing mothers, infants, cases of tuberculosis, deprivationdiseases, etc.26. Consideration should be given to the constitution of an expert Corn-mission dealing with the health of mothers and children which might be related to comparable groups of experts dealing with other aspects of maternaland child care.Conference of Directors of National Public Health Services27: Provision  should be made to enable the Director of Health underthe authority of the Director-General and with the approval of the Councilto summon,  either centrally or regionally,  a conference of Directors of.National Public Health Services whenever practicable and desirable.Immediate Tasks of the Health Organisation28. The tasks&apos;calling for immediate action include:-(a) Selection of a Director of Health, and the -recruitment of a competentstaff, utilizing the full resources of the United Nations so far as they canbe made available at the present time.
(6) Immediate provision of help upon request of any member governmentin order to meet emergency health problems which have actually arisen asthe result of the war.(c) Collection . and assembly of all information available on those areaslikely to be liberated first and scientific data which may be of value to the health Organisation. *(d) Conferences with appropriate Health Officials of the Member Govern-ments concerned with regard to the nature and. amount of assistance thatmay be required of UNRRA.(^Recruitment and training of personnel for field missions.(/) Study and collation of previously;prepared estimates qf health, medical and sanitation supplies, and arrangement for their scheduling and pro-procurement, with emphasis upon the importance of rapidity in forward pro-procurement particularly in respect of supplies required fOr the control ofepidemics. &apos;j . &apos;(g) Collaboration with the Allied Military Authorities for the collectionof information regarding the existing conditions in liberated areas, the prevalence of epidemics and the arrangements for the orderly transfer ofany health responsibility to UNRRA, where this is&apos; so requested by the member Government or the Military Authorities themselves(h) Training of nationals Of the various countries in special medical and.allied technical work. Whilst facilities have already been made availablein connection particularly with training in the making and fitting of artificiallimbs, training in the use of mass radiography apparatus, laboratory teeh-nical assistants, etc., yet it is felt that this service should be greatlyincreased so as to cover a. much wider scope in order ,to -provide thetechnicians who will be required for medical relief work immediately a country is liberated: for this purpose it would be desirable for some Govern-ments to assign certain of their nationals for training, and for others tooffer facilities for such training.(t) Obtaining of medical literature dealing with ;the progress of medicineand hygiene during the years of war for the liberated countries. For thispurpose the Health Organization of UNRRA should give immediate eon-sideration to the possibility of collecting selected periodicals on the various branches of medical and sanitary science.29. Even though it may not be possible for UNRRA to meet all the relief and rehabilitation needs of the populations affected by the war, neverthelessby approaching the tasks through the wise use of the technical resources ofthe United Nations, mobilized and engaged in the same spirit of cooperationas they are now devoted to the prosecution of the war, it should be &quot;possible,in the public health sphere, to attain comparable success in the war againstdisease and for the restoration of health.30. in the foregoing report the problems dealt with include those which it ishoped will be of value to the Director General and the Health Organizationand those which may require Council action. The matters which may requireCouncil action are presented in separate resolutions.31s57
COMMITTEE IV-SUBCOMMITTEE 3Report of the Subcommittee on Policies with Respect to Welfare ,Services Including Relations with Voluntary Relief AgenciesChairman; Jan Kwapinski (Poland). ,VicejChairman: Henrique Gil-Fortoul (Venezuela).Rapporteur: Viscount Alain du Pare (Belgium).Secretary: Harry Greenstein. ; :The Subcommittee on Policies with Respect to Welfare Services IncludingRelations with Voluntary Relief Agencies, having met and considered thematters referred to it, submits the following report to Committee IV:  (I) Within the framework of its total program and. with the closes&quot;collaboration between its health, welfare and other appropriate organizationunits, the Administration should make specific provision for welfare services for victims of war in particular for children, expectant arid nursing mothers, the aged and the disabled.As denned by the Subcommittee the term welfare includes[a) social relief such as food, clothing, shelter and other basic necessi-ties of life made available to persons unable through the effects of war to provide for themselves or their dependents, and(6) services for the personal rehabilitation of individuals requiringspecial help.(ii) In general, welfare services should be administered, as far as possible,by the country concerned and UNRRA should make its resources availableto the appropriate national governmental agency in accordance with plansagreed upon between UNRRA and the national agency.Continuous cooperation Should be maintained and information exchanged between the government concerned and UNRRA.(iii) UNRRA should be&apos; prepared to administer welfare services directly,either in part or in whole, when called upon by a government, who for any reason is unable itself to administer these services.(iv) Because of already prolonged suffering due to war and because of critical needs, UNRRA should arrange to provide, as promptly as possible,the necessary welfare services, to be available when countries are liberatedor occupied by the United Nations.(v) It should be the policy of UNRRA to enlist the co-operation andparticipation of foreign voluntary relief agencies which may, in the judgment of the Director General, have the competence, personnel, and other necessary resources which can be effectively integrated with the UNRRA- program.(vi) The Council, in furtherance of the above stated principle, should adoptthe attached resolution on &quot; The Role of Foreign Voluntary Relief AgenciesIn the Relief and Rehabilitation Program of UNRRA &quot;..(vii) Welfare services should be designed to help people to help them-. selves. Wherever possible constructive work opportunities and measures for self-help should be provided to permit those receiving relief to produce atleast some of their own basic requirements.(viii) Welfare services administered by or in co-operation with UNRRAshould be provided without discrimination because of race, religion,nationality, citizenship or political belief.(ix) Because of the magnitude and complexity of the welfare problemsconfronting UNRRA, and the necessity for effective technical guidance,there should be created by the Council a technical standing Committee on welfare.
Statement of Committee IV, Sub-Committee 3, for information and not&quot; for action(Policies with Respect to Welfare Services Including Relations with VoluntaryRelief Agencies)The following Statement was approved by Committee IV without change.STATEMENT(For Information and Not for Action)COMMITTEE IV-SUB-COMMITTEE 3;.Sub-Committee on Policies with Respect to Welfare services including Relations with Voluntary Relief AgenciesChairman: Jan Kwapinski of Poland.Vice-Chairman:  Henrique Gil-Fortoul of Venezuela.Rapporteur: Viscount Alain du Pare of Belgium.Secretary: Harry Greenstein.The Sub-Committee on Policies with Respect to Welfare Services IncludingRelations With Voluntary Relief Agencies, having met and considered thematters referred to it, submits the following statement for information andnot for action. In a separate report the Sub-Committee has made specific recommendations for consideration and action:  1. Reports presented by members of the Sub-Committee relate in grimdetail the appalling toll that war has exacted in their respective countries.They indicate too the importance of providing within the broad framework ofthe total UNRRA program, welfare services. *2. The principal groups of the population for which special welfare care willbe required are the children, particularly war orphans, persons disabledby war, the homeless and the stateless and, finally, families in which war has created welfare problems. In view of the magnitude of these needs it isalready apparent that a number of governments will require special and immediate assistance in dealing with these classes of populations.&apos;3, Millions of those in need as a result of the, war, obviously, are personswho in normal times would be wholly capable of providing for themselves and would not now require help except for the disaster that has overwhelmedthem.4. The extent to which UNRRA may need to co-operate in providing welfare services will, of course, depend upon the degree of disruption and destructionof the social and economic life of each area.Administrative Responsibility5. Since provision of welfare services in a country is a primary charge upon the government of that country the role of UNRRA should be to help,wherever necessary, to re-establish or strengthen national governmentalwelfare agencies. It should, therefore, be the general policy of UNRRA notto administer welfare services within a country with its own personnel but rather to make resources available to an appropriate national governmental* As defined by the subcommittee the term welfare includes: r-[a) social relief such as food, clothing, shelter, and (ther basic necessities of lifemade available to persons unable to provide for themselves or their dependants and(6) services for the personal rehabilitation of individuals requiring special help. .31857 &amp;
agency (or agencies) to be administered in accordance with plans agreed upon between UNRRA and the national agency. Where governments&apos; have notestablished or designated appropriate agencies to assume responsibility forwelfare services UjnREA itself may have to administer them. Or, UNRRAmay enter into direct working relationships with appropriate local govern-mental agencies and authorities or with voluntary agencies.Co-operation Between UNRRA and Foreign Voluntary Relief Agencies.6. Though one of the primary functions of UNRRA will be to help govern-ments to meet welfare needs existing within their respective jurisdictions, thisalone will not be enough. The resources, personnel and skill of voluntaryagencies, too, will be needed. Within such limits as may be imposed bynecessity, it should, therefore, be the policy of UNRRA to enlist the co-operation of ioreign voluntary relief agencies and to seek their participatiq&apos;in relief and rehabilitation measures which they have the competence, per-sonnel, and other resources to administer and which can be effectively in-tegrated with the UNRRA program as a whole.7. The close working relationship between UNRRA and voluntary agenciesenvisaged here will, obviously, require careful supervision and co-ordinationto prevent either duplication of service, or gaps in service. Foreseeing needfor such supervision and co-ordination the Agreement establishing UNRRAprescribes that foreign voluntary relief agencies may not initiate operations in any area receiving. relief from UNRRA unless subject to the regulationof the Director General.8. In furtherance of principles outlined here the subcommittee recommendsfor Council action the following resolution:  9. &quot; Whereas the Council is convinced that relief and welfare needs withina country are a primary responsibility of that country; and10. &quot; Whereas the Council recognizes that war has disrupted governmental services in certain occupied countries and destroyed national resources to such an extent that international co-operation must be relied upon toenable governments to meet their acute relief and welfare needs; and11. &quot; Whereas the Council realizing that even the combined resources of governments of such countries and of their national voluntary agencies mayleave unmet certain needs which the experience, personnel, skill,: and other resources of foreign voluntary relief, agencies may help to meet; it is, therefore  resolved,12. &quot; That it should be the policy of UNRRA to enlist the co-operation and seek the participation of appropriate foreign voluntary relief agencies,to the extent that they can be effectively utilized in relief activities for whichthey have special competence and resources, subject to the regulation of theDirector General in accordance with Article IV, paragraph 2 of the Agree-ment establishing the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administra-tion; and13. &quot; That the extent to which foreign voluntary relief agencies shouldbe used for assistance in the relief and rehabilitation of distressed people inany country should be a matter to be determined by the Director General inconsultation with the respective governments.&quot;General Welfare Principles14. The first objective of a welfare program must be to provide necessarysupplies and services, at the earliest possible moment, to men, women,and children who for various reasons arising out of the war are -unable to
care for themselves. In this connection it is extremely important to establishcenters of advice and information where people in need can be directed tosecure, with a minimum of delay, the help they need.15. Almost as important as the prompt provision of necessary supplies is tire method of their distribution. For example, in some instances what is most needed may be temporary measures for mass feeding or, perhaps, school-feeding projects. In other instances the use of food tickets or food ordersmi^ht be desirable. Again, it might be that cash allowances should be grantedto resourceless persons to permit them to purchase through normal channelsthe relief supplies they require.16. If, in initiating relief operations it is impossible immediately to inaugurate all needed measures or if, for any reason available resources should prove inadequate to meet all needs, it may be necessary to establish priorities,n establishing priorities early attention from the welfare standpoint must,of course, be given to the special needs of young children and youths. of paramount importance too is the provision of immediate aid to pregnantwomen and nursing mothers. Early consideration will also need to be accorded to key workers such as physicians and nurses.17. High among priorities established in any area will be welfare institu-tions (for children, the aged, disabled persons, or persons who are physicallyor mentally handicapped) which may require special allotments of food,blankets, clothing, or other necessities.18. Whatever priorities may have to be established, full consideration mustbe given to local opinion. To secure this guidance and to make certain thatpolicies adopted follow established patterns of community life wide use shouldbe made of local advisory groups composed of representative leaders of thecommunity. Furthermore, decisions reached must be carefully interpretedto local communities.19. Responsible authorities must constantly be aware of the extent of needsremaining unmet, and do all within their power to see that essential welfare services are provided as quickly as possible. For example, although-ininitiating operations it may be necessary to begin with the children effort must be made, as soon as circumstances permit, to extend needed assistanceto their parents also.20. Although certain priorities may have to be established there shouldbe no discrimination because of race, religion, nationality, citizenship or political belief.21. Welfare services should be designed to help people to help themselves.They must also permit recipients to maintain their self-respect.22. To prove truly rehabilitative, welfare services must be-of sufficientdiversity to meet the wide variety of needs. For example, provision&apos; formedicine as well as food, provision for a needed appliance, provision for toolsto a needy workman, or seed and equipment to a farmer who cannot securethem otherwise, may all help people to become self-supporting. Failure toprovide needy persons with those essential services, on the other hand, mayprolong the necessity for reliance upon relief measures.23. Wherever possible constructive work opportunities and measures for self-help should be provided to permit those receiving relief to produce atleast some of their own clothing and other requirements.24. Social insurance institutions in each country also offer a sound and permanent basis for constructive rehabilitation. Every effort should be taken,therefore, to rebuild.and strengthen these systems wherever necessary. Aged,sick gild disabled persons, widows and orphans and unemployed individuals
can be provided cash insurance payments through these institutions. Inthis way beneficiaries will be enabled to purchase their own requirementsthrough regular channels thus expediting the return to a normal way of life.25. There are also somewhat more extensive programs that will be needed.These include aid to broken families to help breadwinners and dependentsto reunite; vocational training or retraining of workers young or old, injuredor disabled, or workers temporarily or permanently displaced.26. Still another cardinal principle to be observed is that welfare servicesnust be carefully related to the customs, ways of life, and standards ofliving prevailing in the countries of operation. For example, foods to beprovided should so far as possible and consistent with proper standards of nutrition take into account native preferences. Clothing should be adapted to weather and local tastes. Also, account must be taken of the variouscultural and religious as well as social sensibilities.27. Furthermore, every effort should be made to preserve and strengthennormal social groupings. Rather than to initiate or prolong unnecessarilymass feeding, mass housing, families should, wherever possible, be helped to five together as families. Similarly, attempts should be made to enablechildren to live with their own or foster families rather than in institutionsunless specialized institutional treatment is clearly required.28. As aids to adapting welfare measures to national and local needs it willbe important in field operations to give national and local leaders a real voice in the framing of policies to be carried out. Only if this principle is observedcan services made available by or in co-operation with UNRRA make amaximum contribution to the strengthening of a nation&apos;s own continuingrelief and welfare measures.29. Careful adherence to the broad principles outlined here will also help to restore to self-support and self-sufficiency those who, for the moment and because of factors far beyond their control, temporarily need the welfare services that UNRRA may provide.Welfare Personnel.30. To insure effective administration of its program UNRRA willrequire qualified welfare personnel. In the selection of an administrative staff, therefore, first consideration must be given to technical competence.Whether the task is to care for orphaned or other disadvantaged children; toprovide for aged or disabled persons; to feed masses of men, women, andchildren; or to render any of the wide variety of services likely to be needed,the primary requisite should be knowledge of the. work to be done and skillin its performance.31. Among the types of welfare personnel likely to be needed arespecialists in the care of children; specialists in nutrition; specialists in the care and vocational training of disabled persons; specialists in the develop-ment of work oppoitunities through which needy persons can be helped toprovide some of their own requirements; specialists in the operation of welfareinstitutions, and specialists in the administration of employment offices andthe social insurances.32. Second in importance only to technical competence is a sympatheticunderstanding of the economic and social situation of the people among whomwelfare work is to be done. Consideration must also be given to the selection of personnel having a. knowledge and an appreciation-of the normal customs, andways. of-life&apos; of. the people. among \vhom they work. Ability to speaS the language of a people is, of course, to he desired but should be subordinatsd to technical competence.. .        ....... ....
ItA further consideration to be kept in mind in the selection of personnelis the ability to carry out responsibilities without favor, prejudice, ordiscrimination.oa Because of the pressure and difficult conditions under which relief work must&quot; be carried out, care must be exercised in placing-in demanding roles only those with sufficient physical vigor and stamina to perform their arduousduties successfully.35. Attention must also be given to the selection of personnel that will beflexible and adaptable. Staff members will need to be imaginative andingenious in devising ways of making resources yield the largest possiblereturns and in meeting problems not coming within their usual fields ofresponsibility.- o&amp;. Personnel engaged as members of the staff of UNRRA must have an appreciation of the principles underlying the ,UNRRA program. Further-more, since UNRRA is a truly international organization, its welfare staff should be comprised only of persons possessing an international viewpointand willing for the period of their employment by UNRRA to dissociatethemselves from any national interests or objectives which might conflict withtheir responsibility to the family of nations by which they are employed.37. In order that welfare workers whether employed- by UNRRA, byother governmental agencies or by voluntary organizations may be adequatelyprepared for their exacting duties the necessary training programs should be initiated immediately.Recommendation for Establishment of a Technical Standing Committee on welfare.38. Discussion by the Sub-Committee brought out sharply the magnitudeand complexity of the welfare problems confronting UNRRA. The Sub-Committee accordingly recommends to the appropriate committee of theCouncil the creation of a Technical Standing Committee on Welfare.COMMITTEE IV, SUB-COMMITTEE 4Report of the Sub-Committee on Policies with respect to Assistanceto Displaced PersonsChairman: Gustavo Gutierrez (Cuba).Vice-Chairman: Anders Frihagen (Norway).Rapporteur: Sir George Rendei (United Kingdom^.Secretary: George L. Warren.The Sub-Committee on Policies with respect to Assistance to displaced persons having met and considered the matters referred to it, submits thefollowing report to Committee IV:  1. The Sub-Committee has had before it the recommendation made to theCouncil by Sub-Committee 1 of Committee II, of which the relevant passageruns as follows: &quot;&quot;The supplies and services of which UNRRAjwill seek to ensure theprovision fall under four heads: .     &apos;       - &apos;-&apos; 2. Relief services: such as health and&apos; welfare; assistance in caring for and maintaining records of persons found in any areas under the control of anyof the United Nations who-by reason of war have been displaced from their homes and in agreement&quot; with the appropriate governments, military authori-- ties.-or other agencies, in securing their repatriation or return; and suchtekvjcal services as may be necessary for.these purpose ^s.&quot;
2. It has assumed that, in making recommendations to the Council on thesubject of the &quot; preparation and arrangements . . . for the return ofprisoners and exiles to their homes &apos;&apos;, provided for in the Preamble to theAgreement, it should be guided by the general terms of the recommendationof Sub-Committee i of Committee II referred to above. It has felt justifiedin interpreting those terms as widely as possible, and in also giving considera-tion to certain consequential aspects of the problem not specifically coveredby the terms of that recommendation.3. The Sub-Committee has also had before it a report prepared in October1943, by the Technical Advisory Committee on Displaced Populations which formed part of the Inter-Allied Committee on Post-War Requirements underthe Chairmanship of Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, as well as a factual survey ofthe whole problem of the Displacement of Population in Europe, prepared bythe International Labour.Office and published by that Office in Montreal^1943 (Studies and Report Series O (Migration No. 8)). Among the other documents which have been submitted to it for its guidance has been areport issued in September and October of this year by the Inter-AlliedCommittee in London for the preparation of an armistice containing varioustentative proposals for the establishment of a distinct international organisa-tion to deal with certain aspects of the problem of repatriation in Europe.4. In the light of the information before it the Sub-Committee felt that itshould begin by attempting a somewhat more detailed definition of the various categories of persons likely to be affected by the repatriation activities of unrra. In doing so it has taken into account such factors as their nation-ality of origin, the circumstances which have led to their removal from their homes, the countries in which&apos; their original homes were situated and whether these were identical or not with their countries of origin, the countries ofexile in which they may be found when UNRRA is in a position to render them assistance e.g. whether they are found in liberated or occupied territory, in territory which has been continuously under Allied control, orin the territory of neutral or non-belligerent States and also such factors as their material circumstances and their desire or otherwise to remain wherethey are, to return to their former homes or to be settled elsewhere.5. Bearing these various considerations in mind, and subject to what is said in paragraph 8 regarding the concurrence of the governments concerned, theSub-Committee has reached the conclusion[a) that UNRRA should in particular regard itself as responsible for assisting in the repatriation to their country of origin of those nationals of the United Nations who have been obliged to leave their homes by reasonof the war and are found in liberated or conquered territory;(6) that UNRRA should also assist those nationals of the United nations who have been displaced within their own (liberated) countries to return totheir homes in those counties, if requested to do so by the member government concerned;(c) that UNRRA should also assist in the repatriation of those nationals of the United Nations in other countries who are exiles as a result of thewar, and whose return to their homes in liberated territory is regarded as amatter of urgency;(d) that UNRRA should also assist those nationals of the United nations and those stateless persons who have been driven as a result of the war from their places of settled residence in countris of which they are notnationals, to return to those places.(e) that UNRRA should also assist in the repatriation of any other cate-gories of persons which can be shown to fall within the proper scope ofUNRR&apos;S activities in this respect.
n6 On the other hand it was decided by the Sub-Committee that UNRRAshould not have any responsibility for the repatriation of prisoners of war who have served in the armies of the United Nations unless requested bythe member government concerned to undertake such reponsibility in respectof any particular group. It was felt by certain members of the Sub-Committee that, while in the case of prisoners of war from the armies ofcertain of the United Nations no problem would arise, in other cases thefact that the prisoners had originally been prisoners of war is likely to havebeen to a large extent obscured by subsequent acts of the enemy authoritiesin illegally demobilising them, interning them as civilians, employing themin labour camps, deporting them to other territories or otherwise ignoringtheir military status. The Sub-Committee felt that in cases where this hasoccurred on a large scale the government concerned may well wish to invokefie assistance of UNRRA with a view to securing the early repatriation notonly of such prisoners but also of such of the prisoners of war from its army as have been allowed to retain their military character. The fact that the preamble of the Agreement specifically refers to the return of prisoners as one of the possible activities of UNRRA would seem not to exclude suchprisoners from its scope, although they are not specifically included in theresolution of11 Sub-Committee i of Committee II quoted above; and theSub-Committee therefore trusts that it will not be regarded as having exceededits powers in making the present recommendation on this point.7. The Sub-Committee fully accepted the necessity, referred to in theresolution, for the Administration to discharge responsibilities in assisting thereturn to their homes of the above categories or persons &quot; in agreement withthe appropriate governments military authorities, or other agencies &quot;concerned.8. As regards &quot; agreement with the appropriate governments,&quot; the Sub-Committee understands that the governments concerned may include thegovernment or governing authority (other than an enemy or ex-enemygovernment or governing authority) of the country in which the persons tobe repatriated are temporarily resident, of any? country through which theymay have to pass, of the country in which they were formerly residents, andof the country of which they are nationals. The Sub-Committee assumes that UNRRA in the course of seeking to reach agreement with these various governments will keep the other governments concerned fully informed ofthe progress of the negotiations. The Sub-Committee, recognizing thatUNRRA cannot render assistance to any of the categories of persons referredto above without the concurrence and co-operation of the governments con-cerned, which it will be the duty of UNRRA to secure, expresses the hopethat all the governments concerned will deal with any requests which theymay receive from UNRRA in this connexion in a spirit of wide humanityeven if the request refers to persons who are not then nationals. TheSub-Committee&apos;s further recommendations on this point and on the questionof co-operation with the military authorities are contained in paragraphs 14,15, 17, 20 and 23 below.9. As regards the question of co-operation with other agencies, the Sub-Committee is informed that the International Red &apos;Cross already possesses awealth of information and experience, particularly indexes containing some15 million names, including those of service personnel; interned civiliansand others which might be of the greatest value in assisting the work of unrra. There are also numerous other voluntary organisations which havespecialised in the work of succouring refugees and displaced persons whichcould render valuable assistance to the organs of UNRRA in this respect.The Sub-Committee recommends that the Administration should take steps
to ensure the closest co-operation with these agencies. In this connexion theSub-Committee welcomes and draws particular attention to the recommenda-tions contained in the report of Sub-Committee 3 of Committee II onRelations with other Intergovernmental Agencies.10. Another organisation v/ith which the closest co-operation will benecessary is the Inter-Governmental Committee on Refugees which has longdealt with those persons who have been obliged to leave their homes for reasons of race, religion or political belief. UNRRA will assist in the care and&apos;repatriation of such of those persons as can, and are willing to, returnto their countries of origin or of former residence. The Inter-Govern mentalCommittee has the function of finding places of settlement for such ofthem as fall within its competence and as cannot or do not desire to be sorepatriated. It should be the responsibility of the relief organs of UNRRA toassist, for a reasonable period, in the care of such of these refugees as cannibe repatriated, until the Inter-Governmental Committee is prepared to removethem to new places of settlement.11. The question what action if any should be taken by UNRRA inregard to assisting the return to their homes of displaced persons of enemy or ex-enemy nationality is one which presented particular difficulties. Inorder to ensure that the homes of United Nations nationals that, have beenintruded into and settled in by enemy or ex-enemy subjects, may be re-turned to their rightful owners, the Sub-Committee suggests, that while itis not the purpose of UNRRA to assist enemy subjects, the remc i/al of enemy or ex-enemy nationals, who may still be in occupation of the saidhomes, may he properly undertaken by UNRRA with the consent of thegovernment concerned.12. As however the return to their countries of origin may raise questionsof great complexity, the Sub-Committee suggests that this specific point should be referred to an early meeting of the Council as a separate issue,in order that a broad directive of policy may be laid down for dealing with it.13. Having agreed on the above general classification of the persons in whose repatriation, or return to their homes, UNRRA is likely to be calledupon to assist, the Sub-Committee considered certain other aspects of theproblem.14. In the first place the Sub-Committee was greatly impressed by thefact that, when the problem of the return of such people to their homespresents itself, it is likely to do so with the greatest urgency. On the liberation-tion of any territory from enemy occupation, or on the collapse of enemy control in other regions, where any large groups of displaced persons areresident, there is a grave danger that a mass movement of such persons maybegin before any adequate machinery to control or organise it has been set up. The Sub-Committee is aware that UNRRA will not normally becalled in during the military period in any liberated or occupied territory;but the Sub-Committee wishes to emphasize its view that, if the eventualtask of UNRRA in organising and providing for the repatriation and return of exiles to their homes is to be adequately carried out, it is vitally important that the closest liaison should be established with the military authorities ofthe United Nations in the territory concerned from the outset. In default of this, the already difficult task of controlling the. mass movements whichare likely to break out may be very greatly complicated.15. The Sub-Committee would emphasize that, unless this close liaison canbe arranged at an early stage, groups of displaced persons are likely to bedealt with in an uncoordinated manner. In particular it feels that themethods adopted for identifying and classifying the various categories of
sons t0 D,e repatriated should be based on a single principle from theutset, and it ventures to urge that preliminary discussions should take placet the earliest possible moment between the competent organisations of unrra and the governments concerned in order to establish some uniformsystem of dealing with these persons, during both the military and the sub-sequent periods. In this connexion the Sub-Committee would draw particular attention to the report of Sub-Committee i of Committee II on the relationship of UNRRA with the Military Command and Authorities established to controlEnemy Countries. - .j i rondly the Sub-Committee wishes to stress the vital importanceit cojbiders should be attached to the medical aspect of the problem.jn ,pe alone it is estimated that there are already tens of millions of dis-plaa.- persons who will need to be repatriated to their homes. It is clear(^at mass movements on such a scale are likely to cause an acute danger ofthe spread of epidemics, not only among the displaced persons themselvesbut in the countries of their residence, those through which they are likelyto pass, and those to which they will return. The Sub-Committee thereforerecommends that any organ created to deal with this problem should work inthe closest association with the medical and health organisations of UNRRA.in this connexion the Subcommittee would draw particular attention to therecommendations of Sub-Committee 2 of Committee IV, Policies with Respectto Health and Medical Care.17. Finally the Sub-Committee has been much impressed by the magnitude of the problem presented by the repatriation of these displaced persons and bythe complexity of some of the political issues likely to be involved. It there-fore recommends that the closest and most continuous liaison should be rnain-tained between the executive authorities of UNRRA entrusted with the organisa-tion of the task and the political authorities of the United Nations. This point is further dealt with below.18. As regards the organisation to be set up to give effect to the responsi-biiities which may be imposed on UNRRA in connexion with assistance to begiven for the repatriation of displaced persons, the Sub-Committee assumes that, in view of the provisions of Article IV of the Agreement by which it is laid down that the executive authority of UNRRA shall be in the Director-General and that he shall have full power and authority for carrying out opera-tions contemplated in the Agreement, the responsibility for organising and carrying out all the various complicated operations involved will fall on theDirector-General or on such Deputy Directors-General or other organs as hemay appoint or create for the purpose of dealing with this problem. TheSub-Committee therefore does not propose to make any detailed recommenda-tions regarding the precise form which this organisation should take. On theother hand, it considers it desirable to draw attention to the necessity ofdecentralising as far as possible the executive machinery of UNRRA inmatters pertaining to repatriation and to draw attention to certain specifictasks and duties which are likely to* fall on UNRRA in this connexion, and tomake certain broad suggestions with a view to assisting the Director-General to formulate his general policy, and with a view to ensuring that everything possible is done to secure immediate and effective action in this important field.19. Among the specific duties which the Sub-Committee considers will fallon UNRRA in connexion with this work, it would draw particular attentionto the following:  (a) the collection, and dissemination in the proper quarters, of detailedinlprmation as to the numbers, location and condition of the displaced popu-negotiations, including epidemiological information;31857 E
(b) the issue of preliminary instructions to civilian displaced personsthrough the radio or by other means;(c) the securing of agreement on a unified system of identification records,health certificates and preliminary identity papers for displaced persons in transit;(d) the despatch of special missions, authorised to take the necessary measures, do countries in which displaced populations are or are believed tobe situated; as far as possible these missions should contain members of thesame nationalities as the displaced populations concerned;(e) the provision of adequate shelter and accommodation for displaced persons, until they can be repatriated;(/) the issue of detailed instructions to displaced persons awaiting repatria-tion on the subject of registration, movement, medical examination and similar preliminaries to repatriation; ^(g) the negotiation with any regional or world wide international transportauthority, with the transport organs of the United Nations and with thecompetent authorities in the countries of transit, for the transport of dis-- placed populations;(h) the creation of central emergency stocks of food and of medicalrequirements to be available for supply to the returning populations at cer-tain stages of their journeys through various countries;(1) the necessary arrangements to ensure the supply of the requirementsof the displaced persons, including food, clothing, temporary housing and medical care, on their return to their homes; with respect to temporaryhousing, adequate use should be made of the recommendations formulated in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the section entitled &quot; Shelter &quot; of the report of sub-Committee 6 of Committee IV;(?) the establishment in accordance with the general policies of UNRRAwith respect to priorities of priorities for the repatriation of the various cate-gories of displaced persons.20. All those activities and duties would of course have to be performedin the closest consultation and co-operation with the governments concerned,which should be encouraged themselves to assume the greatest possible measureof responsibility for them, particularly in the case of the governments ofwhich the repatriates are nationals in matters of finance, though the neces-sary work of co-ordinating ail action in this sphere must, in the opinion of theSub-Committee, inevitably fall on UNRRA.21. it will be observed that the Sub-Committee has recommended in Sections(h) and (?) of paragraph 19 above the provision of supplies to meet therequirements of displaced persons before, during and after their movement.In this connexion the Sub-Committee wishes to emphasize firstly that emer-gency supplies of food and medicines may be required at very short notice atany point of the journeys of the returning exiles, particularly as there willbe a constant danger of epidemics which it must be possible to control andcheck immediately, and as it will clearly be difficult for any third countriesthrough which the repatriates may have to pass to undertake any large scalecommitments in connexion with them; and secondly that returning displaced persons are likely to find themselves in an even more distressed conditionthan those victims of war who have been able to remain in their ownhomes. This will be particularly so in the case of those whose homes andpossessions will be found to have been destroyed in the devastation causedby the events of the war. It may be that the definition of relief supplies and services adopted by Sub-Committee 1 of Committee II will be deemedadequate to cover the special needs which will arise in such circumstances.
9 fa&apos;)6&apos;uo22. The Sub-Committee wishes to emphasise that it has no desire to go beyond its proper sphere in making recommendations on this subject. At thesame time it teels bound to lay special stress upon the urgent need whichwill arise to provide for the reception, shelter and temporary maintenance ofany displaced persons on their arrival at their destination. In so far asUNRRA undertakes the responsibility of returning these persons to their homes it is clear that it must also be prepared to ensure that adequate pre-reparations are made for their reception, and for the provision for. them ofemergency shelter, food and household requirements if the Government con-cerned is unable itself to provide these necessaries or to provide them on asufficient scale, as may well occur in the case of certain devastated coun-tries. UNRRA must therefore, in the Sub-Committee&apos;s view, be prepared toaive a reasonable measure of assistance in these matters, since it would be4 reasonable that it should merely bring populations back to destroyed and devastated areas and leave them there to starve. Moreover, unlessadequate shelter and the immediate necessaries for a self-supporting existencecan, by one means or another, be provided, these persons will be unableto reestablish themselves in their homes, so that their last state may well beworee than their first. In this respect adequate use should be made of thepractical suggestions indicated by paragraph 7 of the section entitled&quot;Shelter &quot; of the report of Sub-Committee 6 of Committee IV.23. As has been stated above, the Sub-Committee does not feel justified inmaking any recommendations on the general organisation of the machinery required to deal v/ith this problem. It would-however direct attention to thefact that in many cases it will be necessary for UNRRA to deal with a numberof governments simultaneously and for the various governments concerned to reach joint decisions or to take joint action. The Sub-Committee feels thatthe Regional Committees of the Council of UNRRA may offer a particularlyuseful organisation for such joint action, and it therefore hopes that thegreatest possible use will be made of the Regional Committees by the autho-rities of UNRRA operating in each particular region. In this connexionthe Sub-Committee would draw particular attention to Section 3 of the resolu-tion of Sub-Committee 1 of Committee I on the Functions of the committees of the Council for Europe and the Far East in which it is laid down that the&apos;functions of the Regional Committees shall include &quot;the organisation of measures in regard to displaced persons and to the co-ordination of nationalaction in regard to medical and other relief and rehabilitation problemscommon to the area.&quot;24. Your Sub-Committee has approved the text of this report, which issummarized in the following recommendations:  (i) That the classes of persons to be repatriated be in the first instancethose referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 of this report;(ii) That the question of the assistance to be given by UNRRA in thereturn to their homes of displaced persons of enemy or ex-enemy nationalitywho have been intruded into homes from which nationals of the united nations have been expelled should be considered as a separate issue atan early meeting of the Council;(iii) That the attention of the Director-General should be particularlydrawn to the specific duties referred to in paragraph 19 of this report inconnexion with the repatriation of displaced persons;(iv) That steps should be taken to ensure the closest co-operation withthe Committee on Health, as well as with the national health authorities of the various countries concerned, with a view to preventing and con-trolling any epidemics which may be expected to arise in connexion withthe repatriation of large groups of displaced persons;31857 e 2
(v) That the Director-General should take steps to ensure the closestco-operation with such agencies as the International Red Cross and theInter-Govemrnental Committee on Refugees and any other appropriatebodies of suitable standing whose assistance may be of value,, with a viewto invoking their collaboration in the work of the repatriation of displaced persons;(vi) That the Director-General should establish the earliest possiblecontact with the military authorities of the United Nations with a viewto concerting plans for dealing in a uniform and closely co-ordinatedmanner with any large groups of displaced persons which may be foundin any liberated or occupied territoiy on the entry of the forces of theUnited Nations into that territory.COMMITTEE IV-SUB-COMMITTEE 5 ,Report of the Sub-committee on Policies Relating to AgriculturalRehabilitation and Other Means of Raising Food Essential to relief.Chairman:  E. S. Sergeev (U.S.S.R.),Vice-Chairman: Carlos Manuel Escalante (Costa Rica).Rapporteur:  J. H. Gorvin (United Kingdom).Secretary: H. W. Parisius.The Sub-committee on Policies Relating to Agricultural Rehabilitation andOther Means of Raising Food Essential to Relief having met and consideredthe matters referred to it, subrriits the following report to Committee IV:-Part IA. General Considerations1. The world food situation including both supplies and shipping requires that for the first crop year after liberation an absolute priority should begiven to the production of foods for direct human consumption.2. The rehabilitation of the pattern of agriculture in liberated areas andthe modification of that pattern to secure agreed nutritional aims can onlybe undertaken when danger of actual hunger has been removed. Once thishas been accomplished, agricultural production can be adjusted to meet moredesirable nutritional and agricultural goals.3. At the present time UNRRA should, concentrate its attention upon thefirst crop year after liberation. For that year the following factors are of primary importance:  (a) European agriculture apart from the devastated areas is- reduced but is a going concern. It has been producing all the food consumed duringthe war in Central and Western Europe including the food for the Germanand other Axis armies. The situation in the Far East taking the occupied countries as a whole is not dissimilar.(6) Agricultural production in these areas has been concentrated on providing food for direct human consumption. Expensive forms of animalhusbandry have been drastically reduced (pigs, poultry) and there are serious deficiencies in animal products although efforts have been madein Europe to maintain milk production.4. In the first crop year after liberation the war production pattern should as far as practicable be continued. Intensive efforts should be made to secure a fuller use of the land. When, however, as in certain areas the war pro-duction pattern had been prompted by an acute shortage of foodstuffs re-sulting in a disproportionate sacrifice in productivity, and provided alwaysthat other means can be found for providing essential foods, an early adjust-ment would be desirable to ensure more efficient production.
s. The first responsibility in most countries from the moment of liberationwill be to enable farmers to sow and harvest crops. In European countriesassistance may also be required at an early date to prevent the. furtherdepletion of dairy herds. The loCal or national authorities will have thenecessary knowledge for this task. These needs can be assessed with con-siderable accuracy and UNRRA should, in conjunction with the nationalauthorities, start forthwith to make provision to meet these deficiencies.6. The maintenance of livestock production and herds which is of such importance to agriculture requires that the control of animal diseases by allfeasible methods including the import of veterinary supplies be undertaken at the earliest possible time.7. In certain devastated areas the rehabilitation problem will require specialadditional efforts to re-equip farms with motive power, i.e., draught animalsf x tractors; to restore fertility to the soil; and to reconstitute essential live-stock especially for milk production.8. The Sub-committee agrees that the principal responsibility of UNRRAin the field of rehabilitation of agriculture and other forms of food production will be to assist local governments in providing the necessary supplies andequipment to increase production to the extent that such imports will reducethe need for relief after the second harvest. The importation of feedstuffsfor milk production should have priority over the importation of feed forother livestock production. The former should receive, in principle, second-dary consideration to the requirements for imports of food for direct human consumption. Where the need is urgent, the national governments should present a special case to the Standing Technical Committee on agriculture for readjustment of these priorities.9. Because of the shortage of animal proteins, fats, and vitamins, national governments or recognized authorities should take immediate steps to ensurethe early expansion of fisheries and of the whaling industry, and UNRRAshould assist to the fullest extent possible.10. In order to utilize to the greatest advantage the foodstuffs that arehome produced or imported, it is recommended that UNRRA should assistthe national governments or recognized authorities in restoring necessaryprocessing facilities. It is also recommended that in order.to obtain themaximum food value from bread grains the milling ratio should be main-tained at high levels, e.g., wheat at 85 per cent.11. It is recommended that experimental stations and other agriculturalinstitutions which can contribute to the solution of immediate post-war agri-culural and food production problems should be put into a position to resume their work as early as possible after liberation.Agricultural organizations and services, cooperative and other (includingmarketing and credit societies),&apos; had an important role in the provision offinance and agricultural equipment to farmers and in the collection and pro-cessing of farm produce. They should prove of special value in the immediaterelief period. Wherever the national authorities desire assistance in the re-establishment of such organizations, UNRRA should give such expert assist-ance as it can provide.12. Shortage of labor is proving a seriotfs handicap to production in anumber of countries. The Subcommittee therefore recommends that the re-instatement of agricultural workers should he achieved as early as possible.13. In the preceding paragraphs the Subcommittee has been dealing with the short-term problems and principally those of the first crop year. The Sub-committee has studied the reports and recommendations of the United Nations
Conference on Food and Agriculture and concurs generally in the conclusions reached at Hot Springs. The work of UNRRA will Ibe confined to the short-term problems of relief and the beginnings of rehabilitation. This work willbe the &quot;oasis of more permanent reconstruction, and it is of the utmost im-portance that the actions taken by UNRRA and by the governments in thatperiod should not hamper the long-term agricultural reconstruction programs.It should, in so far as possible, assist towards the achievement of the objectives of the United Nations Conference on Food and Agriculture, including the progressive realization in all countries of diets adequate both in quantity and quality.Responsibility for international action in longer term agricultural recon-struction is likely to rest with the United Nations Organization for Food and agriculture. The Subcommittee recommends that UNRRA take every neces-sary measure to secure the closet association between its own work and tb-activities of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. The Sub-committee does not consider that it is either desirable or necessary for it tomake any detailed proposals as to how this cooperation should be carriedout, but considers that UNRRA should seek the closest cooperation, not only between its Council and the Council of the Organization for Food and Agri-culture, but also between their respective staffs and standing committees.B. Priorities.i. The Subcommittee recognizes that UNRRA in approaching the problemof supplies for agricultural rehabilitation must relate such demands to the evenmore immediate need to provide food, medical supplies, clothing and otherrelief necessities. There is, however, a world shortage of many essentialfoods and war and relief demands will impose the need for continued economy in the use of shipping.For these reasons it is of the utmost importance to obtain from the soil ofthe occupied countries and from sea fisheries including whaling the maximum of food in the shortest possible time.These considerations clearly indicate the principles that should be adoptedby UNRRA in the determination of relative priorities among agricultural andother food production needs.2. The agricultural requirements of liberated areas include seeds, veterinarysupplies, pesticides, farm machinery and implements, fuel and lubricants,fertilizers, containers and processing equipment, feeding stuffs, and livestock,especially breeding and draught animals: and to this list should be added forcertain maritime countries the needs of the fishing industry: boats, repairmaterial, nets, hooks and other fishing gear. The priorities between these various items will presumably vary from area to area. Generally speaking,the Subcommittee considers that seeds, veterinary supplies and pesticidesshould receive priority immediately following that of the minimum programfor food, medical supplies and other urgent requirements such as clothing and soap; fuel for existing agricultural machinery and fisheries might haveequal priority with fuel for transport and domestic needs. The test shouldbe applied whether the supply of these requirements would bring early and large returns in the form of crops or of fish for direct human consumption;If so, it is recommended that UNRRA should accord the highest priority tosuch requirements. A further important consideration applying particularly to Europe should be to prevent the further depletion of dairy herds. Where,on the other hand, the requirements are sought for desirable but longer rangeobjectives of agricultural rehabilitation or where the building up of suchlivestock as pigs and poultry would bring about competition for supplies of direct value to human needs, UNRRA must insist that the fulfilment of these
needs must wait until there is no danger of a shortage of essential energy foods.The Subcommittee would not expect that any but a low priority could begranted in the first crop year to supplies for the feeding, of pigs and poultry.The Subcommittee would emphasize that in their recommendations theyhave attached the utmost importance to the agricultural needs of the first year after liberation. When the supply and import situation is more satis-factorv, and especially when feeding stuffs can be made available and meat and fat imported in quantities sufficient to bring consumption to a satisfactoryphysiological level, a longer term livestock recovery program should be putinto effect.Having regard to the importance of milling offals as a feed, the Sub-committee considers that the importation of grains should have priority over, flour, where the necessary milling capacity and requisites exist in the liberated&apos; - country.Similarly, the importation of vegetable oilseeds should have priority overthe manufactured products.3. The Subcommittee further recommends that particular attention shouldbe devoted to the production of those vegetables and pulses which have ahigh protein or vitamin content. The production of potatoes and their use for human consumption should also be increased to the maximum in liberated countries. Consequently it is recommended that a high priority should begiven to imports of seed potatoes and to seeds of other vegetables such ascabbages, savoys, swedes, turnips and carrots.4. The application of fertilizers will in -certain cases greatly increase foodproduction in the early post-war period. For this reason the Subcommitteeconsiders that everything possible should be done to restore fertilizer plantsto working order, and to resume importation of the most urgently neededsupplies as soon as possible.Steps should also be taken to restore oilseed crushing plants in relation tothe anticipated supplies of oilseeds. This has particular reference to feed fordairy herds.The Subcommittee also recommends the reestablishment of factories engagedin the production of pesticides.5. The provision of drying plants for meals and fertilizers should also berecognized as important in the immediate relief period.6. The problems of countries in the Far East differ in many ways fromthose of Europe; it,is to the latter that the foregoing paragraphs are principallydirected, especially as they would seem to be the more urgent in point of time.There is evidence that in the Far East there has been catastrophic depletion ofdraught animals and this factor may affect the suggested order of priorities for imports. A similar consideration may also apply to the more heavily devas-tated areas of Europe.7. The Subcommittee considers that UNRRA should forthwith consult withthe supply authorities in order to ensure that no time shall avoidably be lost in securing the most urgently needed supplies. Further, since full use ofcertain of the requirements for agricultural rehabilitation can only be madeat critical seasons of the year, particular attention in the case of these commodities will have to be directed to advance procurement by the appro-priate governmental or intergovernmental agencies in order that a full supplyof the minimum requirements may be available when the time comes.
Part IIOperating Policiesi. The Subcommittee recommends that programs of requirements for agri-cultural rehabilitation be submitted by national governments in consultationwith the regional committees in such detail as the complexity of the problemrequires. Arrangements should toe made for revising programs at. regular intervals in the light of most recent information.2. The Subcommittee recommends that national governments or recog-nised authorities provide for technical surveys in each area immediately afterliberations. UNRRA should hold itself in readiness to provide technical assistance if invited to do so by the national government or recognizedauthority established within the area. The regional organization shouldcollate these surveys in order to ensure that so far as possible comparablebases have been used. It-will be possible by these means to have earl;verification or amendment of the estimates which have been prepared in thepre-liberation period.3. The Subcommittee recommends that as a result of these nationalsurveys, and as soon as possible after liberation, national production pro-grams should be developed by the national governments ^ or recognizedauthorities of the acreages which will be sown with the various crops andof the output expected to be achieved from agricultural and fishery pro-duction. National governments or recognized authorities should base their estimates of requirements of agricultural supplies upon these productionplans.It is the national authorities which can best assess the needs of theirown countries, and the national representatives, in collaboration with the regional officers of UNRRA, will be able, to provide a realistic list of require-ments and an appropriate recommendation on priorities.4. By these means programs for agricultural materials which fall withinthe scope of UNRRA will be related to the detailed needs of each territory in relation to particular crops. They will show whether there are specialfeatures of the national production programs to which it may be desirableto draw attention, particularly if these programs call for specialized use offertilizers or other imported materials. Representatives of the countries re-ceiving supplies though UNRRA should agree to develop plans for the controlof imported agricultural materials in a manner designed to ensure the fullestattainment of the production program! Such countries should also developplans for assembling and distributing agricultural products to ensure thatfood needs of the area are met to the maximum extent.5. It is recommended that each national authority should be provided byUNRRA with such information as is available concerning production sur-pluses in nearby areas in order that the total supply of essential foods maybe attained to the maximum extent in relation to factors such as the avail-ability of imported rehabilitation materials. For instance, it may be possibleto use the anticipated surpluses in one area to remedy the deficiencies of anadjacent area. The regional organizations will probably be found to be themost suitable instruments for carrying out this work of co-ordination.6. The task which UNRRA will have to undertake will require the appoint-ment of technical officers to serve in its headquarters and regional offices andin the field. In so far as technical assistance in the field may be desired by the national authorities, UNRRA should undertake to do this.- The Subcommittee desires to point out that in some countries the nationalagricultural organization will have an adequate staff. of technicians at its
COMMITTEE IV.-SUBCOMMITTEE 6-Report of the Subcommittee on Policies Relating to rehabilitation of Such Industries, Transport, and Other Services as are essential to ReliefChairman: P. A. Kerstens (Netherlands).Vice-Chairman: Joaquin M. Elizalde (Philippine Commonwealth).Rapporteur: Baron Boel (Belgium).Secretary: John H. Cover.The Subcommittee on Policies Relating to Rehabilitation of such Indus-tries, Transport, and Other Services as are Essential to Relief, having met and considered the matters referred to it, submits the following report toCommittee IV.1. It has been stated in the preamble of the UNRRA Agreement thatpreparations and arrangements shall be made for assistance in the resump-tion of urgently needed industrial production and the restoration of essential services.2. Committee IT has interpreted this statement by deciding that rehabilitation-tation supplies are to consist of materials, such as raw materials, machinery and part parts needed to enable a recipient country to produce and trans-port relief supplies for. its own and other liberated territories; and that,within the scope of UNRRA, are to be included the rehabilitation of public utilities and services, so far as they can be repaired and restored to meetimmediate, basic needs, such essentials as light and water power, transporta-tion, and communications. The Subcommittee would assume that theseneeds would include rehabilitation of essential relief industries, such as thosewhich provide food,, shelter, clothing, medical supplies, etc.3. On that basis, policies have to be established(a) on the immediate and future purchasing of such raw materials,machinery and spare parts, and processing materials;(b) on the use of the potentialities of liberated areas, towards providingraw materials or manufactured products for relief and rehabilitation, for themselves and other liberated areas (concurrently the possibility 01 obtain-ing supplies from enemy countries should not be disregarded);(c) on the questions covering inland transportation (by land or water).4. The raw materials can be supplied either (a) by the liberated countryin which the industry is situated and in which the materials are to be used;(6) by another liberated country, or (c) by any other country. The task ofthe Administration in cases (a) and (&amp;) shall be the rehabilitation of the rawmaterial producing industry (coal mines, mineral mines, construction materialsindustries, etc.).disposal and will not so much require assistance for normal agriculturalduties, as for field officers who are specialists in the critical interpretation ofproduction in relation to requirements.7. The Subcommittee notes and concurs in the recommendations made bySubcommittee 1 of Committee I to establish a Standing Technical Com-mittee on Agriculture with regional sub-committees. Having regard to theimportance of the rehabilitation of agriculture in the immediate post-war period, the Subcommittee recommends that those committees be established and organized as soon as possible.
5. If the raw materials required must be imported from overseas, it shallbe the task of the UNRRA through the appropriate national or inter-govern-.rnen.al agencies to arrange for necessary allocation and procurement ofsupplies, so that there shall be created, as promptly as possible, reserves thatshall be available at the request of the Director General when and wherever the need arises.6. The same principle would apply to spare parts, each country giving i0the Administration necessary explanation of the number and types of machinesgenerally used and the number and types of spare parts which might be pur-chased beforehand. So far as machinery goes, the rehabilitation of industryrequires two types: normal and special types of machines. It is suggestedthat a certain stock of the normal type of machine tools be built up so as topermit their quick transportation to liberated areas. It is also suggested thata pool of mobile power units should be acquired. Certain processing mated?1-should also be stocked in time. Among these should be some mobile and ouWmaintenance equipment (welding units), lubricating oils, greases, belting, etc.7. If the existing home production exceeds home consumption, the gdVern-ment concerned.is expected to take all steps in order to enable the excess ofproduction available in this country to be put at the disposal of other liberated countries which may need such supplies to cover their deficits.8. It should be the policy of UNRRA to help those countries whose indus-tries can be rehabilitated&apos; for production of relief and rehabilitation goodsurgently required in other liberated areas, and if necessary, by special alloca-tions of raw materials, machinery, and spare parts, by placing at the disposalof those countries, at the request of their governments, an experienced staff,and by providing special priorities for the return of skilled personnel awaitingrepatriation.9. Member-governments having administrative authority in a liberated area will keep the Director General and the appropriate regional committee fully informed as to any surplus of supplies from time to time available in sucharea, to meet, when circumstances permit, relief and rehabilitation import requirements of other liberated areas.10. The whole policy of relief, including the rehabilitation of industriesproducing relief and rehabilitation goods for themselves or others, hingesnaturally upon a vast problem of inland transportation. Means of communica-tion must be restored to a satisfactory working condition. The movement ofall relief supplies and displaced persons by rail, road, inland waterways, coastal shipping, or air, must be regionally coordinated each national administra-tion to keep its sovereign power over transportation questions in its own country with due regard to international arrangements already made.11. UNRRA should work out in consultation with the national governments and an3&apos; international coordination authority which may be established a means of assisting liberated countries in putting the transport system in goodworking condition, and also to help in restoring equipment, repair shops,work shops, ship yards, and so on.12. A policy of procurement of proper and sufficient transportation equip-ment, both fixed and mobile, should be drawn up.. 13. A pool of transportation equipment should be created either from stocksmanufactured overseas or in allied or neutral countries. Equipment whichhas been the property of the enemy may also form part of the pool.14. If international organizations for Europe and/or the Far East for inland transport are not set up in time to operate at the moment of liberation, itshould be the task of UNRRA to participate in conjunction with military andother authorities in the organization and coordination of the transportation of relief and rehabilitation supplies during the relief and rehabilitation period.
15- Supposing the needs for inland transportation (rail, road, inland water-ways, coastal shipping, and air) to be covered by the suggested pool of inlandtransportation and port equipment, the needs for raw materials, machinery,spare parts, and processing materials as stated hereabove should be estab-lislied within each individual country, with a definite order of priority taking into consideration:  16 (a) technical factors such as, on the one hand, the necessity of restoringoublic services (gas, water, electricity) and, on the other, the order of prioritygiven in each country to the needs of various types of consumer goods;17 (b) social factors such as the necessity of providing re-employment.This problem will vary largely from country to country and from area to area.&quot; Not only will the war have created unemployment in certain areas,but the return of thousands of deported workers will require prompt action on.ihe part of the authorities locally responsible for order. Putting such men(^ack to work solves a dual purpose;, activation of industrial employment inthe liberated areas can be of great help to the United Nations in the prosecu-tion of the war, while the rapid resumption of industrial activity in the liberated areas can be one of the most efficient means of aiding relief and rehabilitation in such areas, and of lessening the strain upon materials and transportation facilities which UNRRA will encounter in accomplishing thetask of rehabilitation.18 (c) temporary economic factors such as scarcity of certain raw materials.In shaping policies for providing liberated areas with means of stimulatingindustrial activity, the fact must not be overlooked that a number of rawmaterials are in scarce supply. This will be the case especially as long as thewar continues and during the first months after liberation, when rehabilitationis undertaken. During that time, it will be necessary to devise a means of using, with the utmost economy, the sources of that type of supplies. It isa technical problem. Shipping and economic considerations will have to be weighed against social and financial ones, and it will be up to each governmentto find, for its own country, the solution eliminating the greatest number of difficulties.19. These governments, having established their definite order of priority in the rehabilitation of those industries essential to relief, will place before theAdministration (regional organizations for Europe and the Far East) the records and bases of their decision.20. This task of rehabilitation must not be considered as the beginning of reconstruction it is coterminous with relief. In the mind of the Subcommitteeno new construction or reconstruction work is covered by its conclusions, butonly rehabilitation as defined in the preamble of the Agreement. Subsidiaryproblems, such as unemployment, are important, but not determining factors.They are consequences and, at the same time, motives of action, but UNRRAcannot be called upon to help restore continuous employment in the world.Shelter1. Any general rebuilding policy in the areas to be liberated is in the sphere of long-term reconstruction and does not therefore come within the purview of UNRRA.2. In the relief period priority in the rehabilitation of essential shelter oraccommodation should be given to requirements for repairs in the liberated countries to:  Hospitals and schools.Accommodation for homeless persons, especially for workers engaged inessential public services and in industries having high priority in relief, aswell as for farmers and agricultural workers.
3. In some cases it may be essential, however, to import construction handtools, building supplies and equipments including excavating machinery,should this equipment not be found available or be in,short supply.&apos;4. As regards the problem of shelter&quot; for displaced persons, which falls into two parts temporary accommodation at collecting points and at frontiers, and accommodation of a more permanent, though not necessarily final character,for persons who cannot be returned to their homes either because their homeshave been destroyed or because these are in territories still occupied by theenemy wherever possible existing buildings, camps, barracks, hospitals andother public buildings, should be used as they are or can be made suitable.5. Where possible, because of the speed of erection, military huts, as used inthe Armies, would be suitable in connection with refugee collection, andarrangements should be made in conjunction with the military authorities tomake available some of these huts or to construct huts of a similar pattern tbe available against an emergency situation. Arrangements should where possible be undertaken for the use of local materials in the construction of temporary accommodation so that in countries where timber is not available,alternative methods of construction involving relatively small overseas ship-ments may be adopted.6. The attention of UNRRA is drawn to the service which pre-fabricatedhutting for camps for the accommodation of large numbers of displaced persons or factory workers can be made. Where pre-fabricated hutting is a specialisedindustry in an)&apos; of the territories of the UNRRA Member Governments, theimportance of making these supplies available as part of the contribution ofthese Governments should be recognized.7. Where, in some enemy occupied territories, extensive enemy colonisationhas taken place, and where consolidation of holdings and construction ofmilitary installations has been accompanied by destruction of farmhouses and buildings^ it may be necessary to, provide camp accommodation for farmers and agricultural workers on return to their own country. So far as possiblefarmers and agricultural workers should be housed in existing buildings or inavailable accommodations in neighbouring towns. Any large scale permanentreconstruction of holdings and the rebuilding of farmhouses and buildings willnot be the task of UNRRA but should proceed as rapidly as possible thereafter.The need for special provision or prompt creation of pools of building materialsso that advance arrangements can be made for the accommodation of farmers and agricultural workers should be included as parts of the essential needs in the relief period. In connection with the rehabilitation of workers&apos; accom-modations, the Subcommittee recommends that the collaboration of the I.L.O.should with the consent of the government concerned be invited.8. Although priority should be given to housing repairs as indicated in para-graph 2, should there be widespread destruction of particular areas caused by military operations or of a deliberate &quot; scorched earth &quot; policy on the partof the enemy, emergency accommodation or shelter for workers in the foodprocessing&apos;industries should be given high priority.9. It is of importance that arrangements should, with the consent of thegovernment concerned, be made for an expert assessment of this damage, sothat detailed and accurate specifications of the equipment required in thereconstruction of factories providing essential relief requirements and the shelteror accommodation of the workers engaged in these industries may be obtained at as early a date as possible. So that this work can be started, if possible,during the period of military responsibility for civilian relief and rehabilitation,it is urged that the Council recommend to its member governments that themilitary authorities be invited to advise the Administration, to the fullest
xtent consistent with military security, of conditions found in the area affect-in&quot; civiliaa.rehef and rehabilitation requirements and supplies, so that planning and estimating may be as accurate as possible.COMMITTEE ON AD HOC COMMITTEESFirst Report of the Committee on ad hoc Committees to the council chairman: Dean Acheson (United States).Secretary: Philip C. Jessiip.I. The Committee on Ad Hoc Committees having met and considered thequestion of the composition, of the Committee on Supplies and of the estab-lishment and composition of a Committee on Financial Control, submits theAllowing report to the Council.2. The Committee was informed that Subcommittee 2 of Committee III(Procedures for ascertaining and meeting deficits in supplies requiring importa-tion including procedures for dealing with the transportation of such supplies)had devoted consideration to the question of the functions of a supply com-mittee. In view of this fact, Subcommittee 1 of Committee I (Organizationof the Council: and its standing Committee) had not addressed itself to the composition of this committee or to the composition of a finance committee.3. The Committee considered the functions of the Committee on Supplies as suggested by. Subcommittee- 2; of Committee III and without expressing an opinion on the details, of the report of that Subcommittee, which at that stage had not been finally acted upon, was in full agreement upon the special importance of the Committee on Supplies and the role which it would neces-sarily play in the operations of the Administration.4. The Committee also considered the role of a committee on finance and reached the conclusion that it would be helpful to the Administration if theCouncil appointed a Committee on Financial Control. The functions of sucha committee would be generally to advise the Council on all financial matters within, the competency of the Administration, including budgetary matters,other than those falling within, the scope of the Supplies Committee, and toadvise the Director-General on any of these matters when he so requests.5. The work of the Committee on Financial Control would, in the opinionof the-Committee, be complementary to that of the Committee on Supplies, andthe composition of the two committees might be expected to- overlap to a con-siderahle, extent.6. To make the coordination between the activities of these two committeesmore effective,: the Committee felt it would be desirable to have a small sub-committee drawn; from; both committees, which would be the appropriate sub-committee to. advise the. Director-General relative to determining whether, agovernment is in a. position to pay, as provided in Section 17 of the FinancialPlan.. ;..7. The Committee devoted careful consideration to the composition of theCommittee on Supplies and the Committee on Financial Control having inmind the previsions of paragraph 4 of Article III of the Agreement which statesthat: &quot; The Committee on Supplies of the Council shall consist of the membersof the Council, or their alternates, representing those member governmentslikely to be principal suppliers of materials for relief and rehabilitation.&quot;8. The Committee recognized also the need for including in the composition of the Committee on Financial Control adequate representation of certain other interests and. points, of view which might not otherwise be represented inthe deliberations of the Committee on Supplies.   The Committee took the
view that both of these committees would naturally be composed of persons of special technical competence who would be available to attend meetings in the place in which the headquarters of the Administration were located.9. While the Committee is making a recommendation to the Council con-cerning the original composition of these two standing committees, it recog-nizes that it may prove to be. desirable to make additions to the committee as the work of the Administration develops as is contemplated in paragraph 4of Article III of the Agreement.10. The Committee accordingly recommends to the Council:  I. That the Council make the following appointments to the Committeeon Supplies:  The member of the Council from Australia.The member 01 the Council from Belgium.The member of the Council from Brazil.The member of the Council from Canada.The member of the Council from China.The member of the Council from the French Committee of national liberation.The member of the Council from the Netherlands. .The member of the Council from New Zealand.The   member of  the   Council  from  the  Union  of Soviet  socialist republics.The member of the Council from the United Kingdom.The member of the Council from the United States.II. That the Council establish a Committee to be known as the Com-mittee on Financial Control with the following functions:  (1) To review the annual budgets and any supplementary budgets ofthe Director General and to make reports, comments and recommendations to the Council on these budgets. (Agreement, Article VI, Regulations,section 4.)(2) To receive the quarterly&apos; reports of the Director General on administra-tive expenditures and receipts (Regulation, section 11) and to make reports to the Council regarding them.(3) To recommend auditors to the Council (Regulations, section 12) andto advise the Council regarding the scope and frequency of the reports to beobtained from the auditors. Such auditors&apos; reports shall cover, in par-ticular, the system of accounting employed by the Administration, the funds- expended in the purchase and received from the sale of supplies, the liabilities of&quot; the Administration and, generally, any matters of substancewhich the auditors may raise on examination of the Administration^accounts.(4) To make recommendations to the Council regarding the share of. the administrative expense of the Administration to be provided by each member government.   (Regulations, section 6.)(5) To give attention to the effect, if any, which the receipt and expendi-ture by the Administration of local currency proceeds, referred to inSection 19 of the Financial- Plan, may have upon inflation in any countryin which the Administration may operate, and make recommendations as toprocedures in relation to such receipts or expenditures which may aid incounteracting inflationary trends.
(6) Generally to advise the Council on all financial matters within thecompetency oi the Administration other than those falling within the scopeof the Committee on Supplies.(7) To advise the Director General upon any of the foregoing matters whenhe so requests.III. That the Council make the following appointments to the Com-mittee on Financial Control:  The member of the Council from China.The member of the Council from Greece.The member of the Council from Mexico.The member of the Council from Norway.The member of the Council from South Africa.The member of the Council from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.The member of the Council from the United Kingdom.The member of the Council from the United States.IV. That the Council approve cne appointment by the Chairman of theCommittee on Supplies, after consultation with the Chairman of the Com-mittee on Financial Control, of a sub-committee of not more than five members, of whom a &quot;majority would be drawn from the Committee on supplies with the other member or members drawn from the Committee on financial Control, and that this sub-committee be considered the appropriatesub-committee to advise the Director General relative to determining whethera government is in a position to pay, as provided in Section 17 of theFinancial Plan.V. That the Council authorize the Central Committee to make any furtherarrangements necessary in regard to the work of the Committee on supplies and to make emergency appointments between sessions of the Council, such appointments to continue until the next session of the Council.VI. That the Council authorize the Central Committee to make any furtherarrangements necessary in regard to the work of the Committee on financial control and to make emergency appointments between sessions of theCouncil, such appointments to continue until the next session of the Council.COMMITTEE  ON  AD  HOC  COMMITTEESSecond Report of the Committee on Ad Hoc committees to the council chairman :  Dean Acheson (United&apos; States).Secretary: Philip C. Jessup.1. The Committee on Ad Hoc Committees having met and considered,at the request of the Director-General, the fixing of the salary of the Director-General, submits the following report to the Council:  2. The Committee was informed by the Director-General that in connec-tion with his duty under Article VI of the Agreement to submit an adminis-trative budget to the Council, he would prefer not to be in the position ofindicating the salary which would attach to the Office of Director-Generaland he accordingly requested the Committee on Ad Hoc Committees to takethe matter under consideration.
(31857)   wt. 3617-7, 100   12/43   d.l.   g. 4503. The Committee empowered the Chairman to appoint a Subcommitteeto: consider this question. The Chair appointed the following Subcommittee:-Mr. Jean Monnet (French Committee).Dr. T. F. Tsiang (China).Mr. P. A. Kerstens (Netherlands). &apos;Mr. V. A. Sergeev.(U.S.S.R.)4. The Subcommittee presented the following report:&quot; November 22, 1943.&quot; My dear Mr. Chairman:&quot; You asked a subcommittee composed of the members for China, theNetherlands,&apos; U.S.S.R. and myself to bring in a recommendation relative to the salary of the Director-General of the Administration.&quot; We have met and considered the scale of salaries of the InternationalAdministrations. We have borne in mind the essential considerations thatthe salary should in the public mind reflect the dignity which we attach to the office of Director-General. We have been aware of some of thepublic discussions which in the past years have surrounded the questionsof the salaries of the leading officials: of some international organizations;we think it is most important that the Relief Administration should notbe involved in such controversies. . -&quot; We have not been ignorant of the fact that the United States Adminis-tration will presumably be the largest contributor to the International fund and to the Fund for Administrative expenses. ,&quot; Thus we have had in mind that the salary should be so fixed as to reflect proper dignity, be taken out of the realm of any discussion andbe: tied to salaries already adopted by one of the principal members ofthe Council.&quot; For these reasons we recommend that the Director-GeneraFs salarybe the salary of the members of the Cabinet of the President of the UnitedStates of America.&quot; Sincerely yours,(Signed) Jean Monnet, Chairman.&apos;(Signed) Dr. Tsiang.(Signed) P. A. Kerstens.(Signed) V. A. Sergeev.&quot;5. The Committee accepted the report of the Subcommittee. It was under-stood that the administrative budget would provide appropriate sums todefray the official expenses of the Director-General.6. Accordingly, the Committee on Ad Hoc Committees recommends to theCouncil the adoption of the following resolution (Resolution No. 39).
