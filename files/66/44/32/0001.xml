MILITARY SITUATION.The RussorGerman Campaign.Nevel Sector.23. The German reports of heavy Russian attacks from the 13th onwardsin the Nevel area have now been confirmed, and it is clear that the Russians havelaunched an offensive in considerable strength. By the 19th they had brokenthrough on a 50-mile front and greatly widened their salient in a southerlydirection towards Vitebsk. Since then they have made further progress south-wards. They claim to have inflicted very heavy casualties on the Germans and tohave captured considerable booty.Central Sector.24. Russian pressure towards Mogilev and Zhlobin has been maintained, butthere has been no change of position. Since the 20th the Germans have beencounter-attacking on-the Beresina.Kiev Sector.25. After a few days&apos; lull, the Germans resumed their attacks near Korostenon the 19th and claim to have regained some ground, but there is no evidence thatthey have made any progress of importance, and the German counter-offensive inthis sector appears to have lost much of its momentum.Dnieper Bend.26. After the capture of Cherkasy on the 14th, the Russian forces in that area linked up with those operating south-west of Kremenchug, so that theRussians are now well established across the Dnieper from Cherkasy to south ofZaporozhe. Heavy fighting has been taking place in the Kirovograd area, whereRussian attacks are meeting strong German resistance and counter-attacks. TheGermans have reported a renewal of Russian attacks south-west of Dniepro-petrovsk and against the Nikopol bridgehead, and they claim that these were allrepulsed after two days&apos; hard fighting.General.27. The most important event of the week has been the new russian offensive in the Nevel Sector. It is believed that the ground on the northern partof the front has now hardened enough to permit of large-scale operations. Thefrost on the Russian front as a whole is rather later than usual this year, but evenin the central and southern sectors it is not likely to be much longer delayed.In the Indian Ocean, exclusive of convoys of troopships engaged inoperational movements and of, troop convoys in the Bay of Bengal, 530 ships in44 convoys arrived at their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying.19. Mines were laid by aircraft off the Frisian Islands and the Biscay ports.Aircraft also laid mines off eastern Greece and in the Dodecanese.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.20.   There have been no reports of minelaying by either aircraft or surface craft during the week and no mines have been destroyed in Home Waters.The mine totals are 4.614 ground and 3.933 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.21.   The enemy ore traffic in the Bay of Biscay continues.The German s.s. Luise Bornhofen (2.860 tons) which has been in the Azoressince the beginning of the war has been bought by the Portuguese and renamedSete Cidades.During the period the 16th to 30th November nine enemy merchant ships totalling 31.144 tons were sunk; three of these, totalling 11.127 tons, were sunkin the Mediterranean.22. NOTE. Appendix III (allocation of shipping) is now issued in adifferent form and comprises two tables, one for tankers and another for non-tankers under British control.
Italy.28. In the Eighth Army sector the enemy has continued his determinedresistance to our advance and has been throw&apos;] ng in constant counter-attacks.On the 16th, two major counter-attacks were launched in an attempt to drivethe New Zealand and Indian troops hack from the Ortona-Orsogna road over which they had established a hold on the 15th. Both these attacks failed andthe enemy suffered heavy casualties in men and tanks. The following day ouradvance continued towards Ortona and Orsogna and good progress has beenreported by all our divisions. On the 19th, Canadian tanks broke through theenemy anti-tank screen and over-ran infantry positions in the Ortona areainflicting heavy casualties. Since then, progress has been maintained towardsthe lateral road from Ortona to Orsogna, most of which was, by the 23rd, either in our hands or under the lire of our guns.In the central mountain sector patrol activity continued throughout theweek. An enemy counter-attack on the 22nd has been reported, but this wasrepulsed.In the Fifth Army sector some progress has been made in the mountainouscountry to the east of Cassirto. French forces, operating on the right flank,captured a pass near Mt. Mare on the 16th, held off several heavy counter-attacksbut were forced to withdraw slightly on the 20th. Farther south, the village ofS. Pie vo finally fell tc U.S. forces on the 19th and the mountain positions on either r Je of the Mignano gap are now firmly in our hands. An attack by&apos;inA&quot; .cry and tanks had started two days previously against the last and most strongly defended German position in this area. Desperate resistance was met and there was heavy fighting before the village was captured. Considerabledemolitions were encountered but engineers, following hard on the heels of the assault troops, quickly cleared a passage for vehicles and tanks. forward troops are now some two miles west of the village.Activity along the R. Garigliano has again been confined to patrols whileBritish troops have been regrouping and consolidating their positions. A smallenemy counter-attack east of S. Ambrogio on the 22nd made no headway.Yugoslavia.29. The general German offensive recently reported by the Partisans has sofar succeeded only in the Sarajevo area. Here the Germans have driven the partisans from a considerable area south-east of the city. The main fighting hasnow shifted to the north of the city, where the Partisans have recapturedVlasenica and part of Tuzla. In West Bosnia the Germans recaptured Livno,but have not been able to penetrate any further north.In the Korolun area (40 miles south of Zagreb) after a number of minorengagements the German offensive has spent itself. German casualties in this area from the 6th to 15th were reported as 416 killed and 117 wounded.In the coastal area, the Partisans have occupied two small ports south ofSibenik and one south of Zara. Partisan attacks on railways in Slovenia have continued successfully.Greece.30. Zervas, the E.D.E.S. commander, reported fighting between his forces and the Germans south of Yanina.British Liaison Officers have reported that E.D.E.S. defeated E.L.A.S. in a counter-offensive east of Amphilochia.Burma.31. Our forces in the Arakan have made small advances against lightopposition.In the Chin Hills an Indian brigade attacked enemy positions ten miles south-east of Tiddim on the 14th. The force withdrew on the following dayleaving patrols in contact with the enemy, who did not follow up.China.\ 32. The majority of the Japanese in the Changteh area of Central Chinahave now withdrawn to the north and east of the Yangtze River, leaving behindsmall detachments to cover their retirement.
Pacific Theatre,New- Guinea.33. The Australians advancing from Finschhafen captured Lakona,12 miles north of Finschhafen, and on the 18th crossed the Masaweng Rivej\two miles further north, where the Japanese had been expected to make a stand.The Australians captured three field guns and a large quantity of other equip-ment and are making good progress beyond the river.The Japanese resisting west of Lakona are now cut off from the possibilityof supply or reinforcement from the coast.New Britain.34. On the 15th, U.S. forces landed on the Arawe Peninsula, in the south-west of New Britain, under cover of a naval and air bombardment. Groundopposition has been slight. TJ.S. troops have captured the airfield three and a half miles east of Arawe, while patrols have reached the Itni River, forty miles west of Arawe, without contacting the enemy.Solomons.35. On Bougainville there has been patrol activity only. One Allied patroladvanced to Cape Molkte, 22 miles north-west of Gape Torokina, where itcontacted the enemy and later withdrew.There are indications that the Japanese are carrying out withdrawals from south to North Bougainville, and are concentrating in the Tinputs Harbour area(on the northern shore of the East Coast), whence they might evacuate the island.AIR SITUATION.General Review.36. U.S. heavy bombers made heavy daylight attacks on Bremen, Osnabruckand Munster and at night, Bomber Command aircraft heavily attacked berlin and Frankfurt.Allied bombers attacked railways in Northern Italy and at Innsbruck.   in italy, Allied aircraft provided support for our land forces in the battle area.In the Pacific, heavy attacks were made on enemy targets in New Britain.United Kingdom.37.

Photographs taken of Bremen on the 21st show the results of recent attacks by U.S. aircraft (see Appendix VII).On three days, a total of 750 medium, 210 light and 463 fighter-bombers ofthe Allied Expeditionary Air Force, was despatched to attack military objectives in the Pas d.e Calais. Owing to unfavourable weather conditions, only 127medium, 77 light and 314 fighter-bombers attacked the primary target dropping299 tons of bombs and firing 480 rocket projectiles with varied results. Of theremaining aircraft, about 80 attacked other objectives, including gun positionsan airfield and a military camp. A further 19 fighter-bombers attacked military objectives in the Cherbourg Peninsula, but results could not be observed in all these operations, Allied fighters (which flew 4,027 sorties during theweek) and bombers destroyed 120 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 48 and damaged 37 for the loss of 59 heavy bombers and 28 fighters and fighter-bombersNight-40   Bomber Command aircraft attacked the following targets : Date.

Some reports indicate that the marker bombs fell short of the target, while others indicate a fairly good concentration of markersas the attack progressed. Conflicting reports make assessment of results difficult,but no concentration of bombing appears to have been achieved. Fires covering a wide area were started and these appeared to be taking a firm hold in the later stages of the attack.At Mannheim, visibility was good and the target could be seen clearly. Themarker bombs were in the main well concentrated although some crews reportthat a number fell short of the target. Several fires were started which latermerged into good concentrations.The two attacks on the military objectives near Abbeville were made in goodvisibility. In the first attack, the majority of the marker bombs were accuratelyplaced and a good concentration of bombing was achieved; in the second, bombingis thought to have been concentrated, although low cloud made it difficult to assessresults.Small-scale attacks were made by a total of 50 Mosquitoes and eightLancasters on Liege, Duisburg, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Cologne, Leverkusen,Bonn and Rheinhausen.  One Lancaster is missing.Intruder aircraft flew 49 sorties over France, the Low Countries andGermany.

It is reported that on the 15th, the Russian Air Force flew 3,400 sorties in the sector between Nevel and the Pripet Marshes. These attacks were, in themain, carried out by ground-attack aircraft with strong fighter cover. On thesame day, there was fighter and reconnaissance activity over Kerch, and groundattack and fighter activity in the Kiev salient. For the remainder&apos; of the weekvery little information of Russian air activity is available, although there is little doubt that close support activities were continued in the Nevel area.Against the high total of Russian sorties flown in the Nevel area, theGerman reaction has been weak and quite inadequate for the support of their troops. No help was afforded in this situation by forces from other sectors.It is known that two-thirds of the German Air Force, based on the russian front, are based to the south of Kiev.

Casualties were very light and while some temporary dis-location was caused to railway transport, incidents were mainly of a very minorcharacter. At the same time the nuisance value of these raids was demonstratedon Tuesday night when a few aircraft caused most of the country east of alme Bognor/Kettermg/The Wash to be under Red Warning for an average of40 minutes. &amp;

Only a comparatively small part of Berlin is covered on photo-graphs taken on the 20th December, the centre of the city being amongst the areasomitted. Damage is seen, nevertheless, to be extremely heavy, especially to industry. Public utilities and power stations have also been severely affected and business and residential damage is everywhere considerable, especially inthe districts of Wilmersdorf, Schoneberg and Reinickendorf.Amongst items of severe industrial damage, many of which have alreadybeen reported by ground sources, are the following : Stahlbau Wittenau, G.m.b.H., Heavy engineering, Reinickendorf.Norddeutsche Dornierwerke G.m.b.H., A/c Components, Reinickendorf.Heinkel Werke G.m.b.H., Aircraft party, Reinickendorf.Argus Motoren G.m.b.H., Aero engines, Spandau.Maschinenfbk. Prometheus G.m.b.H., Engineering, Reinickendorf.Auto Union A.G., Repair Shops, Wilmersdorf.Berliner Verkehrs-Betriebe, Transport, Tempelhof.Kiel. An informant who was in Kiel on the 13th December reports thatthe attack by the U.S.A.A.F. was very successful. The accuracy of the bombing-carried out through low clouds, which must have made the town invisible fromthe air, had a terrifying effect upon the population, many of whom left the townlater in the day.The two main areas of damage were in the centre of the city round the lakecalled Kleiner Kiel, and on the east bank of the harbour in the district of Gaarden.
In the former area among the many buildings damaged were the town hall andthe State Theatre. Damage to housing in the Gaarden district was very heavy,and buildings in the Deutsche Werke were hit. When informant left the townthat night, many fires were still burning on the east bank.Bremen.-Photographs taken on the 21st December after several U.S.A.A.F.attacks, the last being on the 20th December, cover the town except the IndustrieHafen and parts to the North. Smoke from fires still burning renders interpreta-tion difficult, but it can be seen that damage to industrial and shipping facilities is extensive and a large number of warehouses along the Hafens I and II havebeen gutted or damaged. The petroleum refinery and the blending plant atMineralol Raffinerie vorm. August Korff to the West of the Atlas Werkeshipbuilding yards are damaged and fires are still burning in this area.A medium-sized M.V. is on fire and there is some damage to the buildings inthe yards. Considerable business and residential damage has been caused in thedistrict of Doventors.Leipzig. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the20th December, after the attack on the 3rd/4th December, shows very heavy and widespread damage, especially in the centre of the town. Damage to industrial and transport targets is particularly severe. Three railway stations and. manyrailside storage buildings have been hit, and two gas works and the northpower station have been seriously damaged. Amongst other heavy industrialdamage are the following : Leipziger Wollkammerei Woolcombing.Asphalt Rob-Emil Kollner Asphalt, Roofing felt.A.B.C. Baumaschinen-Eabrik Schumann &amp; Co. Building Machinery.Rothenstein Accumulatoren A.G. Accumulators.R. Kern Rubber Goods.Border &amp; Co., A.G., Gebr. (1936)-Steel Goods.Dr. Max TJirich KG. Electrical Apparatus.Leipzig World Fair Manufacture of war material for Junkers.Bleichert Transport Anlage G.m.b.H.Italy.Turin. As a result of the attack on the 1st December, the Turin Riv Works(ball-bearings) were virtually destroyed.Norway.Oslo I Kjeller. Jt is learned that the Germans were holding militarymanoeuvres in the Kjeller district on the 18th November at the time of theU.S.A.A.F. attack, and for this reason Norwegian personnel were denied access to the airfield. As a result, there were virtually no Norwegian casualties, while some 200 German soldiers were killed and double that number injured. It is saidthat many of the Germans lost their nerve, and that the A.A. defences, mistakingthe attacking aircraft for part of the manoeuvres, did not open fire until very late.Damage at the aerodrome and factories was severe, particularly at theB.M.W. works.  One source assesses the damage as *Per cent.B.M.W.   ...      .........      ......      100Daimler Benz    ...      ...      ...      ...       ...        75Brinker Eisenwerke     ...      ...      ...       ...        50Several hangars, many of them new and large, and including the rebuilt&quot; 100-metre hangar,&quot; were destroyed with some 15 aircraft in them, whileapproximately 150 aero-engines in course of repair were either completely destroyed or very severely damaged.Rjukan. During the attack on Vemork on the 16th November, two machinesin the main power station were destroyed and two more in the reserve station,which was also hit, were severely damaged. The suspension bridge over theRiver Maan was hit and had to be closed. At the Rjukan chemical works&apos;bothTowerhouse I and II were damaged, and. the packing factory and the barrelfactory were destroyed. -
