THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  December 1943.1 28SECRET.W.P. (43) 568,loth December, 1943.Copy No.    &amp; liWAR CABINET.SPEAKERS CONFERENCE ON ELECTORAL REFORM.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.AT their meeting on the 11th October the War Cabinet decided (W.M. (43)138th Conclusions) that there should be a two days&apos; Debate early in the new session on a motion for the appointment of a Speaker&apos;s Conference to consider questionsof electoral reform, that the motion should include a list of the questions to beconsidered by the conference, that the list should cover proportional representationbut that it should be open to any Members to move an amendment for the omission of this or any other item from the list, and that the whole question of redistributionshould be referred to the Speaker&apos;s Conference for further consideration and early report, primarily with a view to obtaining the assistance of the Conferencein framing the directions for the Boundary Commissioners.2. On the 14th October the Prime Minister announced in the House that two days would be set apart for the Debate, and that, in the view of the Govern-ment, the best method of securing the full examination of the problems of electoral reform, &amp;c, would be a Conference presided over by Mr. Speaker. It had previously been- ascertained that the Speaker would be willing to accept such an invitation.3. When Speakers&apos; Conferences on electoral reform were set up in 1916 and1930 the procedure was for the Prime Minister to write a letter to the Speakerinviting him to preside over a Conference. It was left to the Speaker to choose the Members of the Conference. In each case the reports of the Conferences weremade in the form of a letter from the Speaker to the Prime Minister. the speaker&apos;s letter of 1917 said : :&apos; The Members of Parliament and Peers whom selected appeared to me to be eminently representative of the various shades ofpolitical opinion.&quot; The Speaker&apos;s letter to the Prime Minister of 1930said : &quot; The Conference over which you invited me to preside was formed from three panels of names submitted to me by the Labour, the Conservative and theLiberal Parties.  My Selection was as follows......&quot;I presume that the same procedure will be followed on the present occasion,viz., that the Prime Minister will write a formal letter to the Speaker setting out the subjects for consideration, and that the choice of Members of theConference will be left to the Speaker, who will be free to include some Peers.4. On the two previous occasions there was no Parliamentary Debate in theHouse, and ho resolution was passed approving the proposal to have a Speaker&apos;conference. On the present occasion it will be necessary to provide a text for thetwo days&apos; Debate, and the best plan (assuming that an Adjournment Motion wouldnot be suitable) would appear to be for the Government to submit to the houses resolution welcoming the proposal that there should be a conference preside over by Mr. Speaker. After the approval of the House has been given to this resolution the formal letter of invitation should&apos; be ;sent to Mr. Speaker.5. It is proposed that the conference should consider the following subjects : (a) Redistribution of seats.(&amp;) Reform of franchise (both Parliamentary and Local Government).(c) Conduct and costs of Parliamentary Elections.(d) Methods of election.[26572]
As explained in paragraph 1, the decision of the War Cabinet was that the motion should include a list of these subjects, but I think, on reconsideration, thatit would be preferable that they should not be given in the resolution itself,but should be announced in the speech opening the Debate. This would be more in accordance with precedent in 1916 the terms of reference were announced by Mr. Bonar Law in answer to a Private Notice Question (the 10th October,1916) and it would, I think, have the advantage of reducing the likelihood of amendments.   The Chief Whips agree.I would suggest that.the Motion should be in the following form : &quot; That this House welcomes the proposal of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto set up a Conference on electoral reform and redistribution of seats to bepresided over by Mr. Speaker.&quot;6. It is, I hope, unlikely that any amendment will be proposed to this resolution, but if any amendment should be proposed for example, an amend-ment excluding proportional representation from the consideration of theConference what is to be the attitude of the Government ?At the meeting of the War Cabinet on the 11th October the question was raised whether such an amendment should be left to a free vote of the House, butthe War Cabinet took no decision on this question.Originally I inclined to the view that it would be waste of time to includeproportional representation in the agenda of the Conference, but I now&apos; thinkthat, on balance, it would be better for the Government, having announced thatthe Conference will have wide terms of reference, to adhere to that decision andto nesist any amendments designed to narrow the scope of the agenda or limit the discretion left by that agenda to the Conference. I would suggest, therefore,that any amendments to the proposed Resolution should be resisted by theGovernment, and that, if a decision is pressed, the Government Whips shouldbe put on.7. My colleagues on the Committee on Electoral Machinery concur in theproposals in paragraphs 5 and 6 above.8. The order in which the Conference will consider the several items willbe a matter for the Conference itself to settle.A desire was expressed by some of my colleagues that the question of redistribution should have priority, and until the Conference reports on thismatter it will not be possible to introduce the proposed Bill creating permanent machinery for ensuring that the question whether there is a case for redistributionshall be periodically considered. This subject is, therefore, of some urgency, but-the settlement of the principles by which the proposed Boundary Commissionersare to be guided will, I fear, present difficulty, and the exploration of the subject by the Conference may take some time.An early report from the Conference is also desirable on the Local Govern-ment franchise. There will be considerable pressure in Parliament for legislation to enable local elections to be resumed, and before the Local Elections (temporary provisions) Act expires at the end of 1944 the necessary legislation ought to beintroduced to enable a register of local government voters.to. be compiled.I would suggest that the letter to be sent after the Debate by the PrimeMinister to the Speaker should call attention to the desirability of early reports on these two subjects, and should ask that the Conference will consider thequestion of presenting separate reports on these matters without waiting till theyhave concluded their deliberations on all the items in their programme.(Initialled) H. M.Home Office, S.W.1,15th December, 1943.
