THIS DOCUMENT IE THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  December 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 590.30th December, 1943.WAR CABINET.THE INDIAN FINANCE MEMBERSHIP.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.THE normal term of office of Sir Jeremy Raisman, the present FinanceMember of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council, comes to an end in April, and it isvery desirable that an early decision should be reached as to the appointment ofa successor. Lord Wavell in the attached telegram expresses the strong opinionthat his successor should be an Indian, and recommends the appointment ofSir Ramaswami Mudaliar.There are really two separate questions involved. The first is whether thenew Finance Member should, as hitherto, be a financial expert or should be a man of general political and administrative experience. The second is whether heshould be, as hitherto, a European or should be an Indian.I have discussed the matter with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and withthe Governor of the Bank of England, both of whom attach great importance tothe appointment of an expert with wide experience outside India of public and international finance in view of the complexity and magnitude of the financial problems now facing India and of the difficult discussions with the Governmentof the United Kingdom which will arise at the end of the war with regard tothe handling of India&apos;s sterling balances and on many other matters.Mr. Montagu Norman stressed the fact that the Governorship of the reserve bank has recently been entrusted to an Indian ex-official of no very profoundexperience of banking. Both are agreed that such an expert would have to beof the highest recognised standing and ability. Only one name has occurred tous as of a person possessing the necessary qualifications and as possibly Thoughvery doubtfully available.As against this argument I must point out that the whole character of theExecutive Council has been completely transformed in recent years. It is nolonger a small Council of expert officials but, in effect, a Cabinet, overwhelminglyIndian, of men chosen for their general political and adniirristfative ability andrelying in every department, with the exception of War, Home and Finance, forexpert guidance upon their senior officials. In such a body the important thingis, not that the Minister in charge of a department should be himself an expert,but that he should be capable of weighing the advice of his experts and then,having come to his conclusions, of convincing his colleagues.This consideration weighs with exceptional force in favour of an IndianFinance Member in the present Executive and in view of the problems to be faced. Any new Finance Member sent out from here, especially if in any wayconnected with the Treasury or the Bank of England, will be resented at the outset and always regarded with suspicion as there to defend British financial interests. Measures to meet the present financial situation or, later on, some reasonable agreement with the Treasury over outstanding questions, will havefar less chance of acceptance if put forward by him than if advocated by someonewhose primary concern for Indian interests cannot be in doubt and who exerciseslong-standing personal influence with his colleagues.I therefore support the Viceroy&apos;s recommendation on merits, apart from anywider political considerations. I would add that he is fortunate in havingavailable in Sir R. Mudaliar a man of first-rate intellectual ability, who could[26646]Copy No.
hold his place in a Cabinet anywhere, of wide experience in dealing with industrial and economic problems, and, what is even more important, of courage andconviction including a firm conviction of the necessity of maintaining theBritish connexion.The Viceroy is satisfied, that he can furnish Sir R. Mudaliar with thenecessary technical assistance from within the Indian Finance Department, but is quite willing to consider someone suggested from here if wider experience isconsidered essential. The Governor of the Bank has mentioned to me the nameof one of his men who, in his opinion, is admirably qualified,, even if his name isnot sufficiently well known to make him altogether suitable for the actual FinanceMembership.     1As regards the political aspect of the appointment, it is becoming increasingly&apos;clear that there is no prospect of the Indian parties coming together in the nearfuture for the purpose of forming a more representative Government under thepresent constitution, or of any early agreement upon a constitution after the war.In that situation the sense of frustration and of bitterness, however illogical and&apos; unreasonable, against the British connexion is bound to grow, unless we can insome way or other demonstrate the sincerity of our desire to see India governed,by Indians and in India&apos;s interests.The only effective way open to us is to entrust more power to Indians in theactual administration. What is more, whatever may be said of the efficiency ofIndian ministries subject, under our particular Parliamentary system, to the day by day control of their party caucuses, Indian administrators free from such control have shown themselves by no means incapable. The Indian States have produced - many able administrators. The Viceroy&apos;s present Executive have, i feel, never had the credit due to them for the courage with which they un-hesitatingly dealt with &quot;the Gandhi rebellion of August 1942 or for the generalsuccess of their administration during the last two years. It is at least open to doubt whether an official government of the pre-1940 type could have done betteror have enjoyed the measure of public support or, at its lowest, acquiescence,which they have, in fact, received. In any case they are the only instrument of anational character with which the Government of India can now be carried on.To strengthen its authority in Indian eyes and to increase the confidence of its members in themselves and in the trust we repose in them, seems to me the only way of carrying on without a breakdown until such time as a constitutionalsolution emerges.From that point of view there is no doubt that in the eyes of the Membersof the Viceroy&apos;s Executive, as well as of the general educated public, the reserva-tion of the key posts of Finance and Home Affairs has been regarded as evidenceof our fundamental distrust and as proof of the discrepancy between our generalprofessions about Indian self-government and our actual practice. It would beidle to suppose that the appointment of Sir R. Mudaliar would be greeted with enthusiasm by either the Congress or the Muslim League or by their journals inthe Indian Press. It would not suit the book of either of these parties. But itwould all the same have some effect on the thinking public and it would certainlygive increased confidence and authority to the Executive as a whole. On the otherhand, there can be no doubt that the appointment of a new comer from here wouldnot only be the target of fresh denunciation itself not a matter of great conse-quence but a very real discouragement to the men on whose co-operation LordWavell must rely for the carrying out of his difficult task.I have not discussed a third alternative, namely, the extension of the presentFinance Member&apos;s appointment for another year. Sir J. Raisman is tired anda fresh hand at the helm is what is needed. In any case postponement only meansfacing the same decision a year hence and probably under even more difficult conditions. Sir J. Raisman himself agrees with the Viceroy that if the change is to be made it is as well made now as later on.L. S. AIndia Office, 30th December, 1943.
ANNEX.Cypher Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India.(Dated New Delhi, 2045 hours, 24th December, 1943.)(Received 0245 hours, 25th December, 1943.)2832 H. Finance Membership. I am strongly of opinion that when Raisrnanleaves in April 1944 he should be succeeded by an Indian. Argument that finance department needs at its head an expert to deal with India war-time economic problems has force, but does not in my view outweigh considerations : (a) thai-transfer of financial responsibility in this country to Indian hands cannot be postponed, indefinitely and (.&amp;) that if we are to wait until all is plain sailing weare, in fact, deciding on indefinite postponement. Financial problems will beno easier at the end of the war.2. I believe Mudaliar, who has long political and administrative experience and has served both as Commerce and Supply Member, has the required capacity,and would be satisfactory Finance Member, given suitable technical underpinningby official of status superior to Secretary to Government who would be interposedbetween him and Secretary. I can find such official here but am prepared to-consider His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s nominee.
