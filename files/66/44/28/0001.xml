The transfer of capacity within individual firms from Ministry of Supplywork to work for the Admiralty and Ministry of Aircraft Production continue during September and October and resulted in substantial increases in thenumbers employed on work for those two Departments over and above those shownin the foregoing Table. It is safe to assume, firstly, that the figures given aboveunderstate the decrease on Ministry of Supply work, and, secondly, that by theend of October the net increase on M.A.P. work since the 1st April exceeded theallocation of 115,000 for the period the 1st April to the 31st December.Other Essential Industries and Services.6.
