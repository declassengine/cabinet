THIS DOCUMENT IE THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1943.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (43) 584.26th December, 1943.WAR CABINET.EEPORT FOR THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER 1943 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES and mandated   TERRITORIES.1. Mr. Leighton McCarthy, Canadian Minister at Washington, has beenpromoted to ambassadorial rank, and Mr. Ray Atherton is to become theUnited States Ambassador to Canada. Mr. McCarthy will thus be Canada&apos;first Ambassador, and Canada will be the first Dominion to be represented in aforeign country by an Ambassador.2. Speculations on the possibilities of a general election continue to appear in the press, and the recent actions on the part of the Government, of extending the leave of soldiers and of lifting the ban on some forbidden organisations,seemed to point to an early election. However, it is probable that the Governmentis too much occupied with labour and other problems to undertake an electionfor some time.3. Colonel Drew, who is now on a visit to this country to establish an agency for the Province of Ontario, is gaining great popularity in Ontario byhis announcement regarding his Governments intention to revise the educational system in the Province, and to improve labour and housing conditions. InQuebec there is still little indication that the Provincial election is likely to takeplace, and it is probable that it will be deferred until early in the spring. It isunderstood that the Quebec Government proposed to set up a new branch of theDepartment of Trade and Commerce, the main function of which will be toincrease trade. To this end, it is reported that an office of the Quebec IndustrialCommission will shortly be opened in London.4. Increasing attention is being paid to economic and post-war problems.The Prime Minister&apos;s Parliamentary Assistant, Mr. Brooke Claxton, made a speech before the Thirtieth National Foreign Trade Convention in New YorkCity, setting forth Canada&apos;s attitude towards foreign trade after the war, and towards international co-operation in general. Canada&apos;:s support was pledged tothese principles, and she looked to the removal of world fear, to lowered worldtariffs, and to the establishment of machinery to maintain international monetarystability and to provide credit.5. Mr. Bracken, the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, speakingat Lethbridge, outlined his Party&apos;s agricultural policy, which included Federalco-operation with organised farmers, increased farm prices, and the developmentof land, health and transport services.6. At the Canadian Chamber of Commerce Annual Meeting two importantResolutions were passed. An establishment of a special Ministry of Reconstruc-tion in the Federal Government was advocated, and it was resolved that theDominion-Provincial discussions should be resumed for the purpose of clearrestatement of financial and constitutional relations.THE DOMINIONS.Reportby the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.
7. The strikes continued, after the promise had been given that a RoyalCommission would investigate grievances, since the miners felt resentment thatthey had been called out to support John L. Lewis&apos;s light against the Governmentof the United States. The Order-in-Council forbidding miners to strike andimposing a fine has not met with success, as it is realised that powers already existed under the Defence of Canada Regulations. Following the strike in thewestern coalfields, the Federal Coal Controller has ordered that dealers may notdeliver coal except on certain defined conditions.8. The McTague report on the position of labour has not yet been published,but the author of the Report said that present wage controls had provedinadequate, and that Canada had been singularly backward in dealing with theproblem of collective bargaining. Following the conference on labour relationsheld between the Government and the Provincial authorities, the Minister ofLabour, Mr. Mitchell, announced that complete agreement had been reached onthe principles of collective bargaining. A Government statement on the subject is expected to follow.9. As a result of feed failure in Eastern Canada, a crop failure on thePrairies, and a serious farm labour shortage, fewer hogs had been produced.The Minister of Agriculture announced a new bacon and ham agreement withthis country, under which Canada will supply 900,000.000 pounds in two years.10. The Fifth Victory Loan campaign reached a total of $1,363,000,000,and the number of individual subscribers was higher than in previous campaigns.11. Major-General Vanier, the Canadian Minister to the Allied Govern-ments in the United Kingdom, has been appointed Canadian Representative tothe French National Committee of Liberation at Algiers. After General Vanier&apos;departure, and pending the appointment of a new Minister, M. Pierre Dupuy willbecome Charge d&apos;Affaires of the Legation to the Allied Governments.Naval, Military and Air Activities.12. During most of November, although the advance of the 8th Armycontinued steadily, * progress was slowed up by strong enemy resistance and alsolargely on account of weather conditions. The Canadians, fighting their wayforward from the Torella area, reached the line of the Vasto-Forli road nearCarovilli on the 13th. Torrential rain about this time washed away several roadbridges and produced conditions which seriously retarded the forward advance,since any movement off the roads was, in most places, impracticable. Nevertheless,by the third Aveek of the month the Canadian division had reached the next road,which follows roughly the course of the Sangro River, and had cut it just north of Atelata. After this phase, the situation on the Canadian sector of the8th Army remained almost stationary until the end of the month, although further on the right the forward movement continued as the result of a full-scale assault on the German main Sangro defences on the night of the 27th/28th.13. During first half of November weather over the United Kingdom and north-West Europe was unsatisfactory for large-scale air operations, but towardsthe latter half of the month conditions improved greatly and the Canadian BomberGroup was very active. Berlin was attacked four times and numerous other objectives were bombed with good results. - Twenty-four enemy aircraft were destroyed by R.C.A.F. squadrons during the period and other losses were inflicted on the enemy in the form of locomotives, trains, coastal craft, canal barges andlorries attacked in enemy-occupied territory by low-flying aircraft. A coastal command Sunderland of No. 422 Squadron made a very determined attack againsttwo U-boats during which the Sunderland was badly damaged and forced to comedown in the sea; five survivors of the aircraft were picked up by a naval vessel.The three Canadian Wellington Squadrons which were loaned to the north african Air Force have now returned and. are re-equipping with heavy bombers.No. 427 Squadron (Halifax V) flew 83 bombing sorties against main Germanobjectives including Berlin and lost only one aircraft. Losses of R.C.A.F. home-based aircraft during the month were 32 bombers, ten fighters, three Sunderlandsand two Wellingtons.Combined Food Board.14. Mr. G. S. H. Barton, Deputy Minister of Agriculture, has beenappointed deputy to the Hon. J. G. Gardiner (the Minister of Agriculture) asCanadian representative on the Combined Food Board at Washington. It isthought that Mr. Gardiner is unlikely to be able to attend more than occasionalmeetings, and that Mr. Barton will be the usual representative.
AUSTRALIA.15. Newspapers all over Australia welcomed the appointment of the duke of Gloucester as Governor-General in succession to Lord Gowrie. They expressedthe deepest satisfaction that Australia will at last share with Canada and with south Africa the honour of having a Royal Governor-General, and acclaim theappointment of the brother of the reigning monarch as Governor-General of a dominion as a reaffirmation of the supreme importance of the Crown as the centre of the British Commonwealth and of Australia^ place and prestige within that commonwealth. Mr. Curtin, speaking of the appointment, said &quot;Australiansdeeply appreciate His Majesty&apos;s action. All in this country will look forward with affectionate and loyal interest to the arrival in Australia of His royal highness.16. After his return from his meeting with General MacArthur, Mr. Curtinissued a statement emphasising the difficulty and delicacy of the operation ofa nation changing its policy from the defensive to the offensive. Mr. Curtin,quoting the Cairo Declaration of &quot; the resolve to bring unrelenting pressureagainst their brutal enemies by sea, land and air,&quot; said that his discussions withGeneral MacArthur had particular reference to the sentence referring to &quot; pro-longed operations.&quot; The Cairo Declaration tells the Australian people quite clearly that there is no short cut to victory in the Pacific.17. After Service votes had been counted in the Western Australianelections, the Labour party gained three more seats, and the position in theLegislative Assembly is that, out of 50 members. 30 are held by the Labour Govern-ment. The practical result of the election has been to restore Labour to the samestrength as when it gained office in 1933. The Premier (Mr. Willcocks), andMr. MacDonald, the Leader of the Opposition, have both been returned. one new member of the Cabinet will be elected to succeed Mr. Millington, the Ministerof Works, who is retiring.18. The Minister of the Interior of the Commonwealth Government announcedthat a conference of Commonwealth departmental representatives is to be held inthe very near future to consider the question of immigration to Australia afterthe war. Surveys will be made to determine the maximum influx of population which Australia might expect to carry after the war, and the countries in whichthe most suitable types of emigrants might be obtained.19. The Federal Cabinet, by appointing a sub-Committee on ConstitutionalPowers, is considered to have taken the first step towards a referendum in themiddle of next year, on the question of extending the Federal Government&apos;s powers in matters considered vital for post-war reconstruction. After a special Consti-tution Convention last year of representatives of the Commonwealth and Statesheld at Canberra, it was agreed that the necessary additional powers in relationto post-war reconstruction should be granted by the States to the Commonwealth.Accordingly a draft Bill for enactment by the State Legislatures was agreed upon,but this Bill has been amended by some of the State Parliaments and not enacted by Tasmania. Mr. Curtin, however, announced that, unless the substance of theCanberra agreement is carried into effect in all six States, he considers that a referendum would be necessary.20. A Secondary Industries Commission within the framework of theDepartment of Post-War Reconstruction has been set up. Its task will be to review war-time development, with special reference to Government factories, andto recommend a policy and plans for development.21. In order to meet the acute shortage of domestic servants, the man-powerdirectorate will begin immediately to call up suitable single girls between the ages of 18 and 35 for domestic service.22. The Federal Government will probably pass legislation early in the newyear to establish a scheme for free medicine and other pharmaceutical benefits forthe public. This is regarded as the first instalment towards national schemescovering all medical services^23a. The Fourth Liberty Loan was over-subscribed with a total of  126million from a record number of 560,000 subscribers.
Naval, Military and Air Activities.23. Since the last report two new mine-sweepers have been launched forthe Royal Australian Navy and a Frigate has been commissioned.24. Owing to the present organisation of Divisional Cavalry Regimentsbeing unsuitable for jungle warfare conditions, a certain number of them havebeen reorganised, as dismounted units in the form of Divisional Cavalry (Com-mando) Regiments each consisting of two Cavalry (Commando) Squadrons.25. The British Services Mission, under Major-General J. S. Lethbridge,which arrived in Australia from the South Pacific Area towards the end ofOctober, has been carrying out an extensive tour in the South-West pacific area.26. An Inter-Services Demobilisation Committee has been establishedwhose duties include (i) production of a provisional basic plan covering the demobilisation of the Royal Australian Navy, Australian Military Forces, and royal Australian Air Force; (ii) Planning of Inter-Service and Servicemachinery required for demobilisation and developing such plans in accordancewith approved policy.27. The Royal Australian Air Force has now taken over responsibilityfrom the Australian Military Forces for disposal of unexploded enemy bombs on R.A.A.F. establishments.28. A cable has now been laid from Cape York, Australia, to the new guinea coast North-West of Port Moresby and was expected to be open forsignal traffic by about the end of November.29. Experiments have been successfully conducted in moving horses by air transport in anticipation of the movement by air of pack transport com-panies of the Australian Army Service Corps in New Guinea.30. Total United States forces with South-West Pacific Area at the endof November, including Air Corps and Anti-Aircraft Units, was 283,109 all ranks.NEW ZEALAND.31. With reference to a statement in the United States of that country&apos;sneed of post-war bases in the Pacific and naval ports in Australia and NewZealand, the Acting Prime Minister said that no discussions have taken placeon this, but New Zealand would at all times be willing to discuss, with Australia,the United States, the Netherlands and Great Britain, the question of mutualuse of bases to provide economic transport and maintain security.32. The Prime Minister has been ill in hospital for several weeks. He isnow convalescing.33. Simultaneously with the publication in the United Kingdom of theWhite Paper on Reciprocal Aid, the New Zealand Government issued a state-ment comparing the value of New Zealand&apos;s reciprocal aid about  25 millionN.Z. up to the 31st October with the value of Lend-Lease supplies received about  47 million up to the 30th September.34. The United Kingdom press delegation has received a warm welcome byall the newspapers, and prominence is given to statements by members of the delegations emphasising the United Kingdonrs intention&apos; of making themaximum contribution to the war against Japan.35. Mr. Beno Roberts was sworn in by the Governor-General as a memberof the Executive Council and Minister of Agriculture and Marketing.Naval, Military and Air Activities.36. At the beginning, of the month the 2nd New Zealand Division had arrived in Italy from Egypt and had established its headquarters at Taranto.During most of the month the Division was being fitted out with vehicles and tanks and was completing its training in the &quot; Heel &quot; area of Italy. On the 20th the6th New Zealand Infantry Brigade came into line on the left of the 5th Corps
near Perano, while remaining under command of the Eighth Army, and startedpatrolling across the River Sangro following day. The 5th New ZealandInfantry Brigade came up on the left of the 6th on the 21st. By the 27thcrossings over the River had been reconnoitred in preparation for the mainEighth Army attack which took place that night. The New Zealand Divisionattacked on the axis Perano-Orsogna, remaining under the direct command ofGeneral Montgomery; the attack was effectively supported by large numbersof aircraft, and by the 30th, in spite of fierce enemy resistance, the Eighth army had broken deeply into the main portion of the enemy positions.37. Members of the Lethbridge Mission attended meetings of the New-Zealand War Cabinet.38. R.N.Z.A.F. Squadrons in the Pacific area are serving for six weeklyperiods in rotation in Guadalcanal, Espiritu Santo and in reserve in Fiji or NewZealand.39. During the period combat squadrons in the Pacific area destroyed13 enemy aircraft for the loss of one.40.   The strength of the R.N.Z.A.F. in all spheres is now over 42,000.SOUTH AFRICA.41. In a speech at the Nationalist Party Conference at Stellenbosch,Dr. Malan drew an analogy between the present prospects of the nationalist party and its progress after the last war, when it was able to capitalise on post-war discontent and eventually to achieve power. He expressed conviction thatthe Nationalist party had adopted the right attitude towards the war. Anotherspeaker, Mr. Bremer, said that an increasing number of people outside theNationalist party were beginning to realise that the welfare of the country layin the establishment of a republic, and Mr. Swart appealed to the Afrikanerparty to rejoin the Nationalists. Mr. Strydom, the Transvaal Leader, assuredhis audience that Great Britain&apos;s days as a great Power were numbered. Atthe end of the Conference it became clear, that the Nationalist party now basedits hopes on the decline of Britain as a world Power, and post-war dissatisfaction with the administration of the Smuts&apos; Government.42. The result of the Provincial elections, described in last month&apos;ssummary, has given great satisfaction to the Governments supporters and causedcorresponding disappointment in Nationalist circles.43. The Ossewa Brandwag has formed an Afrikaner labour front in anattempt to obtain the support of Afrikaner workers, mainly on the Rand. It isalso increasing its efforts to persuade soldiers that it will protect their interestsafter the war.44. Dissatisfaction over food control confusion is growing daily, and. inthe absence of Field-Marshal Smuts in London, the Cabinet has been strongly criticised for its lack of drive and constructive action. Public feeling is expectedto receive outspoken expression in the Parliamentary Session next January.Price control organisation is also being attacked for the ineffectiveness of itsmeasures, in view of sharp new rises in the prices of clothing and householdrequirements. The shortage of houses has become acute, and Mr. Lawrence.Minister of Social Welfare, has issued a warning that billeting may be necessarywhen the Army is demobilised.Financial and Economic.45. During the course of the visit of Field-Marshal Smuts to this country,agreement has been reached with him on the long-standing question of thefinancial arrangements for Union land and air forces operating outside SouthAfrica. The broad effect of these arrangements is that the Union Governmentwill reimburse to the United Kingdom Government  35^ million in respect ofthe cost of equipment and maintenance of these forces up to,the latter part of1943. The settlement also provides for cash payments from the Union Govern-ment in future at the rate of  1 million per month towards the costs incurred by the United Kingdom Government in connection with the Union Land forces and the S.A.A.F. squadrons operating outside the Union.
46. Speaking in the Dail on the 11th November, Mr. James Dillon, againcriticised Eire&apos;s policy of neutrality. He said: &quot;The United Nations arewinning this war without our help. T have not hesitated to say that we shouldhave helped them because 1 conceived that it was in that way our duty lay. Ibelieve it was our duty to render them the same assistance that Portugal has seenfit to give. I think that for all time that will be held against us as a mistake.&quot;Mr. Dillon went on to say that he wanted to see Britain and the Commonwealth ofNations win the war. &quot; I realise,&quot; he said, &quot; that there are old prejudices in thecountry which might be used to confuse peoples&apos; minds if exploited byunscrupulous persons at this stage of our history, and to make people foolishlydesire that any country should win this war so long as it was not Britain.&quot;47. Speaking of relations with the United States, Mr. Dillon said that a false picture was being presented to the mass of the American people, a picturesavins; that the Irish did not care what became of them.48. In reply, Mr. de Valera said on the 16th November that it was untrue tosuggest that Eire was ungrateful to the United States for her help in the past.President Wilson&apos;s ambitions for the championing of small nations had not been realised. Thej^ could not blame America. Mr. de Valera went on to say that &quot;theyhad taken their stand on neutrality courageously and deliberate^, and that if anyattempt should be made by any State in the post-war period to vent anger upon them, they would have to face it with the same courage with which they had facedother crises.&quot; Mr. de Valera referred to the propaganda campaign, which hesaid had been in progress ever since Eire declared her neutrality. Mr. Dillonwas going out of his way to fasten upon them the charge of ingratitude. &quot; I sayhere to-day that Ireland has not forgotten the generosity of the American people.It is true of me personally that I have closer personal connections with the UnitedStates&apos;than with anywhere except this country, and it is probably true of a largenumber of our people.&quot; Mr. de Valera said that their small nation was aware that equipment for modern warfare was far beyond its possibilities when theyadopted the policy of neutrality. They knew perfectly well that it was a seriouspolicy that might well involve them in War. Neutrality was not a cowardly policyif they really meant to defend it. Other nations had not gone crusading into thewar until they were attacked.49. In another speech Mr. de Valera expressed his views on the press andalso on proportional representation. While admitting that &quot; liberty of criticismin the fullest sense was necessary,&quot; he said that destructive criticism wasdamaging to the interests of the country as a whole. This criticism he described as a &quot; bad habit,&quot; &quot; democracy&apos;s dilemma &quot; and &quot; one of the weaknesses and evilsof the democratic sj^stem.&quot; He then said that the newspapers during the last ten years had carried out unjustified criticism, which was aimed at shaking thewhole foundation of the State and of democracy itself.50. Mr. de Valera said that under proportional representation, parliament was the nation in miniature. When there were only two parties that workedvery well, but it became very serious where a number of parties, for sectionalinterests, were prepared to combine against a measure which was designed for thegeneral good. The trouble with proportional representation was that while it didgive in the Dail a better picture of the nation, it was not able to give to theGovernment that support which made for stability.51. Answering questions in the Dail on the 4th November, regarding theposition of Eire diplomats in Italy, Mr. de Valera said : &quot; The Government of theKing of Italy presided over by Marshal Badoglio is the Government with whichthis country has diplomatic relations. In the course of his duties in relation tothe protection of our citizens in Rome, our Minister there is to communicate withthe de facto authorities in that area, but this does not involve diplomaticrecognition.&quot;52. Speaking in the Dail on the 17th November, Mr. Cosgrove said that thecost of living in Eire was 284 points in August 1943, having risen from 173 inAugust 1939, while comparative figures in Britain were 199 and 156 respectively.&quot; By comparison,&quot; he said, &quot; the balance of wisdom, judgment and discretion inthe conduct of public affairs seems to be across the water. The appetite forinflation was more pronounced in Britain, but the cost of living had advanced in eire.   No effort had been made in Eire to prevent the cost of living from soaring.&quot;
INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.53. Internal conditions in India remained quiet and interest in economic problems continued to predominate. Comment on events in the Mediterraneanarea was unfavourable to Great Britain in contrast with persisting admirationfor Russian achievements, and the defeats at Leros and Samos evoked misgivings.Uneasiness, particularly in Moslem circles, was felt over French action in the lebanon, and for their attitude in this matter His Majesty&apos;s Government got somecredit.54. The political situation to all appearances was more stagnant than ever.Speculation on probable developments in the new Viceroyalty was checked byLord Wavell making it clear that his immediate concern is to deal with food andkindred problems arising out of the war. A meeting of the Moslem league council was held during the month; no sensational note was struck in theproceedings.55. The appointment of an Australian High Commissioner in India, theoffer of food by Field-Marshal Smuts and the arrival of a number of food shipstended to reassure India of the sympathy of the Commonwealth in her difficulties.External and Frontier Relations.56. Afghanistan. In the course of a long and friendly interview with His&apos;Majesty&apos;s Minister, the Prime Minister emphasised his desire for the most friendly relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India,which, he said, was the wish not only of the Afghan Government, but of the people as a whole. It was clear that fear of Russia remains an obsession with him, andhe appeared still to be hankering after some assurance of support against Russia,though he admitted that any form of Pact or Treaty was out of the question inpresent circumstances.57. On the&quot;i4th November the Prime Minister had a sharp attack of angina,pectoris. He was ordered complete rest, and at the end of the month was reportedto be progressing favourably.58. Some disturbance was reported among the tribes in the southern province. A visit by the War Minister to the Province effected a temporarysettlement, but he had to return to Kabul on hearing of the Prime Ministersillness.59. Steps are being taken by the Afghan Government to amend certainrecent Trade Regulations, regarding which we had earlier made representations on the ground that they would discriminate against Indian traders.60. Signor Quaroni, the Italian Minister, who is needed by his Governmentfor work elsewhere, proposes to travel home shortly in company with SignorAnzilotti, the Commercial Attache, whose removal has been demanded by theAfghan Government. The Legation, which has now little to do, will be left incharge of Signor Crescini, the Archivist.61. Another member of the German Legation, Rassmuss, the CommercialSecretary, will be leaving shortly under safe-conduct. He, like Witzel, had been closely concerned with Axis subversive activities.62.   Mrs. Katsube, the British wife of the Japanese Minister, decided after all to accompany her husband back to Tokyo.63. North-West Frontier.-*T)x\.v&apos;mg the second half of the month a recrudescence of gang activity was reported, mainly in North Waziristan road protection troops being attacked on two occasions and suffering casualties.Otherwise the frontier remained quiet.84.   Persian  ^/-^Developments in the Lebanon situation were watchedwith close interest.- 65. A congratulatory message on the surrender of Italy was sent to thePrime Minister by the Sheikh of Qatar, and there has been general satisfactionas a result of the continued Allied successes in Italy and Russia.
66. The Sheikh of Bahrein has been asked to provide certain facilities inhis territory for the United States Air Corps, such as a pipe-line, tankage, a wireless station and accommodation for personnel.  He has raised no objection.Economic.67. Food Situation (Bengal). The main features of the situation in regardto food in India during November have been : (i) the progress made with the aid of the Army, both in transporting food supplies from Calcutta to outlyingcentres and in its distribution to the more remote villages from those centres;and (ii) the beginning of the main rice harvest in Bengal and elsewhere in India,of which the present indication is that the acreage for all India is at least4 million acres larger than last year, though there is no official estimate as yet ofthe outturn. Conditions for the crop are favourable and there is now everyprospect of a large crop in Bengal, which has been unofficially estimated as likelyto bring the total rice supplies of the Province to 11 million tons against7 million tons last year. Arrangements are being made by the Bengal Govern-ment, in consultation with the Food Department of the Government of India,for the procurement of the winter crop. Since there is insufficient time for aGovernment organisation to be set up, purchase is to be mainly in the hands offive principal agents under the direction of a Committee, on which Governmentis to be represented. In order to relieve the pressure on the Bengal markets, theGovernment of India has agreed to supply from outside Bengal the needs ofCalcutta city and its industrial suburbs, of which the requirements are estimatedat 650,000 tons for the year. Plans for the rationing of Calcutta are going-forward, and it is hoped to bring the scheme into operation some time in December.During the first fortnight of November there was a considerable fall in the numberof starvation cases admitted to the Calcutta hospitals to 2,072 from 3,151 in theprevious fortnight. Deaths among these cases were 1,024 against 1,413, whilethe number of bodies disposed of by Police and unofficial committees in Calcuttawas 1,267 against 1,719.68. Food Situation (other areas). In other difficult areas in India, BombayDeccan Districts are reported as having received a well-distributed monsoon withthe result of a normal millet crop. The position there is generally easier. InTravancore and Cochin the position is difficult and will remain so during december until the Madras rice crop begins to move out. The next harvest doesnot begin before mid-January. State-wide rationing is being introduced inTravancore, but in both States the rice ration is small, and has to be supplemented by other grains and tapioca. The Government of India expect to improve supplies during 1944 and the States will receive about 20,000 tons of imported wheat.Special arrangements will be made for rubber plantation labour. In Madras therice and millet position is now generally satisfactory. Nearly all the faminecamps have been closed and the labourers are now employed on normal agricul-tural work. Rationing in Madras city is successful and is to be extended totowns in Malabar and to certain districts.69.   Elsewhere in India the position^ gives no particular ground for anxiety.70. Imports of Food. At the end of September the War Cabinet approved the shipment to India of 80,000 tons of wheat and up to 130,000 tons of Iraqibarley. Of this quantity 57,000 tons of wheat and 15,000 tons of barley had arrived up to the end of November and practically all the remainder of the pro-gramme is due to be loaded by the end of December. The War Cabinet have alsoapproved the shipment of a further 100,000 tons of wheat from Australia beforethe end of February 1944.71. At the end of October the Canadian Government offered the Governmentof India 100,000 tons of wheat on mutual aid, provided that shipment could bemade from Western Canadian ports. As, however, wheat can be shipped toIndia from Australia in under half the time and therefore with much greatereconomy of shipping, it is uncertain when this offer can be implemented.72. Bengal Cholera and Malaria Epidemics. The famine in Bengal hasbeen followed by serious outbreaks of cholera and malaria. In October deathsfrom cholera in the Province averaged 5,349 per week and in the first week ofNovember they were 4,464. The Army is assisting in the provision of doctors and medical equipment and a mass inoculation campaign is being instituted. There isa shortage of drugs generally in. India, as their supply suffered seriously from theshortage of shipping for Indian ports in 1942. and the early part of 1943,
Energetic steps have been taken since September to improve the position andthere is in any case no shortage of cholera vaccine, which is manufactured inIndia, or of quinine, of which India has adequate supplies to last her into 1946.There are, however, local shortages in some districts in Bengal owing to distri-butional difficulties.73. Coal Production. There has been a serious fall in coal production.Against a target of 2 -14 million tons per month, production in October was only -85 million tons and November and December estimated production is only -60 and 1-90 million tons respectively. This is due to labour being short offood and being drawn away from the mines in order to harvest their crops orto accept more attractive employment in military works. It is hoped that pro-duction will recover in January. Meawhile, supplies to Indian industries havebeen cut, Indian railway coal stocks are falling and it has not proved possible tomake any coal available for shipment to the Middle East. The appointment ofan experienced organiser from the United Kingdom to co-ordinate all aspectsof the Indian coal problem, including production, labour, miners&apos; food supply,transport, distribution and Government purchases is under discussion with theMinistry of Fuel and Power.74. Communications. Mr. Inglis and Colonel Appleton, who were selectedto advise the Indian Railway Administration on traffic operation, have arrived inIndia and have started work. Meanwhile, under pressure from the United states military authorities and the South-East Asia Command, the Government of india have agreed to hand over to American control the northern section of the Bengaland Assam Railway. United States railway troops will be employed for thepurpose75. Some congestion has developed at the port of Calcutta, owing to thebunched arrival of ships from North America, and some civil cargo is being diverted to other ports for the time being. This congestion is probably only temporary, but may recur. The limited capacity of the port presents a consider-able problem in view of the burden likely to be thrown upon it.76. Indian Internal Air Services. The aircraft at present used by theIndian internal air services will shortly cease to be air-worthy. If they cannotbe replaced the Indian companies will cease operations and the R.A.F. transport command would have to take over, so far as possible, the routes which theyoperate. This would be wasteful of personnel and organisation and an attempt is going to be made by the Air Ministry to obtain an allocation of suitable aircraft from the United States. Many aspects of the war effort would be embarrassed ifIndia&apos;s internal air services were appreciably cut down.77. UNRRA. The UNRRA Convention was signed on behalf of theGovernment of India by their Agent-General at Washington, who also representedthem at the subsequent meeting of the Council at Atlantic City. The Governmentof India accepted only with considerable hesitation the formula proposed for the calculation of the contributions due to UNRRA from participating governments,i.e., 1 per cent, of their national income in 1942/43, on the ground that thisoperated unreasonably in the case of a country like India with a low income per head of population and which is herself suffering serious domestic distress. Theformula was modified to provide for special cases such as India&apos;s and there was general recognition at Atlantic City that India could not be expected to makea contribution at the full rate.78. There has been some agitation in the United States, led by Indianelements there, for the extension of the scope of UNRRA to cover distress inIndia. The object of this agitation was probably to imply distrust of the ability of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India to deal with thepresent situation jn Bengal. It is likely, to make it less easy for the Governmentof India to secure ratification by the Indian Legislature of the UNRRAConvention.79. Scientific Research. Professor A. V. Hill, M.P., is visiting India asa representative of the Royal Society, in order to advise the Government of india on the organisation of post-war scientific research.
Naval, Military and Air Force activities.80. R.I.N. The following vessels were completed in India in October1943 :-Two 105-ft. Motor Mine Sweepers. ;One Fairmile.Five 72-ft. M.Ls.81. H.M.I. Sloops Sutlej and Jumna have been operating with theMediterranean Fleet throughout the recent operations. Sutlej took part in theoperations at Cos.82. Military. The control of operations in Burma passed from theCommander-in-Chief, India, to the Supreme Commander, South-East AsiaCommand, on night the 15th/16th November.83. Italy. Indian Troops form part of the striking force of the8th Army in Italy, and have taken a prominent and successful part in theoperations on and across the River Sangro against the German Winter Line.84. Burma.- In Arakan persistent, but unsuccessful, attempts have beenmade by the Japanese to dislodge us from our positions on the Mayu Ridge.Enemy casualties are believed to have been considerable, while ours were negligible.85. In the Chin Hills area our Levies have evacuated Falam and Haka underpressure from a small enemy column. The Japanese have launched -a small-scaleoffensive in the Fort. White area where their attacks have now been held, thoughour forward troops have been withdrawn from Fort White itself.86. In the Hukawng Valley patrol clashes have occurred between chinese troops trained in India and the Japanese. There has been little activity in NorthBurma.   The garrison of Fort Hertz has been reinforced.87. Air. Flying conditions generally have further improved, and therehas -been a marked increase in the scale of our air offensive, including nightbombing. The heaviest night concentration was on Akyab, which was bombedon five successive nights with excellent results. Airfields and railway yards havebeen attacked. Successful dive-bombing attacks have been made in support of our forward troops. Low-level fighter attacks have been made over a wide areaagainst road, rail and river communications and enemy troops and installationswith good results. There has been in consequence a notable decrease in small crafton rivers.88. The regular coast.and sea patrols have been carried out. A submarine was attacked and probably damaged by a Catalina off the South-West coast ofIndia. Photographic reconnaissance was widespread.. 400 tons of supplies were dropped.89. The U.S.A.A.F. made a number of attacks on airfields in the Myitkyinaarea, causing severe damage. Akyab town, Rangoon and Toungoo were also successfully bombed. The Rangoon River was mined. Many attacks were madeon communications and bridges, half the Loilaw Bridge being destroyed..90. Enemy air offensive operations in Burma have been few. Imphal andPalel airfields were unsuccessfully attacked, though some casualties were causedincluding civilians. Reconnaissance aircraft have been active, particular attention being paid to Imphal and Chittagong, while Calcutta was also covered.91. General: Communications. An earthquake on the 23rd/24th Octobercaused minor damage to the Assam Railway entailing some temporary restric-tion of traffic.92. Work continues on repairs to roads and railways in the Damodararea (50 miles North-West of Calcutta). The breach in the Damodar River is notyet closed though every effort is being made to do so. There is thus still a riskof further damage if rain falls heavily.93. A.A: and P.A. Defence. In view of the changed situation in regardto the threat to India, the scales of protection required have been revised and,in some instances, reduced. It has been decided that P.A.D. measures are onlyrequired in Bengal, Assam, Bihar and Orissa and parts of Madras.94. Health and Morale. Sick rates continue to be satisfactorily low.Morale is generally good and is high on the Eastern frontier.   British troops
are not convinced that repatriation of the fighting services is being organisedas equably and efficiently as it might be and apprehension as to what will happenwhen the war in Europe finishes is on the increase.95. Indian troops still feel strongly that an increase of pay should begranted to meet demands caused by the high cost of living, and are apprehensiveabout the effect of high prices and shortage of food on their families. In the punjab, cultivators are making large profits, and many Punjabi soldiers are showing a desire to go back to the land.96. Food distribution. The organisation of the distribution of food bythe Army as well as the repatriation of destitutes from towns is now developing.Some improvement in the Travancore food situation is reported.97. P.O.W. During October 507 Italians were sent to Australia for workon the land.98. Repatriation. The figures of British troops due for repatriation have proved to be unexpectedly large. It is anticipated that all men with six years&apos;service overseas will be repatriated by the 1st May, 1944.99. Recruiting. The intake both for the Army and the Indian Air Forcedropped considerably in October, while the R.I.N. showed little change. It isnot clear yet why this drop has occurred, though it is considered that insistence on higher standards is probably a major reason. Gurkha recruitment is most satisfactory and Mussulman recruitment has improved since the Ramzan fastfinished.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.100. Occupied Burma. The chief events of this month were the GreaterEast Asia Conference held in Tokyo, at which Ba Maw represented Burma,and the establishment of Subhas Bose&apos;s &quot;Provisional Indian Government &quot; in burma. Japanese propaganda suggests that the conference was intendedpartly as a counter-blast to the Moscow meetings, and the Declaration published on the second day contained only the usual &quot; co-prosperity &quot; themes. Ba Maw&apos;sspeech emphasised the gratitude to Japan felt by all &quot;free&quot; Asiatics andstressed the economic self-sufficiency achieved by Burma with Japanese help.101.   The economic difficulties with which  &quot;independent&quot;  Burma hasbeen faced may be alleviated by the completion of the railway into Siam whichmay allow the export of some of Burma&apos;s rice surplus or other products and the&apos; import of a certain amount of consumer goods which have been in short supply -THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &apos;&apos; Colonies &apos;&apos; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Food Supplies.102. East Africa. The favourable preliminary weather reports noted inmy report for October have unfortunately not been confirmed by later reports.It now seems certain that the short rains in East Africa have again this yearbeen a failure and in order to carry the country over until the next season&apos;scrops are due to come in in September, the East African authorities have had toask for 100,000 tons of cereals to be imported between now and the end of August.25,000 tons are required as soon as possible and at latest before the end ofFebruary. These demands have been put before the Ministry of Food and theMinistry of War Transport and means of meeting them are now being urgently-   [26613] &apos;.&apos; c 2
1 oj zexamined. The fact that over half the total quantity of 100,000 tons is required if possible in the form of maize (this being the customary diet of the East Africannative) is an additional difficulty as I am advised that the only available source of maize at the present time is the Argentine and shipments from the Argentineto East Africa are extremely difficult to arrange.103. Mauritius. Stocks of flour and edible oil are at present satisfactory.A further shipment of 7,000 tons of flour from Australia has been arranged forDecember. The Island has, however, been experiencing a shortage of proteinfoods, particularly meat and pulses which has been causing the Governor greatconcern. Pulses were formerly obtained from India, but this source is now cutoff and alternative supplies have to be sought from Madagascar and Australia.Meat is mainly imported in the form of cattle on the hoof from Madagascar.The principal obstacle to the maintenance of these supplies has been the lack ofa suitable small steamer. The Governor has asked that two small vessels shouldbe put at his disposal to maintain the trade between Mauritius, Madagascar, the oil Islands and the Island of Rodrigues. but it has hitherto been found impossibleto allot him more than one such vessel. The possibility of allotting a secondvessel to him early next year is now under examination with the Ministry ofWar Transport.104. Ceylon. Shipments of flour and wheat from Australia are being-effected according to programme and have enabled stocks of these cereals in ceylon to be maintained at a satisfactory level.105. The future outlook with regard to supplies of rice is less certainowing&apos; to the fact that future supplies are dependent upon the outcome of thenegotiations with the Egyptian Government for the acquisition of the new crop.These negotiations are now proceeding. It is hoped, however, that the fullprogrammed quantity of 10,000 tons wnll be shipped during December.Cotton Piece-goods.106. The maintenance of adequate supplies to the Colonies of consumer goods, of which cotton piece-goods are the most important, in order to ensurethe continuance of high levels of production of the colonial products which we need for the war effort continues to cause me concern in view of the increasing-shortage of such goods. Supplies of cotton textiles at existing levels from theUnited Kingdom and India will together fall considerably short of total estimated colonial requirements, and on present assumptions there seems no prospect of any substantial increase of supplies from either country. Indeed,there is every prospect that supplies from India will diminish rather thanincrease. Negotiations have been proceeding with the American authorities witha view to obtaining an increased contribution from the United States towardsworld needs of cotton textiles, but so far these have led to no definite assurances of increased supplies for the Colonies.Production in West Africa.107. The Assistant Under-Secretary of State in charge of the EconomicDivision and- the Marketing Director of the West African Produce Control board have recently gone to West Africa for the purpose of explaining the method and scope of the operations of the Board and to obtain the co-operation of allconcerned, particularly with regard to the increased production of oil seeds and vegetable oils. An endeavour to obtain the views of those concerned as to thelines on which control, purchase and disposal of commodities, in which the Board.are interested, might be developed in the future will also be made.Copra, Graphite, Cinnamon from Ceylon.108. Mr. E. Leach, the Commissioner for Commodity Purchase, Ceylon,paid a short visit to the United Kingdom during November for the purpose of discussions regarding the arrangements for the purchase of these commodities from the Colony by the Ministry of Food.JRubber and Tea from Ceylon.109. Mr. P. Saravanamuttu, the Ceylon Rubber and Tea Controller, is ona visit to this country to discuss price and production policy for these twocommodities over the next year or so, and kindred matters.
^Commodities from Jamaica.110. The Food Controller and Commissioner of Exports and Imports,Jamaica, also came to this country during the month for discussions with theColonial Office and the Ministry of Food. Among other things decided upon .was an increase in the price of&quot; bananas guaranteed by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, in order to provide funds to local producers for replanting the plantationsso as to ensure an adequacy of fruit now that the shipping position is graduallypermitting the resumption of exports to&apos; North America,Defence.West Indies.111. September Report, paragraph 67. On the 2i8th October the UnitedStates Deputy Chief of Staff informed Field-Marshal Dill that it was intendedto transfer approximately 340 Puerto Rican troops to Jamaica and 500 toAntigua to relieve a corresponding number of continental troops at those places.Objections had been raised in April this year to the transfer of Puerto Ricansto Jamaica, but it was felt that there were not sufficient grounds on which HisMajesty&apos;s Government could press them. No difficulties are anticipated fromAntigua. Field-Marshal Dill has been asked to inform the United States Chiefsof Staff of this and to assure them that while our views are still unchangedregarding the objections to the transfer of Puerto Ricans to Jamaica, and we still hope Puerto Ricans will not be sent there, they can rely on the co-operationof the British authorities in the Colony if they decide for military reasons thatthe transfer must be carried out.Gilbert and Ellice Islamds Colony.112. This Colony consists of Ocean Island (the capital), the Gilbert Group,the Ellice Group, the Phoenix Group, and the northern section of the Line Islands all coral atolls except Ocean Island in the Central Pacific.113. The High Commissioner for the Western Pacific recently visitedHonolulu, and on the 10th September discussed with the American Commander -in-Chief the organisation of civil affairs on the re-occupation of the GilbertIslands. Admiral Nimitz has now expressed his substantial agreement with the record of the arrangements then made, which have been sent to us by the HighCommissioner. The more important provisions are the following : The Com-mander of the Marine Division will be the Supreme Authority; the british resident Commissioner will work under him. Civil Affairs, which include relief work, recruitment of labour, &amp;c, will be administered as far as conditions permitthrough the Resident Commissioner and British Administrative Officers. NewZealand will be responsible for the provision and transport of food, and medical and other Supplies, and distribution will be the responsibility of the resident commissioner. A labour corps will be organised as soon as possible after re-occupation of the Islands. United States currency will be used in the firstinstance, to be replaced, when convenient to the Commander, by British currency.Man-Power... 114. A conference of service and civil authorities in East Africa has justreviewed the African man-power situation. Owing to the paramount importanceof maximum food production, and in order to meet the labour requirements for essential production industries such as sisal and pyrethrum, the estimated maxi-mum number available for military recruitment in 1944 for all the services hasbeen reduced, from 40,000, the estimate of a few months ago, to 16,000. All these will go to the Army. The Naval requirements referred to in paragraph 69 of the september report will be met either from Mauritius direct or, more probably, from existing East African units, whose numbers will be replaced by the recruitment ofan equivalent number of Mauritians into the African Auxiliary Pioneer Corps(East Africa). R.A.F. requirements will be met by loan from the AfricanAuxiliary Pioneer Corps (East Africa).Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.115.   Local affairs tended to distract attention from the war.An announcement was made in Parliament on the 10th November about theextension of the period during which immigration into Palestine will be permittednp to the White Paper figure of 75,000.   This has provoked little comment from
either Arabs or Jews, the interest in it having been swamped by the Lebanesecrisis. The Jewish attitude has been an ungracious acceptance and the Arabreaction has been negligible.116. Though discussions continued in some Arab political circles on themeans by which Palestine Arab participation in Arab unity talks could be bestarranged, nothing concrete emerged. Attention was focussed later on events inthe Lebanon, which evoked deep feeling against the French, accompanied by anappeal for intervention by His Majesty&apos;s Government.117. Mr. Ben Gurion resigned from the Chairmanship of the jewish agency Executive towards the end of last month, and this continued to be a majorcause of political activity and surmise. An article in the Jewish Press and a subsequent report of the meeting at which the resignation occurred made it quite clear that the fact that partition was again under discussion was assumed to becorrect, and that this issue formed the basic bone of contention between theWeizmann group and the extremists headed by Ben Gurion.118. During the night of the 31st October, some 20 members of the Sterngroup (Jewish terrorist organisation) detained under an Emergency Regulation,escaped from Latrun Detention Camp by means of a tunnel 176 feet long, con-structed from their hut to a point outside the perimeter fence. The circumstancesof the escape are under examination by a court of enquiry.119. It was reliably reported to the Security authorities that certaindeserters from the Polish Army were harboured in the Jewish Settlement atRama Hakovesh, and moreover that at this settlement was a training camp for a unit of an illegal armed organisation, and that illegal arms were concealed, in thesettlement. The settlement was accordingly searched on the 16th November by a combined force of British Police and troops. The Police encountered violentopposition from the settlers, the nature of which prevented them from carryingout their lawful duty to the full. It was impracticable to ascertain whether therewere any Polish deserters, although the quantity and nature of equipment foundsubstantiated the existence of a training camp of an illegal armed organisation.No arms cache was located. In order to secure the withdrawal of the rear-guardthe Superintendent of Police in charge was compelled to fire two revolver shots atthe settlers&apos; legs, wounding one of them in the leg, but not seriously. Another ofthe settlers has since died from head injuries. Considerable tension was causedamong the Jewish community by the publication of an. illegal communique inthe Hebrew Press of the 18th November, and protest meetings were staged in TelAviv on the 20th November, which culminated in an attack on the District Com-missioner&apos;s Office. The Office was set on fire. The fire was quickly brought under control, and the crowd was dispersed by the Police, but a youth waswounded by a shot fired by a civilian from a nearby roof. Casualties were elevenpolice and twenty-two civilians. None of them were serious, with the exceptionof the youth who was shot.120. Apart from the rather serious incidents mentioned above, public security was satisfactory, and armed banditry mentioned in reports for recent months decreased during this month.121. Recruiting figures dropped still further below the low level reportedin recent months.  No Jews enlisted in the infantry, and only five Arabs.122. The cost of living remains very high, the index figure being 239. Thevegetable and fruit marketing scheme mentioned in last month&apos;s report met with increasing success, and was mainly the cause of a decrease in the index from 243.Non-co-operation by Jewish producers persisted during the early part of themonth, but with dwindling zeal due to dissension within the camp and the approach of the peak period of production.Jamaica.123. On the 16th November members of the subordinate staff of the Railway,Public Works and Postal Departments went on strike. The principal grievanceappears to have been that there has been undue delay in the presentation and consideration of the report of a Committee appointed to consider the pay of the subordinate staff of Government Departments.124. The men returned to work on the 19th November, and there is little doubt that the short duration of the strike was largely due to the patience andtact with which a difficult situation had been handled by the local Government.
125. The necessary action has been taken to expedite the consideration ofthe Committee&apos;s report&quot; both in Jamaica and in this country, with a view to meeting if at all possible the wish of the staff concerned to receive before christmas at least an advance on account of salary increases resulting from theCommittee&apos;s recommendations.Fiji. -126. Sugar Dispute. The Report of the Commission of Enquiry was published on the 8th November. It examined in detail the cane farmers&apos; claimto an increase in the price of cane on the grounds of the increases in the costs ofliving and production as a result of the war. The Commission found that theincrease in the price of cane since 1939 had in fact kept pace with the aggregateincrease in costs of living and production.127. In reply to the Report, the extremist leaders issued a pamphlet which,in the Governor&apos;s view, made it clear that the basis of war-time increases in living and production costs had been, from the first, merely an excuse for a determinedassault on the Colonial Sugar Refining Company&apos;s supposedly excessive profits.128. After publication of the Report, cane cutting increased in some districts, but there is no sign that the main body of the growers have changedtheir attitude.Mauritius.129. Dr. Clyde, my adviser on war-time food supplies, left this country by air on the 27th November for Mauritius, where he will spend about five weeks.He will also visit Seychelles, Ceylon and East Africa.Social Services.130. A committee under the chairmanship of Lord Rushcliffe has beenformed for the purposes of advising upon the training of nurses for the Colonies.A motion.British West Indian Airways.131. Towards the end of October information was received that Mr. Yerex,who held approximately 60 per cent, of the shares in British West Indian Air-ways, had arranged to sell to American interests, not only 100 per cent of thestock of T.A.C.A., his Central American Company, and 50-9 per cent, of Aerovias,Brazil, his Brazilian Company, but also 40 per cent, of the shares in british west Indian Airways. There was nothing in this arrangement which was contrary to the letter of the requirement that 60 per cent, of the shares of british west Indian Airways should be in British hands, but it would have left Mr. Yerexwith the balance of power in the Company and in a position to control it in association with his American friends.132. As it is clearly not in British interests to allow the only British airservice in the West Indies to pass under American control it was necessary totake early steps either to ensure continued reliable British control of british west Indian Airways or to provide an alternative British air service. In either case it would be necessary to arrange for the provision of small numbers ofBritish aircraft to ensure the continuance of an effective service. It has been ascertained that these can be made available from Canada.133. It was felt that the first course had both political and financialadvantages and the Governor of Trinidad was accordingly authorised to attemptto secure the co-operation of Mr. Yerex in the issue to the Trinidad Governmentof sufficient additional shares in British West Indian Airways to ensure thecontinued British control of the Company and also to enable the latter to acquire the new aircraft and equipment which are needed for the maintenance of theCompany&apos;s services.134. In reply to an invitation to visit Trinidad for discussions Mr. Yerexintimated that he could not do this before mid-December. Meamvhile information was received that he had undertaken to transfer to his American associates notoniy 40 per cent, of the existing shares of British West Indian Airways but also-40 per cent, of any future issue.   In these circumstances the Governor was
authorised to arrange for the issue of 2,000 shares to the Trinidad government without waiting for the discussions with Mr. Yerex who will thus be faced with a fait accompli. It remains to be seen how he will react to this situation. It maynot be entirely unwelcome to him since it provides him with a means of extricatinghimself from his present position without voluntarily breaking faith with hisAmerican associates.Aviation Conference, Johannesburg.135. The Union Government invited the Government of Southern Rhodesiato send a representative to attend an informal and exploratory conference onthe 9th December on the subject of post-war civil aviation. The Union Govern-ment intimated at the same time that they hoped that representatives of the east african Governments and of Northern Rhodesia would be able to attend. As no decision has yet been reached on post-war civil aviation policy and the colonial governments concerned are not yet in a position to enter into formal commitments-on the subject, arrangements were made for representatives of northern rhodesia and Nyasaland and of the East African Governors&apos; Conference toattend as observers.This proposal was unacceptable to the Union Government who have post-poned the Conference. As there had evidently been a misunderstanding I discussed the position with Field-Marshal Smuts before his return and it is nowhoped that the Conference will meet after Christmas. I made it clear that, in viewof the present uncertainty as to future civil aviation policy, it would not bepossible for the Colonial representatives to enter into any definite commitmentsat this stage. It is now proposed that when the Conference is held it should be attended by representatives of the East African Governors&apos; Conference and ofNorthern Rhodesia and Nyasaland who would not be restricted to the role ofobservers, and by an observer from the United Kingdom.
