THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1943./ 3 ASECRET. ^ Copy No.     o *W.P. (43) 576.20th December, 1943.WAR CABINET.ANGLO-AMERICAN DISCUSSIONS UNDER ARTICLE VII.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.1. I wish to associate myself with the plea put forward by the Minister ofAgriculture for a fundamental reconsideration, both departmentally and by theWar Cabinet, of the monetary and commercial proposals recently put forward by our representatives in Washington. We must make sure that we are not com-mitted irrevocably to long-range fancy schemes which are not likely ever to berealised fcut which, in the interval, may completely paralyse our power to makeany effective start in economic recovery.2. It seems to me essential that we should frankly face the following questions :* -(a) Are these proposals such that, from the point of view of this country,we can afford to carry them into effect or will be allowed by publicopinion to do so ?(b) Will they be endorsed by other Governments in the Empire and, if not,what would be the effect of our acceptance on inter-Imperial relations ?(c) What other countries, including the United States, are likely, when it comes to the point, to look at them ?3. Let me take first the prospective position of this country from the pointof view of our balance of trade. In 1938 we had an adverse balance of visibletrade of nearly  400 million, partially balanced by  220 million from foreigninvestments,  100 million from shipping and some minor invisible exports, leaving a final debit balance of  56 million. Our shipping has been seriously reduced and will have to face formidable American competition. Even if rates may be high for the first year or two we cannot be sure of a figure as high as that of 1938.Our overseas investments have largely had to be disposed of. In their place wehave outstanding in the hands of Empire and foreign countries over  2,000 million,likely, before the war is over, to be at least  3,000 million of sterling balances.In so far as these remain locked up as the reserves behind the currencies of sterling area countries we may have only interest to pay on them. In so far as theyare released on the market it will mean that we shall have to supply exports with-out earning a corresponding return. That fact, taken together with the loss of our foreign investments, means that, instead of an invisible export of  220 million, weshall have to face an invisible import of anything up to  100 million or even more.4. That looks like leaving us with a debit balance of at least  250 million,possibly over  350 million. Is there the slightest possibility of our coveringthis by increased exports, merely in consequence of some lowering of american and other tariffs, not to our exclusive advantage, but to all the worldunder Most-Favoured-Nation conditions ? Are we not bound to face thenecessity, for an almost indefinite period ahead, of the most drastic restriction of our imports&apos;? In the nature of things that must, come out of foodstuffs, ofwhich we imported  431 million in 1938, and manufactures, of which we imported 234 million. If we can cut out  200- 250 million out of these two items weshall still be left with a tremendous task in increasing our exports to make upthe deficit. Anyhow nothing short of drastic long-continued quantitative restrictions or really high tariffs can achieve even that indispensable minimum of reduction in our imports.[26593]V.-,&quot;    &apos; /     f&apos;i161
5. In the above I have made no allowance for the proposed reduction to a mere &apos;&apos; token &apos;&apos; of those Empire preferences with the help of which practicallyhalf our gross total exports have in recent years gone to the Empire&quot; If thoseexports are analysed by labour content, and if we add the fact that they werematched mainly by foodstuffs and raw materials in return, it would be safe tosay that the Empire trade was worth a great deal more to us than the trade ofthe rest of the world put together. How can we hope to retain the preferencesupon which that trade is so largely based unless we give preferences in return?In other words, I do not believe that there is any hope of this country&apos;ssustaining its present standard of living except on the basis of effective protection,of the vigorous development or at least maintenance of existing Empirepreferences, and of special treaties with individual countries prepared, in effect,to circumvent the Most-Favoured-Nation clause and discriminate in our favour,as the Scandinavian countries have done. Whether that is achieved by tariffs,by quantitative restriction or by State purchase is a mere detail. In any case itis quite incompatible with the proposals we have put forward at Washington.6. When it comes to Empire countries I cannot imagine India or Australia,for example, coming into the proposed Commercial Union and submitting theirtariffs to a fixed overhead rate or having their freedom limited by the decrees ofan international committee. If Empire countries stand out, are we then, accordingto the Washington proposals, to be obliged to impose higher duties on them thanon foreign countries which join the Commercial Union? Is Imperial preference to be superseded by anti-Imperial discrimination ?7. To turn to the scheme for an international monetary union under which,even in the relatively flexible British proposals, we are only to be free to vary ourexchange rates with the rest of the union by 10 per cent, in ten years, that meansabandoning all real control over our internal price level, which is far moreimportant to us than any fixity of external exchanges. Is that something to whichwe can commit ourselves with no guarantee as- to what violent &quot;changes in the monetary situation may come about in the United States or elsewhere ? Willother countries in the Empire commit themselves ? Australia saved herself in1930 by dropping 20 per cent, below the gold standard and then dropping another20 per cent, with us when we came off. And what is, under these arrangements, tobecome of that sterling system which we have built up, which saved us in 1931and with the help of which we -have been able to finance this war ? I gather(W.P. 566, g 13 (iv)) that, under the proposed schemes, there are to be &quot;nodiscriminatory arrangements or multiple currency practices without the approvalof the Fund,&quot; in other words that our handling of the sterling system is to besubject to a majority vote of an international body.8. Whatever the merits or demerits of these commercial and monetaryproposals, it is certain that they would give rise to the most violent controversy,which, in the nature of things, would inevitably assume an anti-Americancomplexion. I can imagine nothing more calculated to upset any British Govern-ment, to create friction within the Empire or to impair Anglo-American relationsthan these proposals if it were conceivable that they will ever come to anything.9. Happily, quite apart from our own domestic and Imperial interests, itis difficult to think of any other major nation that will take these proposalsseriously. To a country like Russia they, of course, mean nothing. To imagine that the Russian Government will buy from abroad only on the strictest competitivelines without regard to commercial or political reciprocity, or admit foreign goodsif they are cheaper than Russian-made goods by the x of the proposed tariff ceiling,is just wishful make-believe. Will the ruined countries of Europe be able to afford to abjure the right to fix their own tariffs, employ exchange and other restrictions or forgo mutual preferential arrangements? Will France dream of )abandoning the preferential system in her Colonies ? Will China, any more thanIndia, welcome imports that could interfere with the vigorous stimulation of herindustries ?10. The fact is that this Article VII to which we have committed ourselves subject, fortunately, to the co-operation of the world generally represents a deliberate attempt to restore the mid-nineteenth century world of capitalist-individualist-internationalism. It aims at eliminating all national control of monetary and economic policy, of production and standards of life, in favour ofthe bygone economic philosophy which aimed at enabling every individual to buy
and sell, to invest and employ, to his maximum immediate profit regardless ofall social and national consequences, and on the same terms everywhere as the individuals of any other nation the system which Carlyle described as the&quot; bagman&apos;s paradise.&quot; That system appeals in America, as it did here a hundred years ago, to a peculiar blend of quasi-religious internationalist emotionwith a robust economic Imperialism. But the world at large has passed beyondit.   That Humpty-Dumpty cannot be put on his wall again.   *11. It may have been necessary for political reasons to agree to Article VII.It may even have been necessary to go through the pantomime at Washington ofsuggesting schemes to give it effect. But, having got that far, let us pause before we commit ourselves to the extent of tying ourselves up hands and feet, deprived of all power to set our house in order and get started on the tremendous businessof reconstruction, while waiting to find out whether there is going to be world,or even American, agreement to something that there is no reason to believe thatthe world, or even America, will really look at when it comes to the point.India Office, 20th December, 1943.L.
