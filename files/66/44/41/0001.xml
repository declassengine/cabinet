naval SITUATION.General Review.1. Ships of the Home Fleet covering a convoy to North Russia have sunkthe battle-cruiser Scharnhorst.Three of a force of German destroyers operating in the Bay of Biscay asescorts for blockade runners were sunk in a running fight with two ofH.M. cruisers. In addition one blockade runner has been sunk by coastal command aircraft.Shipping losses, all caused by U-boats, continue to be light.Northern Waters.2. : A convoy bound to North Russia, which was covered and escorted by ships of the Home Fleet, was shadowed by enemy aircraft on the 23rd and thetwo following days. At 0844 on the 26th, H.M. ships Belfast, Norfolk andSheffield made contact with the German battle-cruiser Scharnhorst about80 miles south-east of Bear Island. The Scharnhorst attempted to attack the convoy but was twice driven off by the cruisers. On the first occasion she was hit by the Norfolk. At 1300 she turned away and made off to the southwardat high speed chased by the cruisers, who maintained touch and reported hermovements throughout the afternoon. Meanwhile, the Commander-in-ChiefHome Fleet, flying his flag in H.M.S. Duke of York, with H.M.S. Jamaica(cruiser) and four destroyers in company, was moving up from the southwardto intercept. The flagship made contact with and engaged the enemy at 1620,obtaining one hit below the water-line. The Scharnfoorst immediately turned to the northward and then to the eastward and about 1830 it appeared that hersuperior speed would enable her to escape. Determined destroyer attacks byH.M. ships Savage, Sgumarez, Scorpion and the Norwegian Stord, followed by theMusketeer, Matchless, Opportune and Virago, headed her off, however, and inflictedtorpedo damage which reduced her speed and made it possible for the Duke ofYork again,to come into action. At 1929 the Scharnhorst was on fire and nearlystopped. She was torpedoed at close range by the Jamaica and sank at 1945some 60 miles north-east of the North Cape. Thirty-six ratings were picked upby the destroyers.During the action, H.M.S. Norfolk was hit aft and had a turret put out ofaction. Her casualties were six killed and five wounded. H.M. ships Sheffieldand Saumarez also sustained slight damage.   There were 20 casualties in theSaumarez.The convoy, consisting of 19 ships, has arrived intact in North Russianports. .. .Home Waters and North Sea.3. Coastal forces from Dover, on the night of the 23rd/24th, carried outthree attacks, in low visibility, on a large enemy ship from Boulogne which was proceeding eastward through the Strait under escort, One or more R-boats were severely damaged. Six of our M.T.Bs. sustained damage and there were26 casualties.On the same night eight E-boats approached the South Coast near St. AlbansHead, but were intercepted by Norwegian destroyer Glaisdale and two S.G.Bs.The encounter was inconclusive.H.M.S. Worcester (destroyer) wras mined off Yarmouth during the same night and was towed to port.The Dutch S/M 0.15 attacked a convoy of six ships south of Bergen on the26th and probably torpedoed one of them.North Atlantic.4. On the 23rd, an aircraft from the U.S.S. Card (escort carrier) sighted asuspicious ship, possibly the Osorno (6,951 tons), a blockade-runner homewardbound from the Far East, about 560 miles west of Ushant. On the morning ofthe 24th, aircraft of Coastal Command sighted an enemy force consisting of 10or 11 destroyers or torpedo boats in company with a cargo ship, 160 miles north-west of Cape Finisterre. Between 1200 on the 24th and 1350 on the 25th, a totalof 62 aircraft were despatched to attack this force, and it is probable that the cargo ship was hit. A photographic reconnaissance, on the 28th, showed theOsorno to be in the Gironde, apparently beached.
On the 27th, the German Alsterufer (2,729 tons), also a blockade-runner, wassighted on an easterly course by a Sunderland, 600 miles west of Ushant. Shewas later attacked by five aircraft, set on fire and left in a sinking condition.Sixty-five survivors were picked up by H.M. ships.On the 28th, Coastal Command aircraft made numerous sightings of a forceof 11 German destroyers some 800 miles south-west of Ushant. At 1335, these were intercepted by ELM. ships Glasgow and Enterprise (cruisers) and engagedin a running fight which lasted until about 1600. Two Narvik-cl&amp;ss destroyers(2,400 tons) and one Elbing class (1,100 tons) were sunk and others were damaged.H.M. ships Glasgow and Enterprise both sustained minor damage with eightcasualties, including two killed, in Glasgow. Air cover was maintained duringthe action by 28 Beaufighters. Later six Liberators (B. 24) attacked the enemy,but no direct hits are claimed.5. While engaged on anti-submarine operations on the 24th, some 400 miles north-east of the Azores, the U.S.S. Leary (destroyer) was torpedoed and sunk.Fifty-six survivors were rescued. H.M.S. Hurricane (destroyer), which went toassist, was also torpedoed and had to be sunk by our forces. There were12 casualties, including one killed and two missing.Mediterranean.6. The French contre-torpilleur Le Fantasque on the&apos; 24th intercepted;outside Spanish territorial waters, the Danish s.s. Nicoline Maersk (4,194 tons),which had sailed early that morning from Valencia. On being ordered to stop,the ship headed inshore and ran aground.An Italian tank-landing craft was mined and sunk on the 23rd in the harbour at Bastia.7. In the Adriatic, M.T.Bs. on the night of the 21st/22nd carried out a successful attack on the German (ex-Yugoslav) cruiser Dalmacija (3-4-&quot; &apos;1899), which was aground off Siiba Island (N.W. of Zara). H.M. ships Tyrianand Teazer two nights later shelled the island of Drvenik (west of Split), and alsosank a caique by gunfire.8. During the week ending the 9th, discharges at ports on the west coast ofItaly totalled 82,022 tons of stores, 3,808 vehicles and 19,492 personnel. On theeast coast 44,741 tons of stores, 3,126 vehicles and 37,281 personnel were discharged.Levant.9.   H.M. S/M Surf sank a ship of 3,000 tons off Lemnos on the 9th.0Pacific.10. U.S. submarines in the Pacific have recently sunk one destroyer, twojarge tankers, two medium-sized transports and seven merchant ships.Solomons.11. U.S. cruisers and destroyers on the night of the 23rd/24th bombardedairfields at Buka and Bonds with 7,500 rounds, causing many fires and explosions.Qn the same night, U.S. M.T.Bs. shelled coastal positions near Cape Moltke onthe west coast of Bougainville. On the 27th, U.S. cruisers and destroyers carriedout a bombardment of the Kieta area on the east coast of Bougainville.New Ireland.12. U.S. carrier-borne aircraft attacked Kavieng on the 25th. Onedestroyer and two large cargo ships were sunk. In addition one destroyer,several small cargo ships, many barges and an E-boat were severely damaged.New Britain.13. Prior to landings by U.S. Marines, beaches at Cape Gloucester werebombarded at dawn on the 26th by a U.S. task force. There was no oppositionat first, but aircraft later attacked landing craft at one beach...Reconnaissance of Rabaul on the 26th showed five destroyers, two anti-submarine craft, 30 cargo ships and 425 barges. ;/[26644] &apos; -   B
New Guinea. .14. M.T.Bs. on the 22nd in the Vitiaz Strait sank six northbound barges.They also sank one and damaged three laden barges which were southbound.Anti-Submarine Operations.15. Twenty attacks on U-boats have been reported, eleven of which were by ships and nine by shore-based aircraft. One of the attacks was made in theMediterranean.The U.S.S. Schenck (destroyer) possibly sank two U-boats on the 24th about450 miles west of the Bay of Biscay.Enemy Intelligence.U-Boats.16.   The number of U-boats on operational service is increasing.The dispositions in the N.W. Approaches appear to be the same as inrecent weeks and the main force is about 500 miles west of Ireland (R) spread overa wide area.Enemy Attack on Shipping.17. During the week, U-boats are reported to have attacked five ships, twoof which are known or presumed to have sunk. A U.S. tanker was torpedoed inthe Caribbean off Colon, but reached port and a ship in a West African coastalconvoy was sunk off Cape Palmas. In the Indian Ocean one U.S. ship was torpedoed.&apos; off the east coast of Arabia, another was torpedoed off the south-westcoast of India and a ship in convoy was sunk off the south-east Indian coast. ;Protection of Seaborne Trade.18. -During the week ending the 26th, 730 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these, 173 ships were in ocean convoys and 557 in British coastal convoys. Four escort carriers, one anti-aircraft ship, 53 destroyers and 95 sloops,cutters, frigates and. corvettes (including 21 U.S. destroyer escorts) were employedon escort duties.Three homebound ocean convoys, consisting of 84 ships and four outward-bound ocean convoys, consisting of 89. ships, arrived at their destinationswithout loss.British Minelaying.19. Mines were laid, by surface craft off the northern French coast. Aircraftlaid mines off the Frisian Islands and the Biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.20. Minelaying by aircraft is thought to have taken place on two nights of the week off the East Coast. E-boats are suspected of minelaying on one nightoff the South Coast.The mine totals are 4,615 ground, and 3,933 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.21. Throughout November three of the larger German ships engaged in the ore trade and one Spanish ship sailed regularly from Bilbao. Fifteen of thesmaller ships also sailed at regular intervals.Merchant ships totalling 25,000 tons and tankers totalling 30,000 tons sailed from Genoa to Marseilles and adjacent ports during November, probably as the outcome of events in Italy.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)Nevel Sector.22. The Russian advance has continued in very difficult country. Therailway between Vitebsk and Polotsk Was cut on the 27th and Russian forces are closing in on Vitebsk itself from the north and east.
Central Sector. ,23. In the areas of Mogilev and Zhlobin local fighting has taken place, butthere has been no change of position.Kiev Sector.24. Up to the 23rd the Germans continued to attack between Korosten andBrusilov but made no headway against strong Russian resistance. The weatherat that time in this sector of the front was unfavourable for heavy fighting owingto alternating frost and thaw, but the ground has now apparently hardenedsomewhat, although the weather was still reported to be changeable on the 28th.The Russians were able on the 24th to launch an attack on a 50-mile front, whichhas already made considerable progress in the area east and south-east OfC Zhitomir. The Russians have thus in a few days regained a. considerable partof the ground lost during the repeated German counter-attacks of the precedingsix weeks.   On the 29th the Russians announced the capture of Korosten.Dneiper Bend.25. The Germans have been attacking in the area north of Kirovo and claimto have regained a little ground.Russian attacks towards Krivoi Rog and against the German - bridgeheadsouth of Nikopol have produced no territorial change. On the 19th the Russiansforced the Germans to evacuate the small bridgehead which they held across the dnieper opposite Kherson.General. .26. The Russians have made excellent progress in their attacks betweenNevel and Vitebsk, have resumed the initiative west of Kiev and have already made &quot;a considerable advance in this sector.Italy.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)27. In the Eighth Army sector the most notable feature of the past weekhas been the final capture of Ortona by the Canadians on the 28th after eight days of hard fighting, during which both sides used tanks. The advance is now being continued up the coast road and by the 29th the Canadians were two and a halfmiles beyond the town in very wintry weather conditions.Inland British and Indian troops have made further progress to a distance ofabout two miles beyond the lateral road, and are advancing on Tollo from thesouth and the south-east. Arielli has been reported empty, but the enemy were, onthe 28th, still bringing fire to bear upon our troops from a ridge to the west of the village. The New Zealanders have maintained contact with the enemy roundOrsogna.28. In the Fifth Army sector the French have attacked through the mountains to the south of Mt. Mare, where they have made some progress. Heavysnow and difficulties of supply are at present impeding their advance.On the 25th U.S. forces launched a local attack on the hills to the north-west of San Pietro and attained their objectives. The enemy is, however, stronglyentrenched around the mountain village of San Vittore.The British-held coastal sector has on the whole been quiet save for one sharpengagement at the mouth of the Garigliano on the 28th, when a strong enemy attack was repulsed after heavy fighting.   No ground was lost.29.   During the past week the enemy has shown no relaxation in his defensiveefforts and it seems that he will continue with his policy of using all Iris available resources to maintain his present positions south of Rome.   Some regrouping ofhis forces is now taking place which may result in mobile counter-attack forcesL      being available on both flanks.Yugoslavia.30. In the Sarajevo area Partisans have captured Rudo (50 miles south-east of Sarajevo), while fighting continues in Tuzla (50 miles north of Sarajevo).In West Bosnia heavy fighting is still in progress round Livno.The Germans landed on Korcula Island (off the Peljesac Peninsula) on the22nd and occupied the whole island after two days&apos; fighting.[26644] &quot;      -        :;,     b 2
The Partisans attacked an airfield near Zagreb blowing up a dump of 150tons of bombs.Sabotage attacks on the Zagreb-Belgrade railway and on other railways in north Yugoslavia have continued.Greece.31. A number of heavy engagements between Elas and the Germans havebeen reported in Macedonia, Thessaly and the Peloponnese.Burma.32. In the Arakan our patrols have operated to within 1,000 yards of theMaungdaw-Buthidaung road. The enemy appear to be holding positions about800 yards north of the road.There are indications that the Japanese may be reinforcing the Arakan front,and they are improving their coastal defences throughout the area.In other areas there has been patrol activity only.Pacific Theatre.New Guinea.33. The Australians have advanced a further eight miles and are now about22 miles north of Finschhafen.New Britain.31. On the 24th Japanese infiltrations forced the U.S. patrols at Arawe towithdraw from the airfield. On the night of the 25th/26th the Japanese madethree further attacks, which were repelled..At dawn on the 26th U.S. Marines landed unopposed on two beaches on CapeGloucester. Those on the western beach have consolidated their beachhead.Those on the eastern beach have advanced to within about one and a half miles of one of the Cape Gloucester airfields.Long Island.; 35. U.S. forces have also landed on Long Island, in the north-westernentrance to the Strait between New Britain and New Guinea.Solomons.36.   There has been patrol activity only in Bougainville.AIR SITUATION.General Review.37. Aircraft of Bomber Command made two night attacks on Berlin. by day, military objectives in France were heavily bombed.In the Mediterranean area bad weather greatly restricted operations.Allied bombers heavily attacked railways in Italy.Enemy small shipping in the vEgean was effectively attacked.A heavy scale of effort was directed against targets at Cape Gloucester andBorgen Bay (New Britain). Prior to the Allied landing on the 26th, enemy aircraft suffered severe casualties over New Britain.United Kingdom.38. In daylight three enemy aircraft made brief landfall, two over the start Point area and one over Deal. At night no enemy aircraft were reportedover this country.Home Waters.39. Apart from the attacks on enemy ships in the Bay of Biscay, whichare referred to under &quot; Naval Situation,&quot; Beaufighters made two attacks on enemy shipping off the south coast of Norway and, as a result, a 6,000-ton ship was torpedoed and left listing, a 1,500-ton ship was set on fire, a 2,000-ton ship was seriously damaged and three escort vessels were damaged.Off Boulogne, fighters and fighter-bombers damaged two ships of 1,000 and500 tons respectively.Beaufighters, patrolling in the Bay of Biscay, destroyed two He. 177.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 63 were despatched, laid 156 sea-mines in enemy waters.
Germany and Occupied Territory.Day. .      , .    ;     ,v:. &apos;40. Large scale operations were confined to the first two days of the week;the 23rd and 24th, when heavy forces were despatched against military objectives in the Pas de Calais and Cherbourg Peninsula areas. These targets were attacked by 1,064. aircraft (including 658 U.S. heavy bombers) which dropped1,899 tons of bombs and fired 120 rocket projectiles. Enemy opposition was negligible and Allied losses were only one Boston (A. 20) missing and two aircraft which crashed in this country. The 104 squadrons of fighters engaged on escortduty and diversionary sweeps operated without incident.Escorted Thunderbolt (P. 47) and Typhoon bombers attacked airfields atGilze Rijen, Brest /Guipavas and Morlaix.On Christmas Day, Typhoons operating over the Lorient area destroyedoneF.W.200.Night.41. Berlin was attacked twice during the week, first on the night23rd/24th when 315 aircraft dropped 1,216 tons of bombs and subsequentlyon the night 29th/30th when 628 aircraft dropped 2,237 tons. No photographicevidence is available but there is good reason to believe that both operations were successful, and the fact that the enemy reported the main weight of thefirst attack to have fallen towards the east and south-east of the city whichwere, in fact, the target areas, is in itself encouraging. Of the 1,091 aircraft dispatched, 35 are missing and two collided over this country.A total of 68 Mosquitoes, some of which were engaged in &apos;&apos; spoof &apos;&apos; attacks in connexion with the two larger operations, attacked Leipzig, Aachen, Duisburg,Dusseldorf, Cologne, Magdeburg and Leverkusen.Italy.42. Light and fighter bombers effectively attacked enemy defences, gun positions and communications in the battle areas. One of the heaviest attackswas made around Orsogna where many hits were made on roads and buildings.war hawks (P. 40) and Spitfires attacked several trains in this area and south of,Ancona; 16 locomotives and 28 trucks were either destroyed or damaged in these attacks.Portresses (B. 17), Liberators (B. 24), and medium bombers continued to makeheavy and effective attacks on enemy railway centres. At Rimini (58 miles north-west of Ancona) heavy bombers dropped 306 tons, and the railway centre was wellcovered; and at Bolzano 186 tons were released. At Vicenza (40 miles west ofVenice) a small tonnage of bombs was dropped; the Liberators (B. 24) engaged onthis operation encountered about 50 enemy fighters, of which 19 were destroyed,for the loss of 10 bombers. Railways in the Florence area were bombed -by119 Marauders (B. 26) and the railway centre at Pisa by 84 similar aircraft.Marauders (B. 26) also attacked Orvieto (60 miles north-north-west of Rome),dropping 49 tons, and Cecina (48 miles north-west of Grosseto) where 33 tons were released. South-east of Rome about 100 light and fighter bombers effectivelyattacked railway targets; medium bombers attacked viaducts east-south-east ofGenoa dropping about 60 tons; 69 Marauders (B. 26) effectively bombed bridgesand railway yards in the Italian Riviera at Imperia and Ventimiglia.The harbour and railway yards at Civitavecchia were attacked by 47 Invaders(A. 36); a 250-f t. vessel was set on fire and numerous fires were seen in the rail-way yards. The Rome airfields of Centocelie and north and south CiampinO&apos; were bombed by 101 Marauders (B. 26); a number of fires were seen among aircraft onthe ground and hangars and buildings were hit. Thirty-five escorted Liberators(B. 24) attacked the airfield at Vicenza (42 miles west-north-west of Venice); of30 enemy fighters encountered, one was destroyed for the loss of six Lightnings(P. 38).South of France.43. The Antheor viaduct 10 miles south-west of Cannes was attacked by33 Marauders (B. 26); 42 tons of bombs were dropped and hits are believed tohave been made on the approach to the viaduct.
Yugoslavia.44. Medium and fighter bombers attacked a wireless station, a ship of8/10,000 tons, a stationary ship and a schooner near Zara. Fighter bombers onoffensive reconnaissance of the Korcula Islands destroyed two locomotives.iEgean.45. Many successful attacks were made on caiques and other small vessels in the ^aegean by Mitchells (B. 25) carrying 75-mm. cannon, Baltimores (A. 30),and R.P. Hurricanes. The enemy has made considerable efforts by means of this small shipping to supply the Islands under his control. A total of 19 caiques were either sunk or damaged, a small escort vessel was set on fire, and a number ofbarges either destroyed or severely damaged. A 1,500-ton vessel, a 500-ton coaster,and two other ships, were bombed and machine-gunned. During some of these attacks many casualties were inflicted on enemy personnel. Beaufightersdestroyed an Arado 196.Russia.46. On the southern part of the front the weather is known to have beenbad and to have seriously impeded air activities, and although close support andharassing operations took place on some sectors, such activity is thought to havebeen spasmodic and dependent on the weather.Russian pressure and air predominance in the Vitebsk area continued to pindown the bulk of the German air forces on the Central and Leningrad fronts.For this reason it may be assumed that enemy opposition in the area west ofKiev was provided in the main by forces based within the Dnieper Bend.The long-range bomber force in this area, comprising some three hundredaircraft, could be switched to the Kiev sector of the front without a changeof base.Burma and India.47. In the Taro area in the North, the Kalemyo area of the Upper Chindwinand in the Mayu Peninsula, Allied light and fighter bombers maintained harassingattacks on enemy positions, ammunition dumps and. other objectives; about 400aircraft were engaged in these operations but no important results were reported.In Central Burma, 12 Mitchells (B. 25) attacked the oil storage area atMonywa (60 miles W.N.W. of Mandalay) and Lightnings (P. 38), in an attackon the airfield at Anisakan (20 miles E. of Mandalay), destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.Night attacks were made by a total of 49 Wellingtons on Mandalay, Toungoo,Sagaing and on the railway station at Ywataung (40 miles N. of Prome).Raids on enemy communications resulted in damage to seven locomotives,40 trucks and 26 small craft.An attack on Chittagong by 30 escorted, enemy bombers resulted in little damage and the destruction, by fighters, of six of the enemy for the loss of oneSpitfire.Siam.48. On the 21st, 29 Liberators (B. 24) effectively bombed the railway yards at Chiengmai and, on the night of 23rd/24th, a similar force attacked targets at Bangkok.China.49. Targets in the Tungting Lake area (125 miles S.W. of Hankow) were attacked by 21 medium bombers, and fighter-bombers in the same area sank a200-ft. ship.During raids, by a total of 47 Liberators (B. 24), on the White Cloud airfield at Canton and. a satellite airfield nearby, 28 enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat and, others damaged for the loss of one Liberator (B. 24) and one Kitty-hawk (P. 40).Off the coast, Mitchells (B. 25) sank two small ships and a gun-boat.The airfield at Kunming was attackd by 24 escorted enemy bombers whichdestroyed two aircraft on the ground.
Pacific Zone.New Guinea.50. A total of 172 escorted medium bombers attacked airfields and other objectives near Madang and Wewak, and the runways at Alexishafen. In Wewakharbour, two small ships were sunk and, in combat, 18 enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of two Mitchells (B. 25) and two Lightnings (P. 38) anda further four Mitchells (B. 25) crashed at base.Attacks by a total of 52 aircraft were made on coast defences north ofFinschhafen and on the jetty area at Bogadyim.New Britain Area.51. Between the 21st and 26th, the main Allied effort was directed against enemy camps, barge bases and defences in the Cape Gloucester and Borgen Bayareas; about 700 aircraft, of which approximately half were heavy bombers, were engaged in these operations from which no losses are reported. In addition,364 tons of bombs were dropped in direct support of the landing operations atdawn on the 26th.Three raids by escorted Liberators (B. 24) on Pabaul and its nearby airfieldsresulted in heavy losses to intercepting enemy fighters of which 69 were destroyed and 18 probably destroyed for the loss of 15 Allied fighters.Eleven attacks by enemy aircraft on our positions and shipping in the Arawearea and, in the latter part of the week, on similar targets at Cape Gloucesterand Borgen Bay also proved expensive and were, in the main, ineffective; Alliedfighters, of which six were lost, destroyed 117 of the raiders and probably destroyed a further 14.New Ireland.52. On seven successive nights, Catalinas (PBY) made small-scale attacks on airfields at Kavieng and, by day, medium bombers made two attacks on asuspected radar station at Cape St. George.In operations against enemy shipping in this area, one medium sized ship and one small ship were sunk, a large transport was hit, and another large ship and four barges were set on fire.Bougainville and Buka Islands.53. About 220 escorted light naval bombers made three attacks on gun positions and dumps on Buka Island, Sohana Island (in Buka Passage) and onthe northern part of Bougainville. Allied light and medium bombers also raidedKieta and a camp near Kahili.Mitchells (B. 25) attacked the seaplane base in Buka Passage and, in thesame area, 16 Liberators (B. 24) bombed Chinatown.Marshall Inlands. x&apos;\54. Between the 19th and 24th, a total of 100 Liberators (B. 24) and 49fighters attacked targets at Mili, Maleolap and Kwajalein and snipping in thearea. One large and three medium sized ships were set on fire and, at Mili, seven aircraft on the ground were destroyed. In combat, seven enemy aircraft were shot down; four Liberators (B. 24) and two Allied fighters are missing.COMBINED OPERATIONS.55.   On each of the nights of the 24th/25th, 26th/27th and 27th/28th, small; detachments of Commando troops carried out raids on the north coast of Franceand the Channel Islands.   Valuable information was obtained.   Some casualties were suffered, mostly in a raid on Point de Gravelines. . ..HOME SECURITY SITUATION.56. During the night of the 23r&apos; the Kent coast was bombarded in reply toour own batteries. At Deal two house, were wrecked, and at Dover a Chapel; atFolkestone damage was done to property.There were no other incidents during the -period.

In the daylight attack by the U.S.A.A.F. on the 13th Decemberthe majority of the bombs fell in the industrial district of Harburg and in the harbour area. In Harburg, which was the one district which had suffered little in previous attacks, the station was hit and considerable damage was caused to factories and housing.   Among the factories hit were Phoenix rubber works.Leverkusen. Photographs show that during the attack on the 19th-20thNovember two buildings of the I.G. Farbenindustrie A.G. were destroyed and four buildings severely damaged, including the analytical department and work-shop and the aniline dyes building. Several other buildings were slightly damaged.Stuttgart. Photographs taken after the attack on the 26th-27th Novembershow widespread damage, the most important item being very severe damage toworkshops, assembly shops and finishing shops in Daimler Benz A.G. (aero engines) at Untertiirkheim. Many public buildings have been affected, the AdolfHitler sports stadium has received a direct hit, and several buildings in and around the factory airfield of Stuttgart/ Boeblingen have been damaged.Additional information regarding the Daimler Benz works comes from aground source who states that, as a result of this attack, 50 per cent, of the workswas destroyed and that the remainder would be at a standstill for about ten days.
