naval SITUATION.General Review.,1. Convoys to and from North Russia have reached their destinationswithout interference.Aircraft of U.S. carrier task forces have successfully attacked -Japanesewarships, shipping, and aircraft in the Marshall Islands.An air raid on Bari has caused heavy shipping casualties.Northern Waters.2. A convoy of 15 ships has arrived in North Russian ports, and a home-ward bound convoy of ten ships from North Russia has arrived in Home Wallers.Both convoys were heavily escorted and ships of the Home Fleet covered their passage, which, apart from an attack on a U-boat by one of the escorts of thehome bound convoy south-west of Bear Island, was without incident.Home Waters.3. On the 5th H.M.S. Holderness (destroyer) was mined north-west ofCromer, but reached Harwich under her own steam on the following day.Mediterranean.4. On the evening of the 2nd a strong force of enemy aircraft attacked theport of Bari, dropping mines and bombs. Two ammunition ships were hit andblew up, starting fires on adjacent ships. Seventeen ships, totalling 71,507 tons,were sunk, three of which may be salvable, and six ships, totalling 17,244 tons,were damaged. Of the 17 ships sunk five were in ballast and the remainder had atotal cargo of 41,840 tons. H.M. destroyers Zetland and Bicester and the depotship Vienna were also damaged but are seaworthy. The total casualties are estimated to.be about 1,000. The bulk petrol pipe was pierced and-many firesin the harbour were still burning on the following day. Although comparatively little damage was done to port facilities, several days&apos; unloading capacity hasbeen entirely lost and a reduced capacity is inevitable for some time.5. H.M. destroyers Quilliam and Raider bombarded Durazzo on the night of the 30th/1st. On the 2nd, Quilliam and Loyal shelled targets in the Pescaraarea and damaged three bridges. At night they bombarded Ancona and Benedettoand also sank four schooners and damaged another. Queenborough and Raidersank a small ship in the central. Adriatic on the 3rd. On the 8th the German (ex-Italian) hospital ship Gradisca (13,870 tons) was intercepted by HM. destroyersTroubridge and Tumult north-east of Bari and escorted into Brindisi.6. On the night of the 1st/2nd Troubridge, Teazer and Paladin bombardedthe Minturno area in support of the Fifth Army.Levant.7. H.M. S/M Torbay, on patrol in the ^Fgean towards the end of November,sank a 3,000-ton escorted westbound ship off Samos and a 50-ton caique.The Greek destroyer A drias, which was mined and beached off Kalymnos onthe 22nd October, reached Alexandria on the 6th December under her own power.All the small craft which were used in the recent ^aegean operations have nowbeen accounted for.East Indies.8. On the 28th H.M. S/M Trespasser probably torpedoed a 4,000-ton shipbound south-east off the Nicobar Islands.An R.I.N. ship was slightly damaged during an air raid on Calcutta onthe 3rd. &apos; &apos;Pacific.9. U.S. submarines in Pacific and Far Eastern waters have recently sunk one large tanker and ten cargo ships..: On the 3rd, two U.S. M.T.Bs. sank one and possibly two barges, damagedtwo others, and probably torpedoed an unidentified craft south of Madang (new guinea).
On the 4th. two u.s.. M.T.Bs. destroyed seven rafts heavily loaded with provisions and ammunition, north of Finschhafen. Two U.S. destroyers bombarded enemy supply dumps and camps near Empress Augusta Bay(Bougainville Island).10. During heavy attacks by aircraft of U.S. carrier task forces atKwajalein and Wotje Atolls in the Marshall Islands 72 enemy aircraft were destroyed, two light cruisers, one tanker, and three cargo ships were sunk and atroop transport and two cargo ships were damaged. The TJ.S. naval forces were heavily attacked by enemy aircraft with torpedoes and bombs, but only one ship was damaged. Six torpedo-bombers were destroyed by A.A. fire of the U.S. ships.U.S. aircraft losses were light,     ,Anti-Submarine Operations.11.&apos; Only nine attacks on U-boats have been reported during the week, four of which were by shore-based aircraft, one by carrier-borne aircraft, and theremainder by surface craft.   None of the attacks were considered successful.Enemy Intelligence.12. Tirpitz, Scharnhorst and seven destroyers were seen in Altenfiord by russian reconnaissance on the 2nd.Reconnaissance of Toulon on the 1st showed that the daylight raid by U.S.aircraft on the 24th November had caused, the following damage : -The 6&quot; cruiser La Galissonniere, a large destroyer, a torpedo-boat, an escort vessel, a French submarine, a cargo ship, a small floating dock and a number ofsmall craft were sunk. The gate of one of the dry docks was destroyed and twocargo ships and several E-boats were damaged.Reconnaissances have shown that repair activity in the shipyards of Bremen,Gdynia, Hamburg and Kiel was considerably hampered between July and Octoberdue to bomb damage to docking facilities. Many floating docks have been damaged which will affect the completion and repairing of U-boats besidesdelaying repairs to cargo ships.U-boats.13. It has been a quiet period except for some activity in the Gulf of aden and off the U.S. eastern seaboard.Enemy Attack on Shipping.14. U-boats are reported to have attacked four ships, of which three are known to have sunk. A U.S. tanker in convoy was sunk south-west of Floridaand a Cuban ship was sunk off Cape Hatteras. Two ships were torpedoed offBritish Somaliland; one was sunk and the other reached Aden.Heavy shipping casualties sustained in the air raid on Bari are reported inparagraph 4.Protection of Seaborne Trade..15. During the week ending the 5th, 850 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these, 285 ships were in ocean convoys and 565 in Britishcoastal convoys. One escort carrier, 56 destroyers, and 111 sloops, cutters,frigates and corvettes (including 12 U.S. cutters) were employed on escort duties.Four homebound ocean convoys, consisting of 133 ships, and five outward-bound convoys, consisting of 152 ships, arrived at their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying.16. During the week aircraft have laid mines in the Kattegat, off the westcoast of Denmark, and off the Frisian Islands.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.17.   There have been no reports of minelaying during the week.Twelve ground mines have been destroyed off the eastern approaches toSpithead which remain closed. The area south-west of the Needles has beensearched so far with negative results and the approach is open.The mine totals are : 4,608 ground and 3,928 moored.[26557] 1 B
IS. On the night of the 29th/30th November, E-boats laid mines off Bastia(Corsica).. The port of Brindisi was reopened on the 30th.On the 2nd, one moored mine was destroyed off St. John&apos;s, Newfoundland.Enemy Merchant Shipping.19, During the period lst-15th November three ships totalling 7,071 tons were sunk in the Mediterranean and two ships totalling 1,000 tons were seriously damaged off the Dutch coast.There have been various movements recently of potential blockade runners in french Biscay ports which indicate that sailings might be made simultaneouslyfrom different places, and that these departures might coincide with the arrival of ships from the Far East. Three German ships are reported to have been atSaigon on the 15th October getting ready to sail for Europe, and these could by now have reached the Atlantic.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign. (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern and Central Sectors.20. The Germans have been attacking the Russian salient at Nevel and have repeatedly announced local advances, but they appear, in fact, to have made verylittle progress.On the 4th the Germans claimed that they had achieved a great defensivesuccess west of Smolensk against powerful Russian attacks lasting for some days,but the Russians themselves have made no mention of any attack in this area. Itis possible that the Germans have exaggerated the scale of fighting in order to beable to announce a success, a trick which has been used before by german propaganda.Mogilev-Gomel Sector.21. The Russians have gained a little ground S.E. of Mogilev and havealso continued their advance N.W. of Gomel to a point six miles from Zhlobin.The Russian advance in this sector is believed to have interfered seriously with german lateral communications, since the railway across the Pripet Marshes fromRovno to Baranowicze is frequently cut by partisans. Any large-scale movementof troops between the north and the south, has therefore to be made via Brest--Litoysk., ,:;Kiev Sector.22. After recapturing Korosten the Germans reduced their pressure againstthe Kiev salient, but on the 6th and 7th the Russians again reported attacks by large German forces north of Zhitomir and admitted the loss of some ground.Dnieper Bend.. 23. The Germans have been fighting hard to prevent the Russians fromextending their Cherkasi bridgehead as far as the important road and railjunction of Smela. They have so far succeeded in this, but they have not beenable to prevent another Russian thrust, in the Znamenka. area, from reaching therailway Smela-Znamenka, and so cutting the main German lateral communica-tions in. the Dnieper bend. The Russians are also closing in on Znamenka fromthe east.Elsewhere in this sector the Germans are still strongly resisting Russianpressure, and no important changes have taken place.The Russians reported on the 5th that they had driven out of the peninsulasouth of the Dnieper estuary a German force which had made a landing a fewdays previously.Crimea.24. On the 5th the Germans reported fighting in the Kerch area, whereconditions had been quiet for over a week. They claimed that the Roumanianshad made good progress in the attack against the bridgehead south of Kerchand that Russian attacks from the northern bridgehead had all been held.
These Russian attacks may have been made with the object of relieving thesouthern bridgehead, which has apparently never been as firmly established asthe more northerly one.The Germans later stated that the Russian bridgehead south of Kerch hadbeen wiped out on the 7th and about 2,000 prisoners taken.General.25. During the past week operations along the whole front have beenhampered by the weather. It is unlikely that any major operations will bepossible until the ground hardens, normally about the latter half of Decemberin the central and southern sectors. Meanwhile, however, the Russianscontinue to make local progress both in the Gomel sector and in the DnieperBend, and the Germans have been able to launch fresh counter-attacks againstthe Kiev salient, which remains a serious threat to all their forces between thatsector and the Black Sea.Italy.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)Eighth Army.26. The enemy is reacting strongly to our advance and has been counter-attacking constantly throughout the week. In spite of this and almost continualrain, progress has been made and our forward troops are now established along the River Moro with patrols over the river.By the 4th S. Vito Chietino, Lanciano and Orsogna were in our hands afterheavy fighting. Immediately to the south the 2nd New Zealand Mixed division was making good progress towards Guardiagrele, and further south had alsosecured the left flank of our advance by the occupation of Casoli.The following day the enemy threw the full weight of his counter-attack against Orsogna, and after bitter fighting, during which tanks and flame-throwerswere in action, the town was lost and our forward troops were forced to give up some of the ground they had gained.Two days later, on the 7th, our attack was resumed and started well. NearOrsogna, however, the New Zealanders came up against very heavy opposition,were unable to get up their supporting weapons owing to the state of the ground,and again had to fall back towards their start-line.On the coast the 1st Canadian Division relieved the 78th Division on the4th and quickly got patrols over the River Moro together with some tanks, which,however, soon got bogged down in the flooded meadows.In the central sector, activity by the 13th Corps has been confined to patrols and the 78th Division has moved into this area.Fifth Army.27. On the 2nd, U.S. forces, supported by a concentration of 820 guns,mounted an attack to clear the enemy from the Mount Maggiore feature whichdominated the road to Cassino. British forces also attacked from the south, andby the 7th all this high ground was in our hands except for small isolated enemy positions which were being quickly cleared up. On the 8th, a second attack, wasmade towards S. Pietro to clear the high ground to the north of the Mignano gap.Good progress has been made and U.S. troops are closing in on their first objective.Italian troops are in the line for the first time since their declared co-belligerency,and managed to make some advance before being held up by mortar fire.On the left flank British armoured regiments have been operating along theline of the River Garigliano and in several sharp engagements have inflictedheavy casualties on the enemy. The river, swollen by the recent heavy rains,has now flooded for some ten miles inland and has put a stop to all armouredmovement.Yugoslavia.28. The Germans have continued mopping up the islands north of SplitPartisans still hold the islands between Split and Dubrovnik.   &apos;On the 29th November, Cazma (35 miles east of Zagreb) was captured by-Partisans after heavy fighting in which 265 Germans were killed.[26557]b 2
On the 30th, Partisans attacked Travnik (50 miles north-west of Sarajevo)but were held off by strong German resistance helped by the G.A.F. Partisanscaptured the village of Trnovo, south of Sarajevo, which makes their encirclementof the city more complete.  All rail communications with the city are cut.In north Yugoslavia rail communications remain paralysed.A military mission from Partisan H.Q. has arrived in Alexandria.Burma.29. In Arakan our forces have made a slight advance between the MayuRange and the Kalapanzin River. On the 2nd they inflicted heavy casualties on japanese troops who counter-attacked our forward positions some four milesM.JS1. W. of Buthidaung.In the Hukawng Valley Chinese troops repulsed three Japanese attacks 20miles S.E. of Shingbwiyang, inflicting about 70 casualties for the loss of threekilled and ten wounded.New Guinea.30. &apos; Australian troops occupied Bonga, ten miles north of Finschhafen, onthe 30th November.   The advance continues northwards and westwards.Solomons.31. On the night of the 28th/29th November, TJ.S. troops landed onBougainville six miles south-east of Torokina. A Japanese counter-attack forceda withdrawal which was covered by surface craft, including destroyers. Thetotal Japanese casualties in the Torokina area up to the 25th November amountedto 1,149. Further advances have been made in the north-east of the EmpressAugusta Bay bridgehead.AIR SITUATION.General Review.32. Offensive operations by home-based aircraft were restricted by bad weather conditions, but heavy night attacks were made on Berlin and Leipzig.In Italy, close support was provided for our armies; enemy railway centreswere bombed and a heavy attack was made on Turin.In the Pacific, heavy attacks were made on enemy targets in New Guinea,New Britain and Bougainville.United Kingdom.33. The only three enemy aircraft overland were reported on the 2nd. one was destroyed by a Spitfire off the Orkneys, another was shot down by AA. gunsnear Dover, and the third was damaged by a Mosquito after dropping bombs nearLewes.Home Waters.34. Off the Dutch coast Hurricanes sank an armed trawler and an R-boat and damaged another R-boat. Beaufighters attacked a small convoy off the norwegian coast, damaging two small ships.Aircraft of Bomber Command, 60 of which were despatched, laid 164 sea-mines in enemy waters.   One aircraft is missing.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.35. Out of 545 bombers, comprising 451 Fortresses (B. 17) and 94 Liberators(B. 24), despatched to attack targets in Northern and Western France, 537abandoned task owing to thick cloud. The remaining eight aircraft droppedbombs on St. Nazaire, Cognac airfield, and the Merignac aircraft assembly plant(Bordeaux).One hundred and ninety-eight Marauders (B.-26) were despatched to attackmilitary objectives north of Abbeville, but owing to weather conditions, only 52attacked, dropping 91 tons of bombs with fair results.
Bostons (A. 20) and Typhoons dropped 35 tons on military objectives south-west of Cherbourg with good results, and Hurricanes fired 60 rocket projectiles atsimilar objectives near Hesdin (20 miles N.E. of Abbeville), bursts being seen inthe target area.A total of 41 Typhoons and Thunderbolts (P. 47) bombed three airfields inthe Low Countries.In all these operations, Allied fighters (which flew 1,622 sorties during theweek) and bombers destroyed 25 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed six and damaged two for the loss of.eight Fortresses (B. 17), one Liberator (B. 24) and twofighter-bombers. (These figures include 11 Do. 217 shot down over Holland by two squadrons of Typhoons without loss).Night.. 36. On the night 2nd/3rd, 401 aircraft, out of 458 despatched, attackedBerlin, dropping 1,688 tons of bombs in cloudy weather. There were, however, some clear patches over the target and a fair concentration of bombing was achieved which appeared to be towards the south and. south-east of the city.Many fires were started, which later spread over a wide area. Forty aircraft are missing from this operation.On the night of the 3rd/4th, the second large-scale attack was made onLeipzig, the first having been delivered on the 20th/21st October ; 1,452 tons were dropped by 449 aircraft out of 527 despatched. There was thick cloud over the target but the markers achieved a good concentration. A preliminary examina-tion of photographs taken by a Spitfire on the following day showed a vast con-flagration round the main railway station, but owing to smoke a detailedinterpretation was rendered impossible.   Twenty-nine aircraft are missing.A total of 25 Mosquitoes, one of which is missing, bombed Berlin, Duisburg,Bochum and Witten (near Bochum). A Fortress (B. 17) bombed Huls (nearDuisburg).Intruder aircraft (one missing) flew 30 sorties over Holland and Germany,and 47 aircraft dropped leaflets on towns in Northern France and North-west germany.Italy and South France.37. Close support was provided for our land forces on the battle front; thescale of attack was, however, somewhat diminished by low cloud and bad weather.On the front of the Eighth Army, bombers and fighter-bombers concentrated on defended areas and gun positions, and confirmation of the effectiveness of theraids was in some instances reported by the troops. The main attacks were madein the area of Guardiagrele and Orsogna; Mitchells (B. 25) bombed bridges atChieti and Pescara, and offensive reconnaissances were made against enemy roadmovement, resulting in the destruction of a number of M.T. vehicles.On the Fifth Army front, a series of particularly heavy attacks, by over 500aircraft, was made on gun positions at Cassino on the 2nd; similar targets were also bombed at San Ambrogio, the results of which were reported by the land forces to have been &quot;excellent.&quot; Invaders (A. 36) attacked roads and railway bridges in the Rome area and destroyed a locomotive, M.T. vehicles, and rolling-stock.At Orvieto, the railway bridge was bombed and probably damaged and therailway track was cut; sixty-seven Marauders (B. 26) attacked the railway yards at Arezzo with excellent results; Wellingtons dropped 83 tons on the railway centre at Pontassieve (nine miles E. of Florence) obtaining a good concentration on the yards, and Liberators (B. 24) made a good attack on the railway Centre atBolzano. In North-West Italy, 70 Marauders (B. 26) attacked railway bridges and obtained probable hits at Cecina (48 miles N.W. of Grosseto) and Aulia (eightmiles N.E. of Spezia).A total of 118 Fortresses (B. 17) dropped 354 tons on Turin; severe damage was caused to the ball-bearing works, to railway facilities, to the Fiat motor works and to other industrial buildings. A similar force of Fortresses (B. 17) attacked the U-boat pens at Marseilles; workshops, rolling-stock, tracks and buildings were damaged or partially destroyed; eleven enemy fighters were shot down.Offensive fighter sweeps were flown over the battle area and some moderateenemy opposition was encountered, as a result of which 16 enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of three Spitfires.&apos;A night attack was made on Bari Harbour by a substantial force of enemy bombers making liberal use of &quot;window &quot; throughout the raid (a device used by
the bombers to confuse radar). A number of vessels were sunk or damaged. FourBeaufighters &quot; scrambled,&quot; but no claim was made. Two out of three Me. 109attempting a reconnaissance the following day were shot down. Further details are in the Naval Situation.In the course of all these operations 40 enemy aircraft were shot down and33 Allied aircraft are missing.Yugoslavia and Albania.38. Sibenik railway centre and main unloading quay were attacked by48 Mitchells (B. 25), and war hawks obtained a direct hit on a small ship in the harbour; a ship at Rogoznica (25 miles W. of Split) was also hit. At Split,bombers dropped 48 tons on the railway centre and shipyards, and fighter-bombersmade two hits on a vessel of 4,000 tons. Nearly 80 war hawks (P. 40F) andInvaders (A. 26) carried out an armed reconnaissance of omission Harbour (12 miles.E. of Split), as a result of which a Siebel Ferry and a tug blew up and a ship of 100 feet was left on fire.Offensive sweeps were carried out by Spitfires over Albania and Corfu; oilcisterns were set on fire, a radar station, was attacked, 17 M.T. vehicles were destroyed or damaged, and two Ju. 52 and one Ju. 87 were shot down.Supplies were dropped for patriot forces.   .Greece and aegean&amp;n Sea.39.

Bombs were dropped at Salamis dockyards and Salonika. Manyanti-shipping, patrols were flown, as a result of which six caiques were destroyed or seriously damaged, a high-speed launch was left emitting smoke, a 150-footoiler was set on fire and two Arado 196 were destroyed on the water and one inthe air.Russia.40. Weather conditions were reported to have improved during the first partof the week, but. on the whole, unfavourable weather again prevailed over mostsectors of the front. In spite of this, the Russian Air Force continued to supportground forces whenever possible, especially in the area of Cherkasi, where enemycounter-attacks had been repelled, and in the Dnieper Bend, where damage wasinflicted on troops and transport in the course of Russian advances. In thecourse of close-support operations in the Dnieper Bend on that date, the russian air Force are stated to have destroyed 20 tanks, over 162 M.T., and two fueldumps, and to have shot down in combat 26 German aircraft.The railway junction of Apostolovo was bombed on the night of the30th November for the third night in succession; as a result of this operation, twcmilitary trains were claimed to have been blown up and 14 aircraft shot down in combat.Burma and India.41. -Successful bombing attacks were made on enemy railways and shipping.The railway centres at Mandalay, Sagaing, Moulmein and Insein (near Rangoon)were seriously damaged.

APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Germany.Munster.- Photographs taken on the 26th November after the U.S.A.A.F.attacks on the 5th and 11th November show that damage has been caused in theindustrial area south of the town. Among the ten factories damaged is oneengaged on aircraft repair and another manufacturing wire mesh products.In addition, one building of the town electricity works has been gutted andtwo barracks have been damaged, while there is also some scattered business and residential damage.Direct hits have cut the railway tracks near the junctions south of the goods station.France.Damage to Electric Switching and Transformer Stations on FrenchRailways. Two reports from reliable sources indicate that an R.A.F. attack on certain electric switching and transformer stations serving the P.O. Midi mainline from Paris to Tours on the 3rd October was remarkably successful.
