THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1943.SECRET Copy No.W.P. (43) 567.17^ December, 1943.WAR CABINET.REPORT ON THE FIRST SESSION OF THE COUNCIL OF UNRRA.Memorandum by the Minister of Food.I attach a background note on the first meeting of the Council of UNRRA-It may be of interest to my colleagues.The&apos;following is a summary.of the main points :  (1) The most important achievement of the meeting was that therepresentatives of 44 nations reached unanimous agreement on the scope of unrra and on the manner in which it should work, and that this agreementfollowed closely the lines laid down by the Cabinet in their instructions to me *(2) This result was, in my view, brought about by the strong Anglo-Americanlead that was given to the Council. This had been made possible by the carefulpreliminary work of the Minister of State during his visit to Washington inOctober.(3) Apart from the fact that neither Dean Acheson nor I took any stepwithout consulting the other, and that his team and mine worked as one, therewas the closest co-operation between the United Kingdom Delegation and those from the Dominions and India. The initial step in this co-operation was takenwhen I called a meeting of the Dominion representatives in Washington as soonas I received my instructions from the Cabinet. None of them at that time hadreceived any instructions from their Governments and. all were delighted when gave them a paraphrase of those which I. had received. In consequence, theDominion Delegations received from their Governments instructions similar tomine.(4) Before leaving Washington I had agreed with Acheson the suggestednames we should put forward for the Chairmanship of the various Sub-Committees through which the Council was to do its work at Atlantic City. three off these were by far the most important those on &quot; Scope of UNRRA,&quot; on&quot; Finance,&quot; and on &quot; Supplies.&quot; It was arranged, and subsequently agreed at Atlantic City, that I should be in the Chair of the first named, Acheson of thesecond., and Pearson (of Canada.) of the third. The three of us worked closelytogether and were thus in a position really to lead the work of the Conference.(5) The cardinal points in the instructions which I received from the Cabinet(W.P. (43) 461) were five :-(a) That UNRRA should be given a real task to perform, which would makethe Allied Governments feel that UNRRA was a useful instrument,but that at the same time it should not be magnified into a greatinternational authority controlling the economic life of the world;(6) That all the requirements for relief and rehabilitation supplies and services should be put through the established Combined Boards and supply machinery;(c) That restored local Governments should be encouraged to distribute.supplies themselves and generally to stand on their own feet as muchas possible;(d) That those restored local Governments who can pay for their require-ments should be encouraged to enter into direct relations with thesupply authorities; and(e) That UNRRA should be given power to approve or disapprove allrequirements from liberated territories before they are presented tothe Combined Boards.* W.P. (43)4.61;  see also W.M. (43) 143rd Conclusions, Minute 1.[26575] B
On all these points we achieved our objective. The first Resolution of theCouncil on the Scope of UNRRA describes in the terms we desired both the range of the supplies and services which fall within the terms &quot; relief and rehabilitation,&apos;&apos;&apos; and also the relationship between UNRRA and the CombinedBoard machinery. Before Atlantic City it was often argued that the CombinedBoard system would be so strongly attacked at the meeting that it would haveto be modified. In fact, the results have been the opposite and the combined boards have gained added strength.(6) The date at which UNRRA begins to take responsibility for relief inan area and the scope of its operations must be settled between UNRRA on theone hand and, on the other, the military authorities or the restored Government,as the case may be. To judge from opinions expressed at Atlantic City, theEuropean Allies will be jealous to prevent UNRRA functioning in any of their countries except with the explicit consent of the Allied Government concerned.(7) There is nothing in the UNRRA Agreement which prevents UNRRAfrom financing and distributing relief to the population of conquered enemy areas.It became quite clear at Atlantic City, however, that the European Allies willbitterly oppose any suggestions that UNRRA should operate in enemy countriesexcept for the purpose of preventing the spread of epidemics, of aiding allied nationals or of performing some other activity which can be shown to be of directbenefit to the liberated nations rather than to the enemy population.(8) Agreement was reached on a scheme for the provision of the necessaryfinance. This follows closely the lines indicated in my instructions as havinggreat political attractions and offering fewer practical difficulties than any alternative. The final form of the scheme, is a compromise between the general application of one formula all round (the contribution by each nation of freegoods and services up to 1 per cent, of its national income) and the alternative method of leaving it entirely to each country to determine the contribution itcan afford to make. The probable result will be that in practice the-United Statesand. the British Commonwealth between them provide over 90 per cent, of thefinance, the United States providing some five times as much as the UnitedKingdom.(9) My instructions referred to the desirability of avoiding discussion atAtlantic City of the actual supplies to be provided for relief purposes, butprophesied that Allied Governments would not allow the Council Meeting to disband without some discussion of the subject. The presentation to the Councilof the Report of the Inter-Allied Committee (which was inevitable) might have led to detailed discussion both of Allied requirements and of supplies to meet them, but we managed to have it presented and dealt with in such a way that this did not occur. This was done without offence to the Allies concerned and to the satisfaction both of the Supplying countries and of the Soviet delegates, who werespecially apprehensive of seeming to endorse the findings of the Inter-AlliedCommittee (a reference in it to supplies from Latvia seemed to have caught theeye of the Soviet delegate). Opportunity was taken to leave the Allies in no doubtof the difficulties of the general supply position, but the relevant Council resolu-tions dealt only with procedures for estimating and meeting requirements, andall discussion both of minimum needs and of available supplies was deferred.(10) We have succeeded in fitting UNRRA into the existing supply machine.But the usefulness of that machine may be seriously impaired if UNRRA itselfdoes not work efficiently. Lehman himself is competent and a pleasant man with whom to deal, but he has no experience of international organisation. Some ofhis lieutenants at Atlantic City did not fill me with confidence. I believe we shallhave to provide for his staff some men of experience who can help keep the new organisation on the rails. We can also make a significant contribution throughthe United Kingdom representatives on the various UNRRA committees. Inparticular, I attach great importance to the position of Chairman of the RegionalCommittee for Europe, a position which, after some interesting negotiations, wassecured for a representative of the United Kingdom rather than France. Thequality of our leadership in this work may well influence our future position inEurope.J. J. LI.Ministry of Food, W. 1,17th December, 1943.
Report on the First Session of the UNRRA Council.1. The resolutions unanimously agreed to by the forty-four nations at thismeeting indicate fairly clearly the measure of our success in securing agreement by the Council as a whole with the ideas contained in my instructions from theWar Cabinet. Much of the credit for this is due to the careful work of theMinister of State during his visit to Washington in October when he discussed the work of UNRRA at length with Mr. Acheson and Governor Lehman. Thememorandum which he then wrote formed the basis of our own instructions andalso of the instructions given to the United States Delegation. The fact thatthe United States Delegation and we ourselves went into the Council Meeting atAtlantic City with similar instructions had a most happy effect on our workingrelations with the United States Delegation. From the first we were on a footingof complete frankness, and Acheson and I consulted each other on every stepthroughout the three weeks of the session.2.   The existence of this common measure of agreement between the state department and ourselves enabled us to approach the opening of the council meeting with rather more certainty than that with which our Delegation at theHot Springs Conference on Food and Agriculture were able to approach their work.   Nevertheless, it was clear that there were many hazards before us and,while we could see our way forward, the consequences of straying from the waywere likely to be more serious than in the case of the Hot Springs Conference,which was necessarily dealing with a more remote stage in affairs.   The mainpitfalls were either that UNRRA would become, as many thought it should, theonly authority through which all occupied or conquered territories should conduct their future economic and supply affairs, or that, in preventing such a monstrousgrov/th, we should allow it to be thought that we were preventing the Administra-tion from carrying out efficiently its main task of bringing succour to the needy.It will be seen from resolution I that we Were able to secure a definition of thescope of UNRRA, which gives it full authority to conduct its great task of bringing relief to the victims of war and conducting such other emergencyoperations as the control of epidemics and the repatriation of Axis hostages andslaves, without being allowed to stray into the realm of reconstruction and theprovision of full employment.  We were able to do this without, I think, creatingany misunderstandings on the part of the representatives of occupied countries.By the end of the Session, it seemed to be fairly well understood that, by limiting the scope of UNRRA to the short-term emergency tasks, we were improving theprospect of the really essential work being properly performed.   As Masaryk put it, &quot; Where there&apos;s Life, there&apos;s Scope.&quot;3. The other main pitfall concerned the Combined Boards. The danger was always present that in advancing the thesis that UNRRA should put its requirements to the Combined Boards, who would allocate supplies betweenliberated countries and other claimants, we might precipitate a fresh demand onthe part of some of the stronger exiled Governments for direct representation onthe Boards. I have no doubt that such a demand would have been pressed had it not been for the fact that we were able to discuss informally with the French and belgian representatives a proposal for contact between themselves and the combined Boards which, though not giving them membership, would provide anopportunity for them to make sure that their interests were being looked after.I also let it be known that we were going to- dissent from any enlargement of the boards at this stage of the war and that the choice before the Council was that of using a machine that had played no small part in achieving our present high degree of production or of deciding not to use it. In the latter case I did Hot see how UNRRA would get any but the most meagre supplies. At one point in the session it looked as if we might have to give a series of detailed explanations of how the Combined Boards worked, before the principle of UNRRA dealing through them would be accepted. This threat, however, never materialised, &quot;and anyquestioning which there may have been in the minds of delegates about the useof the Combined Board machinery was overlaid by an argument between theDirector-General and those Governments which expected to be able to pay fortheir supplies as to the manner in which their requirements should be submittedto the Combined Boards. This conflict took place in the Sub-Committee of whichI was Chairman and when its smoke had cleared away, all were committed to theuse of the Combined Board machinery, and this basic principle was never againdiscussed.[26575]
4. I have referred above to the close collaboration between the UnitedKingdom Delegation and the United States Delegations. The Americans were amuch more impressive team at this Conference than they were at Hot Springs.Aeheson took pains to give a clear lead, and on those occasions when one of histeam took an independent line, he did not hesitate to call him to order. his task was simplified by the existence of written instructions to his Delegation acircumstance which might well have been absent had the Minister of State not provided the basis for these instructions beforehand. When Acheson becameChairman of the Council, a position which he strove to avoid, some of us feared that he might not find time to continue to run his own Delegation. This fearproved to be unfounded. He was both an excellent Chairman and an effectiveleader. Whatever is written or said about the meeting there can be no disputethat Acheson&apos;s own performance was a tour cle force from which all benefited.5. With the other British Commonwealth Delegations we enjoyed the mosthappy and intimate relations. During the ten days before we went to AtlanticCity we held two meetings with them to discuss various matters on the Agenda,and during the three weeks at Atlantic City consultation between us on all matters as they arose was continuous. The attitude of the other British Delega-tions towards consultation with the United Kingdom and with one another wasin roailced contrast to the attitude some of them adopted at Hot Springs. Withmen like Mike Pearson and Brooke Claxton&apos; of Canada, Sir Owen Dixon ofAustralia, Sir Girja Bajpai of India, Cox of New Zealand and Close and Brennanof South Africa, there was never any doubt that close relations between BritishCommonwealth Delegations was thoroughly welcome to them., 8. The Soviet Delegation arrived when the Conference was half way through,sino3 they started late from Moscow and were held up by bad weather in Siberia.During the period before the Delegation arrived, their place on the Council wastaken by the Soviet Ambassador in Washington, Mr. Gromyko. Since he had nodetailed instructions and was fearful of doing anything to incur the displeasureof his Government, he was ultra-cautious and his unwillingness to take any decision did not help the progress of business. When the Delegation properarrived, however, the position changed.. Our relations with them were cordialfrom the first. The leader of the Delegation, Mr. SergeeV, one of the AssistantCommissars of Foreign Trade, spoke English, and was clearly on top of his job.Shortly after he arrived he lunched with me in my room. A few minutes beforethe time of the lunch I was summoned by Acheson to an emergency meeting andconsequently arrived late at the lunch, after the others had consumed a certainamount of vodka. When I explained, Sergeev said : &quot; I know that you could, not help being late, and quite understand what detained you. Nevertheless you arelate and for that you must pay a penalty. We have been drinking vodka, and you must be level with us therefore you shall drink this.&quot; He then handed mea large full glass and proposed the toast of our success together. I drankthis &quot; bottoms up,&quot; and from that time our relations never looked back. later the Russians gave us a dinner which was certainly the gayest and the mostunrestrained of the whole Session. For these happy relations with the soviet delegation, Mr. John Russell of the Embassy in Washington, who talks Russianfluently and spent the whole time in Atlantic City with us, was largely respon-sible. His performance throughout was admirable and his crowning achievement of a Cossack dance on the table at the end of dinner completely won the hearts ofour Russian friends.7. Of the other Delegations, the Dutch were outstanding for their goodsense and quiet efficiency. The French Delegation was by no means as effective.Monnet spent a large amount of the time when he should, have been at AtlanticCity in Washington, and his relations with the rest of his Delegation were neverhappy. At this meeting, as at Hot Springs, the French irritated everyone bytrying to insist on small points designed to bolster their prestige. Consequentlythey achieved the exact opposite. As might be expected, relations between thePoles and the Russians were far from happy. The position of strain was con-siderably increased by the showing of a Russian film which mingled interminablehorror pictures with open anti-Polish propaganda. This was most unfortunate, asthe Polish Delegation was an able one and did its best to contribute to the work ofthe Council and to avoid provoking the Russians. Of the other European Delega-tions, the outstanding figures were Masaryk of Czechoslovakia, Varvaressqs of greece, and Spaak of Belgium.  M. Morgenstierne, of the Norwegian Delegation,
was also outstanding, but only for the number of times on which he found itnecessary to intervene in Committee, rather than for the aptness of what he thenhad to say.8. One of the more notable features of the Session was the small part played by the Chinese and also by the Latin Americans. The subdued attitude of thelatter was, of course, due to their anxiety lest, by assuming too much prominence,they might in some way increase the financial contribution they were expected tomake. The Chinese seemed to be playing a lone hand. What they are after seemsto be the thorough reconstruction and development of China at the expense of theforeigner. If UNRRA can be milked for part of the money, so much the better;there will.be less to find elsewhere. Their aims and their conception of relief aretherefore somewhat different from those of the occupied countries in Europe.9. There was, I think, no dispute that the team which I had working underme was the most able of those at Atlantic City. At almost every Committee and sub-Committee the United Kingdom representative was in a position- of knowingmore about the subject and what the Committee ought to do than anybody else.Sir Frederick Leith-Ross was recognised on all sides as the father of UNRRA.He was supported by three of his staff from the Relief Department, all of whom had worked closely with the European Allies on relief problems and were wellknown to them. I was fortunate to have, in addition, a strong team from theSupply Departments in London and from the Embassy and Missions in washington. We were a numerous team, but I am sure that this was right andthat our contribution to the work would have been less effective with a smaller one.10. The organisation of the Council meeting was always a little peculiar.Theoretically, there were three independent groups of Americans present theUnited States Delegation, the Secretariat of the Council and the Director-GeneraFs staff. In practice this meant only two groups, since the Secretariat werenearly all taken from OFRRO, Lehman&apos;s American organisation, and weremostly candidates for employment in UNRRA. There was a legacy of dispute between the State Department and OFRRO over the scope of UNRRA, and the secretariat usually felt it their duty to pull the whole field of economic relationsinto the scope of UNRRA and, if possible, to have it discussed at theirCommittees. Fortunately they were for the most part incompetent, and it wasnot difficult to circumvent their operations. One instance was over the Agenda ofthe various ad hoc Sub-Committees appointed for the Session. Although the listof Sub-Committees had been in existence for several weeks, no attempt had beenmade to work out their agenda and to fit them together. Each secretary made hisown list of topics, and, since they never consulted one another, the result was aconsiderable amount of overlap. When this became apparent, I arranged withAcheson that the United Kingdom delegation would produce a new and compre-hensive agenda for all the Sub-Committees. This revised agenda was presented by Acheson and approved without much alteration. Fortunately before leavingAtlantic City we had established such friendly relations with Lehman that wewere able, at his urgent invitation, to help him with suggestions on the organisa-tion of the executive machine that he must now build up, and to correct some ofthe more fantastic blue-prints produced beforehand by the rioting imaginationof his &quot; aides.&quot;11. Hot Springs was a horizontal conference. A monstrous hotel sprawledover a beautiful valley and the delegates hurrying from meeting to meeting-covered many miles of ground. Our conference was vertical, and our problem was getting up and down. Since in this hotel of twenty stories and with aconference of over 1,000 people there were only three &quot; elevators,&quot; the problem was a severe one. The fact that the elevators were &quot; operated &quot; by a species ofaged gremlin, whose particular delight it was to take their charges, tiredand angry after 15 minutes wait, to the one floor they had not asked for, made it more difficult.12. The elevators and the Secretariat were our chief worries. Of the minorworries I should perhaps mention the Press. The Americans were most anxious not to repeat on this occasion the squabbles with the Press which had taken placeover the Hot Springs Conference. Press representatives were accordingly givenvery full facilities and numerous Press Conferences were arranged to explainwhat was going on. Whether the resulting publicity was successful, I am not qualified to judge. Certainly nearly all the news stories I saw about theConference succeeded in getting quite the wrong, emphasis.   This was partly due
to the operations of Lehman&apos;s press relations officer, who either did not knowor did not care whether the material he gave out was correct or not. It was alsopartly due to the fact that press men could always obtain a garbled account ofany meeting from a Latin American delegate which was sufficient basis for a story. One press representative said it was all so simple you rang up for aLatin American and he came as quickly and easily as a meal from the room service(which was an extremely efficient one).13. I came away from Atlantic City with a number of souvenirs forinstance, a key of the City and a proclamation by the Mayor commemoratingthe Conference and dedicating the three weeks which we spent at Atlantic City&quot; to be named and observed for all time in the City of Atlantic City as united nations Relief and Rehabilitation Time.&quot; I came away also with some amusingmemories, such as the occasion on the first afternoon when it was discovered thatdifferent representatives of the State Department had arranged for two differentpeople to be elected chairman of the Conference, but neither had informed the mexican Chairman of the Selection Committee.14. I also returned with a fewr general conclusions which may be worthrecording :  (1) With great pains we have set up a United Nations Relief and rehabilitation-tion Administration, and we have laid down the way in which it isto operate. If Lehman fails, the blame will rest primarily upon the americans and ourselves. He may fail unless he has the right staff and is given constant assistance by those Governments like our ownwhich have the necessary experience. We cannot afford to sit back and rest upon contribution in finance and supplies. Leadership isours and, whether we like it or not, we shall have to continue toexercise it in giving guidance and counsel.(2) We have now had two full dress United Nations Conferences. I assume that we shall have many more. Our experience at Hot Springs andAtlantic City shows that we can do very well at these Conferencesif we take enough trouble and pick the right team. I think it alsoshows that there is a technique in these matters the possession ofwhich gives great advantages, and which is developed by practice.We should, I believe, do well to select our Delegations for any futureConferences with this in mind.(3) I have referred above to the close collaboration between ourselves andthe American Delegation at Atlantic City. This collaboration would no doubt have been close in any event. It was as satisfactory as itwas, however, largely because of the great pains taken to iron out any differences there might have been between us before the Conferencebegan and to agree on principles I very much hope that we shall beable to enter future conferences with the same kind of preparationbehind us.
