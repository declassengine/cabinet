(THE DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNJvIENT)S, EGRETW.P.(45)  5616th   December, 1945WAR CABINETDEMOBILISATIONMemorandum by the Secretary pf. State for&quot; the Colonies1. The report of the Demobilisation Committee (V/.P. (43)494)does not apply to Colonial Forces but I have a special interest in the demobilisation not only of men of Colonialorigin but also of others serving with the Imperial Forces whowill be required on demobilisation for reconstruction anddevelopment of the Colonies, both in Government and commerciallife.      The report of the Committee recognised that arrange-ments will have to be made for the early demobilisation ofpivotal men and special occupational groups, and in thisconnection I wish to draw my colleagues&apos;  attention to thespecial requirements of the Colonial Empire.COPY NO.2.          Conditions in the Colonial Empire are essentiallydifferent from those of the United Kingdom or the Dominions.Generally speaking throughout the Colonial Empire allEuropeans can be said to be Ice;/ men:    they are not    employedin subordinate    capacities,.      The early release of -Europeanswill have an immediate effect upon the production anddevelopmental activities of the Colonies,,    ........3, To a certain extent this feature of Colonial organ-isation has been recognised in withholding   permission fromthose in Colonial employment who wished to  enter the fightingservicesj and in permitting the return of numbers of men,both officials and unofficials, who were accepted for combatantservice during the early stage of the war.      But at theconclusion of European hostilities there will still be.anumber of Colonials in the Imperial Forces eligible for demobilisation; very few in relation to the size of the Army,but of particular importance&apos;&quot;because of their influence onthe administrations  development and productive output of theColonies.4, In addition there.has been a large loss of trained personnel, both through ordinary wastage,   and through wartime casualties.      Between 1,500 and 2^000 new entrantswill be required to make good the deficiencies in thetechnical branches of the Colonial Service.      Since thenormal retiring age for Colonial Service is 50 to 55 it isessential that men of under 30 should be selected for appointment, and these.will not be in the early demobilisationgrades under the present scheme.      It is, therefore, suggestedthat selection of candidates for appointment to the colonial service should be made in co-operation with the service departments and that special arrangements should be made forthe release of those so selected for overseas service,  eitherwithin the limit of 10,000 men who are to receive priorityas key men or as an addition to that figure.      Men soreleased will not prejudice the chances of other men whowill be looking for jobs at home.-1-

5. The same argument applies also to the earlydemobilisation of men required for commercial postsabroad, who may number several hundred.      Indeed,in so far as their activities affect colonial development they will stimulate the home market and thereby create employment in the United Kingdom.The    Colonial Office would undertake to certifywhether any particular applicant was required for essential work in a Polony.6. I therefore ask that in view of the special needs of the Colonies special directions should begiven to facilitate the demobilisation of:-(a) Colonial Service officials serving withthe Forces.(b) Candidates selected for new appointment to the Colonial Service.(c) Persons certified by the Colonial Officeto be required for production,reconstruction and development workin the Colonies.0.
