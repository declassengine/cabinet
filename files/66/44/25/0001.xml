Reportsstate that all the Embassies and Legations, except the Spanish Embassy, were damaged or completely destroyed; the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the HomeOffice, the Propaganda Ministry and several other Government departments were damaged or gutted; damage which is believed to have been severe was caused,in the Alexanderplatz area. The Potsdarner Station was wholly burnt out or destroyed; the Anhalter Station was very severely damaged; the StettinerStation was seriously damaged; the Schlesischer, Friedrichstrasse and ZooStations were hit; the result of these and other incidents was that public transport and main-line railway traffic in and from the centre of the city were wholly suspended for a time. Electricity, gas and water were cut off in parts ofthe city.A good concentration of bombing was claimed in the second attack, on the23rd/24th November. This is reported to have caused nearly as much damageas the previous attack, the weight of it falling mainly in the same areas.The attack on the 26th/27th November, which was made in conjunction withan attack by Halifaxes on Stuttgart, took place in conditions of ho cloud but some haze. The enemy was uncertain where the main attack was going to develop and few fighters were encountered until near the end of the raid. Fires fromthe two previous attacks were seen to be still burning. More damage was causedbut no extensive new fires were seen.The last attack on the 2nd/3rd December achieved a fair. concentration inthe south and south-east parts of the city. Towards the end of the attack, fires were reported as spread over an area of about 10 square miles and there wras apall of smoke hanging over the city.It is impossible at present to make a full assessment of the material resultsof these attacks, but from the reports so far received there can be no doubt that part of the western end of the Unter den Linden, the Wilhelmstrasse and muchproperty lying to the south of the Tiergarten have been severely damaged.

the Potsdamer Platz (the main west-end traffic centre), Columbus House, Berlin&apos;stallest building, has been gutted. Severe damage in the Alexanderplatz area,from which virtually the whole of Berlin&apos;s food supplies are distributed, maywell account for the Press reports of severe food distribution difficulties. no confirmation from Intelligence sources is jet available of Press reports of damage in the important industrial districts of Siemensstadt and Spandau. Evidenceof the closing down and. evacuation of business firms is, however, beginning tocome in, and from this it appears that there is hardly any quarter in the city thathas not been affected. A minimum figure of those rendered homeless by the fourattacks is 800,000.Frankfurt (25th/26th November).This attack was carried out in cloudy conditions by a force of 262 aircraft,made up principally of Halif axes.  No daylight photographs are yet available.Stuttgart (26th/27th November).There is as yet no information on the results achieved in this attack.Leipzig (3rd/4th December).The routing of the aircraft during this attack succeeded in leading theenemy to think that Berlin was to be the objective and aircraft losses werecomparatively light. Daylight photographs of Leipzig taken immediatelyafterwards show a vast conflagration round the main railway station, but cloudsof smoke make detailed interpretation impossible. The Germans stated at thetime that great destruction was caused in several districts of the city and thata number of public buildings were destroyed.Results of Previous Raids.Mannheim-./ Ludwigshajen.Photographs taken on the 29 th November after the attack on the17th/18th November show that about 20 buildings were destroyed or damaged in the I.G. Farben Works. It is reliably reported that production in these workshad not recommenced by the 23rd November. Owing to the heavy devastationcaused in previous raids on Mannheim, it is not easy to identify fresh damage,but it is clear that the factory of Daimler Benz A.G., a glass works and a boat-building yard were hit.In the attack on the 11th/ 12th November, the Acieries du Nord locomotiverepair works at La Bocca were so badly damaged that it is possible that repair work on them may not be undertaken. On the same night, the W/T submarinecontrol station at Agay was destroyed.The following quotation in the Gazette de Lausanne of the 27th October,1943, from a report from a correspondent who recently had occasion to make ajourney through Germany, is of interest: :&quot;If we are to be objective, we must recognise that the military events which we have just mentioned were only a secondary reason for thispsychological depression. The main reason was the continued offensive ofthe Allied air forces. One can never lay too much emphasis on the disastrouseffects on German morale produced by the night raids of the R.A.F. andU.S.A.A.F. It is not only a question of Hamburg annihilated, : Essenreduced to a heap of smoking ruins, of Cologne, Dtisseldorf and Rostockdevastated, but of every town and village, even those situated in distantdistricts where the danger from the air is feared because of what has been experienced at night for the past year. There are very few Germans who can go to sleep unafraid, and who do not have their suitcases containingtheir most necessary belongings beside their beds.h Enough has been said about the disastrous effects of the great raids;&apos;    they were at the bottom of the Italian capitulation.   In Germany they arefeared even more because, in the event of destruction, or even mere damage,it is impossible to replace the smallest articles of clothing, furniture, utensils/    or food.  And it is impossible to find lodgings.&quot;Cannes.General.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, 16th December, 1943.
