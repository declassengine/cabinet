(43) 585.28*A December, 1943.Copy No.     ti 4WAR CABINET.COAL SITUATION IN INDIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.A difficult situation has developed in regard to the production and distribu^tion of eoal in India and I think that my colleagues may like to have for their information the attached note of the facts. I do not suggest that discussioriin the Cabinet is required at present. In so far as action here seems possibleto help the Government of India in their difficulties it has either already beentaken or is under discussion between the Departments concerned.L. S. A.India Office, 28th December, 1943.Note on the Coal Situation in India.The great bulk of India&apos;s coal production is in Bihar and Bengal, and supplies to consumers in other parts of India have to be carried by rail mostlyover very great distances.   The principal requirements are for : Tons per month.1,025,000(this is a severelyrationed figure)836,000 -110,00064,00030,00078,0002,143,0002.   There are two serious difficulties.   They are (a) Transportation. The supply of wagons to the pits (which is, of course,dependent upon the locomotive position as well as on the wagonposition itself) has always been a limiting factor on the availability ofcoal to consumers. As is well known, the Indian Railways, which werebadly equipped when the war began, have received no fresh equipment for four years and are now incapable of carrying the traffic essentialto the conduct of the war and the maintenance of India&apos;s economyabove a dangerously low level. Indeed, transportation is a bottleneckwhich is to a considerable degree responsible for India&apos;s present economic troubles. About 50 per cent, of the load on the railways con-desists of coal and the inadequacy of transport facilities is a constantand great difficulty in moving enough coal to meet minimum needs.Special difficulty arose during the period July-October 1943, when themain lines into Calcutta were breached by floods and no coal couldbe made available for shipment.(b) Labotir-The   mine-workers   are   semi-aboriginals   who   are    alsoagriculturists. They normally attend at the mines irregularly duringthe second half of the year, in order that they may deal with their[26629] &quot;Industry and public utilitiesRailways  ...BunkersSteamer CompaniesCeylonMiddle East
crops. During this period reliance is made for steady railings uponthe stocks built up in the coal-fields during the first half of the year.This year, however, stocks in the coal-fields on the 1st July stood atthe comparatively low level of 2 million tons and since then the minershave drifted away from the pits to a much greater extent than usual.This is caused by :  i) The rival attractions of more remunerative employment on military works, open to husbands and wives together, which hasnot been the case in the mines.Cii) The scarcity of food in the coal-fields has kept labour away andthe effects of a heavy incidence this year of malaria have been aggravated by under-nourishment.(iii) The mine-workers have been getting such good prices for theircrops.that they have less incentive to work in the mines.3. The Government of India have set themselves a target figure of 2,137,000tons to be moved each month from the coal-fields. This would just about meet therequirements set out in the first paragraph of this note, but, although it would be almost a record figure, requirements have so risen that even its achievement wouldhave involved rationing essential industries below the bone and allowing coalstocks to fall to twenty days&apos; consumption on the 1st December. It has, however,not been achieved, as production has been only Tons.July 1943 ...August 1943September 1943October 1943November 1943December 19431,921,0001,896,0002,138,0001,850,0001.600.0001,900,000(estimated)(forecast)The low level of stocks on the 1st July (less than a month&apos;s supply) made itevidently impracticable to make good this shortfall by drawing on stocks. It ishoped to get just above the target by about the middle of January. Meanwhileindustries (which have periodically had to stop for short periods) are beingseriously affected and railway stocks are becoming precarious. The danger to military operations of railway stocks falling too low requires no emphasis.4. It is, of course, desirable that India, besides supplying her own require-ments, should assist the solution of the world coal shortage by finding the30,000 tons per month needed by Ceylon and by making a maximum contributionto the requirements of the Middle East.   But while lines intoCalcutta were breached between July and October, no shipments of coal were possible. Since then, Ceylon&apos;s needs have been almost met, but exports to theMiddle East have been negligible owing to the drop in production. It is hoped to resume them in January.5.   The following remedial action has been or is being taken (a) Mr. P. C. Young, C.B.E., until recently Coal Supplies Officer, Scotland,&apos; has been appointed Coal Commissioner under the Government ofIndia, in order to co-ordinate the activities of the various departments of the Government of India in regard to production, distribution,transportation, procurement on Government account, labour manage-ment, the supply of food for labour and the supply of miningequipment. He is expected to leave the United Kingdom to take up his post in a few days.(b) Locomotives are now coming forward from North America. Metre-gaugewagons and wagon components to help India to carry out her broad-gauge wagon construction programme, are also being supplied from north America in addition to smaller quantities of wagon componentsfrom the United Kingdom. Procurement has been through militarychannels, but constant pressure to maintain and increase supplies isnecessary on the United States authorities, who are hesitant aboutIndia&apos;s needs, and have shown signs of trying to draw an unrealisticdistinction between railway equipment needed for military and thatneeded for civil purposes.
9 -l r:3 ht v,: *J(c) In so far as coal can be brought to Calcutta for shipment coastwise toMadras, Cochin, Bombay and Karachi to meet requirements there theMinistry of War Transport have agreed to arrange its carriage by sea and thus reduce the quantities of coal which have to be railed on long hauls.(d) The United States Government have agreed to reduce greatly thequantity of manganese to be railed to seaboard for export to theUnited States, which competes for wagon capacity with coal.(e) The Government of India have improved their administrative machineryfor dealing with colliery stores requirements and have asked for asubstantial quantity of excavators and other coal-mining equipment.This is under consideration with the other Departments in Londonconcerned.(/) In Bengal and Bihar minimum basic food rations for miners and their families at concessional prices have been fixed and the provincial governments have been asked to make the necessary quantitiesavailable. Increased supplies of consumer goods are also being sentto the coalfields.(g) The Government of India appointed in September a Chief WelfareOfficer of Mines with two assistants in order to improve welfarearrangements in the coal-fields. At the same time an enquiry was instituted into the supply to the miners of food, educational and medical facilities, and housing.(h)&apos; Efforts are being made by the Government of India to stop recruitmentin the coal-fields for military works or by military contractors, and theimportation of labour from other parts of India for defence works is under consideration.(*) The Government of India have decided to permit the temporaryreintroduction of woman labour underground in the mines in Biharand Bengal.(j) The effect of the Indian excess profits tax on coal production is being examined.(
