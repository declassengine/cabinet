These arguments were finally accepted by the President, to whom I submitted them.w. s. c.10, Downing Street, S.W.1,28th December, 1943.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSUPREME COMMAND ER OF ALL OPERATIONS AGAINSTGERMANY.THE difficulties and short-comings in our conduct of the war since, the battle of Salerno have arisen from divergences of view between our two Staffs and governments. It is not seen how these divergences would be removed by theappointment of a Supreme Commander working under the Combined Chiefs.ofthe Staff and liable to have his decisions reversed by them. The divergences,which are political as much as military, would still have to be adjusted by thepresent methods of consultation between the Combined Staffs and the Heads o*&quot;the two Governments. Thus the Supreme Commander, after being acclaimed asthe world war-winner, would in practice find his functions restricted to the narrow ground between the main decisions of policy and strategy which can onlybe dealt with by the present methods, and the spheres of the two chief regionalCommanders.2. This would certainly not be sufficient to justify arousing all the expecta-tions and setting up all the apparatus inseparable from the announcement of a&quot; Supreme Commander for the defeat of Germany.&quot;3. On the other hand, if the power of decision is in fact accorded to theSupreme Commander, the work of the Combined Chiefs of the Staff would be virtually superseded and very great stresses would immediately arise between theGovernments and the Supreme Commander. Without going into personalities^it is greatly to be doubted whether any single officer exists who would be capableof giving decisions over the vast range of problems now dealt with by the Headsof Governments assisted by the Combined Chiefs of the Staff.4. The principle which should be followed as far as possible between allies of equal status is that the Command in any theatre should go to the Ally whohas the largest forces deployed or about to be deployed there. On this it wouldbe natural that the Command in the Mediterranean should be British and thatthe Command of &apos;&apos; Overlord &apos;&apos; should be American. Such Commands would alsocorrespond with the outlook of the two Governments, the Americans regarding&quot;Overlord&quot; of overwhelming importance, while the British believe that thegreatest and most immediate results can be obtained in the Mediterranean andthat &apos;&apos; Overlord &quot; is a knock-out blow, the timing of which must be settled inrelation to the condition and dispositions of the enemy.5. If the two Commands are merged under a Supreme Commander, theBritish would have available against Germany in May decidedly larger forcesthan the United States. It would therefore appear that the Supreme Commandshould go to a British officer. I should be very reluctant, as Flead of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, to place such an invidious responsibility upon a British officer. Ihave very little doubt that he would concentrate his main effort on the Mediter-ranean and treat the &apos;&apos; Overlord &apos;&apos; sphere as a highly important but none the lessresiduary legatee. This point of view would certainly not be accepted by theGovernment or Staff of the United States. If, on the other hand, disregardingthe preponderance of forces involved, the Supreme Command was given to a united States officer and he pronounced in favour of concentrating on &quot; Over-lord &apos;&apos; irrespective of the injury done to our affairs in the Mediterranean, HisMajesty&apos;s Government could not possibly agree. The Supreme Commander,British or American, would therefore be placed in an impossible position. Havingassumed before the whole world the responsibility of pronouncing and beingoverruled by one Government or the other, he would have little choice but to resign.This might bring about a most serious crisis in the harmonious and happyrelations hitherto maintained between our two Governments.6. It is not seen why the present arrangement should not continue, subjectto any minor improvements that can be suggested. Under this arrangement, an american Commander would conduct the immense Operation &apos;&apos; Overlord&apos;&apos; anda British Commander would conduct the war in the Mediterranean, their action being concerted and forces assigned by the Combined Chiefs of, the Staff working under the Heads of the two Governments. Regular periodic conferences shouldbe held at Gibraltar between the two Commanders, at which they could adjust[26630]

More frequent meetings of the Com-bined Chiefs of Staff should also be arranged, and possibly monthly visits of one week&apos;s duration by the Chairman of each Chiefs of Staff Committee alternately toLondon and Washington.&quot;&apos; - w. s. c. .
