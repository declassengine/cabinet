this document IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)V8IE C R E TV/.P.(43)  57217TH DECEMBER,  19451.47IS copy NO..WAR CABINETMIDDLE EAST CEREAL prices memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. In common with other Middle East prices, those ofcereals are now many times above pre-war levels.     They arealso,  in spite of increased freights and higher prices inAustralia or Canada, much above the prices of importedcereals.     Typical wheat prices are:-Imported CLP. EgyptCanadian^o2SAustralian(Flour) 19 -  20Local F.Q.R.Egyptian     Syrian     Turkish 53  56(Again, Iraq barley,  the largest surplus, has risen from about  4 per ton f.o.b. at the beginning of the war to 30 f.o.b. now,2. Whilst the Middle East is normally a net exporter of grain, during 1941 and 1942 a number of factors caused a drop in production which left a deficit to be covered by imports.      In these years the problem was further aggravated by hoarding which was partly speculative in anticipation of higher prices,  and partly due to the fear of starvationowing    to the nearness of the battle-front.      It was thenfound that unless steps were taken to collect grain from the farmers by some official organisation,  it tended to vanishinto hoards and be lost for distribution to the urbanpopulations.      This year the situation is different in    so faras there is a surplus in the area of around 500,000 tons ofvarious cereals and the war is now further removed.      It is nevertheless still felt strongly in Cairo that we must paythe prices asked in order to ensure that grain is centrallycollected without delay after the harvest.      Unless we do this, Cairo asserts that we risk- losing some of it altogether,and that this would prejudice the whole Middle East grain plan.3o On the other hand purchase - at current prices is adirect burden on us,  since the consumers are the Army or british Territories whilst the producing countries all holdsurplus sterling.     But the direct cost is by no means the.end of the effect of purchasing at high price.     Some of thesecereals, particularly barley in Iraq, and wheat in Syria, havea   taw .   more than proportionate effect on the general levelof prices in those countries.     In consequence, any increasein the prices of these cereals reacts, in a greater or lesser degree, on the prices which we pay in those countries for all goods and services which wo buy there, and increases the cumulative burden on us by many times the amount of the direct cost.4. Unless we can break the spiral of rising prices, there seems no limit to the demands which can be put upon us.Certainly if we pay what we are asked.now we shall be facedwith higher prices next year.     No Middle Easterner expects to receive the first price he asks.     Furthermore, payment ofunduly high prices has not been found to be a good incentive

to high production in backward countries; particularly wherefarmers cannot buy what they want with the resultant cash,,5. The problem is further complicated by differentialprices in various areas.      Thus,  the Syrian   farmer gets  40per ton for wheat,  the Egyptian farmer  21 (to be raised&apos; to 28 next year)  and. the Oypriot  30,-,      To these prices have tobe added substantial handling eosts0      Certain territories areunable to   pay the excessive pricesP and have to meet thedifference by subsidy which may ultimately have to be found from the Imperial Exchequer,.-,6. Thsr - is full agreement  what in the light cf the deterioration in the world cereals situation we should collectas much of the local grain as possible and with this end inmind   -(a) The collection schemes should be kept going wherever they existc,(b) We should not discourage the peasants from sowingthe maximum area by lowering prices too much,(g) We should as far as possible  resist any attempts to impose export or other taxes on what we buy0V8 This year there is an appreciable o\irplus0     Moreover,the general position of the war,, which has a powerfulinfluence upon the small producer, would not encourage him tohoard for a rise of priceSo      Whenever the war news takes aturn for the better in oho Middle East prices tend to falloIn some of the prices we are asked to pay in the Middle Eastthere is an element of plain blackmails      I feel convinced.that now is the time to take a definite line that we expect areduction of the prices of cereals-,.      I believe that theMinister of State Resident in the Middle East would be assisted by a clear expression- of our view and that his telegram283 REMAC is probably written reader a fear about the need forcereal supplies next year0      Accordingly I ask that mycolleagues should agree that a telegram in this sense shouldbe sent to the Minister^      The terms of such a telegram wouldbe agreed with the Departments concerned,.8, In the ease of Iraq, a line of policy has been agreed,which it is believed will satisfy the Minister of StateResident in the Middle East and yet produce some reduction,in price0      The relevant telegram is attached (Annex A) fori nformat ion09* An alternative policy is., however, possible in Syriawhich would avoid the complications of paying prices evenabove other Middle&apos; Eastern priceso      It is suggested that theFrench would be willing to let us have the surplus Syriancereals now, provided, we undertook to replace an equal tonnage to Metropolitan France without charge in the Relief periodsThe Minister of State Resident in the Middle East feels thatthis proposal..: if put to the French, would give them theopportunity to ess tract and delay the acquisition of the syrian surpluses for united Nations ussso      On the other hand the French have already been pressed to grow as much grainas possible for the Relief period,-      We might well indicate to them the if they failed to collect what has been grownthis might influence allocations by the Combined Boards toMetropolitan France at a subsequent date *10*       In the circumstances it is recommended that we approach,the French to see whether they will exchange the Syrian sur-pluses for part of any Relief to Metropolitan Prance0     If they

delay or refuse we would revert to the policy of purchase.      Inthe meantime a . telegram has been sent to the Minister of StateResident in the Middle East (Annex B)  instructing him to startconversations with the G-rain Collection Office in order tokeep the position open0JoAeTreasury Chambers,  S&apos;BW* 1*17th December,ANNEX ATelegram despatched to Minister of    State, Cairo.Repeated to Baghdad.Present position in Iraq is that with recentpurchases the 3 Barley firms have enough dirty barley contractedfor or bought to keep cleaning facilities and transport fully employed for 8 weeks.,      Offers are now coming in at lower prices and,  as a result of meetings with the 3 firms in London,the UyK.C.C.v  are completely confident that they will be able topurchase at prices lower than those now ruling,  all the barley  .which can be transported out of Iraq, together with a substant-ial carry forward into next season.      Their plans, which havebeen agreed with the 3 firms, allow for the utilisation and services of the other two   firms whilst one single firm is acting in the market as principal buyer,,2. In the light of the foregoing we have instructed U.K.C.O.(a) To go ahead and make contracts with the firms for thepurchase of Barley additional to 200,000 tons (which isnow virtually all bought).(b) Not to cause any substantial reduction in price, part-particularly to the growers,(c) To ensure that there is always a reserve stock of barleyof at least (repeat at least) 3 weeks ahead of cleaningand transport facilities to Basra,3* The arguments in your telegram under reference have  ..been fully considered but we do not feel that conditions this,year are parallel with lasto     Although we agree that the 1944crop can hardly be as large as this.year1s record there will still be a substantial carry forward into next season, v/hich withthe new crop should mean a continuation of adequate supplies forsome time ahead.      Last year when the Middle East was deficientin grain and the Germans still in North Africa the tendency forbarley to go to ground was naturally more marked.      The Indiandemand and the prospective world shortage of cereals may&quot;operate in the opposite direction, but largely only if we showundue anxiety to buy which the Middle Easterner will not be slow to exploit by withholding his grain for an anticipated rise04. The plan outlined in paragraph 1... brings in sight afurther 150,000 tons this season with another 200,000 tons next,but it is essential for the successful completion of this pro-gramme that the operations of the buying firms should remainundisturbed,  in order to permit them to implement their offers.I feel sure you will appreciate that there are reasons why theless we say to the Iraqi authorities the better.     We realisehowever, that you are vitally interested in any progress beingmade, and we shall therefore keep you in the closest possibletouch with developments and we have..arranged for, U.K.C.C. toprovide regular reports,,

ANNEX   B.Telegram despatched to Minister of State.Repeated to Beirut Algiers.Your telegram   No. 2732*Pending a decision on the general price -questionwe quite agree that we should indicate to the O.C.P.that their collection operations must continue.   . v;esuggest that the best way to hold the position and keep collections going pending final decision on thepolicy to be followed is to open tentative negotiationswith O.C.P. forthwith,2,     We still feel that the 11 per cent charge for adminsitrative expenses is high whilst we should not pay15 per cent to the Syrian Government.      To do so wouldcomplicate our position in Egypt where we have alwaysresisted the imposition of export taxes on rice andother cereals.      Time can be saved discussing these points now, since they would,  in any case require tobe got out of the way.     We feel that unless we raisethese financial adjustments now we shall be unable toget them considered at a later stage.3,     Black barley. &apos;    Is this only fit for fodder?      if so do the Army require it or have we any other use for it?      If we have no use for black barley we cannot accept the proposition that we buy all lots offered or nothing,4e     Which department do you consider should make anypurchase contract with O.C.P?     You will no doubtcomment urgently on the above questions *
