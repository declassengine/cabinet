Po&apos;cuLs  this   DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 8 GOVERNMENTSECRET Copy No.y.p. (45)555, 193rd December. .1945WAR   CABINET&apos;  / DEMOBILISATION   AND   RESETTLEMENTMemorandum by Minister of Labour and National service.     The Report of the Demobilisation Committee (Y/.P. (45)494)raises certain major questions to which I wish to direct special attention.     These are dealt with in paragraphs 2-6 &quot;below.     Theremainder of this memorandum outlines the functions, &quot;bearing on demobilisation, already entrusted to the Ministry of Labour andraises certain questions on which I require Cabinet authority forfurther action.Major Questions arising on the Report ofDemobilisation Committeo2*     Age and length of Service as basic principle of the demobilisation PlanI remain strongly of the opinion that we should adhere tothis basic principle, governing the order of release from theForces, and that we should not modify the plan to permit of thespecial release of large numbers of men out of their turn.     It isan overriding consideration that the scheme must be accepted asfair by the men and women in the Forces, and I cannot believethat it would be so accepted if age and length of service were largely disregarded on industrial grounds.It is not difficult to make out a case for priority for manyoccupations, only a few of which are mentioned in the Report.But if the principle of Block release is once incorporated inthe plan it would be impossible to confine it to one or twooccupations, and block releases would absorb the bulk of the mento be demobilised in the early stages.     I share the view of theSecretary of State for War that this would cause serious troubleamongst the men in the Forces and their dependants at home.
I agree that there should he individual releases in exceptional cases, hut the numbers must he strictly controlled through theCo-ordinating Committee proposed in the Report and the merits ofeach case on industrial grounds must he subjected to the closestscrutiny.3.     Weight for Overseas service this is the most difficult of the questions raised &quot;by a two-stage ending of the war, hut I have the gravest doubt about the compromise solution proposed in the Report.     To limit thepreference to the current tour of service of men who are overseasat the Armistice would, I fear, he likely to.give rise to glaringanomalies which could not be defended.     If it is impossible to giveweight for overseas service generally, then compensations must&quot;he sought in other directions than preference in demobilisation, e.g.i&amp;i   improvements in Service pay and in a really substantial periodof leave with pay on eventual demobilisation for those who haveto be retained overseas for the Japanese war.4.     Preference for Married MenWhile I have no strong feeling in favour of granting a preference for marriage in the case of men, I recognise that thereIS   likely to he powerful support for it in the House and else-where.     I am accordingly prepared to agree that the Committee^proposal should be included in the plan and thereby subjected to the test of public opinion.5.     Rate of Demobilisation . \ .I recognise that the extent of demobilisation at any given time must be decided on strategic and operational grounds, but Iwould urge that, as soon as the numbers to be released have been settled, they should he demobilised as quickly as transport facilities will permit.     Similarly I would ask that the standsstill period &quot;between the armistice and the beginning of
demobilisation, for which three months is suggested, should bekept as short as possible.While appreciating the difficulties of the service departments in formulating firm estimates, at this stage,of the numbers likely to be demobilised after the end ofthe war in Europe, it will clearly be vital to have this information as soon as the situation can be clearlyforeseen.      In this connection I gather that it is thepresent view of the Air Council that there will be no-   substantial release from the R.A.F. until&apos; the end of theJapanese war, and I would be glad to know if further examination confirms or modifies this view,6.     Period of Paid Furlough on DemobilisationThe Committee refer to my proposal for granting three monthspaid furlough on demobilisation.&apos;     Since this is at present underconsideration by the Lord Presidents Committee I wish now onlyto say that I regard it as a fundamental part of- the demobilisationplan, calculated to emphasize the determination of the Governmentto deal fairly and generously with members of the Forces in the demobilisation period.Functions of the Ministry of Labour and National Service -..in &quot;relation to&quot;demobillsation and resettlement7.      I think it may be helpful to my colleagues if I set out verybriefly the action being taken by my Department to prepare for itstask of resettling men and women released from the Forces and from war work.     The main items are as follows;-(i)    Machinery of Military Demobilisation?    the necessary machinery to link up.with military demobilisation isbeing established and I have set up a MilitaryDemobilisation Department for this purpose,- within thegeneral Man Power Department.
(ii)    Rjpinjstajbqment in civilian employment.;    a ReinstatementBill, designed to improve and extend the reinstatementprovisions of the National Service Acts, will shortly beintroduced in Parliament,(iii)    Training;  the preparatory work for the large-scale schemeof special training for the building industry is well underway, though the industry will not commit itself toco-operation in its application until they receive more information on post-war building programmes.     Similarplans for other industries are being considered and I amabout to make proposals for establishing the inter-departmental machinery necessary to work &quot;out schemes in ^detail and secure co-ordination with the training schemeswithin the Forces.(iv)    Further Education and Training for Higher Posts;      thescheme announced last March is in partial operation,  andwill be extended as &quot;soon as demobilisation begins,(v)    Rehabilitation, Training and Resettlement of the Disabled;the Bill to give effect to the recommendations of theTomlinson Committee has just been introduced in Parliament.(vi)    Advisory Service on Resettlements    it has already beendecided that my Department should set up Resettlement and welfare Bureaux to give advice and assistance on individualproblems of resettlement and the preparatory work on thishas begun.     The question of resettlement grants is underinterdepartmental consideration.There are certain matters, arising- from the foregoing, on which need further authority to proceed.-     They are as follows;-
El(i) Consultation with industry on the demobilisationplan:While I have had consultations with the T.U. C and B.E.C.  on several of the matters listed above and on other questions, whichwill arise after the armistice (e.g. the continuance of labour controls), I have not so far been in a position to put before them the general scheme of demobilisation from the Forces.     I am being pressed to do so and would be glad to have authority for it, assoon as the outstanding issues on the Report of the DemobilisationCommittee are settled.(ii) Co-ordinating Committee on DemobilisationI endorse the recommendation made in paragraph 5 of theReport for the establishment of a Co-ordinating Committee under aJoint Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Labour and national Service, and I ask that authority he given for it tobe set up without delay.(iii) Continued Call-up for the ForcesI agree with the view expressed in paragraphs 56 and 57 ofthe Report and would be glad to have authority now to work.outplans for the continued call up to the Forces, in the post-armisticeperiod, of young men reaching the age of 18 and young men above thatage whose call-up has&apos; hitherto been deferred.(iv) Release of war workers for civilian productionIn my view the most pressing need here is to settle the interdepartmental machinery for controlling the change-over from war production, establishing priorities for civilian productionand ensuring that materials, equipment, premises and labour become available as required.     I suggest that my^De^partment, in collaboration with the Ministry of Production, the Supply Depart-ments and the Board of Trade, should work out the necessary adjustments in the methods and technique successfully evolvedduring the war to deal with the transfer of lahour arising fromrevisions of the war production programmes.summary.     The decisions recommended in this memorandum are:-
(i) that the order of demobilisation should be governed by age and length of service, and that priorityreleases of individuals on industrial grounds shouldbe strictly limited and controlled;(ii) that it would be undesirable to give a preference for overseas service limited to certain categories andperiods of service;(iii) that the proposed preference for married men should beincluded in the plan;(iv) that,  as soon as the extent of demobilisation has been determined on operational grounds,.the personnel shouldbe returned to civilian life as quickly as possible;(v) that I should be authorised to put the demobilisationplan before the Joint Consultative Committee, as soonas the outstanding issues are settled;(vi) that the Co-ordinating Committee suggested in paragraph3 of the Report should be set up at once;(vii) that .plans should now be worked out for the continuedcall-up of young men after the armistice;(viii) that interdepartmental machinery be developed for controlling and expediting the change-over to civilianproduction on the basis of existing arrangements fordealing with revisions of war production programmes.E.B.-3rd December, 1943
