THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF 11  HIS &apos;BRITANN10 MAJgSTY&apos;S GOVERNICEITT .   7/.,,SECRET COPY NO-Sl&quot;ff. P. (43) 56414th. December, 1943 WAR CABINETDEMOBILISATIONMemorandum &quot;by the Minister of Labour and. National service have been giving further consideration to the question of demobilisationsince the War Cabinet&apos;s decision on 9th December (W.M. (43)168th Conclusions)and wish to put forward for the consideration of my colleagues the following proposals.1, Demobilisation of our Armed Forces should not take plaoe before theend of the Japanese war. This will emphasise that the japanese and the European war is one and the same war. The Armed forces should release men no longer needed on military grounds, but all such men should be placed on the Reserve and be deemed liable to recall.2. During the transition period between the end of the Suropean war andthe end of the Japanese war the man-power machine should bere-adapted and man-power re-allocated to meet the requirements of civilian industries to the extent that men and women can be released from the Services and from war production.3. For the purpose of this re-allocation during the transition periodyoung men at present deferred and those reaching the age of 18should continue to be called up and the present system of allocatingman-power between Departments should be continued.4* The basis of the release of men from the Forces should bo age and length of service.     I should not regard it as necessary formarriage or overseas service to carry any advantage for releaseunder these transitional arrangements.     It may be necessary totake account of them when we come to final demobilisation.5. Th^re   should also be a limited release of specialists irrespective of age and length of service.     The determination of whatspecialists should be released from time to time will depend on the allocations made and the availability of the men for release.
6. If the general approach to the position in the transition period is asindicated in precediiig paragraphs, it will be necessary to examine in closer detail than- \sa&amp; yet been possible the issues whioh will arise in connection with reinstatement rights and the period of paid furlough.7. Civilians at present engaged on war production, should during the/ transition period be transferred to civilian industries in accordancewith the allocations.     It will be necessary to release married womenwith household responsibilities from industry in order to let thosewho wish to do so return to their domestic duties.     Single and mobilewomen, however, will have to be held in their existing jobs ortransferred to other jobs in do far as this is necessary.     Men willhave to be transferred from war production to civilian industries asneoessary, special steps being taken to speed up such transfer inthe case of Civilian industries such as building and coal where thedemand is bound to be urgent,8,  he present inter-departmental machinery for arranging the transfers of capacity and labour should be developed in order to make the necessary adjustments in changing over from war production to civilianproduction.9. All controls should be maintained until the end of the Japanese war.Capacity will be released by the Supply Departments and man-power will be released by the Services and by war production.     Theretention of the necessary man-power on war production and there-direction by the Ministry of Labour to civilian industries, inaccordance with the allocations of man-power made available fromthe Services and war production, involves the use of all theexisting controls which must therefore be retained.14th December, 1943 5.B,
