(43) 583.24i&apos;A December, 1943.WAR CABINET.FERRO-ALLOYS.   THE GERMAN SUPPLY POSITION.Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare.1. Ferro-alloys are needed for special steels essential in war. German stocksof the principal alloys are nearing exhaustion. Germany has drawn heavily upon her reserves of machines and weapons, and is more dependent than ever beforeupon fresh supplies of raw materials. Shortage of these is seriously impedingher war effort already, and every further diminution will produce a more thanproportionate effect. The general conclusion is that Germany is more vulnerablein respect of hardening metals, and particularly in respect of ferro-alloys than atany previous stage in the war.2. The principal materials involved are molybdenum, nickel, tungsten,chrome and manganese. A note on the uses and sources of each will be found inthe Annex to this Memorandum. Molybdenum, nickel and chrome are inter-changeable with one another more readily than with tungsten. The main use ofmanganese is not as an alloy. It is essential for the general processes of steelmanufacture and is only mentioned in this memorandum because of its greatgeneral importance.3. About 70 per cent, of Germany&apos;s molybdenum and nickel comes from norway and Finland respectively, and so can only be dealt with by direct attackon the mines themselves, or during transportation. The recent air attack on theNorwegian molybdenum mines is believed to have brought them to a standstill forseveral weeks.Wolfram (the ore from which tungsten is derived) comes almost entirely from spain and Portugal, apart from such consignments from the Far East as maysuccessfully run the blockade.Chrome comes partly from Greece and Yugoslavia, where it is a constanttarget for attacks by Partisans, and partly from Turkey.About 50 per cent, of Germany&apos;s manganese comes from Nikopol, nowgravely threatened by the Russians.4. It seems illogical that whilst the Swedes and the Swiss, whose countries are surrounded by the enemy, have agreed to make heavy cuts in 1944 in their supplies of war material and other commodities of first importance to enemyEurope, the three neutrals with free access to the outside world, two of who mare our Allies, should still be sending vital quantities of chrome and wolfram toGermany. For political reasons it has not yet been thought expedient to bringeconomic pressure to bear upon the Governments concerned. The Americans areurging us to adopt a firmer line in the Iberian Peninsula, and may takeindependent action. It is clearly important to concert our policy in this matter with the United States Administration at the earliest possible moment,5. The export of wolfram from Portugal to Germany is at present limited by the Portuguese Government to a maximum of 2,100 tons a year, this maximumincluding the products of both German- and neutral-owned mines. ThePortuguese &quot;wolfram year &quot; begins on the 1st March, and last year, without,any previous warning to us, Dr. Salazar tied his hands for 12 months, by making an agreement with the Germans, under which the latter obtained a ceiling of2,100 tons. He may well present us with a similar fait accompli this year, unless we can effect a radical alteration in his approach to this problem. We estimate[26618]
that actual exports of wolfram to Germany from Portugal will amount to about,000 tons for the current &quot; wolfram year &quot; ending on the 29th February next.6. In Spain the market is not subject to official control. The Germans owna number of small mines, and the remaining ore is subject to competitive buyingbetween the Germans and ourselves. Both we and the enemy have found con-siderable difficulty in financing our purchases, and for several months theGermans have been out of the market, though we believe that they are about tore-enter it. We estimate the actual exports of wolfram to Germany from Spainduring 1943 at about 1,000 tons, though certain further amounts, about which wehave no information, may have been smuggled out of the country.7. As we draw our own supplies of wolfram from United Nations sources,the ideal solution would be an embargo on the export of any wolfram from bothSpain and Portugal. But such an embargo would draw the strongest possibleprotests from the Germans, and can hardly be regarded as practical politicseither in Spain, where General Franco is far from friendly, or in Portugal, whereDr. Salazar in economic matters is sternly neutral and would certainly contend that an embargo would invite a German attack on Portuguese ships and cities.8. So long as the Germans can pay the Spanish export tax, we cannotprevent them importing from Spain the produce of their own mines, which isestimated at about 50 tons a month. Nor can we hope to be 100 per cent,successful in out-bidding them in the open market, though we have a large buyingorganisation on the spot and have reason to hope that the German purchasingmachinery will have been considerably damaged by their temporary absence fromthe market. It seems that the only way in which a really effective reduction in spanish exports of wolfram to Germany could be effected would be to get the spaniards to fix and enforce a low ceiling under threat from the Americans and ourselves of a heavy cut in Spanish imports from overseas. It would clearly be extremely difficult and largely useless to make such a threat without a substantial reduction in Portuguese exports. We cannot tackle Spain until we have tackledPortugal successfully.9. The Portuguese problem is even more difficult than the Spanish problem,since we have to reckon not only with Dr. Salazar&apos;s &quot; neutrality &quot; complex, butalso with his conviction that His Majesty&apos;s Government attach less importanceto wolfram than the Ministry of Economic Warfare maintain. Moreover, whenthe Portuguese Government agreed to give us facilities in the Azores, we under-took to do our&quot; best to make certain supplies available to Portugal from theUnited Kingdom and the United States. His Majesty&apos;s Government aretherefore precluded from threatening the Portuguese with economic sanctions,and I believe that the only hope of effecting a substantial reduction in Portugueseexports to the enemy is to put the case to Dr. Salazar at the highest level, stressingparticularly our alliance, and the military importance of wolfram under war conditions.10. Under the Clodius and subsequent Turco-German Agreements, Turkeyundertook to supply Germany with 90,000 tons of chrome in 1943 and the same amount in 1944 in return for German armaments. Provided that the Germansfulfil their undertakings under these Agreements, the Turks cannot refusedelivery of chrome without dishonouring their written word and giving directprovocation to the Germans. This is the contention which they have put forward in the past and would no doubt put forward if approached again. They are,however, interposing every kind of administrative delay, especially as regardstransport, and taking advantage of every German failure to comply exactlywith German engagements, in order to delay deliveries of chrome on Germanaccount, with the result that instead of 90,000 tons rather less than 40.000 was actually exported to Germany up to the 25th November last. There is no reasonto expect that the Germans will obtain more in 1944 and it might well be less.The position of the Turkish Government is thus different from that of thePortuguese Government and, however deplorable it may be, unless and until theTurks actually come into the war on our side, it seems hopeless to ask for orexpect more from them than they are doing already.11.   I ask my colleagues : (a) To take note of Germany&apos;s critical shortage of the chief ferro-alloys, andof the importance of maintaining and increasing that shortage byeverv ??possible means.
(&amp;) To consider what further operations can be taken against ferro-alloysources of supply in enemy and enemy-occupied territory.(c) To consider how an approach can best be made to Dr. Salazar with theobject of effecting a substantial reduction in Portuguese exports of wolfram to Germany. Before any action is taken the United states authorities should be consulted as to our whole economic policy inregard to Spain and Portugal.&apos; ;        -&quot;&apos; -   : S. &apos;$Ministry of Economic Warfare, W.1,2Uh December, 1943.ANNEX.Chrome.Chrome is used with other alloys to strengthen steel, particularly inconnexion with armour plating in armaments such as tanks, gun shields, &amp;c.About 15 per cent, of the enemy supplies in 1943 came from Greece (round thegulf of Salonika).About 45 per cent, came from Yugoslavia (Skoplje).About 10 per cent, came from other Balkan sources.The remaining 30 per cent, came from Turkey in Asia (mainly from theGuleman area in the Eastern Provinces).Manganese.Manganese is used as an alloy in some special steels. It differs howeverfrom the other ferro-alloys in that a small percentage of manganese is an essentialconstituent in the general processes of steel manfacture. Its fundamentalnecessity in ordinary steel makes it essential for the maintenance of industrial life in a modern State.Rather less than 50 per cent, of the enemy, supplies in 1943 came from GermanEurope (Germany itself, Czechoslovakia, Roumania, Bulgaria, Hungary andNorthern ItalvhThe remainder came from Nikopol.We do not think that the Germans can increase production in GermanEurope if they lose the Nikopol mines.On the other hand, though the loss of Nikopol would substantially reduce theGerman steel output, Germany would certainly concentrate on the special steelsfor which ferro-alloys are needed, so that the demand for those alloys would notbe reduced.Molybdenum.Molybdenum is used to toughen steel in depth (as opposed to case hardening).About 70 per cent, of the enemy supplies in 1943 came from Norway(Knaben).About 20 per cent, came from Finland (the Karelian isthmus).About 10 per cent, came from Roumania.Nickel.Nickel is used both to toughen steel and to give it corrosion-resisting quality.About 65 per cent, of the enemy supplies in 1943 came from Finland(Petsamo).About 15 per cent, came from Greece (near the Gulf of Corinth).About 10 per cent, came from Norway (Evje in South-west Norway).The remaining 10 per cent, came from Saxony.Wolfram.Wolfram is mainly used for cutting tools which are essential for everyprocess of armament production.It is also necessary for electric lamp filaments, radio valves, and syntheticpetrol production.It has recently acquired a new importance in the manufacture of armour-piercing projectiles, principally for anti-tank use.Practically the whole of the enemy supplies in 1943 came from the iberian peninsula (about 2,100 tons from Portugal, and 1,000 tons from Spain).
