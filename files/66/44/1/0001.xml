THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 194.3.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.W.P. (43) 551.6th December, 1943.WAR CABINET.REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON BASIC ENGLISH.APPOINTMENT, TEEMS OF REFERENCE, AND CONSTITUTION OFTHE COMMITTEE.1. At their Meeting on the 12th July, 1943 (W.M.(43) 97th Conclusions,Minute 3), the War Cabinet appointed a Committee consisting of -The Secretary of State for India (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The President of the Board of Education,The Minister of Information,The Secretary, Department of Overseas Trade,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Parliamentary Secretary, Board of Education,with the following terms of reference : -&quot; To consider whether action should be taken to promote the spread of basic English, and, if so, to recommend a programme of action.&quot; It should be open to the Committee to consider alternatives to BasicEnglish, such as &apos; Essential English.&apos; &quot;2. In the absence from this country of the Secretary of State for theColonies, meetings of the Committee were attended by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs attended only the final meeting of the Committee, on account, in the firstplace, of his absence from this country, and latterly, on account of the change inthe holder of this office.Proceedings of the Committee.3. The Committee have considered a great quantity of written evidence from linguistic experts and from persons or bodies with a practical experience ofthe teaching of English to foreigners.(a) Linguistic Experts.Mr. C. K. Ogden, the inventor of Basic English, provided a comprehensiveMemorandum presenting the case.for Basic in all aspects. The inventors orexponents of other systems similarly submitted Memoranda, namely, the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, on behalf of the delegates of the OxfordUniversity Press (Oxford Progressive English), Mr. C. E. Eckersley (&quot; EssentialEnglish &quot;), and Dr. Harold E. Palmer (&quot; 1,000-word English&quot;). These othersystems were all the products of a school of thought opposed to Basic as-a teachingmethod, and making use of vocabularies selected according to the frequency of words in ordinary writing or speech. A useful Memorandum was. provided byMr. I. J. Pitman, Director of Organisation and Method at the Treasury, stressingthe need for some standardisation to avoid increasing corruption of the english language by &quot;backward peoples.&quot;[26466] p
(b) Persons and Organisations with Teaching Experience.Written evidence was submitted by the British Council; and Mr. H.Brissenden and Professor H. R. Hamley, who had recently returned from educa-tional missions for the Council in South America and the Middle Eastrespectively, were interviewed by the Chairman. They were opposed to Basic as ateaching method. Wing-Commander Biles, until recently Inspector of LanguageInstruction at the Air Ministry, reported adversely on Basic as a method whichhad been tried for the teaching of English to Allied air forces in this, country;while Brigadier J. G. Smyth, in an interview with the Chairman, gave an accountof its success with a class that he had conducted for Indian Officers. MajorHamilton-Gordon described his methods of teaching colloquial English at aprivate Institute in Paris, with a note on the unsuitability of Basic for such a purpose. An article by Dr. W. B. Mumford, describing how progress could bemade from Basic to wider English, was circulated to the Committee.The Colonial Office obtained the views, of Colonial educational authorities,which proved very conflicting. In Africa, Basic had not achieved generalpopularity, partly on account of a tendency for the natives to consider it aninferior substitute for the full English that they wished to acquire. Successfulexperiments in its use had, however, been carried out in Ceylon and in Zanzibar.Generally speaking, the prevailing lack of uniformity in methods of instructionwas not found to be a handicap. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor the Colonies also interviewed four experts from the Colonies at present inthis country. The view of two of these tended to be more favourable to Basic,Mr. Purcell, in particular, commenting on its success when used by him in ChineseSchools in Malaya, and later in China; but the two African representatives were inclined to be hostile to it.Its success and widespread adoption in China was also confirmed byMr. Ogden. The Educational Commissioner with the Government of Indiareported adversely on Basic for use in India, though it was understood to have met with some success as developed there under the auspices of the Times of india of Bombay, and had been adopted in some of the native States. The Board ofEducation indicated that they would be opposed to its introduction into Englishschools; except at an advanced stage and for special purposes.(e) Other Written Evidence.The views of the B.B.C. were obtained, and a report made on experimentalbroadcast recordings in Basic English. The conclusions of an international commission which had considered proposals for an Auxiliary World Languagewere made available to the Committee. The texts of some American news bulletinsin Basic, and an account of experiments in Basic English film production were also considered; as were several Basic English books, including the NewTestament, together with some of the text-books of the other methods, and an address to the Royal Society of Arts by Dr. I. A. Richards.(d) Oral Evidence.Mr. C. K. Ogden, Mr. C. E. Eckersley, Mr. E. C. Parnwell (Oxford UniversityPress), Wing-Commander H. C, Biles and Mr. I. J. Pitman, gave evidence beforethe Committee as a whole, and the Chairman also interviewed ProfessorErnest Barker.Report of the Committee.4. Basic English was originally devised by Mr. C. K. Ogden as a universalinternational auxiliary language for scientific, commercial and general inter-communication. It was created out of English because English is the most widelydiffused language, not only as the native tongue of some two hundred million people in the British Empire and the United States, but also as the administrativelanguage and language of intercourse of nearly five hundred million more in Indiaand the British Colonies, and increasingly becoming the foreign language moststudied in other countries. There was, however, another reason for makingEnglish the starting point of his work. That was the simple analytical structure of the language and the range of its vocabulary, which made it possible byscientific selection to cover the widest possible field of ideas with a minimumnumber of words. In doing this the inventor of Basic was greatly assisted bya characteristic feature of English, which is its use of certain simple verbs ofaction, combined with appropriate nouns and prepositions, to take the place of
other more specific verbs. By a bold feat of concentration he, in fact, eliminatedthe whole range of ordinary verbs, substituting for them some eighteen simple&quot;operator&quot; verbs used in conjunction with nouns which are already in.hisvocabulary for other purposes.5. In this way Basic has been able to compress the whole range of ideasrequired for simple intercourse into a vocabulary of 850 words. For the purposesof any special subject, e.g., science, engineering, business, military operations, this list would want increasing by something like a hundred words peculiar to thespecial subject.6: The striking fact about this remarkable performance is that the result is still perfectly adequate English. It involves certain circumlocutions andsubstitutions which tend to make anything written in Basic somewhat prolix andflat in style, and no one could suggest its ever becoming a substitute either forliterary English or for idiomatic, colloquial English. All the same, it is notonly clear and intelligible, but the difference between it and normal Englishmay easily escape the notice of the ordinary reader for pages at a time, whilebroadcasts have been delivered in Basic without attracting the comments of thelarge body of listeners, who at once draw the attention of the B.B.C. to any newfeature which they dislike. Basic has been developed to a very wide extent, andon identical lines, by Dr. Ivor Richards in the United States, and quite asubstantial literature of books turned into Basic is already available for students.7. As a secondary feature, Mr. Ogden and many others haVe also advocatedBasic as a first stage and useful method of approach to the learning of normal orwider English. They contend that the student who concentrates on thoroughlygrounding himself in the Basic vocabulary approaches the next stage in learningnormal English with the disciplined confidence that he can express himself, evenif sometimes in a roundabout fashion, on every subject so as to be clearly under-stood by any English reader or listener. They also claim that new words, andparticularly the verbs which are designedly omitted from Basic, can be easilypicked up afterwards. There are progressive courses for the expansion of Basicinto wider English, and a dictionary in which the meaning of some twentythousand words of wider English is explained in terms of Basic, so that the Basicgrounded student can without difficulty enlarge his knowledge for himself. Basichas undoubtedly been applied with success as an approach to normal English invarious parts of the world. Such evidence as we have before us would suggestthat it is at any rate an improvement on the more unscientific methods of teachingEnglish which used to be in vogue.8.&apos; In recent years, however, the teaching of English, i.e., normal English,for its own sake, has been the subject of much scientific inquiry. A variety of methods of teaching English by progressive stages through vocabularies based oha careful analysis of word frequencies in conversational and literary Englishhave been developed and have met with widespread success. Of these the bestknown are &quot; Essential English,&quot; worked out by Mr. C. E. Eckersley, which has proved particularly useful and popular for adult students, and the &apos;&apos; OxfordProgressive &quot; method, which has hitherto concentrated mainly and verysuccessfully on the teaching of children. The advocates of these methods contend that they are more natural, both in so far as they teach the student from thebeginning the kind of English that he will come across in ordinary intercourseand in the books and newspapers which he picks up, and also because the Basicmethod, with its omission of the ordinary verbs, though scientific, does not correspond with the normal psychology of languages other than perhaps Chinese,and that, therefore, the student grounded in Basic has to readjust his languagestructure when he comes to normal English, and unlearn instincts and phrasespreviously acquired.9. While the differences between the various methods of approach are apt to be exaggerated by the competing schools of thought, the evidence before ustends on the whole to the conclusion that, considered purely as a method for thelearning of ordinary English, Basic is found artificial and relatively unattractiveby students who, outside the classroom, have opportunities of frequent contact with spoken or written English. Nor does its scientifically interlocking structuremake it seem equally well suited for the teaching of children a*s methods whichbegin with all the commonest words and with the more elementary verbs of,action.The evidence before us would certainly suggest that the other methods arepreferred in most European, Middle Eastern and South American countries and,[26466] * 2
on the whole, though with some marked exceptions, by educational authorities inIndia and the British Colonies. It should be stated, however, that Basic has beenvery successfully taught in some parts of India and has been favoured by the educational authorities of many Indian States, and that it has been verysuccesfully employed in Ceylon. It is interesting to note that in Malaya it hasbeen the most successful system with Chinese students, though not with Malayansor Indians, possibly owing to the fact that the Chinese language, like Basic,practically does without verbs We understand that in the Yunnan province of China itself it is the officially approved system of teaching English, and thatits use is permitted in other Chinese schools, though without official adoptionas the only authorised system.10. In any case, so far as teaching ordinary English for its own sake isconcerned, we see no reason for any recommendation that would in any wayprejudice the excellent work done by other methods aimed at leading more directly to idiomatic colloquial English or to a fuller comprehension of all the vast range and infinitely varied shades of expression embodied in the glorious treasure houseof English literature. The choice of methods most suitable for this purpose canwell be left to the education authorities of the different countries concerned, to private bodies like the British Institutes abroad, and, finally,, to the individualstudent, in the light of practical experience.11. On the other hand, the evidence before us has convinced us that thereis undoubtedly an important field for the development of an auxiliary inter-national language such as Basic provides. The value of such a medium is likelyto be greatest in two main directions. Firstly, as a medium of intercourse andfor the diffusion of useful information between business men, technicians andscientists, as well as for travellers, in all non-English-speaking countries.Secondly, although we recognise that this should first be tested by experiment, we feel that Basic might be found to be useful to some Colonial Administrationsfor the diffusion of information of all kinds bearing on the current work ofadministration, and more particularly on such matters as agriculture, sanitation,personal hygiene, &amp;c. The use of Basic for this purpose should be in supplementof, and not in substitution for, the similar use of established literary languages.It must be remembered that in most Colonial areas there are no developed literarylanguages generally understood within the area, but more usually a whole numberof undeveloped and mutually unintelligible languages spoken by different tribesor elements in the community. A handbook on personal hygiene, for instance,in relation to malaria or other tropical diseases, published in Singapore, wouldbe intelligible, on the assumption that Basic was widely understood, not only tothe Malayan, Indian and Chinese inhabitants of Malaya, but to those of ceylon and West Africa and East Africa and the Pacific Islands in the British Empireand, indeed, also to those of 6ther tropical countries and colonies.12. It will be obvious that, for all the above purposes, the value of some-thing in the nature of a standard simplified English will be enormously enhanced by its progressive diffusion. Only, indeed, as it approaches universality andbecomes a natural medium of communication for broadcasting stations andpublishers all over the world, would such an auxiliary language, or language code,make its full contribution to human intercourse and understanding. Nor is there any reason why its expansion, for certain important but still essentially limitedpurposes, should interfere with either the common speech or the literary develop-ment of those richer forms which enshrine the linguistic traditions and instinctsof the world&apos;s varied national cultures.13. In this connection it has been suggested to us that the diffusion of a standard universal first-stage English might serve, not only to pave the way toa wider knowledge of full English, but also to preserve that English itself.English in some form, so it is argued, was bound to spread in any case. Thedanger is that, like Latin on the downfall of the Roman Empire, it may getdebased, and that local forms of &quot; pidgin English &quot; may develop on their own- andsupplant, or at any rate infect, the present language. A universal standardVocabulary, simple enough to be easily learnt, and naturally linked with normalliterary English, would, it is suggested, afford a real protection against this danger.14. The use of Basic English as a standard international auxiliary neednot, of course, prejudge the question of the best methods of teaching English forits own sake. Basic is not only intelligible to everyone who normally speaks
English but should in practice be no less intelligible to non-English-speakingpeople learning English by other methods, once they have advanced beyond themost elementary stage. More than half the vocabulary of Basic English is coveredby the first thousand words in any of the progressive systems based on wordfrequency and almost all the rest in the next thousand words. Any studenttherefore who has made reasonable progress in English by any method should beable to understand Basic even though he would himself use words and idioms not found in Basic. We append (Annex &quot; A &quot;) a Basic English War Diary, published in Lagos, and a translation of it into &quot; Oxford Progressive English &quot; at the1,000-word stage.fRecommendations.15. On the understanding that nothing in our recommendations shall pre-judice the development of the normal fluency methods referred to in paragraph 10,we have come to the conclusion that definite encouragement should be given to thedevelopment of Basic English as an auxiliary international and administrativelanguage, in the following directions : (a) We consider that it should be part of the duties of our diplomatic and commercial representatives in foreign countries to encourage and assist the spread of Basic English, in so far as may be practicable,for its specific purpose as an auxiliary medium of internationalcommunication.(b) We consider that the British Council should include among its activitiesthe teaching of Basic English, in so far as may be practicable, not in substitution for its more general activities in promoting the teaching of English for its own sake, but for its more limited specific function.(c) We recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government, through the appropriateMinistry, should give substantial financial assistance to the Ortho-logical Institute for the work of translating into Basic English a wider range of literature, scientific, technical and general, both fromordinary English and from foreign languages, than is at present available, as well as more generally for its manuals and for the exten-sion of its activities in other countries.(d) We suggest that the Ministry of Information should itself make use of basic, where suitable, for some of its own publications.(e) We also recommend that the Colonial Office should consider to what extent the experiment might be tried in selected areas of the issue in basic English of handbooks for the use of colonial peoples on suchsubjects as agriculture, hygiene, &amp;c, and whether there are anycolonial Governments which might usefully be invited to consider theissue of their administrative instructions, such as Governmentcirculars, in language simplified to conform as close as may be to the limitations of the Basic vocabulary. We append in this connection a recent official press notice, in itself by no means markedly officialesein diction, concerning British Honduras lumbermen, and its Basicversion (Annex &quot; B &quot;).(/) We consider that a substantial portion of the material sent out overseasby the B.B.C., both in the form of news and of general talks, shouldbe in Basic English, and that the B.B.C, should also include the teaching of Basic English in its programme. For these purposes anadditional allocation of funds may be necessary, more particularly forthe provision of trained editorial staff.These recommendations are interconnected. The diffusion of basic by the B.B.C. would be of great assistance and encouragement to the teaching of Basic .in other countries where the organisation toprovide it is in existence. On the other hand, in the absence of anysuch organisation capable of expansion, it would be largely a wastedeffort.18. The above recommendations will, if approved, involve the working out ofa good many details for their application. We suggest that the Chairman and secretary of the Committee be authorised to discuss these with the B.B.C., theGovernment Departments concerned, the British Council, and with Mr. Ogden.For this purpose they should, in the first instance, consult with a small committee
of official representatives of the departments concerned. Such a committee willin any case be required subsequently for the purpose of keeping in touch with,and co-ordinating, the various agencies engaged in the spreading of Basic English.19. We have been greatly indebted to our Secretary, Mr. A. N. Coleridge,for his work in collecting a great mass of useful material, as well as for personalinterviews with representatives of different schools of thought.(Signed.) L. S. AMERY,R. A.

CHUTER EDE,DEVONSHIRE.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.ANNEX &quot;-A.&quot;&quot; Basic &quot; A War Diary, Nigeria, 3th October, 1941.From Russia comes news of more German attacks in the middle. Here theyare making great attempts to get through to Moscow. But the Russians are doing everything possible to put a stop to these attacks.In the North round Leningrad the Germans have not been able to make anymore forward moves.   In the South they have been able to go forward.In one day&apos;s air fighting the Russians smashed 42 German aeroplanes, their losses were 27.     - .   &quot;In the Mediterranean our Navy has again done good work. Eleven moreenemy ships have been damaged or sent to the bottom. Two of these were oilships and others were full of soldiers and stores for North Africa from Italy.As a sign of their desire to give help to the Free French, America has senttwo representatives to Brazzaville, the chief town of Free French equaltorial africa.   One is an Army officer and the other is an officer of the American Navy.The R.A.F. has made more attacks on- the Italians. The harbours ofBenghazi and Tripoli were bombed and great damage was done to harbour works and ships. In addition Italian air bases at Marsala, Catania and Gerbini,Locata and Trapani were attacked.A new and interesting book has come out this week. It is the story of our bombers. On the first day there were 3,000,000 of these books put out, and almost all were taken up in one day. This book will be in twenty-five languages. before long this book will be seen in Africa.There is trouble in Italy. Food is getting very short. The bread is very bad, meat is to be had only on one day of the week, and then it is horse meat.Even fish is short.The Nazis are everywhere and the Italians are tired of their Germanmasters. Fights often take place between the Germans and Italians. If itwere not for Mussolini and His German friends the people of Italy would behappy to make peace with us.Men and women in the countries under German control have a very hardlife. The men have to work very hard for very little money, and the women arenot able to get enough food for their families. This is so in Norway. Here theGerman Governor has said that it is not necessary for the Germans to set asideany food for the Norwegians. He said the Germans did not care if somethousands of Norwegians and their families were dead because there was no food.The Germans are a very cruel people.(Nine extra words used.)
Translation into Oxford Progressive English (1,000-Word Stage).News comes from Russia of further attacks by the Germans in the centre,where they are driving toward Moscow. But the Russians are doing everything in their power to stop them.In the North, near Leningrad, the Germans have not been able to go forward,but they have pushed on in the South.During one day&apos;s fighting in the air the Russians destroyed 42 Germanaeroplanes and lost 27 of their own. -In the Mediterranean our warships have again done well. Eleven moreenemy ships were hit and some of them sank. Two carried oil, and others were taking soldiers and stores from Italy to North Africa.In order to show that they want to help the Free French, the AmericanGovernment have sent two officers to Brazzaville, the chief town of Free french equatorial Africa.   One came from the army and the other from the navy.The R.A.F. has again attacked the Italians. Benghazi and Tripoli were bombed, and much harm was done to the harbours and ships there. Italian aircentres at Marsala, Catania and Gerbini, Locata and Trapani were also attacked.An interesting new book has appeared this week in England. It tells the story of our bombers. On the first day nearly three million copies were sold.This book is also being printed in twenty-four other languages, and soon it willbe seen in Africa.Italy is in trouble. Food is becoming short. The bread is very poor.Horse meat is the one kind of meat supplied, and it may only be sold on one day in the week.   It is even difficult to get fish.The Italians are.tired of their Nazi masters, who are seen in all parts ofthe country. There is often fighting between the Germans and the Italians, andit is only Mussolini and his German friends who keep the Italian people at warwith us.Men and women in the countries under German rule live unhappy lives.The men are obliged to work very hard for very little money, and the womencannot get enough food for their families. An example of this is found in norway, where the German Ruler has stated that it is not necessary to supply the Norwegians with food. He has even said that the Germans will not worry if some thousands of Norwegians and their families die of hunger. The germans are a very cruel people.(Words in italics are not in the Oxford first 1,000 words.)ANNEX &quot;B.&quot;Press Notice by the Colonial Office.Owing to the more favourable turn which the shipping situation has taken and the possibility which now exists of obtaining more timber from abroad, it hasbeen decided to arrange for the repatriation of some of the overseas ForestryUnits which have made such a valuable contribution to the war effort in theUnited Kingdom.Among the Units, which would be repatriated are the British HondurasForestry Units, and His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to take this opportunityof expressing their great appreciation of the fine work which these Units haveperformed over a period during which there was an acute shortage in the war-timetimber supplies of the United KingdomPreparations are being made for the return of these Units to british honduras, but any members of the Units who volunteer to remain in the UnitedKingdom and engage in other forms of war-time employment will be affordedan opportunity to do so, provided that employment suitable for their qualificationsis available.Same Notice, in Basic English.Because the war on the sea is going well for us now and we have enough ships to be able to get the wood necessary for the war from other countries, the decision has been made that some of the Forestry Units who came here from overseas andhave given such great help to the work of the war may go back to their own landagain.
Among the Units which will go back are the British Honduras Forestry-Units, and His Majesty&apos;s Government takes this chance to say publicly how higha value they put on the good work which these Units have been doing at this timewhen the store of wood necessary for keeping the war going was very low in thiscountry.Now these Units are getting ready to go back to British Honduras, but if anyof the men make up their minds not to go back with their friends but to do someother kind of war work here, they will be given the chance, if there is room forthem here in the kind of work they are able to do well.
