A convoy of 13 ships,,including destroyers, corvettes and large cargo ships, was sighted in Wasile and Weda Bays (Halmahera Island, Moluccas)probably conveying stores and equipment for air bases under construction.Anti-Submarine Operations.11. Twenty-three attacks on U-boats have been reported : nine by shore-based aircraft, one by carrier-borne aircraft and 13 by surface craft. OneU-boat was sunk by U.S. aircraft east of Ascension Island. One U-boat was probably sunk by H.M. frigates Blackwood and Bazely north of the Azores andin the same area ships of an escort group possibly damaged another.A large number of U-boats were in the vicinity of a homeward-bound convoyeast of the Azores during the night of the 27th/28th.

Japanese U-boats are reported to be using their aircraft to locate possible reinforcements for the Eastern front, and have made recon-reconnaissances of Kilindini and the Seychelles during the week.Enemy Attack on Shipping.14. LT-boats are reported to have torpedoed three independently routedships, south-east of Freetown, south-west of Addu Atoll and in the Gulf of Adenrespectively.An eastbound troop convoy was twice heavily attacked by aircraft in theMediterranean; on the 26th one ship in the convoy was sunk off Bougie when30 enemy aircraft (probably including a number of He. 177s) attacked, of whichten were destroyed (seven by fighters). On the 29th the s.s.

During the week ending the 28th, 917 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these, 338 ships were in ocean convoys and 579 in British coastal[26497] . b
convoys. One escort carrier, 53 destroyers and 121 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes (including 12 U.S. cutters) were employed on escort duties.Four homebound ocean convoys, consisting of 170 ships, and five outward bound convoys, consisting of 168 ships, arrived at their destinations without loss.16. Aircraft from H.M.S. Fencer (escort carrier) escorting a south-bound convoy, shot down a F.W. 200 in the S.W. Approaches on the 1st.Allied Minelaying.17. Mines, were laid by surface craft off the north coast of France, and by aircraft off the Frisian Islands, off the north-coast of France and off Biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.18. On the 26th, E-boats laid mines in the approaches to Portsmouth, where two large dangerous areas have been declared and the port has been closed exceptfor inshore channels. Enemy surface craft are believed to have laid mines south-west of Boulogne on the night of the 27th /28th.Minelaying by one enemy aircraft was suspected off Harwich on the 25th.One ground and 11 moored mines have been destroyed off the East Coast, and the mine totals are : 4,519 ground and 3,927 moored/19.

The German s.s. Johannes Maersk (1,899 tons) sailed from Istanbul forBurgaz on the 21st with a cargo of 2,500 tons of chrome for Germany.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern and Central Sectors.21. There has been little activity apart from local fighting in the NevelSector, where the Germans claim to have gained some ground.Gomel Sector.22. On the 25th the Russians crossed the River so  on a wide front andadvanced up to 30 miles, crossing the Dnieper north-east of Rogachev. As a result&apos;of this thrust and of further progress north-westwards from Rechitsa, Gomel wasisolated and the Germans evacuated it on the 26th. Since then the Russians have advanced northwards along the railway some two-thirds of the way to Zhlobin.Further south the Russians have made considerable progress on a wide front and have reached the railway Mozyr-Ovruch.Kiev Sector.23. The Germans made little further progress east of Zhitomir, but theyextended their attacks northwards to Korosten, which they have now recapturedfrom the Russians. Reports indicate that weather and ground conditions have deteriorated on this part of the front during the past week. This fact,combined with determined Russian resistance, has prevented the Germans from-obtaining the decisive success which they hoped to achieve with these counter-attacks.Dnieper Bend.24. Heavy fighting has taken place at the Cherkasi bridgehead, which theRussians extended on the 29th to a point 10 miles south-south-west of Cherkasi.Fighting has also been reported in the areas south of Kremenchug and south-east of Nikopol, where the Russians have gained local successes.1 Crimea. -25.   There have been no further developments in the Crimea.
General.26. The capture of Gomel and the steady progress both in that area andsouth of Mosyr are a considerable success for the Russians. It is believed that, theGermans are suffering from a shortage of armour in this sector. ..In spite of the recapture of Korosten the German attacks in the Kiev sectorhave not achieved any outstanding success. The Russians have been on the defensive here and have been forced to yield a certain amount of ground duringthe past fortnight, but there are still no signs that their positions are in serious danger.Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)27. A slight improvement in the weather enabled the Eighth Army to launch a full-scale attack during the night of 27th/28th against the strongly-fortifiedGerman positions on the high ground overlooking the Sangro River. During theprevious week, despite rain, mud, the swollen river and enemy shelling, the 78th,8th Indian -and 2nd New Zealand Divisions had gradually extended their bridge-head and built up reserves preparatory to the assault, which was preceded by&apos;the customary artillery barrage and received maximum air support. Germanreaction has been violent, taking the form of powerful counter-attacks assisted by the use of tanks and flame-throwers. Places have changed hands several times,but by midday on the 1st our troops had secured the ridge about five miles longrunning inland from Fossacesia, inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy and.captured 1,000 prisoners together with a quantity of guns, motor transport andequipment.Elsewhere on the Eighth Army front there has been considerable patrolactivity but little change in the main positions. Canadian patrols report thatthe Germans have set fire to a number of villages including Villa St. Maria.Castel Di Sangro is now in British hands. Enemy demolitions have become increasingly thorough since the beginning of the campaign; aerial bombs, heavyshells and blocks of mines are frequently used as explosives, and the germans are destroying all buildings which might serve the Allies as billets..28. There is little change on the Fifth Army front where the Germansappear to be bringing in another division. Artillery duels are frequent andaggressive patrolling continues. On. the American sector several hill featureshave been captured. Frequent reports come in of the large percentage of dudshells among the enemy&apos;s ammunition.29. The general administrative situation is satisfactory. During the weekending the 27th, discharges at the ports totalled 235,257 tons of, stores, 8,258vehicles and 43,919 personnel, and the pipe line from Manfredonia to the Foggiaairfields discharged 107,000 gallons of 100-octane spirit. The clearance from the docks by rail and road increases, though the systematic destruction of every sleeperon the Naples-Rome railway is now reported.TEgean.30. Patrols of the Special Boat Squadron successfully raided the island of Nisiros on the 24th where, among other things, two caiques were destroyed, andPiscopi (Tilos), where the telegraph to Kos and Nisiros was cut. On the night of 25th/26th Symi was raided and five prisoners taken. Four machine-gun posts,a number of installations and a quantity of stores and, ammunition were destroyed.The bulk of our garrison on Kastellorizo was withdrawn on the night of27th/28th. Long-Range Desert Group patrols have been evacuated from Mykonosand Seriphos.Yugoslavia.31. The Partisans have recovered several localities in the north-west,including Caporetto. Their sabotage attacks on the railway Zagreb-Belgradehave continued.The Germans have left small garrisons on Krk and neighbouring islands and on the 27th started to occupy the islands off Zara. &quot; . * .The Partisans are attempting to restore their communications with the coastnear Split. They are also undertaking operations. near Sarajevo, which arepossibly designed to cut off the town.[26497] B 2
The Germans are assisting Chetniks to repel the Partisan drive intosouth-western Serbia, ; General Mihailovic has ordered a general mobilisationagainst the Partisans and there is strong evidence of his collaboration with Nedic,Head of the Quisling Serb Government.Greece.32. Zervas, the leader of E.D.E.S., has been under continuous pressure fromE.L.A.S. forces under Ares and has withdrawn south-west from Yannina, where he is reported to be in a precarious position and short of food.Supplies have been flown to E.L.A.S. bands in Macedonia and Thessalywhich have been fighting the Germans.The Germans have withdrawn their 1st Mountain Division from the YanninaIt is believed that it is being moved to Yugoslavia.Burma.33. In Arakan activity has been confined to patrolling. On the 28th an indian battalion carried out a successful raid against the Japanese, who areholding a ridge some eight miles north-east of Fort White in the Chin Hills.After fierce fighting, during which heavy casualties were inflicted on theJapanese, our troops withdrew.  Our losses were seven killed and 39 wounded.New Guinea.34. On the 25th the Australians captured Sattelberg. Much booty was.found, including anti-tank field guns and mortars.Australian forces, supported by tanks, have also captured Bonga, someten miles north of Finschhafen on the coast.Solomons.35. In Bougainville, U.S. Marines have made further progress north-east of Cape Torokina where a fresh landing is reported to have taken place.Gilbert Islands.36. By the 23rd all opposition had ceased on Makin Island. U.S. casualtiesamounted to 65 killed and 142 wounded. Japanese casualties have not yet beenreported.On Tarawa Atoll enemy opposition is now confined to about 60 remnants inthe north-east&apos;of the Island. U.S. casualties amount to 1,000 missing and 2,500wounded, whilst reports state that most of the Japanese garrison, estimated at,500, have been killed.r &quot;China.37. A Japanese column, estimated at about 20,000 men, has been advancingfrom the north on Changteh, an important rice market town in Hunan Province.Its object was probably to seize the crops, as the strength of the column was insufficient to hold the area permanently.AIR SITUATION.General Review.38. By day, U.S. heavy bombers attacked Bremen and Solingen and, at.night, aircraft of Bomber Command operated against Frankfurt, Berlin andStuttgart.The U-Boat base at Toulon was attacked by U.S. heavy bombers based onNorth Africa.In close support of the Fifth Army, Allied aircraft heavily attacked enemy positions.United Kingdom.39. In daylight, one enemy aircraft was over Kent. On four nights a totalof 28 enemy aircraft were reported overland, and on two nights four of thesereached the London area.   One Me. 410 was damaged by a Mosquito.
Home Waters.. 40. An attack by five R.P. Beaufighters on a convoy off the west coast of norway resulted in several hits on two ships of 3,000 and 1,500 tons respectively.The s.s. Munsterland (6,408 tons) in Cherbourg Harbour was attacked on three occasions by escorted Whirlwind bombers and an escorted Mosquitoattacked the ex-Italian s.s. Pietro Orseolo (6,344 tons) off the Isle de croix; nohits are claimed on either ship and the Mosquito is missing.Four Mosquitoes, one of which failed to return, destroyed three Ju. 88 in the bay of Biscay; another Ju. 88 was destroyed off the Shetlands.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 166 were despatched, laid 485 sea-mines in enemy waters; two bombers are missing and a third crashed in thiscountry.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.41. Heavy bombers of the U.S. with Air Force operated on four days of the week against targets in Germany, a total of 1,556 aircraft being despatched.The two major objectives, both of which were attacked twice, were Bremen andSolingen (S.E. of Dusseldorf) and, on the former, 1,530 tons of bombs were dropped and, on the latter, 908 tons. All four attacks were made through cloud and, in the main, results could not be assessed, but individual groups favoured byclear gaps reported their bombing was good. On these operations and on anotherwhich was abandoned, the bombers, 69 of which are missing, destroyed 44 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 31 and damaged 16. Escort, withdrawal cover and fighter sweeps involved 143 squadrons of fighters and these destroyed a further81 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 12 and damaged 26 for the loss of35 aircraft.In the early part of the week, the effort of medium, light and fighter bomberswas mainly directed against military objectives near Gris Nez and Cherbourg,upon which 458 tons of bombs were dropped; it is probable that several of these attacks were every effective. Little enemy fighter opposition was encounteredand, from the 566 bomber sorties despatched, only five aircraft are missing.Fighters on escort duty and on supporting sweeps destroyed five enemy aircraft for the loss of two Spitfires. -Other operations included raids on eight airfields in Northern France andan attack by escorted Mitchells (B. 25), which dropped 34 tons of bombs with good results on an aero-engine factory at Albert . *Night. -42. Adverse weather restricted large-scale operations of Bomber Com-mand to two nights of the week, the 25th/26th and the 26th/27th. The first objective was Frankfurt upon which 224 aircraft dropped 612 tons of bombs.On the following night, Berlin and Stuttgart were bombed by 373 and 154 air-craft respectively, the tonnage dropped being 1,431 and 422. Over Berlin,visibility was good and the attack is considered to have been successful. AtFrankfurt and Stuttgart, where bombing was carried out through cloud, results could not be seen. Of the 890 aircraft despatched on these operations, 45 are missing and eight crashed in this country or in the sea. No photographic cover of the targets is available and in the case of Berlin 18 attempts have been madeto photograph the city since the start of the heavy bombing on the night of the18th/19th, but owing to poor visibility, all have been abortiveMosquitoes made light attacks on Berlin, Essen, Bochtim, Dusseldorf,Duisburg and Cologne.Intruder Mosquitoes of the Allied Expeditionary Air Force bombed fourairfields in Northern France and the Low Countries, and the seaplane base nearBordeaux.South of France. *43. Toulon U-Boat base was attacked by 105 Fortresses (B. 17) escorted by 36 Lightnings (P. 38); 315 tons of bombs were dropped. A number of hits were observed on buildings, dry docks, the arsenal and nearby vessels; severalfires and explosions were seen and extensive damage was caused.

bomber is missing. Marauders (B. 26), escorted by Lightnings (P. 38), wereprevented by bad weather from attacking the airfield at Salon (29 miles N.W.of - Marseilles); of about 20 enemy fighters encountered five were destroyed forthe loss of three bombers.Italy.44. In the immediate vicinity of the eastern battle area and in close supportof the attack by the Eighth Army, Allied aircraft carried out heavy attacks on enemy positions, roads and railways. The heaviest scale of bombing was directedon the areas of Lanciano, Fossacesia, Casoli, Gastel Frentano and Guarduargrele.On the 27th about 450 bombing sorties were flown, 371 tons of bombs being dropped in the Lanciano/Fossacesia area. On the 29th, 319 fighter-bombers madesuccessful attacks on roads and railways in the same area, and on the following day over 400 light and fighter-bombers attacked the Fossacesia/Orsogna road.During the week a total of approximately 1,084 sorties were flown by medium and light bombers and 1,430 sorties by fighter-bombers in these supportingoperations. Very little A.A. fire has been reported, and few enemy aircraftseen; on the 30th five F.W. 190s were shot down, one probably destroyed and six damaged.In the western battle area very little air activity had been reported up todusk on the 30th November.Numerous attacks were made by heavy and medium bombers on railwaysand roads. The rail centre at Rimini (58- miles N.W. of Ancona) was bombedin two attacks by a total of 63 escorted Fortresses (B. 17), and similar aircraft attacked the railway, yards, bridges and viaduct at Grizzana (19 miles S.W. ofBologna), where 101 tons of bombs were dropped. Thirty Fortresses (B. 17)probably obtained three hits on a viaduct at Recco (15 miles E.S.E. of Genoa), andat Dogna (60 miles W.N.W. of Trieste); 39 Liberators (B. 24) made hits on a tunnel and a viaduct. Liberators (B. 24) made low-level attacks on bridges west of Ancona and probably hit a bridge at Falconara. Wellingtons dropped 38 tonsin the Grosseto area, hitting the bridge over the Ombrone River. Mitchells (B. 25)and Marauders (B. 26), bombed railway targets at Ancona, Porto Civitanova,Giulianova (25 miles N.N.W. of Pescara), Monte Molino (15 miles N.W. ofOrvieto) and Albinia (70 miles N.W. of Rome).

Two heavy bombers and one escorting fighterwere lost.
Russia.47. Although adverse weather has prevailed on the front as a whole, there appears to have been a slight improvement in some areas, which has led to-anincrease in Russian air activity compared with last week.The Russian air force continued to support their ground forces wherever possible, and much damage was reported to have been inflicted on enemy troop con-concentrations, tanks and M.T. in the Chernyakov-Brasilov area and south-west ofDnepropetrovsk. The military junctions at Znamenka and Apostolovo were bombed and troop trains are reported to have been damaged.German&apos; air activity was heavier in the Dnieper Bend, where consider-able bomber and close-support forces were employed in defensive engagements,against Russian pressure at Nikopol and south of Krementschug. The russian advance beyond Gomel is not thought to have encountered heavy air opposition,since the main German forces are engaged on the southern front.Burma and India.48. The main weight of the Allied effort was directed against objectives inthe Rangoon area which were attacked on 14 occasions by a total of about 190aircraft, mostly heavy bombers. The targets included Zayatkwin (18 miles N.E.of Rangoon), the storage depot at Insein, the wharf and warehouse area atRangoon and the town of Rangoon itself.

All tankers on Admiralty service are, however, included.(c) A part of the tonnage in these columns brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage (see note (3)).(2) These columns give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair. They do not therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward yoyages to the Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries othw than United Kingdom and Eire.

APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Germany.Mannheim I Ludwigshaven. An immediate interpretation of photographs,taken on 29th November after the attack on 17th /,18th November show that in theI.G. Farben at Ludwigshaven about 20 buildings have been destroyed or damaged.Owing to the heavy devastation already caused in Mannheim it is not easy inan immediate interpretation to see new incidents, but further damage has been caused to Daimler Benz A.G. and to a glass works -and boat-building yard.It is said that the damage caused to I.G. Farben in this attack was heavier,than ever before and that by 23rd November production had still not been recom-menced. Damage to rail installations between Mannheim and Ludwigshavencaused a complete closure for a time.France.Evretuv / Fauville Airfield.   During the U.S.AA.F. attack on the22nd September the petrol dump was hit, and between ten and fifteen thousandgallons of petrol were destroyed in a fire which raged for five hours.
