(43) 589.29th December, 1943.WAR CABINET.IRELAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues, herewith, the text of the letter, which I sent&apos;tothe United States Ambassador on the 17th December, in accordance with.M. (43) 150th Conclusions, Minute 2.Y:ou will remember leaving with me on the 19th September the draft of a proposed communication from the President to Mr. de Valera.* I am sorrythat it has taken so long for me to send you the views of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on this proposal.The draft which you left with me was, as you know, a revised version of adraft which the President had already given to the P nixie J\xin ister at Hyde Parkin August. On his return to England, the Prime Minister at once discussed this draft with his colleagues. But before any conclusion could be reached the seconddraft was received from you. and the matter has since been under carefulconsideration.It was noted that the second draft differed materially from the earlierversion. The earlier draft constituted a public indictment of the Eire Govern-ment&apos;s policy, and a demand that they should sever their relations with the Axisand provide naval and air facilities for the United Nations. The second draft was limited to a confidential suggestion that the Eire Government should assistthe United States by the offer of base facilities, which,. however, might not berequired.While we are most sensible of the friendly motives which have inspired theUnited States Government in proposing this approach, we feel bound to put before you certain serious difficulties which have emerged as the result of ourfurther examination of the proposal.We feel that the United States Government should know the history of pastefforts which have been made by the United Kingdom Government since theoutbreak of the present war to induce Eire to abandon her neutrality. The first occasion was in June 1940, when British fortunes i r were at their lowestebb. At that time the Cabinet sent Mr. Malcolm MacDonald to Dublin to discussthe question of Eire&apos;s entry into the war. His instructions included thepossibility of exploring, as a quid pro quo, some form of union between Eireand Northern Ireland. All that Mr. Malcolm MacDonald obtained from.Mr. de Valera in reply was that he could only contemplate a united Ireland onthe basis of Ireland as a whole being neutral in the war.A. E.Foreign Office, 29th December, 1943.(Most Secret.)My dear Ambassador,Foreign Office,17th December, 1943.* See W.P. (43) 408.12235   [26641]
It might well have been expected that Mr. de Valera&apos;s views would have changed with the progress of the war and as the fortunes of the United Nationsimproved. But when in December 1941, at the time of the entry of the UnitedStates into the war, Lord Cranborne, the Secretary of State for the Dominions,was sent to Dublin to make a further attempt to bring Eire into the war, he received a similar reply. Mr. de Valera made it clear that until the question of partition was settled there was no chance of Eire abandoning her neutrality.And he gave no undertaking that this would happen even then.All the information in the possession of the United Kingdom. Governmentgoes to show that Mr. de Valera&apos;s attitude remains unaltered at the present time.He has recently made it clear in private statements that he strongly disapprovesof the action of neutrals, such as Portugal, in giving facilities to the united nations now that the tide of war is flowing in their favour. &apos; &apos;.&apos;:-&apos;In these circumstances it appears almost certain that Mr. de Valera&apos;,sreaction to the proposed United States approach, whichever form it takes, wouldbe unsatisfactory, but that, as before, he would avoid a direct negative and would seek to cloud the issue by reiterating his grievances in regard to partition.Any reopening of the issue of partition in this form at the present time would, however, be extremely embarrassing to the United Kingdom Government,in view of the very strong views which are widely held on this question, both inGreat Britain and in Northern Ireland.For these reasons, the United Kingdom Government feel that any formalapproach to Mr. de valera by the United States Government on the lines proposed,although it would serve the purpose of putting on record the views of the UnitedStates Government at the present time, would be likely to give rise to acutedifficulties. If there were any immediate need for naval and air facilities in southern Ireland, these difficulties might have to be faced, but we gather fromthe second draft of the proposed communication that the United States Govern-ment do not at present take this view. We would suggest, therefore, that itwould be wiser for the United States Government to postpone for the presentthe approach to Mr. de Valera which they have had in mind.I may add that the Prime Minister spoke to the President about this matter on the. 7th December, and outlined to him the views which I have expressed inthe preceding paragraphs.   I understand that the President, while feeling that&apos;it would have been a good thing to have an American protest to Ireland on record,said that he quite understood our line of thought.Since writing the above, you have been good enough to draw my attention&apos;to a message from the. Department of State dated the 13th November. LordCranborne and I have carefully considered this message, but it does not, in ourview, affect the main arguments set out in this letter as to the embarrassmentwhich such an approach by the United States Government at the present juncturewould be likely to cause both to them and to us.(Signed) ANTHONY&apos; EDEN.&apos;The Honourable John G. Winant.
