THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PBOPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1943.SECRET,W.P. (43) 559.   (Revise.)17th December, 1943.WAR CABINET.ANGLO-AMERICAN DISCUSSIONS UNDER ARTICLE VII.Memorandum by Minister of State.I attach reports by the various groups which met recently at Washingtonfor exploratory and informal discussions with the. appropriate United states officials on a number of matters arising under Article VII of the Mutual aid agreement.2. Doubtless before my colleagues proceed to consider the important issues which are raised by these reports, they will wish the material to be sifted in an orderly manner by the interested Departments acting in consultation. I proposethat there should be set up an official Committee charged with the duty of doing this, and I suggest that in order to maintain continuity I myself should takethe chair at its meetings.3. My colleagues will recall that before engaging in these talks atWashington, informal discussions were held with officials from the Dominions.The Dominion Governments will naturally now expect to hear from us in some detail what passed at Washington indeed, I feel that we are under a definiteobligation in this matter. This obligation, I think, can most satisfactorily be discharged by means of a further Conference in London at which the various issues involved can be thoroughly examined by experts. As time is needed toprepare and assemble such a Conference, I ask that authority should be givenforthwith for the issue of the appropriate invitations to the Dominion Govern-ments. There is, moreover, another factor calling for speed in handling thismatter : the State Department have intimated to us that they hope to be readyto resume the talks, still, of course, on an exploratory basis, a,s early as the1st February, 1944; there is, therefore, no time to lose if we are to put throughthe necessary exchange of views with the Dominions and to be ready at the dateaimed at by the Americans for the next stage of our informal talks with them.R.

MONETARY POLICY.(i) Covering Report.THREE documents have emerged from the currency talks at the UnitedStates Treasury which finished on Saturday the 9th October.The first is a letter which I handed to Dr. White on the 11th Octoberrecording my understanding of the subsequent procedure as it had been discussed at the meeting of the two groups on the 9th October.The second is a Draft Statement of Principles, prepared as a Directive tothe Drafting Committee, which it is hoped to set up as a preliminary stage of amonetary conference a&apos;t which ail the United and Associated Nations will berepresented. Certain passages of this document include alternative United Statesand United Kingdom provisions, where we agreed to differ for the time being,pending further consideration in London. The points of difference mainly ariseout of matters where the British group were not in a position to go furthertowards agreement consistently with the Cabinet Directive. The more important of them relate to the technical form of the Fund, and to the part to be played bygold. It will be seen, that the American and British groups have been able toarrive at substantial agreement over a very considerable part of the field. I alsoattach a covering letter addressed to Dr. White.The third document is a short paper of agreed Minutes covering points whereagreement was reached but which were too detailed to be embodied in the draft statement of Principles, and also a summary of the points of outstandingdifference as exhibited in the main paper.At the conclusion of the meeting on the 9th October Dr. White proposed thatwe should exchange agreed versions of the first two papers initialled by him and by me, and should exchange correspondence on procedure. I have sent himinitialled copies of the first two papers as being a faithful record of the stageat which our conversations stood on the 9th October, and I have also sent him the above letter on procedure. The letter he read in my presence and did not dissent from its accuracy as a record of what had*passed on the 9th October. Noris there any doubt that the first two papers, which have been prepared with the help of the Secretaries on both sides, are a faithful record. Nevertheless, owingto his early departure from Washington, Dr. White has informed me that heprefers not to initial the record or confirm the letter until a later date when hehas been able to study them at more leisure.I also add, as a matter of interest, a version of the Statement of Principlestranslated into terms of a monetised unitas, which would bring it into conformitywith our Cabinet Directive.To complete the record, I should add that Dr. White informed me on the11th.October that the Congressional Committees have just decided to appoint a small confidential joint committee of both Houses to keep in close touch withthe United States Treasury, both on the currency proposals and the Reconstruc-tion Bank. This committee will either consist of four members, being oneAdministration member and one Opposition member from each House; or,alternatively, six members consisting of the Chairman of the three committees in each House which are interested. Dr. White thinks that he may find it-necessary to bring them into touch with what happened in the recent conversa-modifications, but he assures me that any proceedings in this committee will be strictly confidential and are quite free from any risk of leakage, pr. White expressedthe opinion that the appointment of this committee, though^ somewhat alarmingin appearance, might prove exceedingly helpful. The members of the congress on the committee would be individuals of great authority and influence, and if by association with the conversations at an early stage they could be persuaded to.give them at any rate some measure of their blessing, opposition in congress would be greatly diminished. If, on the other hand, there were particularfeatures of the plan which in the judgment of these experienced legislators wouldbe likely to provoke opposition, we should be warned in good time and would[26480], .        .&apos;.   &apos; b
be in a position to consider whether any modifications could be made to meetthe case.It is quite clearly understood between us that these conversations have been at the technical level and do not bind Ministers on either side. It is now for each group to communicate these papers to higher authority and take instructions asto what is acceptable and what is unacceptable.(Signed) KEYNES.(ii) Correspondence addressed by Lord Keynes to Dr. White.Dear White, 11th October, 1943.With reference to the explanatory conversations between American andBritish officials which have just been concluded on the subject of an internationalstabilisation and clearing scheme, I write to set out my understanding as to the documents which have been agreed between us and as to future procedure.The two documents which you and I have initialled to-day* are, respectively,a Draft Statement of Principles and a Minute of more detailed points agreed and of points reserved for further consideration. The Draft Statement outlinescertain principles which we both are prepared, as technical experts, to recommend to our respective Governments, subject to agreement being reached on outstanding-points at issue. It is understood between us that, although for the purpose ofour discussions the principles are set out and illustrated in terms of a fund whichholds members&apos; currencies, the British representatives are in no way committed to recommending such a form. The Minute is to be read in conjunction with theDraft Statement as amplifying certain points of agreement and defining certain points of disagreement.It is intended that when agreement has been reached on the outstanding points of difference, and when our two Governments have agreed that the draft statement, may properly be made the basis of further discussion, it shall becommunicated in strict confidence to certain of the more important Governmentsof the United Nations. Unless there is sufficient agreement with the proposalsamong these nations, neither side will feel bound to carry it further. If, however,all goes well, the Statement will be communicated to all the United and AssociatedNations, and shortly afterwards made public. But it is clearly understood by both sides that, unless and until this stage has been reached, no publication willtake place. When and if publication is made, it will be simultaneous in washington and London.Procedure in Congress and&apos; in Parliament must, of course, be for ministers to settle. On our part,- if the Chancellor so decides, the Draft Statement of principles may be the subject of a debate in Parliament shortly after publica-tion; but final approval of the scheme will not be sought from Congress orParliament until the Drafting Committee has reported to a Plenary Conferenceand this Conference has recommended the Plan for general adoption. There willbe no further publication of any details prior to this. The Drafting committee itself will be merely a preliminary stage in preparation for the Conference, andits recommendations to the Conference will not be made public.- Assuming that no serious obstacle to progress emerges from the preliminarydebates, a Drafting Committee of (say) a dozen members representing a fairly-wide range of Governments of the United Nations will be called together, we hope in London, at the earliest practicable date. The countries represented onthe Committee might be United States, United Kingdom, U.S.S.R., China,Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Australia, France, Holland, Belgium and Greece.These arrangements may be altered by agreement between us. I also reaffirmin conclusion that neither of our Governments are yet committed by anything thathas passed between us in the recent discussions, all the conclusions of which arestrictly ad referendum.I should be graceful if you would confirm your concurrence in my under-standing as expressed here.Yours sincerely,(Signed) KEYNES.Dr. Harry White,Treasury Department,Washington, D.C.&apos;       * No documents were initialled by Dr. White.
HQ0 0(iii) Anglo-American Draft Statement of Principles.Joint Statement by Experts of United and Associated Nations on the u.k.Establishment of an International Stabilisation Fund. Reservation.[The following draft is intended to set out and illustrate certain principles. It is expressed in terms of a Fund which holds members&apos; currencies. This formof expression has been used to meet the convenience of the United states treasury and in no way commits the British representatives to recommendacceptance of such a form.]Sufficient discussion of the problems of international monetary co-operationhas taken place at the technical level to justify a statement of principles.Governments will not be asked to give final approval to the principles until theyhave been embodied in the form of definitive proposals by the delegates of theUnited and Associated Nations meeting in a formal conference.1. Preamble. .The International Stabilisation Fund is designed as a permanent institutionfor international monetary co-operation. The Fund is intended to facilitate thebalanced growth of international trade and to contribute in this way to themaintenance of a high level of employment. The Fund is expected to providethe machinery for consultation on international monetary problems. Theresources of the Fund are to be available under adequate safeguards to helpmember countries to maintain currency stability while giving them time to correctmaladjustments in their balance of payments without resorting to extrememeasures destructive to international prosperity.2. Purposes of the Fund.(i) To promote exchange stability, to maintain orderly exchange arrange-ments among member countries and to avoid competitive exchange depreciation.(ii) To assure multilateral payments facilities on current transactions among .member countries and to eliminate restrictions inconsistent with this objective.(iii) To shorten the periods and lessen the degree of disequilibrium in theinternational balance of payments of member countries.(iv) To give confidence to member countries by the provision of actual and potential support.[26480] b 2Dear White, 12th October, 1943.In accordance with my undertaking last Saturday, I now enclose an initialledcopy of the Draft Directive and of the Minutes as they emerged from our finalconversation on Saturday. I shall hope for your confirmation, as well as anacknowledgement of my letter of the 11th October concerning procedure, in due course.These two papers are, I think, a faithful record of the stage at which our discussions had then arrived subject to two additions which we understood/&quot;Dr. Bernstein wished to see included. The first of these is Clause 5 (ii) (a). Wedo not necessarily object to the addition of this clause, though this may not bethe right place for it, but it was not actually discussed at our meeting. The other-addition is 10 (i). This definitely carries out an addition on which we decided in principle, but the actual wording was not before the meeting. The new clauseis agreeable to us, and I understand that Dr. Bernstein believes it will be agreeable to you.It faithful record that we shall present these papers to the Chancellorof the Exchequer and other Ministers interested in London. As I made clear in another letter, this does not mean that either party is not free to propose changes,either in substance or in drafting and arrangement.Sincerely yours,(Signed) KEYNES.Dr. Harry White, Treasury Department,Washington, D.C.

In particular, the Fund shall not reject, on the ground of domestic social or political policies which may have led to theapplication, a requested change which is required in the de factosituation to restore equilibrium.&apos; (vi) After consulting the Fund, a. member country may change the estab- statementlished rate for its currency, provided the proposed change, inclusive of any previous changes, does not exceed 10 per cent, since theestablishment of the Fund. In the case of application for a furtherchange not covered by the above and not exceeding 10 per cent., the.Fund shall give its decision within two days of receiving the applica-tion, if the applicant so desires.(vi) After consulting the Fund, a member country may change the estab- g^Kt&quot; m ntlished rate for its currency, provided the proposed change, inclusive a emen &apos;of any previous changes, does not exceed 10 per cent, within successiveten-year periods since the establishment of the Fund. In the case of application for a further change not covered by the above and notexceeding 10 per cent., the Fund shall give its decision within two days of receiving the application, if the applicant so desires.(vii) Because of the extreme uncertainties of the immediate post-war period and recognising that rates established during such period will of necessity be tentative in many instances, during the first three years the Fund&quot; shall recognise that there will be need for many changes andand adjustments and shall resolve cases of reasonable doubt in favourof the country, requesting changes in rates.(viii) Provision shall be made for an agreed uniform change in the gold valueof currencies with the approval of the Fund and of all member countries with 10 per cent, or more of aggregate quotas.8. Repurchase Provisions.(i) A member country may repurchase from the Fund for gold any part of  the latter&apos;s holding of its currency.(ii) If at the end of stated periods, a member&apos;s official holdings of gold and u s-free  foreign  exchange  have  increased,   and  those  holdings  are statement. adequate, the Fund may require that half of the increase be used torepurchase any of the Fund&apos;s holdings of its currency in excess of itsquota.(ii) If at the end of the Fund&apos;s financial year a member&apos;s holding of gold u.k.and of gold-convertible currencies has increased, the rules of the Fund statement-may require that it shall employ the whole or part of this increase torepurchase from the Fund any excess of the Fund&apos;s holding of its currency above its quota.
u.s.Statement.u.k.Statement.9. Capital Transactions.(i) A member country may not use the FuncTs resources to meet a large orsustained outflow of capital,(ii) The Fund may require a member country purchasing foreign exchange,from the Fund to control large or sustained outward movements ofcapital.(iii) These provisions are not intended to interfere with transactions which do not involve a substantial requirement of foreign exchange, or trans-actions required in trade, banking and other business.(iv) Notwithstanding the above provisions, with the approval of the Fund, amember country may purchase foreign exchange to facilitate a transferof capital.(v) A member country may not use its control of capital movements to restrict payments for current transactions (except as provided in 10and 13 (iv)) or to delay unduly the transfer of funds in settlement of commitments.A member country may be asked by the Fund to exercise such control as is required to prevent large and sustained capital move-ments from being financed by recourse to the Fund. This provision isnot intended to prevent the use of the Fund for capital transactions of reasonable amount approved by the member Country&apos;s control as being required in the ordinary course of trade, banking and other business,or for the expansion of exports. Nor is it intended to prevent capital movements of other kinds which are met out of a member country&apos;s&apos; own resources of gold and foreign exchange.10. Apportionment of Scarce Currencies.(i) When it becomes evident to the Fund that the anticipated demand for a currency may soon exhaust the Fund&apos;s holdings of that currency, theFund shall inform the member countries and propose an equitablemethod of apportioning the scarce currency. When a currency is thusdeclared scarce the Fund shall issue a report embodying the causes ofthe scarcity and containing recommendations designed to bring it toan end.(ii) A decision by the Fund to apportion a scarce currency shall operate asan authorisation to member countries after consultation with theFund temporarily to restrict the freedom of exchange operations inthe affected currency, and in determining the manner of restricting the demand.and rationing the limited supply among its nationals the member country shall have complete jurisdiction.11. Management.-   (i) The Fund shall be managed by a Board and Executive Committee repre-senting the members,(ii) The distribution of basic voting power shall be closely related to quotas,but no members shall be entitled to cast more th*an one-fifth of theaggregate votes.(iii) All matters shall be settled by majority, except that a change in thebasis for determining quotas shall require a four-fifths vote, and no member&apos;s quota shall be changed without its assent.12. Withdrawal.(i) A member country may withdraw from the Fund by giving notice inwriting.(ii) Thereafter, the Fund may not sell the currency of that country if theFund&apos;s holdings are less than the unliquidated portion of its quota,nor buy the currency of that country if the Fund&apos;s holdings are morethan the unliquidated portion of its quota. After a country has given notice of withdrawal, its right to utilise the resources of theFund is subject to the approval of the Fund,(iii) The reciprocal obligations of the Fund and the country are to be liquidated within a reasonable time.13. Obligations of Member Countries.(i) Not to buy gold at a price above the parity of its currency, nor to sellgold at a price below the parity of its currency.
(ii) Not to allow exchange transactions between its currency and the curren-cies of other members at rates outside a prescribed range based on the agreed cross parities.(iii) To abandon as soon as possible, when the member country decides that conditions permit, all restrictions on payments for current inter-national transactions with other member countries (other than thoseinvolving capital transfers), and not to impose any additional restric-tions (except upon capital transfers, or in accordance with 10 above)without the approval of the Fund. The Fund may make representations that conditions are favourable to the abandonment of restrictions. ,(iv) Not to engage in discriminatory currency arrangements or multiple cur-rency practices without the approval of the Fund.14. The Inauguration of the Fund.Provisions shall be prepared to cover the transitional period and the definitiveestablishment of the Fund:(iv) Joint Minutes of Anglo-American Meeting.Joint Minutes of the Meeting of United States and United KingdomExperts, United States Treasury, 9th October, 1943.At the final meeting of the experts of the United States and the UnitedKingdom, - held in Washington on the 9th October, 1943, it was agreed that thefollowing details not included in the directive to the drafting committee arealso covered by the discussions on the same basis as the directive itself : 3 (i). The agreed formula is to give the United States a quota not to exceed $3 billion and the United Kingdom a quota of about $1-3.The formula will also provide for setting aside a special allotment of 10 percent, of the aggregate quotas to be used, for the equitable adjustment of quotas.3 (i). &quot; Local funds &quot; are to be a deposit account at the member country&apos;sCentral Bank. In order to avoid an unnecessarily large working balance, theFund would hold local funds in excess^of a working balance in the form of non-negotiable, non-interest bearing Government bills, payable at par on demand by crediting the Fund&apos;s deposit account at the Central Bank.5 (iii). When the provision of additional exchange to a member country is subject to special conditions, the Fund may as one of the conditions require the deposit of suitable collateral.7. The unit of account shall be a given weight of gold. No change in the far value of the currency of member countries shall be permitted to alter thegold value of the assets of the Fund, except that in.the case of a change under7 (viii)this provision may be waived by agreement.The initial rates of exchange of member countries&apos; currencies shall be basedon the official dollar quotations of the 1st July, 1943. If this rate is inappropriatein the judgment of either the Fund or the member country, the initial par valueof a member&apos;s currency shall be agreed between the member country and the Fund.11. When the provision of exchange requires approval of the Fund, basicvotes on such proposals shall be adjusted, notwithstanding 11 (ii), by increasingthe vote of creditor countries and decreasing the vote of debtor countries in theFund. On the suspension or restoration of membership each country shall have one vote.13 (ii). Member countries shall not engage in exchange dealings in non-member countries or in non-member currencies that will undermine stability ofexchange rates established by the Fund.There is a difference of view on the following questions : 3 (ii). Whether the obligatory gold subscription should be of 25 per cent,of the quota or 10 per cent, of the gold holdings of a country, whichever issmaller; and whether the gold contributed to the Fund shall be held by the Fundas a reserve security.5 (ii). Whether a currency should only be acceptable if -it is tenderedagainst another currency which that member can represent to be needed for payments due or shortly falling due.5 (ii). Whether the qualitative controls should apply only after the Fund&apos;sholdings of local currency have reached a specified level^ or whether such controlmay be applied at any time with notice of six months to a year.
6 (ii). Whether a member having holdings of gold and free foreign exchangein excess of its quota should be required to make payment as to 50 per cent, ingold and foreign exchange for currency made available by the Fund.7 (vi). Whether the right to change the established exchange rate of amember currency by a total of 10 per cent, should be renewed for each successivedecade or not.8 (ii). Whether the provision for the repurchase of local currency held bythe Fund shall apply to part of the increase in the free foreign exchange holdings of a member country, or only to holdings of gold convertible currencies.9. Whether the Fund may require a member country not to permit an outward movement of capital which is large and sustained (regardless of the source of the funds used to meet the flow) where a member country is significantlyusing the sources of the Fund.In general whether the Fund, while established on the same fundamental principles as those set out in the Draft Directive, should not be set up and operated in terms of an international currency (monetised unitas).(v) The Draft Statement of Principles in Terms of a Monetised Unitas.In order to express the substance of the Draft Statement of Principles interms of monetised unitas, the following paragraphs should be substituted for those carrying the same number in the Draft discussed with the. Americangroup :  A. Operations of the Fund.(i) Members will receive a credit in the books of the Fund in terms ofunitas equal to their subscription, which, subject to certain qualifica-tions below, they will be free to transfer to the accounts of othermembers with the Fund.(ii) A member whose currency is &quot; acceptable&quot; shall undertake to buy its currency from another member in exchange for a transfer of unitas onthe books of the Fund; and a.member whose currency is &quot; available&quot;shall undertake to sell its currency to another member in exchange fora transfer of unitas on the books of &quot;the Fund.(iii) A member whose holding of unitas exceeds its quota shall be entitledto apply the excess to redeeming its original subscription, first thelocal funds and then the gold. A member which has redeemed all or part of its original subscription for unitas shall be entitled to reverse its action at any time.5. Availability and Acceptability of Members&apos; Currencies.(i) A member&apos;s currency is &quot;available if its balance of unitas in excess ofits outstanding subscription does not exceed its quota, and unless theFund has given notice that the facilities for the purchase of currencyby a transfer of unitas have become scarce, in which case theprovisions of 10 below come into force.(ii) A member&apos;s currency is acceptable :(a) If the member has a balance of unitas with the Fund on which it is entitled to draw.(iii) A member is entitled to draw on its balance of unitas with the Fundunless it has reduced its holding of unitas-by more than 25 per cent,of its quota during the previous twelve months; and if the Fundhas not previously given notice of six months to a year which hasexpired, that a member country is making use of the Fund&apos;s resources in a manner that clearly has the effect of preventing or undulydelaying the establishment of a sound balance in its internationalaccounts. The Fund will not give notice unless the member&apos;s holdings. of unitas have fallen below 33 per cent, of its quota.(iv) The Fund may, in its discretion, make a further balance of unitasavailable to a member country that does not comply with the abovetests, or in addition to its original subscription, on conditions thatsafeguard the interests of the Fund.
6. Multilateral Clearing.[(i), (ii) and (iv) are no longer necessary.](iii) The Fund may buy gold from a member at its par value in exchange fora balance of unitas, the gold so acquired being free gold. A memberdesiring to sell gold is expected to offer it to the Fund, directly.or through another member, if this will serve its purpose in selling thegold equally well. The Fund may, at its option and with the approvalof the member concerned, employ free gold, to redeem any portion ofa member&apos;s balance of unitas in excess of its outstanding subscription.7. Par Value of Member Currencies.(i) The value of unitas shall be expressed in terms of gold.

COMMERCIAL POLICY.Covering Report.1. The course of events has fully justified the decision to take the initiativewith the United States on commercial policy. Indeed had the decision beenotherwise or had the circumstances attending the recent renewal of.the ReciprocalTrade Agreements Act led to a change of mind many disadvantageous develop-ments might have occurred. We found that the Americans had embarked in theirpowerful interdepartmental committee, known as the Trade Agreements Com-mittee, on the preparation of a report to their Ministers on post-war commercial policy. They suspended this work immediately our visit was arranged so that theresults of our discussions with them might be embodied in that report. Thus wecaught them at the formative stage of their thinking before their ideas hadcrystallised.2. Even so it might have been found that the well-known American predis-position to bilateral negotiations rendered them unreceptive to the multilateralapproach which we were instructed to advocate. The contrary proved to be thecase. They were already impressed with the desirability of finding a practicablemultilateral method of dealing with a problem which would require rapid and comprehensive treatment; they admitted that our thinking along these lines had gone further and had produced more finished results than they had yet reached;and they at once adopted as the agenda for discussions the Outline which, togetherwith the Introductory Note (viz. the Aide-Menfoire approved by the War Cabinet),we handed to them almost immediately after our arrival. These documents are attached as Annexes B and C.3. The group of American officials with which we worked included men of real authority in their respective spheres. In the words of Mr. H. C. Hawkins ofthe State Department, who presided over our discussions with great ability andfairness, it included the half dozen or so officials in the United States servicewhose influence really counts in commercial policy. The views advanced fromthe United. Kingdom side were put forward on an informal, exploratory and non-committal basis; this was even more true in the case of those put forward bythe Americans. It was clear that they had less Ministerial guidance than our-selves, and they were careful to remind us of this fact. No doubt AmericanMinisters were kept generally informed of the course of the discussions, and thereis significance in the fact that Mr. Hull should have permitted the conversationsto be concentrated as they were upon the search for a multilateral solution. It is significant, too, that at no time during our actual discussions did the Americansrefer to the resumption of the series of bilateral negotiations which have been proceeding slowly between the United States and Australia, New Zealand andSouth Africa respectively and have been for some time in suspense. We hadfeared, with some reason, that we should be subjected to inconvenient pressure to continue these negotiations, involving concessions from the United kingdom on a bilateral basis. But pressure put upon us by the Australian representatives in Washington and the approach which they made to the State Department ledto no visible results until we were taking leave of Mr. Hawkins an hour before our departure from Washington. He then mentioned the approach made by the australians and asked whether we had any views about it. He was told that we felt no enthusiasm for a series of bilateral discussions, and that in our view theywould take the edge off the more comprehensive attack on the problem which we regarded as essential. Mr. Hawkins said that he sympathised with this view and that in any case no decision could be reached until all these matters had beensubmitted to Mr. Hull on his return from Moscow.4. These elements in the situation were undoubtedly favourable. It would,however, be dangerous to read too much into them. In the course of variousinformal conversations it became clear that Mr. Hull at least will be difficult to persuade of the possibility of a multilateral solution to the commercial policyproblem. We were reminded of the cautious line which it is his nature to take on a problem of this character. In Committee little reference was made to theserious political difficulties and possible constitutional pitfalls which lie ahead,but we were carefully warned that the silence of American officials on this subjectmust not lead us to underestimate their importance. The attitude which Con-grcwa may take on this and similar questions and the uncertain political
atmosphere which the approach of the presidential election brings with it are certainly very present in the minds of the American officials with whom we talked.They may well prove decisive in the minds of American Ministers and of Mr. Hullin particular. On the other hand, the9American officials are well impressed withthe fact that the need for wise and active leadership by the United Kingdom andthe United States in the field of commercial policy may present itself with great urgency if the war situation continues to develop favourably in Europe, and thatthe inaction which the Americans might prefer for their own political reasonsbetween now and November, 1944, may well have to give place to positive decisions,notwithstanding the difficulties.5. We have made considerable progress.by enlisting the interest of UnitedStates officials in discussing seriously with us the advantages and possibilities ofa multilateral solution. But we must not imagine that this group of Americanofficials is yet convinced that the multilateral solution would be practicable. all of them are convinced that it is desirable if it proves practicable. This isparticularly true of the officials from the State Department, Mr. Hawkins,Mr. Hickerson and Mr. Fuqua. These, like the others, were very conscious of theserious difficulties in the way of a multilateral solution, but they were not in theleast defeatist in their outlook. Mr. Wheeler of the Department of Agriculturewas at first among the sceptics, but in the course of the discussion became visiblymore convinced of the desirability and even of the possibility of the multilateralapproach. Throughout our meetings he showed a great desire to co-operate in finding a solution, but any comprehensive clearance of trade barriers presentsserious problems for his Department. In particular, as is explained at some length below, our proposal for the limitation of export subsidies raises difficulties for American agricultural policy. Mr. Paul Appleby of the Department ofAgriculture was not present at our discussions, but we became aware of the factthat at a late stage he made an intervention from outside our Committee, stressingthese difficulties. Mr. Ryder, Chairman of the Tariff Commission, started andremained the most obstinate sceptic. In spite of the utmost persuasion both fromthe American State Department officials and from ourselves he still maintainedthe view that the multilateral formulas for tariff reduction which we discussedwere probably either impracticable or inequitable, though even he admitted thatthe multilateral method was desirable.6. We should not feel called upon to set down at such length thesecautionary comments if the progress made and the prospects of further progresswere not in our view so surprisingly great. The spirit of the discussions was inthe main that of a joint attack upon a common problem. Inevitably there wereareas particularly sensitive in the respective policies of the United. States andthe United Kingdom in which a divergence of immediate interest led to a toughtussle, but even at the most exhausting moments tempers were under complete control; and though frankness, and indeed blantness, were never lacking when required, feelings of personal respect, mutual confidence, and indeed real friend-ship, were never disturbed.7. We were anxious from the outset that as a result of our discusions thereshould be some joint Anglo-American document recording the progress made and indicating the points both of agreement and of disagreement. We were thereforepleased to find that the Americans agreed that such a joint report was desirable,and indeed that they were willing to go as far as to produce with us a detailedjoint document covering the whole field of Commercial Policy. It forms Annex Ato this report. This joint document will now go forward from their side to american Ministers. Looking back at the expectation with which we started onthis work in Washington, it is satisfactory that a document which is so closely(in many cases identically) similar to our own Outline is now jointly submittedto Ministers on both sides.8. This joint report is based throughout on&apos; the assumption that a multilateral commercial convention is desirable, that such a convention shouldlimit all forms of protection and discrimination in commerce very much on thelines which we had suggested, that it should make provision for an international commercial institution similar to that which we had put forward, and that itshould have a scope and a set of rules for membership of the kind which we hadadvocated. But we must not conceal from ourselves that among the limited number of points on which the views of the two sides could not at present be reconciled there are some of far-reaching importance. These will be discussed in greater detail below. We must remember also that this joint attempt to find a multilateral solution will be going forward in the United States to a cautious andconservative Secretary of State, who has&apos;described the renewal of the Reciprocal
Trade Agreements Act as a major contribution to the economic well-being of thepost-war world.9. On a number of detailed points of commercial policy we have reachedfull agreement with the American officials in our joint document. On some ofthese we have done useful constructive thinking together, as a result of whichideas on both sides have been developed. There were, however, as was to beexpected, a number of points on which there was some difference of emphasis, andone or two points on which major differences of opinion Avere revealed. Differencesmay be noted &quot;on the following less important points :-(a) Infant Industries and Industries necessary on grounds of security-the americans argued that exceptions to the rules limiting the use of tariffs and of quantitative import restrictions should not be permitted in these cases. Theyargued that subsidisation was the appropriate instrument and was liable to lessabuse than other methods. We were impressed by their arguments, but urged thatattention must be given to undeveloped countries such as India and China, whichdesire to protect certain industries on these grounds and which cannot easily raisethe funds necessary for subsidisation. We are, therefore, less certain than the americans whether their more rigid attitude can be sustained without makingimpossible the adherence of such countries to the proposed convention.(b) Methods of dealing with tmfair presstire on the part of State-tradingcountries. The Americans are faced with constitutional and political difficultiesin any suggestion that Government monopolies should be set up in private-enterprise countries to canalise their trade with State-trading countries. For thisreason, and as a result of the great emphasis which they place on the principleof non-discrimination, they oppose the institution of such counter-monopolies notonly by themselves but by other private-enterprise countries. The Americans arenervous lest the institution of counter-monopolies for this purpose might lead toa widespread extension of State trading. As any proposal encouraging theformation of counter-monopolies would certainly be opposed both by the russians and the Americans and would, from our own point of view, have uncertainadvantages, we are inclined to think that the proposed multilateral convention should contain no provision for their institution.(c) The Transitional Period-The Americans took what to us appeared anunrealistic view about the nature and length of the transitional period after the close of hostilities. At the outset they wished to restrict the transitional period,during which there would be special exceptions to the rules limiting the use of import restrictions, to one year subject to extension by an appropriate international body. Even during this very limited period they wished to hedgethe special use of quantitative restrictions too closely. We left them in no doubtthat the conditions in countries whose economies had been dislocated or wreckedon a scale much greater than anything experienced on the American continentwould have to be taken much more carefully into account. The agreed documentreflects a considerable advance in their thinking on this subject. It may well be capable of further improvement as a result of more intensive study of probablepost-war conditions.(d) Extension of benefits to non-members. The Americans rathersurprisingly argued strongly in favour of the view that the benefits of any multi-lateral convention should not be extended to countries which refused to adhere toit. It will be remembered that, during the discussions with the Dominions inJune 1943, the Canadians adopted a similar attitude. We are inclined to agreewith them that at least the tariff reductions resulting from a multilateralconvention should not be extended to non-members, and that the leading trading-nations must exercise this form of pressure if the necessary degree of adherenceis to be secured.10.   We come now to those points on which really serious potential difficultiesbecome apparent: (a) Limitation of Subsidies. Our proposals for the abolition of export subsidies would require the abolition of &quot;two-price&quot; systems whereby exports,are sold at lower prices than those corresponding to domestic prices. A departure:from the two-price system would involve a radical reversal of policy in animportant part of the assistance given to American agriculture. We were greatly impressed, as were the members of the State Department, at the readiness ofMr. Wheeler, of the Department of Agriculture, seriously to consider thepossibility of getting away from the two-price system. We have already referredto the belated rumblings on this point which emerged from Mr. Appleby.[26480] u
Mr. Wheeler, on the other hand, showed that he would not be at all sorry to seizean opportunity of. turning to other less objectionable schemes for agriculturalsubsidisation which did not involve the two-price system. But it is necessary to recall that a decision of the Supreme Court has made it difficult, if not impossible,to have recourse to the method of a processing tax, which Mr. Wheeler himselffavours. If the two-price system were retained in American agriculture it wouldinvolve also the use of quantitative import restrictions in order to prevent a floodof imports into the domestic market when domestic prices were held at a levelhigher than world prices. Such an exception to a general rule prohibiting the useof quantitative restrictions for protective purposes would be abhorrent to theState Department and would be inconsistent-with the ideas put forward by us inour Introductory Note and Outline. It would give an opportunity for the useof quantitative import restriction for the thinly disguised purpose of givingunlimited protection and would thus threaten the interests of our export trade.The Americans were, however, willing to contemplate the prohibition of export subsidies and thus of the two-price system only if some limit were set tothe subsidisation of production in importing countries of those products whichwere in world surplus. We argued stoutly against this. In our view some generalsafety valve must be allowed if we were successfully to limit the use of the mostrigid forms of protection. To us it appeared that direct subsidisation ofproduction was the least objectionable method. In particular, we argued that the limitations proposed for the use of tariffs, of quantitative import restriction andof State trading would severely restrict the means by which agriculture could be protected in the United Kingdom. It was essential, therefore, that the subsidisa-tion of agricultural production should be permitted.There should, however, be no misunderstanding that at the present stage reached in our exploratory discussions this difference of view remains unreconciledand that in the American view it will not be possible to secure the abolition of export subsidies unless there is a limitation of subsidies paid in importing countries on production of commodities of which there are world surpluses. Thisis not the place to discuss the dilemma in detail, but a solution may perhaps bepossible on the following lines : In the case of a commodity declared to be in worldsurplus, an atttempt might be made internationally to reach agreement on thelimitation of subsidies to that commodity in all producing countries. If such agreement were not reached, the rule prohibiting export subsidies might then beallowed to lapse in the case of that particular commodity so long as it continuedto be in surplus supply.   (The relevant section of Annex A is V).(b) The bilateral treatment of tariffs. The American officials agreed on thedesirability of including in the proposed commercial convention a multilateral,formula for the reduction of tariffs if a practicable and equitable formulacould be found, but there was sharp disagreement between us upon what might happen if such a multilateral formula were not discoverable. the americans suggested that in this case the multilateral convention might include merely an undertaking on the part of the countries concerned to negotiate subsequent bilateral agreements for the reduction of tariffs.We made it perfectly clear that, in our view, such an arrangement would be outof the question, even though, as the Americans were forced to admit, preferenceswould in this case be dealt with by a similar bilateral procedure. We and other european countries would certainly not be able to commit ourselves to give up theuse of quantitative import restrictions and to undertake precise obligationslimiting the use of other protective devices in return for what would necessarily be problematical future advantages from uncertain tariff reductions. the separate view which we recorded will be found in the joint document (Annex A :See Section I, Tariffs, paragraph 1, Multilateral Tariff Action).It follows that, notwithstanding the difficulties, the search for a multilateraltariff reduction formula and several alternatives deserving careful examination in detail are put forward in the joint document must be pressed with energy and. determination. We have reason to believe that the State Departmentmembers taking part in the discussions were by no means displeased at thefirmness with which we maintained our attitude on this point and that it mayin fact help them to overcome the scepticism of Mr. Ryder and others at whoseinstance this unsatisfactory proposal for combining bilateral tariff negotiationswith the multilateral treatment of other forms of protection was probablyinserted.(c) Preferences. At an early stage of our discussion on preferences it became apparent that the Americans intended to test our sincerity on the fulfil-ment of the obligations which we accepted when Article VII of the Mutual Aid
Agreement was signed. They pressed, us with great persistence and spared noemphasis in telling us that their difficulties in securing the tariff reductionsprescribed in the Article would be insuperable if the United Kingdom maintaineda position suggesting that the offer of a substantial cut in preference marginswas all that would be called for from us in any circumstances that could reason-ably be foreseen. They admitted our argument that tariff reductions and the elimination of preferences were relative, but pressed us for a definite statement that there was a degree of tariff reduction in return for which we should abolishpreferences. We could not regard this pressure as illegitimate as an enquiry into the meaning of the final obligation under Article VII. We had among the documents for our guidance a minute by Sir W. Malkin dated the;23rd December, 1941, of which the following are the first two sentences:,&apos;&apos; Imperial preference is certainly a &apos; form of discriminatory treatment&apos; withinthe meaning of the phrase in Article VII; consequently its ultimate&apos; elimination &apos; forms part of the programme indicated in the draft article.&quot; Noamount of emphasis on the language of the Article itself or of the telegram of interpretation received by Mr. Winant from the State Department on the16th December, 1941, as to the progressive nature of the action to be taken inregard to tariffs and preferences could enable us to evade this ultimate issuewithout exciting a most undesirable atmosphere of distrust. It was natural that our opening gambit of offering a 50 per cent, cut in preference in returnfor a 25 per cent, ceiling on tariffs, which we had put forward tentatively inaccordance with our instructions, should give rise to this pertinent question asto our view of the ultimate obligation involved.The time soon came to ensure that these related questions of tariffs andpreferences were placed in a better perspective. We told the Americans that wehad listened to a good deal about the difficulties for them in tariff reduction and that it was at least of equal importance that we should explain to themand that they should understand the difficulties for us in any radical downwardadjustment of preferences. We pointed out with suitable emphasis that theImperial preferential system had its justification in a special political relation-ship and referred to the anomaly of considering Imperial preferences aspeculiarly sinful, when the 100 per cent, preferences which the States of theAmerican Union enjoyed with each other were lauded as one of the principalvirtues. We added to these political considerations economic reasons for theview that tariff preferences were to be. regarded at least as no more obnoxiousthan high tariff barriers themselves. We warned them that to press the argument against Imperial preference as though these considerations were negligible would only result in creating resistances and resentments, which might prevent the realisation of progress in clearing the channels of trade which might otherwise be within reach. &apos;Our arguments appeared to have some effect. At later meetings the Americanattack on preferences was conducted&apos; in a more sober and realistic atmosphere.They admitted that they had no ultimate objection to token preferences which did not have any substantial effect in diverting trade. They admitted that inorder to obtain the virtual abolition of preferences they would have to make adequate reductions in their tariff, and that the difficult problem of determiningwhat degree of tariff reduction would be adequate for this purpose remained forconsideration at a later stage. Nevertheless we gained the definite impression that an offer to halve preferential margins will, in the American view, be adequateonly to obtain a moderate reduction of their tariff; or, to be more precise, thata reduction of the American tariff to a ceiling of 25 per cent, ad valorem or areduction of corresponding severity -would cost us practically the whole of ourpreferential margins. (The relevant Section of Annex A is II--see particularlyparagraph 1.)11. On private occasions outside the meetings of the Committee itself wehad some informal talks with American officials on the subject of future procedure.. There is no tendency at ail among the Americans to regardcommercial policy as a topic which can be successfully treated by vagueresolutions of an aspirational kind. Indeed, Mr. Hawkins said that in no circumstances would he be a party to projecting the subject into international discussion unless a concrete scheme had been prepared. The American officialsfelt sufficiently encouraged with the progress that had been made to express thehope that there would be a resumption of the conversations at some date early next year. It would be idle to speculate upon the view which American Ministers&apos;may take of the political feasibility of anything of the kind which is discussed[26480] D 2     -
in our joint report. But provided that their attitude is not negative we for our part should regard it as highly important that our discussions with Americanofficials should be resumed before any long interval has elapsed. In our view this is important because there are many technical points which still requirejoint examination and because there are a number of differences of opinion which still need to be reconciled.12. To summarise, we should not exaggerate the results which have been achieved by these discussions on Commercial Policy. Some of the Americanofficials still doubt the practicability of a general multilateral convention;American Ministers are completely uncommitted and in some cases are almost certainly still sceptical; many political difficulties lie ahead, since the attitudeof Congress is uncertain and the year of a presidential election is normally no time for boldness. Moreover, in the course of our discussions we encountered anumber of technical difficulties, and one or two major potential clashes of policy have been revealed. Nevertheless, it would be fair to say that as a result of thesetalks the first of several steps towards the achievement of a general multilateralcommercial convention has been successfully taken. American officials are seriously considering its possibilities and are, most of them at least, convinced of its desirability if they can be convinced of its practicability. We believe thatwe have at least engendered in their minds a healthy horror of the chaoticsituation which may develop if this effort should fail.Washington, 21st October, 1943.Annex A.Agreed Anglo-American Document on Commercial Policy.I. &quot;Tariffs.1. Multilateral tariff action.There are set forth below for further study tariff-reduction provisions for possible inclusion in a general multilateral convention on commercial policy.All of these are multilateral tariff-reduction formulas except the last (see E,below), which is a proposal for multilateral provisions embodying an undertaking to negotiate bilateral tariff agreements.It is the view of both the United States and the United Kingdom groups thatif a workable multilateral tariff-reduction formula acceptable to a large numberof nations providing for a drastic reduction of tariffs without nullifying excep-tions and reservations can be found, it,would be superior. It would be superiorbecause it would accomplish tariff reductions more quickly and because it wouldmake it easier to accomplish the elimination of quotas and other non-tariff traderestrictions. The spirit of close international co-operation engendered by the warprovides a favourable atmosphere for multilateral action now; as the end of thewar approaches the atmosphere for such action may be expected to become less favourable; after the war it may be too late for such action.In the view of the United Kingdom group, it will not be possible to obtainadherence to a multilateral convention prohibiting quantitative import restrictions and limiting the use of other protective devices unless it includes a satisfactoryformula for multilateral tariff reduction. It is their view that a precise obligationto limit the use of other protective devices would be impossible without an equallycomprehensive and closely defined obligation covering tariffs, and that this couldbe achieved only if the convention provides for simultaneous mutilateral actionto reduce tariffs. Otherwise countries will be required to abandon the use of quantitative import restrictions and other instruments of protection in condi-tions in which the extent of the tariff benefits to be enjoyed later must inevitably be problematical. Moreover, in their view, the justifiable anxieties which willexist in many countries with serious balance-of payments problems will make itimpossible to proceed sufficiently far and fast by bilateral negotiations under
most-favoured-nation rules, which would involve giving concessions to third parties without the assurance of corresponding counter-concessions.The United States group does not associate itself with the views set forth inthe paragraph above.2. Alternative provision for the implementation of tariff reduction.A. The reduction of all duties by x per cent, of their height at a given time,or to y per cent, ad valorem (or its equivalent in the case of specific duties), which-ever may result in the lower duty, but no duty need be reduced below z per cent.ad valorem (or its equivalent in the case of specific duties).Advantages.One of the principal advantages of formula A appears to be that it would bear more heavily on the higher duties and less heavily on the lower duties.Countries with low tariffs would not be required to make the same total percentagereduction as countries with high tariffs.Disadvantages.Some of the principal disadvantages of formula A seem to be :-(1) It would tend to destroy the tariff structure, i.e., the relationships betweenthe tariffs on different commodities of countries having a large number- of duties in excess of y per cent.; however, such countries might makeproper adjustment through downward revision of the related duties.(2). It would require the establishment of a relatively uniform system of tariff valuation among the various countries (and the conversion ofad valorem duties to the new basis), in order that y per cent, andz per cent, might mean approximately the same thing in all countries.(3) It would require the determination of the ad. valorem, equivalents of specific duties. This would not be so difficult in countries which havea system of tariff valuation, but would present a problem for thecountries which have adopted general systems of specific duties or-systems of arbitrary valuation.B. The uniform reduction of all duties in all countries by a given percentageof their height on a given date.Advantages.Some of the advantages of formula B appear to be its simplicity andease of administration in all countries, its appearance of treating all countriesalike, and the fact that it would to a considerable extent preserve the relationships between the tariffs on different commodities.Disadvantages.The main disadvantage of formula B appears to be that it would reduce lowtariffs to the same relative extent as high tariffs, and therefore would almost certainly be considered as inequitable by low-tariff countries, particularly thosehaving specific duties the protective incidence of which has declined because of increased prices. This disadvantage might be remedied by providing for thereduction of the higher duties by a greater percentage than the lower. However,this would introduce technical difficulties of the kind indicated under A, above.C. The reduction of all duties by a given percentage, except.that no dutyneed be reduced below a specified, ad valorem, rate.Advantages.The advantages of formula C are that: (1) it would permit the applicationto high-tariff and low-tariff countries of a uniform tariff reduction in a mannerequitable to both; and (2) it wTould preserve to a considerable extent the tariffstructures of the various countries.Disadvantages.The main disadvantage of formula C is that, like formula A, it presentstechnical difficulties of tariff valuation and the conversion of specific duties,although on a lesser scale.
D. The uniform reduction by a given percentage of the overall^ valoremequivalent of each country&apos;s entire tariff calculated in comparison with its totalimports. It is assumed that there would be provision preventing any increase induties.A advantages.The chief advantages of -formula D appear to be that it would permit tariffreduction on a highly selective basis, would be free from technical problems of customs enforcement and would interfere to a relatively small degree with thetariff autonomy of the various countries. For these reasons, formula D might bemore attractive to a large number of countries than the other formulas considered.This formula would raise some technical questions, e.g., whether revenue duties should be included, &amp;c.Disadvantages.Some of the major disadvantages of formula D appear to be : (1) Existing methods of tariff measurement involve the use of the volume ofimports as weights, and since protective duties, especially highly pro-tective duties, curtail imports, the moderate duties receive in generalthe greatest Aveight. Therefore, under existing methods of- tariffmeasurement, formula D might cause countries to bring about the required reduction in the overall ad valorem level by reducing the moderate duties, and there would be little or no incentive to reduce the highly protective or prohibitive duties. On the other hand, this formula would give no weight to reductions of superfluous duties onproducts of which there is little or no actual or potential importation.(2) Formula D would not require any greater proportionate tariff cut byhigh-tariff countries than by low-tariff countries.E. The inclusion in the proposed commercial policy convention of a pro-vision whereby each country would agree to negotiate with its principal suppliesbilateral agreements providing for tariff reductions on its major dutiable imports.This would, of course, involve dealing by the same method with preferences here-tofore regarded as exemptions from the most-favoured-nation clause.A advantages.The advantages of proposal E are that it would be technically sound and relatively free from problems of equity as between high-tariff and low-tariffcountries.Disadvantages.Disadvantages of this method of approach as compared with multilateralformulas are indicated under 1 above.3. Revenue Duties.It is assumed that any provisions for the simultaneous reduction of tariffs inall countries would not apply to revenue duties, Avhich could be increased.Revenue duties might include the following;-(a) Duties which compensate for taxes imposed on the like domestic articlesor ingredients thereof.(&amp;) Duties which are imposed on imports of products not produceddomestically, with provision, if possible, for guarding against.the non-reduction or increase of duties which are clearly designed to protectdomestic production of a closely competitive product.(c) Ancillary charges on imports commensurate with the cost of services rendered,4. Infant industries and security industries.There are strong arguments against permiting exceptions for the protectionof national defence or &quot;infant&quot; industries, in view of other methods, less objectionable than tariffs, available for this purpose. But in order to obtain the adherence of countries which are industrially undeveloped and which have difficulty in raising funds for the payment of subsidies, it may be necessary to contemplate some modification of this rule (see III, Quantitative import restrictions, paragraph 1; and V, Subsidies, paragraph 4).
5. Other tariff measures.It is believed that the problem of antidumping and countervailing duties,multi-column tariffs, tariff quotas, and other similar tariff measures, questionsregarding which would arise in connection with any multilateral conventionregarding tariffs, should be explored later, in the light of the particular tariff-reduction proposal selected as most feasible.6. Comments.It is believed that a major obstacle to the application of an equitable multi-lateral tariff-reduction formula is the technical problem of uniform tariff valuation and conversion of duties involved in the application to the tariffs of all countries ofuniform ad valorem &quot; floors &quot; or &quot; ceilings,&quot; and that further investigation of methods to overcome this obstacle might be useful. In this connection, the praticability of the following suggestions might be investigated : (a) The necessity for drastically changing the tariff valuation systems ofmany countries to a single basis, and for the consequent recomputationof the existing ad valorem duties of those countries, might be providedby providing for a different ad valorem &quot; floor &quot; or &quot; ceiling &quot; for thetwo principal valuation systems now used, namely, landed value andforeign value. Thus the ad valorem tariff &quot;floor&quot; for countrieshaving a non-arbitrary valuation system based on landed value mightbe a; per cent., whereas the &quot;floor&quot; for countries having a non-arbitrary valuation system based on foreign value might be x plus yper cent.(b) Countries having some system of non-arbitrary tariff valuation might,with, relatively little difficulty, be able to modify it so as to conform to either a standard landed-value system or a standard foreign valuesystem, which might be described in the multilateral convention. Eachstandard system might be loosely described so as to require merely a rough uniformity -among countries adhering to it.(c) A study might be undertaken of ways in which countries having primarilyspecific rates of duty, or having purely arbitrary valuation systems,might be assisted in establishing a satisfactory system of tariffvaluation.7. Conclusions.Further study would appear to be required before even tentative conclusionscan be reached as to which one of the tariff proposals outlined above would provesuitable for inclusion in the proposed general multilateral convention on commercial policy.II. Preferences.1. Article VII of the Mutual-Aid Agreement between the United Statesand the United Kingdom provides for agreed action looking not only toward thereduction of tariffs but also toward the elimination of all forms of discriminatorytreatment in international commerce. No convention of the kind proposed wouldgive final effect to these obligations unless it makes definite provision both for anadequate reduction of tariffs and for the ultimate substantial abolition of pre-ferences. There remains for determination at the proper time the difficult question of what reduction of tariffs, at one step or by stages, would be adequate to make possible the substantial abolition of preferences. It has become clear inthe course of the discussions that United States opinion would not consider itequitable or reasonable to contemplate drastic and comprehensive reduction of tariffs (assuming this to be feasible) if it were not accompanied by the simultaneoussubstantial abolition of preferences.2. It would seem desirable and necessary to provide in the proposed com-mercial policy convention for the following exceptions from the provisions forequality of tariff treatment (a) Preferences granted in order to facilitate frontier traffic (i.e., within azone not exceeding, say, 15 kilometres on each side of the frontier).(b) Preferences granted as a transitional stage of an approvedcustoms union.Such preferences should be excepted only if the attainment of thefull customs union is scheduled to be achieved within a fixed and reasonable period of years at a predetermined rate of moderation and final elimination of the internal duties.
III. Prohibitions and Quantitative Restrictions on Imports.1. General Aspects.Absolute import prohibitions and import restrictions, such.as quotas andlicensing systems, are among the devices most destructive of international trade.They introduce an element of rigidity into trade relationships which frequentlylends itself to speculative manipulations and erratic price fluctuations. Theyalmost inevitably result in discrimination among suppliers, uneconomic diversion of trade, international friction and ill will.As part of a multilateral convention the use of prohibitions or quantitative restrictions except in certain special cases should be prohibited. Their use forthe purpose of protecting home industries, including infant industries and industries deemed necessary on grounds of national security, would be proscribed(see-1, Tariffs, paragraph 4; and V, Subsidies, paragraph 4). Existing importprohibitions and restrictions would be abolished subject to specified exceptions.These exceptions would be held to a minimum and defined as closely as possiblein order to avoid loopholes through which the purposes of the convention wouldbe impaired.2. Exceptions.(a) Balance-of-payments difficulties. The use of quantitative restrictions to safeguard a country&apos;s balance of payments would be permissible, provided ncpreferable means which would render unnecessary the imposition of quantitative restrictions were found. Any such restrictions would be applied only to theextent and so long as the country&apos;s balance-of-payments position required, andwould be subject to approval by the proposed international commercial policy organisation and to an objective test.  A suggested procedure is as follows : (1) The imposition of quantitative restrictions on imports for balance-of-payments reasons should be based on objective criteria. account should be taken of the balance of payments of the country in question with the rest of the world^ The imposition of appropriate restrictionson imports, on a non-discriminatory basis between countries, shouldbe permitted if its balance on current account, together with inwardlong-term capital transactions, had been seriously adverse over a specified period, or if the country&apos;s holdings of liquid reserves is inadequate. The deficit on balance of current account in the formeralternative might be measured as a percentage of a country&apos;s foreign trade: and the adequacy of the liquid reserves by a similar test orby reference to tests provided under any monetary scheme.3. The provisions of the proposed commercial policy convention lookingtoward the abolition of tariff preferences would not apply to customs unionswhich already exist. However, future customs unions between any two or morecustoms areas should be reviewed by the proposed international commercial policy organisation (see VII, International Commercial Policy Organisation). In sofar as economic criteria are concerned, it is suggested that future customs unionsshould not be favourably viewed&apos; which failed to meet certain specified require-ments, among which might be the following : (a) In general, a union between two or more customs areas should be suchas would promote the economic selection and location of industry andafford in time the benefits of larger-scale and more specialisedproduction.(b) The customs union should be effected by applying to the whole of theproposed new customs territory external rates of duty not in excessof the average of the corresponding rates previously applicable inthe constituent areas.There may be overriding political factors and considerations which mightrender certain proposed customs unions unacceptable even if they meet fully the test of the economic criteria suggested above; on the other hand, such considerations might impel the acceptance of certain customs unions which didnot meet all the desirable economic criteria.
(2) If in the light of these criteria a country concluded that action wasnecessary on its part, it would be entitled unilaterally to impose atemporary stoppage on any increase in its imports above those in themost recent twelve months&apos; period, but should be bound to obtain the subsequent approval of the proposed international commercial policy organisation for its action. Any more drastic action on its part wouldrequire the prior approval of such an organisation. The organisation should base its decision upon the objective criteria mentioned in(1) above.(3) Unless contrary arrangements were approved by the international commercial policy organisation, a country which imposed quantitative restrictions on imports under the foregoing rule would be required tocomplete their removal within twelve months if (on objective criteriacorresponding to those outlined in (1) above) its balance of payments on current account had been sufficiently favourable over a period andits holdings of liquid reserves had been restored to an adequate level.(4) If quantitative restrictions on imports imposed under these rules continue for more than two (or perhaps three) years, the country in questionundertakes to consult with the international commercial policy organisation and with other appropriate international institutions inorder to determine whether some other action (such as an adjustment of exchanges, alterations in the flow of international long-term capital or an expansion of money incomes in other countries) couldnot be appropriately taken.It may be necessary to consider a special supplementary provisionif arrangements are made under the proposed international monetaryinstitution for special measures to deal with scarce currencies.(b) Commodity agreements. The use of quantitative restrictions when necessary to implement a recognised international commodity agreement wouldbe allowed.(c) Other exceptions. The convention would prCvide for necessary andlegitimate exceptions in regard to such matters as sanitary regulations, &amp;c. Ifapplication is given to the principles laid down in the section on subsidies, itwould be unnecessary to have any exception with respect to the imposition of quantitative restrictions in connection with domestic production control measures.3. Temporary Emergency Exceptions.In the emergency period during and immediately following the war importprohibitions and quantitative limitations would be permitted when necessary tomeet emergencies arising from (a) the necessity of rationing imports because ofshortages of supplies, shipping or foreign exchange, and (b) a temporary surplusof stocks of the commodity to which the restriction applies. These temporaryexceptions would be applicable for a specified limited period after the cessation of hostilities unless the period of their application were further extended by action of the proposed international commercial policy organisation.4. Rules of Fair Conduct.The provisions in the multilateral convention with respect to importprohibitions and restrictions would include provisions designed to minimisediscriminatory and other objectionable practices in the administration of suchprohibitions and restrictions as were not prescribed. These rules would embodyprinciples such as those which have been included in the pertinent provisionsof trade agreements concluded by the United States (see, for example, Article Vof the United Kingdom-United States Trade Agreement and Article III of theUnited States-Mexico Trade Agreement).5. Exchange Restrictions.Exchange restrictions should not be applied in a manner inconsistent withthe above provisions for the use of quantitative import restrictions.IV. Export Taxes and Restrictions. *&apos;1. There should be agreed action looking toward the abolition of exporttaxes and restrictions.[26480] e
2. Provision in a general multilateral commercial policy convention for theabolition of quantitative restrictions on exports, including prohibitions, wouldin general be subject to the same carefully safeguarded exceptions as may beagreed upon in respect of quantitative restrictions on imports, in so far as theymay be pertinent (e.g., quantitative regulations imposed pursuant to recognisedinternational commodity agreements, &amp;c). In addition, it probably would benecessary to provide for exceptions in respect of quantitative export regulations which are (1) imposed under conditions of famine or severe domestic shortage in the exporting country, and (2) designed to regulate the trade in military supplies under specified conditions.3. Export taxes and other forms of government action which result in thesale of goods in foreign markets at prices higher than those corresponding to the domestic prices would be banned, subject to an exception for export taxesimposed for purposes of revenue. A revenue tax might be defined as one whichdoes not result in the sale of a product for export at a price higher than thatcorresponding to the price charged in the home market. Examples of revenuetaxes might be the following : (a) A tax on the export of a manufactured product which is compensated for by an equivalent tax on the domestic consumption of that product.(b) A tax on the export of a raw material which is compensated for by an equivalent tax on the raw material consumed by a domestic manufac-turing industry, whether for home consumption or export.(c) A- tax on the export of a raw material which is not consumeddomestically as a raw material by a manufacturing industry.It should be noted that in cases in which a country exports the whole of asubstantial part of the world&apos;s supply of a scarce commodity, and has no substan-tial home consumption of that commodity, compliance with the above definition of revenue export taxes would not serve as a check on the height, of the tax.Moreover, under such conditions importing countries would be forced to payable tax almost any height because of the absence of adequate alternative sources of supply. In such cases importing countries should be enabled to refer the matter to the proposed international commercial policy organisation.4. The convention would provide that revenue taxes, and, under like circum-stances and conditions, permissible quantitative restrictions, imposed on exports from any area, would be applied uniformly irrespective of destination.V. Subsidies.1. Subsidies are preferable to tariffs and other import restrictions as a means of protecting domestic industries because (a) they do not impose burdens on consumers, and (b) being visible, they are likely to be employed less frequentlyand for shorter duration than tariff and other import restrictions.2. However, export subsidies and other government action which results inthe sale of goods in foreign markets at prices lower than those corresponding tothe prices charged for like products in the home market (hereinafter referred toas export subsidies) are objectionable from the standpoint of commercial policyIn so far as they are effective, they cause uneconomic diversions of trade, workunjust hardships on competitors and engender international ill will.3. In any comprehensive international convention with respect to commercial policy that may be concluded, provision should be made looking to the elimination of export subsidies, including all forms of the two-price system, as soon aspracticable. Efforts would be made to induce countries parties to such a conven-tion to adopt less objectionable methods of assisting industries which they deemrequire State aid.4. Programmes for the subsidisation of products which do not result inselling for export at prices less than those corresponding to the domestic prices,would not be banned. Further consideration should be given to the question ofinsuring that such subsidisation is kept within moderate limits and, in particular,to the question of setting a limit to the subsidisation of the production of goods of which world surpluses exist. The discussions have shown clearly that thepossibility of obtaining adherence to any rule prohibiting, in surplus areas, export subsidies on certain agricultural products in excess world supply will depend upon the possibility of setting definite limits to the subsidisation of production in deficit areas (see also Section on Commodity Policy, IV, Subsidies). There wouldprobably have to be appropriate agreed exceptions for infant trades, securilv
measures, &amp;c. (see I, Tariffs, paragraph 4; and III., Quantitative import restrictions, paragraph 1).5. Consideration probably should be given to the desirability of including, atthe appropriate place in any commercial policy convention, provisions with respectto export dumping by individual producers and associations of producers (see I,Tariffs, paragraph 5).6. Provision would be made for review by the proposed international com-mercial policy organisation in cases where a country believed that domesticsubsidies were in effect concealed or indirect export subsidies and that its interests were injured. The remission of taxes on exported goods probably should not beconsidered as an export subsidy within the meaning of this provision.VI. State Trading.1. Prior to the war one government, the Soviet Union, had a monopoly ofthe country&apos;s entire foreign trade and in other countries governmental tradingwas practised to some extent. It is not unlikely that conditions created by the warwill tend to result in State trading on a more extensive scale than theretofore.2. It is necessary, therefore, that methods and arrangements for tradingbetween private-enterprise countries and State-trading countries, whetherbilateral or multilateral, be such as to take account of this situation in order thatthe interests of both may be harmonised.3. The general objective of such methods and arrangements should be tomaximise the economic use of resources by : (a) elimination of discrimination; and(b) expansion of trade.4. Any principles that may be adopted, by private-enterprise countries withrespect to trade relations with State-trading countries must cover satisfactorilythe three general types of State trading, as follows : (a) complete State monopoly of a country&apos;s foreign trade;(b) State or State-sponsored monopoly of the trade in particular productsonly; and(c) non-monopolistic State trading.5. Creation of government-trading organisations by private enterprisecountries to deal with State-trading countries. Private-enterprise countries might be disposed to adopt the policy of creating State, or State-sponsored,trading organisations to handle their trade with State-trading countries with aview to improving their bargaining power and thereby obtaining better terms oftrade.  Such a course would be open to the following objections : (a) Discrimination against other countries is likely to result from suchpractices. The creation of a government-trading organisation in aprivate-enterprise country to deal with a State-trading country might lead to barter-type arrangements between the two countries, withresulting discrimination usually associated with such arrangements.Large purchases by the private-enterprise country, induced by the&apos;opportunity for large scales, might reduce the market for competingproducts of third countries.(b) If private-enterprise countries were to adopt State trading to deal withState trading elsewhere, there might be a progressive substitution ofState trading for private enterprise.(c) Moreover,  it  is  questionable whether  the  difficulty  such  arrange-ments would be designed to meet will in reality prove a very seriousone. Available evidence based on past experience does not suggestthat State-trading countries have in fact taken advantage of theirstrong negotiating position to the real detriment of competingindividual traders in other countries.Consequently, it is suggested that government action in private-enterprisecountries should be confined to ordinary trade control measures, within the limitsset by the general commercial policy convention, which set the conditions underwhich private traders can conduct business with the foreign State-trading country, just as they do in the case of trade with private-enterprise countries.In that case, in any agreements between governments of State-trading countries and private-enterprise countries, the concessions made by the Tatter would be of[&quot;26480]        &apos;   &apos; e 2
exactly the same kind as those made to private-enterprise countries, i.e.,concessions designed to improve the opportunities for trade by the State-trading country with private traders in the private-enterprise country.6. Bilateral minimum purchase commitments from particular supplying countries. A possible type of agreement would be one whereby a State-trading country undertakes a minimum purchase commitment, of all products or specifiedproducts, such purchases to be made in the supplying country party to thearrangement as a quid pro quo for relaxation of barriers to trade with private interests in the supplying country.Such an arrangement is objectionable because it tends to discriminate amongsupplying countries; i.e., comparative costs and competitive market conditionsmight exist or develop, whereby the State-trading country would be compelled, ifit complied with the specified minimum purchase commitment, to purchase goods from the other country party&apos; to the arrangement which could be purchased more economically elsewhere. The same objection does not apply to long-term contracts made by State-trading organisations on terms based solely on commercial considerations.7. Purchases allocated in consultation with suppliers. Under such anarrangement the State-trading country desiring to purchase specified commoditieswould allocate them in a non-discriminatory manner among the supplying countries on the basis of multilateral consultation and agreement between the interested governments.Such an arrangement might in some cases be impracticable because of thetime consumed in making arrangements for numerous specific transactions andthe possibility of disputes among sellers. It would presumably require continuousand active participation by the governments concerned with respect to particularcommercial transactions. There may be cases in which such negotiated arrange-ments may prove the least objectionable method of allocating markets.8. Purchases solely on basis of commercial considerations. Under such anarrangement the State-trading country might purchase any commodity abroadeither from private traders or the government of any supplying country without prior consultation with the governments of countries which were alternative sources of supply, subject merely to the general undertaking that such purchasesshall be governed solely by commercial considerations (e.g., Article VIII, UnitedKingdom-United States trade agreement) and with possible provision for appeal by an interested government to, and review by, the proposed international commercial policy organisation.Such an arrangement would provide a general basis for assuring non-discriminatory treatment without, however, imposing any contractual limitation on the degree of protection of domestic industry by the State-trading country.Such assurances of nondiscriminatory treatment, however, are essential to any international-arrangements for dealing with State trading.. 9. Provisions to limit the use of State monopolies in giving excess protection to home production. Countries might undertake not to give greater protectionby means of State trading than they would be permitted to do under the otherclauses of the general commercial convention., (1) The relationship between theprice paid to the foreign supplier and the price charged to the home consumer,and (2) the question whether the monopoly was satisfying the full domestic demand for the foreign product, might help to determine whether the degree ofprotection exceeded that allowed by any maximum specified in the section dealingwith tariff policy. These criteria would be applied in combination with provisions for nondiscriminatory treatment as in point 8, above.These criteria would not preclude such direct subsidies as may be permitted in the case of non-monopolised goods to either domestic producers or consumers inrespect of like or similar domestic products (see V, Subsidies, above). Also, ifrevenue tariffs are to be excepted from any rule limiting the height of tariffs, acorresponding exception will probably have to be made in the case of productsmonopolised and sold at a high price domestically primarily for revenue ratherthan protective purposes. If in the case of State-trading monopolies an appro-priate limit could be set between, on the one hand, the price paid to the foreignsupplier and, on the other hand, the price paid to the domestic producer, or thatcharged to the domestic consumer (whichever is the lower), suitable allowance willhave been made both for subsidies on domestic production and for the use ofmonopolised trading for revenue purposes.
The utility of any such price criterion is necessarily limited. It is likely tobe readily applicable only to single-product monopolies in private-enterprisecountries. Moreover, certain administrative problems would arise in connectionwith such a rule; e.g., the problem of determining equitable processing anddistribution costs. This would involve the problem of defining and determining the price paid the foreign supplier, and of defining the selling price, particularlyin the case of products not ready for direct consumption, including, when the monopoly sold domestic as well as foreign goods, the allocation of processing anddistribution costs between foreign and domestic supplies.  .For these reasons a price criterion of this kind cannot be used as a precise andarithmetical rule. Nevertheless, if&apos; countries adopting State-trading monopolieswere to undertake not to use such monopolies to give protection to their domestic production in excess of the amount of protection permitted under the otherclauses of the multilateral commercial policy convention, these price relationshipsmight be used as a general guide in considering any complaint that a particular country is using a trading monopoly to provide excessive protection to its domestic production.10. Minimum global purchase commitment by a State-trading countryunallocated by countries. Under such an arrangement the State-trading country,in return for tariff and other trade concessions from private-enterprise countries,would undertake to purchase abroad not less than specified amounts, either ofparticular products or of total imports, depending on whether the commitment ismade in bilateral agreements or in a multilateral convention.Reasonable flexibility in regard to such minimum purchase commitmentmight be provided by an escape clause relating to the country&apos;s foreign exchangeavailabilities.Such arrangements should include provisions assuring non-discriminatorytreatment.The countries negotiating bilateral agreements with State-trading countries on this basis could, as compensation for tariff or other trade concessions to thelatter, select products of particular export interest to them in respect of whichminimum purchase commitments unallocated among supplying countries would bemade by the State-trading country. In this way they could negotiate agreements for bringing about an expansion of their trade with the State-trading country without causing the latter to discriminate against the trade of any other country,since in this as in other cases there would be a general commitment on the part ofState-trading countries to buy always in the best market.Similarly, in a multilateral convention a country with a complete Statemonopoly of foreign trade might equitably be asked to give a commitment withrespect to its total imports in view of the fact that the multilateral convention would be conferring benefits on the State-trading country in the form of relaxation-tion of trade barriers by all of the other parties to the convention.Undertakings of the sort above indicated might well foster increasing-participation in world trade on the part of State-trading countries such as theSoviet Union, on the basis of productive aptitudes.11. Conclusions. .      - .(a) A general multilateral commercial policy convention for the expansionof international trade on a non-discriminatory basis, which should be so devisedthat countries having a complete State monopoly of foreign trade can associate themselves with it, might contain a commitment whereby such countries would agree to purchase from outside sources goods to a total specified value, withoutspecifying particular countries or products. Such a commitment on the partof a country having a complete State monopoly of foreign trade could be con-sidered a counterpart to measures for the relaxation of trade barriers whichprivate-enterprise countries would be undertaking, to make effective pursuant tosuch a convention.(6) A country having a monopoly for the whole or- part of its foreign trade might be asked to agree not to use such a monopoly so as to give protection toits domestic producers in excess of that which would be permitted under otherclauses of the convention. The relation between the prices paid to foreignsuppliers and the prices paid to domestic producers or charged to domestic consumers might in some cases help to determine whether State-trading mono-monopolies were being misused for the purpose of giving excessive protection. Thiscriterion is likely to be effectively applicable only to single-product monopoliesin private-enterprise countries.
(c) Such a general multilateral commercial policy convention snould alsolay down the general principles to govern the practices of State-trading Countries,partial or complete, and the principles to govern the negotiation of agreements with such countries, including the following : (1) That purchases and sales by governments shall conform to the principlethat they shall be made in accordance solely with commercial considera-tions, as provided&apos; in Article VIII of the United States-UnitedKingdom trade agreement; and accordingly,(2) that purchases of specified quantities of goods by any State-trading country, provided for in any inter-governmental agreement, shall notbe limited to purchases in the other&quot; country or countries participating in the agreement, but shall be global purchases to be made in thecountry or countries best able to supply the goods, except possiblycountries not participating in the general multilateral convention. Afurther exception might be made in cases where purchases areallocated in accordance with an agreement among the principalcountries supplying and consuming the goods in question (see para-graph 7, above). ,This clause is not intended to preclude contracts for purchases by State-trading organisations provided that they do not conflict with the principle laid down in point c (1), above.(d) It is suggested that government action in private-enterprise countries intrading with State monopolies in other countries should be confined to their normal trade control measures (such as adjustment of tariffs) exercised within thelimits set by the general commercial policy convention rather than that theyshould institute special counter-monopolies.(e) During a temporary period after the cessation of hostilities, the lengthof which should be laid down in the multilateral commercial policy convention,member countries might be excused from the strict application of the foregoingrules to their trading monopolies in those cases in which emergency conditions(such as shortages of supplies, of shipping or of foreign exchange, or the need to dispose of temporary surplus stocks) necessitate exceptional action.VII. International Commercial Policy Organisation.1. The creation of an appropriate international commercial policy organisa-tion seems essential to the successful operation of any general multilateralcommercial policy convention.. Discussions regarding the possible subject-matterof such a convention have disclosed that it would be desirable to include thereinseveral provisions, some of vital importance, which could be made workable only with the assistance of some organisation representing all the member countries.Among these would be provisions for the application by the organisation ofstated criteria to : (a) future customs unions; (&amp;) quantitative import regulationsimposed on grounds of balance-of-payments difficulties; (c) State-trading operations; (d) revenue tariffs; (e) subsidy programmes; and (/) exportrestrictions imposed on grounds of severe domestic shortage.2. In general, the purposes of the proposed international commercial policy organisation would be as follows : (a) To provide information to member countries regarding the implement a-tion of the convention by other member countries.(b) To afford a source of consistent interpretation regarding the provisionsof the convention.(c) To carry out investigative  and  fact-finding  functions required  orpermitted by the provisions of the convention.(d) To provide a mechanism for the consideration of complaints, the adjust-ment of differences, and appropriate action in cases of non-observance of the convention.(e) To recommend to member countries any amendments to the convention which appear desirable in the light of experience.3. Further consideration might show the desirability, for administrativereasons of providing within the proposed commercial policy organisation for :(1) a Council, or supervisory body, representing all member&apos;countries, to whichwould be referred important policy matters; and (2) a Commission, or operatingbody, preferably a small group assisted by a staff of experts, which would carry outinvestigative and fact-finding functions and consider minor complaints, &amp;c,
&apos; subject to periodic review by the Council. It is believed the organisation shouldbe guided by a set of general rules, made as precise as possible, which would beincluded in the convention, in order to avoid burdening it with too great a measureof responsibility.4. In addition to the proposed international organisation on commercial policy, consideration is being or may be given to the creation of separate inter-national organisations to deal with problems of currency stabilisation, commodity agreements, and possibly others such as international investment and cartels,the membership of which may not be identical. In view of the closely relatedcharacter of these fields, and the possibility that measures might be taken by oneorganisation which would be inconsistent with measures taken by the others, itis suggested that consideration be given to some form of economic organisation to co-ordinate their activities (see also Section on International Co-ordinationof Measures for the Maintenance of High Levels of Employment, below).5. - It is believed that the convention should be so drawn as to be open toadherence by all nations. Ex-enemy countries should, of course, be allowed tobecome members of the proposed convention. In view of their recent commercialhistory, and for reasons of security they might well be compelled to join, if itshould prove necessary.6. Parties to the convention should be required to give each other most-favoured-nation treatment. Nations which, after invitation, have refused toparticipate in the proposed convention, should be denied its benefits. Unlessmember nations are required to deny such benefits, for example their tariff reduc-tions, to the trade of non-members, there might be a strong tendency on theone hand for nations to remain outside the convention and bargain individuallywith member nations, and on the other hand for member nations to compete with each other in obtaining special favours from non-member nations. It is proposedthat the general rule against granting the benefits of the convention to non-member nations might be relaxed by empowering the international commercial policy organisation to recommend exceptions in justified cases.ANNEX B.Commercial Policy.Introductory Note.As has been stated on many occasions, the Government of the UnitedKingdom favours a commercial policy designed to promote general economic expansion and action directed towards the removal of the obstacles to inter-national trade, and is specially desirous to co-operate with the Government of theUnited States in joint endeavours to promote these aims. While, during the transitional period immediately after the war when we are seeking to restore our balance of trade, we may have to retain some special measures of control, we hopethat we and other countries will be able to emerge from this stage without undue delay. It is with this in mind, and as a contribution to the conversations on post-War economic reconstruction which we are about to undertake, that the UnitedKingdom Government submits for consideration the following points which forma practical approach to this problem, and which might prove suitable fordiscussion among the United Nations.The proposals of the United Kingdom Government involve the establishmentof a general code of rules for the regulation of international commercialbehaviour, and of an appropriate international institution. The ground coveredby this suggested code is somewhat wider than that which would be relevant to thediscussion of a normal bilateral trade agreement. This is not because the UnitedKingdom Government is unmindful of the importance of the method of bilateraltrade agreements or of the extent to which this method has already contributed tothe clearance of the channels of trade, but rather because it is felt that there arecertain problems which are less susceptible of treatment in this manner, whichnevertheless deserve consideration in the comprehensive review &quot;which we are about to make.(i) An international commercial policy capable of helping towards thesolution of the post-war economic and political problems would have tobe -accompanied by international policies conducive to a high level of
employment, production and consumption; to improved standards of *living; and, in general, to an expansive world economy. It requiressome system for the free convertibility of currencies for tradingpurposes. Further, an essential condition of success is the develop-ment of effective political and strategic plans for the achievement of security.(ii) The policy should- also be based on the assumption of a multilateralcommercial agreement, embracing as many countries as possible.Bilateral agreements by themselves, however advantageous, cannot inour view fully meet the needs of the general situation, whereas a multilateral agreement, laying down certain principles for the freerexchange of commodities, can be of great benefit. These considera-tions weigh particularly heavily for a country such as our own which,being dependent on imports for a large proportion of her food and rawmaterials, is especially interested in the maintenance of an adequatevolume of exports. The multilateral convention would not, of course,exclude supplementary bilateral agreements within the framework ofthe multilateral agreement.(iii) The United Kingdom, both by tradition and by experience, regards anincreased freedom of trade as particularly in her interest. We shalljoin in any movement to secure it and, when it comes down to practice,we should have every motive to encourage it, both from our own pointof view and on account of the general international benefit. our sympathy is entirely with those who are seeking to remove barriers totrade. Any qualifications we may have to make will be due to thespecial difficulties of the immediate post-war period and the present uncertainty as to what will, in fact, lie within our power and that ofother countries.(iv) We consider that the quantitative regulation of imports should not&quot; ordinarily be employed for the primary purpose of protecting homeindustries, but rather regarded as a mechanism appropriate and useful for special purposes, including, among others, the safeguarding of a country&apos;s balance of payments. We suggest that common agreement might be reached concerning a more or less automatic and objectivetest of the conditions under which such action should be permissible;for example, it might be found that the statistics resulting from thecreation of an international monetary authority could be used for thispurpose.(v) Any multilateral commercial arrangement should be compatible with theconduct of external trade by the State, or by State-sponsored organisa-tions, as well as by private enterprise. But it would be desirable thatforms of trading promoted by State action should be conducted inaccordance with a code to be agreed.(vi) We should be prepared to agree to measures designed to prevent export subsidies.(vii) We would accept an upper limit of moderate height for tariffs for incorporation in a multilateral agreement. The question should beconsidered whether special provisions could be devised to meet, on areasonable scale, the temporary rieeds of infant industries.(viii) We should be prepared to make all our arrangements, includingparticularly quantitative restriction of imports, on a basis of mutualnon-discrimination.   Preferences are dealt with in (ix).(ix) Quite apart from our own position, a general plan should leave room forspecial arrangements within political and geographical groups, since these are likely to be asked for and could be properly conceded in manycases. As part of a comprehensive scheme for the betterment of thetrade of the world as a whole, we should be prepared to play our full part in any general scheme for reducing preferences,(x) We believe that these points could best be covered by the formulation of ageneral commercial code to which all countries would be invited to subscribe, and by the establishment of an appropriate internationalinstitution.Washington, 11th September, 1943.
.  ANNEX C.Commercial Policy.Illustrative Outline of Proposals.The following outline is put forward as an illustration of one way in whichthe principles suggested in the Introductory Note on Commercial Policy might beapplied in a general multilateral convention. Such a convention would establish a general code of rules for the regulation of international commercial behaviour,together with an appropriate international institution.A. Quantitative Import Restrictions.(i) Immediately after the war, there should be an initial period of, say,two years, during which it will be permissible for any Government tocontrol its imports by quantitative restrictions. During these twoyears, however, any country making use of such restrictions would be committed to consult with any country which considered that itsinterests were injured thereby, with a view to ensuring that therestrictions were operated in an equitable and non-discriminatorymanner, and so to cause as little harm as possible to the supplying countries. If agreement could not be reached in such consultations,the Commercial Union (see section G below) would use its offices witha view to conciliation. In appropriate cases there should be consulta-tion, both during the initial period and subsequently, between theCommercial Union and the International Labour Organisation, whichis particularly well qualified to deal with international labour standards.(ii) Governments should undertake on joining the Commercial Union thatat the end of this two-year period they would remove their import restrictions by progressive steps over a period of, say, three years,except in the case of the categories mentioned below or other categoriesapproved by the Commercial Union. The approved categories would cover, in addition to the usual exceptions on grounds of health, &amp;c,action under the following heads :-(a) In respect of recognised international commodity agreements andother special agreements affecting the production of and/or trade in particular commodities which may be reached between two or more Governments and approved by the commercial union;(6) On the ground of balance of payments difficulties. It might bepossible to devise a more or less automatic and objective test ofthe conditions under which action on these grounds should be permissible; and(c) Subject to the approval of the Commercial Union, in consultation as regards political aspects with any other appropriate international body, for the protection of industries necessary on grounds of security.Non-discrimination as between members of the Commercial Union,should be the aim in all action permitted under these categories.(iii) Exchange restrictions on current payments (as distinct from capital movements) should not be applied in a manner inconsistent with theabove-mentioned objectives.B. State Trading.(i) The multilateral commercial convention should be compatible with theconduct of external trade by the State or State-sponsored organise,tions, as well as by private enterprise.(ii) The discriminatory misuse of State trading should be prevented by rulesbased generally on Article 8 of the United States-United Kingdom.Trade Agreement of 1938. These might provide that State tradingmonopolies should be guided solely by economic considerations,(iii) State trading organisations should be permitted to make contracts forlonger periods than normal commercial consideration would dictate.Where buffer stock schemes exist, such contracts should be made only[26480] F
within the range of the buffer stock prices. For other commoditiesthe long-term contracts should, wherever possible, be thrown open to a form of international tender. The limitation on protection by meansof tariffs (see section D below) should provide a criterion for judgingwhether such purchases were excessively protective. The latterprovision is intended to refer primarily to State purchases for re-sale.Any such limitation would be difficult to impose in the ease of Statepurchases for the Government&apos;s own use.(iv) Where a State trades through a monopoly, countries with which it dealsshould be allowed to canalise their transactions with it through a monopoly of their own, such action not being regarded asdiscriminatory.C. Subsidies.(i) State action (by direct or indirect subsidies or by means of state trading) which results in the sale of goods in foreign markets at priceslower than those corresponding to the prices charged in the home market should be forbidden.(ii) Apart from this, there appears to be a case for leaving States free toprotect home production by means of direct and open State subsidies.However, every effort should be made to ensure that such subsidies are confined within moderate limits.D. Tariffs.(i) There should be established for all ad valorem duties an upper limit ofx per cent, with a corresponding limit for specific duties,(ii) Duties below this upper limit should be reduced by y per cent, of theirlevel as at the outbreak of war, with the proviso that no duty need bereduced below 10 per cent, ad volorem.(iii). These proposals should relate only to the protective element in duties(i.e., they would not limit revenue duties),(iv) The proposals would be subject to any exceptions that might be approvedby the Commercial Union, in consultation as regards political aspectswith any other appropriate international body, for the protection ofindustries necessary on grounds of security,(v) The question might be considered whether special provisions could be devised to meet, on a reasonable scale, the temporary needs of infantindustries.E. Preferences.(i) Existing preferential margins (whether under Imperial Preference inthe United Kingdom and other Empire countries or in foreignEmpires or in regional arrangements between foreign countries)should be reduced by z per cent, of their level as at the outbreak ofwar, with the proviso that no preferential margin need be reduced below 5 per cent, ad valorem.(ii) No new preferences should be permitted in existing preferential areas;and no new preferences or Custom Unions should be established in anyother areas, without the approval of the Commercial Union, inconsultation as regards political aspects with any other appropriate international body.F. Export Taxes and Restrictions.Such devices should be subject to rules generally similar to those proposed forimport taxes and restrictions.G. The Commercial Union.(i) The suggested code of rules regarding commercial policy should be embodied in a multilateral convention, which would establish aCommercial Union of the adherent States. This multilateral conven-tion would not exclude supplementary bilateral agreements within the framework of the multilateral agreement.(ii) The member States should be required to give most-favoured-nation treatment to each other. They should be permitted to refuse most-favoured-nation treatment to non-member States.
(iii) To prevent the formation of rival economic blocs, every endeavour shouldbe made to secure the adherence of all the United Nations and of leading neutral countries to the Convention.(iv) Subject to the general reservation that it will have to be decided in otherconnections what commercial terms are to be imposed on ex-enemy states, such States should be required to adhere to the Union (probably on terms) in order to prevent them from developing again an autarkiceconomy and exercising improper economic pressure on their neighbours.(v) The Commercial Union cannot work satisfactorily without the existenceof an international monetary body. At the same time, the observance of the rules of the Commercial Union should greatly facilitate theworking of any such monetary organisation. Tor this reason it is amatter for consideration whether membership of the two bodies shouldbe common. States which find one or the other the more attractive tothem might thus be induced to become members of both. The grounds for requiring any members of the Commercial Union to adhere also tothe monetary organisation appear particularly strong.International Institutions.(i) The Commercial Union would need the institution of a Council orConference of its members to supervise its operation and to developits objectives. This body should possess the ultimate power ofexpelling from the Union any member State which persistentlydisregarded the rules of the Union,(ii) The above proposals also require the institution of a fact-finding body with quasi-judicial functions. For this purpose there might be instituted an international Commerce Commission, to which anymember State could appeal when it was aggrieved by any action of another member State in contravention of the rules of the Union. Anaggrieved State should be free to take immediate countervailingcommercial action against the offending member, but should be obliged to take the case for decision by the International CommerceCommission and to accept the decision of that body.Washington, 17th September, 1943.[26480]

III.INTERNATIONAL COMMODITY POLICY.Covering Report.IN so far as they were concerned with the control of primary products, the conversations at Washington did not take place on ground that was completelyunbroken; they had been preceded by the Hot Springs Conference, at which certain broad principles of commodity regulation came under general review.But, whereas at Hot Springs it had been our intention to indicate certain possiblelines of development, but so far as possible to avoid discussion, at Washington itwas clearly desirable to go beyond this to attempt to discover how far it waspossible to agree on the main principles of policy and on the broad outline of aninternational organisation, and, where disagreements lurked in the background,to bring them out into the open and discuss them in all candour. We conceivedit to be our object to discover to what extent we could agree with the Americanson a statement which, if it were accepted by our respective Governments, mightbe regarded as a directive to a drafting committee, composed of representativemembers of the United Nations, set up to elaborate the details of a specific plan.2. As a guide to the conduct of the negotiations, we were provided with the document on Commodity Policy which had been discussed among departments and with the Dominions, and with instructions concerning the degree of reservewhich we were to express concerning those parts of the document which sanctionedquantitative regulation.3. Before reaching Washington we had some discussion with regard to thequestion whether our document should be shown to the Americans. We agreedprovisionally that it would be better, at first at any rate, to keep it in the back-ground, seeking to guide the discussion towards the construction of an agreed statement rather than inviting comment on our own plan.4. In the event, however, it was not found possible to do this. At the firstmeeting of the joint Group, the Americans disclosed that, as a result of the HotSprings Conference, they had set up a small committee to consider commodity policy and that this committee had produced a tentative report, which they proposed to place at the disposal of the Committee. In these circumstances itwould obviously have been most disadvantageous to have withheld our documentany longer. Accordingly it, too, was placed, at the disposal of the committee with a covering letter drawing attention both to its informal and non-committalcharacter, and to the nature of the reserves with which we approached the sectiondealing with the quantitative regulation. In doing this we were aware thatwe ran the risk of creating a position in which we might have to debate the claim of rival plans. But this seemed to be less serious than the risk of having the workof the Committee confined to discussions of the American document alone. Infact, their report, although on a much more pedestrian level than our own, proved to run so very parallel to it on the main guiding lines of policy, that there was never any question of discussing rival plans in the large. Throughout the conversations, the two documents served merely, to provide convenient indications of our respective positions on particular problems as these came up for orderlyreview.5. . The major problem with which we were confronted arose not from theexistence of rival plans, but from the composition of the American Group which,at the outset at any rate, was far from representing a homogeneous point of view.On the one wing was Mr. Will Clayton, who was avowedly sceptical of the valueof any form of regulation; on the other, Mr. Paul Appleby, who, at Hot Springs,had appeared to be associated with some of the more extreme expressions of thepolicy of agrarian restrict! onism. In the centre, there was a bloc of state department Officials, the chief authors of the American document, whose viewsseemed to coincide very largely with our own. Our problem., therefore, was atonce to persuade Mr. Clayton that the forms of regulation which we proposeddid not justify his fears, and to make Mr. Appleby see that, whereas we couldnot agree to policies which would have the effect of turning the long-period termsof trade artificially against us, we were proposing measures which mightjustifiably be held to bring substantial benefit to the position of agrarianproducers.6. These tactics were attended with a very fair degree&apos; of success. By theend,Mr. Clayton was able to declare that the principles agreed upon provided,in his judgment, effective safeguards against the abuses of commodity regulation;and once he had become persuaded that our proposal with regard to buffer stocks
was not merely a false scent designed to side-track serious discussion of theproblems of primary p reduction, Mr. Appleby showed himself to be most friendly and accommodating. Speaking generally, the tone of the conversations was very satisfactory. There was much plain speaking, but no ill-temper; and, as the days went by, there was a genuine meeting of minds in an attempt to find mutuallyacceptable solutions. Whatever may be said of the positive outcome of the conversations, we can at least claim for them that they provided a most valuableopportunity for creating a common understanding.7. It is perhaps worth noting that a factor which contributed very muchto the cordial atmosphere in which the conversations were conducted was therevelation at the outset that, in order to keep its hands free for international discussions, the British Government had decided not to renew the Rubber Agree-ment in its old form. As some of us had suspected, the impact of this on ourAmerican friends was altogether disproportionate to its intrinsic importance.It was exactly the kind of gesture which they had least expected; and although some of them exercised considerable speculative ingenuity to discover its real&quot; inwardness,&quot; there can be no doubt that its net effect was greatly to disarmthe suspicion with which our earlier adumbrations of policy had been greeted.8. In the main, the joint statement which emerged from the deliberations ofthe Committee embodies principles which are substantially identical with those laid down in the British Document. It lays down a series of objectives of com-commodity policy which are similar to the objectives laid down in our introduction.It sets out broad outlines of an international organisation for commodity regula-tion which, in most important respects, resembles our own plan for an inter-national commodity council and its ancillary commodity authorities. it recognises the functions and objectives of buffer stock regulation; and in so faras it permits of quantitative regulation, it provides safeguards which are probably more reliable than those which we had originally suggested.9. There are, however, certain differences which deserve to be clearly stated : :(a) The proposals in the agreed statement do not involve so great a surrender of sovereignty on the part of various participating States as wassuggested in our document. Thus, whereas the British Documentproposed that the States participating in international commodtiyorganisation should bind themselves to accept its ruling regardingcommodity agreements, the suggestions of the agreed statementprovide rather that the International Commodity Organisation shallreview and report upon international commodity regulations beforethe participating Governments make their final decision. This way of putting things was suggested by the Americans, who have their ownconstitutional difficulties in this respect, and was agreed to by us, since we felt that the sentences in our own document which implied some-thing further than this, went probably beyond what had been thegeneral intention of its authors.(6) In the British paper, the coming into force of quantitative regulationwas made subject to the test that the price prevailing was below what might be described as a &quot; reasonable economic price &quot; for the majorityof its producers. This stipulation occurred in that paragraph 14with regard to which Ministers had already expressed a generalreservation of judgment. And as the discussions proceeded, it becamevery clear to us that it might be easily construed so as to justifyquantitative regulation over a much wider field than would be either generally appropriate or in our own national interest. In the inter-war years, there were few primary products which, at some time or another, on this test could not have been made out to be eligible forquantitative regulation. It therefore seemed desirable to tackle theproblem in another way, namely, by securing recognition that such arrangements should be regarded as essentially &quot; transitory measuresto be introduced only where there is persisting disequlibrium betweensupply and demand,&quot; and by ensuring that, where such arrangements were brought into being, tbey should be subject to extensive safe-guards and managed according to rules designed to bring about thefundamental changes which would ultimately make them unnecessarv.In this we were successful. The Americans in their own document had expressed the view that every care should be taken that the inter-national commodity organisation should not become the &quot; spawningground of restriction &apos;&apos;; and they showed every willingness to ao-reeto the principle of equal representation of importing and exportinginterests.   It is safe to say that any differences of opinion which
remain concerning the applicability of quantitative regulation dependfar more upon differences of view concerning the general prospects ofinternational trade in the post-war period than upon any differenceconcerning the principles which determine when quantitativeregulations should be applied.10. In the course of the discussions, the question was raised concerning the relation between the proposed International Commodity Organisation and thePermanent Organisation for Food and Agriculture, which is to be set up as aresult of the deliberations of the Hot Springs Conference. This promised to be avery delicate subject. It was known that certain members of the Interim Corn-mission, which is now elaborating a constitution for the Permanent Organisation,were strongly in favour of giving to that body positive powers in regard tocommodity arrangements a proposal which is definitely ruled out by the instruc-tions to the British Delegate-and it was feared that Mr. Appleby, who has played a great part in the work of the Interim Commission, would also take this line. These fears proved to be without justification. After a friendly discussion,in which the dangers of conflicting authorities in regard to commodity arrange-ments were clearly set forth by the British Delegation and accepted by the americans, Mr. Appleby indicated that his point of view would be fully met if arrangements were made whereby the Permanent Organisation should beorganically linked with the International Commodity Organisation by the rightof some degree of representation on the governing body. This proposal seemedso eminently reasonable that, while making it clear that we had no authority tocome to any final conclusion on this matter, we accepted its inclusion in the agreed statement.11/ The one point on which it was not possible to secure agreed recommend a-tions relates to subsidies. The British Document had urged that, because of thedislocations brought about in international commodity markets by subsidies(particularly if they operate as export subsidies), it was desirable that any sub-subsidies affecting commodities which are the subject of control schemes should be&quot; confined within moderate limits and limited to produce which is consumed, aswell as produced, at home.&quot;The Americans did not contest this view as regards export subsidies, but.urged that similar dislocations were brought about by subsidies to domestic production, and suggested that, where subsidies were allowed in respect of commodities suitable for international regulation of any kind, they should be accompanied by quantitative limits on the amount of subsidised production. Tohave conceded this would have been to go beyond our instructions in regard to commercial Policy, where the use of the subsidy as a safety-valve was one of theprinciples of the scheme which was being put forward by the British Delegation.On this point, therefore, we were compelled to reserve our position.12. At Hot Springs, there had been some talk of c&apos; parity,&apos;&apos; in the sense ofa fixed and more favourable relation between agricultural and manufacturingprices, being adopted as an objective of commodity policy; and when we firstarrived in Washington there were some indications that this age-old red herringmight once more be drawn across the trail. Accordingly, we determined to bringthe issue out into the open. We said that &quot; parity &quot; was not an objective whichcould be accepted by Plis Majesty&apos;s Government. We urged the well-knowntheoretical arguments against arrangements of this degree of inflexibility. Wepointed out how dangerous the concept of parity was if introduced into thepolitics of any one country, and how utterly meaningless and unworkable it became if applied in the international field. And we made it quite clear thatit was inconceivable that any British Government should consent to arrangements which would raise the prices of its imports to an artificially high level. At thesame time, we indicated that we were by no means urging a policy of laisser fairein this matter. We recognised that the imperfections of the commodity markets and the incidence of deflation often brought it about that the position of primaryproducers was seriously prejudiced; and we urged that the policies we weresuggesting in regard to buffer stocks should be regarded as. a real contribution tothe solution of this fixed problem ^a contribution which, moreover, was altogetherimmune from the charge that it imposed inflexibility in a sphere where flexibilityis clearly one of the most urgent desiderata. A price &quot; fair both to producers and consumers,&quot; we argued, was a price from which the perverse and arbitraryinfluences of speculation and deflation had been eliminated, and that was essentially our goal. Moreover, we hoped that the position of primary producersmight also be improved by other measures of general economic policy, inparticular, by certain forms of international investment. The effect of all thiswas wholly to the good. Many of the Americans were already on our side; and,as the argument proceeded step by step, the others came to realise that any other
position was untenable, if any sort of agreement was to be reached. In the end,when we caused to be inserted in. the draft report a paragraph recognising a difference of view on this matter, Mr. Appleby himself asked that it should be withdrawn, declaring that differences 310 longer existed.13. The upshot of all this is that, save on the subsidy question, we have brought back a document which represents substantial agreement on the main questions we were deputed to discuss. It is, of course, understood that theUnited States Government is not in any way committed, and it is always a littledifficult to say to what extent the utterances of American officials represent theviews which their Ministers would be willing to see regarded even as a possible basis for action. As has been noted above, the particular group with which wewere confronted did not convey the impression of standing for any very clearly defined or unified initial conceptions; and it is not easy to predict what collectiveweight they will exert now that the conversations are over. It is possible that theinternal unity which they eventually achieved might dissolve under the stress oflocal criticism. Nevertheless, an agreed statement has been drawn up. Thequestion therefore arises whether Ministers consider that the general policy itembodies should be adopted and whether, after further consultation with theDominions, the United States Government should be invited to make it the basisof joint discussions with other members of the United Nations.14. In determining this question, presumably the main issue to be decidedis whether or not the principles and the organisation proposed involve too great a danger of disadvantage to our terms of trade, by the setting up of quantitativecontrols which might raise prices against us [and outweigh any advantage whichwould accrue to us in so far as we were interested, as a trustee for Colonial pro-ducers or as shareholders, in the primary producing industries concernecLj-15. The danger clearly exists. The mere setting up of an international organisation with powers, in certain circumstances, to sanction quantitative regulation implies the possibility that these powers may sometimes be exercised.And there can be no doubt that, on occasion, majorities of the primary producersconcerned&apos; will press very strongly for this to be the case. It might be argued,therefore, that we should be safer if no such organisation existed.16. Against this, however, it can be argued, that in any case, some action islikely to be taken to secure the quantitative regulation of some primary products,and that it is likely to occur less frequently and with less damage to our interestsif it takes place within the framework of an international organisation operatinga code of rules containing due safeguards against abuse than if each case is discussed purely ad hoc in a setting likely to be dominated by producing interests.It is the opinion of those who took part in the Washington conversations that this argument has very considerable force.17. Whatever may be the decision in this respect, it became very clear inthe course of our conversations that the time will very shortly be ripe forcommencing discussions with the Americans with regard to future policyconcerning specific primary products, exj., copper, rubber,&quot;tin, sugar. It may notbe possible to bring it about that these conversations take place under the auspices of an International Commodity Organisation and within the framework of therules suggested in the Washington conversations. But it is certainly desirablethat the measures which are discussed should be based upon a coherent set of principles and that, in each particular case, they should not be markedly out ofstep with the others. It is to be hoped, therefore,&apos;that the steps recently suggested for the reorganisation of the control of commodity policy in Whitehall be speedilycarried through, and that there be constituted some sort of standing interdepart-mental committee which shall advise on the broader aspects of these subjects.&quot;18. One final point. Our discussions of commodity policy were restricted to questions relating to control of primary products. On the question of inter-national cartels concerning manufactured products, the Delegation, as instructed,maintained an attitude of due reserve (see the separate report on the Cartelsdiscussions). It is, however, obvious that the two subjects have a certain logicalconnection. And in the light of our continued insistence on the necessity0 forconfining, within the narrowest bounds, arrangements which restrict the output of primary products, it would be verv difficult for us to maintain an attitude of complete indifference to anything which may be done affecting the output of manufactures. The case against measures designed to raise artificially the pricesof primary products is not likely to be very convincing unless it is accompaniedbv some admission that. the same principles may apply in other parts of theeconomic system.
Annex.Agreed Anglo-American Document on International Commodity Policy.I. General Principles.1. International commodity arrangements should be so framed as to bein harmony with the general expansionist policy which, it is hoped, will be the guiding economic principle of nations in the post-war period i.e., they should ensure a free and full flow of primary products into consumption to the utmostextent compatible with measures which may be necessary, in certain cases, forthe protection of producers. It is, however, recognised that such arrangementscannot be expected, in themselves, to provide full protection for primaryproducers against economic vicissitudes similar to those experienced in the inter-war period; they must be considered as dependent upon and as a corollary towider action designed to promote the expansion of orderly world economy, e.g.,action in the sphere of currency stabilisation, commercial policy and the like.2. It is agreed that the primary objectives of international commodity policy should be  (a) The mitigation of violent short-term price fluctuations.(b) A system which would not only achieve (a) but which would help to counteract business cycles.(c) In general, a state of affairs under which price adjustments would follow changes in the basic conditions of supply and demand and inwhich there would increasing opportunities for supplying worldrequirements from countries able to furnish such requirements most effectively.(d) Provision for special action on an international basis which may be.necessary in cases where.there is persistent disequilibrium betweensupply and demand for the protection of producers and the facilities of orderly change during the transitional periods in which adjust-ments of production to effective demand are being made, particularlyin those cases in which the national Governments have taken or might take independent action to support their producers.II. International Commodity Organisation.1. An international commodity organisation should be established in close association with other international agencies in the field of commercial policy,currency, investment, &amp;c, and should be open to accession by all States.*It will be essential to formulate certain broad principles to determine the corn-position and govern the operations of the organisation and its associated bodies;some of these principles are indicated below.2. As the international commodity organisation will inevitably be con-cerned with a number of agricultural commodities, it will be of particular importance that a very close liaison should be established between it and thePermanent Organisation for Food and Agriculture. For instance, it might wellbe found appropriate to arrange for the Permanent Organisation for Food and agriculture to be represented upon the General Executive of the international commodity Organisation.3. The international commodity organisation would be charged with responsibility for reviewing, supervising and co-ordinating international commodity arrangements of all kinds and, if necessary, for initiating them. Theorganisation would help to form such arrangements and would review andreport upon them before they were submitted to Governments for conclusion.In scrutinising such arrangements the organisation would be required to haveregard to the agreed objectives and principles governing international commodity policy.* There may have to be agreed provisions indicating the terms upon which States shouldbe allowed to join the organisation. The conditions upon which ex-enemy States should be obliged or allowed to join would need special consideration.[26480] g
4. All States participating in the international commodity organisation would undertake that any international arrangements in regard to a primaryproduct involving prices, trade or production, into which they or their nationalspropose to enter or have entered prior to the establishment of the organisation should be communicated in full detail to the international commodity organisa-tion for review and report.5. The principal organ of the international commodity organisation wouldbe a General Commodity Council composed of representatives of all member states, which would have a veto power in respect of action taken by the GeneralExecutive. The votes in the Council would be allocated among its members on a proportional basis, account being.taken of their respective share in international trade. There may, however, have to be special arrangements inthe matter of voting power in the case of elections to the General Executive.Decisions would be made by simple majority of all the votes in the Council.6. The General Council would elect a small General Executive which wouldmake an annual report on its operations to the Council. Each member of theExecutive would have one vote.7. The General Executive should be empowered to establish or approve the creation of individual commodity organisations (which might well be formed in appropriate cases by the adaptation of existing international bodies) to assistit in dealing with particular commodities, as - the agencies responsible to it for conducting operations in accordance with the principles laid down in the con-stitution of the international commodity organisation.It would be a fundamental principle that in the composition of any suchancillary organisations, countries largely dependent upon imports for suppliesof the particular commodity in question should have a combined vote equal tothe exporting countries. Provision should also be made for the appointmentof independent members (i.e., in addition to the representatives of importingand exporting countries by the General Executive).8. Opportunities shall be provided, in the case of any commodity arrange-ment approved by the General Executive, for participation by any countryhaving a substantial interest in the international trade in the commodity inquestion on terms no less favourable than fhose accorded to other countries participating in the arrangements.III.-Methods of International Commodity Policy.1. Buffer stock arrangement.(a) It is agreed that, while the degree to which buffer stock technique is applicable must vary from commodity to commodity, buffer stock arrangements should ensure, in the case of certain important primary products, the moderationof excessive short-term price fluctuations about a long-term equilibrium price.It is desirable that the technical possibilities of introducing buffer stock arrange-ment in regard to certain of the more important commodities entering intointernational trade should be studied further in the light of the plans whichhave been under consideration by both the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates groups.(&amp;) It is hoped that buffer stock arrangements, by operating in a directionopposite to market demand and by acting as a deterrent to speculation, mightmitigate certain of the complex set of forces which are responsible for businesscycles. On the other hand,, too much must not be hoped from such arrangementsif extreme conditions recur such as -those which were experienced more&apos;than once in the inter-war period.2. Quantitative regulation arrangements.(a) There is general agreement that international arrangements involving the quantitative restriction of exports and/or production, should be regardedas transitory measures to be introduced only where there is persisting dis-equilibrium between supply and demand which may necessitate special measures for the protection of producers and the facilitation of orderly change duringthe transitional periods in which adjustments of production to effective demandare being made.
There is a certain difference of emphasis between the two groups in regard tosuch schemes. The United Kingdom group is hopeful that in practice it will bepossible in the case of most commodities to allow long-term price trends to followsupply and demand, and to constitute the primary means of effecting adjustments in productive capacity to balance demand. The United States group considerthat it may well be necessary to have greater recourse to quantitative regulationschemes than is envisaged by the United Kingdom group, in order to mitigate the hardships which would fall on producers during transitional periods and tofacilitate orderly shifting of production by governmental action during suchperiods.(b) It is agreed that if a quantitative regulation scheme is found necessarythis should normally be accompanied and preferably preceded, where practicable,^by a buffer stock arrangement.(c) It is agreed that in all cases international arrangements involving quanti-tative regulation of exports and/or production should be subject to the observance of certain principles in order to insure that the fundamental objectives of inter-national commodity policy are not infringed. These principles comprise,inter alia &apos;(1) Arrangements to insure that on any body which, under the aegis of theGeneral Executive, is charged with the duty of framing and/oroperating a quantitative regulation scheme, there should be equalvoting power between exporting countries and countries largely dependent on importts.(2) It shall be incumbent upon the General Executive, when any proposals are made to it for the introduction of a quantitative regulation scheme,to explore (in so far as it has not already done so) the possibility ofdealing with the root causes of the disequilibrium between supply and demand which have given rise to proposals for such a scheme, before itendorses the formal introduction of any arrangements involvingquantitative regulation, other than the introduction of provisionalexport quotas.(3) Specific provision must be made in connection with any scheme involvingquantitative restriction which is approved by the General Executivefor insuring that there are increasing opportunities (which should beapplied as far as possible during the period of the scheme) for supplying world requirements from countries able to furnish such requirements most effectively, with appropriate adjustments in prices to changes in the basic conditions of production and demand, and for measures designed to facilitate any adjustments in production whichmay be requisite to this end.(4) No quantitative regulation scheme should be approved for a period ofmore than five years. No such scheme should be renewed except uponendorsement by the General Executive following the consideration bythat body of a report (which should be published) showing how far thepreceding principles, and in particular those at (3) above, had been observed during the initial period of operation of the scheme.IV. Subsidies.1. The United States group have drawn attention to the importance ofinsuring that the attainment of one of the basic objectives of international commodity policy a state of affairs under which there would be increasingopportunities for supplying world requirements from countries in a position tosupply such requirements most effectively should not be jeopardised by any widespread use of subsidies to maintain or extend production which can beregarded e,x hypothesi as less effective than that of countries where no subsidy is needed. They have pointed out that not only would the widespread use of subsidies tenet to diminish (as in the inter-war period) the &quot; free market&quot; areaavailable to the more effective producers, but that the successful operation of abuffer stocks scheme would be likely to be threatened if countries were able to throw on to the market subsidised commodities in substantial quantities.Accordingly, they would wish to secure agreement that countries (whetherexporting of deficit areas) which find it necessary to resort to subsidies should inall cases link the grant of such subsidies with a quantitative limitation on the[26480] h
amount of subsidised production, e.g., to insure that it would not, in any event,exceed the average production during a base period, and that there should, if practicable, be an undertaking progressively to reduce the amount of subsidisedproduction below the base period level. Unless a general formula can be found,the alternative would appear to be to deal with the problem of subsidy on thebasis of individual commodities. This latter approach might well involve inrespect of individual commodities greater recourse to quantitative regulation than is envisaged by the United Kingdom group.2. The United Kingdom group recognise the force of the considerationsput forward by the United States group. They agree that in cases where itis necessary to resort to subsidies these should be moderate in amount. But theyare not able to accept the conclusion that there ought to be international agreementstipulating that subsidies should in all cases be accompanied, by a quantitativelimitation on the amount of subsidised production. Such a proposal would, intheir view, cause serious political difficulties, especially in those countries which,under other proposals now under consideration, would be asked to renounce other measures (high tariffs, quantitative import restrictions except under certain conditions) on which they may have largely clejjended in the past for the pro-tection of their industries, especially agrarian industries, and which would belikely, if maintained, to be much more detrimental to the &quot; free market &quot; than would, the continuance of moderate subsidies; Moreover, the United Kingdomgroup are hopeful that it would be found that in practice pressure from taxpayerswould in nearly every case insure that the payment of subsidies was made condi-tional upon a quantitative limitation on production.3. It is agreed between the two groups that further consideration should begiven to the question of insuring that subsidisation is kept within moderate limits and, in particular, to the question of setting a limit to the subsidisation of theproduction of goods of which world surpluses exist. .  .V. Further Action.It is recommended that arrangements should be made for further informal discussions between representatives of the United States arid United kingdom governments within three or four months, in order to ascertain how far therecommendations for international action implicit in the foregoing paragraphsare acceptable to both Governments and to consider how such recommendationscan best be discussed with the other United. Nations concerned at an early date with a view to the initiation of plans for the establishment of the international organisations contemplated and for the study, on an international basis, of certain important commodities in respect of which difficult problems are likely to arise in the post-war period.
CARTEL POLICY.Covering Report.1. The United Kingdom group had no special instructions on cartel policy,and included no one who had made a special study of the questions involved. TheUnited States group, which had proposed that this subject should be among thosediscussed, included several individuals of great ability from the Department ofJustice, who were thoroughly acquainted with the details of individual carteloperations, largely based on enquiries made of United States companies with international affiliations.2.   From an early stage in the discussions two things were manifest: (a) The different legal and political background in the United States andthe United Kingdom in the matter of cartel policy; and(b) The emphasis which the United States group placed upon the need for action in the field of international cartel activity as an indispensablecorollary to that which it was envisaged Government would take inthe fields of commercial and commodity policy.3. As regards (a), practically nothing now remains in the United Kingdomof the old common law presumption against restraint of trade, while there is awell-marked trend of opinion in favour of &quot; self-government &apos;*&apos; in industry andof understandings between British and foreign groups. Moreover, there has been considerable criticism to the effect that British industry was organised inuneconomically small units, and there has therefore been a tendency on the partboth of Government and of the public to look without hostility and sometimeswith favour on measures which promoted industrial integration. To a consider -able extent this move towards integration has been encouraged by the measuresof control which have been found necessary during the war and the executionof which was greatly facilitated by the close association of the units within a given industry.4. In the United States, on the other hand, there is a history of anti-trustlegislation going back for a large number of years, and during the early partof this period the public was much incensed by the operations of industrialmonopolies. Consequently, there has always been a considerable body of publicopinion in the United States in favour of strong action against monopolisticpractices and a section of the Department of Justice which is devoted to the prosecution of those who engage in them. Although for a long time it was thought that the big Corporations had discovered successful methods of evasion,it is claimed that anti-trust action had achieved a number of successes in theperiod before the United States entry into the war. Moreover, anti-trust action has the support of sufficient members of Congress to ensure the continuance ofthe activities of the special section of the Department of Justice, since manyof the members of Congress regard themselves as the defenders not only of freeenterprise but of the small business men against the large Corporation.A further impetus in the direction, of action against cartels is likely to begiven by the fact that, in the course of its most recent investigations, theDepartment of Justice has obtained a good deal of material which tends to showthat the big German cartels had used their understandings with large american and British Corporations for purposes of industrial and, indeed, militaryespionage, and for holding back the exploitation of new inventions and processes of military value in the United States and probably also the United Kingdom.5. Given this background, the United Kingdom group formed a very definiteimpression that some sections of United States official opinion felt very&quot; stronglyindeed about the activities of cartels, both national and international, that those sections had sufficient support from Congress and public opinion (and wouldprobably retain such support even upon a change of Administration) to be able topress their views on other Governments, and that, consequently, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment must be prepared for further pressure on this subject. Indeed, it isdifficult to find an answer to the argument that logically His Majesty?s Govern-ment should be prepared to examine means of ensuring that restrictive practicesare not introduced by international arrangement between manufacturing interests which would be contrary to the general policy of removing or lowering barriers tothe freest possible exchange of goods and services. In particular, any indication that His Majesty&apos;s Government was reluctant to enter upon further discussionsconcerning cartel activities in the international field would almost certainly[26480] h 2
prejudice further discussions in the field of commercial and commodity policy,since the United States representatives would suspect that we were strongly opposed to restrictive practices in respect of the raw material and food importson which the United Kingdom depends, but were very ready to condone suchpractices in the case of manufactures which the United Kingdom exports. Inthe discussions on commodity policy, it was agreed that States participating in the proposed International Commodity Organisation ought to agree that norestrictive arrangements should be entered into in the case of primary productsunless such arrangements were communicated for scrutiny and report to theInternational Organisation. Given the United Kingdom endorsement of this Jproposal in the field of commodity policy (which actually is less drastic than thearrangement contemplated in paragraph&quot; 10 (ii) of the memorandum on &quot;TheInternational Regulation of Primary Products &quot; (R.P. (43) 12)), it would appeardifficult to resist proposals from the United States group at least for the registration of international agreements in the industrial field with someinternational body similar to the International Commodity Organisation.6. Actually the proposals of the United States group, which are indicatedin paragraphs 3-5 of the relevant section of the &apos;&apos; Agreed Statement&apos;&apos; resultingfrom the Washington discussions (see Annexure), go considerably beyond the registration of agreements with an international body. They envisage ratherco-operation between the United Kingdom and the United States in a campaign of &quot; international trust-busting.&quot; While the United- States group recognisedduring the discussions that it might be difficult to secure the adherence of a largenumber of countries to a convention prohibiting the practices set out in para-graph II 1 (b) of the Annexure, they urged that a good start would be made ifthe United Kingdom would collaborate with the United States in enforcing suchprohibitions so far as United Kingdom and United States nationals were concerned, while they also urged that prohibitions of the kind indicated couldbe imposed upon Germany as one of the conditions of the peace treaty.7. /The United Kingdom group confined themselves during-the discussionseither to personal statements or to attempts to elucidate the American position.It was pointed out that many of the practices of monopolies would also be carriedout in the interests of efficiency by industrial organisations which, for technical reasons, had become large enough to dominate the market, and that there were a number of conditions (e.g., in declining industries) in which Government might consider it desirable to modify fully competitive practices. It was also urgedthat the prohibitions desired by the United States group would probably beundiscriminating instruments which would strike at good as well as at the badpractices; that many countries might adopt rigid prohibitions but would lackthe will or the means to enforce them; and that it was the spirit in which largeCorporations might use their power, rather than the power itself, which wasobjectionable. In short, the view was advanced that any rigid list of prohibitionswhich would be unable to discriminate between varying circumstances in different countries, would be open to serious objection and might actually be a cause ofinternational friction if widely different interpretations were placed by theCourts of different countries on what were ostensibly similar laws. It appeared that in practice the United States Department of Justice did hot depend in theinternal field on specific prohibitions nearly as much as on a general prohibition on actions in restraint of trade, and that this power was exercised in a somewhatarbitrary manner against those activities which appeared to the Department ofJustice to be particularly harmful.8. There is thus considerable reason to doubt whether the more far-reachingproposals put forward by the United States group would in fact either be in thepublic interest or be practicable, especially in so far as they would necessarily depend for their enforcement on action by individual Governments andjudiciaries. It may well be considered that the United Kingdom ought not to go beyond agreement to co-operate in the investigation and registration of inter-national cartel arrangements. But, quite apart from what may be called the tactical difficulty of withstanding pressure from the United States group, thereis the consideration that during the discussions the United States representativesproduced many instances of actual practices in the international field which appeared prima facie to be clearly against the public interest. This was particu-larly striking in the case of agreements not to exploit patents except with the permission of all the various parties to the agreements, and a good deal of evidence was produced pointing to the danger that scientific developments might be held up either in the interests of the fixed capital assets constructed to use processeswhich would be rendered obsolete by new developments, or even to keep newproducts off the market because there was more profit in the old ones.
9.   It thus appears essential that &apos;(i) before any further discussions are entered upon with the United states representatives Ministers should reach at any rate provisional con-clusions about the broad lines of policy which it would be desirable tofollow in the cartel field, particularly in its international aspect; and(ii) in order to facilitate the formulation of that policy and in order that theUnited Kingdom representatives (who may have to discuss the subjectfurther with United States officials) may be equipped with as muchknowledge as is at present possible of the operation of cartels, further detailed study should be given to the whole question by some sectionof the Board of Trade especially charged with this task.The United States group have urged that bodies of experts should be estab-lished both in London and in Washington for the exchange of ideas and information on this subject. It is clearly necessary both that further study shouldbe given to the problem by the Board of Trade and that Ministers should reachprovisional conclusions about the broad lines of policy before any agreement ismade providing for detailed study and co-operation with United States repre-sentatives, since such an agreement might have embarrassing results if it wereimplemented without full consideration of what might be involved.10.   The position may be summed up as follows : &apos;(i) The United States Administration have a strong and well-defined policy,and appear to be determined to lose no opportunity of pressing thisupon the United Kingdom.(ii) The United States group produced a number of instances in which theactivities of international cartels appeared to be prima facie againstthe public interest. .(iii) A refusal to enter upon further discussions on the activities of inter-national cartels would almost certainly prejudice further discussions on commercial and commodity policy.(iv) It is necessary, before any further discussions are undertaken with theUnited Stales group, that guidance on the general policy issues involved should be given by Ministers,(v) In order to facilitate the formulation of policy and to place ourselves in a better position to talk with the United States experts, the Boardof Trade should be charged with the duty of making a studv of thewhole matter from the United Kingdom standpoint.8th November, 1943.Annex.Agreed Anglo-American Document on Private International BusinessA agreements.I. General Considerations.1. Consideration has been given by the United States and United Kingdomgroups, in a series of discussions, to the question of whether in conformity withother measures under consideration for the removal of restrictions upon produc-tion and international trade, action in the international sphere should be under-taken to deal with problems which may arise from the activities of internationalcartels.The United Kingdom group have welcomed the opportunity of participating in these discussions. They have, however, found it necessary to explain thatproblems arising from the activities of international cartels have not hitherto been made the subject of detailed study by the United Kingdom Government andthat they were necessarily less well prepared than the United States group todiscuss the subject.2. The two groups are agreed that further discussions in pursuance ofArticle VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement should properly comprise inter alia, an examination of problems which are likely to arise as a result of the activities ofinternational cartels, and of measures national or international appropriate tothese problems.3. The United States group have urged that; in the absence of special measures of international regulation, cartels would be likely to take action in
the international field inconsistent with a liberal commercial policy and with article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement in that they would, inter alia, tendto thwart the beneficial effects of any reduction of barriers to trade imposed by governments, and would involve restrictions on production, productive capacity,and technological advance both directly and by practices e.g., the maintenanceof a minimum price system which would diminish potential consumption ofthe products of industry. They have also laid much stress on the fact that the policies and activities of international cartels may be frequently inimical to national security for the following reasons among others :-*(a) The restriction of the development of strategic industries required formilitary security.(b) The transfer of military secrets both in time of peace and in time ofwar.(c) The commingling of trade penetration and political propaganda.(d) Defeat of wartime measures for the prohibition of trade with the enemy,and for control and disposition of enemy property.II.&apos; Outline for Further Study.1. In the light of the foregoing considerations, the United States grouppropose that further consideration should be given to measures on the following lines : (a) Registration of all private international agreements which establishenduring relationships between business enterprises, including thosewhich involve the acquisition of ownership interests by one enterprisein another; and measures to make the registered information availableto the participating Governments and to any appropriate international body or bodies.(&amp;) Prohibition by international agreement of objectionable-international&apos; cartel activities. In particular it is suggested that the followingpractices should be considered with a view to their prohibition : -(1) Agreements for fixing prices.(2) Agreements to allocate territorial markets;(3) Agreements for the restriction of production;(4) Agreements for the restriction of exports;(5) Agreements for the restriction of productive capacity;(6) Agreements to restrict the exploitation of inventions;(7) Agreements not to supply or to deal with non-cartel members;(8) Agreements providing for differential prices;(9) Agreements not registered in accordance with the proposals for registration set forth in paragraph II, 1 (a) above.(c) Reduction of the dangers resulting from international cartelisation bymeans of international conventions and national legislation concerningcorporation, patent and trade-mark law, and other relevant commercial matters.2. The United States group have suggested that as the above subjectsinvolve highly technical considerations the most convenient procedure would befor them to be studied preparatory to discussions pursuant to Article VII by working groups of experts from both Governments in both London and washington.III. Need for International Approach.1. Both groups appreciate the importance of the problems indicated in theforegoing paragraphs. They are agreed that the pursuit of widely divergentcommercial policies in any field, including that of international cartel policy,would be a matter for regret. The United Kingdom group have undertaken tomake known to their Government the emphasis which the United States grouphave placed on the desirability of further detailed studies in this field on ajoint basis, and to recommend that sympathetic consideration should be givenby the United Kingdom Government to such a proposal.2. The United Kingdom group recognise that highly complicated andtechnical issues are involved in studies in this field, and that if it is decidedthat there should be further consideration of the problems on a joint basis, special arrangements will be required to insure the most effective collaboration of expertson both sides.!
. V.EMPLOYMENT POLICY.Agreed Anglo-American Document on  International  Co-ordination  of measures for the Maintenance of High Levels of Employment.I-Specialised International Economic Organisations.1. Attention has been given to the question whether there shall be institutedan international organisation; specifically charged with the duty of promotingand co-ordinating policies designed to maintain high levels of employmentthroughout the world, and more generally with the study of complex economic problems of an international character.2. The maintenance of high levels of employment must necessarily be theresult of the influence of a complex of policies. Some of these will be of a domesticnature and will vary according.to the circumsta,nces of the particular national economy concerned. Some, however, will be policies pursued by the international agencies now in contemplation or under discussion. There will also be mattersof international concern not covered by any specific agency.3. It is hoped that four new international institutions may ultimatelyemerge as a result of informal economic discussions : *(a) An international stabilisation fund for currencies.(b) An international investment bank.(c) An international commodity organisation.(of) An international commercial policy organisation.Each of these bodies will, if it comes into existence, exert a profound influence on economic conditions throughout the world, and in particular on the employment situation.4. To the four bodies mentioned above there should be added the Inter-national Labour Organisation and the Projected Permanent Organisation on food and Agriculture of which the activities are also within the same range ofinterest, also perhaps temporary agencies such as United Nations Relief and rehabilitation Administration.II. Co-ordination of Specialised International Economic Organisations.1. Clearly the policies pursued by these different bodies should be soco-ordinated as to avoid overlap, or inconsistency; and since the maintenanceof employment will not be the only objective of any of them, or the only objective of purely domestic policies, it is desirable that there should exist someorganisation with wider terms of reference. It follows, therefore, that the function of promoting international action designed to maintain high levels ofemployment should be discharged by a body concerned also with the co-ordinationof economic policies generally, rather than that there should be set up an institution charged only with problems of employment.2. It is suggested that an Advisory Economic Staff should be established asthe nucleus and operative section of such an organisation, headed by a Director of authority and influence. It will be necessary to the success of such an organisation that the permanent staff should have high technical qualifications and shouldcollaborate closely with the staffs of other economic international organisations.Experience in the inter-war period shows that the prospects of success of aninternational body very largely depend upon the recruitment of high qualitypersonnel under authoritative and influential leadership.3. The scope of such a staff would include much more than the maintenanceof high levels of employment. But it might well regard the latter as among themost important of the criteria by which it would judge particular policies. Itshould, moreover, provide facilities for consultation with a view to theco-ordination of domestic employment policies and for the education of publicopinion regarding the forms which such policies might fruitfully take. Inparticular, it would be its duty to distinguish clearly between those policies which
are serviceable to other countries as well as to itself, and those which are of sucha character that they amount, in a useful phrase, to the &quot; export of itsunemployment.&apos;&apos;4. It is difficult at this stage to determine the exact form of the repre-sentative governing body to which the Advisory Economic Staff should beresponsible. Much depends upon the future evolution of other forms of politicaland economic co-operation. The governing body might well consist of members appointed by the institutions mentioned in paragraphs 3 and 4 above (thusintroducing the representative element), under an independent chairman andwith the addition of co-opted members. On the other hand, if some internationalpolitical organisation is set up, it might prove desirable that this organisation should have an economic wing to which the Advisory Economic Staff would beresponsible and where matters of general international economic policy mightbe sifted and debated before being submitted for ultimate political decision. in either event, it will be essential that the Advisory Economic Staff should be closely associated with the institutions charged with more executive functions and should not be put in the position of researching in vacuo.5. The functions and organisation of the future Advisory Economic Staffmight be usefully studied before the time is ripe to determine the character ofthe governing body to which it should be attached.
