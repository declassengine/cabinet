In this memorandum I am concerned only with the furtherproposal that there should be, in addition to these restrictions, a visitors&apos; ban overthe whole of the south and east coasts from the Wash to Penzance.It is important that we should be quite clear as to what is meant by a visitors&apos;ban. It is not a ban on all visitors to the -area to which it applies. It is merely a prohibition on entry into those areas for the purpose of a holiday, recreation orpleasure, or as a casual wayfarer. Persons who have other good reasons for entry,such as business, visits to near relatives, &amp;c, are not prohibited by the ban. Theban has hitherto applied to the coastal area from King&apos;s Lynn to Littlehampton,and the Isle of Wight, but has been lifted, over the winter months and until the1st April, over all this area except the coastal strip from the Thames to Rye.The proposals in the War Office memorandum are that the ban should&apos; bereimposed over the areas to which it has hitherto been applied with the&apos; additionof an area about 10 miles deep inland, and also over an area of correspondingdepth extending from Littlehampton to Penzance.When this matter was considered by the Cabinet last February I dealt fully,in a memorandum by myself and the Minister of Health (W,P. (43) 74), with thearguments then adduced by the military for the reimposition of the ban uponthe areas to which, it applied last summer, and I submitted to the War Cabinetour conclusion that, the invasion risk, which was the reason for the impositionof the ban, having diminished, no case for its reimposition had been made out.In discussion at the War Cabinet, it was pointed out that, from a security pointof view, it might be more effective to have a more strict control over entry, butapplied over a smaller area than that covered by the previous restrictions^ andthe War Cabinet invited the War Office to formulate and to discuss with theCivil Departments concerned new proposals for restrictions designed to safe-guard our preparations for offensive operations. It will be observed that, farfrom applying over a smaller area, it is proposed that the visitors&apos; ban. should beapplied over a greatly extended area, covering the whole of the south and muchof the east coast.[25196]
The arguments which the War Office now advance for this proposal fallxmder two heads : (i) The security of our offensive operations; and(ii) The necessity of &quot; cover &quot; as part of our general strategic plan, which requires that restrictions shall appear to be as strict as possible, andshall apply to so wide an area that the enemy will not be able to identify the probable places of departure or the destination of ourexpeditionary force.1. Security.I need not deal at any great length with the arguments based upon security,and I would merely refer to the statement on this point made in paragraph 8 (c)of my previous memorandum. A ban which purports to keep out only one kindof visitor while admitting many others, and which is enforceable only byoccasional challenge of individuals by the police as to their reasons for being in aparticular area, is clearly of negligible advantage from the security point of view.In the War Office memorandum it is admitted that the contribution to securitywould be small, but it is stated that we cannot afford to neglect any contributionto the improvement of our chances of surprise. As against this statement I would point out that at the meeting of the Security Executive at which these proposals were discussed on the 19th March, the representative of the Security Servicesadmitted that the security to be obtained from the visitors&apos; ban was trifling.Restrictions ought not to be imposed for security purposes unless there is some definite advantage to be gained from the security point of view which outweighsthe general objection to restrictions. It is a cardinal principle of security that security efforts should not be dissipated but should be concentrated on those measures which are likely to yield the most positive results and will be accepted as necessary by public opinion. I submit that, having regard to the large area from which it is proposed that a limited class of visitors are to be excluded andthe hardship and inconvenience that would be involved, there is no case whateverfor the imposition of the visitors&apos; ban as a security measure.In paragraph 9 (c) of the War Office memorandum and again inparagraph 9 (e) there is a suggestion that it is necessary to keep the civil popula-tion in the coastal belt small in order to secure smooth working of militaryarrangements. If the argument for this is the security argument I would pointout that the necessary journeys in and out of the area of residents, of people whowould not be excluded by the ban, and of soldiers on leave, &amp;c, is such that thepresence of casual visitors in a few coastal towns or other places can make no appreciable difference from the point of view of security, apart from the fact,which I have pointed out in my previous memorandum, that the casual visitoris far less dangerous from the security point of view than the resident who hasboth opportunity for observation and the knowledge which enables him to drawdeductions from his observation.If, on the other hand, it is alleged that the presence of casual visitors willactually offer a physical impediment to military operations, I know of no founda-tion for.such a contention. Road traffic is now so reduced that there is no difficultyin keeping roads clear for military purposes; accommodation for troops can beobtained, or requisitioned, by the military at any places where they want it; andspectators, whether visitors or residents, can be kept away from particular pointsby the exercise of the powers which it is proposed to take within the RegulatedAreas. The removal of the ban need not and, indeed, ought not to lead to theprovision of increased transport facilities to the coastal areas, though, no doubt,increased use would be made of the facilities normally available.2. Cover for our Offensive Operations.The War Office memorandum states that the Germans will not regard our proposals as seriously intended if their most advertised feature is the removalof the visitors&apos; ban.I cannot agree that this is a correct view either of the effect of the proposals on the Germans or of the way in which they would be advertised. In view of the statements which have already been made by the Prime Minister, president roosevelt and others about our intentions, and the announcement, which I assumewould be made, that restrictions under the regulated area powers may be appliedwithout further notice at any points within the whole area^involved, the germans are unlikely to conclude that we are not in earnest merely because the special restrictions on certain types of visitors on a certain part of the coast, which
were imposed for anti-invasion purposes are not being reimposed. Indeed, fromthe point of view of convincing the enemy that we are in earnest, surely it is preferable to say plainly on the wifeless and. in the Press that this country is nowshifting over to the offensive; that the whole system of restrictions on the coast,which was designed for anti-invasion purposes, has been re-cast and, in substitution for previous restrictions, a very much enlarged and extended areaof the coast will now come under the restrictions applicable in a regulated area,within which access to various places at various times may be completelyprohibited; that people ought not, therefore, to enter this area except for good reason; and that they must expect, if they do enter, to encounter restrictions atplaces and times which cannot be specified.The War Office suggests that visitors would, in fact, feel aggrieved if theyset out for a seaside destination only to find that it had been placed &quot; out ofbounds.&quot; This argument entirely overlooks the fact that people who are entitled,so far as the Visitors&apos; Ban is concerned, to enter these areas for instance,commercial travellers or persons going to see near relatives would in any event be exposed to the same uncertainty, and would have even more reason to feelaggrieved. I have no doubt, however, that if the restrictions were applicablewithout distinction to all classes of the community they would accept the uncertainty involved as a necessary consequence of the development of ouroffensive plans.A further argument against the reimposition of the visitors&apos; ban in additionto the restrictions appropriate to a Regulated Area is that people will quicklydiscover that, though they may not go into Brighton, or Torquay, for pleasure,many persons go in and out of these places for other purposes every day. if nothing of military importance is happening at these particular places, this will soon become known. This may lead the public not only to regard the ban onvisitors as a mere piece of bluff, but to suspect that the object of this bluff is to conceal the fact that no preparations are going on at all; in other words, farfrom being convinced that we are in earnest, the public may come to the oppositeconclusion. If, on the other hand, the coastal area is declared to be a regulatedarea without the imposition of a special ban on pleasure visitors, this difficultywill not arise, since everybody will understand that the mere fact that access to,say, Brighton, is permitted for the time being does not imply that importantpreparations are not going on in other parts of the coast.As regards the argument thj,at there will be an increased use of transport,there is no reason why any extra transport facilities should be provided by theMinistry of War Transport and the public would fully understand and accept this. jI have already expressed the view that a restriction such as the Visitors&apos;Ban bearing hardly not only upon the ordinary public and those who cater for persons at holiday resorts, but also upon invalids and those sent to the coast ondoctors&apos; orders, ought not to be reimposed, still less extended, unless there arestrong overriding arguments in its favour. My conclusion is that no sucharguments have been adduced, and that the creation of a Regulated Area all along the coast will effect all that the War Office wish to secure, without thisirksome, unnecessary and unenforceable restriction. I would add that theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has informed me that at the SecurityExecutive Meeting, at which these proposals were considered, the general feeling of the meeting was that the case for the reimposition of the ban over a much-extended stretch of territory had not been made out.H.
