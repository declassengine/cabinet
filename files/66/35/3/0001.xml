THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  March 1943.SECRET.Copy No. 2/W.P. (i3) 103.March 10, 1943WAR CABINET.POST-WAR AGRICULTURAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Minister without Portfolio.ON behalf of the Committee on Reconstruction Problems I submit, for theconsideration of the War Cabinet, a memorandum on post-war agricultural policywhich has been prepared by the Agricultural Departments and discussed jointlyby the Official Committees on Internal and External Economic Problems;The memorandum, besides having the backing of the Secretary of State forScotland and the Minister of Agriculture, was unanimously approved by theOfficial Committees as a basis for exploratory and non-committal discussions with agricultural interests in this country and with the Dominion Governments, onthe clear understanding that these discussions were to be conducted in such a way as not to prejudice any conclusions which might ultimately be reached underArticle-VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement.2. The memorandum starts from the fact that the Government, and all themain political parties, are committed to the policy of maintaining &quot; a healthyand well-balanced agriculture as an essential and permanent feature of national policy,&quot; and it proceeds to consider (i) what should be the nature and extent of a healthy and well-balanceddomestic agriculture in this country, and(ii) by what methods such a domestic agriculture can be maintained.8. The memorandum indicates the way in which the bulk of our agricultural land, can be used to produce food while maintaining its fertility. production would show a moderate increase over pre-war such as would probably involve adecrease of imports of food and feeding stuffs by about 10 per cent, comparedwith pre-war-a decrease which may in any case be necessary if we are to maintain our balance of payments. It is recognised that the precise methods for main-taining domestic agriculture of the character and on the scale proposed will haveto be consistent with post-war international arrangements. It suggests measuresof control designed to ensure efficient standards of management and farming, andrefers to the problem of avoiding the risk of excessive profits accruing to individuals under a system-designed to give economic stability to the industry as a whole.4. It is not possible to give a definite estimate of the cost, if any, of theproposed policy. We do not know what we shall have to pay for food from overseas, or how much our agriculture has improved its efficiency during the warrelatively to that of exporting countries, or what the. effect of nutritional policieswill be, or what economies can be effected in distribution. A Committee of repre-sentatives of the Treasury, the Ministries of Agriculture and Food and the central statistical Office made a very tentative guess that the cost to the Exchequer on certain assumptions as to prices, &amp;c, of fitting the policy into the general frame-work of the stabilisation policy would.amount in subsidies to a sum of the order[25141]
of  50 millions per annum. There would also be a loss on imported foods arisingfrom the stabilisation policy which would be of the order of  36 millions perannum.5. The Committee on Reconstruction Problems agreed generally (thoughthe Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Labour and National Service and theSecretary to the Department of Overseas Trade wished their dissent from theconclusions        whole to be recorded) (1) That the proposals should be brought before the War Cabinet, alldecisions of principle or on detail being reserved, the proposals being put forward merely as a general picture.(2) That the War Cabinet should be invited to authorise discussions on theselines with agricultural interests in this country, and. in due coursealso with the Dominions and India, on the clear understanding thatno financial commitments could at present be given or implied and that other features in the proposals were contingent on the discussions with the Dominion and United States Governments.(3) That the Ministry of Food should be invited, in collaboration with theAgricultural Departments, to go into the questions raised in theproposals of promoting increased efficiency in marketing, processing,and distribution to supplement increased efficiency in production, andto submit suggestions in due course for consideration by the official committee.W.

SECRET.POST-WAR AGRICULTURAL POLICY.Memorandum by A agricultural Departments.Introductory.ON the 26th November, 1940, the Government announced that it had decidedto guarantee that the present system of fixed prices and an assured market foragricultural products would be maintained for the duration of hostilities and for at least one year thereafter. The announcement went on to say : &quot; The Govern-ment, representative as it is of all major political parties, recognises theimportance of maintaining after the war a healthy and well-balanced agricultureas an essential and permanent feature of national policy. The guarantee now givenis meant to secure that stability shall be maintained not only during hostilities but during a length of time thereafter sufficient to put into action a permanent post-war policy for home agriculture.&quot;2. The continuation of the present system of fixed prices and an assuredmarket will involve as a corollary the retention of the present system of controlover the use of agricultural land and over farming operations. When hostilitiescease there is likely to be a transitional period the character of which it isimpossible to predict, and for a time many features of the war situation maypersist. During this period it may prove necessary to continue, in part at least,the present war-time programme of production. When, however, hostilitiescease it would be impossible to maintain the present very drastic war-timesystem of direction and control which would be required for a continuance ofwar-time production, without announcing what long-term agricultural policyis going to be. Moreover, on the cessation of hostilities a number of urgentquestions will arise in connection with the programme during the transitional period, e.g., when and at what rate and to what extent and by what means thewar-time acreage of wheat is to be reduced, the answers to which will depend upon long-term policy.3. It has been laid down by Ministers that for the purpose of formulatingthe lines of a permanent post-war policy for agriculture, the following principles should be provisionally accepted : (i) That all reasonably good agricultural land should be maintained in astate, of fertility and productivity,(ii) That we should desire to adopt a policy to secure to the utmost practicableextent: (a) proper standards of upkeep of the farm and buildings;(b) proper standards of farming; and(c) measures for the economic stability of the industry.4. The purpose of this memorandum is to set out the considerations which arise in connection with long-term agricultural policy and on the basis of theprinciples laid down in the preceding paragraph to put forward positive proposalsfor &quot; maintaining after the war a healthy and well-balanced agriculture as anessential and permanent feature of national policy&quot; with as little interferenceas possible with other aspects of national economic policy and with due regardto what appear to be the probable trends of social policy.In this connection it has been found necessary to make the following assumptions : (a) The Governments statement of November 1940 has generally been takento mean that the Government intend as an act of policy to promote,measures under which agriculture would occupy a more importantplace in the national life and economy than it did before the war. Onthe other hand, it is assumed that it will be unnecessary and undesir-able to aim at an increase in domestic agricultural production of ahigher order of magnitude than that contemplated in the Treasury[24091]   [24859]
aMemorandum on External Monetary and Economic Policy. that memorandum appears to contemplate an increase compared with pre-war of something like  60 millions at assumed post-war prices or say 40 millions at pre-war levels.(&amp;) There will be a larger measure of Governmental control than existed before the war, both in the sphere of international trade and over theinternal economic life of this country.(c) High rates of direct taxation will continue after the war, and for this and other reasons a number of owners of agricultural estates, bothlarge and small, will be unable to maintain them, and action by theState may in certain cases become urgently necessary.5. On the basis of the provisional principles laid down by Ministers and onthe assumptions in the preceding paragraph, the problems of post-war agricul-tural policy can conveniently be considered under four heads : I. The General Objective.II. Economic Stability.III. Land Utilisation.IV. Promotion of Efficiency in Production and Marketing.To some extent, of course, these sets of problems are interlocked : land utilisation,economic conditions and farming efficiency react upon one another. They can,however, be most conveniently examined in separate groups provided that it is realised that one set of problems cannot be satisfactorily tackled without attentionbeing paid to the others.I. The General Objective.6. The general character of the main objective is indicated in the first of theprinciples provisionally laid down by Ministers, namely, that all reasonably goodagriculturahland should be maintained in a state of fertility and productivity.In considering what is involved in this principle, the following questions arise :What does &apos;&apos; all reasonably good agricultural land &apos;&apos; connote ?. What would bethe character of British agriculture, i.e., what types or systems of farming wouldbe appropriate for keeping all reasonably good agricultural land in a state offertility and productivity? What would be the amount and character of the resulting production, having regard to the probable trend of public demand asinfluenced by social policy and to the fact that we shall continue to import alarge proportion of the agricultural products we require ? Lastly, what measures would be required and what would it cost to maintain all reasonably good agricul-tural land in a state of fertility and productivity under appropriate and efficientsystems of farming ?7.   What does &apos;&apos; all reasonably good agricultural land &apos;&apos; connote ?Before the war the agricultural land of the United Kingdom comprised48,285,585 acres, consisting of : England and Northern- Wales. Scotland. Ireland. Total.Cultivated land  Acres. Acres. Acres. Acres.Arable       ...      ...      8,934,598      2,935,487      1,036,045      12,906,130Permanent grass  ...     15,708,663      1,622,724      1,441,581      18,772,96824,643,261      4,558,211 . 2,477,626      31,679,098Rough grazings (Mainly      mountainand hill land)    ...      5,607,912 10,465,016 533,559      16,606,487Totals... 30,251,173    15,023,227      3,011,185      48,285,585This country is remarkable for a great variety and inter-mixture of soils.This fact taken in conjunction with the wide difference in rainfall in the eastern and western parts of the country and our uncertain weather has led to a greatdiversity of types or systems of farming producing a wide range of food and other products. It should be noted that these systems were developed or maintained during the period of 60 years of international free trade after British agriculturewas subjected to the full force of competition from overseas countries in the1870&apos;s.  There is a prima facie presumption, therefore, that, based as they are in
the main on geophysical factors, these types of farming are those which are,most appropriate for an agriculture which does not have to aim at &quot;self-sufficiency, but is complementary to an economic system which relies on a large importation ofagricultural products. In any case it can be said that different kinds of landcan be and are used for different purposes, and land which is not &quot; reasonably good &quot; for one form of production may be very suitable for another.8. It should also be noted that the different uses to which different types ofland may be put and the different systems of farming that prevail throughoutthe country are to a large extent interdependent and interlocked. The grass thatgrows on the mountain or hill farms of Scotland, Wales and Northern ireland is very suitable for the rearing of cattle and- sheep, but it is not good for milk production, and it will not fatten cattle or sheep. The grass that grows on thesoils of Cheshire is very good for milk production. The grass on the strongpastures of the Midlands is unsuitable both for rearing young stock and for milk production, but is admirable for fattening mature cattle of certain breeds.Consequently,. Welsh hill farms are appropriately used for producing youngheifers for the dairy farms in Cheshire or beef stores for fattening on theMidland pastures, and hill sheep farms all over Great Britain are producinglambs to be fattened on lowland pastures or on arable farms. Thus fertilelowland farms and poor hill farms depend on each other. Many other illustra-tions could be given to.show the interdependence of varied uses of different kinds of soils and the advantages that follow from it. )9. It is, suggested, therefore, that if &quot;all reasonably good agricultural land &quot; is to be maintained in a state of fertility and productivity the great bulkof the land which was being used for agriculture before the war should be. spmaintained. Some agricultural land will of course be required for industry,building and other forms of non-agricultural use, and there are considerable areasof land mainly rough hill and mountain grazings- which could, if necessary,and perhaps with advantage, be devoted to afforestation. But an agricultural policy designed to maintain a healthy and well-balanced agriculture in thiscountry could hardly be regarded as satisfactorily fulfilling its objective if itresulted in any districts in which agriculture had been carried on during theperiod of free international competition becoming unproductive or infertile orstill further depopulated. What would appear to be desirable and necessarywould be a policy directed to maintain the bulk of the agricultural land of thiscountry in appropriate productive use and fertility, while stopping, though itmay not be possible to reverse, the tendency for the drift of the agricultural population from the land.10. What would be appropriate productive use, i.e,, what should be thegeneral character of British agriculture, and what systems of farming arerequired to maintain our agricultural land in productivity and fertility?It has been suggested in some quarters that with the development ofmechanisation which has taken place in recent years and been greatly extendedduring the war, it would be possible by the establishment of large farm units to restore arable farming to the position it occupied in the 1870&apos;s, when both cashcrops like wheat and arable fodder crops for livestock occupied in the midlands and other parts of England the same place that they occupied before the war inthe eastern counties. It is true that the development of mechanisation has led toa marked improvement in efficiency and has revolutionised what can be done inour uncertain climate, particularly on heavy clay soils. It is also true that tomake full economic use of modern machinery larger farming units are required.Having regard, however, to the climatic conditions which exist in the midlands,west and north of the country, a system of agriculture in those areaspredominantly devoted to the large-scale growing of cereal crops would notappear to be making the most appropriate use of the land. &apos; It is only in districts of low rainfall or where the soil is especially suitable for arable cultivation that large-scale mechanised farming would be suitable.11. Another school of thought has suggested that, in view of the importanceof protective perishable foods such as milk, vegetables, fruit,and eggs, this andother European countries should concentrate their agriculture &quot;on the productionof these particular commodities and rely on the overseas exporting countries for cereals and meat.    On this it may be said, first, that modern science is[24091] -     b 2
discovering new ways by which milk and vegetable and other foods can bedried and preserved and retain their nutritive value, and it would therefore be unwise to found an agricultural policy on the assumption that domesticagriculture in this and other countries will retain a natural monopoly ofperishable protective foods. Secondly, at a time of rapid scientific discovery and rapid changes in public demand, it would be dangerous to frame a long-termagricultural policy directed to producing a few special products. Any policyformulated to-day should be one which will provide the utmost possible flexibilityand adaptability to meet changing conditions. Thirdly, it would be impossibleunder an agricultural policy of this kind to maintain more than a small propor-tion of land in this or other European countries in productivity and fertility.Only a very small fraction of our agricultural land would be needed to produce the maximum amount of potatoes and vegetables required for an optimum dietfor the whole population. In our climate fruit is an uncertain crop in anyparticular year. While milk production can be extended yet, for the reasons givenin paragraph 13 below, the all-grass dairy farm largely relying on importedconcentrates is not a form of farming under which large areas of this country could in practice be maintained in productivity and fertility. Unless a wide range of products is produced, including a considerable acreage of cereals, andcrop production can be combined with grass production on ordinary as well as onexceptionally fertile land, the greater part of the agricultural land of this country(and of most European countries) would consist of deteriorating grassland usedfor dairy cows or for ranching cattle and sheep. This would mean not only a heavy decline in the agricultural population, but a calamitous decrease in thefertility of our land and in the knowledge of how to cultivate the land. Notonly would the absence of arable farming over a large part of the country renderus still more heavily dependent on foreign imported food and feeding-stuffs intime of peace, but we should be incapable of increasing production &quot;in time of war.12. The view of the best agricultural opinion, both scientific and practical,is that the only way of maintaining the greater part of our agricultural land,excluding rough grazings, in productivity and fertility is under varied systems of mixed farming varying by reference to the diversity and intermixture ofsoils, the difference in rainfall between east and west and other geophysicalfactors, and producing the wide range of food and other products which have been produced over the last 70 years. By reason of our soil and climate and for^economic reasons British agriculture should continue to be predominantly devotedto the production of livestock and livestock products over the greater part of thecountry. Grass has been, and should continue to be, our most important crop inthe west, north and midlands; and a large part of the arable acreage should con-tinue to produce crops for feeding to livestock rather than crops for direct human consumption. On land which is particularly suitable for arable cultivation or in&apos;those parts of the country where the rainfall is low, mixed farming systems shouldcontinue to be mainly devoted to cash crops like potatoes, wheat, malting barley,&amp;c, but in those systems, too, the production of livestock should generally continueto be an important item in the farm economy and the temporary grass or clover leyan essential part of the rotation. There is, of course, land which is particu-larly suitable for intensive horticultural production and market gardening andsome development of farms and holdings of this kind should be anticipated. Therewill also be farms or holdings which for one reason or another will remain allgrass. But over the greater part of the agricultural land of this country,excluding rough grazings, varied systems of mixed farming with appropriateproportions, varying by reference to geophysical factors, between grass and.arable, livestock and crops, are the best and indeed the only way to maintain our agricultural land in productivity and fertility.It is also believed that an agricultural policy directed to this end is one which,would, least interfere with other economic interests and would prove the mostadaptable to new scientific developments and changes in public demand (e.g.,increased demand for liquid milk) and in other economic circumstances.13. The need for systems of mixed, and balanced farming for maintainingsoil fertility and -the health of crops and livestock and the economic stability of farmers has been increasingly realised in this and other countries as a resultof experience in the inter-war period and since the outbreak of the present war.It is well known that the United States have in recent years directed their agricultural policy and devoted immense sums of money to establishing better
balanced systems of farming in their country under which soil conservation crops(e.g., leguminous crops) would be alternated with the growing of cereals, and livestock production would, be combined with crop production. The chiefsymptoms of the decay of agriculture in this country in the inter-war period werethe steady decline in the tillage acreage and the slow deterioration of much of ourpermanent grassland. Both were, of course, due to the low world prices of cereals.Land, was laid down or tumbled down to grass and because grass of a kind will grow easily in this country little attention was given to maintaining its feedingvalue. Farmers came to rely more and more on cheap imported feeding stuffsnot merely, as in the case of Danish agriculture, as a supplement to what theycould grow on their own farms but as a substitute for arable crops and even for good grass and hay. Whole districts came to consist of all-grass farms. Much ofthe grassland had very little feeding value for grazing or hay and was littlemore than an exercise ground for dairy cows or a ranch for cattle and sheep. Ina survey of the grassland of England and Wales undertaken before the war itwas found that out of some 16 million acres of permanent grass, excluding roughgrazings, only 250,000 acres could be classified first class from the point of viewof its feeding value and only 950,000 as second class; the remainder was third and, fourth class. The difference between the feeding value of a first class anda fourth class pasture is very great. A first class pasture has thirteen times the feeding value of a fourth class pasture measured in terms of starch equivalent.An acre of first class pasture will provide 350 gallons of milk, compared with only 54 gallons provided by a fourth class pasture. It is generally known thatpermanent grassland,, if not properly stocked and managed, will quicklydeteriorate. It is not, however, generally realised that even when reasonablymanaged the grass growing on many soils will deteriorate OA^er a period of years,weeds and inferior grasses taking the place of the grasses of high feeding value.The Ministry&apos;s survey showed how far this process of deterioration had gone.Modern grassland science has also shown that temporary grass, i.e., leys, lastingfor periods of one to ten years, which has always been a common practice in certain parts of the country, will, if proper fertilisers and seed mixtures are used, beof first class feeding value carrying a far heavier head of stock and producingfar more milk or meat than the ordinary third or fourth class pastures which,as shown above, represented nearly the whole of our permanent grassland beforethe war.14. This modern knowledge is obviously of the highest importance to a countrylike this whose principal crop is grass, and it is contemplated that agricultural policy should be directed, to promoting a wide extension of what is known as&quot;&apos;&apos; alternate husbandry&quot; or &quot;ley farming,&quot; as the basis of mixed farmingsystems. The system is already well tried and proved, as is shown by its fairlywidespread adoption in the north and west. Alternate husbandry means thealternation of grass and crops, the grass being in the form of leys varying induration from one to ten years, according to the soil and the purpose for whichthey are required. On a farm where this system is operating, the plough wouldbe taken round the farm and every year a certain proportion of the land wouldbe under arable crops. The bulk of the land on such a farm ;would no longer be under permanent grass and there would no longer be a rigid division betweenpermanent grass and arable.Alternate husbandry means a great improvement in grassland and asubstantial increase in the arable acreage. Besides maintaining the land in ahigh state of productivity and fertility, alternate husbandry has the furtheradvantages that it provides a high degree of flexibility and adaptability formixed farming systems; that it enables larger numbers of grass-eating animals,mainly cattle and sheep, to be kept on a given acreage of land and that it provides not only more grass for grazing and hay but fodder crops for winterkeep. It is the best way of securing a marked increase in milk production, if that should be required. It would also reduce animal diseases and promote a higher standard of general health in our flocks and herds a matter of great economicsignificance in view of the very heavy losses at present caused by disease,especially among dairy cattle and sheep.&apos; 15. What would be the amount and character of the production that couldbe expected from the varied types of mixed farming and the extension of alternatehusbandry suggested above given reasonably satisfactory economic conditions and
having regard to the probable trend of public demand and to the fact thatshall continue to import a large proportion of the agricultural products thatwe require ?: It has already been indicated that under any agricultural policy designed to-maintain the bulk of the agricultural land in this country in productivity aridfertility there will continue to be a wide range of food and other productsproduced. The proportions will vary according to public demand and economic circumstances. It is, however, possible to give some general indication of theoutput of staple products which would follow from the policy proposed.(A) Livestock. .Livestock and livestock products would continue to form a predominant partof the output.(a) Cattle. The improved grassland would mean an increase in the numberof cattle. With the present trend of public demand stimulated and encouraged by nutritional policy this increase would mainly be in dairy cattle. Given a wide-spread extension of efficient systems of alternate husbandry, we could carry amuch larger population of dairy cattle. The need for more milk production andfor improved standards of milk production and the health of our dairy herds calls for some transfer of milk production from the specialist suburban dairy farmson unsuitable land to mixed farms operating systems of alternate husbandry.Assuming that we should continue to rely mainly on imports for our suppliesof butter and cheese, it should be possible to increase our dairy herds sufficiently to meet any probable demand for liquid milk, using the surplus that would be needed to ensure any given demand for liquid milk for the higher-priced manu-factured milk products. Numbers of beef cattle could be rather larger than atpresent.(b) Sheep. There should be some increase in the numbers of sheep over thepre-war figure.(c) Pigs and Poultry. Restoration to pre-war figures. Specialist pig and poultry production is of little importance from the point of view of maintaining,the agricultural land of this country in productivity and fertility, and it wouldnot be possible on agricultural grounds to claim that such production should, begiven special protection or assistance. With the policy proposed steps should,however, be taken to secure a considerable increase in numbers of pigs and poultryon mixed farms.(B) Crops.v A development of alternate husbandry would involve a substantially largeracreage under the plough in any given year than existed before the war. It isthought that it might amount to about 16 million acres in the United Kingdom(about 12 million acres in England and Wales), including leys of one or two years&apos;duration. It is contemplated that a considerable part of the remaining grasslandwould be leys of three or more years&apos; duration instead of permanent grass. Thiswould mean an increase of about 3 million acres in the arable acreage comparedwith the pre-war figures. It would, however, be no larger than the arable acreageat the beginning of the century under conditions of complete laissez-faire, and inthe main the increased arable acreage would be devoted to fodder crops for.feeding to livestock and not to cash crops. The figure of 16 million acres can atpresent only be regarded as an indication of the extent of the acreage which itmight be found necessary or desirable to keep under the plough. &apos; The actualacreage to be aimed at would depend on a variety of circumstances, both technical and economic, which cannot now be determined with precision. ,(a) Potatoes. We are normally self-sufficient in potatoes.   The pre-war .acreage in the United Kingdom was 700,000.  In the light of modern nutritional&apos;&apos;requirements we shall probably eat more potatoes after the war.   We mayanticipate growing, say, 800,000 acres, or more.(b) Wheat. It would be unwise to seek to make ourselves appreciably moreself-sufficient in wheat than we were before the war, but a development ofalternate husbandry would probably involve some increase over the pre-war wheatacreage. In connection with the recent conference in Washington it was contemplated that the post-war wheat acreage in Great Britain would be about million acres compared with 1,800,000 before the war.
(c) Sugar Beet. The present sugar-beet acreage is determined by the-capacity of the existing sugar-beet factories. The industry having beenestablished, it should be continued because of the place the sugar-beet crop nowoccupies in arable farming in many districts and as an insurance in case of future wars. Post-war policy should aim at continuing production at the pre-war level.(d) Malting Barley. It would appear unnecessary and undesirable,especially in view of the prospective balance of payments, to import Californianor other malting barley or substitutes after the war. Brewers and distillers coulddepend on home sources for their supplies of malting barley. This would mean a considerable expansion over the pre-war barley acreage. Production would automatically be regulated by demands from brewers and distillers, and any.surplus barley not taken for malting&quot; will go for feeding to livestock.(e) Oats.- In Scotland and Northern Ireland oats is the principal cerealcrop and the extent of its production must be determined by the demand foroatmeai as well as its use..for feeding to livestock. In England and Wales theconsideration mentioned in sub-paragraph (f) would apply also to oats.(f) Other fodder crops feeding barley, beans, peas, kale, &amp;c-A substantial increase would follow from the policy proposed.(g) Vegetables. Before the war we supplied a large proportion of our requirements in vegetables, apart from onions and tomatoes and early vegetables!The future of vegetable production depends largely on public demand. Therewould be no difficulty in meeting any increased demand.(h) Fruit. There is no very strong agricultural case for encouraging a largeexpansion of home fruit production. The problem is largely one of maintaining a fairly stable market. Considerable progress was being made before the war inthis direction by producers themselves through the medium of the Empire FruitConference.16.   The policy proposed would thus mean an increase in the generalproductivity of domestic agriculture to some significant extent and would involve some reduction in pre-war imports of food and feeding stuffs.   Before the warimports of food and feeding stuffs amounted to some 22 million tons, valued at.some  374 million.   The agricultural policy here proposed, allowance being madefor increased efficiency, might entail a reduction of such imports to about19 million to 20 million tons, valued at about  330 million to  340 million (at present -war values).   It would not, therefore, entail any radical change in national economic policy, but only some comparatively modest increase in the productionfjom our soil, a step which might be advantageous from other standpoints in view,of the difficulties we shall have in paying for imports on the pre-war scale.   Itmay be added, however, that under the proposed policy, if it were- necessary or desirable still further to increase production from our soil and to reduce imports,it would, of course, be quite possible to do so.   What is. indicated here is theminimum increase in production and reduction in imports that would probably benecessary to secure the maintenance of the bulk of our agricultural land in?productivity and fertility.   As will be seen, the main feature of the policy isto grow better grass and increased quantities of arable fodder crops for our live-stock and thus reduce the imports of animal feeding stuffs.   It is thought that under any other policy it would not be possible to maintain the bulk of our agricultural land in productivity and fertility without a greater measure ofprotection or assistance and a greater reduction  of , imports than that hereproposed.17. What measures would be required, and what would it cost to maintainall reasonably good agricultural land in a state of fertility and productivity underappropriate and efficient systems of farming ?Countries like Britain, France and Germany can probably produce theordinary range of products of European mixed farming (cereals, potatoes, sugar-beet, milk, beef, mutton, pigmeat, eggs, vegetables and fruit) about as cheaply assuch a range of products taken as a whole can be produced in most othercountries, assuming that the fertility of the soil is maintained. But each separateitem can be produced more cheaply in some other country where conditions are specially favourable wheat in North America, beef in the Argentine, mutton anddairy products in New Zealand. Moreover, if agriculture and the agricultural population is to be maintained over the bulk of the agricultural land in old-
established countries, it must be maintained on land which is of average quality,and, indeed, on land which is of less than the average quality as well. as on the, .most fertile land, and such land can hardly compete with selected land in the, ,vast sparsely-populated exporting countries.   Some protection and/or assistances,,is therefore essential.  Without it only the most fertile land in countries like this could be maintained in productivity and fertility.   The degree of protection and/or assistance required will be less in so far as systems of mixed farming arevaried and based as far as possible on natural geophysical factors, and if they;are devoted, as far as is compatible with sound farming practice, to the products!which give the highest money return per acre of land.18.   The means of securing the necessary economic stability are dealt within Part II below.   The cost would depend on such factors as the following :-(a) The extent to which the efficiency of British agriculture has improvedas a result of the war relatively to that of the exporting countries.(6) The extent to which world prices of staple food and feeding stuffs riseabove the very low levels prevailing before the war.(c) The extent to which countries like the United States direct their agricui-tural production to providing more of the protective foods requiredfor the optimum diet of their own population.(cl) The extent to which social policy is directed to subsidising consumptionof protective and other foods, e.g., milk.(e) The extent to which under a more regulated system economies can beeffected in merchanting, processing and distribution.(/) The extent to which electricity and water supplies can be made availablefor agriculture at rates comparable to those at which they are availableto manufacturing industry.So long as these factors are uncertain, it would not appear possible to make anestimate of the cost of maintaining British agriculture on the level indicated above. The main new item would be the difference in the cost of producing alarger proportion of our animal feeding stuffs as a result of (a) an increase ofour arable acreage by, say, 2 to 3 million acres and (b) an improvement in ourgrassland, as compared with the cost of importing the feeding stuffs therebyreplaced. While it may not be possible to frame a definite estimate at thepresent time, it should not be assumed that the difference in cost would necessarily be large, especially if the proposed increase in arable acreage over the pre-war level were secured by assistance to costs of production rather than to prices.II. Economic Stability.19. In formulating permanent post-war agricultural policy Ministers have indicated, as stated in paragraph 3 of this memorandum, that we should adopta policy to secure to the utmost practicable extent measures for the economic stability of the industry. For a domestic agriculture which is directed nottowards the maximum degree of self-sufficiency or maximum production, but tothe more limited objective which has already been indicated, the problem ofsecuring economic stability is one of providing for home agriculture a guaranteedshare of the domestic market and of providing returns in respect of that sharewhich will as a whole provide a fair remuneration for the efficient farmer. Inother words, what is needed is a guaranteed market for the amount of home production indicated in the preceding section of this memorandum and guaranteedreturns in respect of that amount of production. This involves regulation,including regulation of home production and marketing. The question howfarmers are to be assured of such a market and of returns which would be adequate to maintain agriculture of the character and on the scale which hasbeen indicated depends on whether we shall return after the war to an economic system under which, while there is some regulation of imports, there is a free ,market, or whether the Ministry of Food will remain in existence for the timebeing and be succeeded by some type of organisation for the wholesale purchaseof food and the exercise of some degree of control over internal distribution.20. If we have to frame agricultural policy on the basis of the former-alternative, then we should have to revert to a variety of schemes such as was-inoperation&apos; before the war for maintaining some stability of markets and prices.
Internally, we should have to revive the system of marketing boards and commis-sions which were in existence or in prospect before the war. As regards imports,there is no single principle or method that can be satisfactorily applied to allagricultural commodities. Subsidies, levy-subsidies, quantitative regulation,tariffs, &amp;c, would have to be. readopted for the various agricultural commodities to which each method was particularly suited.21. Such measures and devices are unsatisfactory. Not only do they lead tomisunderstanding and irritation among both farmers and townsmen, but it isalmost impossible to relate the degree of protection or assistance under them toany agricultural policy directed to maintain a healthy and well-balancedagriculture. In practice each commodity has to be dealt with separately, and the eventual degree of protection is a compromise between conflicting departmentalinterests. The outcome is a piecemeal policy and an unbalanced agriculture.Moreover, unless some control is exercised over retail prices, i.e., over the relation between the retail prices of alternative forms of food [e.g., between butter and margarine or between different forms of meat), it may be difficult to provideeconomic stability either for domestic or overseas producers.22. . In the alternative there would be bulk purchase of imports of staplefoodstuffs, and it should be possible to control the prices and volume of the mainagricultural products, dealing with domestic production either by directpurchase or under specific arrangements fixing the price for certain productscoupled, where necessary, with regulation of production. Quantitative regula-tion of imports, as understood in pre-war days, would be unnecessary. Thiswould enable the great advantages of stable prices and secure markets to becontinued, and farmers would be able to plan ahead with a sense of security.It would, moreover, give a far greater measure of administrative flexibility. in determining the wholesale and retail prices at which food would be sold in thecountry the central organisation would continue to take into account the pricesof its domestic and overseas purchases and endeavour to balance its accounts thus applying, in effect, the principle of levy subsidy to the bulk of the foodgrown in this country.23. It would, however, be essential that, in determining price policy andin particular the relationship between the prices of the different staple com-modities, consideration should be given to the objective of agricultural policy,and effective machinery would have to be devised for this purpose. the objective of price policy should be to ensure that the returns of the various types of farming which it is desired to encourage should as a whole provide a fairremuneration for the efficient farmer.24. While the remuneration of the farmer should be fair, it should be no more than fair, but a certain dilemma arises. Prices which are adequate for efficient farmers on moderate land will be more than adequate to those farminghighly fertile land. An alternative way of providing adequate returns would bea subsidy in respect of costs of production combined with lower prices of pro-ducts. A payment per acre with a pro tanto diminution in the prices which otherwise would be necessary would probably be practicable in the case o*f certaincash crops. This and other forms of subsidy on costs of production would reducethe disparity between returns on moderate and exceptionally fertile land; theycould be used to encourage good husbandry and proper rotation of crops and alsoalternate husbandry. They could also be used to encourage particular types ofdairying, &amp;c, which might be desired. There are, on the.other hand, practicalobjections to such subsidies. Farmers feel, however illogically, that a directsystem of adequate prices fixed in advance is more analogous to the protection given to industry by tariffs, and direct subsidies excite more public attention and criticism than tariffs do.A agricultural Wages..25. An important factor in determining the post-war level of farmers&apos;returns will be the level of wages for agricultural workers. While for various reasons, and particularly the development of machinery, it is not necessary toprovide for any large increase in the number of agricultural workers, it isessential to stop the drift from the land which was taking place before the war.It is particularly important to prevent the drift of young people from the land :unless it can be checked this drift will raise very serious problems for the futureof agriculture and be dangerous from a social as well as an economic point of[240911 C
view. An adequate rate of recruitment of juveniles to agriculture must be main-tained. In the post-war period industry and agriculture will be competing-against each other for a dwindling supply of juvenile recruits, and if thedemands of industry are maintained (or possibly increased) the problem ofjuvenile recruitment in agriculture will become increasingly more acute.26. There are many factors which have led to the drift of young &quot;people from the land the urban bias of education, the attraction of town life, the lackof opportunity for advancement, the lack of suitable cottages for young agricul-tural workers when they w,ant to get married, &amp;c.; but the most important has undoubtedly been the disparity between agricultural wages and wages in other occupations.* It is essential that the level of prices should be such as will pro-vide for a reasonable wage comparable to those in other occupations in rural districts. The Agricultural Wages Acts provide the necessary machinery forassuring a reasonable standard of wages, but this machinery will not work unlessfarmers&apos;&quot; returns are at a level which enables them to pay the wages.III. Land Utilisation.The need for general State control.27. If all reasonably good agricultural land is to be maintained in a stateof fertility and productivity it is necessary to stop large areas of productiveagricultural land being lost to agriculture under the working of a system ofindiscriminate speculation and unplanned urban and industrial development.If we are to make proper use of our resources in agricultural land it is in thefirst place necessary to secure effective united national control of the utilisation of agricultural land.28. The final Avord on control should be vested in an impartial Centralauthority and not be left to Local Authorities. The Government is alreadypledged to the establishment of a Central Planning Authority, whose mainfunction will be to secure that our land resources are used to the best advantage from the national point of view, and that agricultural land is not diverted fromfood production without good reason. The principles which should govern the utilisation of land in the national interest and the means by which these principles should be carried into practice are at present under consideration byCommittees appointed by the Government.The need for a Land Commission.29. How is land reserved for agricultural purposes to be efficiently main-,tained for these purposes, i.e., how are proper standards of upkeep of land and buildings to be secured ?Some degree of State control, coupled with some degree of State purchase,would appear to be required. The present rates of income tax and surtax, com-bined with the incidence of the death duties, if that incidence cannot be modified,would make it difficult, if not impossible, after the war, for many landowners to fulfil their proper function in maintaining their estates and providing capital for improvement. From the point of view of agricultural efficiency, where land-owners are unable to maintain agricultural land or buildings in proper conditionor to find the capital for improvements or do not, in fact, adequately performthese functions, it will be necessary for the State to take action.30. It is suggested that a Land Commission should be appointed by theMinister of Agriculture and a similar body by the Secretary of State forScotlandt to acquire and manage agricultural estates and single farms in thefollowing circumstances :-(a) They would acquire estates or farms voluntarily offered by existingowners, much in the same way as the Forestry Commission acquiresland for afforestation.(b) They would have the right to call upon existing owners to do necessaryworks of maintenance or improvement, and in the event of defaultcompulsorily to acquire the estates or farms in question.* In Scotland housing conditions are probably at least equally important.f No specific recommendation is made regarding the establishment of a Land Commissionin Northern Ireland, where landlords&apos; interests have been vested in the tenants&apos; under thevarious Land Purchase Acts. The problem of securing proper standards of upkeep of land anjdbuildings exists in Northern Ireland as well as in Great Britain,, for the owner-occupier is not always the ideal landlord from the point of view of the national interest. The precise mannerin&apos; which this object should be achieved is being considered by the Northern Ireland Department.
-In both cases the price to be paid would be a fair value of the land as an agricultural estate or farm, i.e., so many years&apos; purchase of the net rent or annualyalue, without regard to amenity values.31. It will be appreciated that the proposed terms of purchase are drastic.The ordinary market value of purely agricultural land (apart from any develop-ment value) has in the past been exceedingly high in relation to its net annualyield. This has been in part due to the competition of corporations whichdesire to make investments to hold in perpetuity and in part to the readiness of individuals to pay high prices by reason of what is known as the amenity valueattached to the ownership of an agricultural estate. It is uncertain how far thisamenity value will continue after the war. In any case, the State could not reasonably afford to buy at a price which included amenity value, since such value,regarded as a separate element in. the total value, brings no annual monetaryreturn. It is believed, however, . that compulsory purchase upon the linesmentioned would be generally accepted as reasonable, provided it was clear that itapplied only in cases of land which was not being properly maintained and managed, and that there was general confidence in the good judgment and fairnessof the Commission operating the provisions, and provided also it was accom-panied by some relief from the burdens which press severely upon agriculturallandowners. The latter condition would be met if, at the appropriate time, theChancellor of the Exchequer found it possible to make some important alteration- in the incidence of death duties upon agricultural land.32. Payment by the-Land Commissions might be made in the form of LandBonds or Stock bearing interest comparable to ordinary Government securitiesand guaranteed by the Government. The Commissions would need finance for works of maintenance and improvement. In the early post-war years, however,it must be anticipated that the demand for capital for purposes of reconstruction and the overtaking of arrears of maintenance in many connections will be exceedingly heavy, and it is recognised that these considerations must govern the amount of capital facilities which can be provided and the pace at whichthey can be provided.33. It would be desirable that the Land Commissions should have powerto grant long leases of estates or farms subject to the observance of strictconditions as to proper maintenance.34. The Land Commissions should be responsible to the Minister ofAgriculture and the Secretary of State for Scotland, respectively, to ensure thatthey carry out their operations in accordance with general agricultural policy,but should so far as possible have a free hand regarding the actual management of their estates and farms, including the selection of tenants, fixing of rents, &amp;c.The use of agricultural land: farming types and systems.35. The next problem is how to ensure that agricultural land shall be put to appropriate agricultural uses and that proper standards of farming shall bemaintained. It has been suggested above that the main objective of agricultural policy should be to promote, properly balanced systems of mixed farming over aswide an area as possible. There may, however, be a need for further afforestationwhich would absorb some of the poorer land; and there will be a further. considerable acreage of poor land which will only be suitable for fairly extensivegrazing, preferably on long leys coupled with crop production at intervals of  or 10 years. It is probable that in the immediate post-war years a largeproportion of the land to be&quot; acquired by the proposed Land Commission will bemarginal land, and the Commission should be able to try out various types of farming designed to maintain the fertility of such land, even if it cannot be madehighly productive under the economic conditions likely to prevail in time ofpeace.36. There are at present in the. United Kingdom 537,751 agricultural holdings Of over one acre, made up as follows : Description. No. of Holdings.Smallholdings up to 50 acres ...      ...      ... ...     357,881*Small farms 50 to 100 acres ...     ....      ... :..      83,635Medium farms 100 to 300 acres       ....... ...&quot;    81,501Large farms 300 acres and upwards ...      ... ...      14,734* Not all are separately farmed units.[24091] c 2
Farms of over 100 acres, though much fewer in number than farms of less than100 acres, comprise two-thirds of the total agricultural land of the country. Itwill be desirable to encourage mixed farming of various types on all sizes ofholdings and farms. Many smallholdings and small farms will continue to be devoted mainly to horticulture and pig and poultry-keeping. On ordinary land and in most districts it is desirable, even in the case of smallholdings, to avoidundue specialisation.37. Some people, who -think it would be desirable on social grounds to restore a large rural population, recommend a wide extension of more or lessintensive smallholdings and small farms run either as individual units or undersettlements which provide for co-operative effort in production and marketing.It must, however, be recognised that in a country which has become predominantlyurban and industrial we cannot maintain or recreate the peasant type of agricul-ture any more than we can revert to a form of agriculture which requires a large amount of exceptionally cheap labour. There may be some possibility of anextension of smallholdings and co-operative settlements mainly concerned withhorticulture, poultry and pig-keeping, but the amount of land required to producevegetables for optimum consumption by. the people of this country would be quite insignificant compared with the total acreage of our agricultural land.Moreover, the use of machinery of all kinds and other modern scientific develop-inents all tend to require large rather than small units for their economic use.It may be desirable gradually to effect some increase in the present numbers ofsmallholdings. There is in many counties a waiting list of agricultural workers who possess the necessary knowledge, experience and capital to take a small-holding ; and the smallholding forms the first step in the ladder for the farm worker who has the ambition to become a farmer. But experience hasshown that only an exceptional man is likely to make a success as a smallholder,and that there is a strict limit to the number of extra smallholdings that shouldbe provided.38. There is no need to encourage an expansion of the numbers of the smallfamily farm of 50 to 100 acres. The small farm is in many ways well suitedfor the type of farming in which the rearing of livestock plays a prominent part.On some soils it is a suitable size for a farming system in which milk, pigs and eggs are the chief products sold off the farm. It is also useful as a second step in the ladder for the successful smallholder. The drawback, however, is that itencourages a type of farmer who has insufficient capital and limited knowledge,and is therefore unable to take proper advantage of modern methods and improvements. It will therefore probably need the greatest measure of control to secure the maintenance of adequate standards of farming.39. The moderate-sized farms of between 100 and 300 acres are suitableunits on some soils and for some types of farming, e.g., mixed dairy/arablefarming supplemented by poultry and/or pig keeping. For land where arablefarming predominates, however, they are in many cases no longer convenient or economic units. They date from a period before the advent of the tractor whenall the farm work was done by horses and there was an ample supply of cheaplabour. Modern mechanisation normally requires larger units for its efficient and economic use. In these cases it would be desirable that the Land Commission,and the County Executive Committees which it is proposed in paragraph 43below should exercise control over farming efficiency, should encourage suitableredistribution of land and buildings into more economic units.40. With the development of tractors and modern machinery there shouldbe an increase, though it can only be gradual, in the number of large farms(i.e., farms over 300 acres) provided that sufficiently satisfactory economicconditions can be established to attract the considerable amount of capitalrequired to run them successfully. They provide opportunities for skilledmanagement and a high output per man employed especially where crop produc-tion is an important element on the farm.41. In many districts it will be desirable on economic grounds and for the sake of promoting efficiency to rearrange farm boundaries and regroup farms.This is clearly a reform that can only be accomplished gradually. As indicated above, however, it should be possible for the proposed Land Commission tore-divide estates which it may acquire.   It would also be desirable to continue
the existing powers under which tenancies can be terminated for the purpose ofrearranging farm boundaries where the land remains in private ownership.Control of Standards of Farming.. 42. The control of farming to ensure good husbandry was in the old dayssupposed to be the function of the landowner. But the Agricultural HoldingsAct of 1923, while it gave the tenant much-needed security of tenure,- in effectdeprived the landowners of any real power to enforce good husbandry. Moreover,since 1918 a third of the farms of the country have passed into the hands of owner-occupiers and it is generally agreed that for various reasons these are onthe whole the farms where the standards of farming and the condition of theland had deteriorated most before the war. This was more particularly the case where an unduly high purchase price was paid after the last war.*&apos;43. There is already a great deal of support for the view that the solutionof this problem is to be found in the maintenance of bodies like the County war agricultural Executive Committees, i.e., Committees appointed by the minister with an adequate technical advisory staff and with powers (delegated to them bythe Minister) to give directions, to terminate tenancies and, if necessary, to recom-mend the Land Commission compulsorily to acquire farms. Control designedto maintain adequate standards of farming is the price which farmers wouldhave to pay, and would be willing to pay, for economic stability. This subject is dealt with later in this memorandum.Land Drainage.44. Efficient land drainage is essential to the proper cultivation of land.In England and Wales much work has been done since the passing of the land drainage Act, 1930, by the Catchment Boards set up under that Act and by the drainage Boards which were either already in existence or have been constitutedsince 1930. It is, however, desirable that the Ministry should have more effective powers of controlling Catchment Boards than is given in the 1930 Act and provision might be made for the supersession of such Boards by Commissionersappointed by the Minister if it appears that the drainage work on the &quot; mainriver &quot; is being neglected. Furthermore, more stringent powers of control overInternal Drainage Boards should be given to Catchment Boards, or in default tothe Minister. Catchment Boards have been given power during the war toprepare drainage schemes for areas outside the &quot;main river,&quot; but they have no power of maintaining watercourses so improved after the war emergency has passed. Provision should be made enabling Catchment Boards to maintain the drainage of these areas by collecting contributions from the landowners or farmerswho are benefited. War-time powers of giving directions conferred in various ways on Executive Committees, Catchment Boards and Drainage Boards shouldbe maintained, possibly in a modified form. In view of the proposed transference of many of the agricultural functions of the County Councils to County Agri-cultural Executive Committees it is a matter for consideration whether&apos; the drainage powers of County Councils should not be transferred to DrainageAuthorities (including Catchment Boards) and County Agricultural Executive- Committees. In Scotland arterial works should be carried out, as under recentlegislation, by the Department of Agriculture for Scotland.Farm Survey.45. In addition to the official agricultural statistics and the Farm Manage-ment Survey which for the past few years agricultural economists have been carrying out under the aegis of the Ministry, the County War AgriculturalExecutive Committees in England and Wales are undertaking a farm-to-farmsurvey to secure full information about general farming conditions and about the potentialities of individual farms from the point of view of food production intime of war. The information collected as a result of the survey, which is beingtabulated by the provincial Advisory Economists, added, to existing sources ofinformation, will give valuable assistance to the Ministry and the proposed land commission in framing detailed plans for the best utilisation of agricultural land after the war.* The remarks about the condition of owner-occupied farms apply more particularly toEngland.
46. In Scotland the Department have undertaken, through the officers ofAgricultural Executive Committees, a farm survey with the object of securinginformation as to the agricultural potentialities of Scotland as a whole. the survey will have particular reference to land utilisation and is designed to discoverthe best capabilities of the land in each district, and from this the amount, of.production of the various classes of crops.and livestock which could reasonably be aimed at for the whole country. The officers of Executive Committees havebeen assisted in the enquiry by the Advisory Economists of the AgriculturalColleges, who have given guidance on the scope and layout of the investigation,Work of a similar character is in progress in Northern Ireland.IV. Promotion of Efficiency.(a) Production.47. For many years before the war great efforts were made to improve theefficiency of farming. These involved the expenditure of large sums of money on research, education, improvement of livestock and grassland, eradication pfpests, &amp;c. These efforts did not meet with the success they deserved largely because agriculture was passing through one of the worst periods of depressionthe industry had ever known. Farming capital was dwindling, low andfluctuating prices ruled and there was often a lack of profits even for the besttypes of farming. Only wages, a high part of farm costs, remained largelystabilised by legislation. As a result, farmers tended to adopt low farmingmethods, that is, those which would enable them to manage with the least amountof labour. Arable land was laid down to grass, maintenance work on drainingand ditching was neglected, and new and untried methods were left alone.Enterprise and initiative were sapped and few farmers could afford to takeadvantage of and try in practical farming the discoveries made in the researchfield.        -48. , As a result of this experience . it is idle to suppose that farmingefficiency can be promoted without a measure of economic stability. Hard timesmay be useful in compelling producers to reduce costs and to adopt new methods,but in agriculture, where the largest item in costs, viz., wages, has been stabilisedby legislation, hard times tend to lead to lower standards and a decline infarming efficiency.49. Given a measure of economic stability, farming efficiency can be promoted in two main ways : (i) Research and education.(ii) Power to enforce proper standards of husbandry.Research and Education.50. It is very desirable to bring scientific research and practical agriculturecloser together; steps to that end have been taken by the recent appointmentof an Agricultural Improvement Council for England and Wales, with acorresponding body for Scotland. In present circumstances more education ismore important for the promotion of farming efficiency than more research.51. -The future of agricultural education is at present being consideredby a Committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Justice Luxmoore. They are-reviewing the arrangements not only for agricultural education for young people and at Colleges and University departments of agriculture but also for educational and advisory work among farmers. In the latter sphere it appearsclear that if farming efficiency is to be promoted and standards of farmingcontrolled, education and advice must continue to go hand-in-hand with powersof supervision and control as has been the case under war conditions. Thiswould point to a national service, since such functions could not be adequatelyperformed by Local Authorities or indeed be financed in manyof the agriculturalcounties where it is most needed. A State service or a system, such as exists in Scotland and in Northern Ireland would moreover facilitate the use by farmers of the services of the scientific and economic advisers attached to universities and Colleges..Control of Farming.52. Given economic stability it is essential to have some effective meansof ensuring farming efficiency and proper standards of husbandry.     As has.
&quot;been suggested in paragraph 43 there is general recognition among theagricultural community that supervision and control will be necessary and thatit will have to be exercised by maintaining bodies like the County war agricultural Executive Committees, i.e., Committees appointed by the Ministerand acting under his authority with an adequate technical, advisory and educational staff and with powers (delegated to them by the Minister) to give directions to farmers to terminate tenancies and if necessary to recommend theproposed Land Commission compulsorily to acquire farms.Other Measures for Promoting Efficiency.53. Measures for promoting efficiency in regard to the production of livestock and livestock products, i.e., measures to promote animal health and toimprove the quality of livestock will have to continue to be mainly administered by the Central Departments. The control of pests and diseases affecting cropswill have to be administered by the Departments in conjunction with CountyExecutive Committees.54. For farming efficiency and reduced costs of production it is important that supplies of electricity and water should be made available on farms atrates comparable to those at which they are available to manufacturing industry.Both electricity and water supplies are of particular importance to an agricultural system which is predominantly directed to the production of livestock and livestock products (notably milk).(b) Marketing.55. In the inter-war period special effort was directed to improving thesystem of marketing of home-produced agricultural products. This effort was directed to three main objects : (i) To reduce the wide gap between what the producer received and whatthe consumer paid,(ii) To promote the proper standardisation and grading of home produce to meet the demand of- modern large-scale retail distributiveorganisations in competition with the bulk supplies of standardisedand graded imports,(iii) To get farmers to organise collective bargaining machinery in theform of marketing boards and to give them statutory powers toenable them to regulate the marketing of agricultural products andto get a fair deal for the producer as against powerful distributiveand processing interests.56. The system of producer control embodied in the agricultural marketing Acts&apos; was found not to be suitable or adequate in all cases to securereforms in distribution&quot; and processing. The principle behind the LivestockCommission and the proposed Milk Commission was the setting up of, anindependent body (a) to initiate reforms in distribution and (b) to safeguard the general public interests.57. If in the post-war period we assume the continuation of some central organisation for the purchase of staple products as compared with a systemof free demand and supply, the problems with which we were faced before thewar will be profoundly changed. It will, however, still be necessary to promoteefficient standardisation and grading of certain products and to set up someeffective machinery for regulating the marketing of agricultural products andfor promoting efficiency in processing and distribution.58. Unless such steps are taken by the Government itself it will be^necessary to revert to the far slower method of independent Commissions and &apos;producers&apos; boards. Even if the Government acts itself, producers&apos; marketing boards will probably still be necessary and desirable as part of the reorganisedsystem. The principle of co-operation among producers is of great psychologicalvalue from the farmers&apos; standpoint and would help to maintain the interestof farmers in increasing marketing efficiency, an interest which they tend to lose under a system of stabilised prices. It must be an objective of agricultural policy to link price stability very closely with marketing reform and efficiency.59. Moreover, where home-produced foods reach the consumer in aprocessed form, e.g., bacon, milk products and canned fruits and vegetables,
the measures taken by farmers to increase efficiency in the production and quality of their product may be frustrated by bad processing and by the poormarketing of the finished product. It is important, therefore, that regulationof the processing and marketing of home-produced foods should be the counter-part of the promotion of agricultural efficiency and such measures must be aconcern of the Agricultural Departments. .&apos; ,Summary of Main Conclusions and Recommendations.  ,60. (i) In order to maintain our agricultural land in fertility and productivity varied systems of mixed farming are required over a large partof the country with a development of &quot; alternate husbandry,&apos;&apos; involving somesubstantial increase over the pre-war arable acreage.(ii) Having regard to our soil and climate, British agriculture, as anagriculture which is not directed to maximum self-sufficiency or maximum production from the soil but is complementary to an economic system which relieson a large importation of agricultural products, should continue &quot; to bepredominantly devoted to the production of livestock and livestock products^Grass should still be the principal crop in the north, west and midlands, of,England and Wales and over large parts of Scotland. There should be ailincrease in mixed farms in which dairying is the predominant element.(iii) It should be possible to maintain the bulk of our agricultural land infertility and productivity under varied systems of farming with production of a character and on a scale which would not involve a reduction of imports by morethan 10 per cent, of the pre-war volume and value, a reduction which may in anycase be necessary having regard to the prospective balance.of payments.(iv) Economic stability&apos; could best be secured as regards staple productseither (a) by a continuation of the Ministry of Eood or by Import Boardsarranging for the wholesale purchase of food and exercising some degree ofcontrol over internal distribution; or (.&amp;.) by a system under which the necessaryguaranteed prices and guaranteed market for the desired level of home produc-tion would be secured by subsidies supported by such regulation of imports,levies on imports or tariffs as may be necessary and consistent with post-war&quot;international arrangements or by some combination of these various methods.(v) National control over the use of land is required for the efficiency ofagriculture.(vi) There Will be a need for a Land Commission to acquire estates or farms,compulsorily if necessary, where the owners are unable or unwilling to maintainthem and find the necessary capital for improvements. It would be desirable atthe same time to make some important alteration in the incidence of death duties on agricultural land.(vii) In view of the diversity and intermixture of soils and the variations inrainfall and climatic conditions, it is not possible to generalise about sizes ortypes of farms, but mechanisation and other scientific developments make.itdesirable to encourage larger farm units in certain districts.(viii) Control over standards of farming should be exercised by bodies similarto the present County Agricultural Executive Committees, i.e., Committeesappointed by the Minister with adequate technical and advisory staffs and with powers (delegated to them &quot;by the Minister) to give directions and terminatetenancies. , . .(ix) Eor the promotion of farming efficiency agricultural education is of thefirst importance. Educational and advisory work among farmers should be linked with powers to supervise and control standards of farming and should not be leftto Local Authorities. The provision of electricity and water supplies to farms at reasonable rates is important.(x) Increased efficiency in marketing, processing and distribution is requiredto supplement increased efficiency in production. Economic stability should be linked with the marketing reform and efficiency.
