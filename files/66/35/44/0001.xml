(43) 144.April 8, 1943.TO BE  KEPT UNDER  LOCK AMD key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.THE FUTURE OF GERMANY.Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare.THE memorandum W.P. (43) 96 circulated by the Foreign Secretaryconcludes that it would be impracticable to dismember Germany compulsoriiy,but that the following steps can be recommended as &quot; strategically necessary,politically expedient and economically desirable with a reasonable chance .ofsurviving as part of a permanent peace settlement, provided always the victoriousPowers retained over a sufficiently long period a preponderance of armed strengthand the will to use it in case of need &quot; : (a) Restoration of the territories seized by Germany since 1937.(b) Cession to Poland of East Prussia, Danzig and the Oppeln district ofSilesia.(c) Transfer of the control of the Kiel Canal to the United Nations.- (d) Some form of international control of industry generally and particularlyin the Rhineland.(e) Encouragement of spontaneous separatist movements with a view to thepossible development of a Federal Germany.2. The Ministry of Economic Warfare has submitted a paper to theMalkin Committee examining how far Germany&apos;s war potential could be controlled in the interest of world security by economic methods. The conclusion is significant and discouraging. The great dilemma is that a lasting peace canonly be assisted by a prosperous Germany. Economic distress and unemployment would reproduce the situation in which Hitler climbed to power. Practically allthe great industries of peace, however, play their part in total war. No country&apos;power of making war can therefore be reduced by economic measures without alsoimpairing its capacity for peace-time prosperity. To surmount this dilemmavarious expedients have been suggested.(1) The destruction of ersatz war industries such as synthetic oil and synthetic -rubber.3. It may be argued that Germany would accept this as it will always becheaper for Germans to buy natural oil and rubber, and therefore these are essentially war-time industries and not peace-time&apos; industries. &quot; Two principaldifficulties about this are that- ;(a) Any economic control not forming part of some international systemapplicable to all nations perpetuates on the country subjected to it thestatus^of a conquered but potentially dangerous and hostile Power.(&amp;) The suggestion ignores the march of science. It may well be that before long these substances will be capable of manufacture in competition with the natural product.[25277]   &apos; b
The prohibition of these industries would then not merely humiliate theGermans, but would also impoverish them. Moreover, new ersatz industriesmay be invented.(2) The destruction of key war industries such as the machine-tool-makingindustry.4. We might destroy ail the factories at present so engaged, but how isGermany to be prevented from gradually recreating the industry? What is a machine tool? The gradations of machine tools are infinite in number. Thispolicy could not be carried out without the permanent policing of Germany.(3) The transference of whole sections of Germany&apos;s industrial equipment to other european States so as to increase their economic strength at her expense.5. This might well result, within a few years, in German industry havingmore modern equipment than her rivals.(4) Limitation of Germany&quot;s stocks of raw materials, so that while her peace-timeindustries could function to full capacity, she would be unable to build upsupplies that would enable her to withstand a blockade.6. This proposal involves policing the key raw materials of the world such asnickel, copper, chrome, &amp;c, control of the German customs, and some system ofcheck on the stocks at works. It, therefore, again means the permanent policingof Germany.7. &apos; Can any politician who has lived through the years 1919 to 1939 believethat these economic measures, or &apos; the territorial changes recommended in w.P. (43) 96 as &quot;strategically necessary&quot; are likely to be accepted ex animoby German public opinion ? Yet, if that is not so, what chance is there of anypeace built upon them enduring any longer than the Treaty of Versailles ?&quot;A fortiori, the same considerations apply to any proposal to abolish theGerman aircraft industry, control of broadcasting, &amp;c, and indeed to the decision in the Atlantic Charter to deny Germany an Air Force and a Navy. The germans would make any of them a perpetual grievance.8. The factors that have always threatened and have twice disrupted world peace since 1870 are that the world&apos;s powder magazine is Europe, and in its centrelies Germany with its hardworking, pugnacious, efficient, restless,, ruthless, easilyled, and often increasing population. Her only possible rival in Europe is Russia,whose policies are incalculable, but whose tendency seems to be to look Eastrather than West. The rest of Europe is occupied either by races highly civilisedwith very small populations; or by races politically and economically backward;or by Latin races, whose history lies, it seems, in the past rather than the future.All these the Germans look down upon for being small, or uncivilised or decadent.At the gateway to Europe lies Great Britain, whom Germany regardswith some grudging respect and admiration, with some contempt, and with muchenvy and hatred. The British Empire she looks upon as having come together,as it were, by accident; as being a sort of unearned increment to England; aloosely-knit body with many divergent interests and no world policy, a fighterwith great potentialities, but never in training for a fight.Across the Atlantic Germany sees a great world Power with even less ofa world policy, less discipline, less training and less will to fight than GreatBritain.9. Germany, in her own eyes, should stand supreme in this world, peopled,except for the Teutonic race, by the weak, the barbarous, the decadent or the idlerich. Yet she, alone, of all the major European Powers, is confined to her ownnative soil and has no place in the sun.Any peace treaty, therefore, that placed Germany in a position ofpermanent inferiority in any respect to the Great Powers would be a Germangrievance, which the Germans would rapidly convince themselves was an intolerable grievance. -10- The Germans are past-masters in the art of nursing a grievance and being the &quot; injured innocent.&quot; They would pursue the tactics they pursued from1919 onwards. There would be a continuing squeal, year in and year out, about their pitiable condition and the vindictive and monstrous treatment they had
received. At first, the war will have been Hitler&apos;s fault and the Nazis, later the blame will be shifted to the Poles and the Czechs, Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt to everyone except the German people. The Atlantic Charter will be cited, theywould never have made peace if that construction had been put upon it; they neverreally were beaten; they could have conquered England if they had wanted to.11. This propaganda will be turned in a perpetual stream first upon them-selves and then upon England and America, where there will always be anaudience to listen to anything sufficiently often repeated. It will be accompaniedby the tactics of the thin end of the wedge. First, this concession will be demanded as the price of German appeasement, then that. As Germany recoversher prosperity and her potential strength, her demands against her weaker neigh-bours will increase. If any European dispute, occurred she would at once try totake the stronger side. As each concession or commotion in Europe made Germanymore powerful her demands would enlarge, but in each case the issue would seeminsufficiently important to justify to England and America a war with a country the size of Germany.12. The Foreign Office paper W.P. (43) 96 touches the key of the problem in its proviso :  &quot; . . . . provided always the victorious Powers retained over a sufficiently long period a preponderance of armed strength and the will to use it in caseof need.&quot;The will of the victorious Powers will be in inverse ratio to the strengthof Germany. The more the strength of Germany grew, the less would Englandand America relish the prospect of a third world war. With each concessionGermany-would become more powerful till at last she found herself in a positionto resume the armed struggle. The Allies would finally end in persuadingthemselves that the only way to live peaceably with the Germans would be to-give them what they wanted, and we should then find ourselves&apos;back in 1936.13. The conclusion is that it is impossible to devise any settlement giving a promise of world security which would be acceptable to the great Germanpeople. The problem is German psychology. This has been recognised in all quarters and many liberal thinkers, such as the Archbishop of Canterbury andViscount Cecil, have admitted that there can be no world peace withouta German change of heart. To this end it has been urged that the risinggeneration of Germans must have Nazism educated out of them.14. How is that to be accomplished % By Anglo-Saxons or by Germans ?If by Anglo-Saxons, let us ask ourselves what influence a Nazi teacher wouldbe likely to have on the opinions of our own children if he were sent to teachthem against our will. The children would, of course, make it a point of honourto pay no attention to him not a difficult thing for any child. If, on the other,hand, the education is to be by Germans, where are the Germans to; do. it ? Theliberal-minded Germans were so feeble that they could not stop Hitler from becoming their dictator. Most of their less passive members have since beenliquidated in concentration camps. Does the history of the world record a singleinstance of public opinion being changed by coercion backed by foreign bayonets ?It was only yesterday. that General Smuts was complaining that the germans in South-West Africa had made no response to the liberal education given themby the Union Government. Is not then the forced re-education of the rising-generation of a nation which has burned the books of its own liberal thinkers,while their parents stand sullenly by, a slender peg on which to hang the fate of world peace ?15. The hope has been expressed that if the result of this war is the .establishment of democracy in Germany, the German nation would accept the defeat and lose the urge to dominate their neighbours, and it has been pointedout that both Spain and France, who once dominated Europe, have since becomegood Europeans. It was the hope in 1919 that the establishment of democracyin Germany would result in a pacific regime, but we now know that within twoyears the German Government started rearming and, within fifteen years thedemocracy had collapsed. Those who take the responsibility of urging that the experiment can be safely repeated should study carefully the history of theWeimar Republic. Examination will show that democracy never did functionunder that regime in the Anglo-Saxon sense. Political decisions were not madein a free ballot box or the voting lobbies, but from them there was a continuous[25277] b 2
appeal to the assassin&apos;s revolver which throughout the fourteen years wastolerated by German public opinion in a manner incomprehensible to Englishminds. It is wishful thinking to believe that the collapse of democracy inGermany was primarily due to French, pinpricks the occupation of the Ruhr,the economic slump, &amp;c. No doubt these calamities added greatly to the difficultiesof the Republic, but the more reasonable explanation is that Germany has not yetattained that stage of political development where discussion and compromisecan entirely take the place of force. Vice-president Wallace has pointed out thatdemocracy is based on the acceptance of Christian ethics. One of the manyGerman Ministers who was murdered succeeded in killing his assassin in thestruggle, and Cabinet colleagues of his sent wreaths to the assassin&apos;s funeral.Would that be possible in any country fit for democracy ?16. Moreover democracy in itself-implies no guarantee of pacifism unlessthe people themselves are pacific. On the contrary, in so much as democracyimplies a reflection of public opinion in the Government it means that it is thecondition of the opinion of the public that matters. If we are safe in relying onthe establishment and. survival of democracy in Germany, it means that inGermany there is no necessity for a change of heart. If we say that a changeof heart in Germany is necessary, we cannot rely on a German democracy to keepthe peace till that change has taken place. Certainly the historical parallels thatSpain and France, which once sought to dominate Europe, have undergone achange of heart, had little to do with democracy. This pacifism can be moretruthfully ascribed to their present relative weakness due to causes of internaldecay, Avhich are outside the scope of this discussion. The menace of Germanylies in the fact that there are no signs of internal decay and no signs of changeof heart. ,17.   If then we are forced to the conclusions that (a)-It is impossible to reduce substantially Germany&apos;s war potential for any length of years by any form of economic control without also injuringher peace-time prosperity and imposing a badge of servitude upon her;(b) It is impossible to change German public opinion by forced re-education;(c) German public opinion will never accept such territorial losses as east prussia and Silesia;we are confronted with issues which it would be criminal not to face squarelynow. No amount of wishful thinking will avoid the nemesis of a third world warwithin our children&apos;s lifetime.18.   The last paragraph of W.P. (43) 96 suggests the encouragement ofseparatist movements within Germany at the time of the debacle as a possible step.   The objections to forced dismemberment are obvious, but the advantages ofdismemberment are so. great that all possibilities should now be explored.   Theadvantages a,re as great on the moral as on the material side.   If the Germanss could be brought to believe that their past troubles lay in the False God of; &apos;&apos; Deutschland uber Alles &apos;&apos; raised by Bismarck, and that their future happiness; and security lie in a number of small States whose boundaries, honour and prosperity would be guaranteed by the United Nations, there would be an idealto set before them, in rivalry to the Hitler legend that will otherwise become a bigger menace than was the Napoleonic legend.19. No doubt there will be a hard core of German irreconcilables who will never accept such a solution, but if the shock of the debacle is sufficiently great,the opportunity of manoeuvring separatist movements may well occur. any settlement will depend on one section of Germans using force against the others.The Nazi movement came to power by force as well as by argument. It is the argument Germans best understand. How we play our hand will be quite as important as the cards we deal ourselves.20. It is, however, essential that the settlement, whatever it is, shouldcommend itself to the Anglo-Saxon sense of justice and to the long-term needsof Russia and Central Europe. Russia would clearly welcome the dismembermentof Germany and its accomplishment would immensely influence Russia&apos;s attitudetowards Western Europe. If Russia ever adopted an aggressive policy towardsV/estern Europe it would only be through fear of Germany. If that fear wasremoved by dismemberment, there would be much less likelihood of Russiapursuing an aggressive Western policy. The same considerations would apply with even greater force to Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and the Balkans.   If there
were a strong united Germany, Czechoslovakia would be very likely to gravitateto the Russian orbit for self-protection, and the Balkans would be faced with the choice of looking either to England or to Russia. With German dismembermenttheir security would be immeasurably increased.21. Would the Anglo-Saxon sense of justice accept German dismembermentas a permanent policy? Probably not if the dismemberment was crudely effected by force, but if a show of spontaneity could be produced by good stage manage-ment, and if the ground were first carefully prepared by propaganda, thepolicy might be generally accepted by the Anglo-Saxon public as the best solution.German unity was born of blood and iron. Its purpose was power : that power has been abused. The Germans themselves have reaped death and disaster twicefrom it, and under the blighting influence of the power lust, German poetry,music, literature and philosophy, which in the eighteenth and early nineteenthcenturies led all Europe, have withered beyond recognition.22. If the British and American public could accept the fact thatdismemberment was in the interests of Germany as well as of the rest of Europe,the moral force would not be lacking to maintain such a settlement. provided the German residuary States obtained a square deal in the new and better world,and Germans were not prevented from getting fat, it is to be hoped that Anglo-Saxon common sense would appreciate the advantages of such a solution to allconcerned. The question whether such movements are likely to arise in germany is discussed in W.P. (43) 96 and the conclusion is reached that they are by nomeans impossible. As is pointed out in that paper, the probability is that in themoment of collapse the German generals will take control, and that would provide an opportunity for developments to be guided in a desired direction. Their chiefconcern will be to save their own skins.23. The prime argument for a solution on these lines is that it provides amilitary sanction that would safeguard the world without preventing the germans from becoming individually prosperous.Neither of these ends can be achieved without the dismemberment ofGermany. Dismemberment turns all other sanctions from being impracticable to being practicable, and presents the Allies with a bridgehead which germany must pass before she again becomes powerful.24. The precise form that dismemberment should take is a question forexperts, but the following will show how a dismemberment scheme could be madeto fit in with other sanctions that have been proposed : *(a) East Prussia and the Silesian coalfield to be ceded to Poland.(b) The Saar to be ceded to France; Alsace-Lorraine to be restored.(c) The boundaries of Czechoslovakia to be restored.(d) The  German populations  from  all  the  above-mentioned territories(including the Sudeten Germans) to be moved.(e) The Kiel Canal to be placed under international control.(/) The remainder of Hitler&apos;s Germany to be split into the followingStates :  Prussia.Hanover.Westphalia.Bavaria.Austria.The boundaries of all these States would, be guaranteed by the Allies, and itwould be a casus belli with the Allies for any of the residuary States to attackanother or to amalgamate with it.  The offending State would at once be bombed.25. Once dismemberment were achieved a number of other sanctions wouldbecome much easier. International control of the Kiel Canal, abolition of ersatzindustries, prohibition of aircraft and armament industries, prohibition of an air force, an army and a navy, would be infinitely easier to enforce against fivesmall States, however indignant, than against one obstructing Empire. But itwould be necessary to be equally drastic in the other direction of ensuring thatafter the operation the patient recovered.   Unless the Germans find it possible
to live prosperously under the new regime, the policy will ultimately fail.   Tothis end the following provisions would be necessary :  (i) The excess of population in German States produced by the transference of territories to Poland and other Allies should be dealt with by the organised migration of Germans to America and other non-european countries. This, though no doubt very difficult, should not beimpossible. There are already large populations of German origin inthe United States, Canada and Brazil which have given very littletrouble. The problem will be diminished, by the fact that severalmillion Germans will have been killed in the war.(ii) Every effort^should be made to get the trade of the German States.goingagain. To this end the tariff barriers of Europe should be broken down as much as possible. Free trade may not be able to ensure peace,but it certainly makes war more difficult for small countries. Especiallyshould world trade be planned so that the German States areencouraged to develop trade with the outside world instead of with each other. If the residuary States were prevented from protectingagriculture, they would rapidly become dependent on cheap Americanwheat.(iii) The German States must enjoy the same facilities for air travel, broad-casting, &amp;c, as other European countries these services being supplied to them on a cheap commercial basis by an international authority.26. But besides making possible physical prosperity to the residuary Statesof Germany, it would be very desirable to create or foster as many differences between them as possible. For instance, it is important that their franchisesshould be different. This could be justified by the difference in political develop-ment of the different States, ext., Westphalia could claim a lower franchise thanPrussia.27..* An added buttress to division would be provided if some of the Statesrestored constitutional monarchies, while others became republics. Again, suchdevelopments would have to come from within, but, as already claimed, there areways and means of assisting movements. However unfashionable the idea may-be in certain quarters, the contribution that hereditary constitutional monarchiescan make to world peace is not to be despised. The hereditary system places the&quot;average man&quot; (as opposed to the super man) in a position of influence witheverything to lose and nothing to gain from change, and so placed he is a barrierto the upstart dictator. So long as the Kaiser reigned, Hitler was a corporal.The vanities of a Court give an element of colour to a people&apos;s life and provide an outlet for individual ambitions.   Snobbery is preferable to brutality.28. Moreover, it is doubtful whether large portions of Germany have yet reached the stage of political development where a republic is capable offunctioning.   The history of the Weimar Republic has already been alluded to.29. To sum up. If the main cause for the last two world wars be diagnosedcorrectly as the inferiority complex of the German people expressing itself in awill to dominate Europe, the remedy must be appropriate to the disease. Theestablishment of democracy in Germany in itself provides no guarantee ofpacificism, and it is impossible to ensure that the stresses on any German republicwould be less either internally or externally than they were on the WeimarRepublic. In any case, Europe will be very troublous for a generation after thiscataclysm. The Treaty of Versailles failed not because it went too far but because it did not go far enough. Compromises like the Polish Corridor can only leadto another war. The most dangerous compromise to repeat would be compromisewith Bismarck&apos;s Germany. No economic safeguard anyone has yet been able tosuggest provides a hopeful bulwark against a repetition of the history of1919-1939 so long as Germany remains united. Dismemberment of Germany isthe only sanction that will be enforceable.. 30. Nothing in this paper is meant to imply that the peace of Europe canbe maintained otherwise than by a strong Britain, prepared to play its part withother great peace-minded nations. That requisite is, however, beyond the scopeof the forthcoming Peace Treaty. The argument here is confined to the point that Economic Sanctions by themselves can contribute little to the endurance ofthat Treaty. The better bridgehead to defend, if it can be reached, is theindependence and individuality of the component parts of the German Empire-S.Ministry of Economic Warfare,April 8, 1943.
