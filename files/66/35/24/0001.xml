(43) 124.March 22, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war GABINET.SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS OF BOMBER COMMAND FROM1200 HOURS JANUARY 3, 1943, TO 1200 HOURSFEBRUARY 28, 1943.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Air.EVIDENCE of the effects of-the activities of Bomber Command since thebeginning of January is accumulating. The small raids conducted almost nightlyduring the first half of January, mainly over the Ruhr, gave some indication of the effort which was to follow. Since then all previous records have been broken, in persistency of effort, in tonnage of bombs dropped and in results achieved.2. During the period Essen was attacked eight times by small forces, largelyas a test of ability to operate with the improved navigational aids : heavierattacks were carried out against Berlin (twice) Cologne (three times)Wilhelmshaven (four times) Dusseldorf (twice) Hamburg (twice) Bremen andNuremberg (once). In occupied France, Lorient was attacked nine times by night.   In Italy, Milan and Turin were attacked once each.3. Activities by day were considerable. A record number of mines was dropped. An indication of the ability of the Command to overcome the limitations previously imposed by weather is that, in January and February 1943,3,680 sorties were carried out over Germany, compared with 1,502 in the comparable period of 1942. Appendix &quot;A&quot; gives a detailed siiiiiHiciry Oxoperational effort: mining activities and results are covered in Appendix &quot; B,&quot;.Operational Successes.Germany.Berlin.   (16th/17th and 17th/18th January.)4. The first of these attacks was the more.successful: the second was carriedout with 10/10ths cloud over the target, and bombing was somewhat scatteredas a result. Photographic cover shows numerous incidents of damage over theSouthern part of the town, and the suburban districts extending as far south asMarienfelde approximately 8 miles from the centre of the town.5. Photographic cover, and information from ground sources, confirm thefollowing incidents, apart from damage to residential property, and the admitteddamage to the Deutschland Halle, Germany&apos;s largest sports hall: Damage to electrical and gas works in the west of the city. Hits on thebuildings and railway tracks between the Anhalter and Potsdamer stations in the centre of the city.[25202] b18
Serious damage in the Neukoeln district near the Templehof aerodrome.Hits on the Lorenz radio factory and Riedel chemical works. Theformer are makers of wireless, telephone and teleprinter equipment, andsuppliers to the G.A.F. of blind-frying and radio aid apparatus.In the Teltow number of factories damaged, including theDaimler-Benz works.At Lichterfelde, the Telefunken works damaged, including a number ofother factories in the same district.6. During the first attack on 16th/17th January, it is said that the A,A.guns were worked chiefly by factory workers and civilian volunteers. Profes-sionals in considerable number were imported on the following day.7. Inhabitants of the Ruhr have commented unfavourably on the tumult andreprisals to which comparatively light raids on Berlin have given rise. TheEssen edition of Goring&apos;s National-Zeitung has deplored this tendency, and hasalso found it necessary to deny that the Rhinelanders feel any satisfaction at thetransfer, however temporary, of R.A.F. attentions from themselves to the capital.8. Two attacks on Berlin were made on the 30th January, the tenthanniversary of the Nazi- seizure of power. These were the first day raids thecity has experienced. Some damage was caused, and a number of unrehearsedeffects produced in Goring&apos;s broadcast. Although the speech was postponed for an hour, Transocean failed to learn this in time, and broadcast a colourfulreport of it at the time originally fixed.Wilhelmshaven (llth/12th, 18th/19th, 19th/20th and 24th/25th February).9. These four attacks were carried out by 177, 195, 338 and 143 aircraft respectively. The first attack, despite 10/10ths cloud, was probably the most successful, crews&apos; reports indicating a high degree of concentration over the target. The main ammunition depot at Mariensiel was blown up; and as aresult&apos;an area of buildings, covering about 150 acres was completely obliterated.Part of the Deutsche Werke was severely damaged by blast. It is understoodthat the depot contained very large stores of mines and other naval explosives.10. Photographic cover of the raids on the 18th/19th and 19th/20thFebruary confirmed that damage was not well concentrated. The last attack,carried out mainly with the help of navigational aids was promising. Photo-graphs taken before and after the raid on the 11th/12th February are attached.Cologne.   (2nd/3rd, 14th/15th and 26th/ 27th February).11. The first two raids were carried out by forces of 161 and 243 aircraft,largely by means of navigational aids. Both these raids were considered to be satisfactorily concentrated, but photographic cover was not obtained before thethird raid, carried out by a force of 428 aircraft, took place. Weather was good on the last occasion, and many crews identified the target visually. Therewas every indication that a good concentration had been achieved, and dayphotographs taken on the following day showed that fires were still burning.A final analysis of the effects of these raids is not yet available.Hamburg (30th/31st January.   3rd/4th February).12. Hamburg was attacked by 165 aircraft on the first raid, and by 263 Onthe second. &apos; Both were carried out mainly by the help of navigational aids, butweather on the second occasion became very bad and a number of aircraft had toreturn.13. Considerable damage was caused in the first raid, mainly in the harbourarea. Empty ships lying in the Segelschiff Hafen were hit, and also more thanone ship lying alongside the Petersen Kai. Damage was caused at Blohm andVoss, the Deutsche Werft and to several oil tanks. The Eimsbiittel district was without electricity on the 1st February. Some bombs fell in Finkenwarder, and itwas said that the railway bridge over, the Elbe was hit and damaged.Italy. :Turin (4th/5th February).14. Turin was the target for renewed attack by 188 aircraft. This was amost successful raid, and photographs taken on the 5th and 6th February, though not completely covering the city, show numerous points of fresh damage.
&apos; 15. In the Fiat (Lingotto) Aero Engine Works a group of multi-baybuildings beside the main block received a direct hit, which destroyed one building and damaged several others. In the northern part of the works a building100&apos; x 100&apos; has been burnt out.16. In the south-west part of the city at least four unidentified factorieswere wholly or partly destroyed by fire. One of them, a six-bay building in theVia Piestro Guiria, was still burning on the day after the attack.17. In the North-West part of the cityi an industrial building in the ViaPietrino Bello was burnt out. In addition, there was some damage to residentialand public buildings.IS.   Photographs taken on the 15th February showed damage in the westpart of the city not covered on previous sorties.19. In the Fiat steelworks, south of the river Dora, two large workshopshave been damaged by blast, and immediately to the south a heavy H.E. incidenthas demolished part of a block of business or residential buildings and destroyed or damaged several others in the vicinity.20. In Corso Francia another heavy H.E. incident has demolished manybuildings between Via Palmeria and Via Bagetti, with a large area of damageby blast. In the Statione di Porta Susa the viaduct carrying the Via DeliaCernaia over the railway has been completely destroyed at one point east of thestation.      -Milan (14/ 15th February).21. On the same night as the second of the three attacks on Cologne, 142aircraft raided Milan. Day photographic cover is incomplete, but suggests that heavy damage has been done in the city, mostly to factories by H.E. This has been confirmed from two reliable sources, who have reported extensive damage in thecentre of the town and to. factory premises.22. Casualties were heavy and increased by panic among the population.The Porta Nuova station was hit and all departures of electric trains toVarese and other centres were stopped. In addition, the goods yard station and customs house of Scalo Farini were hit. Two hotels near the main station, the bristol Schmid and the Touring, one of which had a light flak battery on the roof, were completely destroyed. It is reported that Isotta Fraschini, Bianchi,and Brown Boveri were amongst the factories damaged.23. There is as yet no evidence of large areas devastated by fire, whichconfirms previous experience that Italian cities, though capable of being burnedon a large scale eventually, are less readily combustible than those of Germany.A plot of night photographs taken during the raid is attached.Occupied France.Lorient.24. Nine attacks were launched by night against this U-boat base, involvingover 1,900 sorties and 4,286 tons of bombs. The town is virtually devastated,and the damage to the docks is heavy and widespread. Photographs and aC.I.U. damage plot are attached.Day Raids.Occupied Territory.Hengelo.25. The following damage has been caused by daylight raids onthe 23rd October, 1942 and the 20th January, 1943 :  .(i) Stork Engineering and Diesel Works. The diesel motor store has been hit and seriously damaged; the boiler-shops and N.V.G. Dikkers Co.fitting works have also been hit.(ii) The Haxemeyer Electrical and Mechanical Equipment Factory (N.W.of   the  Stork  Factory).-:Thi&amp;  factory  has  also  been  damaged.A photograph taken during the raid on the 20th January is attached.[25202] B 2
Morlaix (29th January).26. Photographs show that the viaduct received at least two direct hits inthe daylight raid on the 29th January, and was still out of use, at the end ofFebruary. The tracks have been removed for a distance of 530 ft. (i.e., over two-thirds of the total length), at the eastern end. There is a hole, or excavation,in the permanent way at one point, and the heaps of earth and general appearancesuggest that repairs are in progress. It is possible that the base of the first pierat the East end has also received a direct hit.Caen (10th February).27. Photographs taken during the attack on the 10th February showed atleast 16 bomb bursts on the western half of the marshalling yard, includingat least two direct hits on engine sheds, and several across the east part of the passenger station and goods depot. Bombs have also burst on the carriage-ways of the main roads to the south of the marshalling yard, and there are a few hitson industrial buildings on the south side of the river.Tours (18th February).28. Photographs taken during the attack on the 18th February showed thatthe majority of the bombs dropped burst on and around the railway workshopsnorth-west of the St. Pierre des Corps Sorting sidings. Many direct hits can beseen on railway workshop buildings, including one bomb exploding inside a longworkshop. The whole area is enveloped in dense clouds of smoke with one columnrising to a considerable height.Den Helder (19th February).29. Photographs taken during the attack on the 19th February showed atleast 23 bomb bursts in the dock area. There are several bursts on the torpedoworkshops east of the southern entrance to the Naval Basin, one on a large shedof the Torpedo-Boat establishment, and one burst in the. Inner Hafen (Naval)verv near to the floating dock.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, March 22, 1943.
