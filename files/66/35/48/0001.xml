THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1943.MOST SECRET.Copy No.    \ r(W.P. (43) 148.April 14, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOOK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.BRITISH UNION.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I circulate herewith, for the confidential information of my colleagues, a note which I have bad prepared summarising the information available about the british union, with particular reference to its activities since the outbreak of the war.I think that this will be of interest as a counterpart to my recent memorandumOil the Communist Party of Great Britain (W.P. (43) 109).The Vvrar Cabinet may wish to consider whether, with suitable modifications,these memoranda should be published. There is much to be said for publication,but I recognise that there may well be objections.THIS organisation was founded by Sir Oswald Mosley (6th Baronet) in.1932 with the name of British Union of Fascists. In June 1938 the words &quot; and national Socialists &quot; were added to the title, no doubt as the result of increasedGerman influence.&apos; In November 1937 all the last words in the title were dropped.The rules then stated that &quot; the name of the movement is the British Union andthe faith of the movement is the National Socialist and Fascist creed.&quot;The objects of the movement as proclaimed in its publications were first tosecure, by General Election base&quot; upon the existing franchise, a parliamentarymajority, and then to pass.a Cneral Powers Bill conferring on the FascistGovernment the right to take action by administrative decrees. Parliament wasto be retained, but future parliaments were to be elected on an occupational andnot on a geographical franchise. *&apos; The leadership principle &apos;&apos; was to be adoptedin every department of national and local life, and by drastic action oil the partof the Fascist government in dealing with existing institutions such as the Houseof Lords, the House of Commons, the Press and. local authorities, large powers were to be concentrated in the hands of the Government. Mosley, like &quot;Mussoliniand Hitler, was to have, and took upon himself, the title of &quot;Leader.&quot;H. M.Rome Office, April 14, 1943.-BKlTlSH UNION.;2528s;b
Foreign A ssociaMons and Finances.2. Although the spokesmen of the British Union were at pains to representthat their Fascist creed was to-be given a British character, they nevertheless-closely followed those methods of political persuasion which were first devolped in Italy and later perfected in Germany. In the matter of uniforms, in thedramatisation of the Leader&apos;s appearance at public meetings, in their choice ofthe Jews, financiers, and Communists as their- antagonists, and in the provoca:-tive and often violent methods of dealing with such antagonists, the Party&apos;sorganisers closely followed their Axis models. *Originally the British Union adopted as a uniform the black shirt of theItalian Fascists, the members greeted each other with the Fascist salute andtheir emblem was the Fascist bundle of rods and axe. In December 1935 a uniform similar to that of the German SS was adopted and the &apos;&apos; flash in thecircle&quot; was substituted for the Italian fasces as the emblem of the movement.Furthermore, the leaders of the British Union, who claimed to be representingwhat was truly British and made much of the words &quot; Britain First &quot; in theirpropaganda, were able completely to identify the interests of this country withthose of Italy and Germany, even when (as in the question of the return of herformer colonies to Germany) it is difficult to reconcile their words with thenational side of their National Socialist creed.3. At the time when the British Union was banned there was reason for believing that it had at certain periods been largely financed from foreignsources. According to the audited accounts of the British Union the income inthe two years from February 1934 to February 1936 was shown as  160,500. Asa result of the investigation of various banking accounts, which was made afterthe detention of Sir Oswald Mosley in 1940, it appears that the funds of theBritish Union for these years consisted chiefly of moneys which were paid intoa secret account in the names of two of its members. The greater part of the sums paid into this secret account consisted (a) of the proceeds of foreigncurrencies (Swiss francs, French francs, United States dollars and Reichsmarks),and (b) of remittances from foreign sources, which were further concealed by being-passed from a Swiss bank into the account of an individual in this country before they reached the secret account.It is evident that elaborate steps were taken to shroud the financial arrangements of the British Union in mystery. No support has been found,however, for the explanation given by certain members of the British Union thatthe only object in resorting to these methods was to oblige influential Britishsupporters, who desired to preserve their anonymity and who happened to haveforeign banking accounts, which they used to provide these very liberalsubscriptions. Although it is impossible, in view of the steps which have beentaken to conceal it, to obtain conclusive proof of the origin of these funds, theinference to be drawn from examination of the various banking accounts, togetherwith other evidence, is that Mosley received large sums of money from the ItalianGovernment in the early days of his movement. Evidence that similar financial aid was received from the German Government is less conclusive, and dependsonly on the statements of certain members of the British Union who -were in aposition to know.4. In April 1933 Sir Oswald Mosley, with a bodyguard of followers, paid a ceremonial visit to Mussolini and, wearing the Union black-shirt uniform,reviewed Italian Fascists. black shirt, which was then the organ of the Union,had a leading article entitled : &quot; The Immense Majesty of Fascist Peace.&quot; Inthis article it was said : &quot; Our deep and abiding friendship with the Fascist movement of Italy is based on the solemn root of friendship between men who hold in commona Fascist conception and a great ideal. Such friendship raises no questionof subordination but only a question of common service to a common cause.Our movement in Britain retains its British independence, its Britishmethods and national character, which is the essence of Fascist doctrine.At the same time we shall certainly confer with other Fascist movementsconcerning the advance of universal Fascism throughout the world.&quot;- 5. When in the Summer of 1935 tension developed between this countryand Italy over the question of Abyssinia, the British Union supported the Italianclaims. black shirt contained such headlines as &quot;Backward Nations cannot have freedom to practise atrocities.&quot;    Leaflets were issued containing such
phrases as &quot; Not one drop of blood shall be spent except in defence of Britain,&quot;&quot;The Lion of Judah is in Danger. .... The Men who would not fight for britain want You to fight for Abyssinia.&quot; Sir Oswald Mosley, speaking at public meetings, urged that Abyssinia was the aggressor.Anti-Semitism.6. From 1934 (by which time the National Socialist Party in Germany had come into power and had shown that it was likely to be successful) the british union adopted a strong anti-Jewish policy. At a meeting at the Albert Hallin October 1934 Sir Oswald Mosley said : &quot; We say to the alien race that rises against us to rob us of our heritage :&apos; We take up the challenge and deal with it.   They shall have it.&apos; &quot;In the Autumn of 1936^ there were disorders from time to time in theEast End as a result of British Union meetings and marches in which anti-Jewish propaganda was prominent. The Union made the most of these disorders.black shirt for the 17th October, 1936, said: &quot;The Jews and Reds of EastLondon, in their supreme folly, had tried to unloose mob law against the Britishof East London on the 4th October.&quot;7. By this time the British Union methods of marching their uniformedfollowers in military formation had created a risk that the British Union might produce something in the nature of a private army ready to obtain its politicalobjects by force or a show of force. To prevent this danger the Public Order act of 1936 was passed prohibiting political uniforms and the use for politicalpurposes of quasi-military organisations.Pro-Nazi: The Berlin Marriage.8. At a meeting at the Albert Hall in March 1936 Sir Oswald Mosley,after emphasising the importance of friendship between Britain and Germany,said that the British approval of the Franco-Soviet Pact had made the thendangerous situation inevitable. He went on : &quot; We find the decadent countries of France and Britain doing what systems of decadence have done all throughhistory : fearing the more virile systems of their contemporaries, and inviting the barbarians within their gates &apos;to defend them.&quot; The Germans were ourblood-brothers and the main bulwark of Europe against Bolshevism. During thecourse of this speech, with references to influences attempting to drag us into an alliance with France and Russia, he said : &apos;&apos; We will, not be bound by their(i.e., the politicians) treaties or betrayals. If they make, an alliance with Franceand Russia, then Fascism in power will repudiate that alliance.&quot; The speechended with an attack on the Jews.From this time on the British Union propaganda included much support forthe policy of the German Government. The Union&apos;s marching song was sung tothe tune of the Nazi marching song, the &quot; Horst Wessel Lied,&quot; at meetings and marches.In October 1936 Sir Oswald Mosley was married to the Hon. Diana Ouinness,the daughter of Lord Redesdale, in Berlin in the presence of Dr. Goebbels andand Hitler. Lady Mosley is the sister of Miss Unity Mitford, who is notoriouslyan admirer of Hitler and Nazi Germany. This was one of many contacts, social and political, between prominent members of the Union and persons high in the nazi hierarchy.In July 1937 some London members of the British Union went for a tour inGermany and were welcomed by Julius Streicher in Nuremberg. Streicher (as reported in the Times of the 29th July, 1937) said :-&quot; You have a leader who has had the courage to go out into the streetsand fight for his cause in public. Our hearts are with anyone who has suchcourage and risks his life for his convictions. .... Why is it that theEnglish nation still declines to stretch out its hand to Germany&apos;?- Therecan only be one answer. If the English people knew the truth, it would offerits hand to Germany. But in England the Jews and Jewish money have very much to say. For this reason and this will be my conviction to mydying day the fight against the Jew can never stop. In this sense I consideryou as comrades and brothers in the fight. We have only one common enemy,and that is the Jew.   We must conquer him.&quot;tfv .- [25288] b 2
In 1938 an agreement, never put into effect, was entered into between sir Oswald Mosley and the German authorities for the establishment in germany at German expense of a radio station, which was to be handed over jto a company *of which Sir Oswald Mosley and another member of the British Union closely connected with its finances were the principal shareholders.For the Rape of Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland.9. Austria was invaded on the 13th March, 1938, and in the 19th March issueof. Action (a British Union organ) there was a leading article under the headline :&apos;&apos; Stop this War.&apos;&apos; It read : &apos;&apos; Fellow Britons ! Unless you wake up now, millions of you will never wake again. The politicians are using every effort to send, youinto the slaughterhouse of another European War. In whose quarrel ? The quarrelof the politicians, backed by International Capitalism and International Socialism,marching hand in hand to attempt the destruction of Germany with preciousBritish lives. Not one British interest is involved in Austria. At this very hourmillions of Austrians rejoice because Hitler has brought about their union in thenew brotherhood of the. German people.&quot; Another page in the same issuecontained the headline : &quot;St. Gollancz for Merrie Austria. Jewish Hullabalooin London.   While Vienna Colleagues bolt with the Loot.&quot;On the 23rd March, 1938, Sir Oswald Mosley addressed a public meeting in the following words : &quot; Is it possible to be friendly with the new Germany ?Many people think that Hitler&apos;s Germany is the Kaiser&apos;s Germany once again.That is a crass view to take. To-day it is a different country from 1914. Thesystem of the Kaiser was a system of export capitalism supported by Judaicfinance .... Germany no longer desires a world empire, she wants instead theunion of all Germans within the Reich in Europe. Our mission and Germany&apos;s,far from being in conflict, are complementary. Germany is the bulwark againstCommunism in Europe, Britain the bulwark overseas.&quot;Subsequently the British Union defended the German aggression againstCzechoslovakia at the time of the Munich crisis. Leaflets were issued with suchslogans as &quot; War ! For Czechoslovakia. Do you want it ? The Parties Do ....Stop War and Secret Alliances,&quot; and &quot; Stop this War! Britons Unite, tell theGovernment, we will not fight for Czechoslovakia.&quot; Sir Oswald. Mosley wrotean article in A ction, which was then the organ of the British Union, headed :&quot; Stop Czech Nonsense.&quot; The article began by saying : &quot; The peace of the worldis threatened by Czechoslovakia.&quot; No action of the German Government was criticised.Subsequently, when Hitler occupied Prague, Action published a front-pagearticle by Mosley under the head-line &quot; Warmongers Exposed,&quot; beginning withthe words : &quot; The jackals of Jewish fianance are again in full cry for war.&quot; the writer goes on to say : &apos;&apos; Disruption and disorder broke out on German bordersnecessitating exactly the same intervention of the nearest strong and stable power,which all the world over has occasioned similar intervention by Great Britain,when disruption and disorder has proceeded, far enough to be a threat to life and civilisation.&quot;Later the British Union supported the German attack on Poland. There was an article in A ction for the 2nd September, 1939, under the title &apos;&apos; Atrocities in poland who is right?&quot; and the object of the article wars to show that theGerman Government was right. A pamphlet was published : &quot;No War forWarsaw. Will you die for Poles, Parties and finance, or unite in British union for Britons, Peace and People ? Finance has invested its money in Poland. Wehave invested our lives in Britain.&quot;In the publications of the British Union and the speeches of Sir oswald mosley there was never any word of condemnation of any of the actions of the nazi Government.British Union on the War.10. On the 1st September, 1939, Sir Oswald Mosley issued a document called&quot; Mosley&apos;s Message to all British Union Members.&quot; Inthis document Sir oswald mosley said : &quot; The Government of Britain goes to war, with the agreement of-all theParliamentary parties. British Union stands for peace. Neither Britainnor her Empire is threatened. Therefore British Government intervenesin an alien quarrel. In this situation we of British Union will do&quot; our utmost to persuade our British people to make peace.
&quot; Before war began, in our struggle for peace, our thousands of members had awakened great masses of the British people to demand peace. Butsufficient of the people could not be awakened in time without the money which we did not possess. The dope machine of Jewish finance deceivedthe people until Britain was involved in war in the interest of the MoneyPower which rules Britain through its press and parties. Now British union will continue our work of awakening the people until peace be won, and untilthe People&apos;s State of British Union is born by the declared will of the british people.&quot; To our members my message is plain and clear. Our country is involved in war. Therefore I ask you/to do nothing to injure our country, orto help any other Power. Our members should do what the law requires ofthem, and, if they are members of any of the Forces or Services of the Crown,they should obey their orders, and, in every particular, obey the rules of their service. But I ask all members who are free to carry on our work to take every opportunity within your power to awaken the people and to demandpeace.&quot; We enter now a period when the people will be aroused by events.When we have awakened sufficient of the people to the truth, peace will bewon and Britain and her people will be saved for a glorious future.&quot; To this mission I shall continue to devote my life. Nearly twenty-fiveyears ago, when I was barely eighteen years of age, I was flying over theGerman lines in the last war. Later I faced the Germany of the Kaiser inthe trenches.&quot; We have said a hundred times that if the life of Britain werethreatened we would fight again. But I am not offering to fight in the quarrelof Jewish finance, in a war from which Britain could withdraw at any moment she likes with her Empire intact and her people safe.&quot; For the moment I am not concerned to argue about the incidents which preceded the outbreak of war.   In time we shall know the whole truth.&quot; It is sufficient to say that a war cannot be fought every twenty years to prevent any remedy of the injustices in the Peace Treaty which concludedthe previous war.&quot; I am now concerned with only two simple facts. This war is no quarrelof the British people; this war is a quarrel of Jewish finance. So to our people I give myself for the winning of peace.&quot;In the succeeding weeks A ction contained numerous articles and para-graphs calculated to undermine public confidence in the war effort of the countryand to stir up hatred against the Jews. In the issue of the 23rd September therewas ah article by Sir Oswald Mosley entitled, &quot; Civilian Bombing,&quot; of whichthe object was to suggest that the British Government contemplated initiatingthe bombing of civilians.In an address to a meeting at Richmond on the 9th September, Sir oswald mosley suggested that a revolutionary situation would develop. in this countrywithin the next six or eight months. He argued that the war was a purelyJewish war, and that those who joined up or put on uniform were foolishlyfighting for those who would enslave them. He explained that the British union were not backing Germany against England, but backing the white man againstthe Jew, and that his policy in future would be as it has been in the past:&quot; Britain First.&quot;During the early months of the war leaflets were distributed by the british union which bore such/headlines as &quot; Stop this Jews&apos; War,&quot; and &quot; Conscript theJews, it&apos;s their War.&quot; Action contained many items calculated to undermineconfidence in our war effort, reports of increasing unemployment, alleged scandalsin connection with evacaution, articles emphasising Germany&apos;s invincibility anditems calculated to stir up hatred against the Jews. For instance, in the issuefor the 23rd September, 1939, there as such headlines as, &quot; Profiteering as badas last time,&quot; &quot;Jews flood Brighton,&quot; and &quot;Refugee Wealth.&quot;On the 15th October, 1939, Sir Oswald Mosley addressed a meeting at theStoll Theatre seeking to show the futility of the war. At this meeting therewas sung the marching song of the British Union to the tune of the HorstWessel Lied and an anti-Semitic parody on &quot; Onward Christian Soldiers.&quot; Onthe platform was a banner bearing the words &quot; Stop the War. Let the Peoplevote.&quot; t .The British Union set up a young men&apos;s advisory committee to assist tih^British Union adherents who wished to claim exemption from. miLxary service as
conscientious objectors, and in a circular letter sent from headquarters to the branches it was stated that &quot; those of us who are now free under the law todecide the matter for ourselves are not offering our services to fight in this war &apos;because we do not consider that Britain or her Empire is threatened.&quot;Norway and the Low Countries.11. When in 1940 the Germans invaded Norway, Action contained articlessuggesting that the German &apos;&apos; counter-move &apos;&apos; was necessitated by the Britishaction in violating Norway&apos;s neutrality. In the issue for the 11th April, 1940,Action said : &quot; It may turn out that this move of the British Government was an expensive means of purchasing the applause of a few more mugs to cry &apos; goodold Churchill, he at any rate is doing something .&quot; In the same issue, Actionsaid : &quot; We may not be very efficient but we are very righteous. Such, so far,has been the attitude of the Democracies of this war. Now, they have abandoned the mantle of righteousness, but have yet to provide any evidence that they have secured a substitute in efficiency. They have violated Norway&apos;s neutrality bymining her waters, but they have done this at a moment when it no longer appearsthat the mining of these waters will have the least effect upon Germany.&quot;When the Low Countries were invaded by the Germans there was nocriticism of their action in British Union publications. Action continued to advocate peace.Suppression of British Union: Operation of Defence Regulation 18B.12. In May 1940 the situation was such that it was no longer safe toallow the activities of the British Union to continue. The paying members ofthe British Union were estimated to &apos;number between 8,000 to 10,000 persons.They were organised on a geographical basis under district leaders, and in thewhole country there were 180-200 districts. Over these district leaders therewere district inspectors the country excluding London being divided for thispurpose into seven zones, each under an inspector.Although amongst the members of the British Union there were personswho had joined without any realisation that its policy involved disloyalty,most of them were imbued with the leadership conception and were preparedto follow the Leader blindly. There were examples of members putting their loyalty to the British Union before their other loyalties and several prosecutionsand convictions as a consequence. It was feared that that Leader might welcome the Germans as the forerunners of that &apos;&apos; advance of universal Fascism through-out the World &apos;&apos; to which reference is made in the quotation - in paragraph above, that, in fact, the British Union was the counterpart in this country of major Quisling&apos;s Norwegian Nasjonal Samling or the Dutch National Socialistparty under the leadership of that Mussert who was publicly thanked by Hitlerafter the successful German invasion of the Low Countries.The Government decided that it was necessary to bring the activities of theUnion to an end, and for this purpose to make use of the provisions of regulation 18b, authorising the internment of supporters of any organisationif the persons in control of such organisation &quot; have or have had associationswith persons concerned in the government of or sympathies with the system ofgovernment of any Power with which His Majesty is at war .... and there isdanger of the utilisation of the organisation for purposes prejudicial to thepublic safety, the defence of the realm, &amp;c.&quot; For the purpose of suppressingthe movement, it was necessary to detain not only the principal leaders, but also those who were district leaders or otherwise active and influential in the localbranches up and down the country. Altogether, 747 persons were detainedbecause of their association with the British Union.In July 1940 an order was also made under Defence Regulation 18a, making it an offence for any persons to attempt to carry on the activities of the british union.13. In the latter part of 1940 and the early part of 1941 the cases of those persons who had been interned were reviewed individually by the AdvisoryCommittee appointed under Regulation 18b. As a result, it was found that manyof them could be released without undue risk. Some of them were persons whohad been attracted by the patriotic slogans of the British Union and had not realised the danger that the Union might be used for the purpose of hinderingthe war effort. Many of them were found to be&apos;persons with no political know-ledge who had joined the Union because of personal grievances of various kinds.
At later dates the cases of many of those who had not been released as aresult of the first review were investigated again and further releases becamepossible having regard both to changes in the views of the individual concerned,and to the fact that, as the position of this country became progressively stronger,risks could be taken which would not have been justifiable at an earlier date.The number of persons detained because of their association with the british union has now been reduced to 130. Further examinations of these cases are still continuing with a view to further releases.Some Individual Cases.14. No evidence has been obtained showing that the British Union was atthe time it was banned engaged in the organisation of sabotage or espionage onbehalf of the enemy. Much evidence is, however, available about the effect on the minds of many former members of the propaganda of the Union in favour ofthe Italian and German systems of government and against our system ofgovernment, alleged to be one of corrupt financial democracy. There is evidencethat this led many members to commit breaches of laws and regulations designedto protect security; examples may be taken from the cases of members of theUnion convicted for such offences.When Claude Duvivier, an active member of the British Union, was chargedwith an offence under the Defence Regulations and sentenced to 6 months&apos;imprisonment at the beginning of 1940, a letter which he had written to hisassociate A. W. Crowle was read. The following passage occurred in it: &quot; now that about this Naval engagement in the South Atlantic. You must be specially interested, as I was. Of course, as usual, we shall never know the truth, as bothsides claim it as a victory, and, being a National Socialist, I prefer to believe the German version.&apos;&apos; The prosecution arose as the result of the discovery of aletter in Duvivier&apos;s possession which Duvivier intended to send to British Unionheadquarters, and which contained information relative to certain of HisMajesty&apos;s ships which Duvivier had obtained from Crowle. Although it couldnot be proved that either Duvivier or Crowle intended this information to be passed to the enemy, and although the British Union disowned them after theirconviction, the case illustrates not only the acceptance by the persons involved of enemy propaganda, but also the fact that persons possessing the Fascist ideologywere prepared to pass on secret information to the Fascist Party, to which theyowed allegiance.In May 1940 two members of the Portsmouth branch of the British Union,William Swift and Mrs. Ingram (a woman of German origin), were convicted forconspiring together to do acts likely to assist the enemy, and were sentenced to long terms of penal servitude. The charges arose out of an attempt of Swiftand Ingram to obtain secret information. According to the evidence for the prosecution, Mrs. Ingram had said that she knew how to get information toGermany and that &quot; Mosley and.Hitler are more like brothers.&quot;In a number of cases former members of the British Union have sought toavoid their obligations under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act. an example, is the case of one R. F. Stokes, who was a former member of the british union, and who until recently has been acting in a secretarial and administrativecapacity in the offices of the British National Party, a party of which furthermention will be made hereafter. This man was wanted for some time by thepolice as a result of his refusal to submit himself for medical examination priorto call-up for the armed forces. When he was at last apprehended he continuedto refuse, and was sentenced by the magistrate to twelve months&apos; imprisonment.On appearance in the police court he made no concealment of his Fascist faith.There are also cases of former members of the British Union who have been released from detention on the representation that they would serve in the armed forces, but who have subsequently gone back on their word in this respect. Forexample, S. H. E. Martin demanded before the Advisory Committee that &quot;as aBritish man I be given the right to fight for my country in its hour of need,&quot;but, after his release, he did not register for over a year, and ultimately did soas a conscientious objector; G. E. Parry said that if he were released he would withdraw his name from the Register of Conscientious Objectors, and would be willing to do his duty to his King and Country, but, when released in December1940, he failed to register at all until February 1941, when he did. so as aconscientious objector; C. C. Hoar stated that since the collapse of France hehad changed his views and was prepared to fight in any part of the world, but,when served with an enlistment notice in July 1941, failed to report and has since evaded arrest.   There are other similar cases.
A ttempts at Resuscitation.15. The action taken to ban the British Union and detain its leading members effectively destroyed it as an organised political party. There is no evidence that it has been able to continue any organised existence underground.Attempts have been made, chiefly in London, to resuscitate it, but these attemptshave been unsuccessful in the formation of anything other than local and isolatedgroups. The reasons are that Fascist sympathisers have been unable to findresolute, resourceful leaders among those Fascist leaders now at liberty, and therisk of detention under D.R. 18b is regarded as very real, and only the-boldestare prepared to run it. There has also been disagreement among Fascistsympathisers on matters of policy, chiefly on the question whether national socialist Germany is to be regarded, as a friend or an enemy.Organisations such as the 18b Detainees (British) Aid Fund, which hasostensi bly charities table objects, and the 18b Publicity Council, which seeks to makepropaganda against the Regulation, are controlled by former British union members, and, although legal, serve to keep such members in touch with eachother, and may also serve as a nucleus for a political party until the ban on theBritish Union is raised. The British National Party, although it has attracteda number of supporters from among former members of the British Union, in itspublic professions repudiates any connexion with the Union; its organiser,Edward Godfrey, will not admit Sir Oswald Mosley&apos;s leadership.
