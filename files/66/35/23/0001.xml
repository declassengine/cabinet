THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1943.SECEETW.P. (43) 123.March 25, 1943.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 1943 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES and mandated  TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.CANADA is giving increasing attention to the political and social questionswhich will arise in connexion with any post-war settlement. The Stettiniusreport on the Lease-Lend arrangements has been given wide publicity, and has ledto renewed discussion of the arrangements. In this connexion it has been pointedout that Great Britain is doing everything in her power to maintain reciprocity;for example, by supplying the United States forces in the United Kingdom. TheCanadian Government&apos;s mutual aid proposals have been warmly welcomed, andit is thought, with satisfaction, that the Allocations Board is significant ofCanada&apos;s prestige. Articles in the press on the subject of food supplies indicateCanada&apos;s willingness to make further sacrifices to provide food for Britain.2. In the Canadian House of Commons, the Government gained a con-spicuous success on the 23rd February, when an amendment moved by Mr. Cardin,a former Quebec Cabinet Minister, to suspend the Conscription Bill pending thereport of the Committee studying man-power, was defeated by 195 votes to 15.This is taken to be an overwhelming vote of confidence in Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;sGovernment.3. Mr. Hanson has been succeeded by Mr. G. Graydon as Acting Leader ofthe Opposition.4. The reference by M. Godbout, the Premier of Quebec,. to the possiblecession of Labrador to Quebec Province received wide publicity.5. The announcement that the number of R.C.A.F. squadrons in the UnitedKingdom was to be increased from 25 to 38 was welcomed.Naval, military and air activities.6. H.M.C. Corvette Louisburg was sunk by aircraft attack in the Mediter-ranean on the 6th; three officers and 47 ratings were rescued.7. On the 13th, a U-boat was probably sunk off Oran by H.M.C. CorvetteWoodstock in co-operation with two mine-sweeping trawlers and United Statesfighter aircraft.8.. H.M.C. Corvette Weyburn was sunk by mine off Gibraltar on the 23rdwhen escorting a homeward convoy from North Africa.9. The number of R.C.A.F. squadrons operational in the United Kingdomand overseas remained the same as in January, but the operational flying time inthe United Kingdom showed an increase of nearly 75 per cent., mainly due1 to the copy No.
increased activity of the Canadian bombing squadrons. No. 6 (R.C.A.F.) BomberGroup gave an excellent performance with practically all its medium and heavy bomber squadrons operating continuously to full capacity; two of the latterexceeded 800 hours operational flying during the month.10. Fighter squadrons were also busy, particularly in numerous operationsas escort to bombers and carrying out interception patrols.11. During the month&apos;s operations, eight fighters and 23 bombers were reported missing.Economic and Financial.12. The Bills providing for further financial assistance to the UnitedKingdom and other members of the United Nations are still before the CanadianHouse of Commons.13. In the meantime, a draft Agreement has been prepared and is underdiscussion in Ottawa providing for the sale to the Canadian Government of the fixed capital assets owned by the United Kingdom Government in munitionsfactories in Canada. The Canadian Government intend to adopt a verygenerous course of purchasing these assets at their full original cost to the UnitedKingdom Government. It is expected that, on this basis, the total price will be over 200 million dollars.14. The establishment of the Canadian War Supplies Allocation Board will involve a considerable number of changes in the procedure by which orders and contracts are placed in Canada. There may also arise the question of the relation-ship of this Board to the Combined Boards and to other bodies concerned in theallocation and assignment of war supplies and food-stuffs.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.15. Although the discussion of the possibility of Japanese attacks onAustralia continues, recent air and naval successes have brought about a feeling of hopefulness with regard to the war in the Pacific, and the evacuation ofGuadalcanar by the Japanese was thought to be the prelude to further importantmoves in the Allies&apos; favour. Australians are still of the opinion that a&quot; holding &quot; war against the Japanese is not enough, and the time for a majorassault on Japan itself is eagerly awaited. Warnings have appeared in the press that short cuts to peace with Germany and Japan are illusory.16. The suggestions made in certain United States quarters of the need for permanent bases in the Pacific after the war has been viewed somewhat askancein Australia, where it has been remarked that this represents the first territorialclaim made by any of the United Nations, with the exception of Russia.17. In home affairs the Militia Bill continues to provoke discussion. At its second reading the Bill was almost universally condemned by the press. Thefeeling was expressed that Australia made a poor showing by placing limits tothe areas to which the militia may be sent, both Government and Opposition being-held to be responsible for this. The Opposition decision not to oppose the Billcame in for severe censure, and the action of Mr. Menzies and Mr. Spender (whoresigned in protest against this decision) has undoubtedly enhanced their personalprestige.18. The supplementary Commonwealth Budget was generally welcomed.The broadening of the tax field is considered its most satisfactory feature, butthere has been fierce opposition to the new taxation among the lower income groups.19. A Bill to establish a National Welfare Fund Australia^ &quot; BeveridgePlan &quot;-was introduced by Mr. Chifley, the Commonwealth Treasurer, in theHouse of Representatives on the 12th February. In his introductory speech hesaid that Australia&apos;s post-war aim must be the physical development of thecountry, linked up with increased production and an increased population.  .20. A, Bill is shortly to be introduced providing a 25 per cent, increase inArmy pensions.21. It. has been stated that 700,000 Australians are now under arms, and since February 1942, 500,000 men and women have been diverted to war work.
22. The Cabinet have approved legislation to give the vote to all membersof the Australian Forces, irrespective of age, or whether they are seiwing at home or abroad.23. Mr. Curtin announced in the House of Representatives that Dr. Evatt,the Minister for External Affairs, will shortly pay another visit to washington and London.Naval, Military and Air Activities.24. H.M.A.S. Gascoyne, the first river-class corvette, was launched onthe 20th.25. The 9th Australian Division, returning from active service in theMiddle East, arrived at Fremantle on the 18th.26. As the result of reorganisation, armoured formations in Australia will consist of the following: 1st and 3rd Australian Armoured Divisions,4th Australian Armoured Brigade Group and 3rd Army Tank Brigade. The2nd Australian Motor Division will be dispersed and used in forming the4th Australian Armoured Brigade Group and strengthening the 1st and3rd Australian Armoured Divisions, in particular by providing them each withan additional motor regiment. The 4th Australian Armoured Brigade group is being raised as a composite armoured formation consisting of one regimentof medium tanks, one regiment of light tanks and one infantry tank battalion,together with ancillary units.27. At the end of January United States forces in Australia numbered137,156, of which 95,785 are ground troops.NEW ZEALAND.28. The Chicago Tribune suggestion that New Zealand and Australiashould join the. United States aroused both ridicule and resentment. As regardsthe suggestions that the United States desire to retain bases in the Pacific, NewZealand opinion was that, while negotiations for developing these bases could probably be completed without undue difficulty, the retention of all the islandsoccupied by the United States would be quite a different matter.29. The Government was much heartened by its success at the Christchurchby-election. At the opening of the new parliamentary session, on the24th February, the Prime Minister gave notice of his intention to move that, inview of the continued improvement in the war situation, a general election shouldbe held in New Zealand not later than the 1st November. Earlier in the monthhe expressed the view that, subject to one reservation (viz:., the possibility of aserious reverse in the Pacific), the New Zealand Division should stay in theMiddle East, &apos;&apos; where it can be most effectively used in the struggle for democracyand freedom.&quot; The leader of the Opposition, in a speech at Christchurch, wentfurther and attacked the Government for talking of withdrawing the troops fromthe Middle East &quot; where they are so well trained to serve,&quot; and sending them toa &quot; disease-infested jdngle battle-ground, of which they have no experience.&quot;30. New Zealand export figures for 1942 reached the record figure of nearly - 81,000,000. :      &apos;Naval, Military and Air Activities.31. H.M.N.Z.S. Achilles was operating with a United States task force inthe South-West Pacific area and then left for the United Kingdom- for refitting.H.M.N.Z.S. Leander is refitting at Auckland&apos;.32. Proposals for reduction in the strength of the mobilised forces havenow been agreed, and 3,208 men were released from the army to industry duringthe month. A man-power survey has just been completed with &apos; a view, toadjusting personnel (a) within the army, (b) between the army and the air force,(c) between the army and industry.33. The operational strength of the Royal New Zealand Air Force at theend of this year is likely to be seventeen to eighteen squadrons, of which it isproposed that as many as possible should be employed for offensive operations inthe forward areas.
UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.34. In the by-election at Barberton, caused by the resignation of ColonelDeneys Reitz on his appointment as Union High Commissioner in the UnitedKingdom, the seat has been retained by General Smuts&apos;s party, with an increasedmajority.35. The inevitability of a general election this year is now accepted by all parties, although the Government has not yet formally committed itself. Withthis in view, the Opposition, led by Dr. Malan, is turning its attentionincreasingly to post-war problems. But increasing dissatisfaction is being shownwith the leadership of Dr. Malan, who was ill at ease in the debate on his social security motion, and there is speculation about his possible displacement byMr. Bermer, who has specialised on social welfare matters.36. The &quot; Ossewa Brandwag&quot; has announced that it will not nominatecandidates in the event of a general election, but will support any anti-war and anti-Empire candidate &quot; who found his enemies in the Empire, and not amonghis fellow-Afrikaners.&quot; The Malanite Nationalist party, however, fears that&quot; Ossewag Brandwag &quot; may put up independent candidates who will split theOpposition vote. &quot; Ossewa Brandwag &quot; is now the only section of South african opinion which is openly in favour of a German victory, Van Rensburg, its leader,stating recently that &apos;&apos; a Bolshevik victory would mean the end of nationalismand Christianity throughout the world.&quot; The prospect of a general electionseems to be bringing about the disintegration of the Afrikaner party, for two members of this small group have recently resigned and have joined Field-Marshal Smuts, as they now believe that the Government should be supportedin the prosecution of the war. Dr. Malan&apos;s newspaper, Die Burger, appealed tothe party to merge itself with the Nationalists.37. There is much dissatisfaction with Mr. Madeley&apos;s leadership of theLabour&apos; party, and some talk of putting up Left Wing Independent candidatesagainst the official Labour candidates.38. The ground has been prepared for the exploitation of racial fears andprejudices, by an anti-Communist motion brought forward, in the House of assembly by Mr. Eric Louw, a member of the Nationalist party, and it is believedthat the Nationalists are preparing to issue a &quot; Black Manifesto &quot; similar to thatwith which they stampeded the electorate in 1929.39. The Government has set up a commission under Mr. Justice Landsdownto examine the report on the remuneration and conditions of employment ofnatives working in the Witwatersrand gold mines.40. Mr. Hofmeyr&apos;s budget is on conservative lines; he has postponed makingfinancial provision for any social security scheme, despite the widespread desire for this throughout the Union, and the direct taxpayer in South Africa still getsoff very lightly, and little is being done to curtail private expenditure on luxuries,or to encourage, still less to enforce, private saving.41. The Prime Minister won a notable victory in the House of Assemblywhen his &quot; Overseas Service &quot; motion, to permit South African troops to serve intheatres of war outside Africa, was passed by 75 votes to 49.42.   There has been some further minor acts of sabotage on the Rand.NEWFOUNDLAND.43. The arrival in North Africa during February of the 166th NewfoundlandField Regiment, Royal Artillery, has been reported. This is one of the twoNewfoundland regiments that have been training in this country as part of theUnited Kingdom forces.44. Operations at the iron-ore mines at Bell Island, which employ about1,700 men, have been suspended until further notice. The decision was takenmainly on account of shipping difficulties, as a result of which stocks of ore havebeen accumulating, even though the mines have only been working recently on three days a week. The position is, however, complicated by the fact that theminers have slowed down work, apparently as a protest against the three day week, and, have also presented new wage demands. The Newfoundland Govern-ment are investigating the situation in consultation with both sides.
i fi vJL V OINDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.48. The outstanding event of the month, measured by its aH-absorbinginterest for the Indian public, was the 21 days&apos; fast which Mr. Gandhi beganon the 10th February. The circumstances which immediately led to it were made known by the publication on that date both of the complete correspondenceexchanged between Mr. Gandhi and the Viceroy in the preceding weeks and ofa full statement of the Government of India&apos;s attitude towards the threatened,fast. Mr. Gandhi began the correspondence by inviting the Viceroy to convincehim of the responsibility of himself and Congress for the outrages of last autumn;but before the correspondence closed it transpired, that nothing but his un-conditional release would divert him from his fast. The Government of Indiamade it clear that the threat would not deflect them from their policy; they wereprepared to release him for the duration of his fast, but if he chose to fast while in detention the responsibility was entirely on his shoulders.49. At the outset public excitement was less than might have been expected:apparently it was thought that the Government of India would give way. Atthe end of the first week the Viceroy&apos;s acceptance of the resignations of oneParsi and two Hindu members of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council who could nolonger support the Governments policy, left no doubt that the Government meant to stand firm. Interest in the fast increased, with the daily issue of bulletins on mr. Gandhi&apos;s health, especially when after ten days these announced a crisis in hiscondition.   A conference of some 200 political leaders but not including45. Replying to a Debate in the Dail on the 18th February on a Motion putforward by Alderman Byrne and Mr. Cole, two Independent members, that itwould not be in Eire&apos;s best interests to hold a General Election during theemergency, Mr. de Valera said that there had never been any suggestion fromthe Government of a desire to prolong the life of Parliament. They believed thatif the danger was sufficiently imminent, the Opposition parties would recogniseit sufficiently to say to the Government that there ought not to be an Election. he believed that the war would last for a considerable time. If they avoided an election now they would be forced into it before the emergency ended and at atime when the dangers would be greater. He did not believe a Coalition or national Government would prove a success at present. With a National Govern-ment they would have to try to compose party views and they would have to havecompromises all the way through. If there was to be any co-operation betweenparties it was best carried out in open Parliament. Owing to a variety of difficulties, Mr. de Valera thought that an early Election was not likely. Itwould be as near to June, when they had legally to disappear, as they could resonably manage.  There was no question of rushing the Election.46. Speaking in the Dail, Mr. Aiken, the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefensive Measures, said that it was proposed to continue the practice ofcensoring all matter prejudicial to the public safety and the preservation of theState, whether contained, in press reports or otherwise or whether in favour of neutrality or of participation in the war. This statement was made in replyto Mr. Dillon who asked if it was intended to suppress press reports on any discussion of the expediency or propriety of Irish neutrality in the war duringthe Election campaign.47. Mr. de Valera during February made two speeches on the position offood supplies in Eire. Speaking to County Dublin farmers on the 1st February,he said that one of the Government&apos;s greatest preoccupations since the war beganwas to try to ensure that Eire would have all the food she required. He asked the farmers of County Dublin to make special efforts to do more than their share in providing the extra 12,500 acres of wheat that were needed. There was a danger that people would say because they exported a surplus of food products-that there was no danger of a serious food shortage. Those who talked, like thatforgot transport difficulties and a host of other matters.
Mr. Jinnah was held in Delhi and, adopted a resolution which was sent to theViceroy and the Prime Minister, urging the immediate release of Mr. Gandhi.The Viceroy replied through his Private Secretary on the 21st February that no new factor had emerged since the issue of the Government of India&apos;s statement on the 10th February and that the decision to bring the fast to an end restedsolely with Mr. Gandhi. The Prime Minister, replying on the 24th February,similarly emphasised that the responsibility rested entirely with Mr. Gandhi and stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government endorsed the determination of theGovernment of India not to be deflected from their duty towards the peoples of India and of the United Nations by Mr. Gandhi&apos;s attempt to secure hisunconditional release by fasting.50. Mr. Gandhi survived the crisis and subsequent bulletins reported,improvement in his condition (attributable, at least in part, to the doctors&apos; care).Increased expectation that he would survive the fast helped to relax the emotionaltension felt by most Indians. There was a fairly general feeling thatMr. Gandhi&apos;s case against the Government was a weak one, but, as a pro-Government Hindu said, &quot; Logic is all against Mr. gandhis release butHindu sentiment is entirely for it.&quot; Moslems, though apparently in generalopposed to his release, were unwilling to say so openly. Only the British-ownedpress condemned unequivocally the resort to fasting as a political weapon.51. It is impossible to foresee the effect of the fast on the political situationbut it certainly contributed nothing during February to furthering co-operationbetween Moslems and Hindus. With the exception of persistent lawlessness in parts of Bombay and Bengal the country generally has been peaceful. Apart from some short-lived, strikes, notably in Ahmedabad and Bombay mills, such publicagitation as there was for Mr. Gandhi&apos;s release did not cause any anxiety tothe authorities.52. Opinion on the war showed a tendency to confidence and evencomplacency in view of the Russian achievements.Indian States.53. The reaction to Mr. Gandhi&apos;s fast was confined to the closing of millsin Baroda, some partial hartals (suspension of business) and strikes by students.Cases of arson and sabotage continue to occur, particularly in the Deccan States.Economic difficulties still cause widespread concern.External and Frontier Relations.54. Afghanistan. The dispute over the question of the sale of Afghanraisins, referred to in last month&apos;s report, was settled satisfactorily, though theGovernment of India had to pay a high price for the raisins and to deal solelywith the Afghan monopoly companies over the transaction to the exclusion of theIndian traders.55. North- West Frontier. Efforts by the Faqir of Ipi to create disturbances in Waziristan met with little support from the tribes, though there was sometrouble with a section of the Madda Khel. In spite of continued anxiety in regardto the rise in prices and food shortages, the frontier remained comparativelytranquil. Nearly all the 120 Mahsud deserters from the Mechanical transport had returned to duty by the end of the month.  .56. Tibet. No further developments were reported in regard to thenegotiations for the trans-Tibet pack route for supplies to China.57. China. -The visit of a Chinese Educational Mission to India, whichhad to be postponed last autumn owing to the political situation, has now been definitely arranged. The mission, under Dr. Y. H. Ku, the Vice-Minister ofEducation, was due to arrive at Delhi on the 1st March and to make a six weeks&apos;visit, including an extensive tour of cultural and educational centres in India.58. The Government of India reported their intention to start discussions with the Chinese Commissioner on the subject of the Leh-Karakoram pack route to China.,59. The Persian Gulf. Lively interest was taken in the Casablancameetings and the Prime Minister&apos;s visit to Turkey. Optimism was maintained by the continued Allied successes, but there was anxiety about the local food situation.
Finance.60. Indian Budget. The budget for 1943-44 was introduced in theLegislative Assembly on,&apos;the &quot;27th February.   The main figures are as follows : revised estimate, Budget,1942-43. 1943-44-  millions.   millions.Revenue        ...      ...      ...          134-1 149-5Expenditure out of revenue *Civil......   62&quot;&apos;8- 57-6Defence   ...... 142-3 137-1- -         205-1 -         194-7Deficit ...      ...      ...      ... 71 0 45-2** On the basis of existing taxation.61. Income Tax and Corporation Tax in 1943-44 show improvements of 9^ millions and  14 millions, respectively, over the Budget estimates for1942-43.62. Out of the proceeds of income tax the Provinces will receive 8 millions in 1942-43, and it is estimated that in 1943-44 the Provincial sharewill be  9 millions. The Governor-General again exercised the emergencypower conferred on him by the Government of India Act to suspend for anotheryear the reduction that would otherwise have taken place in the sum to be retained by the Central Government out of the income tax proceeds.63. The Railway contribution to general revenues is estimated at  15-1millions in 1942-43 and  20 - 3 millions in 1943-44.64. Defence expenditure by the Government of India is now estimatedat  179 millions in 1942-43, an increase of  79 millions on the budget estimate for that year.  142 millions is charged to revenue and  37 millions to capital account. The latter sum includes expenditure on aerodromes, capital outlayon industrial expansion, new naval construction, and capital outlay on the telecommunications scheme. .65. In 1943-44 Defence expenditure is estimated at nearly  150 millions,of which  137 millions is on revenue account and over  12^ millions on capital account.66. The deficit in 1942-43 was being met by borrowing. About one-thirdof the estimated deficit of  45J millions in 1943-44 would be met by additionaltarnation.67. Increases are proposed in the rates of tax on incomes above  375 ayear, the effect of which would be to replace the existing unequal surchargesby a uniform surcharge of 66f per cent, over the basic rates of tax&quot; (i.e., overthe rates imposed in March 1939). A small uniform increase in the surcharge on super-tax is proposed. Corporation tax is to be raised from 1^ annas in therupee ^ls^lO^d. in the  ) to 2 annas in the rupee ^2s. 6^. in the  ). these increases would yield about  5J millions.68. Two new indirect taxes are proposed: (i) an excise duty on tobaccocalculated to increase the retail price by about 20 per cent, for all grades, and(ii) an excise duty of 10s. Q\d. per cwt. on vegetable ghee (the Indian form of margarine). The new excise duties would yield  7f millions and  1 million respectively. .69. Certain increases in postal and telephone rates are also proposed, andare expected to yield about  900,000.70. The rate of excess profits tax is to be continued unchanged at 66f percent., and the emergency surcharge of one-fifth over the schedule of customsimport duties imposed in 1942, for one year, is to be continued for a further year.71. On the Ways and Means side total borrowings between July 1942 and January 1943 averaged  14\ millions a month. Since the beginning of the warDefence.Loans aggregated  201 millions.
72. Utilisation of Sterling. The Finance Member in his Budget speechpointed out that, with the virtual cessation of interest payments to externalbond-holders as the result of the debt repatriation schemes, the only substantialrecurring liability still &quot;remaining in respect of which sterling remittanceswould, normally be necessary, would be sterling pensionary payments, the amountof which, in the period that lay ahead, was estimated at about  5 to  6 millions a year. The Government of India had under consideration a scheme for makingadvance provision for the requisite sterling remittances with which to meetfuture payments in respect of these liabilities on the lines of the arrangementsrecently made for sterling Railway Annuities. It was not contemplated thatthe rights of any class of Government servants would be affected, or that liability in respect of the pensions should be transferred from the Government of India.73. The Government of India was also considering a proposal that some-thing in the nature of a Reconstruction Fund should be set up to provide for financing the programme of post-war reconstruction, including the rehabilitationand re-equipment of industry. In the post-war period, India would have heavy demands for imported machinery and plant to equip a greatly expanded industrialsystem, and it would be necessary to proceed on some orderly programme of purchases from overseas. The existence of a Reconstruction Fund in conjunctionwith a concerted programme of requirements would enable India to go ahead with post-war reconstruction with the minimum of delay.Economic.74.   Nothing to report.Naval, Military and A ir Force A activities.75. Royal Indian Navy. The following vessels have been completed inIndia during the month : One Minesweeper (Bangor).Two Trawlers (Bassets).Six 72-foot Motor Launches.Coastal craft of the R.I.N., in a successful action near Ramree Island, off thewest coast of Burma, engaged two armed enemy launches loaded with troops andammunition. One enemy launch was blown up and sunk, the other was left in asinking condition. Over fifty Japanese soldiers were killed and a number were captured.76. Military. The Arakan operations have continued during the monthboth in the Mayu Peninsula and in the neighbourhood of Rathedaung, but little progress has been made against strong enemy resistance in difficult jungle country,though heavy casualties have been sustained by the Japanese.77. Our patrols have been active in the Chin Hills area and have inflictedcasualties. A small enemy force advancing from Myitkyina on Sumprabum isbeing harassed by levies and U.S.A. Air Corps and is suffering considerablecasualties.. 78. A ir. Our air operations have continued on the same lines as last month.The enemy effort continues to be weak. Bombing attacks on our forward positions in Arakan caused little damage or casualties. Two ineffective attacks were madeon U.S.A. airfields in N.E. Assam. In the second of these American fightersintercepted and inflicted severe losses.79.   Japanese air losses are computed to be as follows :  December : Destroyed 16, probably destroyed 3, damaged 20.January : Destroyed 17, probably destroyed 5, damaged 10.February : Destroyed 30,* probably destroyed 17, damaged 16.The February claims are provisional, and include American claims.80. General, The&apos; internal situation has continued quiet. Certainprecautionary troop movements were made in view of Mr. Gandhi&apos;s fast.81. Operations against the Hurs are moving to a successful conclusion.Most of the prominent leaders have now been arrested or liquidated.*       * Includes 13 destroyed on the ground.
82. The incidence-of malaria has not greatly decreased but anti-malarialmeasures are now making considerable progress.83. There has been some improvement in the food situation. Two factorieshave been started to produce dehydrated meat which it is hoped will solve thepresent difficulty of having to provide the Army with meat on the hoof.84. Morale in the Army continues to be satisfactory, though somedisappointment is expressed at the slowness of the Tunisian campaign.85. The Chinese Minister for War and the Master-General of Ordnancevisited India during the month at the invitation of the Commander-in-Chief.86. The Commander-in-Chief is considering the setting up of an operationalresearch organisation on the lines of that at the War Office to examine conditionspeculiar to India and advise on equipment and other problems.87. Boards to select candidates, both British and Indian, for commissions-are being set up in India. These Boards will be similar to those employed inthis country. An officer with full knowledge of the War Office system is being sent out to advise in the matter. A team for the selection of British other ranks is being sent from this country. A team t*o select Indians will be formed in India, psychiatrists being sent from the United Kingdom.88. In the summary for December 1942 it was mentioned that it had beenpossible to reduce considerably the number of Field Army Battalions employedon Internal Security and railway protection. It will be appreciated, however,that the number of battalions constantly employed on Internal Security dutiesproper, railway and aerodrome protection, guards on P.O.W., guarding Depots,bases, installations (including American and Chinese) is a large commitment.Some 80 Battalions are now employed on these duties, and it is anticipated that more will be required, in addition to a large number of armed police, if thesecurity of India as an operational base is to be guaranteed.89. Delays in delivery of mails to troops in India have been investigated by a Committee set up by the Commander-in-Chief, and its interim report hasbeen submitted to the Postmaster-General. In the meantime, each British soldierarriving in India is being issued with a free airgraph to communicate hiscorrect postal address to his relatives in the United Kingdom. A free airgraphis also issued to men who after arrival have not received correspondence fora long time or whose correspondence has been delayed through its beingincompletely addressed.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.Conditions in Occupied Burma.90. Japanese firms in Burma are reported to be concentrating on exporttrade : information received so far suggests that there have been no imports exceptof machinery. The Japanese have offered to buy all the rice crop at Rs. 100 per100 baskets,&apos; the price which before the invasion was regarded as the minimum necessary to keep the cultivator contented.Frontier Administration.91. Kachin levies in the north of Myitkyina District had, two small butsuccessful engagements, and their information about enemy concentrations enabled the United States Air Force to make several attacks upon Japanese Forces. the morale of Levies in the Chin Hills is also; high after successful brushes with theenemy.92. It was reported in November that the Chinese had set up de factoadministration in two areas of Burma in the undemarcated frontier&apos; zone. Theylater withdrew from one area, but during February a party of Chinese officerspenetrated even further westwards. The question of defining military spheres of influence on the north-eastern frontier has also been mooted by a Chinese general to our Eastern Army. The latter have been instructed to&apos;refrain from such discussions pending a conference between General Headquarters, India, and the americans.
General.93. It has been arranged that the part of the Burma Army which still remains under the control of the General Officer Commanding, Burma, should beplaced directly under the operational and administrative control of the Com-mander-in-Chief, India : a Burma Section attached to General Headquarters, India, will provide the necessary administrative liaison between the Burma Armv-and the Government of Burma.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies&quot; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs. :Food Supplies.94. Ceylon. The question of the supply of cereals to Ceylon has continuedto receive close attention. After reference to the War Cabinet shipping committee arrangements have been made for three ships to be allocated to carryflour to Ceylon from Australia, and these ships, which should arrive in Ceylonduring March, will bring a total of some 28,000 tons. It is hoped, in addition,that the first consignments of rice from Egypt will arrive during March.95. East Africa. The position in East Africa, where the failure ofthe rains turned a probable small surplus of maize into a deficit, has given riseto considerable anxiety, and it has been necessary to adopt.a variety of expedientsto meet the situation. The import requirements for civilian consumption are estimated at 30,000 tons of maize, which is required to arrive during the monthsof March, April and May, and there is an additional demand of 16,000 tons for service needs.96. It is hoped that a free Swedish ship will reach East Africa with some,300 tons of Argentine maize and wheat during the first half of Mardh, andarrangements have been made to provide some 9,000 tons of alternative foodstuffsfrom Madagascar. In addition, after reference to the War Cabinet, arrange-ments are in hand to divert to East Africa two ships that were allocated to loadwheat in Australia for India. One of these ships, which should carry some,000 tons of wheat, should reach East Africa about the middle of April.97. It is hoped also to arrange for the supply to East Africa of 5,000 tonsof maize from Angola, and later on maize should! become available for export fromMadagascar.98. The position is being closely watched, a.nd it is hoped that, the steps which have already been taken will relieve the immediate difficulties.Production.99. The problem engaging the most urgent consideration at the moment isthat of increasing to the maximum the production of vegetable oils and oilseeds(palm oil, palm kernels and groundnuts) in British West Africa. Supplies fromthis area have greatly increased in importance owing to a combination of circum-stances, including the cutting off of Far Eastern supplies, the present impossibility of effecting adequate purchases in India, and great uncertainty regardingsupplies of lard from the United States.100. West African production is receiving urgent attention in consultationwith the Resident Minister (Lord Swinton) and the Governors concerned.Measures will include some increases in price, but informed local opinion is thatthese in themselves will be of little value, if not actually harmful, and in conse-quence action is being taken on a broad front, including propaganda drives,provision of seed (for groundnuts) and other administrative measures. Theprovision of consumption goods for the peasant producers is of cardinalimportance, and this is receiving attention also.
Shipping.101. Discussions have taken place with the War Office and the Ministry ofWar Transport about the allocation of the reduced cargo space for the middle east and Ceylon arising from the Prime Minister&apos;s directive on the number ofships to be made available. The allocation for civil cargo for Ceylon from theUnited Kingdom and the United States was in consequence reduced in january and February. -102. Difficulties in shipping civil cargo to East Africa from the UnitedStates have been under discussion with the Ministry of War Transport. It isunderstood that the shortage of space in the past three months has been partlycaused by the fact that the United States ships available do not generally sailbeyond South Africa; consequently space to East Africa has to be made up inmonths when British-controlled tonnage is available. Equipment for theNorthern Rhodesian copper mines is included in the cargo from United Statesof America for which there has been difficulty in obtaining space.Defence.103. Civil Defence. Civil defence policy in West Africa has been reviewed by the War Council in the light of the revised scale of attack. As a result thefour Governments were asked to prepare reduced schedules of equipment and personnel to provide for areas still regarded as vulnerable. It was also agreedthat in preparing these schedules account should be taken of requirements fordealing with fires not caused by enemy action.104. In Kenya, civil defence arrangements are to be fully maintained inMombasa but will be reduced, in Nairobi, to a mobile reinforcement columnwhich may be put on a care and maintenance basis.105.   Further equipment has become available and it is hoped that by theend of March all Colonial requirements for trailer pumps will have been met.106. Mauritius. With reference to paragraph 121 of the report for Tel. i49toJanuary, the Governor of Mauritius has been informed of the Secretary of State&apos;approval of the general tenor of his proposals for reorganising the MauritiusTerritorial Force but has been asked to reconsider them in certain respects, ofwhich the more important are the proposals (a) to conscript aliens and (&amp;) to raiseby compulsion a civilian labour corps for employment on works not all of which appear to be directly related to the prosecution of the war.107.   Seychelles. With reference to paragraph  114 of the report forDecember, General Platt has now visited the Seychelles and discussed with theGovernor the suggested transfer of the Defence Force to War Office control.   It Q^j^*pinhas been decided that a different training method should-be adopted and the       rresults observed after three months and that a decision regarding the futurecontrol of the Force should be deferred until then.108. Ceylon. The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief has proposed theformation of a guerrilla force to be known as the Ceylon Levies. Some time must elapse before the force is formed owing to the scarcity of weapons, but immediateauthority has been requested for the training of instructors as potential N.C.Os.This has been approved in principle by the War Office. The Colonial Office have informed the War Office that they welcome the scheme generally, subject to further examination of the reasons for the proposed rates of pay, which are substancially lower than.those of the Ceylon Defence Force.109. British Solomon Islands Protectorate. The High Commissioner for Tel. 51 fromthe Western Pacific has reported that the United States Service authorities in H-Cl-.w- Pac.the Solomons have on several occasions ordered the punitive bombing of nativevillages on receipt of reports that the natives were showing pro-Japanesesympathies and adopting a threatening attitude towards the British coastwatchers. It is feared that this practice, unless most carefully controlled fromthe highest level, may have very unfortunate effects in alienating the sympathiesof the native population, who, with few exceptions, have been reported over-overwhelmingly loyal throughout the Solomons operations. It may also mean the endof coast watching stations on inhabited islands. Sir Philip Mitchell hasstrongly impressed on the United States authorities the dangers of this policyand has reported that all the senior United States commanders have now agreedthat it shall not be done except in very special cases and that Admiral Halsey
Got.&apos;s tel.No. 1769,Secret, ofDec. 8,1942.Gov.&apos;s tel.No. 283 ofFeb. 11.has issued orders that it may only be done on his personal authority. It is hopedthat as a result the practice will be discontinued, but Sir Philip Mitchell hasbeen informed that an approach to the United States authorities in Washington,through diplomatic channels, would be considered, if at any time it appears thatthe results of his local efforts are unsuccessful and he considers such actionadvisable.110. Russian successes have made a deep impression, tending to eclipseother events.111. Political stirrings among prominent Arabs, referred to in the lastReport, have taken, shape in a definite movement to attempt the formation of an arab political body. This question was discussed at a conference of ArabChambers of Commerce, when it was decided that it was necessary to convene ageneral conference of leading Arabs to create an Arab- political body by electingan Executive Committee to represent and speak for the Arabs of Palestine. it remains to be seen, however, whether personal and party differences will be subordinated to the interests of the community.112. Political activity in the Jewish community has been mainly confined to economic problems, but towards the end of the month the campaign for thetransfer of Jews from Europe was intensified.113. Crop prospects have deteriorated as a result of a total failure in large areas of the south owing to drought. Prices in relation to the cost of livingcontinue to be the focus of agitation. The supply situation in Palestine isdeteriorating, and the High Commissioner reports that it is a cause of growingconcern. The problem is not one of real want. in the sense of conditionsapproaching famine, but present conditions are becoming acute owing to causes which may be summarised as follows : (a) Shortage of rhost of the basic articles of food, so that, although a rationing system is in force to the extent to which differences1 in foodhabits allow, the Government cannot guarantee a ration of any commodity but sugar.(b) The fact that the control system for external supplies through the middle east Supply Centre forces Government to follow hand-to-mouthmethods of distribution, breakdown of which might easily lead tobread riots.(c) A serious cost-of-living problem arising from existing grave inflationarytendencies and the above-mentioned facts, and, in turn, reacting, uponthe whole supply position.114.   Both Jew and Arab recruiting has declined during the month.115. The Governments of India and of Ceylon have been in correspondenceregarding the provision of further labour for rubber estates in Ceylon. the ceylon Government submitted proposals to the Government of India for the recruitment of 20,000 labourers as a special war-time measure on the basis that payment and conditions of employment should be identical with those for otherIndian labour in Ceylon and that the labourers would be repatriated to India atthe end of the war or other period stipulated by agreement. The Governmentof India have now expressed a wish, in the first place, to reach agreement on thegeneral question of the status of Indians in Ceylon. Their proposals for anagreement on this point set aside a provisional agreement which had been negotiated in 1941 by a conference of representatives of the Governments ofIndia and Ceylon were not such as were acceptable to the latter. His Majesty&apos;governments great interest in any measures to increase the rubber supplies fromCeylon has been expressed to both Governments and the question is still undecidedin India.West Indies.116. Sir Frank Stockdale&apos;s Report on Development and Welfare in theWest Indies,. 1940-42 (Colonial No. 184), was published on the 23rd February.Reports on. Individual Colonies.Palestine.Ceylon.
Jamaica.117. The proposals for a new Constitution, which the Cabinet have alreadyseen and approved, were published here and in Jamaica on the 23rd February(Cmd. 6427).Labour.118. The report of a conference of officers of the Labour Departments in west Africa,, which was convened at the office of the Resident Minister at theend of November last, has now been received. The report shows that the inter-change of information on current and potential labour problems was very valuable, and it is hoped to arrange for further conferences to be.held.Social Services.119. A Committee has been appointed, under the Chairmanship of the duke of Devonshire, to advise the Secretary of State for the Colonies on such questions as he may refer to it with regard to problems affecting the social welfare of urban and rural communities in the Colonies, the training of social welfareworkers and other allied matters. The Committee will also consider&quot; questions relating to the delinquency services in the Colonies.120. The membership includes experts on various aspects of social welfareactivities in this country and in the Colonies.
