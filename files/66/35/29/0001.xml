THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 129.March 27, 1943.WAR CABINET.CEYLON CONSTITUTION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I regret that I must again trouble my colleagues on the question of the ceylon Constitution. I only do so because of recent telegrams from the governor and from the Commander-in-Chief and of the wide repercussions which events-in Ceylon may have upon the war effort of the United, Nations. In orderto make plain the present situation it is, I fear, necessary to set out something of the past history of this question.2. The present constitution of Ceylon is of the nature of a dyarchy. I neednot trouble my colleagues with the full details of the very complicated scheme, butthe facts relevant to the present problem are : (a) For the normal purpose of legislative and executive action the power is with a State Council, almost entirely elected on a system of universalsuffrage, and a Board of Ministers comprising the elected chairmen of the seven Executive Committees of the State Council, plus the threeOfficers of State (Chief Secretary, Legal Secretary, and FinancialSecretary, who are permanent officials).(b) Certain matters, such as external affairs, defence, public services, customs and finance, are reserved to the executive control of the Officers ofState.(c) The Governor retains full powers of certification and veto, extending both to executive as well as to legislative action, while additional provision is made for his assuming full control of the administration in theevent of an emergency.. 3. For some time before the war this constitution was admittedly notproving satisfactory, and recommendations for changes were under discussion in ceylon. From the point of view of the present situation, the most important ofthe suggested changes was that the administrative duties hitherto reserved forthe Officers of State should in future be allocated to the Ministers, except, inregard, to certain special subjects, over which the Governor would retain personalcontrol. Moreover, the full powers of the Governor as set out in paragraph 2 (c)would remain without reduction. These proposals were debated at length in the-Ceylon State Council, but, owing largely to minority difficulties, no basis ofagreement was reached. Further examination of the^ problem was interrupted by the outbreak of war and, as it became increasingly clear that a settlement could not be satisfactorily carried out until after the war was over, the Governor-was authorised to give Ministers an assurance that the position would be further examined and made the subject of further consultation by means of a commissioner Conference; that this could not be arranged under war conditions, but thatthe matter would be taken up with the least possible delay after the war.4.   In December of last year, owing to representations from the Governorthat some further declaration was necessary if we were to retain the o-oodwili andco-operation of the Ceylonese Ministers, and if the whole-hearted participation of Ceylon in the war effort was to be continued, I approached, the War Cabinet[25221] copy No.
again. The War Cabinet then approved of a further statement to Ministers being.made in the following terms : &quot; The re-examination of the reform of Ceylon&apos;s constitution after thewar to which His Majesty&apos;s Government stands pledged, will be directedi towards the fullest possible development of self-governing institutions inCevlon within the Commonwealth partnership, having regard both to the single interest of the Island and. to the larger&apos;interest of the Commonwealthon which the Island&apos;s security and prosperity ultimately depend. In their approach to the question of revision of the constitution in that spirit and intention, there will be on the part of His Majesy&apos;s Government the fullestappreciation of the effort and resolution which Ceylon and her people have )shown in defence of the Island and in the cause of the Commonwealth.&quot;5. I have now had an opportunity of seeing the reactions of the ministers in Ceylon to this declaration. Unfortunately, the effect upon them has been farless favourable than the Governor believed it would be, and I fear that as far asthey are concerned it has completely failed in the desired effect. Their reply, tothe effect that the statement was in far too indefinite and conditional terms to allay the growing concern in Ceylon, is included in Appendix I. I have also received telegrams from the Governor and a joint telegram from the governor and Commander-in-Chief dealing fully with the position and making certain new proposals. These telegrams, together with my replies, are also set out in full inAppendix I.6. It will be seen from these telegrams that the Governor and Commander-in-Chief take a very serious view of what may happen if it is not possible, by some new declaration, to meet the desires and aspirations of the more moderate element in Ceylon. They expect immediate and progressive loss of co-operation anddecrease of war * effort, coupled with the deflection of the great bulk of nowmoderate opinion towards intransigent nationalism and the demand for the rightof secession.7. The Commander-in-Chief and the Governor, after pointing out thesedangers, make proposals for a declaration which they feel, though it will not be acceptable to all should satisfy reasonable political opinion. I have set out inAppendix II the declaration which the War Cabinet approved in December side by side with the new declaration now proposed by the Governor and theCommander-in-Chief.8. A comparison of the two declarations shows that, while in the proposed declaration as in the authorised declaration, no hope is held out of any changes &apos;during the war, we should now be definitely committed to a far-reaching reformafter the war. Instead of the aim j2 &quot; the fullest possible development of self-governing institutions within the Commonwealth&quot; we should have given a promise of &quot; full responsibility for government under the Crown in all matters ofinternal civil administration.&quot; The only matters to be reserved would be external relations and defence, while, of course, the proposals do not include any right of secession. Thus, constitutionally, Ceylon, while not attaining full dominion status, would be very much in the position now occupied by Southern Rhodesia,9. There is, however, one overriding condition. The proposed constitution,when it has been worked out by a suitable Commission on- Conference, and providedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied that it complies with the reservationsin paragraph 8, must be approved by three-quarters of the Members of the state council* (excluding Officers of State and the Speaker or other presiding member).The object of this condition is to ensure some safeguards for minority interests,as the Sinhalese (the majority community) cannot obtain the requisite majority&apos;unless some, at least, of the minority elements are in agreement with them.10.   I find the decision in these circumstances a very difficult one to makebut after much consideration I have come to the conclusion that I should* The present composition of the State Council is as followsSinhalese (including 8 Kandyans)Ceylon Tamils   ...Indian TamilsEuropeans (including 3 Officers of State)   ...Muslims ...Burghers...39 seats.6    ,,4    ,,83 ,,1    ,,
recommend the War Cabinet to endorse the Governors proposal for a fuller andmore definite declaration.   The arguments in favour of such a course are : (1) It is necessary to make such a declaration if we are to prevent the veryserious deterioration in Ceylon&apos;s war effort which the Governorthinks is bound to result unless we go as far as this. I need notremind my colleagues of the vital importance of Ceylon, both as astrategical base and as the source of essential war materials, rubberin particular(2) Ceylon has up to now deserved extremely well of the Empire and its war effort, and the admittedly difficult constitution has been worked by ministers with great goodwill and, perhaps, an unexpected degree ofsuccess. It would be a natural thing for them to compare the definitepromises made to India, where, with all respect to India&apos;s war effort,the political element at least has been largely non-co-operative, withthe indefinite hopes held out to Ceylon, where the elected ministers have thrown themselves heart and soul into war production. Thiscomparison may lead to the argument that more can be obtained fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government by making trouble than by methods ofco-operation;(3) The proposed declaration would be an encouragement to Sinhalesepoliticians to turn their minds to settlement with the minorities andto a realistic appreciation of their future relations with India; and(4) Even under the declaration of December 1942, when we come after thewar to a discussion of this question, we shall have to offer a great deal,if not all, of what is now contained in the Governor&apos;s proposed declara-tion. We shall, however, have lost the goodwill which wre should gain by making the declaration now, and proposals which to-day, it isbelieved, will stabilise the situation, may by that time fall far short ofthe majority view.11. It is only fair, however, to put on the other side the very real difficultieswhich arise if the Governor&apos;s proposals are accepted.   They are :  (a) The only definite safeguard, for the various minorities lies in the require-ment of approval by three-fourths of the State Council. I had feared that the discussion of constitutional reform would exacerbate the com-munal position and that we might risk losing the co-operation of theeminorities in the war effort, but I have received the expressed assur-ance of the Commander-in-Chief and the Governor that they do notshare this fear (see the Governors telegram of the 17th February,paragraph 3).(b) A popular Government will assume for the first time complete financial responsibility just at a time when the post-war financial and economic problems of Ceylon may be most acute.(c) There is no specific safeguard for British commercial interests in Ceylon.It is difficult to insert this in view of the fact that the promisesmade to India contain no such provision. Nor is there any definitesafeguard for Indian commercial interests; but India would not be without bargaining power for this purpose.12. Nevertheless, I feel strongly that, even with all these difficulties, thebalance of advantage lies in making a further declaration forthwith. In coming to this conclusion, I attach very great importance to the views expressed by theGovernor and the Commander-in-Chief (1) that a declaration by His Majesty&apos;s.Government in the terms now proposed will satisfy general political opinion in ceylon, and (2) that if such a declaration is not made there will be a progressivefailure of co-operation and a progressive tendency of moderate political opinion to become more extreme in its demands.13. I therefore recommend to my colleagues that general approval should begiven to the declaration in the terms recommended by the Governor and set out inAppendix II, subject to (1) the examination of the actual \yordirig by otherDepartments concerned, especially the Service Departments, India Office and theBoard of Trade, in consultation with the Colonial Office, and (2) submission of the-draft to the War Cabinet for final approval as soon as interdepartmentalconsultations are completed.&apos;   Colonial Office, March 27, 1943. &apos;     &apos;j[25221]
Sir A. Caldecott to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated17th February, 1943.(Secret and Personal.)(Part I.)Commander-in-Chief and I, in consultation with the Chief Secretary, have carefully considered all the points in your secret and personal telegram of 4th February.Your paragraph 2. Although in our judgment all moderate political opinion would, in actuality, be satisfied with assurance on the lines which we propose,this does not, of course, mean that there will not be such measure of expresseddisappointment as is inseparable from any concession less than is asked for.Your paragraph 3. We entirely realise that any statement on the lines proposed by us must receive the approval of the War Cabinet, but we see noreason why, if statement is drafted with due caution, it should involve virtuallythe drafting of the outlines of a new Constitution. We strongly deprecate anyconsultation with the Government of India in this matter, beyond keeping the india Office informed of developments. Anticipation stated in my telegram of31st March, that if the Cripps scheme eventuated Ceylon might seek admission to the Indian Union, has been completely negatived by the failure of his mission.and subsequent Indian events. The present position is that even a suspicion thatany statement was made by permission of the Government of India would preclude its acceptance in Ceylon. Our joint opinion, moreover, is that, in viewof the definite secessionist tendency in India, the security of commonwealth communities and defence imperatively demand&apos; that Ceylon should not be subordinated to India, and that any possible future movement towards fusionshould not be encouraged. Draft of statement such as we would propose follows in Part II of this telegram.3/ Your paragraph 4. We dissent from the view that there is a risk of losing minority co-operation in the war effort, if statement on the lines proposedby us is made. It must be realised that the minority communities are just askeen to be released from Whitehall apron strings as the majority, and that theirdisagreement with the latter is solely in regard to the allocation of Council seats-and share of Government appointments, &amp;c, i.e:, in regard to machinery and notthe essential characteristics of the administration which all agree to keepnational.Your paragraph 5. It follows from the preceding paragraphs that in ourview no disadvantage will attach to course (&amp;), whereas course (a) wouldindubitably induce progressive loss of co-operation; slackening of the war effort,.and demand for secession.Your paragraph 6. We do not regard the present juncture, when the food position and India-Ceylon relations besides other tricky political matters requiredaily attention, propitious for my going home. I would prefer indeed to beexcused from personal consultation, because subsequent reply, if short of present-demands, would render my position here most difficult. This is because, althoughrecommendations made in my published despatch of 13th June, 1938, have been rendered inadequate by recent developments, my name is irrevocably associatedwith those recommendations, and I should be generally suspected of havingopposed any more radical reform.Your paragraph 7. Against your assurance that the absence of promise now would in no way compromise future reform of constitution must be weighed the^certainty that, without a promise now, reform will be undertaken in an atmosphere of disappointment, distruct and dislike, while in the interval control will have progressively deteriorated as indicated in paragraph 3 (1) of my telegram of 27th January.Your paragraph 8. Any information given to the Board of Ministers on thissubject would need to be communicated by them to the State Council, and we are convinced that intimation on the lines.of your paragraph 7 would exacerbate,rather than appease, both bodies. While agreeing that precision at present justice is impossible, we see no reason why general statement of purpose and intention should lead to subsequent misunderstanding and detriment, if plainlyand carefully worded. In that belief we commend for your consideration draft statement which follows in Part II. Recent election of member for Jaffna as  minister for Home. Affairs means that there is now minority representation onthe Board of Ministers.  This fact, in conjunction with proposed stipulation that
any constitutional change would require approval of three-quarters majority (nottwo-thirds as proposed m my telegram of 27th January) of the State council will compel the Ministers to take minor interests fully into account when evolvingconstructive proposals. We therefore advise that onus and method of constmSeffort should be made to he entirely on them rather than on the Governor inconsultation with them, as suggested in paragraph 3 (4) of my teWram of27th January.   Governor would of course assist If invited by them   tele^iam otSecretary of State for the Colonies to Sir A. Calclecott, dated 4th February, 1943.(Secret and Personal.)Your Secret and Personal telegram of the 27th January.I am grateful for fuller expression of your views and appreciate distinctionyou make between Dominion status and constitutional reform which you recom-mend.2. Ministers&apos; request is for Dominion status; your own advice to me isthat general political opinion would be satisfied with the lesser assurance you have recommended.3. You will, of course, understand that promise now of full responsible government on lines you propose could only be given with the approval of theWar Cabinet, and they would need to be quite clear as to the significance ofsuch promise in each of the several fields of interest for which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have responsibilities. To do this with sufficient clarity would, infact, seem to involve virtually the drafting of outlines of new Constitution now insome detail and in spite of obvious great difficulties in attempting to do so.This would require consultation here with Service departments and the IndiaOffice and I cannot see how it would be possible to avoid some consultation or atany rate some disclosure to Ministers in Ceylon and to other interested officialcircles (including Government of India) with consequent provocation of politicalclaims by all concerned in Ceylon and repercussions in India.4. Resulting constitutional decision could not be expected to satisfy bothSinhalese and minority demands and I foresee risk of loss of co-operation in important fields of war service and war industries by one section or another ifthis course were followed.5. The choice is, therefore, between (a) adherence to present form of delclaration, and (b) immediate preparation of proposals for new Constitution as described in (3). Either course is considered likely to involve loss of co-operation and decrease of war effort. The balance of advantage between them, therefore,has to be assessed.6. &quot;If you and Commander-in-Chief still feel on further consideration ofmy views that it is necessary to adopt course (b) it might be necessary for meto ask you to come home for consultation. A discussion with you would be ofenormous advantage to me. Against this, however, your arrival here, even ifostensibly for short leave, would be assumed to have significance relative to con-stitutional demands and, if so, might be most unfortunate if His Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s decision were against any further promise now and gave younothing satisfactory to take back to Ministers. But I should like to know inany case whether you and Commander-in-Chief think present political andeconomic situation in Ceylon would permit your coming home for a short period for consultation if I desired it.7. I want you to be in no doubt that I very fully appreciate and valuegreat importance of contribution which Ceylon has made and is making to war effort and the co-operation which, under the leadership of Ministers and state council,&apos; has made this contribution possible. The future reform of theConstitution will be in no way compromised by absence of promise now in circum-stanees which make precision impossible and which without sufficient precisioncan only lead to misunderstanding and dispute to the detriment of all concernedin the prime task of concentrating on defeating the enemy.8. I should have no objection at all to Ministers being so informed as inparagraph 7 with an assurance that message in my telegram 1411 is sincerelyintended as promise without qualification and certainly with no feeling of distrustor lack of appreciation of Ceylon&apos;s participation in the war effort. But the structure of self-government must be worked out in detail and in negotiation,and it is not possible nor would it be right for His Majesty&apos;s Government now to[25221 I b 3
- a promise results which can only be determined after the examination of theproblem has been completed.9. I shall value a further expression of the views of yourself and commander-in-Chief on the opinions I have expressed above and particularlyin paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.Sir A. Caldecott to Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated 27th January, 1943.(Secret and Personal.)Your secret and personal telegram of 21st January.1. My secret and personal telegram of 11th January did not recommend assurance of Dominion status, but of full responsible Governmentand internal Home Rule within the British Commonwealth of Nations.2. Words in italics entail full reservation to His Majesty&apos;s government under any Constitution to be granted, of control of (a) External relations.(&amp;) Provision for construction, maintenance, staffing and manning of suchNaval, Military and Air defences as His Majesty&apos;s Government may from time to time pronounce necessary to the security of theCommonwealth, including that of the Island. Allocation of expensesunder (6) between the Imperial and Ceylon Governments should besettled between them and fixed by separate agreement and not by the- Constitution, which should provide only for fixation by agreement.3. Views of the Commander-in-Chief and myself on the four points mentioned in your telegram are as follows : *(1) We anticipate immediate and progressive loss of co-operation and&apos; decrease of war effort coupled with the deflection of the great bulk ofnow moderate opinion towards intransigeant nationalism and demandfor the right to secession.(2) We can only repeat that any assurance, short of what we have recommended, will not meet the position, and that danger lies inpromising too little rather than too much.(3) There must be total reservation of control over defence, as stated inparagraph 2 above. No stipulation of&apos; safeguards for political rights for the minorities should be included in the assurance, but seeparagraph (4) following, which will adequately serve this interest.As regards economic rights, there are none that belong to a minority community by virtue of being a minority community. Any denial orlimitation of power under the new Constitution to pass legislationaffecting property or trade of non-Sinhalese (if this is what is meant)would inevitably evoke antagonism and hostility far more inimical totheir interest than the absence of any such constitutional protection.(4) Ministers and Members of the State Council referred to India and Burma,but unlikely that they looked up the&apos; pronouncements to which yourefer, especially as that relating to Burma does not appear on recordhere.. As regards paragraph (d) of the draft of the Indian Declara-tion, any assurance to be given to Ceylon would necessarily, of course,include the statement that the present Constitution must continue to operate until a new Constitution has been approved by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, in accordance with the terms of the assurance and until it has been accepted by a two-thirds majority of the State Council inaccordance with the principle contained in Article No. 80, Ceylon(State Council) Order in Council, 1931. It should also be stated in the assurance that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be grateful forassistance of any committee that the Governor, after consultation withthe Board of Ministers, might decide to appoint for preparation of adraft Constitution along the lines of the assurance for considerationby. His Majesty&apos;s Government.
(Secret and Personal.)Your secret and personal telegram of 11th January.I note that you and the Commander-in-Chief advise that in order to meetthe position no lesser assurance should be given now by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthan pledge of conferment of Dominion Status after the war.I find it difficult to reconcile full significance of Dominion Status for Ceylonin unforeseeable conditions of post-war world with Ceylon&apos;s obvious needs inmatters of defence, commerce and external relations generally. Further there aregeneral Empire defence interests in the Indian Ocean which it must be theresponsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure in their relations withCeylon.Before I find it possible to carry further my consideration of Ministers&apos;request I should greatly value your own and the Commander-in-Chief&apos;s views (1) as to what serious consequences you expect if His Majesty&apos;s Governmentfind it impracticable to go beyond assurance already offered;(2) what, if any, particular changes in the direction of responsible govern-ment (short of full Dominion Status) could safely be promised now for adoption after the war;(3) what, if any, particular reservations, e.g., bases or other facilities forEmpire defence, or political and economic rights of minority communi-ties must, in your view, be maintained in any further promise at this moment as to post-war constitutional advancement;(4) if the case of &quot; certain other British possessions &quot; mentioned in Ministers&apos;message in your telegram No. 1401 is intended to refer to India and burma, have they overlooked the actual terms of the pronouncementsin those cases (e.g., paragraph (d) of draft declaration for discussionwith Indian leaders published 30th March, 1942; and in the caseof Burma, statement by Governor in Burma Legislature on26th August, 1940).You will, I am sure, appreciate that advice in your telegram under referencegoes considerably beyond view which you expressed with concurrence of commander-in-Chief in your telegram No. 1445, which postulated that self-governing powers must be restricted by overriding needs of local and Empiresecurity. I should be grateful for a statement of the reasons for your changeof view.Sir A.

Secret.)Your telegram No;. 1435 and my telegram No. 1864.Ministers request me to telegraph the following submission : &apos;Begins: Although message received in reply to our message telegraphed toyou 8th October concedes, for the first time, thai the purpose of re-examinationof our Constitution, to which His Majesty&apos;s Government stands pledged, willbe the fullest possible development of the self-governing Institutions in Ceylonwithin the Commonwealth partnership, we regret that your reply is in far tooindefinite and conditional terms to allay the growing concern regarding our political status which we reported il our first telegram. It would, indeed, ifpublished, only magnify that concern, inasmuch as it gives no promise of the full
responsible government asked for. We are gratified that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment fully appreciates the co-operation of Ceylon and her people in the war effort/but we are unable to reconcile such full appreciation with a denial to us of thepromises which have been given to the great neighbouring country, whose leaders&apos;and people have not co-operated as we have. Publication of your messagewould certainly evoke the criticism that, in order to obtain promises, it isnecessary to extort them by non-co-operation rather than earn them by&apos;co-operation. We and our people are in whole-hearted support of the ideals ofnational freedom, national development and international co-operation for whichthe Allied nations are fighting, and we are convinced that, if we are given ourmerited status within the British Commonwealth, we can apply those ideals both to our own advancement and to the advantage and security of all sister-nations&apos;within the family partnership. We maintain that by our war effort and by ourprogress under the present admittedly difficult Constitution, we have amplyearned the grant of our request, and that, should it be denied to us, the resolution of our people must seriously deteriorate owing to their disappointment of not1being trusted or rewarded. We therefore most earnestly request an urgent and careful reconsideration of the reply to our former message.   Ends.APPENDIX II.1942 Statement.&quot; The re-examination of the reform,of Ceylon&apos;s Constitution after the war,to which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentstands pledged, will be directed towardsthe fullest possible development of self-governing institutions in Ceylon withinthe Commonwealth partnership, havingregard both to the single interest of the island and to the larger interest of theCommonwealth on which the Island&apos;s security   and   prosperity   ultimatelyStatement now -proposed.&quot;In 1941 the following assurance was given to the Board of Ministers in ceylon :&quot; His Ma j esty&apos; s Government have had under further consideration the ques-tion of constitutional reform in Ceylon.The urgency and importance of the reform of the Constitution are fullyrecognized by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, but before making decisions uponthe present proposals for reform, con-)cerning which there has been so littleunanimity,   but  which  are  of   such-importance to the well-being of Ceylon,His Majesty&apos;s Government would desire 1that the position  should be  further examined and  made  the  subject offurther  consultation by means of aCommission or Conference.   This can-not be arranged under war conditions,;but the matter will be taken up with theleast possible delay after the war.&quot;After  further  consideration,   His&apos;Ma j esty &quot;s  Government  have  decidedthat it is in the general interest to giveigreater precision to the foregoing state-&apos;ment with the object of removing any;doubts    regarding    His    Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s intentions. Accordingly,His Majesty&apos;s Government have asked the Governor to convey to the Board ofMinisters the following message: &quot; The post-war re-examination ofthe reform of the Ceylon Constitution,to which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentstands pledged, will be directed towards. the grant to Ceylon by Order of His.Majesty in Council, of full respon-1sibility   for   Government   under   the1Crown in all matters of internal civil&apos;administration, but with the retention1by His Majesty&apos;s Government of con-;trol over the: provision, construction,.

In their approach to thequestion of revision of the constitution in that spirit and intention, there willbe on the part of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment the fullest appreciation ofthe effort and resolution which ceylon and her people have shown in defence ofthe Island and in the cause of theCommonwealth.&apos;&apos;Statement now proposed.maintenance, security, staffing, manningand use of such naval, military and air defences, equipment and establish-ments, as His Majesty&apos;s Governmentmay from time to time deem necessaryfor the security of the Commonwealth,including that of the Island, the costthereof being shared between the twoGovernments in such manner as may beagreed.. Ceylon&apos;s relations with foreigncountries and with other parts of theBritish Commonwealth of nations will be subject to the control . and direction of His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment.The framing of such a constitution to implement this undertaking willrequire such an examination of detail and such precision of definition as can-not be brought to bear so long as thewhole energies of the Service and otherDepartments of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment must remain focussed on thesuccessful prosecution of the war. HisMajesty&apos;s Government will, however,once victory is achieved, proceed to the examination, by a suitable commissioner Conference, of such detailed pro-posals as Ministers may in the meantimehave been able to formulate, subject tothe clear understanding that the accept-ance by His Majesty&apos;s Government ofthese proposals will depend first upon his Majesty&apos;s Government being satis-fied that they are in full compliance with the preceding portion of this statement, and, secondly, upon theirsubsequent approval by three-quarters of all members of the State Council of ceylon, excluding Officers of State andSpeaker or other presiding member.. In their consideration of this problem His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave very fully appreciated and valuedthe contribution which Ceylon has made and is making to the war effort of theBritish Commonwealth and the united nations, and the co-operation which,under the leadership of the Board ofMinisters and the State Council, hasvmade this contribution effective.&quot;
