THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.    April, 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 149.April 10, 1943.Copy No.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure tiie secrecy of this document war CABINET.THE GOVERNMENT BUILDING PROGRAMME.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.THE labour force approved for the building programmes of the various departments other than the Air Ministry for the current quarter is set out in annex 1 of the Paper W.P. (43) 23 which was approved by the War Cabineton the 20th January, 1943, W.M. (43) 12th Conclusions, Item 4. At their meeting on the 18th February, W.M. (43) 32nd Conclusions, Item 3, the WarCabinet approved a labour force for the Air Ministry for the 31st March at115,000 instead of 90,000 as previously proposed, and took note that by specialadjustments in the call-up of men from the building industry the deficiency inthe total labour force could be made good temporarily without affecting the intakeinto the Forces. The approved labour force for the building programme as awhole- for the 31st March thus became 365,000.2. At the second of the War Cabinet meetings quoted above I was invitedto undertake a review of all departmental building programmes for the period after the 31st March and to submit recommendations to the War Cabinet. TheMinister of Labour has now given me estimates of the labour available for. theGovernment building programme for each of the six months April to September.The following table shows these estimates and the corresponding requirementfigures : requirements ofAvailablelabour.the government building programme.AprilMay &apos;JuneJulyAugustSeptember346,000324,000303,000295,000288.000280,000361,400356,700357,800350.600331,300313,5003. The detailed figures for labour requirements are given in the Annex.Those for the Service and Supply Departments are as stated to me; the figuresunder the heading &quot; Civil Departments &quot; do not represent the demands putforward, but my view of the lowest figures to which the labour force of those departments can be reduced if essential services are to be maintained. Thefigures included for the repair of bomb-damaged houses and for rural housing-are an approximate estimate of the additional, mobile labour required for these schemes, in addition to local immobile labour, if they are to continue on the linesprovisionally approved by the War Cabinet. A small addition would be needed to meet comparable Scottish housing requirements.4. It will be noted that after making the maximum reduction that seems possible in the figure for the Civil Departments as a whole, there remains a gap between total demand and total labour likely to be. available of about 15,000 atthe end of April, rising to over 50,000 in June and July and falling to about33,000 at the end of September.[25280]
5. An investigation of the demands of the Service and Supply Departmentssuggests that I might be able to recommend minor variations or postponementsof certain blocks of work, but not. any reduction large enough to bridge the gapindicated in the previous paragraph, as any reduction of this order would involveissues of policy beyond the competence of a single Minister to decide or recommend.The Admiralty programme includes work for the R.N.A.S. to match the planned expansion of the Fleet Air Arm and for shipyard development, &amp;c, in connectionwith the corvette building programme. . The War Office programme is based on providing accommodation for United States personnel up to the figure of 615,000given in Annex II to W.P. (43) 23 but no further, some additional provision for hospital and storage accommodation for the United States Forces and a limited amount of new work for British needs. The Air Ministry programme includes provision for the eight new airfields, the construction of which has been approvedby the Defence Committee since the matter was last before the War Cabinet(DC. (S) (43) 2nd Meeting).6. I must therefore ask my colleagues to decide whether there is t be asubstantial reduction in the Government building programme, the greate partof which would, necessarily, fall on the work of the Service Departments, orwhether man-power decisions should be modified in such a way as to make available a larger labour force than that indicated in paragraph 2 above. Ifa decision can be given on this point, I shall then be able to submit detailed recommendations for the six months April to September.O.
