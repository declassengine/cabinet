THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTEXTRACT FROM THE DAILY HERALD, APRIL 7, 1943.Fight Ahead on New Town Planning Bill.By Maurice Webb.A new measure to give*Mr. W. S. Morrison, Minister of Town and country planning, extended control over land and building development will shortly be presented to Parliament.1 Since his appointment the Minister has been held up by the absence of any real authority to proceed with effective planning.-The coming Bill-which is now in draft is intended to put him in aposition to start work.But its terms are wholly inadequate and far short of what is required iftown and country planning is to be taken seriously in hand.Demand for Debate.i It does not contain any of the main proposals made in the Uthwatt Report,chief of which was that the State should acquire development rights in all landoutside built-up areas.I forecast that it will have an unfavourable reception in the House ofCommons.Except, of course, among those back-benchers who, because of their fidelityto the cause of the property owners, are all in favour of limiting government authority over land development.Questions are also likely to be raised shortly in the Commons on the presentposition of the Uthwatt Report. This has now been before the Government formany months, and M.Ps. are anxious to know what has happened to it.These questions may be followed by a demand for a full debate on the wholequestion.[25284]
