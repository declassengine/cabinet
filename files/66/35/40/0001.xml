(this document is the property of his.tannic majesty&apos;s governmewt)RjB- C R E T COPY.NO._iApril 5th,1943WAR   cabinet united NATIONS DAYMemorandum by the Minister of information have just received information from Washington that it is the intention of president Roosevelt to constitute June 14th this year &quot;United Nations Day&quot; on thesame lines as last year.June 14th is by American custom the day set apart in honour of the nationalflag.   Last year the President made a special proclamation declaring that the flagsof all the United Nations should be honoured on that day side by side with theAmerican flag and ceremonies of this kind were held throughout the U.S.A.   At thePresident&apos;s request the idea was adopted in this country as well and thePrime Minister issued a message on the same lines.   In consequence a parade washeld outside Buckingham Palace, partly of service and partly of civilianrepresentatives: the King and Queen, the heads of resident Governments and diplomatic representatives were present, and numerous smaller ceremonies wereorganised, through the Ministry of Information, in all parts of the United Kingdom,The question now is whether we should proceed to make arrangements for asimilar observance of United Nations Day this yeare   If we do it looks as if weshall be committed to it as an annual event for an indefinite future.Last year the organisation had to be done at short notice.   But our generalexperience was that the celebrations were popular and acceptable and there is little doubt that the public welcome any opportunity for witnessing parades ordisplays of this kind.On the other hand the concept of the United Nations does not, to allappearances, command the same emotional response in this country as it arouses inthose circles in the U.S.A. that are active in its support.   There is some difficulty in disentangling the concept from the old fashioned idea of war-timealliances, of which the British people have abundant experience: and indeed theessential difference is not easy to discern.   Ceremonies of this kind can be organised with considerable success, given adequate time in which to prepare and war Cabinet approval.   But they do involve exceptional demands on transport and catering as well as special arrangements by Service and other Ministries,    I am not anxious, therefore, to advocate the holding of United Nations Day as a nationalcelebration in this, country unless it is felt that the importance of the occasion^stifles it.Two more facts should be mentioned,   June 14th is Whit Monday bank holiday^is year; and it is virtually certain that some form of official request will bereceived in this country from America that we should make United Nations Day anational event.B.
