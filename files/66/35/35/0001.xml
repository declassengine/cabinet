THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for. the War Cabinet.   April 1943.SECRET.Copy No./W.P. (43) 135./April 3, 1943.WAR CABINET.Personal Injuries (Civilians) Scheme.Equal Compensation for Men and Women.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.THE Select Committee set up to report on the effect of the proposal that therates of compensation for civilian men and women in respect of war injuriesshould be equalised has put forward the following three recommendations :-(a) That civilian women should be compensated equally with civilian men for war injuries.(6) That the distinction between gainfully and non-gainfully occupiedpersons should be abolished, and(c) That a married man in receipt of an injury allowance should receive a wife&apos;s allowance when not in hospital.2. The Select Committee&apos;s report has been examined by the Lord President&apos;^Conrmittee,* who have agreed to recommend to the War Cabinet that theseproposals should be accepted. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has, however,reserved his position in regard to the proposal that the distinction betweengainfully and non-gainfully occupied persons should be abolished.3. The Select Committee pointed out that the adoption of the proposal thatcivilian women should be compensated equally with civilian men for war injurieswould require that the same principle should be extended to all war serviceinjuries sustained by Civil Defence volunteers and to disability pensions payable to men and women in the basic ranks in the Services and the Merchant Navy. TheLord Presidents Committee have agreed to recommend to the War Cabinet thatthis course should be adopted and that the rates for higher ranks should beincreased by the same amount as is added to the basic ranks.4. 1^ annex the draft of the statement which it is suggested should be madeon behalf of the Government if the War Cabinet approve the recommendationsof the Lord Presidents Committee.J. A.Privy Council Office,Great George Street, S.W. 1,April 3, 1943.* L.P. (43) 15th Meeting, Minute 2, 20th Meeting, Minute 1 and 21st Meeting.[25255][P.T.O.
DRAFT STATEMENT.THE Government have given full consideration to the recommendations ofthe Select Committee on Equal Compensation and, after consulting the TradesUnion Congress on points covered by the general pledge of discussion with that body, have arrived at the following conclusions : (1) The Government recognise that, as the Personal Injuries (Civilians)Scheme applies only to injjuries associated with the war, there is forthis reason an essential difference between it and any permanent scheme of compensation. This being so, they have decided that therates of compensation payable under it for disablement to gainfullyoccupied persons need not be related to earnings or to any other factorinvolving sex discrimination. The rates of injury allowance anddisablement pension for gainfully occupied women on account of warinjuries will therefore be raised to the rates at present-provided forgainfully occupied men.(2) The Government have no hesitation in agreeing that this decision mustbe extended to all war service injuries, including war injuriessustained by civil defence personnel; aiso to the disability pensionspayable to the basic grades in the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services and theMerchant Navy, the rates for higher ranks being increased by the same amount as is added in the basic ranks, or in the case of officers,  25 ayear.: (3) The Government have also decided that a&apos; married man in receipt of injury, allowance as a gainfully occupied person or Civil DefenceVolunteer, but not in hospital, should receive as a wife&apos;s allowancean addition of 9s. 2d. a week to the 35s. Od. which he at presentreceives in common with the single man. While in hospital he willcontinue to receive his present rate of 35s. Od.(4) Finally, the Government have decided that non-gainfully occupiedpersons, male and female, including housewives, - shall have theirpresent rates of injury allowance and disablement pension increased in all cases to those at present paid to gainfully occupied men.Thus the Government have accepted in full the recommendations of theSelect Committee in the belief that the Committee are right in holding that these improvements can have no effect on levels of remuneration or in the field ofcompensation.The Government do not propose to wait for the necessary amendment of the many instruments which will be affected by these changes but a little time mustbe taken in making the administrative arrangements for payment at the revisedrates. They will, therefore, be brought into effect with the payments falling tobe made in the week beginning on t&amp;e 19th April, from which week they will beapplied to all existing cases. . .
