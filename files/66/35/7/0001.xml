naval SITUATION.General Review.1.   Light craft have successfully attacked shipping in the Channel.U-boats have attacked several convoys and in consequence shipping losses have been heavy.One U-boat has been sunk and several damaged.A convoy from Alexandria.has arrived, at Malta.Northern Waters.2. A convoy of 26 ships from N. Russia arrived in Icelandic waters. TheHome Fleet provided cover and escort. In attacks by U-boats, one ship was sunk and two others torpedoed. Twelve Ju. 88s. also attacked unsuccessfully. Inaddition, bad weather caused serious damage to one ship which had to be abandoned.Home Waters.3. On the night of the 4th/ 5th E-boats were engaged by the Polish destroyerKrakowiak off Start Point and by H.M.S. Windsor (destroyer) off Lowestoft.H.M.S. Sheldrake (corvette) also drove off three more E-boats. Another group,heard by HALS. Southdown (destroyer), retired to the eastward, and aircraft atdaylight reported one E-boat damaged, one in flames and two awash and sinking.On the following night M.Ls. minelaying off Dunkirk were engaged by enemytorpedo boats without result. H.M.S. Mackay (destroyer) shortly after midnightengaged and drove off two E-boats. These were later intercepted by M.G.Bs. offYarmouth, and one of them was sunk.On the night of the 9th/10th M.T.Bs. 622, 624 and 716 attacked three M/Strawlers off Terschelling, leaving one on fire and damaging another. Later,attacking a convoy, they torpedoed and sank a 6,500-ton tanker and damaged an escort vessel. They were in turn attacked by two German destroyers, which sankM.T.B. 622.  The other M.T.Bs. reached port safely, 624 with slight damage.On the following night M.T.Bs. torpedoed a ship in a westbound escortedconvoy off the north coast of Brittany.Mediterranean.4. A convoy of five ships, including two tankers, arrived at Malta from theEastern Mediterranean on the 6th. The convoy was attacked by 12 Ju. 88s. onthe previous day, and both tankers were slightly damaged. One aircraft was shot down.H.M.S. Abdiel (fast minelayer) shelled a number of motor barges and landing craft proceeding towards Sicily on the 8th.Three enemy convoys have been successfully attacked by aircraft.South-West Pacific.5. On the night of the 5th/6th light U.S. forces bombarded Japaneseinstallations at Vila and Munda in the Solomon Islands, Two enemy destroyers were sunk when their light surface craft opposed this attack.Black Sea.6. On the 2nd a Russian convoy taking reinforcements and supplies to theNovorossisk area was attacked by torpedo-carrying aircraft, and possibly E-boats.Four ships and two escort vessels were sunk and a destroyer damaged.Considerable movement of small craft westwards across the Kerch Straitscontinues.Anti-Submarme Operations.7. An aircraft attacked a U-boat on the surface off Oran during the morning of the 4th. Twenty-five bodies were seen in the water, and the U-boatis assumed to have been sunk.Thirty-two other attacks, 17 by surface Craft, 14 by aircraft, and one by submarine, were carried, out during the week, all on German U-boats, of whichthree were probably and three possibly damaged.On the 4th a Hudson aircraft probably damaged a U-boat west of Finisterre;and on the same day an aircraft probably damaged one off Cape St. Vincent, and
one was possibly damaged 350 miles W. of Finisterre. On the 7th an aircraftprobably damaged a U-boat 400 miles W. of Rockall Bank (North Atlantic);a Hudson possibly damaged one off Cape St. Vincent; and a Ventura possibly damaged one off Port Elizabeth..Enemy Intelligence.German. - . ^ &apos;8. Photographic reconnaissance during the week showed that the Scharn-horst and Emden had left Gdynia and three Narvik-class destroyers had arrived in Bordeaux. -The German s.s. Togo, believed to be the armed raider which was bombed atDunkirk and later located at Cuxhaven, was seen at Kiel on the 7th.Italian.9. Two 6&quot; cruisers left Naples during the week, One for Genoa and one forTaranto.The traffic from Italy to Tunisia, after last week&apos;s increase, again fell to a low tonnage.U-boats. . .10. Over 110 U-boats are estimated to be operating in the Atlantic,&apos; 50 ofthem north of a line joining Newfoundland and. Ireland (II). Seven ItalianU-boats are also believed to be in the Atlantic, operating as far south as Brazil.Reports confirm the extent of the dislocation and disorganisation,suggested by photographs, of Lorient and St. Nazaire after the heavy air attacksmade on the U-boat bases.Protection of Seaborne Trade..11. During the week ending the 7th/8th, 877 ships were convoyed. Ofthese, 254 were in ocean convoys and 623 in British coastal convoys.Sixty-one destroyers (including 11 U.S. destroyers), 91 sloops, cutters,corvettes and frigates (including one U.S. cutter), and one ocean boarding vessel,were employed on escort duties.During the week 127 ships in three ocean convoys arrived in Home waters without loss.12. During the week ending the 6th, imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy totalled 868,000 tons, compared with 594,000 tons during theprevious *seven days and an average of 490,700 tons during the past ten weeks.Of the &apos;week&apos;s imports 393,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.13. In February nine outward ocean convoys of 287 ships reached their destination without loss, except for one straggler; 90 Western Atlantic and caribbean convoys, comprising 1,108 ships arrived at their destination without loss, and one convoy lost one ship only. Further16 ships and two stragglers were sunk in convoys still at sea at the end of the month.Enemy Attack on Shipping.14. UJboats torpedoed 42 ships during the week, 22 of which are known tohave sunk.A slow homeward-bound Atlantic convoy, denied-air cover through bad weather, was continuously shadowed.. Eight ships were torpedoed of whichthree at least have sunk. Five ships in another homeward-bound Atlantic convoywere sunk. Two outward-bound convoys were attacked, one ship in each convoybeing torpedoed.A U.S. convoy off Cayenne (French Guiana) lost three out of eight shipstorpedoed.A homeward-bound Arctic convoy was attacked several times; three ships were torpedoed, of these one has sunk. &apos;Activity increased against convoys to and from North Africa.Four ships in a homeward-bound convoy&apos; were sunk off the west coast of spain and four ships torpedoed, one of which was sunk, in an. outward-bound convoy, east and west of Gibraltar. &apos;Eight ships sailing independently have been torpedoed; five of these have sunk. .        &apos; &quot; &apos; &quot; &apos;    &apos;&quot;- &apos;    &apos; 1 &apos;   &apos; &apos;     *   V^llf[25152] - b
One ship in homeward-bound convoy from Gibraltar was damaged by air attack.   Another ship was damaged in an air raid at Murmansk.A small ship in a British coastal convoy was damaged by a mine.15. Shipping losses of vessels of all tonnages by enemy action during february, as recorded to date, amounted to 308,000 tons, a total which, althoughit compares unfavourably with the final January figure of 238,000 tons, is animprovement upon the monthly average of over 600,000 tons for the periodMarch-November 1942. About 82 per cent, of the losses were due to U-boats inthe Atlantic, four ships were lost through mines, one was sunk by surface craft,and only one ship was lost through aircraft attack.Compared with January, the losses in the North and South Atlantic show anincrease of nearly 70 per cent., whereas the tonnage lost in the Mediterraneanfell from 37,000 to 17,000 tons.Twelve tankers were sunk during the month totalling 96,000 tons;- five were british, three Norwegian, two U.S., one Dutch and one Panamanian.British Minelaying.16. Surface, craft laid mines off Calais and at the western approaches to Dunkirk. Aircraft minelaying was carried out off the German North Seacoast and in the Baltic, the Channel, and the Bay of Biscay. In theMediterranean, the Sicilian Channel was mined on two nights and M.T.Bs. laidmines off Bizerta.Enemy Minelaying.   British Minesweeping.17. Minelaying by enemy aircraft was suspected on two nights of the week in the River Crouch, in areas between Harwich and Flamborough Head, and inthe Humber area.Minelaying was also suspected off Tobruk.Sixteen ground mines were destroyed during the week in Home Watersbetween Yarmouth and Lowestoft and in the Southwold-Aldeburgh area. Sevenmoored mines were destroyed in Lyme Bay, and*three ground mines off Gibraltar.The mine totals are 4,216 ground and 2,270 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.Indian Ocean.18. Three German ships which have been at Mormugao since the autumn of 1939 were reported on the 8th March to be on fire. They are the Braunfels,7-,847 tons, Drachenfels, 6,342 tons, and Ehrenfels, 7,752 tons. Later the ItalianA nfora, .5,452 tons, which had been sheltering in Mormugao since Italy entered the war, was also reported to be on fire. All four ships are reported to havebeen scuttled as well as burnt and the crews are stated to have been taken underpolice supervision to Novagaya.Of 17 merchant ships and one naval oiler in Tunisian ports when theAllies occupied N. Africa, 11 Vichy merchant ships taken over by the Germansreached Genoa in January, according to a belated report.   Of the rest, tworeturned to Marseilles into German hands, while three were damaged, and one \sunk.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing the operations in Russia is included as an inset.)The Russo=German Campaign.Northern Sector. /19.   The Russians attacked in strength against the German defensivepositions south of Staraya Russa and have possibly effected local penetrations.Central Sector.20. Having captured Rzhev and Gzhatsk the Russians advanced astride the railway Moscow-Vyasma- closely following up the German forces, whowithdrew under pressure from their exposed positions iii the salient west of moscow. There is no indication yet where they will stand. Severe frosts have set in at Moscow.  This should favour the Russians.
Orel-Kursk Sector.21. Strong Russian offensive operations continued - south of Sukhinichi,where the Russians effected some further penetrations of the German defences.The Russians also attacked along the southern flank of the Orel salient. further south they have seized Dmitriev, crossed the Bryansk-Kharkov railway, reachedthe general line Sievsk-Lgov-Sumy, and are pressing on north-westward andwestward. &apos; *The Russian offensive operations north and south of Bryansk are apparentlyaimed at this important railway junction and the pinching out of the Orel salient.Kharkov and-Donetz Bend Sector.22. The German counter-attacks against the Krasnograd-Slavyansk salienthave resulted in its&apos; elimination. There are indications of considerable furtherexploitation towards Kharkov.Further east the Middle Donetz was reached on a wide front by the Germans,who captured Slavyansk and Lisichansk.Local thaw conditions, plus ample and intact railway communications,favoured the Germans, as the Russians were mainly dependent on roads whichhad been seriously affected by thaw.Taman Bridgehead.23 Operations in this area have been hampered by thaw. A Russianenveloping movement along the coast of the Sea of Azov from the north waschecked.Summary.24. The Germans, as a result of the Russian operations as a whole and oftheir own losses, have been forced to withdraw from their strongly fortified frontwest of Moscow. Further south the stage is now set for an important advance onBryansk and the capture of Orel.As against this, the heaviest fighting of the past week appears to have takenplace in the Middle Donetz area, where the elimination of the Krasnograd-Slavyansk salient represents an important success for the Germans, exploitation of which may threaten the continued retention of Kharkov by the Russians.Tunisia.First Army.25. Reports received that the enemy attack in the Northern Sector hadslackened proved to be premature for, on the 3rd, vigorous attacks were put inagainst our forces in the Sedjenane area. These attacks continued on the 4th,when close fighting took place in the streets of the town, and on the night the4th/5th we withdrew to Tamera and took up new positions east and north ofthe Sedjenane-Dj Aboid road. In the first attack on Sedjenane, a British battalion position was overrun, but very heavy casualties were inflicted on theenemy, whose strength was two battalions supported by tanks. For a few days the enemy, who appeared exhausted after his efforts, did not follow up his thrust,but on the 9th he put in an unsuccessful attack on Tamera when, after heavy fighting, he was forced to withdraw, leaving over 200 prisoners in our hands.Elsewhere in the Northern Sector the enemy appeared to be on the defensive.On the 4th an attempt to continue his earlier thrust down the Mateur-Beja roadcost him heavy damage to his tanks by our 25 pdrs., and after a counter-attacktwo days later by a British infantry brigade, the enemy was reported to he diggingin along a line roughly parallel with the Oued Zarga-Beja road. In the MedjezEl Bab area and southwards to El Aroussa, vigorous patrolling by our forcescontinued. The enemy appears to have withdrawn east of the Medjez El Bab-Bou Arada road. ,    .These aggressive actions, which began on the 26th February, the purpose ofwhich was probably to make us, reinforce, in the north at the expense of thecentral and southern sectors, cost the enemy some 45 tanks, and his probable mainterritorial objective, the capture of Medjez El Bab, failed.In the Central Sector, our advance continued slowly over ground that theenemy left heavily mined in his retreat. On the 3rd U.S. patrols entered Pichon.but withdrew again as the hills north&apos; and south of the town were strongly held[25152] B 2
by the enemy. Sidi Bouzid, which is near the Faid Pass, from where the enemylaunched his original offensive four weeks ago, is now in our hands again.A French South-Eastern Algerian Command was set up, under the command of General Boissau. Nefta, Redeyef and Tozeur have been occupied by the French,who continued their patrolling activities, north of Chott Djerid.Eighth Army.26. There were strong indications that the enemy had withdrawn part ofhis armour from Central Tunisia and was concentrating for an attack againstthe Eighth Army. Columns of enemy vehicles were observed moving south from.Gabes to the MarethLate in the afternoon of the 3rd the enemy advanced opposite GeneralMontgomery&apos;s right flank with 500 infantry and 30 tanks, but suffered consider -abie infantry casualties from our artillery and withdrew the following day. Atthis period the enemy was concentrating more forces some 25 miles further southin the Halluf area. - During the afternoon of the 5th increased enemy activity was again observed, this time on our left flank. On the 6th two main attacks, with strong artillery and air support, were launched, the first soon after first light, thesecond in the afternoon. These attacks were made from the direction of Toujaneand Halluf and were aimed at the high ground south of the Mareth-Medenineroad. All these attacks failed to penetrate the Eighth Army&apos;s positions at any point and were driven back with heavy casualties; 52 German tanks were knockedout and subsequently blown up by our sappers. Of these, 43 fell to the infantry,who were particularly successful with their 6-pounders. There were no Britishtank losses, and casualties to personnel were very slight. Our infantry were fighting from dug-in positions, but without the protection of mines or wire. Theenemy armoured forces withdrew westwards into the hills. On the afternoon ofthe 7th the enemy infantry that had been operating in the plains north-west ofMedenine also withdrew towards Toujane and into the Matmata hills.Burma.Arakan.27. There was no major change on the Arakan front during the past week.A Japanese force, estimated at one battalion, operating in the Kaladan Valleyoccupied Kyauktaw (30 miles north-east of Rathedaung) on the night the 6th/7th,and had gained some further ground on the foot-hills to the north-east ofRathedaung. Counter-attacks by our troops on the night of the 7th/8th werepartially successful. Fighting continued. A small enemy force infiltrated fromthe east bank of the Mayu River to the rear of our positions. Attempts todislodge them have so far proved unsuccessful.Upper Burma.28. Continuing their advance northwards, the Japanese, estimated strength2,500, occupied Sumprabum, 70 miles north of Myitkyina, on the night of the4th/5th, and are about 36 miles south of Fort Hertz advancing in three parallelcolumns. Our Levies, who fought well in face of the Japanese advance andinflicted many casualties, have dispersed for the time being.Far East.New, Guinea.29. Australian patrols operating from Wau, 30 miles south-west ofSalamaua, have cleared the Japanese from the area two miles south of Mubo.Mubo is 10 miles south of Salamaua. .The Japanese convoy, which was dealt its coup de grace by Allied aircraft in the Huon Gulf on the 4th, is now known to. have been carrying part of a division, the advanced elements of which had already been landed in north-eastNew Guinea early in January. It is reliably estimated that the enemy lost some7,000 fully equipped troops as a result of this action. Although some 3,000survivors may have got ashore, they are without equipment or provisions, andmany, of them have already been mopped up by our patrols. Japanese strength in New Britain, from which area these reinforcements were drawn, is thusreduced by 10,000 to approximately 25,000, whilst enemy strength in New Guineais increased by 3,000, the estimated number of survivors, to 25,000.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.30. Bomber Command despatched strong forces to attack Essen, Nurembergand Munich.Successful attacks were made on enemy convoys in the Mediterranean.Unfavourable weather restricted operations in North Africa. .United Kingdom.31. Forty-nine enemy aircraft flew over this country by day and 44 by night:Others operated off our coasts, some of which were engaged in sea-mining. six were destroyed and one was damaged by fighters; a further two were destroyedby A.A. guns. -Germany and Occupied Territory.Bay.32. Mosquitoes, carrying 4&apos; x 500-lb. bombs, made very effective low-levelattacks on railway and industrial targets in northern France. Two raids by atotal of 13 aircraft had as their objective the railway centre and locomotive repairshop at Aulnoye (S.E. of Valenciennes). Bursts were observed on locomotive shops and engine sheds, where a big explosion and columns of smoke were seen. TheLouvroil Moutbard ,Factory in the same locality was hit by all twelve bombs dropped by three Mosquitoes. Other targets attacked with considerable, successwere the locomotive shops and roundhouse at Le Mans (Arnage), and enginerepair shops at Lingen and Tergnier (S. of St. Quentin). On the 9th the RenaultWorks south of Le Mans was bombed by 15 Mosquitoes and many direct hits were made on the main buildings, resulting in a vivid explosion and volumes of black smoke.   From these operations two aircraft are missing.U.S. heavy bombers made two large-scale attacks, each by approximately60 aircraft, against Lorient and Rennes. At Lorient a concentration of bombsburst in the area of the Northern Electric Power Station; at Rennes, where the.Railway Centre was the objective, much damage was caused to rolling stock andstation buildings, and traffic was effectively blocked by hits on the bottle-necksat both ends of the main yard. On the 4th, 71 U.S. Fortresses (B. 17) were despatched to bomb Hamm; 17 of these attacked in favourable conditions andwith good results, while others bombed Rotterdam. Formations of about 15 U.S.Liberators (B. 24) bombed the port area of Brest and the railway centre at Rouen.Two hundred and fifty-four heavy bombers were despatched on these operations, in the course of which considerable fighter opposition was encountered;15 U.S. bombers are missing and 51 enemy aircraft were destroyed, 6 probably destroyed and 11 damaged.Fighter Command provided escort and cover for some of these operations and also flew a number of offensive sweeps, in one of which a squadron of U.S.Thunderbolts (P. 47) participated for the first time; enemy casualties were sevenfighters destroyed, three probably destroyed and seven damaged, and wp lost threeSpitfires. ,.Night.33. Bomber Command despatched a total of 1,059 aircraft against objectives on land, the three principal targets being Attacked     TonnageDespatched.  Primary.   ,of Bombs.    Missing.

Weather conditions were good, the Pathfinders dropped their markerbombs accurately and these were followed by an excellent.concentration of bombingwith H.E. and incendiaries; the crews reported an area of conflagration of about.x 2^ miles in extent. At the commencement Flak was intense and searchlightsnumerous, but as the attack developed the defences appeared to weaken.Subsequent photographic reconnaissance revealed a total area of devastationEssenNurembergMunich
of *450 acres; in addition severe damage was caused to Krupps Workscovering an area of  135,840  square yards,  and acres of workmen&apos;sdwellings were destroyed by fire. Other damage of considerable importance isreported in Appendix VI.At Nuremberg the weather was clear over the target but a ground hazerendered accurate identification of ground details &apos; difficult. At the outset the bombing was somewhat scattered though later some concentration was achievedand many good fires were seen burning.In the raid on Munich marker bombs were well placed and as the attackdeveloped bombing became increasingly concentrated. A large number of fireswas started in the town and these appeared to be developing well as the air-craft left. Many crews reported three very large explosions; the second of these was the most spectacular and probably occurred at the gas works which is oneof the sources of supply to a long-distance grid system.A total of 19 Mosquitoes employing blind-bombing technique carried outindividual attacks on targets in the Ruhr. Thirty-one aircraft were despatched to France to drop leaflets.An assessment of damage, referring to many of the day and night attacksreported above, is contained in Appendix VI.Coastal Operations.34. One hundred and seventy-four aircraft of Bomber Command and11 Naval Swordfish were despatched on sea-mining operations and 388 mines were successfully laid in enemy waters. Nine aircraft are missing and two others crashed.Beaufighters on patrol in the Bay of Biscay destroyed one Ju.88.Fighters, operating off the Dutch . coast,  destroyed three  E-boats andprobably destroyed a fourth.Mediterranean.French North Africa and Tripolitania. ,35.   Air operations were considerably hampered by bad weather. /The airfields at El Aouina and La Marsa, near Tunis, were attacked in daylight by 71 U.S. Fortresses (B.17) escorted by 21 U.S. Lightnings (P.38).Many fires were started among aircraft and buildings. Eight interceptingaircraft were destroyed, two more were probably destroyed and six were damaged.   One Lightning (P. 38) is missing.Sixteen escorted U.S. Fortresses (B.17) made a daylight attack on Sousse.Hits were obtained on a large ship, on the railway centre and on warehousesand buildings along the east jetty.Djedeida was attacked by 12 escorted II.S. Mitchells (B.25). Bursts were seen on buildings in the town and on the landing ground. Fighter-bombers and fighters made two successful attacks on Sedjenane where several buildings were hit.   Gafsa was bombed by ten U.S. Marauders (B.26).Enemy M.T., tanks and troops were continuously attacked by fighter-bombers and fighters, especially on the Eighth Army Front, where heavy casualties wereinflicted on the retreating enemy. At Ksar Rhilane (54 miles S.W. of Medenine)more than 50 vehicles were destroyed or damaged.Allied fighters flew numerous offensive patrols and reconnaissances and provided protection for shipping.Enemy aircraft made several attacks on our landing grounds and on our troops and tanks in the battle areas. About 15 aircraft bombed Tripoli Harbour,causing minor damage and some casualties.Sicily and Southern Italy.36.   Weather conditions were unfavourable throughout the week.Five Liberators (B. 24) dropped 13 tons of H.E. bombs on Naples. Severalfires were started in the harbour area.Wellingtons dropped 50 tons on Palermo. Many bursts were seen in the harbour, but further results could not be observed owing to a smoke screen. OtherWellingtons bombed Licata, Gela and Agrigento.   -Spitfires, some of which carried bombs, attacked railway targets in South-East Sicily, destroying a locomotive and some sheds and damaging a bridge,goods trucks and signal boxes.
Sea Communications.37. On the 4th, U.S. Fortresses (B. 17) with fighter escort attacked a convoy of six ships north-west of Bizerta. Four ships were sunk and, the others were damaged. On the 7th, escorted U.S. aircraft made two attacks in theSicilian Channel on a convoy heavily escorted by warships and aircraft. two ships were sunk, another was ieft sinking and four others (including an escort vessel) were set on fire. On the following day, escorted U.S. Fortresses (B. 17)bombed, a convoy off Cape Bon; near misses were obtained on three ships.During these operations, 23 enemy aircraft were&apos; destroyed, 14 were probably destroyed and nine were damaged.   One Allied bomber crashed on landing.Russia.38. Russian air operations, which were on a reduced, scale owing to bad weather, were confined chiefly to the area south of Lake Ilmen, to the Ukraineand to the Western Caucasus.In the Barents Sea, Russian aircraft torpedoed and sank a German ship of14,000 tons.In the Lake Ilmen area, the Russian Air Force operated strongly in supportof their land forces around Demyansk.On the Southern Front, the Russian Air Force was engaged in defensiveoperations against the German advances in the - Ukraine, and in raids on.Novorossisk, Taman and Kerch, on shipping in Kerch Straits and -on other objectives in the Western Caucasus and the Crimea.The main weight of the German Air Force was engaged, in South Russia,where considerable air support was afforded to the German counter-attacks inthe Donetz Basin and. in the area south and south-west of Kharkov. The bomber force directed a considerable proportion of its effort against Russian railways.In the North, &quot;bombing attacks were made on railways and on shipping at murmansk.The Russians claim to have destroyed 129 German aircraft during the week for a loss of 79 of their own.Pacific Zone.New Guinea Area.39. The remnants of the Japanese convoy in Huon Gulf (referenceResume 183) were attacked and ail ships are reported to have been sunk; onedestroyer was sunk by a U.S. Fortress (B. 17) and another off Cape Ward Huntwas sunk by U.S. Mitchells (B. 25). Troops in boats and barges were attacked and on the 6th no trace of living Japanese could be found in the water.In the Lae area airfields were attacked on two occasions by Beaufighters andU.S. Bostons (A. 20). Six aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and in combatnine were shot down and 10 others were damaged. It is probable that the raidingof the airfields played a part in the success of the operation against the convoy.Other attacks, on a small scale, were made by U.S. Bostons (A. 20) in theWaria River Mouth and in the Guadagazal (42 miles S. of Lae) areas.An ineffective enemy attack was made on Goodenough Island (200 miles east of Port Moresby) by nine bombers with fighter escort. Another raid on asimilar scale was made on Allied shipping at Porlock Bay (200 miles S.E. of Lae),and one vessel was sunk. On the 9th, 26 bombers escorted by 21 fighters attackedWau airfield causing a few casualties and rendering the runways temporarilyunserviceable. - $A attacks on Shipping.40. On the 10th, a 7,000-ton ship off Boetong Island (Celebes) was probably sunk and a 5,000-ton ship at Wewak was severely damaged by U.S. heavy bombersBurma.41. About 110 escorted Blenheims carried out attacks in the Rathedaung-Akyab area. These were made on villages, military targets, sampans and rivercraft, and on enemy positions north-east of Rathedaung in support of our land forces. Hurricanes also participated in these operations and successfully silencedenemy gun positions. A fighter, sweep by. Hurricanes engaged 22 Army Type&quot; 0 &quot; fighters and destroyed seven, probably destroyed five and damaged two, forthe loss of one Flurricane,
In the Mandalay area, railway targets were attacked. A good raid on therailway centre at Mandalay was carried out by U.S. Liberators (B. 24) where16 tons of bombs were dropped in the target area. The Myitnge Bridge and theGokteik viaduct (60 miles N.E. of Mandalay) were bombed by U.S. aircraft andthree hits were made at the base of the viaduct, but damage is not known.A night attack by seven Wellingtons was made on Thazi.In the Katha area Blenheims bombed railway sidings and also attackedPinlebu to the West of Katha.Seven IJ.S. Liberators1 (B. 24) attacked Prome railway centre and othersbombed Moulmein causing large fires.Near Rathedaung 15 enemy aircraft were intercepted by six Hurricanes and forced to-jettison their bombs. On another, occasion enemy fighters attacked our communications.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.42. On Sunday the 7th bombs were dropped at Eastbourne where consider-able damage was done to property and civilian casualties included 14 killed and23 injured. On the 9th, bombs were dropped at Worthing, causing damage to property, and at Hove, where six persons were killed.By Nighf.43. On the 7th/8th, there were incidents at various points in Hampshire, the isle of Wight, Surrey and Sussex, but damage was slight and only one personwas killed. On the 9th/10th, bombs were dropped at Portland, causing some damage and a few casualties, and in the Weymouth neighbourhood. There wasalso scattered bombing in the East Riding of Yorkshire. The Hull-Leedsrailway was damaged at Melton and a goods train derailed, and the Hull-Doncaster up line was blocked at South Cave.Casualties.44. The estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hours on the10th were 240 killed and 173 seriously injured. These figures include 178 killed and 60 seriously injured in the incident at Bethnal Green, which was recorded in last week&apos;s Resume.

The flotationplant building and the machinery therein were severely damaged.Italy.Naples. vInterpretation of photographs taken during the dusk raid on Naples by the9th U.S.A.A.F. on the 7th February is hampered by the darkness and obliquityof the prints, the smoke arising from the target and the shadows caused by thissmoke.Several bursts are seen across the repair basin, one being possibly a direct hit on a M/V at the Cesario Console mole, a possible hit on vessels berthed betweenthe two dry docks, and another possible hit. on a merchant ship at the VittorioEmanuele II mole, on which there is also an explosion and much smoke rising.A puff of smoke over a cruiser south of the Angioino mole may be the.result ofa bomb burst. There is a bomb burst on the dry dock under construction, manybursts in ex-Pattisons&apos; shipyard, a burst on the end of the Duchessa ElonaD&apos;Aosta quay, and several bursts on and in front of the G-ranili barracks whichlater appeared to be on fire. Smoke is rising from the A.CLP. fuel storageinstallation, from the port railway station and from three or more hits on buildings north of the harbour. There are a.dozen bursts in the area betweenthe Vittorio Emanuele mole and the gas works. Obliques taken very late in the attack show volumes of smoke arising from the area of the quays and from thetown, as if several fires had been started.Messina..In recent attacks by 9th U.S.A.A.F. one train ferry was put out of action,leaving only three to carry on this service.Sea-Mining.The following results of R.A.F. mining operations have been received. all ships mentioned are German :^ (i) Late in 1940 a minesweeper M. 11was sunk.
