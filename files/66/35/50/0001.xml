. THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1943/---^---./-^SECRET. - Copy Nd.W.P. (43) 150.April 9, 1943.WAR CABINET.SOCIAL AND -ECONOMIC POLICY EOR INDIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.AT the War Cabinet Meeting on the 31st August, 1942 (W.M. (42)119th Conclusions, Minute 9), I was invited to &quot; draw the Governor-General&apos;attention to the general feeling of the War Cabinet that the Government of Indiamight with advantage give early consideration to the development of a moreprogressive social and industrial policy.&quot; A few days later I received a copyof a Note on Indian Policy by the present Minister of Aircraft Production, whichadvocated that we should seek to secure the support of the mass of Indian opinionduring the war. by a large-scale positive programme of social improvement,supported by a propaganda campaign designed to show that these benefits wereclue to British initiative. On. the 20th September, 1942, the Prime Ministerdirected that this Note should be considered by the Minister of aircraft production, the Minister of Labour, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself.As the proposals in the Note were obviously relevant to any communication to theGovernment of India of the War Cabinet Conclusion referred to above, Irefrained from communicating it pending further consideration of the matter.The Ministers concerned met in accordance with the Prime Ministersdirections on the 29th September, and Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar and some of myAdvisers were present. The discussion at this meeting made it clear that to launch and maintain a social and economic policy which might achieve thepolitical ends projected would require a very large sum of money. A policy onthe scale envisaged could only be initiated and directed from here if it were toa large extent financed by this country, as the responsibility for matters of thiskind, was transferred to Indian hands some 25 years ago. The sort of sum required to produce any substantial political effects of the kind envisagedwould be of the order of  400 or  500 million, spread over 10 years. The effectof such payments would be to aggravate the already serious problem of theIndian sterling balances. Moreover, some of my Advisers, and Sir RamaswamiMudaliar in particular, considered that we should gain little or nothingpolitically, as all parties would allege that the policy was an. attempt to bribethe population away from its political leaders. The meeting agreed that I should prepare a note showing progress made in these matters in recent years, and thiswas provided during October. I then suggested that we should put to the Viceroythe general proposition recorded in W.M. (42) 119th Conclusions, Minute 9. butthe Minister of Aircraft Production felt that we should draw up more specific proposals, and he and the Minister of Labour have drawn up a memorandum,setting out the lines upon which they feel that the Government of India shouldbe urged through the Viceroy to proceed. This note forms Appendix I to&apos;this paper.My views on the matter are contained in the note which forms Appendix II.Shortly, I consider that it would be undesirable to issue instructions to an outgoingViceroy, without previous reference to the Indian authorities who are primarily responsible for matters in this field, and who are at present engaged upon theconsideration of social and reconstruction plans. The Minister of Labour andthe Minister of Aircraft Production would prefer to dispense with this referencerand the Prime Minister has directed that the matter should be considered by theWar Cabinet. &apos;L. S. A;&apos;India Office, April 9, 1943.[25294]B
II. The Nature of the Problem.4. The fundamental explanation of India&apos;s low social standards is to befound in the fact that, in spite of its external trappings, India, is an ancient societywith a mediaeval economy. The questions at once arise : How can the ancientsociety of India, and its mediaeval economy, be modernised ? How can a scientificagriculture and a large industry be created ? A similar social and economic problem has been tackled in Japan and Russia with some success. On what lines should it be tackled in India&apos;?5. In India the solution of the problem is rendered far more difficult by the unfortunate historical incidence of the growth in population. The fall in the death rate and the rise in the survival rate has accompanied the growth of moderneconomies everywhere. But in &quot; Western &quot; industrial countries the contemporaryincrease in the physical productivity of agriculture and industry raised outputdisproportionately to the growing population. As a result, average productionand consumption -i.e., the standard of living rose steeply.In India-this has not happened. British rule removed war and plague the main checks to multiplication long before any widespread mechanisationof industry and agriculture had taken place. In the last forty years famine hasbeen conquered,&apos; and the rate of population growth has received yet anotherstimulus. It is now increasing by tens of millions in every decade. Yet industrystill offers employment to no more than one-tenth of India&apos;s population; andthe average productivity of agriculture is increasing very.slowly.The &quot; Malthusian devil&quot; has therefore been unchained in- India. Anincrease in the general standard of living is thereby rendered peculiarly difficult.Temporary improvements in average production are soon submerged by anincrease in the number of mouths, and the pressure upon land grows heavier.As a consequence many proposals e.g., for the reduction of infant mortality bygreater medical care though inspired by the highest motives, are not likely totouch, -and in certain cases will exacerbate, the real problem.6. The crucial object of policy must be to bring the growth of population or at least the birth rate under control.Note by the Minister of Labour and Minister of Aircraft Production.i.-^-Introduction.1. During the last forty years great advances have been made in the social and economic life of India, Yet it cannot be said that much impression hasbeen made on the poverty, ignorance and ill-health which characterise the Indianscene. The Reports of the International Labour Office and of the League ofNations refer to the low standards of nutrition among the Indian agricultural and industrial workers. The &quot; Blunt &quot; Report on Social Services in India (1938)speaks of parents &quot; living in penury and steeped in debt.&quot; children &quot; withdrawnfrom school as soon as they can work .... and add, however minutely, to the family income.&quot; Only 11 per cent, of the population is literate. Peasant andindustrial workers are in debt for the greater par^ of their industrial lives. Manyare born in debt. Over a wide range of industry working conditions aredeplorable. Disease is rampant and mortality rates are high. The averageexpectation of life at birth is twenty-five years, compared with fifty-four inEngland and Wales. Yet the annual expenditure on public health throughoutBritish India is considerably less than that of. the London County Council.2. It is plain that there is no lack of room for progress. The exigencies ofwar and internal politics may set limits to what is immediately possible. even so, it is hardly open to doubt that some things could be pushed on withimmediately and that preparations could be made now for going ahead with othermatters as soon as conditions are favourable.3. In the following paragraphs an attempt is made to describe briefly thenature of the problem and to indicate what appear to be some promising linesof advance. Finally, suggestions are made concerning the procedure which mightbe adopted to give effect to some of the proposals which are made.
In other countries the vicious circle has been broken by two forces; the slowspread of rational ideas and of scientific knowledge has rendered the populationwilling and able to limit&apos; the size of their families; the increase of productivityhas provided men and women, or large numbers of them, with a higher standardof living that they were eager to protect. No other factors compare in importancewith these.Both these methods of improvement presuppose, however, a growth of scientific rationalism in the village and the emancipation of the peasant from hisignorance and his superstitions.  These are plainly educational problems.7. In view of the vital importance of the Indian population problem itis desirable that it should be the subject of an investigation by a team of experts,including an experienced medical officer, an economist, a statistician, and asociologist with intimate knowledge of social conditions in different parts ofIndia. Ten years ago, it could not have been possible to embark on such an enquiry. Since then there have been great changes in the public attitude to thediscussion of population problems, including birth control; and it seems thatuseful results could now be obtained.8. If it is assumed that some parallel progress can be made towards limiting the increase of population, then the second requirement of economic policy is animprovement in the productivity of agriculture, and of the vast range ofhandicraft industries closely linked with agriculture.9. Finally, it is reasonable to ask whether the process of industrialisationitself the vast industrial revolution that India is only just beginning-^cannotbe better guided as a result of the experience that we and other industrial countries have painfully gained in the last 150 years.10. There are, therefore, three things that India needs above everythingelse : (i) More education (and a reduction in the birth-rate),(ii) Higher productivity in agriculture (and associated industries).. (iii) A&apos; rapid increase in non-agricultural employment.III.- The Village.11. Nine-tenths of the people of India live at very low standards in750,000 villages that are largely self-contained, most of which are still cut off from urban life, practising a primitive form of cultivation, burdened by a heavyweight of debt, excessive rates of interest and, in some parts of the country, highrents, gripped firmly by the Malthusian devil and dominated by superstitions.The villager therefore needs more education, better health services and a more satisfactory diet.12. (i) Education. &apos; -Only one in ten of the Indian villages possesses a school. Only one in threehave access to a school.  Only 11. per cent, of the adult population is literate.The existing primary schools are for the most part suitably housed, but arebadly staffed by underpaid men (instead of women), who concentrate far tooheavily upon, literacy forcing the children to spend too much of their time uponthe gloomy repetition of letters and numbers and controlling them by far tooliberal a use of corporal punishment. These schoolmasters usually receive about5s. a month, never more than 10s.There is no widespread mass movement for adult education in existence.13. The intricate problems of mass education have been dealt withimaginatively during the course of this century in Russia, Japan and Turkey,by the Americans in the Philippines, and by our own colonial administration in parts of Africa. There should be no insuperable obstacle in India. It is not,difficult to see what is wanted : - .(a) It is necessary to build more village schools for young children and to staff them with, better-paid teachers, who are compelled to attendregular &quot;refresher&quot;, courses and who are persiiacled to practisemodern methods of education.In the meantime, it would be desirable to work, &quot; double shifts &quot;in the existing schools both to increase the output of literacy, and toprovide more time for the other activities of the children.   This.Wl      [25294] &apos;   ;      I   ; B 2
arrangement is working satisfactorily in all other countries with similar educational problems.(b) No large and permanent improvement in the teaching of young childrencan be maintained until the difficulty of supplying qualified womenfor the village schools has been overcome. It is therefore plainlydesirable to increase the number of Training Colleges that will send out a stream of teachers and nurses to the villages, who can live inpairs in the school buildings. The nurses would be charged with thetask of improving the health of the children and, possibly, spreadinga knowledge of contraception.*The difficulty of securing women for this work in India is extremeand familiar. The early age of marriage and the subsequent segrega-tion of the wives limits the supply of women greatly, At the sametime, the existing Colleges have not been empty and there are certaingroups of women widows and the wives of the male teachers whose services are available. Moreover, the provision of medical care in the schools would, in all probability, increase the number of girls whowere sent to them.(c) The time is ripe for the launching of larger campaigns than in thepast similar to those that yielded such remarkable fruits in Russiaand Turkey for the mass education of adults. For this purpose aspecial mobile service of Indian students and graduates, speciallytrained for the work, who would go to the villages but would not settle in any one of them, is required.All this is familiar ground. A programme of this kind could be started to-morrow if the necessary impulse were given from the centre. Here anincoming Viceroy would have a great opportunity. There is no lack of interestin the subject and a great deal of good work is already being done in many partsof the country. What is needed is a strengthening of the central directorate ofeducation at present hardly more than embryonic and the provision of fundsat the centre to be used as grants-in-aid of new educational developments in theProvinces. Any attempt to strengthen the position of the centre in dealing withan important provincial subject such as education would raise familiar constitu-tional difficulties. These difficulties, however, are not insuperable. Thus thesuccess of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, as a means of reconciling Provincial and State autonomy ,with the advantages of Centralco-ordination and initiative, suggests a possible line of development. Theestablishment of a comparable body for educational research and development would be a great step forward but it would be necessary to endow it with considerable financial resources to enable it to give an effective impetus topromising experiments and developments in the Provinces.14. In preparation for a development of this kind it would probably be helpful if studies were made of the new techniques which have been used in ruraleducation in Russia, Turkey and the British colonies.In particular, it is almost certain that it would be profitable to send a smallexpert commission of enquiry to investigate the position in Russia where radio,itinerant exhibitions, wall newspapers and other devices are said to have been used with great effect.15. There is, however, a different and more difficult problem to be tackled.It is essential, if newly acquired literacy is to be maintained, to provide theliterate with something to read. Literacy is no use without literature. It isessential to produce and distribute to the village a supply of vernacular news-sheets, books, wall sheets and travelling films. Obviously, this is not a task forthe British. It should, however, be possible to stimulate the production ofsuitable material by the Indians themselves.16. (ii) Agricultural Productivity.Greater agrarian efficiency depends upon higher levels of education. Bettermethods of production, and the use of co-operative societies to provide cheaper* Congress has suggested that a cultural centre could be built and financed in each villageby the grant of a land endowment for the construction of a school and the payment of a teacher the building to be used for the education of two groups of children, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, and of adults in the evening. It is not quite clear why the. endowment shouldbe made upon a voluntary basis, nor why the medical education of the villages should not be equally pressed. . . &apos; .
credit and profitable markets, can rarely be established or maintained withoutconsiderable scientific understanding on the part of the peasant. But a directattempt to raise productivity should, nevertheless, go hand in hand with the educational programme, since knowledge without prosperity would be sterile.17. The main methods for improving the crops of a primitive agriculturehave been established by the experience of a dozen other countries, and the mostfruitful available to India are : (i) better strains of seeds, (ii) better breeds of animals, (iii) the consolidation of holdings and the limitation of rents, (iv) thedevelopment of co-operative credit (by which the undue power of the moneylendercan be broken), and (v) the development of co-operative selling (and buying).All these policies are being followed to some extent in India already. Whatis needed is a new and more powerful stimulus all along the line. the simultaneous extension and intensification of these five improvements could bringabout an immense increase in the output of the fields.18. The modernisation of peasant agriculture can either be secured (as inRussia) by the practice of ruthless compulsion or (as in France and germany during the 19th century) by the longer paths of peaceful persuasion. It is onlythe second method that can be seriously considered for India. The peasants mustbe shown village by village, and, above all, by practical demonstration in theirmidst, that new practices do not call down the vengeance of angry gods, normerely fail to work, but really do produce more food.To develop this work of technical emancipation it will be necessary to extend,parallel to the educational and nursing service for women, the existing itinerantA agricultural Service, for men. The purpose of this greatly extended&apos; service would be to secure the co-operation of the peasants. Such a service would providea second outlet for the unemployed graduates from Indian Universities, who should, however, be carefully selected for the task. Academic attainment wouldbe less valuable than a real knowledge and sympathy in dealing with the problemsof rural life.19. (iii) Model Villages.The enemy of progress, in India, as elsewhere, is lack of imaginationand faith.It would, therefore, be well to begin with small experimental areas, singlevillages or small groups of villages, that could be richly provided from thebeginning with women teachers, nurses, agronomists and co-operative societies.In such restricted areas the possibility of full emancipation could be demonstratedand &apos;: doubting Thomases &apos;&apos; could find conviction and inspiration.Many experiments of this kind have already been tried particularlyMr. Braynes&apos; campaigns in Gurgaon. The results have often been disappointing,but&apos;this has been due to the temporary nature of the missions to the villages.It is essential that permanent services should be supplied to small areas.20. (iv) Transport to and from the Village.The key to village reconstruction in India is greatly improved transport.Most india villages lack a good road. Yet until satisfactory roads exist thecost (and, in many parts of India, the physical difficulty) of transport will keepthe inhabitants of villages shut in and the rest of the world shut out. Neithereducation and amenities nor tools and implements can come into the village. nor can its produce go out to realise its potential value in the markets of the worldor even in those of nearby country towns. Nothing would do more to raise thestandard of living of the Indian yillage than a great road building campaign inwhich village co-operation should be engaged. Metalled roads, suitable for motor transport, are needed on a large scale, especially in the populous alluvial soilareas. Elsewhere the provision of &quot; kachah &quot; roads by communal effort in the villages, under technical direction provided by the Government, would be a greatstep forward.IV.-The Town Worker.21. It is less easy to see what can be done for the urban worker. The lessons of history in his case are not so plain to read. It is not clear what could havebeen done to ease the lot of the industrial proletariat in the early stages of theIndustrial Revolution, for the fundamental fact is that Urban civilisation cannotbe developed overnight, and the peasant, forced out of the village, does not want to live in the town.[25294] -
Three things, however, might be done :-22. &apos;(i) Factory Legislation. ...A considerable body of enlightened legislation has already been enacted. Thechief need is, therefore, to extend it to the smaller factories (those employing lessthan 10 workers) in which the most appalling conditions continue to exist, and to intensify its observance by an increase in the size of the factory inspectorate.The creation of an efficient inspectorate has always been the crucial administrativeproblem in the development of reasonable conditions in the factory.(ii) Housing and Sanitation.Urban housing conditions in India are extremely bad. In most cities largeslum clearance is necessary, and a good deal more could be done to enforce higher standards of sanitation and to provide cheaper and better housing (in the formof hutments) near the new factories in the less congested cities. This isparticularly important for the seasonal worker from the village who now lives in conditions of appalling squalor. Again, it would be better to concentrate uponproviding a small number of properly equipped housing estates, or permanentcamps, to act as models, rather.than to spread limited resources too thinly overa vast field.(iii) Destitution. .Plainly the development of complex &quot; social services &quot;: with registration,compulsory contributions and covenanted benefits belong to a later stage ofindustrialisation. The stability and understanding of the Indian proletariat isnot yet great enough to make such schemes practicable. But it would seem desirable to provide some permanent relief in kind (the most primitive form ofthe Poor Law) for the destitute and starving in order to supplement private andreligious charity.These measures, though very modest, would do something to improve theconditions of the industrial worker and make the movement from the village tothe town less painful.V. The Promotion and Control of Industrialisation.23.   The fact that India, by the end of the war, will have wiped out herexternal debt and accumulated considerable sterling balances should make it possible to embark on an ambitious programme of capital development without,recourse either to a high degree of forced saving (such as practised in Russiaand other authoritarian countries) or to heavy foreign borrowing.In view of the deeply rooted Indian legend of &quot; the drain,&quot; the resumptionof the traditional forms of external borrowing should be avoided. But this neednot rule out the investment of international funds in India altogether. Suchinvestment may, indeed, be necessary to facilitate socially desirable enterpriseswhere Indian entrepreneurs are not prepared to venture. It may be hoped thatthe mobilisation and direction of British, American and other foreign funds for investment in India (and, indeed, in other undeveloped countries) after the warwill become the responsibility of some organ of the &quot; United Nations.&quot;24. But there is no reason why India should not make use, straightaway,of modern techniques of economic planning and the modern device of the public corporation. In order to avoid the economic distortions which arise fromexaggerated Provincial loyalties, a start should, at once, be made with theconstruction of an A ll-Indian Programme of Industrial Development, into whichcould then be fitted, after negotiations with the Provincial Governments, a seriesof Provincial Programmes. These programmes would consist of a list of projects for the building of railways and roads, the development of sources of power and extending the capacity of the industries that have already been established.The Central and Provincial Governments could maintain control of, and secure consistency in, the programme by offering the protection of theirguarantees for approved and licensed projects and by appropriate creation ofPublic Corporations. These devices could be extended later to the planneddevelopment of new industries.25. Some measures of this kind are absolutely essential if the developmentof Indian industry that has taken place during the war is to continue smoothlyand profitably. They represent an adaptation of Russian and European methodsof planning to the Indian scene. It is understood that a number of promisingstudies of Indian reconstruction problems have already been set on foot by theGovernment of India.   It may well be that these studies will provide the basis
for the programme-building which is needed. They should certainly be givenevery encouragement and assistance. .26. The great success of the scheme for training Indian workers in GreatBritain initiated by the Minister of Labour, under which they have not onlyreceived technical training, but have also obtained a better understanding ofBritish institutions, should be greatly extended without delay. It should be supplemented by other schemes of a similar character so that a large number of indians competent to take posts up to all grades of management may be trainedboth here and in India with close ties with British industrial practice and organisation. A large number of technicians have already been sent to India andtheir number should be increased. Such measures would create goodwill and the inevitable and necessary growth in the industrialisation of India would be accompanied by a growth of personal ties which would be in.the best interests ofboth countries.VI: Finance.27. The proposals for development in village and town are not new, but they require money, and upon this obstacle previous suggestions of this kind have broken down.28. There are, however,, a number of reasons for supposing that financialstringency7 can be overcome or, at least, greatly reduced :-(a) The foreign debt of India is being rapidly repaid and the interest isbeing saved.(b) In spite of greatly increased direct taxation, considerable fortunes arebeing made as a result of war expenditure. There is reason tobelieve that the direct taxes upon landowners could be further increased, and it might not be impossible to raise more from thenormal sources of revenue (i.e.; the peasant) if responsible Govern-ments could really show that disproportionate benefits were accruing to the village. -(c) Small saving is already encouraged by favourable rates of interest, buta vigorous drive to &apos;&apos; mop up &apos;&apos; the savings of &apos;&apos;. small&apos;&apos; people whoseincomes have recently, been greatly increased might produce ahandsome yield. The deeply rooted tradition of borrowing to spendoh marriages, funerals, &amp;c, is one of the great curses of Indian life.Now is the time when propaganda encouraging peasants and handi-craft workers to save for future spending might have great success.29. &quot;What is essential, however, to the success of any far-reaching policy of social reform and development is the availability of funds at the centre whichcan be used to prime provincial pumps, stimulate investigation and experimentand to train personnel.30. It appears that considerable funds are now being set on one side by theGovernment of India for post-war reconstruction purposes. These might be^augmented by the British Government in the form of a grant to an Indian SocialResearch and Development Fund. The present difficulty of making payments inrupees would be avoided, to some extent, if part of the grants made to this fundby the British Government were, for the time being, used to assist Indian studiesin this country. If there was a real programme of social reform and develop-ment in India, it is not out of the question that several American Foundationswould be willing to give financial assistance for the training of personnel,research projects and experimental development work.VII. Procedure.If it were thought desirable to proceed with some such programme as this, itwould be desirable-- *(a) To communicate a Memorandum to the new Viceroy expressing the wishof His Majesty&apos;s Government to pursue a Forward Social programme and to suggest a number of positive measures to be included in it.(5) For a sympathetic and determined Viceroy to formulate in detail, andmobilise considerable Provincial and All-India Support for, such a programme of economic and social improvement.(c) To consider the possibility of holding ah Eastern Regional Conferenceof the International Labour Organisation to discuss some of the issues, such as nutrition, health, labour legislation, &amp;c, touched on in
this Memorandum in a wider setting. If the I.L.O. received an invitation to hold such a Conference in India it should be possiblefor them to arrange for strong visiting delegations from the United -States, China, Australia and New Zealand, as well as from GreatBritain, and Russia (though not a member) might send technicalrepresentatives whose experience would be specially valuable. TheConference would attract a great deal of attention in India and wouldfocus attention on the need for economic and social reforms.In spite of the difficulties in the way of arranging a conference of&quot; this kindin war-time, it is desirable that it should take place before the war comes to anend. If it is* postponed everyone will probably be too busy with the urgentproblems which peace will bring to a head to attend such a conference for at least two years. Even if, as is probably the case, a full-scale conference cannot bearranged during the war, the same effect would be achieved by a meeting in india of the Emergency Committee of the I.L.O., together with small expert delegationsfrom the countries mainly interested.Although it is hardly possible than even a modified conference of this kind could be held sooner than the Autumn of 1948, preparatory studies could be initiated as soon as the decision to hold it was reached. The results of theconference would be certain to strengthen the hand of the new Viceroy and ofeveryone in India seeking to develop a progressive economic and social policy.APPENDIX II.Note by the Secretary of State for India.1. The Note by the Minister of Labour and the Minister of aircraft production recognises in its first sentence that during the last 40 years greatadvances have been made in the social and economic life of India. In an earlier stage of. our discussions I supplied some particulars of the developments whichhave taken place in recent times in regard to agriculture, labour, education, publichealth, &amp;c. There has been a great awakening of practical interest which has.shown itself in widespread activity, and it is certainly true to say that theprogress of the last quarter of a century has greatly exceeded that of any previousperiod. Much of this is the outcome of the reports of. the Royal Commissions on labour and Agriculture, which between them covered practically the whole field of economic livelihood. Within the limited resources available (and here I wouldmention, as an instance of the active desire to promote welfare work, the fundsplaced at the disposal of the Provincial Government for this purpose by theCentre at a time of great financial stringency while Sir James Grigg wasFinance Member of the Government of India) the results have been notable, andthe credit belongs both to the agencies for which we ourselves are responsible^and to the Indian public men who have served in the various Governments andLegislatures. Progress has continued up to the present time, notwithstandingpreoccupation with the war, and the meeting at Delhi in 1942 of the firstTripartite Indian Labour Conference, representing Government, employers andlabour, is a significant example. Welfare work has also been maintained and extended, notwithstanding the political impasse, in those Provinces in which,owing to the policy of the Congress, responsible Ministries have been replaced byofficial Executive Governments.2. It is important always to bear this in mind, because the magnitude ofwhat patently remains to be done is apt to obscure the progress which has been and is being achieved, and to imply that the situation presenting itself to us isa static one, which is far from being true. If it ever was static that has certainly not been the case since the time of Lord Curzon, who set himself a programmevery similar to that which the Ministers propose that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould entrust to the next incumbent of the Viceroyalty. But the opportunitypresented nowadays to a single man, even in so high an office, of effectingimprovements in India in the field of social and economic welfare is not the sameas it was in Lord Curzon&apos;s time, and we should do well to remember the extentto which these matters are now within the responsibility of Indians themselves,and, indeed, have been for the past 20 years.3.&apos; So far as agriculture is concerned and there could be no example of greater practical importance it will be realised that the present Viceroyentered upon his office with a knowledge not only of Indian constitutionalproblems, acquired as Chairman of the Select Committee of both Houses, but also
of agricultural questions, gained as Chairman of the Royal Commission on agriculture in India. No other man could have done as much to promote thedevelopment of Indian agriculture as Lord Linlithgow has done, and his successorcan hardly be expected to do more than follow in his footsteps.4. The centre of gravity in regard to this work lies, under the Act of 1935,and lay to almost the same extent under the Act of 1919, in the Provinces ratherthan at the Centre. That is not to say, however, that the Centre no longer hasany useful function to perform in regard to what are known as &apos;&apos; ProvincialSubjects.&quot; To some extent the Centre has concurrent jurisdiction for the purposeof maintaining general standards and principles, as, for example, in the case oflabour conditions. And in the provinces in which responsible Ministries no longerfunction, under the Act of 1935 a measure of responsibility has reverted to theCentre, represented, however, for this purpose, by the Governor-General ratherthan by the Government of India. Over and above this, even when theconstitutional responsibility, is entirely Provincial and Ministerial, the Centrecan, with the goodwill and co-operation of local governments, in the States aswell as in the Provinces, perform the very useful and practically necessaryfunction of co-ordinating local activities and providing something of the natureof a clearing house for information, experience and advice, which function ithas been possible for the Centre to fortify in some cases and to a limited extentwith practical assistance, financial and otherwise.5. The leading example of this latter type of activity on the part of theCentre is the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. It became evidentduring the currency of the Act of 1919 that the provincialisation of the greaterpart of the social and economic fields of government resulted in a degree ofdecentralisation which, though justified as a means of providing scope for political responsibility, had disadvantages on the practical side. One of the primary achievements of. Lord Linlithgow&apos;s Agricultural Commission was theestablishment of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research as an organ topromote co-ordination and co-operation in agricultural matters, and this organhas proved to be fruitful both in its own field and as an example to be followed inother fields of administration, a process which may still be susceptible of furtherbeneficial development.6. I do not suppose there cam be much doubt that the problem, which in greater or less degree is fundamental to all the ot;io?-;:, is that of education andof primary education in particular. It is difficult, I am afraid, to share theoptimism expressed in the Note of the two Ministers where it says that a programme of the kind suggested in paragraph 13 &apos;&apos; could be started to-morrowif the necessary impulse were given from the Centre. &apos; Education in India hasa long history behind it and a great deal of endeavour has been put into it. yet the results in the field of primary education are of the order that the Ministersindicate, though I think their figure of 11 per cent, in paragraph 1 relates to maleliteracy in 1931. According to the figures of the Census of 1041 which havelately been received, literacy had risen in 1941 to 12-2 per cent,  males 17-4 percent., females 4-7 per cent.) of the total population, including the States, ascompared with 6-9 per cent, in 1931 (males 11-7 per cent., females 1-9 per cent.),and this increase is all the more notable because the total figure for the popula-tion itself has risen by 15 per cent, in the same period. We may hope for greaterprogress in the next decade, but I doubt whether it can be greatly accelerated bythe waving of the Viceregal wand. It is not merely a matter of money and personnel, nor of an impulse such as the Ministers suggest. A much widerrecognition among the people at large of the advantages of education isrequired, and in that connection it may be observed that Hinduism as a system,even if it does not actually stand in the way of the assimilation of the lower tothe higher grades of society by education or any other means, does not exactlyprovide a very favourable atmosphere for the development of that process.Primary education is not, in my view, a subject upon which we British can expect to be able in the conditions of to-day and to-morrow to make any very spectacularcontribution. But I agree that there may well be scope for the development ofsome organisation at the Centre, upon the lines of the Imperial Council ofAgricultural Research, and I am attracted by the idea, which needs to befurther explored, that there are lessons to be learnt from the experience of othercountries in the development of new techniques for the primary education oflarge rural populations. .7. The population problem, including that of birth control (paragraph 7);is one which needs to be approached with circumspection.   It lias, hardly ceased
to be a delicate question among ourselves, and, quite apart from the generalconservatism of popular opinion in India, there is a special delicacy attaching to the idea of restricting the growth of the population in a country where pro-productivity has a high place among the religious tenets of the people. The matteralso has obvious possibilities of communal misunderstanding. By all means let us sound the Indian authorities on this subject, but we should hesitate to putstrong pressure upon them.8. I welcome the reference to small savings in paragraph 28 (c). nothing would be more opportune than a thrift campaign at the present time. One of themost serious problems of the Government of India just now arises from the combination of a superfluity of money to spend and a deficiency of commoditiesavailable for consumption. Moreover, it would be highly advantageous from thepoint of view of the post-war situation, as well as an alleviation of present difficulties, if the small man could be induced to put aside as much as possible ofhis present comparatively abundant income and keep, it for a time when he willbe able to make much better use of it. Inflation would be moderated, post-war reconstruction would be facilitated, and the grip of the moneylender would be weakened. I am sure that the Indian authorities are being active in this matter,but there may be scope for an intensification of their efforts which we should dowell to encourage.9. In Section VII (c) reference is made to a proposal for holding in Indiaan Eastern Regional Conference of the International Labour Organisation todiscuss some of these subjects. This stands on a somewhat different footing, so Iunderstand, from the other proposals in the Memorandum, for the reason thatarrangements for giving effect to it are already being discussed in anothersphere, namely, that of the Governing Body of the I.L.O., upon which the HighCommissioner for India represents the Government of India and is the channel of communication with the Indian authorities. This is a sphere in which india has achieved virtual independence and upon which we should not, I think, bewell advised to intrude. But, subject to that, the proposal is one to which, ifthe Government of India and others concerned can in present conditions makethe necessary practical arrangements, I would unhesitatingly give my support.10. As long as the war lasts there will be little, if any, resources availablein India, whether of personnel or of money, for intensified activities unconnected with the war effort. I am not sure if it is realised to what an extent the Indianadministrative system, both at the Centre and in the Provinces (which, in itshigher ranges, is never more than barely adequate for its normal purposes), hasbeen strained to cope with the special burdens imposed upon it by the war. And,as regards finance, it has already become, and will increasingly become, a matterof serious anxiety to provide for war expenditure in rupees, including that partof the cost of the war in India which is chargeable to the United Kingdom.Even if we were prepared to set aside what would have to. be a very large sum ofmoney for a *velfare programme in India, it would only go to swell the accumulation of Indian sterling balances in London and would do nothing,either now or in the post-war reconstruction period, to assist the financing of measures in India itself.11. My provisional conclusion upon our colleagues&apos; note is that the newViceroy, when appointed, might be charged by His Majesty&apos;s Government to devote as much of his attention as he can to social and economic progress and thereby to do what lies in his power to redress the balance in Indian affairsbetween politics on the one hand and social and economic&apos; progress on the other.This is particularly desirable at a time when reconstruction is so much in the air.I should regard this not so much as the establishment of a new social and economic policy for India as an endeavour to intensify activities inherent in the policy wehave always pursued in that country and not least in the recent pre-war period.12. But before taking any formal decision, and particularly before settingit out in concrete terms, we should fortify ourselves with the views of the Indianauthorities. This seems advisable not only because of their general responsibilitieswithin this field, but also because whatever we do should be in line with theirown plans for post-war reconstruction, which are under active consideration.Accordingly, my suggestion is that I might be authorised to ask the Viceroy (towhom I have already sent these Notes- privately) to furnish us in good time withany comments or suggestions that these Notes elicit from his colleagues and advisers, together with his own.
