THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   Mpril 1943limril 1943 229 &amp;SECRET. / Copy No.   33W.F. (43) 145.April 12, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.New Construction Programme, 1943.EFFECT OF REPLACING FLEET DESTROYERS BY ADDITIONALFRIGATES.(Previous Reference:  W.M. (43) 47th Conclusions, Minute 1 (1).)Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty. -WHEN the War Cabinet approved the bulk of the New construction programme they invited me to consider whether additional Frigates or Corvettescould be substituted for some of the Fleet Destroyers included therein. Thefollowing report on this suggestion is based on a careful review of the shipyardsand fitting-out facilities.Effect on Production.2. It is assumed that the War Cabinet would not wish to hold up vesselsalready ordered and for which material has been collected to enable them to belaid down during the next few months. On this assumption, it is estimated thatthe first Frigate could be laid down towards the end of this year, and a generousestimate is that 10 (replacing six 1942 design, destroyers and, say, fourIntermediate Class) would be completed in the last months of 1944.3. In order to obtain a clear picture of the effect on our Naval strength ofan increase of this order in the number of Frigates completing in 1944, it isnecessary to examine the reactions on ship production generally.4. The Admiralty have now arranged, as far as possible, to concentrate one type of ship in each yard. In this way, the available slips, material, labour andfitting-out berths are used to the best advantage, and the firms get into the swingof repetition production, using their experience to plan ahead so that vesselsfollow one another from launching to the fitting-out berths in continuous rotation.5. All the firms now building destroyers have carefully-worked-outschedules, and the destroyers ordered in the 1942 Programme are planned to launch and fit out at regular intervals throughout 1944. To lay down Frigateswhere it had been planned to lay down Destroyers would mean that, during 1944.these Frigates, which would reach the launching stage in half the time taken bya Destroyer, would be competing for the fitting-out berths and labour with the destroyers of previous programmes. This would delay the completion of destroyers in 1944, and this delay would not be confined to one ship in each case :subsequent ships would also be affected. Thus, to lay down 10 Frigates woulddelay the laying-down of the 10 Destroyers they replaced by at least 5 months, andwould also delay more than 10 Destroyers completing in 1944.[25302]&apos; .     .
6. To this extent the effect on production can be estimated, but the loss of output would, in fact, be more general. Shipyards accustomed to building one type of vessel would undoubtedly lose in efficiency when changing over to a newdesign. Their organisation, both of labour and plant, would be thrown out of balance) In addition to this physical disorganisation, both management and workers would be discouraged by the upset to their programme and to theirsteadily mounting production. / &apos;Effect on Convoy Escort and Destroyer Strengths. -[-7. In the struggle against the U-boat, however, the provision of escort vessels is of such paramount importance that it would&apos;be wrong to determine thequestion raised by the War Cabinet solely on the effect on ship production justdescribed. The relation between requirements and probable strengths in the two categories must also be considered. - - -  -8. The position in January 1945, if the New Construction Programme, 1943,stands in its present form, is estimated as follows : Percentage ofRequirement.     In Service.   Requirement.Escort    Vessels    (includingHunt   Class   and   EscortDestroyers) ...       ...       1,044 755 72Eleet Destroyers      ...       ... 191 98 51These figures take no account of the American production of Escort vessels,of which we expect to receive a large number, estimated at 50 more this year and100 in. 1944 out of an estimated production of 750. If these are added, 86-6 percent, of our requirement will be met by January 1945.9. With Fleet Destroyers, as will be seen, the position is more seri us, andfor the next two .years, assuming our losses are no greater than those so farexperienced, new construction will only be maintaining our present inadequatestrength, for certain of the older vessels will be declassed to Escort Destroyersduring the period.Conclusion.10. It is accordingly considered that the small proportionate increase inthe Escort strength of the United Nations which would result from the proposed change would not compensate for the proportionately greater loss in FleetDestroyer strength and the disadvantageous effects on warship production.A.
