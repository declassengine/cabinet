THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT G&apos;printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 125.March 26, 1943.WAR CABINET.REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON ELECTORAL MACHINERY.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland.IN W.P. (G) (41) 106, circulated to the War Cabinet in October 1941, itwas pointed out that, under the existing system of electoral registration, thepreparation of a register of electors covers a period of some five months, that war conditions had resulted in large-scale shiftings of the population, that at the endof the war it may be expected that many people will move from their war-timehabitations, and that if a register were to be compiled while this movement is?in process many people would be registered in places which they were about toleave and would consequently find a difficulty in voting, because at the time of theelection they would be living at a distance from the place in which they were registered. It was suggested, therefore, that there should be an early enquiry asto the possibility of a special electoral machinery to meet this situation.Subsequently we appointed a Committee containing Members of Parliament/Party Agents and officials.2. This Committee in their report have unanimously recommended that, forthe purpose of post-war elections, a scheme of continuous registration should beintroduced. Under this system the register would be kept continually up to date for parliamentary purposes by a system under which the National registration officers would supply to the Electoral Registration Officers particulars of allpersons who come to reside in or move out of the constituency or attain the ageof 21, &amp;c. The register thus continuously kept up to date would be temporarily&apos;&apos; frozen &apos;&apos; when an election is pending. All persons in the register at the timeof the &quot; freezing &quot; would then be entitled to vote at the election.3. The Committee have also recommended that, should there be a war-timegeneral election a prospect which the. Committee strongly deprecate thereshould be a scheme for enabling voting to be carried out without the compilationof a register. The scheme is that every person of the requisite age should beentitled to vote in the constituency in which is the place of residence shown on his-.National Registration Card. Under this scheme the voter would produce hisNational Registration Card at the polling station and; preferably also sign adeclaration that he is the true holder of the card. The polling officer wouldcompare the signature on the declaration with the signature on the cardj several of the members of the Committee disliked this system of voting without the com-compilation of a register, but agreed to it as a method of conducting a generalelection during the war, because they saw no other means of enabling such an election to be held.4. There are two reasons for introducing legislation on this subject at anearly date. First, even if there is little likelihood of an election during the war,the Prime Minister ought to be in a position, if need arises, to advise a dissolution of Parliament and should not be hampered by the consideration that, if a generalelection were to be held, so large a section of the population would be unable to vote that the results might be felt to be unrepresentative of the national view.[25213] copy No. ^ 5.
Moreover, although it is unlikely, it is conceivable that the House of Commonsmight consider a war-time election right and proper.Secondly, whenever the next general election takes place, arrangements oughtto be made for members of the armed forces who are in the United Kingdom tobe registered as absent voters, so that they may vote by post, and for those whoare abroad to vote by proxy. To distribute to the members of the armed forcesscattered all over the world the necessary forms for the appointment of proxiesand to arrange for these forms to be sent to this country and distributed to theappropriate Registration Offices will take many months. It seems right,therefore, that early arrangements should be made.5. In connection with the preparation of a Bill to give effect to theCommittee&apos;s proposals the following questions arise : ?(a) May it be assumed that after the termination of hostilities the national registration system will be kept in operation for a period which will at least belong enough to include the post-war general election ?(b) At what date ought the work of compiling a continuous register of civilians to be started ? The continuous register scheme will impose a substantial volume of work upon both National Registration Officers - and on electoral registration Officers. The National Registration Officers will, we understand, beheavily burdened in the summer of this year with the issue of new national registration Cards and the work consequent thereon, and it would not bepossible for them to start on the work required for the compilation of a continuous register until about August at any rate. Whether the electoral registration Officers, with their greatly depleted staffs, could then start their share of - the work is doubtful. Once the continuous registration system hasstarted to operate, there will be a continuing flow of work in keeping the registerup to date, and much printing will be incurred. In view of the man-power situation, there are strong arguments for holding that the continuous registra-tion process ought not to be started this year; that the matter should be considerednext year in the light of any further information that may then be available asto the prospects of a general election; and that, if a general election shouldoccur owing to some unforeseeable development before the continuous regis-tration system is in being, recourse must be had for the purposes of such an^election to the emergency scheme recommended by the Committee of voting bymeans of National Registration Cards.(c) At what date ought the preparation of an Armed Forces register to be started ? The preparation of this register will also impose some work on the record offices of the armed forces, on the National Registration Officers and on the electoral Registration Officers, but the volume of work will, of course, be much less than the volume of work involved in compiling a register of civilian electors.The arguments for starting at a comparatively early date to compile a register of the armed forces are, first, that the compilation of this register andthe making of arrangements to enable those who are overseas to appoint proxieswill necessarily take a long time; and, secondly, that, until this register iscompiled, members of the armed forces are prevented from voting not only at ageneral election, but also at by-elections (see paragraph 6 below).On the whole, therefore, it would seem right, even if the preparation of the continuous register of civilians be postponed till next year or later, that steps should be taken at an early date to prepare a register.of the armed forces. Theprocess by which the members of the armed forces become registered in each-constituency would be gradual, but those so registered will be able to vote either by post or by proxy whether at a by-election or a general election. &apos;id) Under the &apos;&apos; continuous registration &apos;&apos; scheme the present qualifyingperiod of residence between fixed dates would be abandoned; and every person who is of the requisite age and has resided for two- months in the con-stituency will be placed on the register as soon as the two months&apos; qualificationmatures. This can be done because the material in the hands of the national registration Officer shows the place of residence and the age.The local government franchise, however, is based not on residence but on&quot;occupation&quot; of premises, and the information available to the national registration Officer does not show whether the holder of a Registration Cardis or is not an &quot;occupier &quot; for the purposes of the local government franchise.Consequently, as the law stands at present the continuous registration scheme could not be operated for the purpose of local elections. The question thereforearises whether in any legislation providing for continuous registration it would
be right to assimilate the local government franchise to the Parliamentary-franchise.(e) If the Parliamentary franchise and local government franchise are notassimilated a canvass will have to be taken for the purpose of compiling theregister of local government electors, and the question then arises whether thecanvass should also be used for the purpose of compiling the register of Parlia-mentary electors. If the two franchises are assimilated the Committeerecommends unanimously that the register should be compiled and maintainedfrom material supplied by National Eegistration Officers. If, however, the twofranchises are not assimilated the majority of the Committee recommend thatthe Parliamentary register should be prepared from National Registrationsources on a continuous basis, and that the local government electorate should be ascertained annually on the basis of a canvass. A minority, however, prefer thata register for both Parliamentary and local government purposes should be com^piled on the basis of an annual canvass and the issue of householder forms, andshould between these annual reviews be kept continuously up to date for parliamentary purposes by the use of the National Registration material.If, therefore, it is decided that the Bill to implement the Committee&apos;sproposals should not assimilate the local government franchise with the Parlia-mentary franchise, it will be necessary to decide between the majority andminority recommendations.(/) The question whether there is to be any change in thewoting age mustbe settled. Some representations have been made from time to time that those persons under the age of 21 who are serving with the forces ought to be allowedto vote. Seeing that under the National Service Act some of the young peopleunder this age have been directed into civilian employments it would be verydifficuljt to justify a distinction between persons serving in the forces and personscontributing to the war effort in other ways.. The objections to any lowering of the age for voting are strong, and probably it will be agreed that there shouldbe no change in this respect.(g) It would seem desirable that the proposed legislation should be limitedto a post-war election and, if need should arise, to a general election occurringduring the war, and should not be regarded as committing Parliament to a lastingchange in the scheme of electoral machinery. The question, therefore, will arisewhether the provisions for continuous registration should be operative for oneyear only and should be renewable by the Expiring Laws Continuance Act.By-Elections.6. The Committee did not deal with the question of by-elections. Personsnow unable to vote at by-elections are (a) those who have attained the age of 21since the register of 1939 was compiled, of whom many are in the armed forces and some are civilians; (b) those members of the armed forces who are stationed at a distance from the constituency in which they are registered; and (c) thosecivilians who have moved and are living at a distance from the constituency inwhich they are registered.As regards the armed forces, if it be decided to start the preparation as early as possible of an Armed Forces Register, particulars will gradually reach the Electoral Registration Officers, both of members of the armed forces who are serving at home and of those who are serving overseas. The process will be slowand it will be a long time before the forms for the appointment of proxiessent to men stationed in distant parts of the world can reach the appropriateElectoral Registration Officer. The question will therefore arise whether the names as they come in to the Electoral Registration Officer should be put on theregister, with the result that if an early by-election takes place those who have got on to the register at that date will be able to vote, or whether the right to vote should not be exercisable by any members of the armed forces until a datehas been reached at which the register is as nearly as possible complete.Special arrangements to enable the Services to vote would, however, be inequitable to the civilian in by-elections unless all civilians of age were entitledto vote, e.g., on the identity card system.As regards civilians, it does not seem justifiable to hasten the introductionof the continuous registration system for the purpose of enabling civilians to voteat by-elections. Whenever the process of compiling the continuous register startsit must operate throughout the whole country, and it does hot seem right thata process involving so large a volume of work should be set going in six hundredconstituencies in order to meet the possibility of by-elections occurring in somescore of constituencies.[25213] &quot;    b 2
If this be agreed the question arises whether the emergency scheme suggestedby the Committee for a war-time general election of voting by the production ofNational Registration Cards should be made applicable to by-elections. Underthis scheme no register of electors is compiled and no machinery will exist for sending notifications to each voter as to his appropriate polling station. Asthe Committee point out in their report, voters will thus have some difficulty in finding the right polling station without in some cases first visiting the wrong one;and it will be necessar)?- for as much publicity as possible to be secured by the exhibition of posters and otherwise for the guidance of electors to the right pollingstation.The Committee also point out that the novel procedure of obtaining adeclaration from the voter, examining his identity card and comparing the twosignatures, will take longer than the existing method of tracing and! marking offthe entry of the voter in the register, and that, it will &quot; doubtless be foundnecessary for more than one day to be allowed for polling.&quot; Even if the pollingis spread out over two days many voters will arrive at the last hour, and the comparatively lengthy time taken under this scheme in dealing with each voterwill increase the risk that numbers of would-be voters may be shut out when thepc-lling station closes.Despite these objections, the system of voting by National Registration Cardsseems to be the only method of enabling civilians who would otherwise bedisfranchised to vote at a by-election, and the choice appears to be betweenapplying this scheme to future war-time by-elections, or adhering to the viewthat for the purpose of by-elections the register of 1939 must suffice.Redistribution.7. The Departmental Committee dealt also with the technical problems involved in any scheme of redistribution.   They recommend that there should be. in existence some.....sj^anding machinery for redistributing the Parliamentary1 constituencies as and when need arises owing to changes in the population. Thesystem by which redistribution only takes place at long intervals, with the resultthat in the intervening periods there may be much mal-distribution, is open tostrong objection, and there would be obvious advantages in creating some machinery by which redistribution could be effected in accordance with settledprinciples whenever need arises. The question, therefore, deserves consideration whether in any proposed legislation provision should be made for the creationof such standing machinery. The Committee propose that there should beStatutory Commissions respectively for England and &quot;Wales and Scotland, ofwhich the Speaker should be Chairman, and that the Commissions should compriseDepartmental members representing the Home Office and Scottish Office, theMinistry of Health, the Registrars-General for England and Wales and forScotland, and the Director-General of the Ordnance Survey Department.On the question whether there- would be any advantage in.setting on foota scheme of actual redistribution during the war, the Committee made no recommendation. It is recognised that any scheme of redistribution effectedduring the. war could be only partial and limited and that a further redistributionwould be necessary when the population has settled down after the expected post-war changes. It is open to question whether it is worth while to undertake witha view to a post-war election a partial and limited scheme of redistribution, andit may be better to postpone any actual redistribution until a date some time after the termination of hostilities, when the large-scale shifting of populationthat is to be expected has come to an end. If, however, this view be acceptedthere nevertheless remains the question whether there should be included in theproposed Bill provisions creating standing machinery for the purposes of redistribution and directing that actual redistribution shall wait till a later date.8. The questions therefore for settlement by Ministers may be summarisedas follows : (1) Will the National Registration system be kept in being for a sufficiently long period to cover a post-war general election ?(2) Shall the preparation of the Register for the Armed Forces be started atan early date 1Shall, however, the use of this Register be deferred until a date at which it is nearing completion, or shall use be made of it at anyby-election, despite the fact that particulars of a proportion only ofmembers of the Armed Forces who will be entitled to vote in thatconstituency may at that date have reached the Electoral registration officer?
(3) Shall the preparation of the continuous registration scheme be postponedand treated as a matter for consideration next year at the earliest ?&apos;4) Shall the Bill provide for the assimilation of the Parliamentary and localgovernment franchises ?(5) If the two franchises are not assimilated, should the majority or the minority recommendations of the Departmental Committee be acceptedon the method of preparing the Parliamentary and local governmentregisters respectively?(6) Is it agreed that there shall be no change in the voting age ?(7) Is the Bill to provide that the system of voting by the production of aNational Registration Card shall be applied not only to a war-timegeneral election, should one occur, but also to any by-elections?(8) Shall the Bill contain provisions as to machinery for redistribution, butprovide that actual redistribution shall wait till a later date ?9. We append a copy of a letter which has been received fromSir Richard Acland.10. Unless the Cabinet may feel that in view of the possible Parliamentaryurgency an immediate decision ought to be taken on such of these questions asaffect war-time by-elections, V&amp; would suggest that for the purpose of giving further consideration to the problems which are raised by the report of theCommittee, a small Sub-Committee of the Cabinet should in the first instance beappointed.H. M.T. J.March 26, 1943.
My dear Morrison, March 24, 1943.Mr. ATTLEE very kindly replied to me in the House when I rather naughtilyraised the&apos; issue of election registers without notice; but he now tells methat, if I want to take the matter further, I should refer to you.I can make my points very briefly. The figures in recent by-elections, taken with the actual experience accumulated in our committee rooms, show beyond doubt that citizens want to vote. Thejr are bewildered and amazed to find thatthe state of the register prevents so many of them from doing so. It is not mycase that there is any possibility of doing anything which would make the registerperfect. It is my case that there are all sorts of things that could be done quiteeasily to make it far better.Mr. Attlee asks me to put constructive proposals before you, and I will therefore do so.(1) Instead of offering to each soldier permission to put himself on the absentvoters&apos; list if he has the cheek to make himself unpopular in his orderly roomby trying to do so, you could order all commanding officers to put all men on theirabsent voters&apos; lists. This would not enable soldiers overseas to vote. But it wouldenable their colleagues in this country to do so.  ..... .(2) The A.R.P. services, I believe, could compile a register in one week, which,though not perfect, would be far better than those which we use.(3) Almost the same effect could be achieved by examining the lists ofregistered customers at shops selling rationed goods.(4) Alternatively, you could allow people to go and register themselves either at the post office, the police station, or, as I think would be better, at the-A.R.P. post.(5) &quot;You should, I believe, appoint an officer for each by-election with powerto make arrangements designed to enable citizens to vote. Take this examplefrom Portsmouth. About 2,000 workers from the docks had lived in 1935 withinhalf a mile.of the docks and were therefore registered there. The area was whollyblitzed and the workers now live 4 to 6 miles away. Naturally, buses leavethe dock gates some quarter of an hour after the hooter blows to take them home.Some three days before polling day someone wakes up to the situation and asksthe bus compay to run the buses three-quarters of an hour later on polling day.They don&apos;t. Therefore 2,000 people must either not vote or walk 8 to 12 miles.You need an officer with authority to look out for points like this and insist onthe necessary arrangements in advance.I appreciate that proposals (2), (3) and (4) would make it impossible to publish many copies of the register before the election. I think one copy couldbe open for inspection a week before polling clay. Candidates would simply haveto send one - election address to &apos;&apos; the occupiers &apos;&apos; of each house taking theaddresses from the old register and standing their own racket for housing estatesbuilt since 1935. This would save paper, and as postmen could be instructed toput one in every letter box it could even be worked without causing the candidatesto deflect energy from the war effort to the addressing of envelopes.I do not expect to hear from you accepting any or all of these suggestionsout of hand. The specific question I want to ask is this apart from any long-term policy which you may be developing for the register as a whole, will you meetme fairly soon for practical discussion of the steps that could be taken now toimprove the matter in those constituencies where by-elections are contested ? Ithink this is a question which I might expect you to answer either before, or onthe occasion of, the moving of the next by-election writ.Yours sincerely,/SiPTIPrl^ T?TPTJ A TTy   \m 4MT1^uigjicUy XVj. vjj.j_iij.ujj      vjJjxj.1\ U.
