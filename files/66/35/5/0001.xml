THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1943,SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 105.March 10, 1943.WAR CABINET.THE UNITED KINGDOM IMPORT PROGRAMME.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.THE Lord Presidents Committee having completed a review of the importprospects for the first half of the current year, my colleagues desire me to bringspecially to the notice of the War Cabinet the salient features of the position asset out below.2. In their Fourth Report (W.P. (43) 28) the Shipping Committee estimatedour non-tanker import requirements during the first half of 1943 at 12-5 M. tons, ofwhich 5 - 5 M. tons were to be food, 6 - 0 M. tons materials and 1 - 0 M. tons munitions and miscellaneous. Imports realised during January and forecast for February,March and April are much below the level needed to meet these requirements.In January we imported 531,000 tons of food and 537,000 tons of materials.During February, March and April imports are forecast at 2 - 4 M. tons of food and 2-2 M. tons of materials.3. On this basis, food imports during January to April are likely to amount to 2-9 M. tens as against requirements of 5-5 M. tons during the sixmonths January to June,- leaving 2-6 M. tons to be imported in May and June.Thus, to achieve the target set by the Shipping Committee, the average monthlyrate of food imports in May and June would need to be 1-3 M. tons comparedwith an actual import of some 530,000 tons in January and an average monthlyimport of 800,000 tons forecast for February, March and April.4. On the same basis material imports during January to April are likelyto amount to 2-7 M. tons as against requirements of 6-0 M. tons during the sixmonths January to June, leaving 3-3 M. tons to be imported in May and June.Thus, to achieve the target set by the Shipping Committee the average monthlyrate of material imports in May and June would need to be 1 - 65 M. tons ascompared with an actual import of some 540,000 tons in January and a monthly average import of 730,000 tons forecast for February, March and April.5. In short, in order to achieve the target set by the Shipping Committee,it would be necessary during May and June for our food imports to be at a monthly rate nearly twice as great as, and for our material imports to- be at a monthly rate more than twice as great as, the average monthly rate likely to beachieved for the first four months. It is improbable that so great an improvementwill occur.6. In considering these figures it is, of course, necessary to bear in mind that the Shipping Committee&apos;s estimate of our import requirements assumedinter alia a level of food stocks at mid-1943 some 400,000 tons and a level ofmaterial stocks some 2-3 M. tons above minimum distributional levels. This,however, represents the margin which it was considered only prudent tomaintain in order to meet disturbances to our import programme resulting fromthe sudden demands likely to be made from time to time on our. shipping resources in respect of military operations.[25148]
7. The Shipping Committee will shortly be presenting their Fifth Report, inwhich shipping prospects for the remainder of 1943 will be surveyed. It ispossible that, in the light of that report, urgent decisions will require to be taken.Meanwhile, we have thought it desirable to bring to the notice of the War Cabinetthe disquieting picture presented by United Kingdom import prospects for thefirst six months of 1943 so far as they can at present be foreseen.. ffi &apos;        J- A.Privy Council Office,Great George Street, S.W. 1,March 10, 1943.
