Dasher (Escort Carrier) has been blown up in the Clyde.U.S. and Japanese forces have been in action in the North Pacific.Two U-boats have probably been sunk and others damaged.Only one ship has been reported torpedoed in the North-Western Approachesduring the week.   Elsewhere shipping losses have been moderate.Home Waters.2. On the night of the 27th/28th, M.G.Bs. 606, 607 and 603 attacked a shipescorted by two armed trawlers off Egmund (Holland) and probably sank one ofthem.   Our casualties were two ratings slightly wounded.During the following night a force of about 12 E-boats was attacked byH.M. Destroyers Windsor and Blencathra and M.G.Bs. 333 and 321 off the east coast. Two E-boats were sunk and at least three damaged. Our forces sustainedno casualties and only slight damage to M.G.B. 333.3. On the 27th, H.M.S. Dasher (Escort Carrier) sank in the Firth of Clydefollowing an internal explosion. Thirty-six officers, including the Captain, and116 ratings were rescued.4. On the 30th, H.M.S. Glasgow, on patrol north-west of Iceland (C),intercepted the German blockade-runner Regensburg (8,068 tons) which wasinward-bound from Rangoon. The Regensburg was scuttled and six survivorswere picked up.5. On two nights of the week Naval aircraft, co-operating with the R.A.F.,probably sank an E-boat in the Channel and damaged another off the East Coast.Mediterranean..6. Two human torpedoes attempted to enter Mers-el-Kebir (Oran) onthe 23rd.   One was destroyed and no attack was made.The French escort vessel Sergeant Gouarne was torpedoed and sunk west of Oran on the 26th.H.M. Submarine Thunderbolt is overdue from patrol and must be consideredlost.Black Sea.7.   Russian warships have sunk an enemy transport of 2,000 tons.Indian Ocean.8. The Dutch Submarine 0.21 sank a 4,000-ton ship off Port Blair(Andaman Islands) on the 13th.Pacific.9. On the 25th, a U.S. force consisting of two cruisers and four destroyers,when south-west of Altu Island (Aleutians), sighted a Japanese force consistingof four cruisers, four destroyers and two transports. In the ensuing action(details of which are not available) it is reported that one enemy heavy cruiserwas hit by gunfire and probably by a torpedo, and that a light cruiser was damaged.   Some damage was sustained by U.S. ships.Anti-Submarine Operations.10. Forty-nine attacks have been made on U-boats during the week; 25 by aircraft and 24 by surface craft. Two U-boats were probably sunk, six probably damaged and two possibly damaged.On the 25th a Fortress (B. 17) probably sank a U-boat west of the Faeroes,and on the following day another was probably sunk by a Wellington north of cape Ortegal. H.M. Destroyers Tartar and Quantock probably damaged aU-boat north-west of Oran. On the 27th a Fortress (B. 17) probably damaged a U-boat north of Rockall, and on the following day another was probably damaged by a Wellington north of Cape Ortegal.
Two U-boats, in contact with a homeward-bound convoy, were attacked and damaged by H.M.S. Hurricane (destroyer) south-east of Cape Farewell andanother U-boat was possibly damaged in the same area by a Liberator (B. 241).One U-boat was probably damaged and another possibly damaged by aircraft offthe south-east coast of Spain.11. During March it is estimated that nine German U-boats have been sunk and over 24 damaged, and that two. Japanese U-boats have been sunk andtwo damaged.Enemy Intelligence.German.12.   On the 27th air reconnaissance showed that only nurnberg was in the narvik area, and it is possible that the other ships have moved further North.The A admiral Scheer has left Wilhelmshaven since the 23rd.Italian.- 13. During the week about 10,000 tons of shipping arrived in Tunisia from italy.Japanese.14. Before the engagement off Attu Island a Japanese force, consisting ofone 14&quot; battleship, two heavy cruisers and two converted aircraft-carriers,had been reported in the North Pacific. The estimated strength of the japanese forces in the South Pacific is : three 16&quot; battleships, six heavy cruisers, eightlight cruisers, twelve seaplane-carriers and three converted aircraft-carriers.There were 64 ships, including .36 merchant ships, at Rabaul on the 26th.U-boats. -15. About 100 U-boats have been operating in the Atlantic during the week,the majority of which have continued to be concentrated on the Northern convoyroutes. There has been sonie^ activity south of the Canaries and in theMediterranean.Protection of Seaborne Trade..16. During the week ending the ,28th/29th 913 ships were convoyed. Ofthese, 214 were in ocean convoys and 699 in British coastal convoys.Seventy-four destroyers (including 17 U.S. destroyers), 108 sloops, cutters,corvettes and frigates (including three U.S. cutters), one ocean boarding vesseland four auxiliary aircraft-carriers (including three U.S. auxiliary aircraft-carriers) were employed on escort duties.A supporting escort group of destroyers was instrumental in preventing ahattack by over 15 U-boats on two homeward-bound convoys in an area south-east of Greenland.During the week ending midnight the 28th 139 ships, in five ocean convoys,arrived in Home Waters.   Twenty ships were lost.17. During the week ending the 27th imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy totalled 883,000 tons compared with 811,000 during the previous seven days and an average of 516,000 tons during the past ten weeks. Of theweek.&apos;s imports, 256,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.18. During the week U-boats torpedoed 15 ships, of which 10 are known tohave sunk.A homeward-bound convoy from West Africa was attacked N.W. ofFinisterre and five ships were torpedoed, four of which sank. Three ships, in asouthbound convoy, were sunk south of the Canaries. One independently routedship was torpedoed off Recife, another off Freetown, and a straggler from ahomeward-bound convoy was torpedoed in the N.W. Approaches.One ship in a convoy, to Tripoli (L) was sunk off Derna and two ships in awestbound convoy were sunk west of Algiers. One ship in another westboundconvoy was torpedoed west of Oran.[25242] B
In the Western Mediterranean one shi p was sunk in Algiers harbour by air attack and two ships in an eastbound convoy were hit, one of which sank. one ship was sunk and another damaged during an air attack on shipping in Oro Bay(New Guinea).One ship was mined off Tripoli (L) but reached port.British Minelaying.19. During the week surface craft laid mines in the Channel. Aircraft laidmines off the German North Sea coast and off Biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.20. There does not appear to have been any enemy minelaying in home waters during the week, although E-boats were operating off the East Coast on one night and aircraft were over the Thames Estuary on another.Thirty-four moored mines have been destroyed in the Tripoli (L) area.The mine totals are 4,232 ground and 2,407 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.21. An unknown ship escorted by destroyers arrived in the Bay of Biscayduring the night of the 30th/31st and is presumed to have been an inward-boundblockade-runner. It is probable that two outward-bound blockade-runners have left Bordeaux during the week.The ships engaged in the ore trade in the Bay of Biscay have been very active.The German s.s. Cap Guir (1,536 tons) was mined in the Baltic on the 25th.The Roumanian s.s. Alba Julia (5,701 tons) arrived at Istanbul on the 30th,and the Italian tanker Celeno (3,741 tons) left Imbros on the 29th for the Piraeus.MILITARY SITUATION.Tunisia.(An outline map is included as an inset.)First A rmy.22. In the Northern Sector activity has again been confined principally tothe Djebel Abiod-Tamera area, where earlier our forces had been driven backto the hills west of Djebel Abiod. On the morning of the 28th we attacked astride the Djebel Abiod-Sedjanane road and, although we were hampered by difficultweather conditions, the village of Sedjanane was successfully occupied onthe 30th. About 800 prisoners were taken during the course of this operation.Enemy counter-attacks were unsuccessful. Elsewhere in the British sectoractivity has been confined to patrolling.The French in the Central Sector have kept up a series of vigorousreconnaissances in force west of Pichon, and have taken prisoners. Ori the29th they captured the heights south-west of Pichon.U.S. Forces.23. In the Southern Sector thrusts towards the sea have progressed along the Gafsa-Gabes road and east of Maknassy. Dust and haze made visibility poorand this hampered operations.The forces advancing east of Gafsa had successfully withstood several enemycounter-attacks when, on the morning of the 28th, they started an attack to capture the high ground south of the Gafsa-Gabes road; their advance was stubbornlycontested, but by the evening of the 28th they had partially succeeded in their objectives. Since then little progress has been made owing to determined enemyrearguard action and minefields. Their line now runs from the eastern end ofDjebel Berda north across the road to the east of Bou Harnran; they are thusabout 50 miles from the sea in this sector.In the Maknassy region progress was also slow. On the morning of the27th U.S. forces closed on Fondouk and by the end of the day had entered thetown encountering only slight resistance. By the 30th the capture of the townbad been consolidated and fresh positions were taken up some miles south-east of the town and. about 30 miles from&apos; the coast.
French South Algerian Command.24. Further south, French forces operating north of the Chott Djerid have,like the U.S. forces to their- immediate north, encountered strong enemy resistance, but by the 30th patrols were reported on the Bou Oum Ali-Kebili road.South of the Chott Djerid; detachments of the French Camel Corps occupied Douzon the 28th, and by the 31st. Kebiii was also in their possession.Eighth Army.25. By the 23rd it was apparent that most of the bridgehead that our troopsbad secured across the Wadi Zigzaou had been lost to the enemy&apos;s fierce counter-attacks. General Montgomery decided accordingly not to persevere further withthe infantry attacks on the Mareth Line, but rather, to strengthen the forcesengaged in the outflanking.movement to the north-west. An armoured formationwas therefore despatched to reinforce this force, and an infantry division was moved to secure its supply lines through the passes in the Matmata hills. Onthe 25th this armoured formation, joined the outflanking forces in the area west of Djebel Melab, and on the following day a powerful attack was launched withthe object of capturing the high ground dominating the Kebiii-El Hama roadwhere it passes between Djebel Tebaga and Djebel Melab. This attack was completely successful and the newly-arrived armoured formation was able to pass through a gap which was made and advance to within three miles of El Hamma.In a large measure this success was due to the magnificent close supportreceived from the R.A.F.During the 27th our infantry continued mopping-up operations after the big attack of the previous day, while infantry formations supported by tanksmoved north-west towards Gabes. By 1100 hours on the 29th, forward troops from these forces entered Gabes. Meanwhile, the infantry division located onthe Matmata hills also moved: towards Gabes, and the forces on the coast which,finding the Mareth Line positions undefended, moved forward on Gabes makingcontact with the infantry advancing from1 the Matmata hills. During the after-noon of the 29th our light armoured forces pushed! on towards Oudref and madecontact with enemy rear guards in this area. By midday on the 30th our patrols were in contact with the enemy in the hills north of the Oudref-El Guettar road.The Russo-German Campaign.(An outline map of the operations is included as an inset;)Northern Sector.26. Russian attacks south of Lake Ladoga have continued and the Germansrefer to heavy defensive fighting in this area. In the Lake Ilmen area theRussians have gained local successes but have been badly hindered by the thaw.It is now known that through railway communication has been established with Leningrad.&apos; - &quot;Central Sector.27.   As a result of a slight further advance the Russians have now reached a point 50 miles west of Vyasma.   The Germans are resisting strongly.The roads are reported to be in bad condition.Orel-Kursk Sector. ..28; In the Shizdra area, German attacks at the beginning of the period under review were unsuccessful and have been followed by a period of comparativequiet. Further German attacks south-west of Orel have resulted in the capture of Sievsk.Kharkov Sector.29. The Germans have attempted without success to press northwards fromByelgorod. The Russians have reported unsuccessful German attempts - to cross the Donetz north of Chuguyev but the scale of these attacks is not clear.The Donetz is still frozen but cannot be crossed on foot, and the ice is likelyto break in the near future.Taman Bridgehead.30. The German bridgehead has been further contracted by the Russianoccupation of Slavyanskaya and Abinskaya.[25242]    , - &apos; 9 b 2
Summary.31. Fighting has been confined to a few comparatively small sectors, and thegreater part of the front has been quiet. It seems likely that quiet conditionswill prevail throughout the mud period and that no major operations will takeplace until the ground dries; on the greater part of the front this is likely to betowards the end of April, but it will probably be earlier in the extreme South.Burma.Arakan.&apos; 32. East of the Mayu Hills an enemy force, now estimated at two battalions,has succeeded in crossing the Mayu River and has attacked our positions inthe Nanra area (on the Maysu Peninsula about nine miles N.W. of Rathedaung).Enemy forces in increasing numbers are on features north of our positions.Our forces in this area have been reinforced.East of the Mayu River, where our troops hold defensive positions in theTaungmaw area, there has been no change in the situation.Upper Burma.33. The Kachin levies continue to attack the Japanese north of Myitkyinawhere the latter are operating in area of Sumpraburn.South-West Pacific.New Guinea.34. In clashes with the enemy in the Mubo area (10 miles south ofSalamaua) Australian patrols killed 21 Japanese on the 28/29th March.AIR  SITUATION.General Review.35. A total of 3,700 tons of bombs was dropped during attacks on Berlin,Duisburg, St; Nazaire, Rouen and other objectives on the Western Front.In Tunisia, operations were again on a heavy scale and full support wasgiven to our land forces.Cagliari&apos;s harbour and airfields in Sardinia were, heavily bombed by U.S.Fortresses (B. 17).United Kingdom.36. Twenty-two enemy aircraft flew over this country by day and 22 by night. Others operated off our coasts. Fighters destroyed four and damagedthree.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.37. Two effective attacks on Rotterdam were made by a total of 58 escortedVenturas (B. 34), which dropped 63 tons of bombs; buildings in the Wilton andNieuve Waterweg shipyards were hit and a number of barges and a minesweeperin the docks were damaged. Eighty-eight tons of bombs were released on thesame target during a high-level attack by 33 Fortresses (B. 17), carried out inunfavourable weather.Escorted Venturas (B. 34) also successfully bombed the railway centre a*tAbbeville and rail tracks near Dordrecht.. Mosquitoes raided the Stork engineer-ing works at Hengelo (where hits were seen on the boiler, machine-turning andengine-erecting shops) and Philips electro-chemical plant at Eindhoven (wherebombs, dropped from a low level, fell in the south-west corner of the target.From the above operations, four escorting Spitfires are missing. OneLiberator (B. 24), despatched to Rotterdam, did not return.Seventy Fortresses (B. 17), supported and covered by squadrons of fighters,made an accurate and concentrated attack on Rouen (Sotteville) railway centre;209 tons of bombs were dropped.   The Fortresses (B. 17), one of which is missing,
destroyed five enemy fighters and damaged or destroyed eight more. FourSpitfires from one of the rear-support squadrons were shot down.Aircraft of Fighter and Army Co-operation Commands carried out a seriesof disruptive raids on communications and other objectives in France, belgium and Germany. Whirlwind bombers operating: against Abbeville railway centrereported that many bombs hit their target. A Mosquito attacked five goods trains,two military lorries, two barges and a tug near Meppen in Western Hanover.Fighters and fighter-bombers seriously damaged electric transformer stationsnear St. Lo, Guilmecourt and Courtrai; lock-gates at Ouistreham were hit andthree locomotives were destroyed and at least thirteen others were damaged.Nights .38. Berlin was heavily raided twice. On the first night, 329 aircraftdropped 852 tons of H.E. bombs and incendiaries. On the second, severe icingand heavy cloud en route caused some aircraft to return early but 213 aircraftreached their objective and nearly 530 tons were released. In both these opera-tions visibility over the target was good except for industrial haze and, though in the early phases bombing was somewhat scattered, good concentrations of fires were seen as the attacks developed. These fires were mainly in the vicinity ofAlexander Platz and to the north, east and south-west of the city centre.Four hours prior to the second Berlin attack, a force of Wellingtons was overBochum, the important industrial and railway centre near Essen. Ninety-seven aircraft dropped 140 tons of bombs after the Pathfinders had accurately markedthe aiming points. A number of the resultant fires appeared, in the later stages,to be gaining hold and a notably large explosion was seen by several homingaircraft when 90 miles from the target.Over 930 tons of bombs were dropped at Duisburg during a blind-bombing attack on this inland port by 387 aircraft. The city was obscured by densecloud upon which the glow of dispersed fires was reflected.St. Nazaire was bombed by 295 aircraft. Favourable weather conditionsenabled the crews to distinguish ground details during the earlier stages; later,observation was obstructed by smoke from an artificial screen and from the largenumber of fires which were started. These, which spread and increased in intensity, were concentrated around the markers which had been placed withgreat precision.   Over 700 tons of H.E. bombs and incendiaries were dropped.Fifty-one of our aircraft are missing from the 1,660 sorties despatched onthe above operations.Coastal Operations. ,39. Aircraft o&apos;f Bomber Command, of which 38 were despatched, laid124 sea-mines in enemy waters.Operations against enemy surface vessels were hampered by bad weather.Mediterranean.Tunisia.40. The Allied Air Forces continued to provide the maximum support forour land forces.In the Southern Sector heavy and sustained attacks were made on concentra-tions of enemy troops, tanks and M.T. The weight of the attacks by bombers maybe gauged from the following : (a) 183 tons of bombs were dropped on enemy concentrations in the El Hamma area on the night the 25th/26th, (b) 110 tons were dropped on enemy concentrations in the Gabes area on the night the26th/27th, and (c) 110 tons were dropped on enemy M.T. retreating along theGabes-Sfax Road on the night the 28th/29th.Fighter-bombers and fighters contributed very considerably to the success ofthe operations. For example, on the 26th about 110 enemy vehicles were destroyed and 200 were damaged in the El Hamma area, and on the 29th, 50 vehicles were destroyed and 270 were damaged on the Gabes-Sfax road. In addition, a railwaytrain, road and railway bridges, tanks, guns and petrol dumps were destroyed,and heavy casualties were inflicted on enemy troops.Heavy day and night attacks were made on enemy airfields, especially in theSfax area; many enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground. During a raid onthe airfield at La Fauconnerie (35 miles N.W. of Sfax), enemy fighters attempted to intercept, but Spitfires, -without loss to themselves, destroyed 11, probably destroyed five and damaged four.
In the Northern Sector, fighter-bombers attacked enemy troops and tanks inthe Medjez El Bab area, and U.S. Mitchells (B. 25) attacked fuel installations atGrombalia (23 miles S.E. of Tunis).The docks at Ferryville were bombed by 21 U.S. Fortresses (B. 17); onemedium and two small ships were hit. Other Fortresses attacked the docks atSousse, dropping 60 tons of bombs; a small ship was sunk and another was hit.Bisleys bombed the docks at Sfax.Allied fighters flew numerous offensive patrols and reconnaissances and provided protection for shipping.The main weight of the G.A.F. attack was directed on the Southern Sector.Dive-bombers and ground attack aircraft, escorted by fighters, carried out offensive operations against artillery^ positions, tanks, M.T. and trooP concentrations.Towards the end of the week there was a general decline, in offensive operations in this sector as a result of the German withdrawal north of Gabes, and althoughsmall attacks by Ju. 87s and fighters were continued, operations became primarilyof,a defensive role because of intensive Allied attacks on enemy airfields.Italy, Sicily and Sardinia.41. The &quot;train ferry terminus at Messina was attacked three times by liberators (B. 24), which dropped 109 tons of bombs. Naval fuel installations and the whole area of the railway yards were set on fire and bursts were seen nearworkshops and a power station.    .Four Spitfires successfully attacked a train near Pozzallo on the South coast of Sicily and a Marauder (B. 26) sank a barge off the North Coast.Mosquitoes attacked railways in Southern Italy. Four electric trains were damaged between Rome and Naples, and five locomotives were destroyed or damaged on the coastal railway between Cutro and Locri. The station buildings at Lamezia (60 miles N.E. of Reggio Calabria) were set on fire.A TJ.S. Liberator (B. 24) attacked a chemical factory at Cotrone, droppingnearly three tons of bombs in the middle of the factory area and on railwaysidings-.&apos; Another Liberator bombed the airfield at Vibo Valentia (42 miles NN.E.of Reggio Calabria).On the 31st, 95 U.S. Fortresses (B. 17), escorted by Lightnings (P. 38),attacked Cagliari harbour and airfields; several ships in the harbour and manyenemy aircraft, on the ground were hit. Fourteen enemy aircraft were shot down.   All the U.S. aircraft returned safely.Russia.42. Unfavourable weather, conditions considerably hampered air operations in Russia. 8Most of the Russian activity was on the Northern Front and in the Kuban,with some defensive operations in the Donetz Sector.In the North, Russian aircraft continued their attacks-on ports in the gulf of Finland. Tallinn (Reval) was raided several times with considerable success;the town was severely damaged and a German ship of 800 tons was sunk in the harbour. Three German transports, totalling 6,000 tons, were sunk in theBarents Sea.In the Kuban, the Russian Air Force made daily attacks on front line troops and &apos; on the towns of Krimskaya, Anastasyevskaya and Varenkovskaya. Anenemy ship of 7,000 tons was sunk in the Black Sea.The German Air Force carried out their usual harassing raids on Murmansk.In Central and Southern Russia, the main weight of the G.A.F. was con-centrated in the Donetz Basin, where support was given to troops in theirattempts to secure bridgeheads on the east bank of the Donetz in the Byelgorodand Chugujev sectors. Attacks were also made against Russian lines of com-munications, particularly railways, the importance of which has increased now that roads are practically impassable.In the far south, German aircraft based in the Crimea continued to givesupport to the defensive fighting in the Taman Peninsula.India and Burma.43. Strong support was provided for our forward troops in the MayuRiver area and, in addition to numerous small raids over a wide area, thefollowing  operations  on  an  appreciably  heavier  scale were  carried  out.
Liberators (B. 24) and Fortresses (B. 17) again damaged tJhe approaches toMyitnge bridge (a vital link in the railway system connecting Mandalay withToungoo and Rangoon) and bombed another bridge in the same area as well asthe bridge at Ava, 21 miles W.S.W. of Mandalay; 35 tons were dropped on thesetargets. Eighteen tons were released during two attacks on Toungoo airfield,where several fires were started in the dispersal areas. Jetties and the railway station at Monywa and rail tracks at Maymyo were bombed and hit.Escorted Japanese bombers attempted four raids on Maungdaw (58 miles .W. of Akyab); an ammunition dump and stores were hit in the first attack,but the other raid;s were dispersed by fighters before any damage was done.The landing-ground at Dohazari (21 miles S.E. of Chittagong) was renderedtemporarily unserviceable by unexploded bombs after a raid by escorted enemy bombers, in which buildings were set on fire and six aircraft damaged on theground. Fifteen enemy bombers, with an escort of 10 fighters, destroyed an ammunition dump at Ramu (110 miles N.W. of Akyab); Hurricanes andMohawks (P. 36) probably destroyed six of the raiders and damaged 10 others.Two formations of 25 bombers, with six fighters as escort, made ineffectiveattacks-on Cox&apos;s Bazar and shipping in the Naaf River. They were intercepted by 11 Hurricanes, which destroyed 10 of the bombers and damaged 10 morewithout loss. In addition, the destruction, of two and damage to two is claimed by anti-aircraft defences.Pacific Zone.New Guinea. . 144. Attacks were made on enemy positions, including those at Lae, Salamoaand Mubo, by Fortresses (B. 17), Liberators (B. 24), Bostons (A. 20) andBeauforts. An 8,000-ton ship was probably hit in Bogia harbour and hits or near misses are claimed on a cargo vessel at Wewak. A schooner was sunk nearUbili.Finschafen was bombed by a mixed force of Allied bombers; fires were started and damage was caused in the dock area. On the same day a Japaneseforce of four destroyers, first sighted off Kavieng, was attacked off Finschafenand subsequently retired northwards; one destroyer is believed to have been sunk.Further attacks on the harbour were made the following day. It is believed thatany attempt to deliver supplies failed.On the 28th about 40 enemy medium and dive-bombers, heavily escorted,bombed shipping and the waterfront at Oro Bay, 20 miles S.E. of Buna; a newwharf was severely damaged, a small ship was sunk and a 3,000-ton freighter seton fire. Lightnings (P. 38) and Kittyhawks (P. 40) intercepted the raiders and destroyed 11 fighters and two dive-bombers and probably destroyed eight fighters and four dive-bombers. One Kittyhawk (P. 40) was the only Allied casualty. Onthe two following nights attacks by six and three bombers respectively causedsome further damage to the docks and communications and a small fuel dump was destroyed.New Britain.. 45. Eight Liberators (B. 24) attacked Rabaul; fires resulted. Gasmata wasalso bombed.Solomon. Islands.46. Off Shortland Islands a low-level machine-gun attack was made by .S. aircraft on a Japanese destroyer, which was set on fire. Enemy positions at Faisi and Kahili were bombed.A amboina.47. Six Liberators (B.24) bombed Amboina; hits were made on the mainwharf and on ships in the harbour.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.48. There has been little effective bombing during the week. On the 29th, atBrighton, bombs seriously damaged seventeen houses, the borough market and aclinic; casualties were 15 killed, and 48 seriously injured.   At Hove a printing
works and four houses were demolished; casualties were nine killed and 17seriously injured. Bombs were also dropped on the 27th at Worthing and on the30th at Salcombe and Bolt Head aerodrome.On the night 28th/29th bombs were dropped at 29 places in East Anglia,doing little damage, and on the night 29th/30th there were a few trivial incidents in East Suffolk.Casualties.49.

The above table is an aggregation of the material in the employment tables of non-tankers and tankers in Statistical Digests E and F respectively. in combining the figures for non-tankers with those for tankers, certain slight differences have had to be brought into a common form. The figures for non-tankers relateto the last day of the month while those for tankers relate to the 15th of the month to February 1942 and to the last day of the month from March 1942.(1) (a) Tankers on Admiralty service include vessels importing oil fuel to the United Kingdom; in February 1943 these comprised 32 tankers of 255,000 gross tons.(6) Non-tankers allocated to the fighting services which are under repair are excluded from this column.   All tankers on Admiralty service are, however, included,(c) A part of the tonnage in these columns brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage (see note (3)).(2) These columns give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair. They do not,therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward voyages to the Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries other than United Kingdom and Eire-

This number is said to havebeen occasioned by the fact that shelters in the station (which photographs confirmwas severely damaged) were hit.Vegesack.Further photographs taken on the 23rd March show additional damage caused by&apos;the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 18th March. In the shipbuilding yards adirect hit on Slip No. 7 caused a ULboat under construction to capsize and pro-bably damaged another which was building on the East side of the slip.
