America and theUnited Kingdom, as soon as he had received fromthe Service Departments an estimate of whatstores could be made available in the middle east and Persia (including stores that could beprovided if later replacements were arranged),and after he had completed his enquiries as tothe position regarding on-carriage from theMiddle East to Turkey.2o     On the assumption that the Mediterranean will be open for regular convoys by August, I can find tonnage to begindeliveries to Turkey in that month from U. K. and north america,     To ensure arrival in Turkey via the Cape beforeAugust it would be necessary either to load during the next three weeks or to run a special convoy through theMediterranean.     Even if enough high priority cargo couldbe brought forward for loading&apos; in time, I could only make such emergency arrangements under a special directive andat the expense of other programmes.     There would be nopoint in straining our resources by sending round the Gapeadditional May or June ships to arrive no sooner thanvessels loaded in early July routed through theMediterranean,3.     In the meantime, stores which can be made availablein the Middle Bast, including captured material, and storesarriving there during April, May, June and July can be forwarded to Turkey.     An estimate of the quantity isgiven in Annex I.     The amount is substantial, but transport facilities to and within Turkey should be capable of handling this tonnage between now and the first arrivalsfrom U. K. or North America by the shorter route (see annex II).     I am prepared to undertake responsibilityi for delivery to Turkey although the provision of thenecessary shipping in the E. Mediterranean will not be easy.[ k*     The tonnage of stores required for Turkey from united Kingdom and North America for delivery by the endf u f. .       of -the year has not yet been exactly determined butml    &apos;      (including the cereals already covered by War cabinetloiSi. ,    v decision) it may amount to about 230,000 tons, plusfusion.) 8,000 vehicles of all sorts (see Annex III),     If the shipment were spread over the five months July to

November, the average would be about 1+6,000 tons, plus1,600 vehicles a month. In addition, there are about,000 tons a month from other sources.5*     My view therefore is that no additional shipping should be allocated over the next three months to loadsupplies from this country or n. America for Turkey, butthat as soon as advantage can be taken of theMediterranean, provision should be made for increasingsailings to the Middle East to meet our agreedcommitments to Turkey.6.     The economic use of tonnage requires the pooling of turkish with other Middle East cargo, and that whateverpriority is accorded to Turkish demands it is mostimportant that their programme should be co-ordinated, at every stage with the. military and civil programmes forthe Middle East as a whole.      For this purpose, all relevant information on the programmes should becommunicated to the C-inC., Middle East, and to theMiddle East Supply Centre who should be invited to makedue allowance for accepted Turkish requirements, both military and civil, when recommending the allotment ofshipping space proceeding to the Middle East from theUnited Kingdom and North America.7.     Apart entirely from the programme of aid to Turkeyoutlined above, there is the shipment of forces andequipment which would have to go to the assistance of theTurks if they became involved in the war.     I have notattempted to deal with this question here;    it is being discussed with the War Office by my Ministry.     Muchmore information will be required from the Middle Eastbefore a concrete plan can be worked out, and theprovision of shipping will naturally depend on conditions at the time when the emergency arises.8*     Finally, there is coal.     As a result of urgentrepresentations from the C-in-C., Middle East,4,000 tons of coal is being delivered in British-controlled shipping.      In addition to this, the Turkswill need 15-20,000 tons to be held in S* Turkey as areserve;    it is hoped that they will supply and transportthis on their own account.      Further, the C-in-C., Middle -Bast, has asked that a strategic reserve of some+0,000 tons be built up in the Middle East, to be drawn upon as required should Turkey become involved in thewar.     The creation of this reserve will be extremelydifficult, as we already find it very hard to meet our existing Middle East commitments.9*     I recommend therefore(i) that everything possible be done to assemble inthe Middle East and on-ship to Turkey themaximum quantity of military and civil suppliesover the next three months.! (ii) that additional ships should not be allocated inthe U.X. and N. America for loading goods for\ Turkey during this period, asthey would have togo via the Cape.(iii) that the first opportunity should be taken, afterthe Mediterranean is open for ocean-going traffic,to increase sailings from U.K. and North Americaserving the Middle East to an extent sufficientto ful?il accepted programmes for Turkey.MINISTRY OF WAR TRANSPORT.

GENERAL.These estimates are approximate, and depend, inter alia,on the general condition of the Turkish railways.   A heavyload at any one point will have the effect of diverting rolling stock from other lines.1 *    IS^HHS-lBii^MiTheoretical estimate by the War Office, which cannot berealised until there is an adequate supply of locomotives and rolling stock.2.    Port clearance capacity Icel and Iskanderun.The combined intake might   rise to 25,000 tons a month by June if certain promises regarding labour, etc.  are fulfilled by the Turks.3- Beirut Railway through Palestine,and Syria^,H.M. Ambassador estimates overland capacity into Turkeyat 27,000 tons per month, but doubts whether Turks can in facthandle this quantity by this route.    In practice, subject toneeds of the 9th Army and other priority traffic, the Beirutrailway can be used to fill any remaining capacity over theTaurus after routes 2 and 4 have made their full contribution.The figure has therefore been placed at 30,000,  although inview of Note 1 above this railway will not in practice be called -on to handle such&apos;a large amount.4* Bagdad^ Railway.This capacity will until June/July be required for thetransport of barley from Iraq.5* Ocean-going ships under British and American control canonly use the ports of Iceli and iskanderun and owing to slowdischarge, it is preferable to serve these ports with small ships.6,    gagternMMediterranean feeder service, ships.These will be used to keep icel and Iskanderun fully employed, in So far as these ports are not occupied with handlingocean tonnage.7, Railway capacity in North-West Turkey,This depends on availability and alternative employmentof locomotives and rolling stock,   A substantial proportionof shipments (e,g, cereals) to Izmir and Istanbul are, however,likely to be retained in these towns, and no serious problemof inland distribution is expected.8&apos;    Turkish shipping to and from Middle East.Based on the assumption of. the Turks allocating two ships to this service, capable of lifting 10,000 ton3 between them,with a month&apos;s turn-round, to Izmir (Smyrna) or other ports notaccessible to British tonnage.9* Ships,;handed over to the Turks.i Estimate is based on the assumption, of a month1s turn-round toizmir, etc, and on deadweight capacity of,ships in question.A&quot; April, only 9,000 tons can be lifted.NOTES TO ANNEX II.
