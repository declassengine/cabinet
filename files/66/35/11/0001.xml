H /    /   /     7  JoITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPriSECRET.W.P. (43) 111.March 19, 1943.WAR CABINET.TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (INTERIM DEVELOPMENT) RILL.Memorandum by the Minister of Town and Country Planning.1. I seek authority to introduce this Bill at an early date. The text of theBill and full notes on its Clauses have already been circulated as H.P.C. (43) 46.The Bill has been considered by the Legislation Committee and generally approved by them; but in discussion two points arose which it was felt the WarCabinet should have an opportunity of considering.2. Radical changes in the system of planning, in particular to deal with problems of reconstruction in bombed areas and with the control of land useoutside towns for the purpose of giving effect to policies for agriculture andindustrial location, have been promised by the Government and are stronglydemanded both by planning authorities and by many bodies interested in planning.This Bill makes no such radical changes, but is limited to strengthening thesystem of control of development within the period during which a planningscheme is in course of preparation..In discussion in the Legislation Committee it was suggested that the Billis exposed to challenge on the ground that it does not go far enough. But beforelegislation can be introduced to deal with these major problems, financial andadministrative questions of great complexity have to be settled; and whilesubstantial progress has been made in examining them I cannot hope until later in the year to introduce legislation even in regard to reconstruction areas: Inthe meantime there are certain powers which are urgently needed now. Thereare many areas, including many of the blitzed areas, in which at present there isno planning control at all and the present control, even where it operates, is inany case inadequate. Rights are being built up day by day which may seriously prejudice the carrying out of reconstruction work. The proposed Bill is, there-fore, a necessary step which can and should be taken immediately.The provisions of the Bill cover matters on which legislation has admittedlylong been neccessary. Such legislation has been recommended in the Scott andUthwatt Reports and has already been promised by the Government. Whileit is true that the provisions deal only with the control of interim development,so far as they go they represent a permanent reform in the law. The matterof immediate urgency is to prevent prejudice to reconstruction plans and forthis purpose the Bill is adequate.I submit that while the Bill may be criticised on the ground that it does not cover a wide enough ground, criticism would be even more justified if there were any further delay in legislating on these matters.3. Planning Authorities.The view is widely held, and was voiced in the Legislation Committee, thatcounty councils, and not county district councils, should be the planning authorities,and that the Bill, in leaving planning powers with the district councils, fails tomake an essential reform.  It is urged that the smaller authorities are parochial in[25183]ed for the War Cabinet.   March 1943.Copy No.
outlook and that the planning unit should be larger than a county district. I agree with this view so far as it relates to the necessity for larger planning units :and provisions are contained in the Bill to strengthen the power of the Ministerto combine councils, county borough councils and county councils for planning purposes.  My reasons for this course are : (i) To attempt to secure a radical change in the present distribution of planning powers between local authorities, in isolation from anygeneral review of the distribution of local government functions,would be likely to lead to a political storm which it would be unwise to provoke in connection with this Bill.(ii) The proper area for planning purposes often extends beyond the county;and the mere transfer of powers from county district councils to thecounty councils would not solve the problem. Moreover, counties and county boroughs usually need to be planned together. Accordinglyjoint committees would still be necessary even if the County councils the primary planning authority,nii) The county district councils are the housing authority, the sewerauthority, and often the water authority. All these matters are orfundamental importance to planning. It is, therefore, important that these authorities should be associated in planning. The jjointcommittee system is the only effective means of securing the necessaryassociation.(iv) The joint committee system for the preparation of planning schemes,with which in general the county councils are associated, has producedgood results.   It arose out of a spontaneous acknowledgment by local: .&apos; authorities that planning requirements go beyond district boundaries.The association in.common aims which the joint committee system has fostered has indeed been so successful that in certain instancesthe partnership has been continued on a more permanent footing for, the actual administration of the planning scheme,(v) The case particularly referred to in the Legislation Committee was theAdvisory Joint Committee for the Greater London Area.   that committee has proved to be unworkable.   What is proposed in theBill is, however, different, namely, joint committees charged with theactual duty of preparing schemes.   The London area admittedlypresents special problems.   I should hope to find a solution for them. under the provisions of the Bill.   It would, however, in my opinion, be wrong to condemn the joint committee system in the country generally on the ground of the London experience.(Initialled) W. S. M.March 19, 1943.
