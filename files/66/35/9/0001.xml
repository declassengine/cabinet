Much of the material in the note is based on secret information, but theinformation is so reliable and of such interest that I think it desirable to circulate the note for the confidential information of my colleagues.H. M.Home Office, March 13, 1943.THE COMMUNIST PAETY OF GEEAT BRITAIN.ON the 2nd September, 1939, the Communist Party announced its qualifiedsupport of the war, describing it as &quot; a war on two f ronts-against Hitler abroad and against the &apos; imperialist&apos; Chamberlain Government at home.&quot; Within afew days of the issue of this manifesto Harry Pollitt wrote in his pamphlet&quot; How to Win the War &quot;&quot; The Communist Party supports the war, believing! it to be a just war which should be supported by the whole working class and all friends of democracy in Britain.&quot; % NIts first change of line was announced! to the world in the Party&apos;s manifestoof the 7th October, 1939, in which it was stated : &quot;The continuance of this war is not in the interests of the people of britain, France or Germany. ....    The responsibility for the presentimperialist war lies equally on all the warring Powers.....The struggleof the British people against the Chamberlains and Churchills is the besthelp to the struggle of the Germans against,Hitler.&quot;This manifesto of the 7th October, 1939, characterised the war as an&quot;imperialist&quot; war, and introduced the Communist policy of &quot; revolutionarydefeatism,&quot; which remained the policy of the Party until the attack of Germanyupon Eussia in June 1941.The minutes of the meetings of the Central Committee of the CommunistParty from September 1939 to the early part of 1940 have come into the handsof the investigating authorities, and a study of them shows that this change of[25157]
policy was not decided without much debate and without fairly facing the conse-quences of the new line. The first indications that the change was necessarycame in references from Moscow to the imperialist nature of the war. these were followed by definite written instructions from Comintern headquarters,reading in part: &quot; The present war is an imperialist and unjust war, for which thebourgeoisie of all the belligerent States bear equal responsibility. In nocountry can the working class or the Communist Parties support the war..... The tactics of the Communist Parties in the belligerent countries inthis first stage of the war is to operate against the war, to unmask itsimperialist character.&quot;*Knowing that this instruction was on the way to them the Central Committeeof the Communist Party of Great Britain met on the 24th September. 1939, &quot; like a lot of rabbits in front of a snake,&quot; as Pollitt himself put it in his openingaddress. One of the Party leaders, D. F. Springhall, who had been in moscow in the early days of the war, returned in time to give the resumed meeting onthe 25th September an account of the views of the Communist International as stated by Dimitrov and Marty in conversation with him. These views wereconfirmed in the written instruction mentioned above. The discussion duringthis two-day meeting made it clear that P. P. Dutt, one of the Party&apos;s leadinginterpreters of Communist theory, was already prepared to accept &apos;&apos; revolutionarydefeatism &quot; with all its implications.The Central Committee met again on the 2nd October, 1939, by which timethe Comintern instruction had been received. Dutt took charge of the meeting and dealt firmly with the fallacy of the war on two fronts : &apos;&apos; You cannot fight imperialism by fighting the enemy imperialism in awar.&quot; he said. &quot;Certainly the enemy imperialism, whether&quot;it is Czarism,Kaiserism or what you like, is a foul imperialism, is an enemy of the working class/is a menace to the whole international working class. But if on thebasis of all these arguments you say &apos; Yes we fight imperialism.and we attack-this imperialism,&apos; you are not fighting imperialism, you are supporting your own imperialism. And that is why you cannot have a struggle on two fronts.It is a struggle on one front against our own imperialism.&quot;Military Defeat.Among the other speakers was Peter Kerrigan, who said : &apos;&apos; When we argue for the defeat of our own Government, as I under-stand it, this means the military defeat of the country, and this always means to me victory for German fascism.&quot;&apos;-     Dutfs reply was to restate the revolutionary defeatist policy : &quot; If you start fighting the enemy imperialists during a war, in practiceyou are supporting your own imperialists. That does not mean we are infavour of Hitler winning anything whatever. But if for that reason westart supporting the imperialist war of Chamberlain, then in practice we aresupporting imperialism.&quot;He made no attempt to deny Kerrigan&apos;s statement that the Communist Party&apos;policy was to work for the military defeat of the country.It was clear as the discussion progressed that almost all those present wereprepared to accept the Comintern&apos;s policy and its estimation of the war. . TheCentral Committee was not, however, left unaware of the dangers of revolutionarydefeatism.  J. P. Campbell said : - &quot; We started with the idea of supporting this war, but fighting for anew Government to carry it on. We are now asked to go over, oppose this war and use the situation to smash capitalism. We started to demanddemocracy for the colonies; we must now come away from that and activelysupport colonial insurrection. We started by saying that we had an interestin the defeat of the Nazis; we must now recognise that our prime interest is in the defeat of France and Great Britain, because that will furnish thesuitable conditions for a revolution in this country. We were to demanddemocracy in the army; we now have to change that and work for disruptionin the capitalist army.&quot;* For the fall text see Appendix A.
&quot; Don&apos;t let us,&quot; Campbell warned them, &quot; with a fascism which has notbeen militarily defeated or shaken, begin to see the perspectives of the worldrevolution as coming before fascism is defeated in the field, because, if wehave this perspective, we will arrive at a situation when, in our search forthe world revolution, we will get something far from being the world revolu-tion-a possible extension of fascism with regard to us in Western Europe.&quot;&quot; The defeat of France and Britain,&quot; he added, &quot; would be a mortal blow tothe British working-class movement.&quot;Pollitt said that it was clear that the fight against fascism had disappeared.&quot;In its place,&quot; he added, &quot;we nOw direct the main fire against Britishimperialism. May I say without offence that I don&apos;t envy the comrades who canso lightly in the space of a week, and sometimes in the space of a day, go from onepolitical conviction to another; that I don&apos;t believe that augurs well for a leader-ship that can command the confidence of the Party, the working class and themajority of the people.&quot; &quot; I am opposed to this thesis,&quot; Pollitt declared. &quot; Ibelieve that in the long run it will do this Party very grave harm.&quot;A resolution taken almost verbatim from the Comintern message was thenput to the meeting&apos;&apos; The Central Committee declares that the present war is an imperialistand unjust war. .... In no country can the working class or theCommunist Party support the war. .... The task of the Party in this first stage of the war is to operate against the war, to unmask its imperialistcharacter. .... The Central Committee further declares that it isnecessary to begin an offensive struggle against the treacherous policy of the leadership of the Labour Party.&quot;^The resolution was finally adopted by twenty-one votes to three, those opposingit being Harry Pollitt, J. P. Campbell and William Gallacher. At the endof the meeting Pollitt asked, on Gallacher&apos;s behalf, that his vote should be registered as in favour of the resolution. He explained, and this was certainlytrue, that Gallacher was led by his personal feelings to record his vote againstthe resolution though he did in fact accept it. Pollitt and Campbell maintained their opposition to the new policy until the middle of November 1939, when theysent in to the Central Committee letters of recantation. Copies of these lettersare given in Appendix C and Appendix D and are good examples of the workingof Communist Party discipline. -Encouragement of Strikes.Discussion at subsequent meetings of the -Central Committee showed that one part of the Communist programme of opposition to British imperialism was tohinder war production by strikes. Springhall spoke of shifting the main weightof the Party work to the factories and particularly to. the war industries.J. P. Campbell, who had by this time been accepted back into the fold, said-&quot; We are enjoying exceptional liberties at the present moment. Wemust be careful how we advocate our policy in war-time. You can very soonmove into a situation where it would bring the hammer down on the paper,(i.e., the Daily Worker) if it openly advocates strikes. We must proceedto organise strikes and demonstrations without calling for them.&quot;Kerrigan presented a report on the Party&apos;s wages campaign to the central committee early in 1940. He stressed the importance of the Party&apos;s factory work&quot; because we are aiming to get strikes on this issue.&quot; Ben Bradley thought thatthey could counter the workers&apos; support of the war by developing the campaign onthe question of wages. Pollitt, fresh from his recantation and keen to lose thewar, had this contribution &quot; If we can show the worker that the more he pays into national savingsthe more he is showing the Government and employers how they can reducehis wages, he begins to think twice. &quot;This has been put in one of the;biggesttramway depots in Manchester, and has been able to stop the stampede: whereby certain sections of workers felt that while the lads at the front aremaking sacrifice, it is our job to make sacrifice too.&quot;Ted Bramley, of the London District, said that on the wages issue amongengineers &quot; we are getting strikes in fewer factories than we aimed at.&quot;* For the full text of this resolution see Appendix B. .[25157]. - b 2
The Party was well aware that it would suffer serious harm even among manyof its own members if it could be shown openly that it was fomenting/strikes asa matter of policy. It was, therefore, careful to exploit existing grievances inthe factories. One Party leader put the position clearly when he said that therewas not a factory in which there was no grievance, and there was not a grievancewhich could not be turned into a strike. As a result, it is possible to quote very many instances in which Communists took a leading part in pressing for strike action, but it cannot be said that the strikes themselves had no industrial basis.In many cases, however, it is clear.that, given goodwill, a settlement could havebeen reached without a stoppage. The Communist Party in some cases shelteredbehind its auxiliary, the Engineering and Allied Trades Shop Stewards national council, and its periodical The New Propellor. The September 1940 issue ofthis paper carried the following quotation in a column headed &quot; QuestionsAnswered.&quot; : * :  -* -&apos;-&apos;*;-!&quot; Are strikes illegal? &quot;&quot; The new regulations banning strikes represent one of the mostflagrant attacks.on the rights of the workers.&quot;&apos;&apos; The Arbitration Boards, which are to settle strikes, if other negotia-tions fail, are heavily weighted against the workers and cannot be expectedto decide in the workers&apos; favour.&quot;&quot; In the last war militant action led by the Shop Stewards move-ment .... was responsible for the maintenance of workers&apos; rights. the extended holiday of the de Havilland. workers shows how militant action can secure concessions.&quot;The&apos; encouragement of &quot;extended holidays,&quot; which was simply anothername for strikes, was a frequent item in, the New Propellor. It is also known/that, at least in one case, strike literature, was prepared and duplicated in the offices and on the machines of the Engineering and Allied Trades shop stewards National Council.While the New Propellor was fomenting industrial unrest, the daily worker was persistently attempting to obstruct the prosecution of the war. &apos; Itis unnecessary to enter into details in this paper as the case against the daily worker was fully set out in W.P. (40) 482 of the 23rd December, 1940, beforetihe Daily Worker was suppressed. It is, however, interesting to. note thatGeorge Crane, a worker in one our greatest war factories, said at a meeting ofthe Central Committee of the Communist Party : &apos; ,&quot; We do not seem to be carrying on through our Party organisation the same kind of anti-Fascist propaganda. I put it this way. I do not feel personally the same hatred of the Hitler regime as I did in August andprior to that.&quot;German Attack on U.S.S.R.The attack by Germany upon the Soviet Union on the 22nd June, 1941,took the Communist Party leaders by surprise. The Political Bureau methurriedly and issued a statement which read in part: &quot; This attack is the sequel of the secret movements which have been taking place behind the curtain of the Hess Mission.....We can have no confidence in the present Government, dominated by Tory friends of Fascismand coalition Labour leaders, who have already shown their stand by theirconsistent anti-Soviet slander campaigns.&quot;When D. F. Springhall, the National Organiser, was asked in the lateafternoon of the 22nd June whether it would not have been better to await the Prime Minister&apos;s speech before publishing this statement, he replied : &quot;Wecan make up our minds without waiting to listen to that enemy of the workers.&quot;A further statement on the 23rd June said that the Prime Minister in his broad-cast offered only half measures. Technical and economic aid did not amount:tp immediate consultation for full collaboration in relation to the war arid thepeace.On the 26th June, 1941, Gallacher. met, representatives of the press and said :- &apos;&apos; The question to-day was collaboration between Britain and the soviet union in the interests of the people of this country and all other countries aswell as the people of the Soviet Union, and the Party would support theGovernment in any steps to this end.&quot;
Commenting on this in private conversation, R. P. Dutt said that the first thingwas to get the war carried through; the relative urgency of the different partsof the Party&apos;s programme varied at different stages.On the 4th July, 1941, the Central Committee issued yet another manifestoin which it said : -&quot; The Communist Party in this grave crisis in which the fate of thewhole of progressive mankind is at stake will work, fight and mobilise towin every citizen for the victory over fascism.&quot;On the following day,, however, an article written by R. P. Dutt appeared in world News and Views, in which the Government&apos;s policy is described as one of&quot; temporary collaboration &quot; : &quot;We can place no confidence,&quot; he said, &quot;in these reactionary ruling-; . class forces, who have for years shown their friendship for fascism and theirhatred of the Soviet Union; who only a little over a year ago were organisingr.   interventionist war and expeditionary forces against the Soviet Union; whoJ    still&apos;protect Hitler&apos;s emissary for the anti-Soviet campaign, Rudolf Hess.&quot;The confusion, in the minds of the Communist Party leaders was so great atthis time that one of them, speaking at a closed Party meeting, went so far as tosay that two Wars were now being waged : the fascist war against the SocialistFatherland and the imperialist war between the German and British imperialists.The situation was not finally clarified until Harry Pollitt sent a letter dated the8th July, 1941, to all Branches, in which he stated :- &quot;We. are fighting for the establishment of a united national front of all those who are for Hitler&apos;s defeat.&quot;&apos;&apos; In the light of this our attitude to the Churchill Government is plainand clear.&quot;&quot; When Comrade Stalin refers to Churchill&apos;s declaration of support tothe Soviet Union as &apos; an historic utterance,&apos; this puts the question so clearlyas to leave no room for doubt as to what our attitude towards this Governmentshould, be. Our fight is not directed against the Churchill Government, but those who are the secret friends of Hitler. VSince the attack upon Russia, the Communist Party&apos;s first aim has been tocontribute everything in its power to the defence of the Soviet Union. inspired by the continuing distrust of the motives of the Government of this country, it.believes that the interests of the Soviet Union can best be served by organisingpublic opinion in a way which will force the hand of the Government. Thisis well illustrated by the following extract from a Political Bureau circularissued in July 1942 : &quot; On every major issue that has arisen during the course of this war,, ithas been the mass pressure that has always compelled the Government to takeforms of action that were in accordance with the best interests of victory over fascism. . . . ,&quot; There can be no second front without a great mass movement being organised. There can be no such mass movement without the CommunistParty organising and heading it.&quot;Revolutionary Aims.In his comment on Gallacher&apos;s press statement in June 1941, Dutt spoke ofthe relative urgency of different parts of the Party&apos;s programme. It is clear fromevidence in the possession of the investigating authorities that the immediateurgency of the salvation of the Soviet Union has not changed the long-termrevolutionary aims of the Communist Party. A series of instructional classes,described in the Party jargon as &quot; cadres classes,&quot; have been held in various partsof the country to train new candidates for positions of trust. The Party comradein charge of these classes said in his introductory remarks : &apos;&apos; You may wonder why we are holding these classes for you industrialleaders. I will tell you : in Russia before the revolution similar classes were held and this led to the ultimate success of the revolution. Without the classes that we are holding now our own revolution will be disorganised andfutile.&quot;That was said in the first half of 1942.
Speaking about the same time, one of the tutors, whose name is known tothe authorities, said : &quot; We are a revolutionary Party. At this stage of the struggle we donot express this in our propaganda, but we never for one moment lose sight of the object. I think you will agree that there is no separate stage where you cian suddenly stop propaganda and start revolution. You must buildup more factory groups and go on building them and influence the people as we are doing now.&quot; Let us consider the Army, not just as it is at present. We know thatwe have to win the war and destroy fascism. Some comrades suggested thatwe should start a mutiny. Actually these mutinies will have taken place bytJhe time power is in our hands, which may be in just over a week, as it wasin Russia. It is better for the workers that they take place under ourleadership. Let us take the last war, there was a tremendous unrest. Thisstarted over the question of demobilisation, and when the troops were being sent to Archangel, because they thought they were being put back into thewar again.   Do we try to take over the Army when demobilisation starts ? &quot;Answer: &quot; We form a people&apos;s Army.&quot;Tutor: &quot; Yes, and where shall we look for the people&apos;s Army? &quot;Answer: &quot; Our comrades in the Army.&quot;Tutor: &apos;&apos; What about the officers ?   Do we shoot all or not ? &apos;&apos;Answer: &quot; Shoot most of them.&quot;Tutor: &quot;We should not kill all the officers; there are a number of officerssympathetic with our cause and could be won over to loyal support of the newworkers&apos; state.&quot;Another tutor, speaking about -a month later, said : Do you not see that force has got to be under the control of theworkers? We will have the key points, the factories, and the railways andthe docks and everything else. The taking of power will be carried throughby armed workers. Help will come from our comrades in the Army. Theywill disintegrate the Army. They can shoot officers. They can do everythingthey possibly can to break Up the power of the capitalist army.&quot;Yet another tutor said : &quot; You have got to get rid of the police. I do not want to advocatebloodshed, but it will be necessary. You arm the people, develop theRed Army and you seize the army and the capitalist weapons. You attack the leadership and disarm them, put them where you want them, under theground if necessary; but all we ask is to get control.&quot;These quotations are given to show that the Communist Party in this countrybelieves that a revolutionary situation may develop in the comparatively nearfuture, and has taken steps to see that its leaders are in a position to takeadvantage of it, if it should occur. It is not suggested that every member of theCommunist Party is aware of the Party&apos;s revolutionary programme, but the Partyitself believes that its leaders, properly instructed, will be able to carry the rank and file with them far down the road to revolution.
Short Thesis sent by the Communist International to C.P.G.B.,September 1939.THE present war is an imperialist and unjust war for which the bourgeoisieof all the belligerent States bear equal responsibility. In no country can theworking class or the Communist Parties support the war. The bourgeoisie is notconducting war against fascism as Chamberlain and the leaders of the LabourParty pretend. War is carried on between two groups of imperialist countries for world domination. The international working class may under no conditionsdefend Fascist Poland, which has refused the aid of the Soviet Union andrepressed other nationalities. The division of States into fascist and democraticStates has now lost its former sense. From this point of view the tactics must be changed. The tactics of the Communist Parties in the belligerent countries inthis first stage of the war is to operate against the war, to unmask its imperialistcharacter. The Communist Parties have fought against the supporters of Munichbecause these have prevented a real anti-fascist front with the participation of:the Soviet Union in order to be able to carry on a robber war. The war hasfundamentally changed the situation. Where Communist Parties have repre-sentatives in Parliament these must vote against the war credits. It must bemade clear to the masses that war will bring them nothing but new troubles andmisery. In the neutral States we must unmask the Governments which maintainthe neutrality of their own countries but support the war of other countries and operate on their profits, as, for example, the Government of the United states has done with regard to the war between Japan and China, The CommunistParties have to take on everywhere the offensive struggle against the treacherouspolicy of Social Democracy. The Communist Parties which acted, contrary tothese tactics must now immediately correct their policy.APPENDIX B.Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party ofGreat Britain passed on October 3, 1939.THE Central Committee declares that the present war is an imperialist andunjust war for which the bourgeoisie of all the belligerent States bear equalresponsibility. In no country can the working class or the Communist Partysupport the war. The bourgeoisie is not conducting war against fascism asChamberlain and the leaders of the Labour Party pretend. War is carried onbetween two groups of capitalist countries for world domination. The inter-national working class can under no conditions defend Fascist Poland, which has;refused the aid of the Soviet Union and oppressed other nationalities. the division of States into Fascist and &quot; democratic &quot; States has now lost its formersense. From this point of view the Central Committee declares that the tactics ofthe Communist Party must be changed. The task of the Party in this first stage ofthe war is to operate against the war, to unmask its imperialist character. The&apos;Communist Party has fought against the supporters of Munich because these have prevented a real anti-Fascist front with the participation of the Soviet Union in&quot;order to be able to carry on a robber war. The war has fundamentally changed the situation. The Central Committee instructs its representative in Parliamentto vote against the war credits. It must be made clear to the masses that war will bring them nothing but new troubles and misery. The Central Committee furtherdeclares that it is necessary to begin an offensive struggle against the treacherouspolicy of the leadership of the Labour Party.APPENDIX C.To the Central Committee.Dear Comrades, November 18, 1939.AS the responsible leader of our Party in the period immediately before theoutbreak of the present imperialist war, it was my special duty to have givenmore than ordinary consideration to the problems that were presented to us bythe failure of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, and the subsequent conclusion of the.Soviet-German Pact of Non-Aggression.This became more than necessary as the events in the latter days of Augustbegan to unfold themselves, when British Imperialism began to take on a moreaggressive attitude towards Germany that was in. such marked contrast toeverything that had characterised their policy since Hitler came to power in 1933.
The principal reasons why I did not take up promptly and decisively the newquestions of policy that the new situation placed before us was basically of athreefold character :- (1) My doubts about our traditional policy in an imperialist war in which one of the belligerent Powers was German fascism.(2) My hatred of fascism had developed by five years&apos; intensive anti-fascistpropaganda, which led to a position where I did not see in time the true role of British imperialism, and saw only German fascism asthe main enemy of the British working-class movement.(3) The influence of the fascist war of invasion, on Republican Spain alsoaffected my outlook because of the strong personal feelings which hadbeen aroused by what I had witnessed in Spain, and the responsibilityI felt I had in regard to the sacrifice made by the British battalion of the International Brigade.After the most serious consideration of the whole situation, I unreservedlyaccept the policy of the Communist Party and the Communist International, andpledge myself to support it, in explaining, popularising and helping to carry itforward to victory.I recognise that my action in resisting the carrying out of the line of theCommunist Party and the Communist International represented an impermissibleinfraction of our Party discipline, and played into the hands of the class enemy,and especially into the hands of the reactionary labour leaders, who saw in myattitude the justification of their own policy of supporting the ChamberlainGovernment.I request the Central Committee to accept this declaration, and to give me the facilities to prove in deeds that I know how to take my place in the frontranks,of our Party in fighting to win the masses for support of the policy of theCommunist Party of Great Britain and the Communist International.Yours fraternally,&quot; . (Signed) HARRY POLLIT.APPENDIX D.Declaration of Comrade J. R. Campbell.&quot; Having given careful consideration to the position since the last meeting ofthe Central Committee, I now completely accept the fact that the Manifesto ofthe 2nd September gave an entirely incorrect estimation of the position and misledthe Party as to the character of its tasks in this war.&quot;I declare my support for the resolution of the Central Committee and theManifestoes on Peace and on the character of the war published after the last meeting of the Central Committee.&quot; I am in full agreement with the article of Comrade Dimitrov as published in the Daily Worker of the 4th November.&quot; With regard to the mistakes which I committed, the central mistakes were,in my opinion, as follows : &quot; (1) The policy of the fight on two fronts, which would have been a correctpolicy (in peace or in war) with regard to an imperialist Governmentin alliance with the Soviet Union, was persisted in with regard to awar between two imperialist Governments.&quot; (2) It Was persisted in because I narrowed the perspective in such a way asto concentrate on German fascism as the main enemy of the Britishworking class and failed to see that the way forward for the British,no less than for the German, workers lay in a struggle with the maini&apos; enemy, i.e., their own imperialists. I thus slipped into a position ofnational defence in an imperialist War, involving Objectively support for our own Imperialism,,&quot; The attitude to the peace proposals followed from this mistakenperspective.&quot; Undoubtedly, the stubborn defence of this wrong position did harm to theParty, when it had to make a sharp turn in a most difficult situation, and I must accept responsibility for resisting what has been proved to be the correct line.&quot;Yours fraternally,(Signed) ,1. R. CAMPBELL.
