In the Chantiers et Ateliers die St. Nazaire (Penhouet)and Bassin de Penhouet the submarine stores shed, the pipe and tube works,the munitions store, several other warehouses and sheds, including an area of2-1 acres have been destroyed or severely damaged by fire or H.E. In the Chantierset Ateliers de la Loire, the heavy sheet metal shop and aero oil factory and thegirder steelwork shop have been wholly or partially destroyed. Public utilitiesaffected include the gasworks and gas or water mains, and several barrackbuildings have been destroyed. In the centre of the town an area of 140 acres of residential property has been devastated, and it is estimated that, includingsmall areas in other parts of the town, 170-200 acres of residential and commercialproperty have been destroyed. About 50 per cent, of the buildings in the oldtown have now been destroyed.Berlin (1st/2nd March).Night photographs confirmed crews&apos; reports that a very fine concentrationhad been achieved, and; suggested that the main weight of the attack had fallen in the Wilmersdorf area. This is a closely built-up zone containing workers&apos;houses and important factories about 2 miles from the centre of the city.Full day cover has not yet been obtained. Extensive damage has, however,been caused throughout the West, South-West and Southern Areas of the city.Numerous buildings and blocks of houses have been destroyed in the areas ofWilmersdorf, Schoeneberg, Steglitz and Chariottenberg. Many buildings in thecity centre (including some near Unter den Linden) have also been destroyed anda number of industrial undertakings have been hit.The list of factories and-buildings destroyed and damaged includes :  Tempelhof Marshalling Yard greater part of the large railway work-shops gutted and still burning.      -Klockner-Humbolt Deutz A.G. (Magirus Works), Tempelhof (RepairWorkshops).Vereinigte Fahrzeugwerke A.G., Tempelhof.Tempelhof, Reichpost u. Telegraph Zeugamt.Blaupunkt Werke G.m.b.H. (Wireless apparatus, &amp;c), Wilmersdorf.Askania Werke A.G. (Optical and precision instruments, &amp;c).Mariendorf Ges  fur Elektrische Unternehmungen L. Loewe  A.G.(Machine tools, electrical apparatus,; &amp;c).West Harbour, Charlottenburg-4 warehouses and. a number of other buildings on quayside gutted.St. Hedwig Church (off Unter den Linden). .Technische Hochschule, Charlottenburg.Deutschland Halle, Charlottenburg.Unidentified factory, buildings in Wilmersdorf, Lankwitz, Tempelhof,Charlottenburg and Stralau.//amburg (3rd/4th March).A force of. 417 aircraft&apos; was despatched. Night photographs confirmed agood concentration of attack, but showed that the weight of it had fallen On asmall town some miles further clown the Elbe. This error was due to insufficientexperience with the improved navigational aids; the experience gained on thisraid will be applied to future operations.
Essen (5th/.6th and 12th/13th March).Photographs (Prints 4 and 5) show that an area of 450 acres, was devastatedby the first attack, made by 422 aircraft. Most of the damage was done to factories and workers&apos; homes, but public utility and: transport services also suffered. ;      -;- -       .-.:       .In Krupps (the aiming point) 53 separate shops including rolling mills,machine-shops, repair-shops and boiler-houses were:hit; 13 main buildings were destroyed or severely damaged. An area of the works buildings of over 130,000square yards was severely damaged and 11  acres of workers&apos; houses burnt outwithin the works alone.The workshops and stockyards of Goldschmitt A.G. (metal smelters) andMaschinenbau A.G. Union (engineering works) were largely destroyed; two-thirds of the Municipal Tram Depot were wrecked and 3^ acres at the GasWorks devastated. Two trains were burnt out at the Main Station and otherrolling-stock destroyed in the marshalling yard. The Town Hall, Town CouncilOffices and Exchange were destroyed. In the centre of the town no fewer than700 buildings were gutted by fire or demolished by H.E., while a rough countin other parts of Essen shows that over 2,000 houses were destroyed or severely damaged. From past experience this means that an even greater number are more or less uninhabitable. -. Another very heavy attack was launched on 12th/13th March. detailed assessment is not complete, but first reports indicated that an outstanding successwas again achieved. Day photographs, which showed large fires still burning,confirmed that further heavy damage had been done to Krupps. ; 48 further shops and administrative buildings were affected, of which 12 were main buildingswhere half the area was destroyed or severely damaged. Over 190,000 square yards of Krupps buildings were destroyed or severely damaged in this raid,compared.with 130,000 in the previous one.Nuremberg (8th/9th March).335 aircraft attacked on the 8th/9th March. The German version of what happened is as follows :  -&quot; The British who claim to be civilised people, acted like barbarianswhen they deliberately attacked and destroyed beautiful mediaeval buildings in the centre of Nuremberg. . . . . It is obvious that the British airmendeliberately dropped their bombs on the historic monuments and architecturallandmarks of the ancient city.&quot;Photographs (Print No. 6) taken on the day after the attack show that the damage done was mainiy to industrial buildings and that a large number ofimportant factories are involved. Great damage has also been done to railwayproperty.The following are among the more important casualties :--M.A.N. Engineering Works (Submarine Diesels).Siemens Schuckert Electrical Works.Alumnium-Werke.Geschaft fur Elektro-Metallurgie (Chemical Works).Felten Guillaume Electrical Engineering Works.Bayerisches Hammerwerk Engineering Works.sud-Deutsche Metall, Engineering Works.Steinmesse und Stolberg, Engineering Works.Railway marshalling yard, repair shops and railway administrationbuilding.Most of these are nowhere near the centre of the City.Munich (9th/ 10th March).Very heavy damage was done in the centre of the city, and some well-knownbuildings, including the Alte Pinakothek, were hit. German propaganda alwaysreacts powerfully to attacks on the home town of the Nazi movement, and theresults of this raid have produced hysterical outbursts : &quot; The British night raidon!Tuesday was not directed against.any military or war&apos;important objectives;but exclusively against monuments of art and the civilian1 population of the city.&quot;.[25211] &apos; B   9&apos;-    ! ,
The following not mentioned by the Germans are shown by photographs tohave been damaged, in some cases severely :  - .        J. Rathgeber A.G. Waggon Works.Bayerische Motoren A.G.Motorenwerke Mannheim.Munchen/Oberweisenfeld A/D.The Gity gasworks (where a gasometer exploded).:  Two barracks and two army equipment stores.   -The new Nazi Brown House appears to have been damaged by blast, and several outbuildings were burnt out.Stuttgart (llth/12th March).314 aircraft attacked Stuttgart on 11th/12th March. This target, whichhas frequently escaped in the past, has again been lucky. A very poor concentra-tion was achieved, and it is unlikely that any substantial damage has yet been effected there.K naben (3rd March.)The attack on Knaben, from which it is estimated that Germany has been receiving three-quarters of its supplies of Molybdenum (the balance came from french Morocco), appears to have been highly successful. It is stated on goodauthority that damage was so complete that production will cease entirely for atleast ten months.This damage to Germany&apos;s war potential was achieved for the loss of one aircraft.Information regarding Previous Raids.Cologne.Regent photographs show many items of damage not previously reported,particularly business and residential areas on the west bank and in the southpart of the city and the southern suburbs. A number of industrial concernshave been heavily hit, including : ,   Poehlig,  A.  G.  (Machinery manufacturers) *1\ acres of buildingsgutted.Siegel &amp; Co. (Chemicals) 1,800 square yards of multi-bay building,5 sheds and 3 2-bay buildings destroyed.matter Karl (Rubber Works) 3 large buildings destroyed.Ernst  Bading   (Transport  Vehicle   Construction   Works) 3   large buildings destroyed.Koeln Nippes Railway Yard Large trans-shipment shed destroyed.Among other works and public utilities affected are:  Atlantic Rubber Works.Westdeutsche Waggon Werke.Bonner Goods Yard.Bayenthai Tramway Depot.Wilhelmshaven.Much new damage (some of which is due to the United States A.A.F. attackon the 26th February) is now visible both in the centre of the town and in the docks area. In the Strombau Hafen several buildings belonging to the HarbourWorks Department have been damaged; two blocks of the S/M crews&apos; barrackshave been partly destroyed and others damaged, and two sheds to the west havebeen damaged. A direct hit on the south quay has damaged a 240-ft. oil barge,which is seen to be awash amidships. -The central building in the Fort Mariensiel Mine Depot has been destroyedby fire and four unidentified factories have been damaged in Middelsfahr andMetz.In the main railway station the central bay of the goods station has been demolished and the tracks have been destroyed at one point. Trades and rolling-stock have also been damaged in the Strombau Hafen and in the Kanal KohlenHafen.Eleven barrack huts in the Middelsfahr Barracks have been destroyed and six more seriously damaged, and in the Ebkeriege Barracks two blocks aredamaged and three huts demolished.
Milan.The number of incidents in the town is considerable, although the centres and the areas east and west of the centre are comparatively free from damage.The most severe damage is in the neighbourhood of the Porto Romana goods station in the south-east and the Scalo Farina Goods Yards in the north-west.Fifty-one factories have suffered varying degrees of damage; railway communi-cations have been affected in at least two places and a wagon repair shop andsheds in the goods yards seriously damaged. Damage to residential and businessproperty is less conspicuous, but 35 separate incidents of damage can .be seen.Ground sources report that the Bersagliere Barracks were hit and200 service personnel killed and 300 wounded. In the Brown Boveri Works(manufacturers of transformers and electric motors) the assembly shed was completely destroyed together with its entire contents. The roof of the largeconstruction shed collapsed but damage to the machine tools was light. Work was stopped completely and, of the 700 men normally employed, 400 were transferredto the other branches and the remainder employed in clearing-up work.A ulnoye.Photographs taken on the 4th March during the attack on the locomotiverepair shops and engine sheds and the steel tube factory show at least 12: burstson the Steel tube factory and at least four on the engine sheds.Le Mans.Photographs taken on the 4th March during the attack on the marshalling yards show that bombs have fallen on workshops situated between the round-houses, on a long shed and on timber stacks East of the reception sidings andon tracks in the sidings and North of the roundhouses.Locomotive Attacks.Engineers of the French State Railways have stated that all steam locomotivesin the district of Pau near the Spanish Frontier have been sent north to replacelocomotives damaged by the Royal Air Force, and that, owing to the damage caused at Tours (St. Pierre cles Corps), repair to steam locomotives in S. W. france has been considerably hampered.It is reported that during one week in November 1942 seven engines were destroyed on the railway tracks by air attack in the Havre area alone.Rennes (February 26th).A photograph showing damage caused during the daylight raid on Renneson the 26th February is attached (Print No. 7).&quot;A.
