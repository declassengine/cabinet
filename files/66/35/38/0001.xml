THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   A^il 1943.MOST SECRET. . Copy No.W.P. (43) 138.April 12, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.MATERIAL STOCKS AND PRODUCTION PROGRAMMES.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.DURING the winter our stocks of materials have been running down fast.In- the four months November, December, January and February, our netconsumption of imported raw materials was 4-1 million tons, of which only -4 million tons, or less than 60 per cent., was met by imports, more than 40 percent, being drawn out of stocks. This de-stocking is still continuing, though at a somewhat lower rate, and the outlook for imports does not encourage the hopethat the position will right itself without further efforts on our part.2. By the end of March our stocks of food and raw materials were belowthe level which the Lord Presidents Committee decided upon as the permissibleminimum. The chart in the Annex shows, the movement of stocks of rawmaterials alone since the beginning of 1941. On the 31st March they were only ^ million tons above the distributional minimum that is, the level below whichlack of material may be expected to cause interruptions to regular production(see the Annex for further details of the origin of these levels). Our declared policy for 1943 is so to conduct our affairs that, if the war situation requires,we should be able later in the yeax-to direct additional ships to military purposes without disastrous results on the industrial front. This requires thatwe maintain stocks at the level held on the 31st December. Our actual achieye-ment diverges so far from this policy of &quot; elbow room &quot; that we are in dangerof having to live from hand to mouth.3. To recover the ground we have lost and restore the end-December stocklevel would require either a very drastic cutting of consumption or a sharperincrease in imports than can be expected until the amount of available shipping and the supply of escort vessels improves. But at all costs we must stop thedecline. This means that from now onwards we should limit our consumption of imported material so far as possible to what actually comes in.4. The Minister of War Transport can only make tentative estimates ofimports for the rest of the year. There are so many uncertainties that it isimpossible to do more than give a range *of probability. The easy course wouldbe to assume a reasonably optimistic figure of probable imports, to planconsumption on this basis and to allow any deficit to fall on stocks. With thepresent trend of stocks we cannot take this risk. I propose, therefore, to make available for consumption during the rest of the year an amount of importedraw material corresponding to a total import near the lower end of the range of probability. The figure I propose to take for this purpose is 9 million tonsof imported raw materials for the nine months, or an average of 3 million tonsa quarter. This compares with actual consumption of 3-4 million tons of imported material per quarter in the last three quarters of 1942 and a substantially higher figure needed to carry out the production programmesoriginally planned for 1943..   If actual imports turn out to be higher than this[25258]     . . b
9 million tons, the excess can be used either to replace stocks or for new andunforeseen demands which are very likely to arise in the crisis of the war.But we must not now consume raw material under present deparmental programmes on a more generous scale than I have proposed. To do so wouldmean not only that we should give up hope of regaining elasticity in the use ofour ships, but if our import experience were unf avourable--we should riskdislocating production for lack of material.5. In the particular case of steel, an allocation of 5-7 million tons hasalready been made for the first half-year. Although home production of steel iswell maintained, stocks have fallen sharply in the fast six months. The case forconservation is at least as pressing as for other materials. I propose, therefore,that departmental allocations for the second half-year shall be limited, to5-4 million tons subject to the arrangement mentioned in paragraph 9. Thismeans consumption at the rate of 2-7 millions a quarter as compared with a littleover 3 millions in the first quarter of 1943. Since there are important uses ofsteel which must inevitably increase, it will be clear to my colleagues that thisreduced allocation will have severe implications in those uses where consumptionis curtailed.6. Whether this further cut will force production below the requirementsof the Services depends very largely upon the adjustments that can be made inthe Ministry of Supply programme. There are two reasons for thinking that theMinistry of Supply can make a contribution to the present problem without serious military repercussions. The first is that the War Office is at presentgiving the Ministry revised requirements which take account of the Casablancadecisions and of recent war experience. They are expected to be lower than the interim estimates on which the Ministry has been replanning its production in thelast two.months.7. , The second is that in many cases the production programmes^ as revised in the first three months, are such that total supplies to the end of 1944 will bemore than are called for by the interim Service requirements, some of which arenow about to be further reduced. Sometimes, indeed, the margin is substantial.The reasons that have actuated the Ministry in leaving a margin of productionabove requirements include the possibility of upward changes in the requirements;the need of some marginal capacity for producing new types; the wish of the WarOffice that requirements of forces based on the United Kingdom shall be met from home production; and the need for retaining some measure of dispersal. But even with these limitations the cuts made by the Ministry of Supply should carry outthe instruction of the War Cabinet that the number of workpeople employed bythe Ministry should be reduced by 120,000 by December 1943, and have gone far toreduce its prospective steel consumption in the first half of 1943 to the tonnageallotted to it by the Materials Committee. .8. The considerations that have guided the action of the Ministry of Supplyhave, substance; but the need for preventing any further fall in stocks is nowparamount. In particular, it is better to face the prospect of temporary and localunemployment rather than to use up stocks of materials in making.equipment thatis not needed. In order that the new revisions in Ministry of Supply programmes should be as. large and should come into effect as quickly as possible, I proposethat they should be worked out on the following principles :  (a) Every effort should be made to release as large a proportion as possible of the 120,Q00 workpeople by the middle instead of by the end of 1943,I eyenjitjthe,risk,of some unemployment, and the full reduction should/ be made by the end of September. &quot;The total releases for the year,- which should not be limited to 120,000, will be determined by the finalprogramme revisions. .(6) The new production plans should be such that the proposed supply of the major items of munitions from all sources (stocks plus production athome and overseas) to the end of 1944 should not exceed service\ i requirements to the same date by more than, say, 5 per cent.  The only&apos;! exceptions to this rule should be for the sake of maintaining in Greatx I Britain a minimum of production for strategic purposes and this, I&apos; suggest, need only cover maintenance rates for forces based on theUnited Kingdom.9. I realise that the Ministry of Supply, which consumes over 40 per cent,of our total steel, will encounter special difficulties in making reductions in theirplanned production of the dimensions which they have now to face and that this
makes close budgeting exceptionally difficult. I have therefore agreed that inorder to meet these special conditions the chairman of the Materials Committeewill be prepared, if necessary, to assign steel to the Ministry of Supply in excessof the quantity allocated in accordance with paragraph 5 the amount of this additional allotment being limited to 300,000 tons in the nine months endingDecember 1943. The Minister of Supply, who fully accepts the need of speedingup the changes in production, will limit his requests for help from this reserve to the lowest possible figure.10. I cannot yet say whether the application of these principles will resultin economies sufficient to balance the cuts in the rate of allocation of materials.If not, we shall have to face the necessity of postponing some Service require-ments. The matter will be again reviewed as soon as the revised War Officerequirements have been examined by the Ministry of Supply and revisedproduction rates agreed.11. The Minister of Supply agrees with the policy set out in this paper andconcurs in its proposals.&apos; O. L.Ministry of Production, S.W. 1,April 12, 1943.ANNEX.The attached chart shows the course of stocks of raw materials since january 1941. The origin of the stock levels marked on the chart is asfollows : (a) Distributional Minimum. The Shipping Committee in its First Report(S.C. (42) 20) gave, for certain important materials, figures of the level of stocksbelow which any further reduction would interfere with production anddistribution. The level for all imported raw materials corresponding to thesefigures has been estimated at 9 - 8 million tons.(b) Elbow Room Level. Policy has in recent months been based on the PrimeMinister&apos;s directive that the aim should be to maintain stocks at such a level as would permit a substantial diversion of shipping later in the year if it should then be desirable on strategic grounds. The Minister of Production has definedthis policy, in so far as it relates to raw materials, as meaning the maintenanceof stocks at the level of the end of 1942 (S.C. (43) 45). This gives an &quot; elbowroom &quot; level of 12-5 million tons.In June 1942 the Lord Presidents Committee ruled that it would not be safe to reduce stocks to the distributional minimum, and that the reduction, inthe period to the 30th June, 1943, should be limited to 4 - 0 million tons below theactual level at the end of 1941. This, however, related to food and raw materialstogether, and since the total has never been divided between the two categoriesit cannot be shown on the chart.[25258]
