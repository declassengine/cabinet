(43) 119.March 24, 1943.WAR CABINET.Mr. ROOSEVELT&apos;S PROPOSAL FOR A CONFERENCE ON FOOD.Note by the Secretary.THE attached telegrams have already been circulated, but have been printedtogether for convenience of reference.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES,Secretary.Offices of the War Cabinet,March 24, 1943.:  Mr. Eden to Viscount Halifax (Washington).(No. 275.)   - &quot; ;       -   &apos;My Lord, Foreign Office, March 10, 1943.The United States Charge d&apos;Affaires asked to see me this afternoon, whenhe brought me the attached official note from the United States Government.2. Having read this communication, I told Mr. Matthews that His Majesty5sGovernment would, of course, at once consider this proposal for a conference. Inprinciple, I felt sure that we would be ready to fall in with any arrangements ofthis kind. The only doubt I had, after the first reading of the proposal, was whether the date for a meeting, the 27th April, was not a little early. It seemedto me highly desirable that the first meeting of the United Nations should be a success, and, in my experience, it was difficult for conferences to have a fair chanceof success unless the ground had been fully prepared beforehand. I was not sure that our own exchanges could be described as having reached this point yet.3. Mr. Matthews replied that this was exactly what had occurred to him,i.e., that the date was a little early. I said that he could be sure, however, that wewere ready to give our full help in trying to make a success of the plans which theUnited States Government appeared to have in mind.I am, &amp;c.ANTHONY EDEN.Enclosure.Mr. Matthews to Mr. Eden.   -(Confidential.) 1, Grosvenor Sauare,Dear Mr. Eden, London, Idarch 10, 1943.I have been requested, by the Department of State, by direction of thePresident, immediately to inform you that the Government of the United Statesdesires to send an invitation, the text of which I enclose, to the Governments of allthe United Nations and of, those American republics which have broken offrelations with the Axis Powers and are collaborating with the United Nationsiq the conduct of the war.  My Government, before doing so, would like to have[25204] . b
the views and suggestions of the Governments of the United Kingdom, the Unionof Soviet Socialist Republics and China.My Government feels sure that the suggested initiative will meet with the favourable response of the British Government, and that the United States can count upon receiving its cordial co-operation in the efforts which must be under-taken to achieve the objectives sought. The United States Government, would,however, appreciate receiving, at the earliest convenient moment, whatever viewsor suggestions the British Government chooses to express.I have been directed to request that this matter be treated as entirely con-fidential until invitations can be sent to all the United Nations.Sincerely yours,H. FREEMAN MATTHEWS.Sub-enclosure.Text of Invitation from the United States Government enclosed with Letterfrom the American Charge d&apos;Affaires ad interim dated March 10, 1943.The Government of the United States believes that the time has arrived forthe United Nations and other nations associated with them in the present war to begin joint consideration of certain fundamental economic questions whichwill confront them and the world after the attainment of coriaplete militaryvictory. As a first step in this direction, the Government of the United Stateshereby invites the Government of blank to send a small number of appropriatetechnical.and expert representatives to a conference which it proposes to convokeat some suitable place in the United States on the 27th April for the purpose ofproviding an opportunity for an exchange of information and. views relatingto the following topics and for the purpose of exploring and seeking an agreement in principle as to the most practicable and desirable methods and means ofdealing with the problems indicated below : 1. Post-war plans and prospects of various countries for the production,import requirements and/or exportable surpluses of foodstuffs and other essentialagricultural products in the light of possibilities of progressively improving ineach country the levels of consumption within the framework of an expansion ofits general economic activity. It is understood that such consideration is entirelydivorced from the question of the provision of relief. i2. Possibilities of international agreements, arrangements and institutions:designed to promote efficient production, and to ensure for the world adequate&apos;Supplies of food and other essential agricultural products. Consideration wouldbe given to the attainment of equitable prices from the viewpoint of both the producers. and the consumers.3. Trade, financial and other arrangements necessary to enable the countries of the world to obtain the foodstuffs and other essential agricultural products which they need and to maintain adequate markets for their own surplusproduction.4. Possibilities of international co-ordination and stimulation of national policies for the improvement of nutrition and for the enhancement of consumption in general.(2)From Foreign Office to Washington, dated 15th March, 1943.(No. 1682.)Projected food conference.The Prime Minister has now agreed to: sign a letter to the United StatesCharge d&apos;Affaires of which the text is given in my immediately following1telegram.* .. &quot;&apos;&apos;2.

From Foreign Office to Washington, dated loth March, 1943.(No. 1683.) iFollowing is text referred to in my immediately preceding telegram* : Before he left London Mr. Eden,showed me your letter of 10th March.t I,shall be grateful if you will inform your Government that His Majesty&apos;s Govern^ment warmly welcome their initiative in calling a conference to consider questions connected with the consumption and production of food-stuffs and other essentialagricultural products.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government share the view of the United StatesGovernment that this is one of the important fields in which the United Nationsmust reach an agreed policy for promoting general prosperity after the war. HisMajesty&apos;s Government.will therefore be happy to participate in the spirit of themost cordial co-operation in such a conference..3, In accordance with the, invitation contained in your letter, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are carefully considering what positive suggestions they can offer to facilitate the work of the conference and to further the ,attainment of the objects which the United States -Government have in mind. They willcommunicate their suggestions to the United States&apos; Government at em early date.* No. 2. f Enclosure to No. 1. .. \ .   !    &apos; (4). :    -      ...&quot;   \From Foreign Office to Washington, dated 15th March, 1943.(No. 1684.)Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the longer of the two draft telegrams^ replying to Washington telegram No. 1021, t prepared before the Secretary of State left,t Not printed. &apos;-:* These two draft telegrams were never actually despatched,&apos; though they were taken to washington by the Foreign Secretary. &apos;The relevant extracts are as follows:- .2. It appears now that the following conversations are in any case contemplated in thefairly near future:  (fi) A Belief Conference of the United Nations (presumably in Washington). &apos;(b) Monetary discussions between the United&apos; Nations arising out of circulation of the stabilisation Fund document and the Clearing Union plan. ... .-(c) Food discussions unconnected with Relief-^-and apparently dealing with food, both fromthe producers&apos; and from the consumers&apos; angle, i.e., from the angle of primary products and nutrition respectively.   This Conference might - (we understand the President tohave said) be summoned in some remote place.: (d) international discussions on &quot; metals, oil or any other subjects that it seemed convenient to examine.&quot;   These would be subsequent to any discussions on food.  :3. In view of these very vague indications of American intentions, I should be glad if you would at once try to pull the situation together by speaking to Mr. Hull on the following lines:  (i) We should hope that the Americans would agree to the monetary talks and the foodtalks to which they are now committed forming part of a general programme, whichwould also include primary products; international investment and trade barriers.(ii) We for our jjart.have always believed that the most satisfactory way of making progress on all international economic matters would be to reach if possible preliminaryagreement between the United States and the United Kingdom.   Having achieved&apos;; ameasure of agreement; we opghttp take the Russians, and Chinese into our confidence,.....     and the next step should be&apos; talks with experts, of other&apos; United Nations.&apos;!.    (iii) If this procedure is followed arid a real effort made to make&apos; quick progress it will be&apos; possible to summon at an early date a United Nations economic conference, which&apos;  1 &apos; could deal with a number of questions which had already been&apos;thrashed out sufficiently,&apos;  : to show reasonable prospect of agreement being reached.   As part of the machineryfor such a conference we think it would be very useful to have a Steering Coranuttee,with representatives of the four Powers and a limited number of the. other Powers,- including the Dominions, the European Allies and the&apos;Latin Americans,, chosen fromthose countries most directly concerned and best able to contribute expert knowledge.Such a &apos; Committee could continue in being as a permanent nucleus &quot;for economic co-operation between the United Nations,(iv) While this procedure seems to us the best and to be in line with what the Americansseem, sometimes at any rate, to have contemplated, we should not wish any prolongedcontroversy about-procedure to delay effective discussions. Thus, if the United states administration have, alternative proposals we should be very ready to consider them,but we clearly want to avoid having a number of conferences discussing differentquestions in different places instead of working on a comprehensive programme to deal[25204] b 2
v have now been approved by the Ministers concerned as a basis for a generalconversation about the best method of making progress in post-war economic discussions.2. Meanwhile, as you know, we have received the text of the invitationwhich the United States Government desires to issue to a conference of expertson 27th April. The text of the reply by the Prime Minister accepting this invitation has been telegraphed to you.3. Before offering the views and suggestions for which the United StatesGovernment ask we feel we must enquire what relation the proposed conference is intended to bear to post-war economic discussions as a whole,   Is it intended -(a) that the conference should pass resolutions advocating, for example^.improved standards of nutrition, improved methods of agricultural production, and the reduction of agricultural protectionism, but atthe same time should call attention to the difficulties of giving effectto these resolutions, difficulties, the surmounting of which will involvethe finding of solutions for a number of related problems in the field of monetary arrangements, international investment, commoditycontrol and commercial policy. These, no doubt, will call for separatediscussion, or(b) to initiate talks on all these topics under the facade of discussing foodpolicy ?We should prefer (a).If the intention is (a), will the agenda include buffer schemes and regulationof output as affecting foodstuffs, but leave the discussion of similar problems as affecting raw materials for subsequent discussion ?4. In either event is it appreciated that much preparation of the groundbeforehand seems necessary if concrete results are to be obtained, and that upto the present it is only as regards international monetary questions that jointpreparatory work has been done? As regards the method of making progress with the more general economic discussions on the related problems referred toin paragraph 3 above, do the United States Administration agree generally inthe procedure and programme outlined in the longer draft referred to inparagraph 1 above ?5. Will not the occupied countries whose populations are threatened withstarvation regard it as essential that the question of immediate post-war reliefshould on no account be relegated to the background, and that a conference ofthe United Nations on immediate post-war relief should have been announcedbefore the conference on post-war food problems meets ? In this connexion see also my immediately following telegram.6. If the United States Government have begun to draft detailed agendaand any documents for submission to the conference, it would be of great value to His MajestyJs Government to be kept informed in confidence of what theyhave in mind. _(5)From Foreign Office to Washington, dated 15th March, 1943.(No. 1685.)Reference paragraph 5 of my immediately preceding telegram.*It is not clear to us whether&apos;the United States Government, in suggesting that proposed Pood Conference should be entirely divorced from provision of&quot; relief,&quot; are using term &quot; relief &quot; in a narrower sense than we do. Programmingof relief supplies inevitably involves whole problem of organising production,with subjects, all of which are inter-related. Some form of preliminary soundings isnecessary before international meetings are summoned, but it seems difficult to believethat as a general principle a convenient form of taking such soundings is to summonall the United Nations experts to Washington and then start a very large number of individual talks.(v) We are in any case relieved to learn from telegram 1021 that Mr. Welles believes that political security problems should be limited, at any rate in the first place, to theFour Great Powers. If the economic discussion should take place in the United States,we for our part would certainly prefer that, such political talks, at any rate in the first stage, should take place in London.* No. 4.
allocation and distribution of world food supplies to all importing countries fora considerable period probably at least two years- after the war. Is it intended that Food Conference should only consider longer-range plans starting.after thisperiod? If so, is it intended that Relief Conference should discuss not onlypolitical set-up of U.N.R.R.A. but practical measures to organise productionand allocation of food and other supplies? This is the urgent aspect of foodarrangements and if the United States Government agree that it should be covered by the Relief Conference, we are, of course, ready to agree, but it appearsto us that, in that event, the Relief Conference will cover a good deal of groundwhich would be appropriate to a Food Conference. If, however, these widersupply aspects of the Relief period are not to be covered by the Relief Conference,it seems to us important to make clear that they will be considered by the food conference. &apos; For this purpose would it be possible to include in the scope of theFood Conference such questions as (a) the structural modifications which have taken place during the war inthe production of food and other essential agricultural products, andthe extent to which these modifications are likely to be maintainedafter the war; and . &apos;&apos;.(&amp;.) the measures required to organise the production of food and other essential agricultural products and to allocate the world supplies available so as to meet as fully as possible the probable needs of importing countries during the earlier post-war years and. the transi-tional problems which will arise as agricultural production is restored in war-ravaged areas.2. I should be grateful if you could clear, up the position of the UnitedStates Government on this point, which is of great importance.3.   Repeated to Moscow and to Dominions.(6)      ^ .        &apos;   .From Washington to Foreign Office, dated 17th March, 1943.(No. 1269.)Your telegram No. 1684.*It is unlikely that Secretary of State will be able to discuss this matter indetail.  I should &quot;therefore like to clear position with you as far as possible;.2. All evidence is that food was selected by President as subject for firstconference because he is seeking least controversial matter possible. There is no evidence that he will have in his mind, unless we put it there, idea of settlingregular procedure for post-war economic discussions generally. From variousrepresentatives of White House and State Department we have heard such sugges-.tions as that Mr. Paul Appleby might be chairman of conference, that HisMajesty&apos;s Government could easily send Sir John Orr or MacDougall [sic&apos;] to,represent them, and that conference on food might be followed by conferences onclothing and housing. I do not suggest that more responsible heads of state department would be satisfied by this position, and probably they are consideringvery much same questions and same alternatives as in your paragraph 3. If, how-ever, this food conference is to be facade for initiation of talks on major subjectsit is clear that representation of United States and United Kingdom must be quite different from representation if alternative (a) holds the field.3, I.feel strongly that there is a danger that United States Government maylose sight of discussions contemplated in Article VII, a view which you shared inyour draft telegram referred to in your paragraph 1. Whether or not letter of.acceptance has been sent to the United States Government, might we not suggestamending invitation to relate food conference to Article VII by prefixing phrase&quot; having regard to principles of Atlantic Charter and objectives of Article VIIof Mutual Aid Agreements &quot; ? ,4. As regards actual draft terms of reference included in State Depart-ment&apos;s letter, points 2 and 3, although not intended to do so, could be made tocover discussion of buffer stocks, stabilisation of&apos; commodity prices and in generalmonetary commercial policy and Other questions raised in Article VII. It is, as you point out, illogical to deal with these subjects in connexion with food and agricultural products only.    United States Government usually fight shy of* No. 4. &apos;.
suggestions.of an international discussion of buffer stocks and might dislike ideaof its.being ventilated at this conference. It is, however, to be considered,supposing this opportunity to be lost, what other chance we may have of gettingour ideas placed before United Nations.5. With reference to draft telegram referred to in paragraph 1 of yourtelegram, do you wish me to press for a general conference leading up to establish-ment of a steering committee of United Nations and formulation by it of an agreed agenda to govern future discussions, or, failing that, for drawing up before any conference is held of an agenda by American and British experts for circulation to Russia, China and thereafter to United Nations ?6. Incidentally, I understand that suggestion now is to have food conterencesomewhere near Washington.(7)From Washington to Foreign Office, dated 18th &apos;March, 1943.(No. 1297.)My telegram No. 1269,* paragraph 1.I instructed Economic Adviser to air informally with Pasvolsky points inyour telegram 1684, t paragraphs 3-6, and your telegram No. 168542.   Following five points were raised :--(i) Necessity of drawing a line of demarcation between relief and foodconferences..(ii) Political importance of not creating impression that relief is beingrelegated to background,(iii) Terms of reference and procedure in food conference. With referenceto heads 2 and 3 in draft invitation, would conference (1) discuss indetail these questions from food aspect alone, (2) merely pass resolu-tions that something was to be done about these questions, or (3)discuss in detail all aspects of these questions notwithstanding factthat they involve more food and agricultural products? It waspointed out that (1) and (3) especially would require careful prepara-tion and that even (2) would, too, if conference were to do more thanmerely pass pious resolutions,(iv), Pasvolsky was asked whether an agenda or draft papers were being prepared and, if so, whether State Department would keep HisMajesty&apos;s Government informed confidentially,(v) His Majesty&apos;s Government was interested in whole question of procedure in dealing with questions under article VII, all of which wereintimately related to one another. It was necessary to avoid, on onehand, a grand conference that would discuss everything at once andachieve nothing, on the other hand, a series of unrelated conferenceson bits of problem which would be chaotic and likewise achievenothing. Unless ideas were carefully worked out regarding machineryfor relating separate sets of discussion it would be impossible to makeorderly progress.3. Pasvolsky said that while he could not usefully comment he thoughtthat this formal airing of points was most useful but he urged that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should put forward these and other suggestions that they might wish to make formally as soon as possible. They would be most valuable to united States Government if they were received while ideas on procedure were-being worked out. He would report to the Secretary that these five points hadbeen raised informally as an indication of what His Majesty?s Government werethinking.4. Pasvolsky commented on above points as his personal view and in strict confidence as follows :  . ,    .-.(i) Structural modification in agriculture and production plans duringrelief period should be included in terms of reference of food con-ference. He is anxious to see United Nations machinery established as soon as possible for dealing with long-run problems of this kind which it is not function of relief organisation to deal with but whichthey might be drawn into in absence of appropriate machinery for purpose.* No. 6. t No. 4. \ No. 5.
(ii) If only for this reason, he would definitely prefer to see food conferenceconvened first, though he quite agreed that steps would-have to betaken to allay fear that relief was being relegated to background.(iii) He agreed that question of procedure to ensure fruitful discussion wasian urgent one. Without saying so, he conveyed impression that, evenif United States Government had given consideration to question,nothing had been decided. &apos; ;5. I hope that Pasvolsky&apos;s personal comments may be treated as strictly confidential and that special care will be taken that they are not reported back to washington by United States Embassy, as has happened on a previous occasion.They are important as indicating why he stated so emphatically that it would be most useful if His Majesty&apos;s Governments ideas on procedure could be put for-&apos;ward as soon as possible. State Department probably think much as we do on question of procedure, and chance of a satisfactory outcome would be greater ifwe could strengthen their hand by putting forward our own positive ideas as soonas possible. ;..   , .   &apos; (8) &apos;; From Foreign Office to Washington, dated 20th March, 1943.(No. 1814.)Your telegrams Nos. 1269* and 12971 [of 16th and 18th March: food conference in the United States of America].We did not expect that the Secretary of State himself would find time todeal with these complicated problems, except perhaps in a very general way, butwe hoped that you or a member of your staff would be able to put the points whichwe think need clarification to Berle, Pasvolsky, and possibly Acheson, with aview to eliciting as soon as possible an answer having, anyhow, the authority ofMr. SumUer Welles behind it.2. You should therefore now make formal communication as soon aspossible, introducing at the appropriate point suggestion contained in para-graph 3 of your telegram No. 1269,* with which we agree. Communication shouldalso Gover points (i), (ii) and (iii) in paragraph 2 of your telegram No. 1297. t Asregards the third point, you should make it clear that we consider it essential,that the Conference should be so conducted as to confine itself to foodstuffs andother essential agricultural products and only pave the way for subsequent and separate discussion of related questions (currency, commercial policy, &amp;c.) when there has been plenty of time for the necessary preparation.3.   Have either of the other two Governments replied?   If so, in whatsense ? !* No. 6. t No. 7. &apos;        :-From Washington to Foreign Office, dated 23rd March, 1943.(No. 1358.)Your telegram No. 1814.*I have drafted a statement which might serve as an aide memoire following:my discussion of this subject with Hull or Welles. Text in my immediately following telegram, t2. This draft and any comments that you might make could be showninformally to Pasvolsky and possibly Berle or Acheson before the final form wasadopted. It is thought here that the last paragraph of the draft is adequate tocover the points in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the draft telegram referred to inparagraph 1 of your telegram No. 16844 Reference to representatives of theDominions, European Allies or Latin Americans would come best in oraldiscussion if you desire me to make special mention of this point.* No. 8.       &apos;   &apos;&quot; &apos; &apos; f No. 10. % No. 4.
From Washington to Foreign Office, dated 23rd March, 1943.(No. 3 359.)My immediately preceding telegram.*I have the honour to refer to the reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government to theletter from the United States Charge d&apos;Aff&apos;aires of the 10th March relating tothe proposed Food Conference, in which His Majesty&apos;s Government stated thatthey were carefully considering what positive suggestions they could offer tofacilitate the work of the Conference. His Majesty&apos;s Government think it very desirable that the proposed Food Conference should be recognised as forming partof a general programme which will include the various discussions which willbe necessary on the methods of achieving the objectives contemplated in Article 7of the Mutual Aid Agreement of the 23rd February, 1942. With a view toindicating to the United Nations that the proposed Food Conference is part ofa general programme, His Majesty&apos;s Government would suggest that the words&quot; having regard to the principles of the Atlantic Charter and the objectives ofthe Mutual Aid Agreements &apos;&apos; should be prefixed: to the invitation which theGovernment of the United States proposes to send to the United Nations. HisMajesty&apos;s Government agree that the consideration of post-war plans by the food conference should be divorced from the question of the provision of relief, andthey attach importance to the drawing of a careful line of demarcation betweenthe terms of reference of the Food Conference and the Relief Conference. HisMajesty&apos;s Government assume that such questions as structural modifications which have taken place during the war in the production of food and other essential agricultural products, the extent to which such modifications are likelybe maintained after the war and measures required to organise the productionof food and other essential agricultural products during the period of relief andsubsequently would fall within the scope of the Food Conference. Nevertheless,His Majesty&apos;s Government attach importance to avoiding the creation of theimpression amongst the European and other Allied. Governments that the problemof relief is in danger of being relegated to the background. It would thereforebe desirable, before convening the Food Conference, to consider what steps couldbe taken to explain to the Allied Governments the demarcation between the scopeof the Food and Relief Conferences and to provide adequate measures forconnecting the two sets of discussions as the best means of indicating that the urgent problems of relief were not being ignored or neglected. In defining thescope of the Food Conference His Majesty&apos;s Government consider it essentialto the development of orderly procedure in the general programme of discussionsunder Article 7 that the terms of reference for the Food Conference should be such as to ensure that the discussions would be confined to foodstuffs and other essential agricultural products and only pave the way for the subsequent and separate discussion of related economic questions, which will be held when therehas been adequate time for the necessary preparation. In regard to further development of procedure in the general programme of discussions underArticle 7, His Majesty&apos;s Government always believed that the most satisfactory way of making progress would be to reach, if possible, preliminary agreementbetween the United States and the United Kingdom. Having achieved a measureof agreement His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government wouldthen consult the Soviet and the Chinese Governments and subsequently approach the other members of the United Nations. In any case, as part of the machineryfor discussion of the several economic questions in separate but relatedconferences, His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that it would be indispensable tohave some steering or co-ordinating committee generally representative of theUnited Nations. Such a committee would facilitate the taking of preliminarysoundings and the carrying out of the preparatory work which are essential tothe successful outcome of International Conferences.* No. 9.(11)From Washington to Foreign Office, dated 23rd March, 1943.(No. 1374.)Your telegram,No. 1814.*&apos;Russia has now accepted, China having already accepted promptly.- &apos; . * No. 8, ,, .
