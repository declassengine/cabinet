THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1943.SECRET.Copy No.o 0W.P. (43) 136.April 5, 1943.WAR CABINET.POST-WAR COMMERCIAL POLICY.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and:. the President of the Board of Trade.THE question of our future commercial policy has recently been consideredby the Ministers chiefly concerned under the Chairmanship of the Lord President.A divergence of views appeared, and it was felt that the Dominion Govern-ments should now be consulted, since their attitude might influence the WarCabinet-s final decision. A note by the President of the Board of Trade focussingthe main issues is attached (Appendix A).The outline of a telegram to the Dominions has been prepared accordingly,and a copy is attached (Appendix B). Its somewhat unusual form,is due to thedesire of Ministers to put fully and objectively to the Dominion Governments thevarious views held here.But the draft telegram brings clearly to light the difficulties of this kind of approach, and we feel that the matter should be brought to the notice of the WarCabinet before the issues are put to the Dominions in this way.Since we may have to enter into early discussions with the TJnited States on commercial policy under the terms of Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreementthere should, in any case, be a speedy exchange of views with the Dominions.It would; of course, much help such an exchange, if at the outset, we could give some indication of the policy which we favour. Even so, however, thesequestions are so important and raise so many political issues in the Dominions,that it seems doubtful whether long-range consultation by telegraph will succeed1in clearing the ground. There is no time to lose and, in our opinion, the.best course would be,.for our approach to the Dominions to conclude with an invitation to them to send experts to London within, say, four weeks to confer upon the whole matter. If this is approved, the telegram could be confined to a statement Of thegeneral problem and the main issues likely to arise with such indication of ourpreliminary views as the War Cabinet may feel able to give.C. R. A.H. D.April 5, 1943.[25264]b
Note by the President of the Board of Trade.1. THE aim of this Note is to summarise, for the convenience of mycolleagues, the differences which have emerged in our discussions and the main points on which decisions by the War Cabinet are now sought. This Note, is thus a summary of the attached telegram.2. Broadly speaking, three views are held among the Ministers chiefly concerned.3. View A is that a general clearance of barriers to world trade is particu-larly in the interest of this country. Unless such barriers can be largely broken down, we cannot hope either for full employment in our export trades or for improved standards of living in this Island. Such a clearance can best be secured,not by a series of bilateral trade agreements but by a multilateral commercialconvention, open to adherence by all States including the defeated States, on terms to be prescribed by the victors. Under the terms of this convention, tariffsshould be restricted to a moderate level, preferences substantially reduced, export subsidies prohibited, State Trading regulated so as to avoid discrimination orexcessive protection, and quantitative import restrictions permitted only withinstrictly defined limits. There should be an interim post-war period during whichthese restrictions might continue,&apos; though on a diminishing scale, and, after thisperiod, such restrictions should only be used by any country for certain agreedpurposes, e.g., to safeguard its balance of payments or to protect industriesessential to its national security. Disputed cases should be settled by a suitableinternational authority.4. Those who hold View A argue that these arrangements would be speciallyfavourable to the restoration of our balance of payments, since other countries unless-their balance was in danger would be obliged to remove their restrictionson our exports, while we should be entitled to regulate imports so long as ourown balance was in danger. Unless we are prepared to limit our own use of import restrictions, other countries will not limit theirs. The interests of british agriculture, it is held, could be safeguarded, under these proposals, by means, of subsidies, State importation and moderate tariffs. We should take the initiative in proposing such a plan to the United States and to the other United Nations.5. View B is largely in accord with View A. &apos; It favours a single multi-lateral, rather than a bunch of bilateral; agreements. It also favours our takingthe initiative in making proposals to the United States, since an Americaninitiative might drive us on to the defensive and might propose, e.g., the. abolitionof all imperial preferences and of all quantitative import restrictions, in returnfor quite inadequate tariff reductions by the United States. It agrees that areduction of tariffs all over the world would suit our trade and that we shouldproclaim this as our aim. But View B differs from View A on quantitativeimport restrictions. We should $iot bind ourselves, it is held, to any limitations on the use of such restrictions, which may be vital to the maintenance of our balance of payments, though we should express the hope gradually to relax these restrictions and, in any case, to use them without discrimination or political bias.While prepared to contemplate reductions in Dominion preferences in return for adequate reductions in the United States tariff, we should retain complete liberty to make any preferential arrangements we choose with the Colonies. We shouldnot be committed to particular time-tables or to go faster than the economic policies of the rest of the world justify. We should discourage export subsidies,and be on our guard against unreasonable claims by other countries to protectindustries on grounds of &quot; defence.&quot; An international commercial organisation should be set up, and we should do our best to help and strengthen it. But, though we wish to escape from the choking tangle of bilateral agreements on trade and money, we should not; at this stage, agree to give to such an international body theright to determine, or pass judgment on, our own commercial policy.6. View C is in sharp opposition to View A, and also, on a number ofimportant points, to View B. The problem of our balance of payments will be soacute that we must in no way limit our right to regulate imports and we should in no case submit our use of import restrictions to approval by an international body. So far View C and View B are in agreement, but from this point theydiverge. According to View C, quantitative import restrictions are, quite apart
from &quot;the balance of payments, a sound and permanent instrument of national planning. A general reduction of trade barriers, even if practicable, would notnecessarily be of benefit to this country. No limitation should be imposed on theuse of State trading. Experience shows that bilateral treaties give better resultsthan attempts at multilateral arrangements. It would, in. any case, be a mistakefor us to make proposals to the United States. We should be content with theinitiatives we have already taken and be prepared to wait and probably to resist the demands of others, till more is known regarding post-war conditions. Thevalue of the British market gives us a strong bargaining position and we shouldwait to be wooed.7. There are three main issues, on which, I suggest, the War Cabinet should now decide (a) Do we favour multilateral, or bilateral, arrangements for future inter-national trade?(b) Should we insist on retaining complete freedom to impose quantitativeimport restrictions, or should we express our willingness to confine their use, on condition that other countries do the same, to (i) an interim period of adjustment,(ii) subsequently to certain agreed purposes, e.g., to maintain our balance of payments?(c) Shall we take the initiative in setting our views before the United Statesand other United Nations or shall we await proposals from them 1H. DBoard of Trade, Millbank,April 5, 1943.APPENDIX B.Draft Telegram to the Domini on Governments.1. It appears that the time is rapidly approaching when we shall have to open conversations with the United States Government on the questions of post-war commercial policy contemplated in Article 7 of the Mutual Aid Agree-ment. The United States Governments invitation to the Food Conference to be opened on the 27th April suggests, as Problem No. 3 for exploration by. that conference, &quot;Trade, financial and other arrangements necessary to enable thecountries of the world fco obtain the food-stuffs and other essential agricultural products which they need and to maintain adequate markets for their own surplusproduction.&quot; But evidently such arrangements cannot usefully be considered in relation only to food-stuffs and agricultural products in isolation; they will raise general problems of international trade interchanges and commercial policy.2. We ought therefore to lose no time in formulating our provisional andgeneral views on commercial policy in preparation for conversations of a tentativeand exploratory character with the United States authorities.3. Article 7 of the Mutual Aid Agreement, after referring to action directed to the expansion of production, employment and the exchange and consumptionof goods, goes on to state the objective of &quot; the elimination of all forms ofdiscriminator)^ treatment in international commerce and the reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers &quot; as well as, in general, the attainment of all the economic objectives set out in the Atlantic Charter. It seems clear that the objective ofan expansionist world must be approached from a number of angles, action on each of which must be mter-dependent. Thus there will be need for (1) aninternational monetary mechanism for restoring the multilateral character ofinternational payments; (2) action to prevent recurrence of world-wide economicdepressions; possibly ^ (3) arrangements for enlarged international investment,and, finally, (4) appropriate measures in the field of commercial policy. All thesesteps will need to be undertaken more or less concurrently.4. In considering commercial policy, the attitude of United StatesGovernment will of course be a most important factor. Must we expect themto look for (a.) drastic modification or even abolition of Imperial Preferences and(b) abolition of import restrictions as a unilateral instrument of protection?Will there be reluctance on their part to face the need for substantial reduction[25264] -        &quot; b 2
of their own tariffs, to the extent demanded by their creditor position andprobably going well beyond the limits at present set to their action by the reciprocal Trade Agreements Acts (under which they cannot reduce their dutiesby more than half from the high level of their 1930 Tariff, and even then onlyagainst equivalent concessions) ? Are they likely to cause difficulties with russia by seeking to treat State Trading as an undesirable development which oughtto be abolished ?5. We evidently need to reckon with the risk that the United States willtake insufficient account of the difficulties of other countries (the United Kingdomand European countries in particular) and expect from them drastic steps to abolish or modify those forms of &quot; discriminations&quot; and trade barriers whichthe latter employ, but the United States do not to any extent, such as preferences,quantitative restrictions and State trading, while remaining unwilling to go farin granting freer access to their own market by large reductions of their tariff.In such circumstances many of the economic and monetary troubles of theinter-war period, resulting from the unwillingness of the United States to acceptrepayment from her debtors in goods and services, must be expected to recursooner or later.6. Broadly speaking, three types of view have emerged as the result of theconsideration so far given here to these problems. One view, hereafter called&quot; View A,&quot; is that the risk mentioned in paragraph 5 would best be guarded against by attempting to secure United States adherence to a comprehensive scheme for a multilateral agreement laying down rules of conduct and general lines of action to be taken by countries in matters of commercial policy. Thehope would be that such a multilateral agreement, under which the members would, associate themselves in a &quot; Commercial Union,&quot; would receive wideacceptance among United Nations and neutrals and might be imposed onex-enemies.7. Broadly, this would involve a first informal and explanatory approach to United States authorities on the following lines :  - We should start by outlining the nature of the problems with which thiscountry, and probably other countries, will be faced after the war, and should goon to say that in our opinion (i) An international commercial policy capable of helping towards thesolution of those problems would have to be accompanied by some formof multilateral clearing and the adoption of a system which allowsand encourages an expansive world economy,(ii) Proposals should also be based on the assumption of a multilateralcommercial pohcj^ agreement, embracing most of the major countries.It is impossible for this country to be put into a satisfactory tradeposition by any concessions which the United States alone is in aposition to give us, however liberal. On the other hand, we may have much to gain from a general policy of this kind covering our customersand suppliers generally.(iii) The United Kingdom, both by tradition and by experience, regards anincreased freedom of trade as particularly in her interest. We shalljoin in any movement \p secure it and, when it comes down to practice,we are the least likely quarter in which to find opposition. our sympathy is entirely with those who are seeking to remove barriersto trade. Any qualifications we have to make are entirely due to thespecial difficulties of the immediate post-war period and the present uncertainty as to what will, in fact, lie within our power and thatof other countries.(iv) We will accept a moderate ceiling for tariffs for incorporation in a multilateral agreement,(v) We are prepared to make all our arrangements, including particularlyquantitative restriction of imports, on a basis of mutual non-dis-crimination. Preferences, which we do not regard as discriminatoryin a strict sense of the. word, are dealt with below.&apos; (vl) Quite apart from our own position, a general plan should leave room for special arrangements within political and geographical groups,since these are likely to be asked for and can be properly conceded inmany cases. As part of a comprehensive scheme for the bettermentof the trade of the world as a whole, we are prepared to play our full part in any general scheme for reducing preferences.
(vii) We consider that the quantitative regulation of imports should notordinarily be employed for the primary purpose of protecting homeindustries, but rather regarded as a mechanism appropriate and useful for special purposes, including, among others, the safeguarding of a country&apos;s balance of payments and for implementing approved inter-national commodity agreements and on security grounds. We areprepared to agree from the outset that such regulations should be on anon-discriminatory basis. We shall gladly give it up altogether as a means of safeguarding our balance of payments as soon as it is clearthat we can afford to do without it. But we can see no likelihood, inthe best of circumstances to be expected, of our becoming independent of it in the near future,(viii) We are prepared to agree to measures designed to prevent export subsidies.(ix) State trading should not be prohibited, but should be conducted inaccordance with a code to be agreed.(x) We believe that these points could best be covered by the formulation ofa general code of commercial practice to which all countries would beinvited to subscribe.8.   The broad and general statement on these lines could be amplified byoutlining, by way of example, specimen heads of a multilateral convention.Such heads might be A. Preferences.(i) Existing preference margins in the Empire and elsewhere to be reducedby a substantial percentage of their pre-war level, with a proviso thatno margin need be reduced to below, say, 5 per cent, ad valorem.(ii) No new preferences or Customs Unions to be established without theconsent of the Commercial Union.B. Tariffs.(i) A maximum ceiling of moderate height should be established for allad valorem duties with a corresponding limit for specific duties.(Rules for determining the ad valorem incidence of specific duties would be framed.) This ceiling would have the great advantage ofrequiring the United States to do more than the majority of othercountries.(ii) Duties below the &quot; ceiling &quot; would be reduced by some agreed percentageof their pre-war level, with the proviso that no duty need be reducedto below, say, 10 per cent, ad valorem,(iii) These proposals should relate only to the protective element in duties,i.e., they would not limit revenue duties (which would be defined bya suitable formula).(iv) The proposals would be subject to any exceptions approved by theCommercial Union, in consultation on political aspects with any other appropriate international body, for the protection of industriesnecessary on security grounds.(It is probable that the cut of preference margins proposed in A (i) above will mean, if the margin is reduced from the upper end only, that our generalrates of duty would have to be reduced to a greater extent than the duties offoreign countries which have been cut below the ceiling under B (ii). To avoid this situation it may be necessary to close the preference &apos;&apos; gap &apos;&apos; from both ends,and this would mean the imposition of a low rate of duty on a range of Empireproducts which at present enjoy free entry.)C. Subsidies.(i) State action resulting in the sale of goods in foreign markets at priceslower than home market prices would be forbidden. (This is toprevent wasteful competition in subsidies.)(ii) Apart from this, countries should be free to protect home production by direct subsidies. (This would be a safety-valve, and together withtariffs of the permitted height, would allow &quot; undeveloped &quot; countries to industrialise to a reasonable extent.) ,D. Quantitative Import Restrictions.(i) For, say, the first two years after-the war it should be permissible forany Government to control imports quantitatively, so long as this was done in an equitable and non-discriminatory manner.[25264] &quot; b 3
(ii) After the two-year period, Governments would remove their restrictionsby progressive steps over, say, three years, except for the following catergories or other categories approved by the Commercial Union : (a) The usual exceptions on grounds of health, &amp;c.(b) Action in respect of recognised international commodity agree-ments and other special agreements affecting production ofand/or trade in particular commodities which may be reached between two or more Governments and approved by theCommercial Union. (This would leave room for &quot; planning &quot;of the trade in particular commodities, provided the plans met with a reasonable measure of international agreement.)(c) Subject to confirmation by an international monetary authority onthe ground of the existing or prospective state of a country&apos;balance of payments.(d) Subject to a proviso as at B (iv) above, for protection of industriesnecessary on security grounds.E. State Trading.(i) State trading should not be prohibited.(ii) But discriminatory misuse of State trading should be prevented by rulesbased generally on Article 8 of the United States-United kingdom trade Agreement of 1938, providing that State Trading monopoliesshould be guided solely by economic considerations.(iii) State trading organisations should be free to make contracts of longer term than normal, provided these contracts are based only on economic considerations.F. The Commercial Union.The above suggested code of rules should be embodied in a multilateral convention Which would establish a Commercial Union ofthe member States. To prevent the formation of rival blocs, every endeavour should be made to secure the adherence of all the united nations and the leading neutrals. Ex-enemy States might be requiredto adhere to the Union on terms, in order to prevent them from againdeveloping undesirable economic practices.The Commercial Union would need a Council or Conference of its members to supervise its operation. This body should have power to expel a member for persistent disregard of the rules.There would also be a fact-finding body with quasi-judicial functions, called perhaps the &quot; International Commerce Commission,&quot;to which any member State could appeal when aggrieved by action of another member in contravention of rules of the Union.9. A few explanations of these proposals should be given. In the firstplace, the view is widely held here that a multilateral agreement for reducingtrade barriers has great advantages over bilateral negotiations (i) in holding out a prospect of rapid and widespread results in the specially fluid post-waratmosphere; (ii) no country would be required to give concessions to othercountries which give no concessions in return. The latter consideration isparticularly important for us, since the United States will presumably look fordrastic modification of Imperial Preferences, but could give us no adequatereturn under bilateral negotiations. In short, it is felt that it is only as partof a large-scale multilateral agreement that we could justifiably undertake a comprehensive and substantial modification of Imperial Preference. Those who take &apos;&apos; View A &apos;&apos; also hold that an approach on positive and constructive lines would help to strengthen the hands of the United States Administration inreconciling their public opinion to large reductions of their tariff, and Congressmight thus be induced to take the steps necessary if any widespread revival ofinternational trade is to be realised.10. The question of quantitative import restrictions is specially difficult and has given rise to much discussion here.(i) Such restrictions were condemned in the inter-war period by severalinternational conferences on the ground that they inflict on international trade the evils of uncertainty and delay and the risk of unfair discrimination. other objections raised against them are that they limit the growth and development
of.trade with particular rigidity, not allowing that degree of adaptation whichis possible under tariffs, and&apos; they &apos;go far to abolish competition as an effectivefactor in international trade. Moreover, experience has &apos; shown the practical difficulty of operating import restrictions in non-discriminatory manner.(ii) Others, however, hold that, in addition to being a valuable means of assisting countries to maintain their balance of payments, the system of quantita-tive control of imports has the following advantages :--(a) it would enable Governments to maintain domestic production in selectedindustries, e.g., agriculture in this country, at a predetermined level;(b) it provides the most effective safeguard against any sudden onset of low-wage or State-aided competition.It has been argued that in those ways the system could, if skilfully used,enable a degree of economic stability to be attained which would be impossibleunder the free play of competition.(iii) However, the adherents of &quot;View A&quot; foresee the following gravedangers unless the use of import restrictions in the post-war wdrld is carefullylimited by international agreement: (a) This country could not expect to be alone in applying a general policy of import restriction, and experience shows that United Kingdom exporttrade is peculiarly vulnerable to such practices.(b) Conflicts arising between unco-ordinated national control systems would lead to serious damage to international commerce and possibly todangerous political friction between Governments.(c) United States opinion is most unlikely to agree to any significant reduction of the United States tariff if the field is left open forunlimited import restrictions.(iv) Adherents.of &quot; View A &quot; therefore hold that without limitation of theuse of import restrictions a fatal gap would be left in any proposals for thereduction of barriers to international trade. They hold that the chief cases whereimport restrictions could safely and legitimately be employed would be (a) Where agreements are reached between two or more countries regardingthe production of or trade in particular commodities which requireimport restrictions for their effective enforcement -subject always to such agreements being approved by the Commercial Union as beingconsonant with the general interest.(b) Where their use is thought necessary on the ground of the existing orprospective state of a country&apos;s balance of payments, subject to confirmation by an international monetary body, such as the Clearing-Union.(c) For the protection of industries judged by an appropriate international body to be necessary on security grounds.Adherents of &quot;View A&quot; recognise, however, that in the immediate post-war period many disturbing factors will influence the general situation, and they therefore recommend a procedure under which, while the application of the ruleslimiting import restrictions would be somewhat delayed, Governments would stand committed to final and collective application of the rules.11. &quot; View B.&quot; The second alternative view may be called &quot;View B.&quot;In general, the differences between &quot; View B &quot; and &quot; View A &quot; are of emphasisrather than of substance, except on one vital point, namely, that of quantitativeimport restrictions. Exponents of &quot;View B&quot; see little hope of closing the prospective gap in our balance of payments by export expansion alone&quot; and consider therefore (in agreement with &apos;&apos; View C &apos;&apos; later described) that we mustretain the unfettered right to apply import restrictions on any scale, to any commodity and for an indefinite period. This difference of&apos; view is crucial andappears likely to have a profound influence on any discussions with-the UnitedStates authorities. Adherents of &quot;View B&quot; stress that it is in our general interest.to make it plain to the United States that a great responsibility restsupon a large creditor nation if world trade is to move freely, but point out thatwe do not know, despite pronouncements by members of the Administration, whatthe attitude of the United States really is in. this crucial matter. They urge thatit would be a profound mistake not to bring out fully the difficult financial conditions in which this country will find itself after the war or to promise morethan we are likely to be able to do while these conditions persist.
12.   Shortly, &quot; View B&quot; involves the following line of approach to thiscountry&apos;s problems : (a) The United Kingdom&apos;s economic position Will be governed after the-war by the acute problem of its balance of payments. We are theworld&apos;s-largest market for many commodities, and it is therefore-,essential, even in the interests of the world as a whole, that our inter-,national trading position should, be brought into equilibrium as soonas possible.We shall aim at securing this by expanding our exports. but many countries will similarly be pushing their- own competing exports and some-of them, particularly the large agricultural countries whichhave been our chief markets, &quot;will be fostering industrial production.Thus we cannot expect that the increase of our exports necessary, to;restore our balance of payments will be quickly achieved. We shall,,therefore, be bound to limit our foreign payments by restriction ofimports, though we should hope gradually to relax these restrictions.,(b) We should in manv cases prefer to restrict imports by quantitative!.restriction rather than by high duties, since the latter will noteffectively shut out non-necessary imports. .(c) We should&apos; hope to be able to use quantitative restriction without discrimination or political bias.(d) As regards Dominion preferences, we must move together with theDominions. If the Dominions are disposed to make substantial reduc-tions in preferences in return for the lowering of United. States tariffswe should not be disposed to stand in the way; but we must recognisethat the value of am^ tariff concessions which the United States might make would only be&apos; of limited advantage to United Kingdom exporttrade and. would be insufficient to compensate for substantial reductions in Dominion preferences. Thus Dominion preferences willbe an important factor to be taken into account in estimating theUnited Kingdom&apos;s position, and we must be very circumspect incontemplating their modification till we see more clearly what theUnited States are prepared tc do about their own tariff.On Colonial preferences the issue is different. We must affordgreater assistance to some of our Colonies than in the past and, must therefore retain our liberty to have such a preferential system withour Colonies as is justifiable in the legitimate interests of both. Suchpreferences need not necessarily be by way of duty differences.     -(,e) On tariffs, it is agreed that, on balance, a reduction of tariffs all overthe world would assist our tiT&amp;cl e. But we cannot be sure that othercountries will have the same aim or agree to give effect to it. Manywill. have balance of payments difficulties similar to our own, and various agricultural countries will decide to diversify their production.In view of these doubts about the attitude of other countries wemust make it plain in any discussions with the United states authorities that our policy in regard to reduction of tariffs and prefer-ences depends absolutely on a general arrangement for these purposes,covering all the major trading countries.(/) We should not be committed to particular time-tables or to go faster thanthe economic policiesAjf the rest of the world justify. The problem of low-cost competition may not disappear after the war, but may comefrom more countries than before.(g) We should generally oppose export subsidies, and should want the UnitedStates to agree that shipping subsidies, should not be paid by governments.13.   Adherents of &apos;.* View B &quot; consider that it would be desirable to attemptto create an international organisation which would review commercial policies,of member countries.   The development of such an organisation must, however,proceed slowly : we should not agree that an untried and experimental organisa-tion should have powrer to determine the commercial policy&apos;of member States.,Nevertheless, the experiment of an international, consultative body should be seriously tried if we are to escape from the tangle of bilateral trade and monetary.arrangements and from the clash of nationalist economic policies.   It is suggestedthat this piece-meal and unspectacular method will be fraught with, less danger,than an attempt to bring controversial, international questions, whether economic;,/monetary or political, before one large international assembly.
14. &quot; View C.&quot; The need to retain full freedom of action for an indefinite period in the matter of import restriction is still more strongly stressed byadherents of &quot; View C,&quot; which is in practically direct opposition to &quot; View A.&quot;(i) They argue that the primary obligation to adopt measures which wouldpromote increased imports rests on countries whose balance of payments is likelyto be unduly favourable; countries in a weak position can only proceed cautiouslyin this direction. Such considerations should be emphasised in discussions withthe United States.(ii) They also argue that proposals of the type put forward by adherentsof &quot; View A &quot; would not contribute to the solution of this difficulty and mayaggravate it. United States industry is efficient and well equipped; thus evenrelatively substantial reductions of United States tariffs might not result in alarge-scale expansion of United Kingdom -exports to the United States. Theyquestion the idea that the main advantages to United Kingdom export trade would come from relaxation of trade barriers in other markets, largely on theground that the tariff reduction proposals would be applied more slowly and lessiefficiently to the duties of other countries (which are mostly &quot; specific &quot;) than toours (which are mostly &quot; ad valorem &quot;). But the adherents of &quot; View A &quot; thinkthat this difficulty can be largely overcome.(iii) Thus we should, &quot; View C &quot; holds, have to make immediate reductionsiof our ad valorem duties, and stand to lose from reductions of preferences inEmpire countries, without the assurance of early and commensurate gainselsewhere.(iv) In these circumstances our balance of payments might continue seriouslyadverse, and we should (under the &quot; View A &quot; proposals) have to appeal to theinternational monetary authority for a dispensation to continue import restric-tions. But such a step might impair our prestige and spread distrust of our economic position and the stability of our currency.(v) As to import restrictions, proponents of &quot;View C &quot; do not agree thatthese are inherently objectionable. They hold that under modern conditionssteadiness in the flow of trade is no less important than expansion of its volume,and that quantitative regulation possesses decided advantages where stabilityis the aim; e.g., it may be desired again to apply import restrictions to certainagricultural commodities in order to secure reasonable stability for UnitedKingdom agriculture.(vi) By quantitative regulation, a country can decide how much it willimport of a given commodity instead of leaving this to the chances of the market.Thus the method is closely associated with the idea of planning, and to try to forbid or obstruct it is qualified as incompatible with the needs and tendencies ofthe modern age. -(vii) On State trading they hold that the idea of requiring State tradingorganisations to behave like private traders in a competitive market is funda-mentally unsound. Central buying organisations should have regard to a great variety of considerations that a competing private trader might disregard.(Against this, adherents of &quot; View A &quot; point to the instability likely to result from the introduction of political considerations into commercial affairs.)15.   Adherents of &quot;View C &quot; therefore hold that not only should we not put to the United States proposals such as those favoured by adherents ofView A,&quot; but that Ave should resist them if proposed by others, on the groundthat satisfactory rules for commercial policy cannot be devised till more is known about probable post-war conditions.16.   The main questions at issue are: -(i) The multilateral versus the bilateral approach: i.e., whether the attempt should be made to secure a simultaneous reduction of obstacles to trade over a wide area by. means of a multilateral agreement between a large number of countries, or whether reliance should continue to be placed on the method ofcommercial negotiations between particular pairs of countries. This question isargued in paragraph 9 above.(ii) Import restrictions. By far the most vital question at issue concernsquantitative import restrictions, and is whether we should (a) insist on retainingfull and unfettered freedom to use such restrictions for an indefinite period, or(&amp;) signify our willingness to abandon them as a normal instrument of protection,subject to other countries doing so. at the same time, after an interim perioddetermined m agreement with those countries, and to agree that afterwards thevshall only be used under international authority for certain limited purposes eg
to correct an unbalanced payments position, to implement international commodity agreements, or on security grounds.The latter course is regarded by adherents of &quot; View A &quot; as an essential partof their case and as vital to the possibility of reaching an agreement with theUnited States authorities, who a^-e known to attach great importance to theabolition of protective import restrictions. On &quot; View A,&quot; action in respect ofall the various types of trade barrier must be interdependent, and it would beof no use to limit tariffs while leaving room for the raising of equivalent barriersin the form of quantitative restrictions. If one Government insists on retainingunfettered liberty to apply import restrictions, other countries will do the same,with the risk of serious prejudice to our export trade and to the expansionistaims of Article 7 of the Mutual Aid Agreement. The dangers apprehended by others in a general renunciation of import restrictions would on &quot; View A &quot; be-met by the transitional period and thereafter by the provision for agreed use ofsuch restrictions by countries in balance of payments difficulties.On the other hand, adherents of Views &quot; B &quot; and &quot; C &quot; consider that, what-ever the. United States reactions, we must keep full freedom in this matter, and could not agree to any time-table concerted with other nations involving steps for the removal of quantitative restrictions, even subject to such safeguards as are envisaged by &quot; View A.&quot;This is the reallv crucial difference between &quot; View A &quot;- on the one hand andViews &quot; B &quot; and &quot; G &quot; on the other.(iii) Tactics. Connected with the questions of substance at issue is aquestion of tactics vis-a-vis the United States,&quot; View A &quot; fears that any initiative coining from the United States willtake insufficient account of other countries&apos; difficulties and not go far enough in reducing the United States Tariff. In that event we should have either to agreeto an unsatisfactory scheme leading back to the difficulties of the inter-war period,or else to take up a purely negative attitude in resisting a United States initiative.For this.&quot;reason, the advocates of &quot; View A &quot; suggest that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should take the initiative on the lines already indicated.&quot; View B&quot; is not necessarily opposed to an initiative by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, but considers that the scope for such an initiative must be limited by our inability to pledge ourselves to steps which might be inconsistent with our balance of payments situation.View C &quot; holds that we should be content with having taken an initiativewith the Clearing Union and Buffer Stock proposals, and should leave any initiative-tive on commercial policy to the Americans. It might on this view be necessaryto take up a largely defensive and negative attitude towards United states proposals, so far as we can at- present judge what the nature of these proposals:is likely to be.
