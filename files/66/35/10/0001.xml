naval SITUATION.General Review.1. Concentrated U-boat attacks on convoys in the N. Atlantic have againcaused heavy shipping losses.Two U-boats have been sunk, another probably sunk and others possibly damaged.A German blockade runner has been sunk by U.S. warships in the south atlantic.Light craft have made a number of successful attacks on enemy shipping in Home Waters.A convoy from N. Russia has arrived in the United Kingdom.Home Waters.2.   Twenty ships of the convoy from N.. Russia have arrived.3. M.T.B.S supported by M.G.B.S torpedoed a large enemy ship offGravelines on the night of llth/T2th.On the 12th M.T.B.S 24, 35 and 38 attacked an enemy convoy off Dunkirkand torpedoed a large ship.Early on the 13th M.T.B.S 617, 624 and 628 attacked a convoy offTerschelling and sank two ships of 4,500 and 1,000 tons. Again on the night of the 15th/ 16th, M.T.B.S 88, 93 and 230 attacked an escorted enemy convoy;two ships were probably torpedoed. M.T.B. 93 was slightly damaged by gun-fire but there were no casualties.The&apos; Norwegian M.T.B.S 619 and 631 sank two enemy ships of 10,000 and3,000 tons off the Norwegian coast on the 14th. 631, whilst withdrawing, strucka rock and was lost, but all her crew was saved.4. Eddystone Lighthouse was bombed and machine-gunned on the 15th.Damage&quot;was done to the lens.Mediterranean.5.   H.M. Submarine Tigris is overdue and must be considered lost.6. H.M.S. Lightning (destroyer) was torpedoed and sunk by an E-boat offthe N. African coast on the night of the 12th.7. H.M. Destroyers Vanoc and Verity shot down one, and possibly another,of a force of enemy aircraft which attacked them while on escort duty off theTunisian coast on the 11th.H.M.S.

Derivent wasundamaged.M.T.Bs. attacked three E-boats in the Gulf of Tunis on the night of the12th/13th and left one on fire.8. Naval aircraft, in co-operation with the R.A.F., successfully attacked enemy shipping in the Sicilian channel. Details are given in the &quot; Air Situation.&quot;The average daily tonnage of material landed recently at Tripoli was,200 tons. This is about 1,000 tons in excess of the estimated average rate ofintake for the port when under Italian control. It is believed that, under Germancontrol, up to 4,000 tons was attained.South Atlantic.9. &apos; The German blockade runner Kota Nopan (7,322 tons) from the far east, was sunk by U.S. warships on the 10th, 400 miles W.N.W. of ascension island.  Prisoners were taken.Anti-Submarine Operations.10. Thirty-four U-boats were attacked during the week; 20 by aircraft and14 by surface craft. Two U-boats were sunk, one was probably sunk and three other attacks possibly caused damage on the 11th H.M.S. Harvester (destroyer), escorting a homeward-boundAtlantic convoy, forced a U-boat to the surface with depth charges and thenrammed her.   The Fighting French Aconit (corvette) also rammed the U-boat,
which sank. Prisoners were taken. Harvester, which was damaged and stopped,was later attacked and sunk by two torpedoes. At the same time A conit sighteda U-boat, which dived but was brought to the surface by depth charges, shelled,rammed and sunk.   Four prisoners were taken.On the same day a Liberator possibly damaged a U-boat in mid-Atlantic.A Hudson aircraft attacked a U-boat on the 12th south-west of the CanaryIslands, possibly causing damage.A Whitley aircraft possibly damaged a U-boat in the S.W. Approaches onthe 14th.A U-boat was probably sunk by U.S. aircraft 450 miles N.E. of Trinidad onthe 8th.Enemy Intelligence.German.11. The Tirpitz has left Trondheim. In addition to the three Narvik-classdestroyers at Bordeaux, another has been located at Le Havre.Italian.The volume of traffic to Tunisia remains approximately the same and isestimated to be about 12,000 tons during the week.Japanese.The port of Kavieng (New Ireland) has been developed as a fuelling base.There were 44 merchant ships, including eight tankers, at Rabaul on the 12th.U-boats.The U-boat situation in the North Atlantic continues to be serious. Themain concentration is in the central gap between the air cover available from newfoundland and Ireland (R), but activity is also apparent in the Caribbean,where four U-boats are operating.Italian U-boats have been unusually active and as many as six of the Atlanticforce of nine are at sea and widely dispersed. One of these sank the Empress ofCanada.Five U-boats are believed to be still off South Africa.It is estimated that, of the 110 U-boats operating in the Atlantic, more than half are concentrated on the North Atlantic convoy routes.Protection of Seaborne Trade.12. During the week ending the 14th/15th, 780 ships were convoyed. Ofthese 104 were in ocean convoys and 676 in British coastal convoys.Sixty-six destroyers (including 12 U.S. destroyers), 83 sloops, frigates and corvettes, two U.S. sea-plane tenders, one U.S. auxiliary aircraft carrier andone ocean boarding vessel were employed on escort duties.During the week ending the 13th, imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy totalled only 72,000 tons compared with 868,000 tons during theprevious seven days, and an average of 462,800 tons during the past ten weeks.Enemy Attack on Shipping: ? A13. U-boats torpedoed 32 ships during the week, of which 20 are knownto have sunk.Two homeward-bound. Atlantic convoys have been heavily attacked in mid-ocean, out of range of air cover until the 17th, when it was provided fromthe United Kingdom.   Weather conditions in Iceland (C) prevented flying.Eleven ships;were-torpedoed in one convoy; five of these have sunk. In theother, seven ships were torpedoed and of these six have been lost.An outward-bound convoy to West Africa lost four ships.In a U.S. convoy to North Africa one out of two ships torpedoed was sunk.A straggler from this convoy was also torpedoed.Three ships were torpedoed in a west-bound convoy off Algiers butreached port.Two ships, one a tanker, were sunk in a convoy to ports in the Caribbean.The Empress of Canada (21,517 tons) sailing independently from the Capeto the United Kingdom was torpedoed and sunk 600 miles S.S.E. of Freetown.[25176J &quot; ;&apos;: &apos; .   K

Surface craft laid mines off the Dutch coast. Aircraft laid mines inthe Baltic, off the German North Sea coast and off the Bay of Biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.15. On three nights of the week enemy aircraft were suspected of havinglaid mines off the Tees and the Tyne, in the Thames Estuary and off the coastbetween Dover and Beachy Head.E-boats may have laid mines one night off Orfordness.E-boat minelaying was suspected off Bone (Algeria).Eighteen moored mines have been destroyed during the week in home waters; off the East and South coasts seven ground mines were destroyed&apos;between the Humber and Newhaven. Six mines have been destroyed in the approaches to Bone.The mine totals are 4,223 ground and 2,299 moored.French Intelligence.16.. The condition of the warships at Toulon is believed to be as follows : ..., .      1 battleship almost submerged.2 battle cruisers extensively damaged.3 8&quot;-cruisers burnt out.; 1 8&quot;-cruiser sunk but probably salvable.1 6&quot;-cruiser burnt out.2 6&quot;-cruisers salvable.4 contre-torpilleursdestroyers Lrobably intact.6 or 7 submarines   r 1 J&apos;        4 escort vessels       JEnemy Merchant Shipping.Japanese. .. ;17. The rate of sinkings exceeds the estimated new construction by50,000 tons per month. The balance of shipping, after allowing for militaryoperational and essential import requirements is estimated to be 850,000 tons atthe end of February.French Shipping.18.. Eight more French ships of a total tonnage of 32,623 have arrived inthe United Kingdom from North Africa. They sailed in convoy and broughtcargoes of phosphates and iron ore. Seventeen French ships totalling 98,645 tonshave now reached this country.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing the operations in Russia is included as an inset.)The Russ6-German Campaign.General:19. Thaw conditions are slowing down the operations on the whole of thefront.Northern Sector.20. The German communique of the 13th claimed that the Russian attacks in the Staraya Russa area had been discontinued. The Russians, however, nowstate that attacks have been resumed.-Moscow Salient..21. ; The Russians have occupied Bely, Sichevka and Vyazma, and continueto follow up the German withdrawal. There is still no indication where theGermans intend to stabilise their line.
Orel-Kursk Sector.22. The Russian attacks in this sector have ceased, probably owing to thethaw. The Germans claim to be counter-attacking north-west of Kursk and tobe making some progress.Southern Sector.23. The German drive against Kharkov has resulted in the capture of thecity after bitter street fighting. The Germans have also captured Borisovka andGraivoron, and claim progress in the direction of Byelgorod, where the Russians,according to a German report, are counter-attacking. The Russians appear tobe withdrawing under cover of rear guards to the line of the Upper Donetz.24. Further south-eastwards, the Russians admit having withdrawn to theline of the Middle Donetz, and add that all German attempts to cross the riverhave failed. In the Chuguev area the Russians claim to have pressed back theenemy and repelled counter attacks after fierce fighting.Taman Bridgehead.25. The Russians have made slight progress in the northern part of theTaman Bridgehead, but thaw is preventing major operations, and may continueto do so until mid-April, when the country should be fit for operations:Meanwhile, German evacuation by sea and air is continuing.Summary.26. A week of operations largely governed by weather. On the Kharkovfront, the Germans, using powerful panzer forces, achieved considerable successagainst the Russians, who have been handicapped by the effects of the thaw ontheir extended communications. Mud conditions are likely to prevent theGermans making any immediate attempt to exploit their advance beyond theline of the Donetz. Meanwhile an improvement in communications may enablethe Russians to bring up and maintain adequate forces to make any suchexploitation impossible.Tunisia.First Army.27. The enemy continued to press his attacks west of Sedjenane during theweek without success, and our positions round Tamera remained intact. On the17th, however, he penetrated our positions and at the same time broke through a french position and attacked our Tamera position from the west. We lost some ground to the enemy.   Counter-attacks by both sides continued during the day^In the French Corps area our patrols have been active and have penetratedsome distance east of Ousseltia without encountering any appreciable opposition.Further south, offensive reconnaissances have been carried out towards Gafsa and enemy patrols were encountered west and north of the town. Early on the 17thU.S. forces began an advance on this front. They passed through Gafsa, whencethe Italian garrison withdrew, offering little resistance, but left all approachesheavily mined. Further east armoured forces occupied the station of Zannuchand pushed east, meeting so far only air and artillery opposition.Eighth Army,28. Since the enemy&apos;s unsuccessful attacks on the 6th against the high groundsouth of the Mareth-Medinine road, which cost him 52 German tanks and considerable infantry casualties, there has been little activity other than patrollingand shelling on both sides.On the 10th the enemy despatched a force of armoured cars and artilleryagainst the Fighting French west of the Matmata Hills. The Fighting Frenchwithdrew southwards, but were surrounded at Ksar Rhilane. Throughout theday they were subjected to heavy bombing and shelling. The R.A.F. providedstrong support making a heavy attack on the enemy and inflicting considerablecasualties in men and vehicles. On the 11th the enemy withdrew, leaving behindeighteen vehicles and seven guns.29. During the past fortnight the weather in Southern Tunisia has beendry, and the ground now offers- little obstacle to movement by A.F.Vs. and infantry. The Schotts, however, remain impassable, except for the causewaysrunning north-north-east and north-west from Kebili.[25176] b 2
Burma.Arakan.30. There has been no change on the Donbaik front, where active patrollingcontinues. In the Mayu Hills, the enemy is making small extensions northwards,but an attack on our positions from the west has been successfully held.To the east of the Mayu River the Japanese have been reinforced and activity has increased. Enemy movement in the hills to the north-east of Rathedaungnecessitated, our forming a defensive flank facing east, and during the night12th/13th the Japanese attacked the left of this position, causing our forward troops to withdraw according to plan. Counter-attacks are continuing but theyhave so far been unsuccessful. Further east in the Kaladan Valley our troops have withdrawn owing to an outflanking movement by the Japanese forces.Upper Burma. .31. Contrary to previous reports the Kachin levies are rallying well and areholding positions about 12 miles north of Sumprabum. On the 11th they engagedthe enemy in the Sumprabum area, inflicting casualties before returning to their positions.South-West Pacific.New Guinea.32. Australian patrols in the Mubo area have counted 237 enemy dead southof Mubo mainly due to air action.AIR SITUATION.General Review.33.   Bomber Command despatched strong forces against Stuttgart and Essen.There was a slight increase in attacks on the United Kingdom; at least 20 percent, of the raiders were destroyed.Effective attacks were made on enemy convoys in the Mediterranean and off&apos;New Guinea.United Kingdom.34. Seventy fighter-bombers flew overland in daylight, the main effort being a dawn attack on the Eastern &apos; London suburbs. At night, 65 long-range bombers operated, principally between the Tyne and Tees. During several raidssupplementary aircraft provided cover off-shore. Fighters shot down 21, probably destroyed three more and damaged 12, while a further six were brought down byA. A. gunfire.Germany and Occupied Territory.35. In the latter part of the week, both day and night operations were severely restricted by fog over this country.Day.36. U.S. Fortresses (B. 17) operated against the railway centres at Rouenand Amiens, which were attacked by 67 and 44 aircraft respectively. Both targetshave since been photographed and the damage assessment is included, inAppendix VI. From smaller-scale raids on alternative railway targets at Poixand Abbeville, no results were observed. Diversionary sweeps and cover to these operations were provided by 36 Liberators (B. 24) and 19 squadrons of - fighters;six. Spitfires are missing, and eight enemy fighters were destroyed, six probably destroyed and six damaged.The Cockerill Steel Works near Liege and railway workshops at Paderborn(40 miles east of Hamm) were attacked by 11 and 12 Mosquitoes respectively.At the former, hits were made on the marine engine sheds, foundries and a power station and, at the latter, on workshops and all three of the engine round houses.Two Mosquitoes were lost.Airfields at Maupertus, Drucat (near Abbeville) and St. Brieuc were bombed by escorted Whirlwinds and Venturas (B. 34),... and small-scale harassingoperations against enemy communications in Northern France resulted in damage to nine locomotives and one goods train. D
Night.37. Bomber Command aircraft operated against land targets on two nightsonly when strong forces attacked.Stuttgart and Essen.Of the 314 heavies despatched against Stuttgart, 267 attacked dropping769 tons of H.E. and incendiaries^ the former including 130 x 4,000 lbs. weather was good but ground haze, subsequently accentuated by smoke, hampered visualidentification. The target indicator markers were at first scattered, but a betterconcentration was achieved later in the attack when large fires developed into aconflagration which was visible from 150 miles.The attack on Essen was highly successful. About 1,025 tons of HE. andincendiaries were dropped by the 383 aircraft which attacked the target. Incloudless weather, the marker bombs were dropped around Krupps Works withgreat accuracy and, despite intense A.A. opposition, a highly concentrated attackresulted, nearly all crews reporting that they bombed with the markers in theirsights. There were two particularly impressive explosions and a third, accom-panied by a huge white flash, was observed by aircraft crossing the Dutch coast.Photographic reconnaissance made on the following day is referred to inAppendix VI.From the above operations, 34 bombers are missing and one crashed in thiscountry.Coastal Operations.38. Bomber Command aircraft of which 123 were despatched, laid 312sea-mines in enemy waters.   Three aircraft are missing.Typhoons damaged three armed trawlers and a coaster off the Dutch coast and Beaufighters destroyed an F.W. 200 west of the Bay of Biscay. Three enemy fighters were destroyed by Spitfires and Typhoons operating off the coasts of holland and France.Mediterranean.Tunisia.39. Numerous tactical reconnaissances, shipping escorts and anti-submarine patrols were flown. Fighter sweeps, most of which were uneventful, were alsocarried out but, on both sectors, dust storms, heavy rain and poor visibilityseriously hampered offensive operations.In the Northern Sector, escorted Fortresses (B. 17) started large fires along the dockside at Sousse and near a power plant and at an oil storage depot. bursts were also seen between the station and harbour. Over 100 tons of bombs were dropped in this attack. Medium bombers raided Enfidaville, where a supplydump was hit, and, at Tunis, bombs fell across the railway centre. Fighter-bombers operated against enemy troops in Sedjenane and attacked M.T. and communications nearby.In the Southern Sector, the main offensive effort was directed against enemy positions at Arram, Toujane and other objectives in the Mareth area; A.A. guns were silenced and attacks made on columns of M.T. whenever they could befound. The&apos; landing grounds at Mezzanine, where 12 enemy aircraft are believed to have been destroyed, and at Djebel Tebaga were raided. Bisleys bombed theroad and railway between Sfax and El Djem. On the 17th, support was providedfor U.S. and French troops in the Gafsa area&apos;.Enemy fighter-bombers damaged three Spitfires on Thelepte/Feriana airfieldbut, in doing so, five Me. 109s were shot down and four others damaged. Onthe 17th, one attack by Ju. 87s and five by fighter-bombers were made in theMedenine area; all the formations were escorted by large numbers of fighters.Sicilian Channel.40. Malta-based Beauforts and Naval Albacores carried out successfulnight attacks on strongly-escorted southbound convoys. A 6,000-ton ship,probably carrying ammunition, and a 600-ton schooner were sunk; torpedo-hits were made on two large tankers and at least three supply ships. Other promisingattacks on convoys were reported, though conditions prevented definite claims.Escorted convoys of Siebel ferries were bombed on three occasions in daylightby Marauders (B. 26), Mitchells (B. 25) and Fortresses (B. 17) respectively.Twenty-four of these barges were sighted and, of these, three or more are knownto have been sunk and about nine were severely damaged.
sSicily and Italy.41.   Halifaxes and Wellingtons despatched from the Western Desert to -attack shipping and harbour installations at Palermo dropped 80 tons of bombs;an effective smoke-screen, coupled with low cloud, prevented assessment of results:Cloud also obscured Naples when U.S. and R.A.F. Liberators (B. 24) dropped34 tons of bombs on the estimated position of the objective.Fighter-bombers from Malta, operating over Sicily, made successful raids on railway targets at Ragusa and on a factory near Pozzallo. Night &quot; intruders &quot;damaged two locomotives and set fire to a train on the western toe of Italy.Tripolitania.42. On the night of the 16th/17th, Tripoli (L) was attacked by 15 Ju. 88&apos;s;buildings (including barracks and a hospital) and M.T. were damaged and therewere some casualties.Russia,43. There are no indications of any intensive Russian activity on anyparticular sector during the week ended 16th March, but it is probable that theSoviet Air Force supported their land forces adequately along the whole front.The Russians twice raided the Finnish port of Katka, east of Helsinki.South of Lake Ilmen, the attacks by their troops appear to have had strong air support.The Russians claim to have successfully raided the German airfield nearOrel, destroying 15 enemy aircraft and damaging 20.Though there is little Russian air news from the Kharkov and Izyum sectors,the Germans reported considerable fighter opposition when they raided the airfield at Volchansk. In the Kuban, Russian aircraft carried out low-level attacks in theSlavyansk area - and, north-west of Troitskaya, on the Kuban river, a pontoonbridge was destroyed. The ports of Taman and Anapa were raided constantlyand heavy casualties were inflicted. The Russians claim to have destroyed cuttersand barges on the Kerch Straits and to have supported their bridgehead atNovorossisk with attacks on German positions there.German air operations appear to have been concentrated in support of their attck on Kharkov, during which a heavy scale of effort is thought to have been maintained. There are also reports of some activity in the Black Sea and Crimeaareas; on the remaining sectors, enemy operations continue to be relatively small.In the far north, light scale attacks on Murmansk have taken place, with little effect.Burma.44. U.S. medium and heavy bombers made seven attacks on importantbridges. The viaduct at Gokteik (60 miles N.E. of Mandalay) and the northernapproach to the bridge at Myitnge were both hit twice, and &quot;five hits were madeon the north end of the Pazundoung bridge at Rangoon.   &quot;In the Rathedaung area about 170 Blenheims and Hurricanes attacked enemy positions in support of our land forces. In these operations and in inter-ception of two enemy attacks on Maungdaw (58 miles N.N.W. of Akyab) three enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of two Blenheims and four Hurricanes.In Central Burma, river craft on the Irrawaddy and Chindwin rivers andthe railway station at Wuntho were attacked, and in Northern Burma U.S.Kittyhawks (P. 40) damaged a railway bridge at Mogaung and attacked enemy positions at Sumprabum and Hkalak Ga.In- Southern Burma four U.S. Liberators (B. 24) attacked the airfield atMingaladon (Rangoon); the runways and buildings were hit and, in combat, three enemy fighters were destroyed. U.S. Liberators (B. 24) also bombed the dock area at Moulmein.Night attacks were made on. Akyab, Mandalay, Bhamo, Thazi and the airfield at Toungoo; at Mandalay bombs from Wellingtons hit the railway yards and the station area and, at Bhamo (E. of Katha), several large fires were started on the waterfront.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.45. An enemy convoy consisting of five merchantmen and three destroyerswas attacked off Wewak by seven U.S. Fortresses (B.17). One 8,000-ton ship and a destroyer were hit, one ship was seen to explode, and a 4,000-ton tankeris believed to have been sunk.
U.S. Bostons (A.20) made two attacks on Salamao; a large quantity of.fuel oil is believed to have been destroyed.Beaufighters and U.S. Bostons (A.20) made three attacks on enemy positions in the Mubo area.U.S. medium bombers attacked the town area of Lae, and TJ.S. heavy bombersmade two small-scale night raids on the airfield at Wewak.. A total of 40 enemy bombers and fighters attacked the airfield near Dobodura(Buna area) where two aircraft on the ground, were destroyed. U.S. fightersintercepted the attacking force and destroyed, nine fighters and probably destroyed,a further five aircraft for the loss of one U.S. Lightning (P.38). The dock area at Oro Bay (160 miles S.E. of Lae) was damaged as a result of an attack by15 enemy aircraft.New Britain.46.

Japanese positions at Kiska were attacked by U.S. aircraft on the 9th,13th and 14th.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.52. Raids by enemy aircraft occurred on four days and six nights of theperiod under review. Outstanding features were attacks on Hastings and onthe Eastern suburbs of London by day and on a number of important industrial areas extending from Tees-side to Tyneside on three nights early in the week.The only material effect on production was caused on Tees-side where adirect hit on an electricity sub-station at Thornaby affected temporarily fourfactories in the district. L.N.E. Railway system was also dislocated at severalpoints. Elsewhere damage was mainly confined to house property which,however, suffered considerably.By Day.53. On the 11th, at Hastings, considerable damage was done to houses andshops, the East Sussex Hospital was affected by blast and the railway toSt. Leonards blocked; 36 persons were killed and 55 seriously injured.On the 12th, shortly after dawn, Ilford and Barking suffered considerable damage, fires were started, telecommunications and transport services weredislocated.

Auxiliary Vessels and to Naval Personnel.March 11.-M.G.B. 114 damaged.March 14. Trawler Moravia sunk, probably by mine, off Orfordness.March -15. Rescue Tug shortage grounded and later sank off N.W. Iceland (C).March 16. ^Trawler Campobello was disabled in mid-Atlantic and abandoned in a sinking condition.The following casualties to naval personnel have been reported : Officers: 2 killed; 1 wounded; 17 missing.Ratings :  34 killed;. 10 wounded; 122 missing; 5 previously, reported missing are known to be prisoners of war.APPENDIX YI.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the past week : Germany.Essen.Photographs covering the whole of Krupps&apos; works and most of the townwere taken on the day after the second attack on the 12th/13th March. Animmediate interpretation shows that the greater part of the damage has been caused to the Krupps works, where large fires were still burning at the time of
photography. Some 34 further shops are damaged, 13 of them seriously. the rolling-stock shop has been totally, and the locomotive works partly, destroyedby fire, while press shops, repair shops, machine shops and foundries have allsuffered more or less severe damage. Two collieries and a zinc works have also-been damaged.In the town area, damage is centred in the Borbeck district, where manyhutted camps, houses and industrial buildings have been affected.Munich.An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the 11th March,covering most of the town and suburbs, shows many heavy H.E. incidents and considerable damage by fire in the central, north-western, western and northerndistricts. Some of these fires were still smoking at the time of photography, thesecond day after the attack.Factories damaged include the Rathgeber wagon works, the Bavarian motorworks, Kraus and Co. (locomotives, armoured cars, &amp;c), and Vorderstamm andSeitz (aluminium and silium foundry).. /The railway marshalling yard in north-east Munich, the town gasworks, the-Maximilian and the Pioneer barracks, and two warehouses have been damaged.Other public buildings have also been hit. Amongst these latter is the famousBrown House, which has been severely damaged by fire.Berlin.Further reports of the results of the. attack on the 1st/2nd! March nowshow :- .(i)? That the damage in the centre of the city, particularly in the Unter denLinden, is more serious than was at first thought. In the FriedridhStrasse (comparable to Oxford Street in London) 45 bomb craters werecounted. The Leipziger Strasse (comparable to the Strand in London)was particularly affected, severe damage being caused to the well-known Wertheims Store (comparable to Self ridges),(ii) On the morning after the attack it was known in the German AirMinistry that 1,000 persons had been killed (a figure which might wellincrease later and has only been exceeded on two occasions in thiscountry).(iii) The destructive effect of our heavy bombs caused a tremendous impres-sion. In previous attacks persons had felt fairly safe save for adirect hit, but now they know that a bomb can fall a long way off and still cause death and destruction.France.Rennes.A detailed interpretation by a railway expert of photographs taken on the8th March confirms the success of the attack. The marshalling yard sufferedextensively and was rendered completely unworkable, while every track at thehump end in the sortings sidings was put out of use. The goods yard, the wagonrepair sidings and the goods depot v/ere all severely damaged.As a result of this attack all traffic working throughout this railway centre,the most important in Brittany, was stopped. The time necessary to put thefacilities into working order again will depend on the available supply of labourand material, but, in view of the large number of rails and points destroyed, itis.likely that some considerable time will elapse. The effects of the attack willhave been felt all along the line and traffic for the Brittany peninsula inparticular must have been seriously delayed.Photographs taken on the 15th March show that the Naval Stores Depot hasbeen further damaged, this time in the south-western part. Five small buildings have been destroyed and many others damaged.A ground source reports that during this attack a train in Pennes Station,,which photographs confirm, suffered considerable damage, was partly wrecked and about 80 Germans killed.
