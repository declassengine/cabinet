THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY\S GOVERNMENT;&apos;WAR CABINET I 20COPY NO. 33SECRET.WP (U3) 10k9 th march.  19*0.CIVIL REQUIREMENTS FOR THEMIDDLE EAST.NOTE BY THE MINISTER OF WAR transport.      As a result of the shipping cuts imposed in January of this year,the number of ships serving the Eastern Theatres from the UnitedKingdom and North America was fixed at a monthly total of 1+0.     Ofthe 27 ships sailing in March from North America, 11+ are allocated toserve the Red Sea area.2.      The date on which the cut was imposed made it impossible asregards January to decide the incidence of the cut as between civil and military requirements on anything but an ad hoc basis;    as regardsFebruary and March, it was left to the Minister of State to agreewith the Commander-&apos;in-Chief, Middle East,  in what proportions the cutshould be borne.      In fact, it was shared proportionately.3.      The Minister of State in his telegram No. 513 Prisec^stressesthe extreme gravity of the situation which will arise if the civilprogramme is continued at its present level.      In this connection itshould be noted that the directive under which shipping serving theEastern Theatres was cut gave the change in the military situation asthe reason justifying the withdrawal of shipping from these areas.The Minister of State said that the civil programme would notbear a cut of such severity for any length of time.U*      I have set out in the note attached what, in my view, theMiddle East minimum civil programme should be for April and subsequent months.        I have provided for meeting the Minister ofState&apos;s request in Cairo telegram No. 513 Prisec, for 10,000 tons ofnitrates monthly, and I suggest that it would be proper to include in it provision for 10,000 tons a month of cereals to offset the deliveries by sea to Turkey up to&quot;&apos;a total of 50,000 tons.      Thepolitical arguments in favour of supplying these cereals are very strong, and the Minister of State has made it clear that he cannotmeet this requirement except on a replacement basis.5,      The Minister of State&apos;s plea for help can be met by:-(a) securing for civilian requirements a higher proportion ofthe space at present available.(b) increasing the amount of shipping serving the Red Sea area.(c) a combination of (a) and (b).6,      The Minister of State&apos;s position is one of hardship in that:(a) Out of his 20,000 tons of imported cereals he has to findno less than 8,000 monthly for the fighting services(b) Shipments have so far this year fallen well below the20,000 tons monthly average(c) He has had to meet since mid-November exceptionally heavyshipments to Malta, involving some 70,000 &quot;tons of foodstuffs

(d) Owing to the immediate threat of famine on the Persian supplyline to Russia he has had to forgo two cargoes destined forthe Red Sea(e) He is now being pressed to release substantial quantities ofv       cereals for. turkey and   (f) the success of the negotiations with the Egyptian governmentfor the release of urgently wanted cereals and rice, which arenow coming forward for export to other Middle East countries and Ceylon, depend on an assured supplying of some 10,000 tonsof nitrates monthly for six months.There is, therefore, a case for directing that the minimum cerealand nitrate requirements of the Red Sea area should be met as a first charge on the shipping available, even if military programmes are affected.      An approach has been made through the Chiefs of Staff tosecure Ik additional American-controlled ships monthly for the Red sea in April,, May and June, without loss to the U.K.  import programme.Should these vessels be found the difficulty of meeting the Ministerof State&apos;s.....requirements &quot;would be much reduced.7,      I therefore ask the War Cabinet;(a) to direct that the loading of 30,000 tons of cereals and10,000 tons of nitrate monthly for the Middle East shouldrank as a first charge on cargo shipping space to that area,even if military programmes are affected.(b) to invite the Minister of State to make available for delivery by sea to Turkey 10,000 tons of cereals monthly upto a total of 50,000 tons to be lifted by the Turks, inaddition to such barley as he is able to provide for deliveryby rail from Iraq.MINISTRY OF WAR TRANSPORT.9TH MARCH. 19U3.2 -
