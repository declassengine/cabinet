THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  April 1943.&quot;ASECRET.Copy No.W.P. (43) 132.April 1, 1943.WAR CABINET.TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (INTERIM DEVELOPMENT) BILL.THE objects of this Bill are (a) to extend planning control throughout England, and Wales; and(b) to strengthen control over interim development while planning schemes are being prepared.The Legislation Committee have considered the terms of the Bill, and aresatisfied that it is aptly drawn to secure those objects. They have, however,reserved for decision by higher authority two questions of policy : (i) Is it expedient to proceed with planning legislation by stages, beginning with this limited measure, or would it be preferable to wait until it is possible to introduce comprehensive legislation making radical changes in the system of planning ?(ii) If legislation is to be introduced amending the Town and country planning Acts, should not this opportunity be taken of confining the planning functions of local authorities to the councils of counties and county boroughs ?2. The main arguments on each of these two questions have been devolped in memoranda circulated by the Minister of Town and Country Planning(W.P. (43) 111) and the Home Secretary (W.P. (43) 117); and a preliminary discussion of the issues involved has been held in the Lord President&apos;s Committee(L.P. (43) 19th Meeting, Minute 2).In the course of this discussion the Mi nister of Town and Country Planning-pointed out that the present Bill was designed to fit into the structure of the,existing Town and Country Planning Acts; and represented that it would beimpossible, for technical reasons, to graft. on to this Bill proposals forredistributing the planning functions of local authorities under those Acts. Ifthis view is accepted, the two questions of policy raised by the legislation committee in fact merge into one -Is it expedient, when radical changes in the system of planning havebeen foreshadowed, to introduce a Bill which is limited to strengthening thecontrol of interim development under the existing system and cannot make provision for transferring the planning functions of local authorities to the council&apos;s of counties and county boroughs?3.   The main arguments in favour of proceeding with this legislation are; (a) It will be some time before legislation for the comprehensive,reform ofthe planning system can be passed. Meanwhile, rights are being acquired which may seriously prejudice the future working of thenew system, when it comes into force. Control over interim develdp-ment needs to be strengthened in order to prevent the position from being further prejudiced.(b) Local authorities are anxious to have these further powers for thispurpose.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.[25233]
(c) The early introduction of legislation for this purpose has been promisedin statements made with the authority of the Government at intervalssince July 1941 cf. the statements made in the House of Lords bvLord Reith on the 17th July, 1941 (Official Report, col. 853), by LordPortal on the 18th November, 1942 (Official Report, col. 105), and byLord Snell on the 23rd February, 1943 (Official Report, col. 221). Onthe other hand, the language used by the Minister without &quot;Portfolioin moving the Second Reading of the Minister of Town andGouhtriyPlanning Bill on the 26th January, 1943 (Official Report,, cols. 41%-420), did not contemplate separate legislation on this subject inadvance of more general legislation strengthening the powers of thenew Minister.4.   The main considerations on the other side are : (a) If this Bill had been introduced some time ago, when it was first fore-shadowed, it would no doubt have been accepted as a necessary interim measure to prevent the position being prejudiced while larger schemes were, being worked out; but, now that the Scott and Uthwatt reports have been under consideration for some time, it would cause generaldisappointment if the first Bill introduced by, the new Minister of town and Country Planning made no appreciable advance towardsthe larger reforms recommended in those Reports. ,        - - &apos;; &quot;:(b) The changes proposed by this Bill, though limited, are likely to becontested by some of the interests affected.    If there is  to beParliamentary controversy on this subject, there is much to be said for-   facing it on a larger Bill, which, when passed, would effect substantial1        .      reforms. ; ;- (c) There is a strong case for removing planning from the jurisdiction: ofthe councils of county districts. The countryside should be planned in relation to wider areas; and, further, these smaller authorities have,&quot; not the expert staff required for the proper exercise of planningpowers. The introduction at this stage of a Bilk strengthening thepowers of the existing planning authorities might be understood asconfirming the present distribution of planning functions among localauthorities and indicating that the Government have no desire totransfer these powers to the larger authorities even when more radical changes are&apos;made in the present system of planning.5. The Minister of Town and Country Planning, while recognising thatcriticism on these lines is likely and that it may give rise to political difficulties,still thinks it necessary for practical reasons to proceed with a Bill which is needed to enable local authorities to prevent the future being prejudiced by uncontrolleddevelopment in the transitional period. &apos;The members of the Lord Presidents Committee were impressed byj the considerations urged by the Minister; and, while the Home Secretary reserved his/position, the majority took the view that the balance of advantage lay On the sideof proceeding with this Bill. They thought it essential, however^ that means should be found of making it clear that the Government were not, by introducing legislation strengthening the powers of the existing planning authorities,prejudging in any way the question whether the functions of local authorities under a reformed scheme of town and country planning should&apos;be distributed as atpresent or transferred to the larger authorities.The Committee felt that this point might be met if, on moving the SecondReading of the Bill, the Minister made it clear that, although it was necessaryfor the purpose of this interim measure to make use of the existing local machineryfor planning, this must not be taken to mean that the Government had rejected thearguments in favour of the view that the planning functions of local authoritiesshould be.entrusted to the larger units of local government administration. -Thisquestion would have to be considered in relation to the proposals now underconsideration for radical reform of the planning system; and the Governmentwould not allow their future consideration&apos; of that question to be influenced by thefact that the present Bill had necessarily to make use of the existing machineryfor planning&apos;. &apos;       &apos; &apos; . ;&apos; .   - &quot;Great George Street, S.W.1,   . -^a..;       ixiV;mt %nunl ^&apos;
