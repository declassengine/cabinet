THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S ^GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1943.SECRET. / Copy No.W.P. (43) 131.March 29, 1943.WAR CABINET.POLICY IN BURMA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Burma.IN his Memorandum which I submitted .on the 7th August, 1942(W.P. (42) 346), the Governor made certain suggestions for policy in Burmaduring the reconstruction period after our re-occupation of the country. these suggestions were further explained by Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith at the meetingof the War Cabinet on the 12th August (W.M. (42) 111th Conclusions, Minute 3),and on his return to India he set up an organisation which is studying and planning the tasks of reconstruction in all departments of the administration.Need of a basis for political warfare.2. Meanwhile, it is a matter of some urgency to reach decisions in principle on certain of the questions of policy which he submitted. It is clearly a factor of some importance for the success of military operations that our preliminarypropaganda towards Burma should be effective. Everything possible is being donein this direction, but in the absence of a positive policy our political warfare is necessarily confined to anti-Japanese themes, the falsity of Japanese promisesand our own confidence in ultimate victory, and cannot proceed to definitestatements of our benevolent intentions towards the Burmese when once, withtheir assistance, we have freed them from the enemy. But it is precisely bypositive and definite statements of what we have in mind for Burma that we can best appeal to the Burmese and induce their active co-operation. This is the moreimportant since the Japanese, by setting up a puppet administration and byTojo&apos;s promise of independence within the year, are doing their best to play upto Burmese aspirations.Questions on which decisions are therefore desirable.   %3. It is essential, therefore, that those in charge of our political warfareshould have a framework of guidance on policy within the limits of which theycan operate. In order to provide the necessary guidance decisions are required on the following questions : (a) the terms of a general statement of His Majesty&apos;s Government^ eventualpolicy of self-government for Burma;(b) our intention to repair material damage and to reconstruct the economicand social life of Burma, with such assistance from His Majesty&apos;sGovernment as is required and possible.(c) the control which will continue to be exercised by His Majesty5s Govern-ment during the interim period (after the conclusion of the military, phase of reoccupation) while restoration and reconstruction are still proceeding with our assistance; and the length of such period;(d) the steps to be taken during this period to prepare the ground for thetransfer of responsibility to Burmans under a fully self-governingconstitution.[25229] B
Other reasons for desiring decisions.4. Decisions on these questions. are also desirable for the following reasons : (i) Publicity in America. ^The Japanese invasion aroused lively Americaninterest in Burma, and this gave rise to additional criticisms of British&quot;imperialism&quot; and &quot;Colonial&quot; administration. We have a good case, and in the interests of Anglo-American relations should makethe most of it when Burma comes into the news again. I suggestthat we shall make the right sort of appeal to American public opinionif our policy is based on the principles that we mean to establish full self-government as early as possible, and, in order that it may be ableto function, to restore first the devastation caused by the japanese occupation and military operations, retaining a temporary control for this purpose with the advice of representative Burmans.(ii) Administrative Planning. The officers who are planning reconstruction and reforms in order to equip Burma for full self-government shouldbe given some idea of the period for v. hich they will be free to carryout these plans and of the principles on which financial assistance can reasonably be expected. The scope of their plans must largely dependon these factors. They also affect the willingness of the Europeanbusiness firms to make plans for restarting their enterprises in Burma,on which the country&apos;s economy has largely depended in the past,and the resumption of which will probably be essential in the early&apos;- stages of reconstruction.Suggested Policy.Interim period of assisted restoration in preparation for full self-government within the Empire.5. The policy which I think we should adopt is in essence that suggestedby Sir R. Dorman-Smith in his memorandum. Our object is to establish full self-government as soon as possible. But we have a moral obligation first to restore the economic, social and political foundations of Burma&apos;s life, as it wouldbe a mockery to hand over the country in a ruined condition to Burmans for self-government by them as soon as we have re-occupied it.6. Moreover, in the interests of the further prosecution of the war against japan, it will be essential that Burma should be a secure base for sending war supplies to China and for any further operations. These purposes will requireboth (a) the repair of material damage caused by enemy invasion and occupation,our scorched-earth policy and present and future air and ground operations, and(b) the maintenance of order and security a difficult task which can only be accom-plished by restoring the economic life of the population with a view to promotingtheir tranquillity and contentment.It should therefore be the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, to the extent that their own resources make possible, to give financial assistance for approvedprojects of reconstruction which are beyond the resources of Burma. In theprocess of reconstruction we should also take the opportunity for any necessaryimprovements and reforms in administration.Regime during interim period.7. A certain -amount of - preliminary reconstruction will necessarily beeffected for immediate military purposes during the military phase of re-occupation, when the G.O.C. will have undivided responsibility for the wholeadministration. When this phase is concluded, the main work of reconstruction and of completing the restoration of normal and stable conditions will fall on thecivil government. But this task would be totally beyond the capacity of the burmese under the old constitution, and for this reason and also because HisMajesty&apos;s Government will be providing funds, it is essential that they should retain control through the Governor during a limited period. I have carefully considered with Sir.E. Dorman-Smith the suggestion made that, in order toavoid any misunderstanding that we are going back on our pledges, the powers
of government during this interim period should be entrusted to a smallCommission which could include Burmans. I am convinced, however, that anything on the analogy of the Newfoundland system (in which the Governormerely presides over a Commission of Government the decisions of which in thelast resort go by a majority) would be unworkable in the special conditions of burma and in the situation brought about by the war and the Japanese invasion.Burmese themselves would very probably be reluctant to take responsibilities, andin any case it will be essential to avoid any division of authority or responsibilityduring that difficult period, in-order that, when necessary, firm decisions may betaken without hesitation or delay. The Governor should, however, appoint a body, or bodies, of representative Burmans to assist him in an advisory capacity.This system would in effect be similar to that which obtained during the later stages of the invasion, when Ministers, while remaining with him to advise him,themselves asked the Governor to take over their responsibilities in additon tohis own. Sir R. Dorman-Smith is advised by his two Burmese ex-Ministers andother Burmese who are with him in India that the Burmese public would quiteappreciate the necessity of such a period of &quot;direct rule&quot; for purposes of reconstruction.Length of interim period.8. As regards a suitable length for this interim period it should be long enough to enable us to make sure of the restoration of stable conditions and get the execution of plans for reconstruction Well under weigh, but it shouldnot be so long as to defer unduly Burmese hopes of self-government. TheGovernor consulted his officers who are engaged in reconstruction planning andalso his Burmese advisers, referred to above, on this question.. The formersuggested that ten years after the end of hostilities with Japan is the shortestperiod for carrying out their plans; the latter, while quite agreeing as to thenecessity of a considerable period of direct rule, thought that seven years shouldbe its maximum if Burmese goodwill is to be retained. Sir R. Dorman-Smithagrees with the latter view, the seven years reckoning from the date of the generalre-establishment of civil Government.9. I should mention here that the heads of the European firms -frith whom have been in touch in regard to reconstruction problems and have spoken of a,five-year plan as an illustration have recently represented to me their view thatit would be inadvisable to fix any specific time for an interim period leading to full self-government. They have advanced the view that even ten years wouldbe too short for- reconstruction in the widest sense, i.e., including the remedyingof past defects and educating and training Burmese in the practice of good government, and that consequently it would be better to name no period since they recognise that the prospect of one so long as they postulate would cause a sense of hopelessness and frustration in the Burmese mind that would militate againstharmony and security. I have carefully considered these representations inconsultation with the Governor, but we have both reached the conclusion that theadvantages of giving a definite time-limit, to which all can work, greatlyoutweigh the risk of making an over-sanguine estimate of the time required; andthat the period should be fixed at seven years (which, however, will not begin to run till civil government is restored in Burma, which may not be for two or&quot;more years-hence) as the maximum for which we can hope for the willing, and, ifpossible, enthusiastic, co-operation of the Burmese, which is so important for thesuccess of our plans. If, even in seven years, we were unable owing to chronicdisorder or some unforeseen event to achieve our purpose, we should naturallyhave to revise our policy, and should be justified in doing so by the fact thatunforeseen conditions Iliad supervened. Moreover, I should contemplate that (Burma&apos;s new Constitution at the end of the seven-year period would, be accom- /panied by provisions perhaps in the form of a Treaty which should in any case /secure to us the power to fulfil our continuing obligations for Burma&apos;s defence jand for safeguarding the backward and non-Burmese elements in her population/and important minorities; and could, if necessary, be so widely drawn as to give&apos;us such further rights as might be considered essential when the time came,Apart from that, we may expect that we should still be able to guide and influence the policy of the new Burmese Government if self-government is inaugurated iran atmosphere of goodwill. i10.   During the latter part of the seven-year period it will be desirable toset machinery in motion for devising a new Constitution providing whatever form[25229] &quot; -  &apos;     B 2
of government Burmans themselves consider most likely to conduce to the prosperity of their country and the well-being of their people. But during thecommencement of the reconstruction period the Government of Burma shouldnot enter upon formal discussions in regard to the making of the future Constitu-tion, as this would stimulate party jockeying and undesirable political agitationwhich would greatly hinder the work of reconstruction and the restoration of order and stable conditions. There should, however, be informal talks with allschools of political thought, and constructive study of the constitutional problemamong Burmese themselves should be encouraged and guided with a view topreparing the ground for the actual work of constitution-making when the time comes.As a result, therefore, of the full discussions of this question which have takenplace, the Governor and I agree that the best programme would be a period of seven years&apos; control by His Majesty&apos;s Government, during the first part of whichthe energies of the administration should be entirely devoted to reconstruction andrestoration of stability, while during say the last two years of the period though there is no need to be precise about this now definite steps would be taken todetermine and give effect to the processes of consti tution-making and transferring-responsibility to Burman hands.Training of Burman recruits for services.11. There is another step which might usefully be taken during the periodof controlled reconstruction. When we get back to Burma the Services will be seriously understaffed; some of the Burmese staff already in them will have diedor become unemployable, and education will have been at a standstill so that itwill be several years before new local recruits are available. The Governor,therefore, recommends that two or three batches, each consisting of twenty orthirty young Burmans, should be sent for training to universities in this country or other parts of the Empire. This would achieve the three-fold object ofproviding the best possible training, imparting to the rising Burmese generation abroad and British outlook, including British ideals of good government and administration, and confirming by concrete evidence the sincerity of our intentionto transfer the administration to Burman hands as soon as possible.His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s financial aid.12. As regards financial assistance I recognise of course that it isimpossible for various reasons to make any estimate of what would be requiredor could be made available. I trust, however, that it can be agreed in principlethat His Majesty&apos;s Government will assume an obligation to supply generous aidin setting Burma economically on her feet after the losses which she will have suffered as an outpost in the war between the British Empire and Japan. Suchaid will be necessary to restore her usefulness as a base for the furtherance of our operations against Japan. Moreover, without it, it will not be possible at a reasonably early date to restore the conditions of stability and contentmentrequisite for the success of the policy of self-government to which we are pledged.I suggest also that it is a British interest, materially as well as morally, togive this assistance in order to help Burma to become an asset instead of a liability to the British Commonwealth, and because such assistance, which wouldlargely take the form of the export as soon as, and to the extent that, they cianbe spared of capital equipment and to some extent consumption goods, willmake a contribution towards the expansion of production and maintenance ofemployment in this country and restore Burma&apos;s position as a market and a source of supply. Similarly the resumption by British firms of their businessesin Burma, besides being essential to the latter&apos;s immediate rehabilitation, shouldhave an effect on this country&apos;s balance of payments which may not be altogethernegligible at a time when we shall have lost so much of our Indian investment.So far as the restoration of material damage is concerned, the principle offinancial assistance is I think implicit in a statement,*&apos; which has already beenmade to various companies which have suffered war damage, that with a view tothe well-being of the people and the resumption of productive activity-/HisMajesty&apos;s Government will be ready to give what assistance they can (in* This statement, which covers the Colonial Empire and Burma, was authorised as a resultof consultations between the Treasury, Colonial Office and Burma Office, and has been made to various persons interested, and to a Joint Committee representing trading interests in the british territories occupied by Japau.
conjunction with such common fund or organisation as may be established inter-nationally) for the restoration of destruction or damage of property and goodsso far as this is beyond Burma&apos; s resources^! This statement was made withreference to privately-owned property and goods, and the governing principle,which I have italicised above, clearly applies with greater force to public utilities and undertakings such as docks, roads, railways, hospitals, schools andpublic buildings. Moreover, in the case of Burma the need for much materialreconstruction both of public and private property will arise at once as a war-need for the purpose of facilitating the further prosecution of the war against japan. Besides material reconstruction it will evidently be necessary, for therestoration of the social and economic life of the country for both war and post-war purposes, to re-establish essential services for public health, education,agriculture and so on. His Majesty&apos;s Government are already standing behind the Government of Burma financially in regard to their current expenditure and this, no doubt, will continue so far as the provision of such services isconcerned until Burma can stand on her own feet. The opportunity would betaken for remedying past faults in the administration and effecting, with due regard to efficiency and economy, such improvements as are not costly and areevidently worth while when we are engaged in rebuilding from new foundations.13. The total bill for Burma&apos;s reconstruction is not likely, judged by ourstandards, to be a heavy one, though relatively far beyond her own immediateresources. She has existed in the past on a very simple agricultural economy and I have no doubt will in the main continue to do so. To give some idea of the proportionate scale of what might be required I may mention that before thewar with Japan her total budget (including defence) was 16-1 crores of rupees,or  12,375,000 (budget estimate 1940-41). Care, however, would in all cases be taken to avoid impracticable or spendthrift policies, and any importantprojects would, of course, be submitted for the prior approval of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the latter would have a local representative to supervise expendi-ture. Nor do I think that His Majesty&apos;s Government could necessarily beexpected to finance large schemes, which may be desirable, such as one for thepurchase of agricultural land from non-agricultural holders, and which, might,if they are adopted, have to be financed by borrowing.Basis for British propaganda towards Burma.14. The most immediate purpose for which decisions of policy are required on the questions stated above is in order to provide a basis and direction for political warfare and propaganda towards Burma. I have suggested the policywhich I think should be adopted, on these questions both on its own merits andas the best basis for successful political warfare. I should like to add a wordas to the procedure I have in mind if my suggestions find favour with the WarCabinet. Eventually, no doubt, we should make a formal announcement of our intentions towards Burma, but the correct timing for such an announcement(whether, for example, at an appropriate stage in the campaign, or on resumptionof civil responsibility by the Governor) must be a matter for future consideration.Preliminary propaganda of a positive kind is, however, already needed and theneed for it will progressively increase. To be effective our propaganda shouldbe as definite as possible, but the best technique will probably be to proceedgradually from general to more definite statements, so as to diminish the risk ofstaleness; and to pull the whole series together in a comprehensive and authoritative-tive announcement at the selected time. It is too early to decide the precise terms of such an eventual announcement, and anything drafted now might well&quot;need to.be reconsidered in the light of intervening events before the time camefor making it. I have, however, drawn up the annexed skeleton of a draft announcement to show the framework within the limits of which our political warfare would be conducted. It should be clearly understood that there is noquestion in my mind at present of making a public announcement of this compre-hensiye kind, but if the Cabinet approves my proposals, this skeleton ivouldprovide material for propagandist themes to be used cautiously, gradually and insuch manner as may be decided in consultation with the experts in political warfare. . .On this understanding, the -skeleton draft announcement is, I think, self-explanatory. Paragraph 1 merely restates what is implicit in public statementsthat have already been made. As regards paragraphs 4 and 5, it will bedesirable to give these indications of the time programme (on these points, as on
others, the draft would be subject to reconsideration in the light of events beforethe announcement were made) in order that the Burmese may be reassured andall concerned may know where they stand. As regards the second part of the interim period, it is, of course, unnecessary to commit ourselves now to anyparticular method of constitution-making. That can be decided when we arehearer the time and after the Governor has had the opportunity of takingsoundings in Burma. But, as I have said, I have no doubt that, in connectionwith the process of framing a Constitution (whether this was done through a constituent body or by other means), provision would be made for securing thefuture defence of Burma and the fulfilment of His Majesty&apos;s Governments other obligations towards her, including safeguards for certain backward and non-Burmese elements in her population and for important minorities.Summary of Conclusions.15.   My suggestions may be summarised as follows : (1) In order to give a basis and direction to our political warfare towardsBurma in preparation for future operations, it is desirable to reach decisions in principle as to .   .       .(a) the nature of the regime for an interim period after the resump-tion of civil government, for the purpose of reconstruction andpreparing the country for full self-government within theEmpire;(b) the assistance to be given in reconstruction.Such decisions are also desirable for the sake of our publicity inAmerica and to facilitate reconstruction planning.(2) Assistance in reconstruction and in the restoration of stable and normalconditions is desirable as a war measure in order to make Burma a secure base for the passage of war supplies to China and for the furtherance of other war measures against the Japanese.(3) Such assistance will also be desirable with a view to equipping Burma as early as possible for full self-government.(4) It should therefore be the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, so far as their own resources make it possible, to give financial assistance forapproved projects which are beyond Burma&apos;s own resources formaterial reconstruction and the establishment of adequate technical and administrative services.(5) Educational facilities in the British Empire should be provided for young Burmans with a view to obtaining recruits for the public services.(6) During the interim period the administration should be controlled by HisMajesty&apos;s Government through the Governor, who should appointrepresentative Burmans to assist him in an advisory capacity.(7) A limit of seven years should be fixed for the interim period. Duringthe latter part of it steps should be taken for framing a newConstitution and preparing for the transfer of responsibility toBurmans.(8) If these suggestions are adopted we shall have a basis for effective propa-ganda towards the Burmese on the themes (to be used as occasionmakes appropriate), (a) that it is our policy to enable Burma to takeher place as a self-governing member of the British Commonwealthalong with the United Kingdom and Dominions; (b) that in order tomake this possible we first mean to assist her in reconstruction and therestoration of normal conditions; (c) with a view to this His Majesty&apos;sGovernment must retain control (for an interim period of not morethan seven years) through the Governor in consultation with Burmanopinion; (d) all efforts must, to start with, be concentrated on the urgent tasks of reconstruction and beating the Japanese. When these have been accomplished, attention can be given to the question of framing a new Constitution.L. S. A.Burma Office, March 29, 1943.
ANNEX.Skeleton and provisianal draft for a possible eventual announcement.1. IT is the settled policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to enable Burma totake her place as a self-governing member of the British Commonwealth with a status equal to that of the United Kingdom and the Dominions.2. Progress has been interrupted by the Japanese invasion and the social and economic basis on which it was being made has been destroyed. The first taskwill be to restore the essentials of national life on which any national government must depend. We wish to set Burma on her feet again financially and economic-ally. We also hope to take the opportunity of promoting such administrativereforms as experience suggests would be desirable and acceptable to Burmanopinion. Some time will be required for the re-establishment of stable conditions and for this work of reconstruction. For a limited interim period, therefore, forwhich we contemplate a definite time-limit of seven years, control must be in thehands of His Majesty&apos;s Government, acting through the Governor. But the tasksthus falling on His Majesty&apos;s Government will be performed-in consultation withrepresentatives of Burman opinion, through whom the co-operation of the peopleof Burma will be sought in order that the reconstruction measures may be on theline which they would desire.3. His Majesty&apos;s Governments desire is to repair the material damage done during hostilities in Burma and to restore the economic and social life ofthe country. The task of the material reconstruction of communications,buildings, public utilities and industrial undertakings will be a formidable one.In addition, adequate medical, public health, educational, agricultural and other essential expert and administrative services will have to be established. Thework of material and social reconstruction will require material resources andshould also include the training of personnel both for the administrative andtechnical services. It will be the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government togive such help as their own resources permit, when the time comes, towards meeting the expenditure necessary over and above that which Burma herself can reasonably be expected to bear. It will also be their policy to provide educationalfacilities outside Burma for young Burmans so that adequate numbers of recruitsfor the public services may become available in the shortest possible time. Thework of reconstruction and the building up of a nucleus of trained officers will thus provide great opportunities for Burma&apos;s youth to acquire the experience and knowledge which Burma will need when the time comes for her to stand on her own feet as a fully self-governing nation.4. During the first part of the interim period the efforts of all must bebent towards the urgent tasks of co-operating in securing final victory overJapan, restoring stable conditions in Burma and making progress with essentialmeasures of reconstruction. During such time as is required for these tasks,political agitation about the constitutional future would be unfruitful. Therewill be great need, and ample opportunity, for &quot;constructive work on the part ofall public-spirited Bumans whether in the actual administration or in advisorycapacities or in assisting and co-operating in the work of restoration.5. Though, when the urgent tasks referred to above for the first part ofthe interim period have been accomplished with the help of the people of Burma,there will remain much reconstruction still to be done, a stage will have beenreached at which it will be possible to consider and give effect to the processesnecessary for transferring responsibility to Burmans and drawing up a newconstitution in the form which the Burmans themselves consider most likely toconduce to the prosperity of their country and well-being of their people. It is thus the hope and intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government that at the end ofthe seven-year period self-government should be established in Burma thusequipped both materially and politically to take her place among the free nations of the world. &apos;
