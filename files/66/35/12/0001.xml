The War Cabinet, at their meeting on 23rd February last, invited the WarOffice to formulate, and to discuss with the Civil Departments concerned, new proposalsfor restrictions designed to safeguard our preparations for offensive operations.2. A further report was accordingly obtained from the Commander-in-Chief, home forces, and the problem was discussed between the Staffs of the Service Ministries andthe Chief of Combined Operations.3. Although the general trend of the discussion in the War Cabinet had revealedreluctance to reimpose restrictions for the previous reasons, their conclusions recog-nised that preparations for offensive operations necessitated a fresh approach to thesubject.4. As a result of this reconsideration certain military requirements and proposals as to the methods by which they should be met have been formulated. Although theWar Cabinet in reaching their decision must be guided by political in addition to militaryfactors, I feel it my duty to put forward for consideration this military point of view,with which I understand the Staffs of the other Service Ministries are in generalagreement. Consultation with Civil Departments through the medium of a meeting ofthe Security Executive over which the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster presidedon 19th March, revealed a substantial measure of agreement with the military proposals(if not always with the reasons for them), except for the proposed visitors&apos; ban on acoastal belt in East Anglia and along the whole of the South Coast.5. The military requirements are based on the following background:  (a) Re-entry to the Continent must necessarily be an operation difficult andhazardous altogether beyond anything we have hitherto attempted. Failurewould be disastrous. The chances of success will depend more than any-thing else on the degree of surprise which can be attained. In the face ofsuch high stakes, we cannot afford to neglect any practicable measure which makes even a small contribution to the smooth working of our militaryarrangements or to security.(b) We cannot hope to conceal considerable evidence that preparations are afootand must therefore make a virtue of necessity by spreading the generalevidence as wide as we practicably and plausibly can. This policy, withinwhich systematic deception and cover can be arranged, has been recom-mended by the Chiefs of Staff as an essential part of our offensive strategy.(c) As to the nature of the restrictions required, it is also essential that in assemblyareas near the coast, and in places where embarkation, practice assaults,experiments and such like phases of the operations take place, somewhatdrastic restrictions should be imposed, to exclude (or where this is not entirely practicable, at least to minimize) the number of non-participantswho are present. This is essential both to give as clear a field as possible tothe military and to reduce the number of witnesses.
(d) Some announcement to the public (and thus also to the Germans) as to theGovernment&apos;s policy is now necessary. Subsequent publicity must be theunavoidable minimum. After the first pronouncement, it will probably be best that all general public announcements of restrictions should be avoided,and local restrictions must not be promulgated outside the areas affected.It also suits our strategy at this stage that the publicised restrictions should appear to be as drastic as possible.. / (e) Subject to the above overriding requirements, both the extent of hardship and inconvenience and the number of persons affected must be kept as smallas possible.6. The War Office proposals to meet these requirements are set out at Annex I,and the approximate boundaries are illustrated on the map at Annex II.7. The main features of these proposals are:  :(a) The declaration under Defence Regulation 13A of certain &quot; Regulated Areas &quot;.The mere fact of creating a regulated area has no legal effect on thepublic but it gives the military authorities the right to impose local restric-tions. It is proposed that these powers should be delegated to ArmyCommanders and they would be used in consultation with Regional Com-missioners.The restrictions imposed might, if necessary, be drastic and severe,but would only apply to comparatively very small parts of each regulatedarea. There would, however, be a number of such parts. But the powers could and would be used in accordance with the principle set out inparagraph 5 (e).These local directions under Regulation 13A would often have to lastlonger than has hitherto been customary under this Regulation. They wouldalso have to be supplemented by orders from the Ministry of War Transportunder Defence Regulation 70, to close certain highways as necessary.(b) The super-imposition of a visitors&apos; ban over the coastal belt in East Angliaand all the South Coast. The effect of the visitors&apos; ban is well known. Thereasons why it is considered necessary from a military point of view are set out in paragraph 9 below.8. It is this last proposal which has been the subject of controversy, on suchgrounds as that:  (a) The visitors&apos; ban could not be enforced and would thus bring Defence Regula-tions generally into disrepute.(6) It would achieve a negligible addition to security.(c) It would impose a maximum of inconvenience on a category mostly composedof highly-deserving persons.(d) Population and road traffic in the coastal belt is already low.(e) All legitimate military requirements could be met by the &quot; Regulated Areas &quot;,if backed up by a general warning that local restrictions within such areas are liable to be severe and to vary at short notice. On this basis intendingholiday makers could take their chance, whilst the Government could notbe reproached by those who found that their plans had gone awry. Visitors,residents, and other travellers all alike would thus share the hazards whichwar makes inevitable.9. The contrary military arguments are:- (a) That, as stated at paragraph 5 [d), our strategy requires at this stage that theproposed restrictions should appear to be as strict as possible. The germans will not regard our proposals as seriously intended if their most advertisedfeature is the removal,of the visitors&apos; ban.(b) Small though its contribution to security may be, we cannot afford to neglectany contribution to the improvement of our chances of surprise.(c) The smaller the civil population in the coastal belts, the easier it will be tosecure smooth working of military arrangements. A visitors&apos; ban, althoughit is admitted that it cannot be completely enforced, does tend to reduce thepopulation.(d) We must expect our preparations to be interfered with by bombing.   Thisinterference will be lessened by reduction of the civil population also involved.Even though the existing population of the coastal belt is already low, thisis less true of the South West than the areas to which the visitors&apos; ban has previously applied, and in this connection also;the impossibility of achieving the ideal is no excuse for neglecting an obvious military precaution.   .
(e) The alternative proposal of allowing visitors to take their chance (as outlined in para. 8 (e) above) although superficially attractive is unsound. It mustinvolve increased use of transport. It must fail to secure or maintain the desired reduction in population. The presence of residents will inevitablymake local restrictions difficult to enforce, and to add the difficulty of dealingwith visitors would be folly. However much forewarned of the risks theywere running, many visitors would in fact feel aggrieved if they made plans and even set out for a seaside destination only to find that it had beenplaced &quot; out of bounds &quot;. To visitors and hotel keepers alike uncertaintywill cause a maximum of inconvenience and very possibly of loss as well;and the Government having weakened its position by trying to &apos;&apos; have it bothways &quot; would be less able to resist pressure for longer warning, widerpublication, or less stringent enforcement of restrictions, any of which wouldbe detrimental to military interests.10. In putting forward this case for consideration I should add the warning thatthe boundaries proposed for the regulated areas have not yet been agreed by the ArmyCommanders and Regional Commissioners concerned. It may well prove, therefore,that the new regime cannot be inaugurated until some date subsequent to ist April.The War Office,2ist March, 1943.P. J. G.
SECRET.ANNEX I.REQUIREMENTS FOR SAFEGUARDING OFFENSIVE OPERATIONSBASED ON THE UNITED KINGDOM.i. The undermentioned areas to be declared &quot;Regulated Areas&quot; under defence regulation 13a from 1st April, 1943 : (a) All the area to which, ^he^visitors&apos; ban applied last summertwA&apos;(b) A ^oa^taT*,stripi4 ^approximately 10 miles wide from Portishead (but excludingBristol) thence along coasts of Gloucestershire, Monmouth, and South Walesas far as Milford Haven.(c) A coastal strip approximately 10 miles wide from the North bank of the Humbersouthwards to join the area defined under (a) above at The Wash.(d) An extension of the present &quot; Regulated Areas &quot; in the West of Scotland to includeDumbarton, Renfrew and Ardrossan, but to exclude Glasgow.(e) An area in the East of  Scotland to include Arbroath,  Perth, Alloa, Falkirk,Penicuik, Dunbar and Edinburgh.2. The existing &quot; Regulated Areas &quot; in the West of Scotland to remain.3. Powers under Regulation 13a to be delegated to Army Commanders to define smallerareas to which access will be restricted or prohibited from time to time for long or short periods as operational needs require.4. A visitors&apos; ban to secure the same type of restrictions as were imposed last summer,to be imposed on 1st April, 1943, on : (a) All the area to which it applied last summer.(6) Additional areas so as to include the whole of a strip approximately 10 miles deepfrom The Wash to Penzance.(c) The Isle of Wight.5. If Regulation i^ja, because it refers to defensive measures, is now inappropriate,other Regulations should be used or made in order to impose this visitors&apos; ban.6. Bye-laws to be made, as necessary, to enforce more stringent restrictions in particularlocalities within the &quot; Regulated Areas &quot; defined in paragraph^ above, such as : (a) The closing of certain highways to civilian traffic.(5) The prohibition of binoculars and cameras.7. The local restrictions imposed under Regulation 13A or under the Bye-laws referredto in paragraph 6 will not necessarily be promulgated outside the areas immediatelyaffected.8. Exact boundaries of the areas referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4 are under discussion between Army Commanders and Regional Commissioners concerned.0(b42/127)   100   3/43   w.o.p.   13246
