THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJE&amp;TVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1943.SECRET. Copy No.---W.P. (43) 428.March 25, 1943.WAR CABINET.PROPOSED GIET OF DESTROYERS TO CANADA.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.THE Royal Canadian Navy are now short of Destroyers for escortoperations in the Western Atlantic, and the Canadian Government have asked us to help them. The existing Canadian Force is getting old, and replacementswill have to be found in the near future. It is not economical for the Canadiansthemselves to embark on the construction of Destroyers, as this would be anentirely new departure for them.2. H.M.S. Griffin and H.M.S. Decoy have been offered to Canada, and inaddition 2 Destroyers completing refit in May. The vessels will be used on escortwork in the Atlantic. It is hoped that for their part the Canadian Governmentwill agree to allocate for work with the Fleet on this side of the Atlantic 4Tribal class destroyers building or completed for them in this country. We havenow to consider the terms on which the British vessels are to be transferred. in w.P. (43) 56 the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for the--Dominions drew attention to the large measure of financial assistance which canada is intending to give to this country. I think that we should recognisethis by giving the Destroyers to Canada, and the Chancellor of the Exchequerconcurs in this view.  I ask the War Cabinet to approve the gift accordingly.3. There is a possibility that 2 more Destroyers may be bffered during thecourse of the year. The terms on which these vessels would be transferred wouldbe for later consideration.A. V. A.Admiralty, S.W. 1,March 25, 1943.[25219]
