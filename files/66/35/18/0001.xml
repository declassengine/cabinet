rprrrR DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTg     C RET /MR. ROOSEVELT\S PROPOSAL FOR A CONFERENCE ON FOODMemorandum &quot;by the Minister of Agriculture arid fisheries.      In his paper W.P.(43) 114 the Minister of Pood hasraised the question of the attitude of His Majesty-&apos;s government towards the proposed Conference and the aims to be pursued bythe United Kingdom delegation.2.     The invitation to the Conference having been sent out and accepted by us it is our obvious duty to do all we can topromote its success,     The Minister of Food has referred to thedifficulties of finding solutions to the problems that arise.I feel, however, that he has under-estimated the difficulties that will face our delegates.3.&apos;    If the Conference was to be mainly concerned with theprovision of some machinery like the Combined Pood Board fordealing with the allocation of-food supplies during the reliefperiod and for planning production and supply during that period in the long term interests of both producers and consumers, theConference might prove useful and successful.4.      But it appears that it is not to be concerned withpost-war relief measures.      It seems obvious that the agenda isto be based on the ideas contained in a memorandum &quot;Freedom fromWant of Pood&quot; prepared by &quot;A Group of Economists and MedicalScientists&quot; in Washington, which seem to owe their inspiration;   to Mr, MacDougall of Australia.and Sir John Orr, and with whichamong others Mr. Appleby of the UfS., Mr, Curtin of Australia,Mr. Nash of New Zealand, and Mr. Cairns of Canada (whose &apos;activities in connection with the Wheat Agreement negotiationswill be remembered) have apparently been closely, associated.t^P.(43) 118sath March,  1945WAR    CABINET
5.      In this memorandum the authors have just allowed theiJfenthusiasm to run riot.     The document is full of &quot;bravesentiments and airy phrases,  showing no interest in the practicJjproblems involved,  indeed, hardly recognising their existence -1&quot;The goal must he to ensure that all sections of thepopulation, farm people included, have enough of the rightkinds of food.     To accomplish this on a world basis wou&apos; \require expansion of production of the following orders:cereals,  50 per cent; meat,  90 per- cent; milk and otherdairy products, 125 per cent;    vegetable oils, 125 per cent and fruits and vegetables, 300&apos; per cent.&quot;6.      How is all this to be accomplished?      Section VIII,headed &quot;Action by the United Nations&quot; tells us.      It is reallyquite simple I      The United Nations are to pledge themselves to&quot;institute policies designed to secure that adequate diets for health are available within the purchasing power of all theircitizens&quot;.      They are also to pledge themselves to assist other nations towards the progressive accomplishment of the sameobjective.7.     The memorandum recognises, that a powerful cause of vtihait regards as excessive agricultural self-sufficiency in manyimporting countries has been the question of defence against possible aggression.     But this will not he necessary in thefuturei     Fear of aggression will be removed because the united nations will pledge themselves, amongst other pledges, to put anend to it.     This will smooth the way for the drastic reductionof agricultural protectionism and for &quot;the industrial countries of Continental Europe importing two to three times as much breadcereals,  sugar and feed grains as before the war&quot;.      It is assimple as that.     The industrial countries will then turn togrowing more protective foods.8.     No consideration is given to post-war exchange difficulties, nor to the need for a reduction in industrialprotection to correspond to the reduction in agriculturalprotectionism, nor to the problem of how countries with a lowstandard of living are to export enough to pay for the increased imports of food.     Nor has any consideration been given to the
political difficulties facing the peasant countries of europe in revolutionising their agriculture at a time when all governments will &quot;be concerned to maintain political stabilityamong their peasant population.9.     When it comes to the discussion of these matters atthe Conference,  one unfortunate consequence might be that:therewould be an apparent conflict between the United States and theBritish Dominions on the one hand and the European nations onthe other, and that in the interests of sanity it-would hedifficult for the United Kingdom to avoid supporting theEuropean nations.10,      It can hardly be supposed, that the proposed PoodConference could content itself with the passing of vagueresolutions about the general scientific questions relating tonutrition, exchange of information on national nutritionalstandards and agricultural policies and social- measures designed to make available a better diet to all classes of consumers. -   For if it did,  such a result would appear amockery to the peoples of Europe who are faced with starvationand would be a godsend to German propaganda.11.     But once outside this kind of general questions weshould be led straight to international questions relating totrade in foodstuffs, questions of monetary and commercial policy,  control of marketing,  etc., -i.e. to a general economicconference.      International financial matters cannot bediscussed in terms of food alone;    neither can commercial policy,  commodity control or international investment.12.     There is therefore a risk that if the scope of theconference is confined&apos; to generalities it will fail in its main objective, that it will be turned into ridicule by theenemy and (having regard to the way in which it has beensuddenly brought to the forefront) that it will cause great-disappointment to the other United Nations.
13,     On the other hand,  if the Conference is allowed togo forward so&apos; as to cover the full field Indicated in the invitation, it seems clear that it would he led into a discussion of fundamental matters of the utmost delicacy andpossibly with highly prejudicial results.     This would notonly include questions of commercial and financial policy, ftmight even raise the subject of political security,.14.     I would strongly support the suggestion contained!Lord Halifax&apos;s telegram No. 1359 that the terms of reference should be so drawn as to ensure that the discussions would be confined to foodstuffs and other essential agricultural products, and such as only to pave the way for the subsequentand separate discussion of related economic questions..(ltld.)
