THIS DOCUMENT. IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTSECRETDRAFT ANSWER.The United Kingdom.At the outbreak of war the number of adult refugees from Germany and austria in this country was approximately 55,000. A large number of these hadchildren, and, further, there were more than 13,000 child refugees who hadbeen admitted without their parents.In addition, nearly 10,000 Czechs had found a refuge in this country duringthe twelve months preceding the war.Since the outbreak of war there have been, it is estimated, the followingadmissions of aliens who came as refugees from enemy and enemy-occupied countries, viz. : in 1940 nearly 38,000; in 1941 more than 13,000, and in 1942over 15,000. The total number of these refugees in the three years 1940^-42 thusamounted to more than 66,000. This total includes about 20,000 seamen, but isexclusive of the very large numbers who have come as members of Allied Forces.The sum spent on refugees out of Government grants from the NationalExchequer between the 1st October, 1939, and the 31st December, 1942, amountedto  1,210,000. This does not include the expenditure incurred by the Ministryof Health, as no separate record is kept of the cost falling on this department in respect of the accommodation and support of alien, as distinct from British,refugees. From 1933 to the present date the contributions in money and kindfrom private sources are estimated at not less than  9,500,000.There are also large numbers of British subjects, for example, those fromthe Channel Islands and Gibraltar, who have had to be given refuge and bemaintained in the United Kingdom.As regards the Colonial and United Kingdom Mandated territoriesprincipally concerned, on the latest figures available details may be summarisedas follows : 1. Jamaica. Additional population maintained is 3,058; this includes558 refugees, 1,500 evacuees from Gibraltar and a number of prisonersof war and civilian internees.2. Cyprus. Additional population maintained is 4,830 (including 4,650refugees from Greece).3. East African Colonies. Additional population, including italian prisoners of war and Polish refugees, 90,964, nearly three times thenormal White population. Polish refugees, moved or in the processof being moved from Persia, amount to 21,000, and are distributed among Uganda, Tanganyika, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.Southern Rhodesia also has taken 1,000 Polish refugees. At the sametime camps in Kenya and Tanganyika have accommodated 3,000Greek refugees, in transit from the Greek mainland via Turkey and egypt to the Belgian Congo.Palestine.Over 18,000 legal immigrants reached Palestine between the 1st April, 1939,and the 30th September, 1942. The total number of Jewish immigrants who-entered the country during that period, including illegal immigrants, was about38,000, and the great majority of these came from countries in Central and eastern Europe. The quota for the period ended the 30th September, 1942,.provided for the grant of 1,000 certificates, 800 of them being allocated to Polish-Jewish refugee children in Persia. Actually, 858 children, accompanied by 369adults, reached Palestine from Persia on the 18th February last. The immigra-tion quota for the three, months&apos; period ending the 31st December, 1942, providesfor 3,000 Jewish immigrants, and this includes 1,000 orphan children and200 adults from former Vichy France. In addition, arrangements have beenmade to admit some 270 Jewish children from Roumania and Hungary, and ithas now been decided to admit further children from these countries up to a totalof 500. &apos;11995   [25188]
The Government of Palestine have agreed to admit from Bulgaria 4,000Jewish children and 500 adults, and the necessary negotiations for their releaseand transport are taking place through the Protecting Power. As the SeeretaryofState for the Colonies announced on the 3rd February, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare prepared, provided the necessary transport is available, to continue to admitinto Palestine Jewish children with a proportion of accompanying adults, upto the limits of immigration permissible for the five-year period ending the31st March, 1944, that is up to approximately 29,000.In addition, Palestine has provided a temporary refuge during the war forsome 4,000 people from Central Europe and Greece.India.b I .i India has provided accommodation, and where necessary, support for over400,000 evacuees. The bulk of this number is of India origin, but she has also received large numbers of evacuees from the Balkans, Malta and other areas,-covering many nationalities. She has already received 1,000 Polish refugeechildren and has undertaken to provide for 5,000 Polish adults and 5,000 morePolish children.It will be appreciated that a great part of the work on behalf of-refugeesindicated in this statement has been carried through by Government and localauthorities, and by private generosity, under exceptional conditions, with all thewell-known difficulties of food, accommodation and restrictions occasioned by enemy action or the demands of the war effort.
