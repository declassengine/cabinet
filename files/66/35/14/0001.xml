CZ^&amp;uJUJ&amp;j &quot;6 o, *****THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1943.   -66SECRET. Copy No.     g gW.P. (43) 114.March 22, 1943.WAR CABINET.Mr. ROOSEVELT&apos;S PROPOSAL FOR A CONFERENCE ON FOOD.Note by the Minister of Food.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government will shortly be called upon to appoint andinstruct delegates to the Food Conference which the President of the UnitedStates has decided to summon with the concurrence of the Prime Minister.2. Departments already engaged on the preliminary work necessary beforemembers of the delegation leave this country would be helped if the War cabinet would indicate its attitude generally towards the Conference, and moreparticularly to the aims which should be pursued by the United kingdom delegation. It is with the object of assisting the War Cabinet in discussing these issues that I am circulating this memorandum.3. The United States President has made it clear that the Conference isnot to be concerned with the relief of famine-stricken areas, which will have tobe undertaken immediately hostilities cease. This is a problem which will certainly have to be considered in association with the general food problem, eventhough a separate body deals with it. The scope of this proposed Conference isto be the production, distribution and consumption of food in the post-war periodthroughout the world, but more particularly among the peoples of the allied nations and those States which are associated with them. While I fully recognise the importance and urgency of the problem of &quot;relief,&quot; I welcomeMr. Roosevelt&apos;s decision to give to the Food Conference a reference which willbe of even greater importance, covering a wider area in the immediate post-war years.4. One of the greatest dangers I see ahead is the risk of a scramble for food imports among the nations of the world once the war is over, when most of their requirements will certainly be in short supply. If this is allowed to take place,,not only will the prospects of a satisfactory relief scheme be greatly prejudiced,but prices wiltfrorced up, all attempts at the stabilisation of the cost of living and wages will have to be abandoned, and in a short while over-production andinflation will result in the inevitable slump and world-wide depression. We shallbe back to where we were in the early thirties, and &apos;&apos; Freedom from Want &apos;&apos; willjust be another of these broken wartime dreams.5. We don&apos;t need to make this mistake again. Our war experience hasshown that there are means of overcoming the worst evils of shortages. Theactivities of the Combined Food Board have enabled such supplies as are availableto be allocated equitably. Prices have been prevented from soaring in exporting countries, including some which are not co-operating with the Allied Nations.But post-war policy will need to go further than this. Starting with a periodof shortage it will have to visualise a period of plenty and take positive steps tosecure it; it will have to devise measures for ensuring that while&apos;consumerssecure the benefits of plenty, producers, though deprived of the advantages ofscarcity prices, are not left to struggle with uneconomic returns as soon as their output exceeds current requirements. The violent swing of prices before the warleft the food producers of the world sitting on the steps of bankruptcy and the[25189]
consumers benefited so little that large numbers of people all over the worldhadn&apos;t enough to eat. In this country people won&apos;t forget that in a period ofgreat scarcity many were better off than in periods of plenty. There is a problemof organisation here which we have to solve else disappointment may give wayto disaffection.6. It is going to be a difficult task to find solutions to the problems beforethe Food Conference. They will certainly not be found by one Conference. Themost that can be hoped is that the forthcoming meetings may take an importantstep forward in the direction pointed by the Atlantic Charter. But in spite ofthe difficulties, I am glad that the President has selected Food as the first post-warproblem to be tackled. Food not only makes a wide appeal to the &quot; commonman,&quot; but a larger proportion of the world&apos;s population is directly interested in food production than in any other means of livelihood. Moreover, in foodprocurement and distribution war-time experience has much to teach which willbe of great value in the post-war years, and our own experience may be of somevalue to the world.7. At the same time I recognise that there is little prospect of a satisfactory solution to world food problems being evolved until progress has been made inthe discussion of wider issues of international trade and finance. These differentgroups of problems are not, as it seems to me, in competition with each other for first consideration. They are all different parts of one large problem of inter-national relationship. International trade in food will raise all these problems;they are questions of machinery; but, to agree on the ends to be attained is thesurest way to reality in promoting the discovery of means.8. During the.proceedings of the Conference it will be the special responsi-bility of the United Kingdom delegation to see that the interests of importingand exporting countries are fairly balanced. I see no reason fo anticipate thatthey will find themselves in the same position as our delegates to the WheatConference last year, who were obliged to &quot; stonewall &quot; throughout. At the food conference, the United Kingdom as the most important market for foodproducts in the world; as the nation which during the war has had the mostexperience of controlling the supply and distribution of food; and as the outstanding example in Europe of a nation which is prepared, while safeguarding the future of its own agriculturists, to content itself with a moderate expansionof home agricultural production-should not go into the discussions with emptyhands or come out of it without solid advantage.9. It would be convenient if the War Cabinet would determine by whatmeans the memberships of the United Kingdom Delegation to the food conference and its instructions shall be approved. I judge that this is not thetime to place specific proposals before the War Cabinet, but in association with my colleagues I am prepared to do so without delay.&apos;    W.Ministry of Food, W. 1,March 22, 1943.
