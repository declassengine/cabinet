EXPERIENCE in the Pacific, in the Mediterranean and in northern waters during the past year has provided us with many lessons which have to betranslated into provision for the future. These lessons have been very carefully examined by the Board of Admiralty, and the programme of New Constructionfor the coming financial year is based upon that examination.2. In considering these proposals it must be borne in mind that theindustrial capacity of this country in certain vital aspects which affect ship-building is now so fully occupied that production must be planned far ahead ifships are not to be delayed for such items as turbine castings and heavy forgings.Thus some of the heavy ships for which I seek approval will not be laid downuntil the next financial year, but must be ordered this year if the components areto be ready to time. The Treasury have authorised the placing of such ordersas have been necessary to secure continuous and economical use of the production facilities available.[25210]
The Programme is as follows : I. At Home 4 Fleet Aircraft-Carriers,8 Light Fleet Aircraft-Carriers,43 Fleet Destroyers,30 Frigates* (previously known as twin-screw corvettes),5 Corvettest (single-screw),14 Minesweepers, Algerine type,16 Motor Minesweepers,36 &quot;A&quot; Class Submarines,4 &quot; S &quot; Class Submarines,10 &quot; IT &quot; Class Submarines,24 Trawlers (Admiralty Type),3 Trawlers (Military Class).12 &quot;Fairmile&quot; A/S Craft, Type B,16 &quot;Fairmile&quot; M.T.Bs., Type D,16 &quot; Vosper &quot; M.T.Bs., Small Tvpe,42 &quot;Fairmile&quot; M.G.Bs, Type D,8 M.G.Bs., 501 Class.38 &quot; Power &quot; M.G.Bs., 71$-ft.

A ir craft-Carriers.3.   Events in the Pacific theatre, where the main Fleets of two great navalV Powers have been, and are still, fighting for control of their sea communications,have abundantly confirmed the importance of the Aircraft-Carrier.   Our needfor additional carriers accordingly remains both great and urgent.4. The Armoured Carrier is the only ship which meets the full require-ments of a Fleet Carrier. Four are now in service and 5 more are under construction, of which Implacable and Indefatigable are due to complete at theend of the year and the remainder in 1946. This leaves us far short of thenumber required, and I accordingly include 4 Fleet Carriers of improved designin the Programme.5. To continue the process begun last year as a short-term policy tostrengthen our Carrier Forces at the earliest possible moment, I propose to order8 more Light Fleet Carriers of the &quot;Intermediate &quot; type. Of the 16 already authorised, the first 4 will complete in 1944 and the remainder in 1945 and 1946.6. The year behind us has also forcibly brought home the - supreme importance of ship-borne aircraft for the protection of trade convoys, particularlyalong the routes where shore-based air cover either cannot be provided at all orcan only be inadequate. Of the 15 Escort Carriers (Auxiliary Aircraft Carriers)building for us in the United States and reported in my Memorandum last year(W.P. (42) 173), Avenger was lost during the North African operation, 8 arenow in commission and 6 more will follow during the next 6 months. We have,in addition, recently been assigned 19 of the United States 1943 Programme,which should begin to arrive in the latter half of this year.7. To these must be added our own building, of which 2 are now in serviceand 4 more are due to complete this year.  One more is due for completion in 1944.8. The sum of these programmes will provide a total of 40 Escort Carriers,which is substantial but not enough. We must aim to provide an Escort Carrierwith every convoy, and we are hoping for further assignments from the largeUnited States Programme shortly. The present assignments cover the period upto November 1943. I intend to press the United States to assign us as many aswe can man and equip with aircraft during the period after that date.Battleships.9. Our fears that the enemy might obtain the addition of French battleshipshave now receded; one of the four modern ones will eventually be in serviceagainst him, and another is removed completely from his power. So far as ourown fleet is concerned, the addition of A nson and Howe has brought our strengthup to 15, which will be sufficient for the present. As our need for aircraft carriers is now relatively much greater, I do not include any Battleships inthis programme, since they can only be built at the expense of Fleet Carriers.
The laying down of Lion has been suspended indefinitely, so that Vanguard isnow the only Battleship under construction; she is due to complete at the endof 1945.Cruisers.10. Much study has been given by the Admiralty to our Cruiser require-ments, having regard particularly to the lessons of recent experience applied tothe conception of a balanced Fleet. This has shown that, although small cruisers of a suitable type are still required for Fleet duties, it is clear that the Light FleetCarrier will in future, to some degree, replace the Cruiser on the ocean trade routes, both for the protection of our own shipping and for the denial of thoseroutes to the enemy.11. A suitable design of 5-25&quot; Cruiser to meet these new requirements is now in an advanced stage, but such a vessel could only be built at the expenseof a Light Fleet Carrier or Fleet Destroyers. In view of our far greater needfor these latter types, I do not propose to order any Cruisers in the coming yearnor to proceed with the remaining Fiji-Class Cruiser of the 1942 Programme.Destroyers.12. We are still short of our requirements for Fleet destroyers, and Ipropose to continue the policy of ordering as many Destroyers as we can findberths for. I therefore include in the Programme 43 Destroyers all destined for Fleet work-26 of the &quot; 1942 &quot; design, and 17 of the &quot; Intermediate &quot; type,which has been designed for building in those berths which cannot accommodate the larger type.13. Further study has confirmed that the &quot; 1942&quot; design provides the smallest hull which can accommodate the full requirements of a Modern FleetDestroyer. War experience has emphatically shown that, in addition to adequategun-power, torpedo armament, speed and endurance, a modern destroyer musthave a heavy A/A armament to give it a fighting chance of avoiding destructionby air attack.Frigates and Corvettes.Note. To differentiate more clearly between the single-screiv and twin-screwtypes, the latter are now called &quot; Frigates.&quot;14. I need not enlarge upon the urgent need for Escort Vessels, which isnow under such active consideration on both sides of the Atlantic. In this countrywe hope to produce approximately 200 Frigates and Corvettes between November1942 and January 1945. This number was envisaged in W.P. (42) 484 when theWar Cabinet gave approval last October to order 83 Frigates and 45 Single-Screw Corvettes.15. This is our first big attempt to produce ships larger than Mosquito crafton pre-fabrication and mass-production principles, and it may well be that, if our efforts are completely successful, oapacity will become available for follow-on
orders before I submit next year&apos;s programme.   In order to ensure continuity inthe ordering of material and equipment, I should like approval now to order an( additional 30 Frigates and 5 Single-Screw Corvettes, and these have been includedin the programme.16. As reported lasi year, the United States are undertaking a large programme of Escort Vessels, of which we may expect a share. Production has,however, been considerably delayed and we cannot expect more than 12 of these vessels before the end of September. Further assignments have not yet been made and will depend upon the relative needs of the two Navies balanced against their production expectations.17. We have, therefore, no guarantee that even our most conservative hopeswill be fulfilled, and I propose to take advantage of capacity for the building ofCorvettes which will shortly become available in Canada. I have accordinglyincluded 36 such vessels in the Overseas Section of the Programme.Sloops.18. For Ocean Escort work the Sloop has been more economically replaced by the Frigate. Its functions can also be undertaken by the modern Destroyerof comparable endurance.  I propose accordingly to order no&apos; more of these vessels.Minesweepers.19. The state of the Fleet Minesweepers is more satisfactory than that ofthe Corvettes, with which they compete for building berths. I propose, therefore,to order only 14 Minesweepers, of the Algerine type, in this country. In addition,there is capacity in Canada for 25 of the same type and I propose also to takeadvantage of this. These Minesweepers are ocean-going craft of good enduranceand, when not employed on minesweeping, play their full part as escorts of convoysfor which duty they are adequately fitted.20. The United States have undertaken to provide us with a large numberof Motor Minesweepers for inshore service off our ports and anchorages. Theseare already coming to us in such numbers that it is only necessary now to buildsufficient to make good our losses and to provide replacements for these hard-worked craft. I include, therefore, in the Programme 16 vessels to be built inthis country and 24 in Canada.Submarines.21. With the object of improving the -performance of submarines and increasing the flow of production, we have developed a new design, the &quot; A &quot; class.This is an improved submarine, eminently suitable for service in the East. Itwill replace the &quot; T &quot; and &quot; S &quot; classes. One yard cannot, however, turn over tothe &quot;A&quot; class immediately and will continue &quot; S &quot; class for a time, and thesmaller &quot; U &quot; class will also need to be continued. I have accordingly included36 &quot; A,&quot; 4 &quot; S &quot; and 10 &quot; U &quot; class submarines.
Submarine engines take longer to build than the ships themselves.   TheTreasury have accepted the principle that the Admiralty should order enginesin advance within agreed limits, and I propose to continue to do this during the  )coming year.Trawlers.22. These craft fill the dual roles of Coastal Escorts and Minesweepers. Weshould welcome any number of such valuable craft, but we cannot build annuallymore than 27 without interference with the more important Corvette production,this number is accordingly included.Coastal Craft.Fairmile A /S Craft, Type B.23. These vessels are employed in patrolling the approaches to importantharbours and bases, and in the defence of coastal convoys against submarine, air and E-boat attack.The strength at home has been brought up to such a state that it will sufficenow to produce craft to replace casualties. There is still, however, a considerablerequirement overseas, and we have encouraged building abroad, thus saving thewear and tear on craft which would otherwise have to make the difficult passage from this country.I therefore include the following Fairmile A/S craft, Type B, in theprogramme : 12 to be built in the United Kingdom.30 to be built in Alexandria.28 to be bruit in India and South Africa.M.T.Bs. and M.G.Bs.24. The continuing night battle between the coastal forces in the Channelarea is in many respects comparable to the battle which the opposing air forcesconduct during the day. We cannot afford to be outdone in numbers or class.Operations in the Mediterranean already provide considerable scope, and willprovide, increasing scope, for M.T.Bs. and M.G.Bs.The Vosper M.T.B. is a small boat of high speed suitable for operations infine weather.   It has the advantage that it can be shipped abroad.The Fairmile M.T.B., Type D., is a larger boat able to operate in the less favourable weather conditions. It has an endurance wdiich permits it to operate at greater range, such as on the Norwegian coast.We have a substantial M.T.B. construction programme in hand and Iconfine my proposals this years to 16 Fairmile M.T.B., Type D.16 Vosper M.T.Bs.all to be constructed in the United Kingdom.
The Fairmile Motor Gun Boat, Type D., is to carry as its main armamenta 6-pdr. gun and will, it is hoped, prove most effective against the craft used bythe enemy to escort his coastal convoys. We intend to employ four flotillas ofthis type specially for offensive minelaying.The &quot; Power&quot; Motor Gun Boats, 71-J&apos; Type, have proved most satisfactory.They have exceptional speed and are effective in engaging enemy E-boats and inescorting our M.T.Bs. in the attack.   They can be shipped overseas.We have still a considerable requirement for Motor Gun Boats and I include in this programme, for construction in the United Kingdom 42 Fairmile Motor Gun Boats. Type D.38 &quot; Power &quot; Gun Boats, 7l &apos; type.A new class of boat built by Messrs. Camper and Nicholsons for the TurkishGovernment has  shown  considerable  promise.   I  propose  to  continue  theconstruction in this yard and therefore include in addition 8 Motor Gun Boats, 501 class.Harbour Defence Motor Launches.25. These 72-foot craft are essential to the inner defence of bases and portsagainst attack by U-boats, two-man submarines and other devices. The successof our offensive operations has raised, and will raise further, demands to providefor such defence of new bases. To meet overseas requirements we are encouragingconstruction abroad.   I therefore include in this programme 48 Harbour Defence Launches to be built in the United Kingdom.6      ,, ,, ,, ,,     ,,     ,, Alexandria.6      ,, ,, ,, ,,     ,,        Mombasa.20      ,, ,, ,, ,,     ,,     ,, IndiaBoom Defence Vessels and Gate Vessels.26. These craft are essential for the laying and maintenance of the netdefences of our ports and anchorages. The spread of the U-boat threat to theSouth Atlantic and Indian Ocean has provided a heavy additional requirementwhich must be met. Of the 20 vessels building in the United States, it is nowimprobable that we shall get any, for the United States Navy has realised itsown desperate need for these vessels. I therefore include 8 Boom DefenceVessels in the programme27. I am also actively investigating the possibility of obtaining a simplerform of gate vessel both from Canadian production and from the boat buildersin this country, to help meet our urgent requirements. As a result of investigation to date, I expect to be able to build 10 of these craft in the United Kingdom duringthe coming financial year, and I include that number in this programme.A/S Cable Ships.28. These vessels, like the Boom Defence Vessels, are required for the layingand maintenance of harbour defences against submarine and surface attack. Ipropose to order 4 Cable Vessels of the Bullfinch type.
Salvage Craft.29. Operations in North Africa have shown the great importance of SalvageCraft for rapidly clearing captured ports. Requirements will inevitably increase as our offensive grows. Of the Salvage Vessels building in the United States, wehave not yet received any and cannot hope for more than 4 in the near future.I have therefore included 4 such vessels in the programme, together with 4 WreckDispersal Vessels.Tugs.30. Demands are increasing for tugs to deal with damaged ships at sea and to service ports and operational bases.   I include 10 tugs in this programme.Landing Craft.31. It is difficult in a programme covering the whole year to give an accurate picture of our requirements in Landing Craft and how we propose tomeet them. The general policy in this country and the United States is to buildas many Landing Craft as possible without undue interference with other essential requirements. The assignment of craft is dealt with, as the occasion arises, bythe Combined Chiefs of Staff in Washington and by the Chiefs of Staff in Londonworking in conjunction.32. By general agreement with the United States, from whom we may expect a reasonable share of the large fleet of Combined Operations craft whichthey are building for the United. Nations, we are able to concentrate now in thiscountry on the special types of Landing Craft that are essential to mount anassault. I am able, therefore, to confine my proposals for this year&apos;s programme to 5 types as follows :  536 Assault Landing Craft.104 Medium Support Landing Craft.qftn Tank Landing Craft.6W Flak Landing Craft.50 Mechanised Landing Craft, Mark I.Floating Dock.33. I propose that there should be constructed at Bombay a Floating Dockwhich will be a repetition of the Floating Dock already being built there forKilindini. When completed the second, dock will be placed at Bombay to meet themaintenance and repair needs of the Eastern Fieet in operations against Japan.United States Production.34. In last year&apos;s programme paper I included a list of the construction which the United States had agreed provisionally to accept to meet our require-ments of minor war vessels and ancillary craft. This large programme has in no way been reduced; it has, in fact, been augmented in many respects; but I wish tomake it clear that it can no longer be regarded as a programme intended to meetBritish requirements alone.
35. It is inevitable that war experience should have brought home to theUnited States Navy Department that these vessels and craft are as much aI requirement as the Main Fleet units. Their need is now therefore in some wayseven greater than our own, with which they must in consequence conflict. ThisUnited States Programme should now be regarded as production for the united nations as a whole, subject to periodical allocation to meet current requirementswherever the need is greatest.36. Financial statements are attached to this Memorandum showing theestimated cost of this programme separately and in conjunction with previous programmes.A. V. A.Admiralty S.WA,March 26, 1943.
