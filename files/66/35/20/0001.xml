A belated report has been received that the U.S. Destroyers Radford,Fletcher and Lansdowne during January arid February probably destroyed twoJapanese U-boats and damaged one in thejSolomons area. .
Enemy Intelligence. *German., 9. The Tirpitz, Schamhor-st, lutzow and nurnberg are reported in the narvik area.   The Scheer and Hipper were seen at Wilhelmshaven on the 23rd.Italian. other   has been no information of any change in the disposition of Italianheavy ships. - (There was a very slight increase in the volume of convoy traffic arriving in tunisia from Italy. - ^Japanese.On the^!3th reconnaissance of Sourabaya showed 23 merchant ships totalling85,000 tons.&apos; The five floating docks were all visible.U-boats. &apos; .- .There is still a large concentration of U-boats in the North Atlantic. Theyhave possibly been regrouped&apos; after their attacks on the two homeward-bound convoys carried out last week and early this week.Elsewhere activity has been slight; there are four in the Caribbean and theU-boats that were operating off South Africa may be returning to their bases.It is estimated that between 110 and 120 U-boats are at sea in the atlantic and about 100 are in Biscay ports.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending the 21st/22nd, 962 ships were convoyed. Ofthese, 247 were in ocean convoys and 715 in British coastal convoys.Seventy-six destroyers (including 16 U.S. destroyers), 106 sloops, cutters,corvettes and frigates, one A/A ship, one armed merchant cruiser and fourauxiliary aircraft-carriers (including three U.S. auxiliary aircraft-carriers) were employed on escort duties,During the week 90 ships,, in two ocean convoys, arrived in Home Waters.Six ships were lost.During the week ending the 20th, imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy totalled 811,000 tons, compared with 72,000 during the previous seven days and an average of 482,000 tons during the past ten weeks. Of the week&apos;imports, 260,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.11. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked and sunk eightships. Aircraft attacked five ships, four of which were sunk. One small ship was mined and sunk off the East Coast.In the homeward-bound Atlantic convoys which were heavily attacked at theend of last week, four more ships were torpedoed, making a total of 22 shipstorpedoed, of which 19 are believed to be sunk.Two ships were sunk in the Eastern Mediterranean off Derna, one off Baia(Brazil) and another N.W. of Capetown.Focke-Wulf 200 aircraft from Bordeaux have been active in the Bay of biscay and off the coast of Portugal. A convoy to N. Africa was attacked to thewest of Lisbon and one ship was bombed and sunk. Two days previously thisconvoy shot down One F.W. 200 in the Bay of Biscay.In the Mediterranean the s.s. Windsor Castle (19,141 tons) in an eastbouhdconvoy.was torpedoed and sunk by aircraft off Algiers. Two ships were bombed and sunk in Tripoli (L) harbour and a Norwegian tanker was torpedoed by-aircraft in Oran but is still afloat.British Minelaying.12.. During the week surface craft laid mines in Northern Waters and offthe Dutch coast. Aircraft laid mines off the GermanNorth Sea and Dutch coastsand off Biscay ports.[25208] B    - -
Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.13. Minelaying by enemy aircraft took place on one night of the week off the norfolk coast. A small fishing vessel was blown up off Rye and one ship sunk offthe Norfolk coast. Mines have been destroyed off Blyth, the Humber, Orfordnessand Start Point, and. also off the west coast of Iceland (C).In the Mediterranean 20 mines were destroyed south of Malta and also someoff Bone.  The mine totals are 4,226 ground and 2,304 moored.French Intelligence.14. Reconnaissance over. Toulon on the 13th showed that since the21st February one damaged cruiser has entered dry dock and one destroyer hasmoved from the roads to the port.   Three submarines have arrived.Enemy Merchant Shipping.15. The transfer of Vichy shipping to Italian ports continued throughoutFebruary, and by the end of the month it was estimated that not more than380,000 tons of the original 800,000 tons remained in the French Mediterraneanports, most of which is considered to be unserviceable.Fourteen tankers of a total of 95,092 tons have been transferred to Italianports.In June 1940 Italy had 55 tankers and up to the 31st January, 1943, had acquired another 50, making a total of 105, of which 31 are known to have been sunk. Her estimated tanker strength on the 31st January was 74 of a total tonnage of 319,164.MILITARY SITUATION,Tunisia.First A rmy.16. In the northern sector on the 17th a two-pronged enemy attack wasmade on our positions at Tamera. This forced our withdrawal to new positionscovering Djebel Abiod, which was completed by the 19th. The enemy pushed forward to within two miles of the village on the 21st, when they occupied Nefzastation. Since then there has been only patrol activity and some shelling ofDjebel Abiod.Further south on the 17th, in very bad weather, U.S. infantry began their advance on Gafsa, which was successfully occupied shortly after midday.Patrols were immediately pushed on towards El Guettar. which was occupied onthe 18th.Heavy rain and mud hampered the forward movement of the U.S. armoured forces to the north of Gafsa, but by the 21st they had occupied Sened, Next daythey continued their advance and occupied Maknassy. On the 23rd the high ground east of the town was occupied after opposition from the enemy.Meanwhile, on the Gafsa-Gabes road, 10 miles south-east of El Guettar,U.S. infantry established themselves on the high ground north and south of theroad, with a strong anti-tank screen between the enemy and Gafsa itself. Enemycounter-attacks of two battalion strength, supported by 40 tanks, were launched in this area on the 23rd. These were successfully resisted and 10 enemy tanks were destroyed.In support of these operations, in the course of which over 1,400 prisoners were taken, French infantry have carried out attacks against enemy positions inthe hills south of Gafsa, while camel patrols have moved eastwards along thenorth shore of Chott Djerid.Eighth Army.17. By the 17th the forward concentration of 10 Corps had been com-pleted. - Eighth Army was re-grouped so as to form three corps in preparation for the main assault on the Mareth Line.On the night of the 18th/19th a fierce action was fought by one brigadewith the object of seizing ground from which the main assault could be launched.Despite considerable casualties this attack was successful.After a heavy pounding of enemy positions from the air during the 48 hoursimmediately preceding the attack, our assault began.
Our main attack was launched against the northern flank of the MarethLine on the night of the 20th/21st. Our infantry made good progress againststiff opposition and by the 21st had established a firm bridgehead in the enemy&apos;sfixed defences.   During the 21st this bridgehead was consolidated.By the early hours of the morning of the 22nd our infantry were acrossthe Wadi Zigzaou. Although a complicated trench system and much machine-gun fire was encountered, part of our supporting armour was across&apos; the wadion the heels of the forward infantry by mid-day.In the early afternoon of the 22nd the enemy launched a heavy counter-attack with tanks. Severe fighting took place and lasted through the night of the 22nd /23rd. By the 23rd the weight of the enemy attacks had consider-ably reduced our bridgehead.In conjunction, with the main attack on the Mareth Line further forcesmade a wide sweep through 150 miles of desert and were directed on El Hamma,These forces made good progress and are now engaging the enemy 40 miles north-west of the Mareth Line.The Russo-German Campaign.(An outline map of the operations is included as an inset.)Northern Sector.18. According to the Germans, the Russians have been attacking stronglysouth-east of Leningrad without making any progress.South of Lake Ilmen the Russians have attacked continuously throughoutthe past week. There is little to indicate the scale of these attacks, which do notappear to have resulted in any appreciable territorial changes.Central Sector.19. The Russian advance has continued, although at a slower rate than before, and Durovo, a town 35 miles west of Vyasma, has been captured. Itwould seem that, as their salient has diminished, the Germans have been offeringincreasing resistance, and that they may have now withdrawn approximately tothe line on which they intend to stabilise.Orel-Kursk Sector.20. The Germans have been attacking the Russian salient north-west ofKursk. They have stated that in the Sievsk area &quot; the last remaining gap &quot;intheir lines has been closed, and that firm communications have been re-establishedfrom the Orel Sector southwards. They claim to be still making progress in this area, but admit that the Russians are fighting strongly.Kharkov Sector.21. The Germans have continued to advance east and north-east of Kharkov.They have captured Byelgorod, which is an important railway junction, and nowhold the west bank of the Donetz from there southwards to Lisichansk.Taman Bridgehead.22. The Germans have made a further slight withdrawal on their northernflank, where the Russians have occupied Petrovskaya. Slavyanskaya was alsoclaimed by the Russians on the 23rd.Summary.23. Thaw conditions have continued to affect operations and are likely to hamper them still further in the near future.There are signs that both sides are reducing their activity in preparation for the mud period. During the past week the Russians have limited theiroffensive activity to the Northern Sector, and the Germans are now attackingonly in the Kursk area. The German communique of the 23rd, after mentioningRussian attacks south of Lake Ladoga and German attacks west of Kursk, refers to the &quot; remainder of the firmly established Eastern front.&quot; It seems probablethat the Germans hope to force a Russian withdrawal in the Kursk area beforemud prevents all operations, but that otherwise they intend to remain on the defensive and hold their present line for the time being.[25208] &apos;  &apos; &apos; B 2
The fact that in the last few days the Germans have issued two statements of Russian losses further suggests thai the Germans consider another phase in the campaign as at an end. The Germans claim that, since January, the russians have suffered over 150,000 casualties and have lost in addition 10,000 prisoners,nearly 500 guns and over 1,000 tanks in the Orel Sector alone. They also claim that during the German counter-offensive in the Kharkov Sector, which began on13th February, the Russians lost 50,000 dead, 20,000 prisoners, over 3,000 gunsand more than 1,400 tanks and armoured cars. While these figures are no doubthighly exaggerated, it is very probable that Russian losses, both in men andmaterial, have been considerable.Burma.A arakan.24. An attack by our forces on the Japanese positions at Donbaik on theMayu Peninsula on the 18th penetrated the enemy forward defences but was unable to reduce enemy strong points and had subsequently to be withdrawn.The situation is substantially unchanged.The redisposition of our forces east of the Mayu has been completed. Weare now holding forward positions in the Taungmaw area, 18 miles north ofRathedaung.  There has been no major action on this front during the past week.Upper Burma.25. In general the Japanese columns operating north of Myitkyina, wherethey have been opposed by Kachin levies, appear to be withdrawing.South-West Pacific.New Guinea.26&quot;. Australian patrols have advanced north-west of Mubo (10 miles southof Salamaua). The Japanese appear to be withdrawing northward to Salamaua.;Another Australian patrol has reached to within three miles of Salamaua fromthe west, without encountering the enemy. According to report, Salamaua hasa strong perimeter defence which includes the airfield.AIR SITUATION.General Review. &apos;i.    27.   Bomber Command made a heavy attack on St. Nazaire.In Tunisia operations were maintained on a heavy scale in full support ofour land forces. ,United Kingdom.. 28. Twenty-seven enemy aircraft flew overland in daylight; a sharp attack was made on Ashford by 14 fighter-bombers, which, after crossing the coast atlow level, climbed up to 12,000 feet and released their bombs in a dive. At nightthree attacks were made by an average of 20 bombers, all of which crossed theEast coast. Nine enemy aircraft were shot down by fighters or A/A fire and six.others crashed in this country on the night of the 24th/25th from unknown causesin conditions of fog and low visibility. &quot;-Germany and Occupied Territory.29. During the whole week operations were very greatly restricted by fogover this country.   . .     , ;Day.30. Heavy attacks were made by TJ.S. Fortresses (B.17) and Liberators(B.24) on Vegesack. and Wilhelmshaven.One hundred and three bombers were despatched to attack the U-boat yards of the Vulcan Shipbuilding Company at Vegesack. Nearly all the aircraft attacked the target dropping about 250 tons of bombs. Photographs taken thesame day reveal very heavy damage; details are given in Appendix VI. the bombers were heavily attacked by fighters of which they destroyed 52 with20 probables and 23 damaged; two bombers were lost.
The second operation was directed against the Naval Dockyard willhelmshaven; 87 heavy bombers attacked dropping approximately 205 tonsof bombs. Weather over the target was clear and reports indicate that the bombing was generally good. Intense flak was experienced and a number of fighters were encountered. Casualties inflicted on enemy fighters are 28 destroyed,nine probably destroyed and nine damaged; one Fortress (B.17) and two Liberators(B.24) were lost.Two attacks (in each case by 12 Venturas (B. 34)) were made on the oil refinery at Masluis (near Rotterdam); 22 tons of H.E. and 240 x 30-lb.incendiaries were dropped. Weather over the target was hazy but there was nocloud and good visibility.   Escorting Spitfires destroyed two enemy fighters.Six Mosquitoes made a low-level attack on the railway centre at Louvain,-hits being seen on the engine shed and repair-shops. A similar attack was madeby 12 Mosquitoes on the locomotive works at Nantes, where about 10 tons of bombs were dropped; explosions were seen on .every part of the works and buildings were seen to disintegrate. Single Mosquitoes attacked an airfield and railway targets in the Antwerp area, and trains near Bremen and Hamm; at thelatter place 10 or 12 trucks were seen to roll down an embankment.      &apos;A number of attacks were made by aircraft of Fighter Command on targets in enemy occupied territory. Six Typhoon bombers successfully bombed the airfield at Alkmaar. Several locomotives and trains were damaged; in oneinstance an engine was seen to be blown off the track. -A photographic reconnaissance was made of Berlin, the aircraft makingseven runs over the City.From the above R.A.F. operations one Typhoon is missing.Night.31. On the night 22nd/23rd, 282 bombers attacked the U-boat pensand docks at St. Nazaire; over 900 tons of bombs were dropped. weather conditions were good, and, despite a smoke screen and some ground haze, themajority of crews were able to identify the ^target visually. The marker bombs were accurately placed, and bombing was well concentrated with several goodfires developing well towards the end of the attack. One very large explosion isreported from near the southern end of the docks. Flak was moderate with afew ineffective searchlights; one bomber is missing and one crashed on return.Twelve Wellingtons and three Whitleys released propaganda leaflets over theLille area, and one Wellington over Orleans.   One aircraft is missing from these;operations.On three nights a total of 27 Whirlwind bombers were despatched to attack the railway viaduct at Morlaix. Bombs from one aircraft were seen to burston the top of the viaduct causing a large fire, and on another night three hitson the target were reported; other aircraft bombed bridges and the railway inthe vicinity. Aircraft of Fighter Command attacked and damaged a number&apos; oftrains and locomotives in occupied territory. From these operations one Mosquitocrashed on return.Coastal Operations.32. Bomber Command aircraft, of which 55 were despatched, laid 156sea-mines in enemy waters; one aircraft is missing.Wellingtons bombed two enemy ships off Santander and two ships 70 miles.W. of Le Verdon; near misses were reported but no hits were seen.. TwoHampdens bombed enemy shipping off the Norwegian coast but results could not.be observed. Two Typhoons attacked and damaged a 1,500-ton ship, off the&apos;Dutch coast. Three Mosquitoes destroyed two Ju. 88s off the Gironde Estuary.&apos;.A Wellington was attacked by three FW. 200s 50 miles off Cape Ortegal; one enemy aircraft was damaged.      ... . . . ..rMediterranean.Tunisia. &apos;33.. In the Southern Sector the Western Desert Air Force combined withthe Tunisian Air Force to provide the maximum support for our land forces.At the opening of the 8th Army&apos;s offensive a greater number of sorties were flown than in any previous operations in North Africa.A very large scale of attack was maintained against enemy airfields. Theprincipal targets were the two landing grounds at Djebel Tebaga which for two&apos;
days were subjected to almost continuous bombing by light, medium and heavy U.S. bombers dropping fragmentation bombs. Many fires were observedamong grounded aircraft and after one raid no less than twelve direct hits were reported. Other landing grounds attacked were in the El Hamma (18 miles. of Gabes) area and at Sfax and Mezzouna; a successful night raid was made on the latter by four French Leo 45s. Only small enemy opposition was encountered and 12 enemy aircraft were destroyed and 19 others probably destroyed or damaged., seven of which were shot down during one raid; three ofour aircraft are missing.The main effort was made in close support of our land forces and directed against enemy positions, tanks and M.T. These operations, on some daysexceeding 1,000 offensive sorties, were not seriously opposed by the enemy airforce which fact possibly can be attributed, to the attacks made on his airfields.Towards the latter part of the week, however, small enemy fighter-bomber attacks were made on our forward positions and greater defensive activity was displayed.Reports confirm that considerable damage^ some of which was confirmed, by our forward troops, was caused to enemy ground targets. Many of these attacks were made in the Mareth-Zarat area, and on the 22nd, enemy concentra-tions were attacked with a view to opposing a counter-attack on our bridge-head.South of El Hamma fighter-bombers operated with success against enemyM.T. and tanks. One group of 40 tanks was accurately bombed, and on the same day Hurri-tankbusters obtained hits on 32 tanks, four armoured cars and one88-mm. gun; nine of these tanks were claimed to have been destroyed. On the24th, in answer to two army calls for support, Hurricanes and fighters destroyed or damaged 10 tanks, three armoured cars, two guns and 51 other vehicles; onepilot is missing and four Hurricanes and two Kittyhawks forced-landed within our lines.On the 2nd U.S. Corps&apos; front successful attacks on enemy tanks and M.T. weremade by Hurri-bombers and U.S. Aircobras (P. 39), and a number of vehicles and tanks were destroyed.   On the 24th, in the course of these and other operations,,nine enemy aircraft were shot down.At night enemy positions and concentrations in the Mareth-Gabes area were attacked by Wellingtons and Halif axes, assisted by Naval Albacores with flares;between 100-135 tons of bombs were dropped each night.In the Northern Sector the raiway station at Tamera and military targets in the Mediez El Bab area were attacked and a number of M.T. vehicles were damaged. U.S. Fortresses (B. 17) made three attacks on shipping at Bizerta andFerryville.Sicilian Channel.34. Two convoys off Cape Bon were attacked by U.S. Mitchells (B. 25)escorted hj U.S. Lightnings (P. 38). Two ships were set on fire and another ship and an escort vessel were hit. Enemy fighters intercepted these raids and asa result of combats nine enemy aircraft were destroyed and five others probably destroyed or damaged; five U.S. aircraft are missing.Attacks at night were made by Wellingtons and Beauforts. Two torpedohits were made on a vessel believed to be a large destroyer, a ship of 5,000 tons was torpedoed amidships near Marettimo, and another ship was hit.Sicily and Italy.35. Shipping in the harbour at Palermo was attacked by 24 U.S. Fortresses(B. 17) with an escort of U.S. Lightnings (P. 38); 64 tons of bombs were released,and hits were obtained on a ship at the outer North quay and on adjacentshipping. Enemy fighters intercepted and 12 of them were destroyed. Twosmaller attacks by Liberators (B. 24) were made on Naples.Night intruders from Malta were active and attacked railway buildings,rolling stock and goods yards; in addition, a total of 36 locomotive engines were destroyed or damaged. Escorted Spitfires successfully bombed factories atPozzallo (13 miles W. of Pachino) and Sampieri and also damaged fourlocomotives; three Spitfires are missing.Russia.36. Air activity on both sides along the whole front was fairly heavy inspite of the increasing softness of the ground due to the thaw. The Russiansclaim that during the week ended the 20th March they destroyed 298 Germanairpraft for the loss of 172 of their own.
Following the recapture of Kharkov, there appears to have been someslackening in the scale of G.A.F. operations in South Russia.The offensive which ended with the fall of Kharkov lasted a month, and it now seems clear that the greatest possible striking power of the G.A.F. wasassembled to support the operations; it is certain that operations were sustainedat a remarkable intensity throughout this period. The fact that this proved possible is one of the most remarkable recoveries of the G.A.F. in the course ofthe war, since all the indications were that, following the retreat from the Donand the Caucasus, both strength and serviceability had been seriously reduced and considerable disorganisation must have existed.The G.A.F. had, however, been forced back to bases used during the previouswinter and, assisted by the relatively static situation in the Donets Basin from mid-January to mid-February, accompanied by bad flying conditions, it waspossible to carry out reorganisation and refitting on a considerable scale. the effort which was subsequently reached and sustained shows the effectiveness of themeasures taken; nevertheless, the exertions of the past month must also havereached a point where a period of rest and recuperation have become necessary,particularly since more than half the total bomber and close support forces on thewhole Russian front are believed to have been concentrated for these operations.Burma and China.37. During the week Allied aircraft have given strong support to our forward troops in the Arakan area. Enemy positions in the vicinity of Rathe -daung, Akyab and Donbaik were repeatedly attacked by Blenheims, Hurricanesand Vengeances (A. 31); approximately 180 sorties were flown on these operations.There was almost a complete lack of Japanese air defence.The Myitnge Bridge was attacked on four occasions by a total of 39 U.S.Mitchells (B. 35); hits were made on the bridge and the northern and southernapproaches. Six U.S. Liberators (B. 24) also bombed this target but no hits were reported. The bridge at Pazandaung was bombed by 16 Liberators (B. 24), andat least one hit was made; this formation was intercepted by enemy fighters, oneof which was destroyed. Myitkyina was bombed by 16 U.S. Kittyhawks (P. 40)and two hits were made on the bridge N.W. of the town. The bridge atKadrangyang (280 miles N.N.E. of Mandalay) was attacked by eight Kittyhawks(P. 40) but no hits are reported. The Gokteik viaduct was attacked by U.S.Mitchells (B. 25) and Liberators (B. 24) and about 40 tons of bombs were dropped; one span was demolished and a further nine probable hits are reported.Wellingtons raided Bhamo and another force bombed the airfield at Toungoo,and hits were seen on the runways and the dispersal area. Hudsons (A. 29) andWellingtons bombed the airfield, at Magwe, and Beaufighters attacked the landing ground at Tennant.  U.S. Liberators (P. 24) bombed the airfield at Heho.U.S. Liberators (B. 24) made a hit on the station at Mandalay. Twenty-three Blenheims and 19 Hurricanes attacked a transit camp at Prome. the towns of Sinbo and Mogaung were bombed.  Mitchells (B. 25) bombed the phosphate mines at Lao Kai, .510 miles east of Mandalay; all the bombs fell in the target area and. photographs show thatextensive damage was done.Twelve escorted enemy bombers attacked the landing ground at Ramu,damaging two aircraft on the ground. Hurricanes shot down one enemy fighter and one Hurricane is missing. Twenty-one escorted enemy bombers attackedFenny airfield, destroying two Blenheims. Twenty-seven enemy bombers with fighter escort raided Wanhsien, 145 miles N.E. of Chungking; on the next day-six enemy aircraft made a further attack.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.38. Twelve Liberators (B. 24) and nine Beaufighters, with fighter escort,attacked Madang town, starting large fires; the airfield was heavily machine-gunned.Enemy positions at Salamoa and at Mubo were attacked by U.S. medium bombers and a number of buildings was destroyed and fires were started. Beau-fighters attacked buildings at Alexishafen.The harbour at Porlock Bay (50 miles S.E. of Buna) was raided by 15 enemy bombers, escorted by fighters; the wharf and a launch were damaged, but no casualties have been reported.
A destroyer and two vessels approaching Kaimana were bombed by allied aircraft and one ship was hit. The same ships were later attacked by threeHudsons (A. 29) in Kaimana Bay; one ship and the jetty were set on fire. Anenemy cargo ship of 10,000 tons was hit by an Allied aircraft off S.W.

Heavy and medium bombers made a number of attacks on Japaneseinstallations on Kiska; hits were made on a submarine base and a camp area.Two enemy aircraft were shot down by escorting fighters.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.43. Attacks have been made on land targets on three days and three nights.The most serious incident of the period occurred at Ashford in bombing by day,where the Southern Railway Works were damaged. The effect of the raiding onthe national war effort has been insignificant.By Day.44. On the 18th and 23rd minor incidents occurred at a few places inDevonshire. During a raid on Ashford on the 24th, in addition to damage tothe Southern Railway Works, a School, from which the children had reachedsafety, and 14 houses were demolished; other property was damaged. the casulties were 43 killed and 79 seriously injured.By Night.45.

Civilian Morale.The following extract from an editorial in a Stettin newspaper is ofinterest: We must reckon with the fact that- terror raids, contrary to last year, willbecome heavier and longer, just as the Bolshevik winter offensive was heavier andlonger, than last year. Bloody, burning, scarred traces are crossing the Germanface like strokes of a whip wielded by His Britannic Majesty&apos;s pilots. It iscertainly possible to withdraw the Air Force from the Eastern front for a counter-blow, but what would be gained thereby if, meanwhile, the decision of theContinental war slips out of our hands ? &apos;&apos;&quot; Reports describe a growing dissatisfaction amongst the population of towns recently attacked.   This is attributed to two main causes :  (i) The apparent inefficiency of the G.A.F. and the flak to prevent the attacks from being successful; and(ii) The dissatisfaction, due to the fact that the measures for assisting thosebombed-out are no longer adequate.As to the second of these, the chronic shortage of furniture and of householdrequisites, especially crockery, is the outstanding feature.&quot;Enemy-Occupied Territory.Rennes.Photographs taken on the 15th March show that as a result of the U.S.A.A.F.daylight attack on the 8th March, the Naval Stores Depot has been furtherdamaged, this time in the south-west part.
