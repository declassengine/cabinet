(43) 137.April 3, i943.TO BE JCEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.TUBE SHELTER INQUIRY.REPORT BY Mr. DUNNE.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.I have already circulated to the Civil Defence Committee (C.D.C. (43) 10)copies of Mr. Dunne&apos;s report on the London Tube Shelter disaster.2. I stated in the House of Commons on the 10th March that, subject to security considerations, Mr. Dunne&apos;s conclusions would be published.3. The report a document of 63 paragraphs is in narrative form, withoutany summary of conclusions. These emerge cumulatively from reading the text.Mr. Dunne does, however, end his report with the following &quot; two shortpropositions &quot; : &apos;&apos;&apos; (a) this disaster was caused by a number of people losing their self-controlat a particularly unfortunate place and time; i .(b) no forethought in&apos; the matter of structural design or practicable policesupervision can be any real safeguard against the effects of a loss ofself-control by a crowd. The surest protection must always be thatself-control and practical common sense the display of which hashitherto prevented the people of this country being the victims ofcountless similar disasters.&quot;4. Earlier in his report Mr. Dunne says that the &quot; main and proximatecause &quot; of the disaster was a forward surge at the shelter entrance by probably350-400 persons who had been considerably alarmed by the discharge of a salvoof anti-aircraft rockets. There are other references to loss of self-control, e.g.,though panic is not perhaps the right word, there is no doubt that the crowd.... remaining outside the shelter were out of hand and frantic with nervous-ness, confusion and worry, which heavier gunfire, and further salvos of rockets,did nothing to allay.&quot;5. Public reference to the psychological causes of the disaster would, in my view, be likely to assist the enemy. I am not much concerned with the propagandavalue to him of passages of the report which could be distorted in an attempt toshow that London can no longer &quot;take it.&quot; My apprehension is that full know-ledge of what happened after the alert on the 3rd March might tempt the enemy to make further raids on London (possibly quite small nuisance raids), where he must know that there are many tube shelters with restricted means of entrance,in the hope of creating a disproportionate disturbance and loss of life.[25256] B
6. With a view to meeting these security considerations i have had asummary prepared for publication, modifying the statements in regard to the psychological causes of the disaster, but in no way modifying criticisms of errorsof commission or omission in administration. This summary has been agreed by-Mr. Dunne.  It is embodied in the White Paper, of which a draft is attached.7. &apos; The omission on security grounds of the main and proximate cause of the disaster disturbs the balance of the report and therefore prejudices those;responsible for the administration of the shelter in their defence against criticisminduced by the publication of Mr. Dunne&apos;s conclusions. I have tried to correctthis by sending a copy of the full text of the report to the Emergency Committeeof the Local Authority concerned for their secret and confidential information.But their public defence of their administration and any public statement whichi make on the subject must be restricted to matters which appear in the white paper.H. M.Home Office, April 3, 1943.
DRAFT WHITE PAPER.TUBE SHELTER INQUIRY.CONCLUSIONS OF Mr. LAURENCE DUNNE, M.C.,Metropolitan Magistrate.- On the 3rd March, shortly after an air raid warning, an accident occurred at an air. raid tube shelter in London, as1 a result of which 173 person^ lost their lives and 62 others were injured and detained in hospital. an a: Statement to the House of Corrimohs on the 10th March, 1943, the Secretaryof State :&apos;for the Home Department and&quot; Minister of Home Security madethe following observations: -.--&apos;-&quot;:; .&apos; . ..&quot; The Government are determined to do whatever is possible to throwlight upon the circumstances attending this sad event. Without in anyway assuming that there was negligence in any quarter, the government wish to be assured, and wish the public to be assured, that any avoidabledefect either in the structure and equipment, of the shelter, or in the-arrangements, for its staffing, or for. the supervision of those within theshelter, is brought, to light, so that steps can be taken both in this shelterand elsewhere to minimise the risk of any repetition.&quot; For this purpose the Government have decided that an independentinquiry should be held, and I have appointed Mr. Laurence Dunne, oneof the Metropolitan Magistrates, to conduct an inquiry into the. circum-stances of rth&apos;e&apos; disaster.&apos; Mr. -Dunne1 will begin work to-morrow. as many aspects of the ihciderrt concern Civil Defence arrangements related to acts of war, on which it is undesirable&apos; that information should begiven to the enemy, the Government&apos; have&apos; decided in the national interest that the inquiry should be held in private; but the conclusions will,subject to security considerations, be published.&quot;Mr: Dunne opened his Inquiry on the 11th March and continued to hearwitnesses arid others &quot;from that date to the&apos; 17th March inclusive with theexception of Sunday, 12th JMarch. Eighty witnesses were examined, ofwhom four were recalled. - -As a result of the evidence given in the course of the Inquiry,Mr. Dunne in framing his Report and Conclusions had necessarily to refer to matters knowledge of which might be of assistance to the enemy. Allreference to such,matters has therefore been deleted from the conclusions printed below.Ministmj of Home Security,April 1943.   -TUBE SHELTEE INQUIRY.CONCLUSIONS OF REPORT.1. Immediate Cause of the Disaster.ON the sound of anti-aircraft fire people making for the shelter hurriedforward, and the pressure thus&apos; caused &quot;around the entrance to the shelterwas communicated to those descending the stairway at the same time.Almost certainly as a result of this; &apos;a&quot;womah fell on the third step from the bottom Of the&apos;first stairway. A man then :fell on her left. Those imme-diately behind were forced down on top of this man and woman by pressure,and in from 10 to 15 seconds there was built up -an&apos; immovable and inter-laced mass of bodies, 5 or 6 deep, against which1 the people at the entrance&apos;and on the&apos;stairs continued to be pressed. When movement&apos;- forward arid iritb.the shelter was arrested, there was still a crowd of 150-200 people &quot;outside,with more arriving. Their continuous attempts at entry transmitted sustainedpressure down the stairway&apos;for a further 15 to 20&apos; minutes, -by which timesufficient police had arrived to restore order and perhiit of organised rescuework.    &apos;   1      . : -..&quot;-&apos; - --. . ..  .r- i.       ... - s2. Contributory Causes of the Disaster.(i) A marked popular preference in favour of deep-shelter as opposedto other types, even though much more easily :rea&amp;hed.(ii) A realisation that current bombing tactics give the shelterer only-        a short interval to reach cover. . * . -(iii) A whoiesome respect for the dangerous splinters from our ownanti-aircraft barrage. - - ..    ,    ..(iv) An imperfect knowledge of the nature and appearance of variousanti-aircraft devices how in use:   -      -   .-; - &apos; : -    &apos;
(v) The desire of parents, some of whom were strangers to the shelter,to get their children under cover quickly.(vi) A desire on the part of the crowd outside the shelter entrance to enquire after, or assist, relatives.(vii) The presence of large numbers of children formerly evacuated, but since returned, which retarded the speed of intake into theshelter.(viii) The existence of only one entrance, a very exceptional if not aunique feature, having regard to the size of the shelter. But theprovision of additional entrances would only increase the potentialities-tiai bottle-neck in the booking-hall by augmenting the intakebeyond the capacity of the escalators.(ix) The dimness of the lighting, which increased the chance of a fall onthe stairs and was bound to produce confusion if a fall occurred.Once a fall had occurred, however, no lighting could, in theparticular circumstances, have prevented the course of the disaster.It was alleged at the Inquiry that there was no lighting on thestairs; this is erroneous.The lighting was dim, but necessarily so in order to avoidreflection into the street. The shelterers were particularlysensitive to the display of light in an air raid and attempts by theController to increase the Fighting had been met by the smashingof the lamp.There is no evidence of any direct complaint having beenmade to the Shelter Wardens about the lack of light.(x) The absence of a crush barrier, the result of which was to permit the application of a straight line of pressure against the peopleon the stairs by the crowd seeking entrance. This was the mainstructural defect at the time of the accident.(xi) The absence of centre handrails. &apos; Handrails down the centre ofthe stairway might have enabled a person falling to save himself;but if that person were burdened with a child in arms or a bundle as many shelterers on this occasion were their value wouldbe problematical. In the event of a jam. on the stairs, theywould almost certainly have aggravated the situation. As a contributory cause of the accident, little importance can beattached to their absence..3. Rumours as to the Cause of the Disaster.(1) The story, which had some local circulation, that the disaster wasa panic induced by Fascists or criminals for nefarious purposes is anabsurdity.(2) The suggestion that this was a panic precipitated by Jews is withoutfoundation and demonstrably false. The proportion of Jews using this shelterhas been and still is a hardly calculable percentage.4. Miscellaneous Complaints and Suggestions made to the Inquiry.(i) That the unequal width of sill between the line oj the gate and the topstair constituted a danger.The angle made the first stair rather awkward, but there is no evidencethat either this or the width of the sill had any effect in the accident.(i) That the stairs were dangerous in structure and in their obscurity.There was nothing intrinsically dangerous in the stairs, nor were theyout of repair to any appreciable extent. Falls, though not frequent, werenot uncommon; but those who did fall for the most part elderly women- regarded the incidents as petty misfortunes to be endured. No formalor specific complamt on this score seems to have been made to the ShelterWardens.(iii) That the air raid message &quot;Yellow&quot; should be reinstituied.The intention of this suggestion is to give an earlier warning to policestations so that there may be more time to assemble reserves for air raidduties.   This suggestion is recpmmended for consideration on its merits.5. Measures taken to deal with the Casualties.(i) The Chief Shelter Warden did not keep a record of the times ofmessages despatched from his post in the shelter. He shouldhave done so; but there is nothing to suggest that he was remissor tardy in summoning assistance from outside.(ii) The   Shelter  Wardens  generally   did  their   utmost  to  extricatecasualties but were powerless to do so.
(iii) There was no avoidable delay in dealing with the injured at anystage.(iv) Ambulance    and    Rescue     Services    worked    smoothly    andexpeditiously.(v) There is no cause for any criticism of any of the arrangements atany of the hospitals at which the casualties were received.6. Functioning of (A) Police, (B) Wardens Service.(A) (i) The Police Division has been organised on lines which combineefficiency with economy of man-power. Experience showed that, failing something exceptional, the patrol system adopted for dealing with conditions arising on the sounding of an Alertgave good, results.(ii) The constable who under the system in operation should havereached the shelter first, and should have been able to reach it before the accident, did not arrive until after the event. Thedelay may have been due to his stopping to caution people aboutthe use of their torches, but it was an unfortunate one. his presence might have had a sedative effect.(iii) Following the first constable&apos;s arrival at the shelter, police reinforee-ments were despatched to the scene as rapidly as they became available.(iv) The police cannot be expected to provide men on the spot at allpotential points of danger, and it is extremely doubtful whetherthe disaster could have been prevented, except by the presence ofpolicemen anticipating, and numerically adequate to control, thesituation.   Police provision on this scale was not. practicable.(v) A complaint was made in the course of the Inquiry about theabsence of police at the entrance to the shelter, but there is notrace of any prior demand having been made for police supervisionat the entrance either by the public to the Civil Defence authority or by that authority to the police.(B) (i) The rank and file of the Wardens Service has been adversely affected by the &quot; call-up,&quot; both in numbers and quality, to suchan extent as seriously to impair efficiency. This problem is not peculiar to the Borough, and in present conditions is probablyinsoluble.   The staff of this shelter has suffered with the rest.(ii) The Chief Shelter Warden, in the dispositions of his staff, madethe most effective use of them in the circumstances.(iii) No act of commission or omission on the part of the wardens was responsible for any aspect of the disaster, nor could they have doneanything to avert it. Complaint was made during the Inquiry thatthere were no wardens at the entrance. Had any of &quot;the wardensbeen-there, they would have been unable to prevent the accident.(iv) It was further alleged that there were no wardens at the foot of thestairs or, alternatively, that they had failed to do anythingeffective. The former suggestion is untrue and the latter unfair.It was, not until the pressure had been relieved from above thatcasualties could be extricated from where the wardens were.(v) Certain matters (such as the wearing of uniform by shelter wardenson duty, the checking of periods of duty, the recording of messages,and the precise definition and allocation of duties) may have tended to be regarded as automatic rather than as requiringconstant supervision. The regulation of these matters should be carefully reviewed, and, where necessary, revised.(vi) It is, generally speaking, undesirable that elected members of localauthorities should be appointed to executive positions in the civil defence Services, although the allocation of such positions toelected members of local authorities has been regularised bySection 10 of the Local Government Staffs (War Service) Act,7. Responsibility of Local Authority and Regional Headquarters.It is difficult to judge ho\v far the local authority should or indeed could have foreseen all factors1 that contributed to the accident and provided against.them. No similar accident had previously occurred. The physical imper-fections of the entrance are exactly reproduced in scores of other Tubeentrances in London and this may well have obscured the significance of the exceptional feature that the shelter had only one entrance. But the s&apos;helterwas not specially designed as such and the local authority had to make thebest of what there was. Radical alteration was at no time a practicalpossibility.   There is, however, one matter to which attention must be drawn.When submitting to Regional Headquarters in 1941 a proposal whichRegional Headquarters rejected for the replacement of the wooden hoardingssurrounding the stairway by a brick construction, the Emergency Committee
stressed the possibility that on a sudden renewal of heavy raiding therewould be an extremely heavy flow of persons seeking safety in the shelterbeyond its capacity and that the pressure of such, a crowd of people would cause the wooden structure to collapse and a large number of persons t6 beprecipitated down the staircase: that there was a possibility - of a serious incident at the entrance to the tube&apos;if the responsibility remained with the personnel above to prevent the overcrowding of the shelter. The Com-mittee, therefore, requested that further careful consideration should be givento the question of the erection of a strong gate at the entrance, and addedthat should their proposals again be rejected, they could not accept any responsibility for the consequences of a lack of adequate protection for the entrance to the shelter.As a &quot;result of these representations, one of the Regional technical advisers again inspected the approach&apos;&apos;to the shelter but remained of theopinion that it would be&apos;&apos;a waste&apos;of money to&apos;build up a: wall round the steps. In his view the existing fence with a little stiffening with salvagedtimber could be made very much stronger than the gate, and if anythingwere at all likely to be forced, it was the gate, which he agreed might be strengthened with advantage. On the: other hand, he recommended aproposal put forward for the first time by the Borough for a covering over the entrance in order to prevent water accumulating on the first: landing duringwet weather. This was discussed with the Deputy Borough Engineer.The Region thereupon communicated this view to the Borough and agreed tothe strengthening of the. gateway and to the covering over the entrancestairway.&apos; TheEmergehcy Committee replied that they, were of the firmopinion that a brick wall surround at the entrance was necessary, pointing out that this facility had been granted to other&quot; borbughs in similar circumstances and asking that the matter might be considered.... - As early as August-1941 the Borough appeared to have contemplatedand to have presented in unambiguous and clear language the very disasterwhich occurred. True, they regarded as vulnerable a part of the structurewhose weakness or strength would have no effect on the accident&apos; as itoccurred; but they also realised that pressure was to be expected throughthe gateway, that is to say, through the very channel by which it was sodisastrously exerted on the 3rd March. I attach entirely secondary import-ance to the remedies which were suggested at this stage for the dangersenvisaged. The real significance is that the Borough contemplated &quot; a grave possibility of a sudden renewal of heavy enemy air attack &quot;; that therewould be &quot; an extremely. heavy, flow of persons seeking safety in the tubeshelter&quot;; that there would be the possibility of &quot; a serious incident at the entrance to the tube, if, &amp;c&quot;; and that they disclaimed responsibility failing&quot; adequate protection for the entrance to the shelter.&quot;It was Unfortunate that, after the question of; the specification to besubmitted to Regional Headquarters&apos; had&apos;been discussed by &apos;the GeneralEmergency Committee, no members of the.latter had at any time attended the si^e with the Deputy Borough Engineer to discuss with him the problemcontemplated and the solution proposed in his scheme and specification. Itshould have -been obvious, if the representations above quoted properly setout the views of the Committee, that the measures proposed were quite inadequate to deal with the danger which was.present to the Committee&apos;mind.;&apos; The Emergency Committee&apos;s proposal should have been treated by the region as something more than a routine application for approval of theexpenditure of public funds. The Regional Technical Adviser, at a visit tothe shelter, omitted to consider any of the graver implications of theCommittee&apos;s proposal and to address himself to the question of the adequacy of the Borough Engineer&apos;s proposal to deal with the dangersuggested. It was part of the Regional Technical AdviserV duty to condemnor criticise proposals which did not seem to met any particular problemraised, and his omission to do so in this instance was unfortunate. It isfor the Region and ultimately for the Minister to decide whether responsi-bility for tendering such advice rested with him alone or whether there is another official at Region whose duty it is to satisfy himself that once suchan issue is raised it receives proper attention.   ;Whilst the primary responsibility rests on the local authority, the delegation to Regional Commissioners by the Minister of authority to give directions * imposes on them a duty, when there is brought to their noticea particular matter of a nature likely to require the exercise of the powerto see that proper advice is tendered to the local authority, and that if such advice is neglected, a direction follows.*Note.-The circular acquainting local authorities of the delegation of powersto Regional Commissioners m regard to the. provision of Air Raid Shelters is printed below.15th June, 1940.Home Security Circular- No. 133/1940.Delegation of Powers to regional Commissioners; Provision of Air Bard Shelters.I am directed by the Minister of Home Security to. refer to Home SecurityCircular No. 114/1940, in which you were informed of his decision to delegate to regional Commissioners certain powers conferred on him by Defence Regula-tion 29A in regard to the control and direction of Civil Defence operational services.I am now to inform you that the Minister&apos;has decided also to delegate to Regional
I limit my criticism of the conduct of the General Emergency Com-mittee and Regional Headquarters to this. A. matt&amp;r of great importancehaving been raised, the Emergency Committee and the Region failed tosee that it was properly understood and considered by their technical officers. It by no means follows that the steps which might have beentaken in the light of the experience gained up to that date would have beenthose now suggested or that they would have been adequate to prevent the accident which has occurred.8.   Future Precautions (A) at the Shelter concerned, and (B) at other LargeShelters.(A) At the Shelter concerned.(i) The measures already completed or in hand include the constructionof a covered way leading to the shelter entrance, adequate lightingof the stairs and approaches, division of the stairs by two sets ofhandrails, and the provision of a crush barrier to prevent pressure.These measures should provide as efficient a safeguard against further accidents as can practically be devised.(ii) The most outstanding internal weakness of the shelter is beingremedied by the provision of a third escalator from the booking-hall.(hi) The police have, until further orders, re-instituted a permanent postat the shelter entrance.(iv) Consideration should be given to the question of installing signals(e.g., red lights) in the entrance and approaches to the shelterproper, which wardens could operate to warn those entering to stand fast until further instructions.(B) At other Large Shelters.(i) Entrances   should   be   protected  from, direct  pressure  by   crushbarriers.&apos; (ii) Entrances should be screened so as to permit proper lighting onstairways, &amp;c.(iii) The provision of additional handrails should be considered.9. General Conclusion.This disaster was caused by a number of people hurrying forward toenter the shelter at a particularly unfortunate place and time. No fore-thought in a matter of structural design or practicable police supervision canbe any real safeguard against conditions such as then prevailed.Commissioners, with immediate effect, the powers conferred on him under para-graph 3 of the Regulation, to give directions to local authorities as to theprovision of air raid shelters. These powers will enable Regional commissioners to issue to local authorities such instructions, either general or detailed, as to theprovision of air raid shelters as they may consider necessary in the light of local circumstances. The Minister desires, however, to make it clear that in taking,and delegating these powers in the measure indicated he is in no way abrogatingthe responsibilities with which local authorities are charged for securing theprovision of adequate shelter with the utmost energy and expedition.The Clerk of the County Council.The County Clerk.The Town Clerk.The Clerk of the District Council.
