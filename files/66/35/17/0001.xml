March 19SECRETW.P. (43) 117.March 23, 1943.WAR CABINET.TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (INTERIM DEVELOPMENT) BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I have read the memorandum by the Minister of Town and country planning (W.P. (43) 111) and desire to make some comments thereon. I admit the force of the arguments in paragraph 2. Nevertheless, it is to be anticipatedthat the Government will be criticised on the ground that, notwithstanding thefact that the Scott and Uthwatt Reports were received by the Government inJuly and August 1942, the Bill includes only restricted amendments to theexisting Town and Country Planning Act. So long as the compensationproblem is not dealt with, town and country planning is bound, I think, to bemore or less a farce, for when the planning authorities are faced with substantialclaims for compensation the general result in relation to most of the important issues will be &quot;no action.&quot; The situation is particularly difficult when it is desired to sterilise agricultural land. It is, therefore, of the utmost urgencythat decisions, particularly in relation to the Uthwatt Report, should be reached.With regard to the planning authorities, I am not convinced by thearguments of the Minister of Town and Country Planning in paragraph 3.Indeed, the Minister&apos;s policy of establishing Joint Committees is an admission that the County District is an inadequate area for town and country planning purposes, and in his present memorandum he says that he agrees with the necessityfor larger planning units and that this is the reason for taking additional powersto combine local authorities for planning purposes through Joint Committees.My arguments against the proposals in the draft Bill are as follows : (a) Planning, to be successful, must involve taking a wide view and a wideview is not normally to be expected from County District authorities.In the London Region alone there are 95 County Districts; in birmingham Region 121; and in Manchester Region 193. Planningmay involve a deliberate restriction on further building in a county district, the limitation of its population and of its rateable value. Itmust be expected that many County Districts will be averse from such restrictions on their development. Moreover, County Districts,especially Rural District Councils, have not staff of * the necessaryquality for dealing with the complex problems of valuation, &amp;c, which planning involves.(b) In effect, the Minister of Town and Country Planning admits the soundness of these arguments, or, at any rate, the conclusions to be. drawn from them, and he meets that by the establishment of joint committees.   A joint authority, however, is a clumsy instrument ofpublic administration there is too much &quot;joint&quot; and not enough&apos;&apos; authority &apos;&apos; about it.  Moreover, the representatives of the separatelocal authorities are-liable to think more about their local intereststhan wider interests, and may well be unwilling to put up with the. financial consequences to themselves-of planning schemes approved bythe joint authority.   Joint Committees are insufficiently coherent.- They lack that corporate spirit which the popularly elected authoritytends to evolve.   Joint Committees are, at best, an expedient to meet[25199]Copy No.
difficult circumstances. They ought not to be encouraged as properbodies to exercise important functions affecting the whole community.(c) The argument of the Minister in paragraph (iii) that County Districtsare housing and sewer authorities and often the water authorityseems to me to be irrelevant. The County Council is the principalhighway authority, and it has often been said that highways are the&quot;skeleton&quot; of town and country planning. County Councils haveextensive powers in relation to education, hospitals, agriculture andother matters which are elements in town and country planning notless important than housing and sewers. In any case, the interests ofthe County Districts can be met, if desired, by the County Councilbeing required to consult them before schemes are approved.(d) It is argued that, even if the County Council were the primary planning authority, Joint Committees would, in any case, be required, forexample, between Counties and County Boroughs or even betweenCounties and Counties. This may be so in a number of cases, althoughit might be possible to settle fringe problems by direct consultation.But, in any case, the fewer the authorities represented on a JointCommittee, the more likely the Joint Committee is to be successful.. This brings me to the next point.(e) The Bill as proposed seems to preserve what, in my view, was a weakness of town planning administration before the war. Broadly speaking,what happened then was that the local authorities put up theirschemes for ministerial approval and they were examined on their local merits rather than their relationship to a desirable regional plan as a whole or to essential principles of national planning, includingthe location of industry. I suggest that this parochial policy shouldbe terminated, and that the Ministry of Town and Country Planningmust have a mind of its own as to- -(i) the broad lines of national development, including the location of industry; and(ii) the broad lines of development within Regions.The local planning authorities should be required to take account ofthese principles, and the Ministry, through its Regional Officers,should see that these national principles are observed. Consequently,when proposals are submitted by local authorities they should be examined by the Regional Planning Officer and the Ministry from three points of view local, regional and national. It, therefore,follows that the responsibility for taking the really big view passesfrom the local authority to the Minister of Town and Country planning and his Regional Planning Officers.(/) Another advantage about such a scheme would be that the RegionalOfficers would have two functions (i) to interpret to and, if necessary,to impose upon the local planning authorities the essential nationalprinciples being pursued by the Ministry; and (ii) to impress upon theMinistry the importance of the local point of view where, in the judgment of the Regional Planning Officer, that point of view was right. The Regional Planning Officer would be the intermediary between the State and the local planning authority, and it would be important to recognise that his should be a two-way traffic. Moreover,it seems to me that the Regional Planning Officer should have a competent valuation and architectural staff, not only for the purposeof vetting proposals of the local planning authorities, but for thepurpose of helping the local planning authorities. It would clearly be important that the Regional - Planning Officers should be officers of administrative skill and tact, and, in the circumstances which Ivisualise, they would acquire a position of considerable informalauthority as time went on. They would need to have a picture of thedesirable development of their Region, towards which they would workin harmony with the national policy of the Minister. In thesecircumstances, Joint Committees seem to me to become largelyredundant.(g) It may be that in a number of cases outside London Joint committees have done valuable work, but one must draw one&apos;s own conclusionsfrom the fact that it is now necessary to require local authorities toproduce planning schemes.   I have myself had experience of a fair
amount of Joint Committee administration and, for the reasons given above, I think they should be avoided in all cases where they are not really necessary.(h) There is also the argument that the proposal to transfer planning powers from County Districts to County Councils will be controversial. Itwill. Any proposal to modify the powers of local authorities iscontroversial. On the other hand, the proposal would, I imagine, be supported by the County Councils&apos; Association. In any case, what we have to do is to decide what is right and not to scamper away from what is right because of the prospect of what would prove to be ashort, sharp and relatively minor Parliamentary battle.(i) Nor do I agree that this proposal impedes the wider reorganisation oflocal government, as to the necessity of which there may well be morethan one view. From the point of view of legislative priority thespeculative possibility of the radical reorganisation of local govern-ment should not prevent the Government making adjustments in thedistribution of specific functions among the various classes of localauthorities.I hope, therefore, that the Bill will provide not for the further cluttering upof local administration by Joint Committees, but will propose to transfer townand country functions from the County Districts to the County Councils, whichare much more likely to develop proper staffs for the administration of thiscomplex but important function. In any case, the Minister will no doubt see thatthey do acquire proper staffs for the purpose in cases where they do not already possess them.H. M.Home Office, March 23, 1943.
