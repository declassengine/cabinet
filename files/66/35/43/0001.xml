IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC majesty S GOVERNMENE) -219WAR cabinet copy No.  *Je)POST-WAR COMMERCIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary oT State  or India.I trust the War Cabinet will not authorise thedespatch of the. proposed draft telegram to the dominions on the suggested scheme for a Commercial Union withoutfurther consideration of some of the difficulties inherent in the scheme which are not dealt with in the telegram orin the very inadequate and indeed misleading presentation of the views of-those .who are. opposed to the scheme, in.principle.The scheme claims to be an attempt to carry out .Article 7 of the Lease-Lend Act and in particular   the objective of &quot;the elimination of all forms of discriminatorytreatment in international commerce&quot;.   It is well known;that by this phrase the Americans have specially wished to reaffirm their adherence to the principle of the unconditional Most Favoured Nation Clause;   The proposedCommercial Union is, of course, entirely inconsistent withthe maintenance of this clause.   For obviously there can beno inducement to join the Union and obey its rules and the findings of its Council if those who stay outside are,under existing Most Favoured Nation treaties, to secure all its advantages for nothing.   The scheme, in fact, proposes that the Council, is to &quot;expel&quot; members who do not behave.But there is nowhere any suggestion as .to what thesanction is to be.   Are those who do not join or areexpelled to be prohibited from trade with members of theUnion or are they to be subject to a special higher tariff?One or other is necessary if the Union is to be worthjoining.   But nothing is said as to how this Is to be done or about the denunciation.of the Most Favoured Nationtreaties which- is necessarily,involved.The &quot;Commercial Union&quot; must, in fact, if it is to -attract any members,-be a preferential scheme inconsistent with most favoured nation treatment to those outside it.Has that point been considered?   Or has any estimate been attempted as to what nations are sufficiently interestedin adopting a&apos;low tariff policy themselves to bo preparedto join?   There are very few countries that are not more concerned with the protection either of a high standard ofLiving or of new industries than with the prospects oftheir exports.     It seems to me extremely unlikely that australia, for instance, on the one hand, or India, on theother, will be prepared to bind themselves to the&apos;kind of tariffs envisaged,, let alone china or many european countries.The telegram makes no attempt to face tho fact that state trading is -entirely inconsistent with the proposed scheme.   There is no possible way of estimating Whether aState like Russia is prepared to buy foreign goods provideirig they are X per &quot;cent, cheaoer than its own products.All state purchases are&apos;also quantitatively restricted by what the Government thinks it good to buy, not by ordinarySECRETW.P.(43V 1437th April 1945.

commercial considerations.   Similarly there is no means ofknowing what degree of export subsidy is contained in theprice at which a Government like the Russian sells such goods as it chooses to sell.There is in this country- a general consensus ofopinion that stable prices in agriculture can only bemaintained either by state purchase and resale at a higher price (which is only another form of tariff plusquantitative restriction) or levy-subsidy (which would almost certainly be a rate of duty above that contemplated in the scheme).   An agricultural policy based on one orother of these methods is, in fact, advocated by the twoagricultural ministers and is before the War Cabinet,Should not the War Cabinet come to some decision on thismatter of such vital import to the United Kingdom beforerecommending favourably to the Dominions a scheme entirelyinconsistent with it?No attempt is made to discuss the bearing on thisscheme of the problem of defence, beyond a suggestion inthe original departmental project that claims for special protection on security grounds should be judged by &quot;!an appropriate international body&quot;.   What international body and what state is going to submit to an outside bodywhether it may grow enough food in order to be safe in timeof war, or develop an aeroplane industry or a motor-carindustry or more generally any of the industries like ironand steel, aluminium, plastics,.&apos; etc. , etc, etc, whichare essential to defence under modern conditions?The telegram also professes to put forward thearguments of those who are opposed to the suggestedCommercial Union, but in a form which hardly does justice to the strength of their case.   Apart.from the generalobjections, to the scheme indicated above there arespecific objections from our own point of view in thiscountry, and, I believe, also from the point of view ofthe Dominions which should at any rate be indicated0It is. I venture to suggest, a wholly out-of-dateidea that our interest-s as an exporting country will best be served by the lowering of tariffs all round.   It is notmerely, as is suggested in paragraph 14(11) on page 9, thata lowering of the American tariff would give us little helpas&apos; against American industry.    The question is whether itwould give us much help as against the industries of other nations equally well-equipped industrially as ourselves,but with a lower standard of living.   We have neither theadvantage of the colossal scale of American industry, built up on a vast reserved market, nor the low wages of othercompetitors.   What we have got, ,owing to our high standardof living and our advanced social legislation, is a veryrich and relatively stable consumers&apos; market,   This is our most powerful bargaining asset.   It can be used, and hasbeen used, most effectively both in inter-Imperi-alnegotiation where the Most Favoured Nation Clause does notapply, and in negotiations, like those with the scandinavian countries, where a skilful, use of classific-ation and of quantitative restriction has in fact enabled us to circumvent it.  -in the proposed Commercial Union weshould sacrifice that bargaining asset for such share aswe might get of the hypothetical advantage of lowertariffs from other members of the Union (and possiblyvery much higher tariffs- from the non-member countries. )More than half of our total exports have in recent years

gone to Empire countries where we have enjoyed direct or indirect preferential advantages, or to such countries asScandinavia or the Argentine where we have also built upa special position and enjoy virtual preference.   Can weafford to risk any of these positive and concreteadvantages for a pure gamble?The same, it seems to me, applies in large measure tothe Dominions.   They produce a surplus at bottom world prices of one or two articles like wheat or wool.- But inthe main they are high standard countries, which have anuphill fight to compete in an open world market with mostof their products, but with very rich consumers * marketsrelative to their population.   The Australian-, Mew zealand and South African meat, dairy produce, fruit and wine-industries are all dependent on the market of this countryand have been largely sustained and expanded by Empirepreference.   Canada, on the other hand, has throughImperial preference in this country and in other empire countries developed not only her export of many kinds ofagricultural produce, but also her motor-car and other industrial exports.   Will they, once they begin to lookseriously at the situation, be so anxious to lose theadvantages which they have enjoyed?   Will they thank us for sending them a memorandum which glosses over all these aspects of the question?Quite apart from any question of our common interest,in defence or of any recognition of the part that, theDominions have played in the last two great struggles, Iwould suggest that the&apos; economic conditions as between theDominions and ourselves are:precisely those which tend tomake a mutually preferential scheme of real value to allconcerned.   The same applies in considerable measure tothe Scandinavian countries, or even to the United States,if they were to come into a more limited preferentialarrangement with us.   But the aspect of defence and of mutual responsibility for each others1 welfare cannot be ignored in the case of the Dominions.   Still less can itbe ignored in the&apos; case of the Colonies for w.hose socialstandards we have a direct responsibility.   The idea thatour responsibilities in this respect can be met by directmonetary subsidy entirely leaves out of account both the magnitude of the problem of post-war finance and the limit to external payments, even within&apos; the sterling area.The real problem, it seems to me, which we ought to answer for ourselves, and present clearly to the Dominions,is whether we are in favour of the maintenance of the non-.discriminatory, in other words indiscriminate. most favoured Nation clause to the fullest, even at the sacrifice of Imperial Preference, or whether we should aim at securing the widest measure of preference for ourselves,and for our fellow citizens in the Empire, firstly byretaining and developing our existing right to &quot;disregard the Most Favoured Nation clause in our mutual relations and, secondly, by getting rid of the Most Favoured nation clause, either altogether or through some such device.asa Three-decker Tariff, in our negotiations with foreigncountries.   My own view, for what it is worth, is that thelatter will not only benefit us most, but will alsocontribute most to the general lowering of tariffs and tothe expansion of world trade.   The Most Favoured Nationprinciple, originally devised to spread low tariffs, has

long worked in the opposite direction.     For every onehesitates to give concessions, in return for specificfavours, which then have to be given to all those whogive nothing in return.The first step therefore is to find out how we of theEmpire, and then the United states, stand on the questionof the Most Favoured Nation principle.   If the Americansinsist on it we should, at the very least, retain theright to continue and develop Imperial Preference not only,as an admitted and recognised exception but as an inherentright.   If the Americans are prepared to give way on theprinciple we can then discuss other methods of fosteringmutual trade, whore interests are mutual, withoutprejudice to our right to maintain Imperial Preference.I doubt very much whether such discussions would lead tothe kind of Commercial Union suggested, but the matter could at any rate be discussed on a logical basis.Meanwhile I suggest that we should clear our own mindson the problem before confusing the mind of the Dominionswith insufficiently thought out projects.Ii .
