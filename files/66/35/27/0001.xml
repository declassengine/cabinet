A. J.4 Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,March 26, 1943.POST-WAR RECONSTRUCTION-QUARTERLY SURVEY.I. External Affairs.1. The Clearing Union Scheme. yA. scheme for an International Clearing Union, prepared by United kingdon departments for discussion under Article 7 of the Mutual Aid Agreement, was approved by the War Cabinet in May lastf for exploratory and non-committaldiscussion at the official level with the&quot;United, States. Only informal and limitedtalks have as yet taken place in Washington. Recently the American Adminis-tration tabled an alternative scheme for an International Stabilization Eundwhich to a large extent has the same objectives as the British Plan and therehave been preliminary talks about the differences between the two Plans. the clearing Union Plan has been communicated to the other United Nations andwill shortly be published in a slightly revised form. The American Plan hasbeen communicated to other United Nations.but has not yet been published. Itis hoped that there will be a representative meeting of experts of the united nations to discuss post-war monetary arrangements, but no date has as yet beensuggested.2. The International Regulation of Primary Products.  .In the meantime a second Article 7 scheme-f or the International Regulationof Primary Products has been prepared here, and advantage was taken of thedelay in opening more formal discussions with the United States under Article 7to submit both schemes to a conference of Dominion and Indian officials last autumn. The Clearing Union Scheme was generally endorsed; the scheme forthe International Regulation of Primary Products has been amended in some respects and recast in form to meet the views then expressed. The revised formis now before the War Cabinet for approval as a basis of exploratory and non-committal discussion with the United&apos; S&apos;flvEes&quot;(W.Pr *(43j&quot; 97).* W.M.

3. Commercial Policy.The lines to be adopted by this country in discussions on commercial policyunder Article 7 have also been under examination at the official level, and thereports which have been prepared have been considered by meetings of theMinisters concerned under the chairmanship of the Lord President. Steps arenow being taken to ascertain the views of Dominion Governments, and the issues involved will then be submitted to the &quot;War Cabinet by the President of the Boardof Trade.4. Civil Aviation.Lord Finlay&apos;s Report* was submitted to the Reconstruction ProblemsCommittee in December and has been under examination by a sub-committee ofMinisters. An official committee has been working out the main lines of fouralternative proposals, and its report has just been received. The subject was discussed by Ministers with representatives of the Dominions, India andRhodesia on the 25th February, and a further meeting is to be held when thereport of the Official Committee is available, t In the meantime authority has beengiven by the War Cabinet; for work to proceed on the design of new types of aircraft for transport purposes and on the conversion of existing military types.5. International Relief and Rehabilitation.The draft agreement for setting up a United Nations Relief and rehabilitation-tion Administration has been revised in several important respects. The chiefpoint outstanding is that of the enlargement of the Policy Committee from fourt seven members. His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed that the draft shouldbe circulated to the United Nations, and a final decision will be taken by the four powers in the light of the comments received.The Inter-Allied Committee is working to complete a first report to the AlliedGovernments, which will include estimates of essential minimum requirements ofeach Allied country for the first six months after the war, as well as interimreports by Technical Advisory Committees on Medical Supplies and Services,Inland Transport, Nutrition and Agriculture.6. Military Section of the Reconstruction Secretariat.The Military Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Problems Committee,after studying the lessons of past armistices, have drawn up draft heads ofarmistices with Germany and Italy and with Roumania, the latter beingintended to serve as a model for adaptation to other Axis allies of South-east europe. They have also prepared drafts of documents which might be requiredin the event of a breakdown of central government in Germany or Italy or of a collapse of Italy before Germany. The Sub-Committee is also collaboratingwith other Departments on a number of post-war problems, including :- (a) Proposals for the occupation of Germany, Italy and South-East Europeby the United Nations.(b) The setting-up and organisation of an Armistice Commission and its relation to the Supreme Command.(c) The disarmament of Germany including industrial disarmament.(d) Atlantic and West European security.(e) Middle East and Mediterranean post-war questions.II. Home Affairs.7. Machinery of Government.Following a War Cabinet decision on the 24th August lastg the following ministers have been invited by the Prime Minister1&apos; To consider the machinery of government and to report what changesin the organisation and functions of the Central Executive are desirableto promote efficiency under post-war conditions.&quot;The Lord President of the Council (Chairman).The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Lord Chancellor.

The Committee decided at their first meeting that certain subjects within their-terms of reference should be referred for preliminary study on their behalfto a group of senior officials. This group will direct studies to be undertaken on particular topics and will report the results to the Ministerial Committee.In the narrower field of Civil Service organisation following on theSixteenth Report of the Select Committee on National Expenditure^- theChancellor of the Exchequer announced in the House of Commons on the16th March the appointment of a Committee, under the Chairmanship of theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury,&quot;To examine the general question of the training of civil servants,including the question whether a Staff College should be established andif so, the particular form and character which that college should take.&quot;Another Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Alan Barlow is con-sidering the conditions of service of Government scientific employees.8. Committee on Reconstruction Priorities.On the 14th January the War cabinet &apos;*&apos; decided that consideration of the beveridge Plan, together with the general review of other substantial claims to financial assistance, set out in the Chancellor of the Exchequers Paper(R.P. (43) 5), should be remitted to a Committee constituted as follows : -The Lord President of the Council (Chairman).The Minister of Labour and National Service.The Minister of Production.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Lord Privy Seal.The Minister without Portfolio.&quot;Other Ministers to be associated with the work of the Committee and to attend,when matters affecting their interests were under discussion.9. The Beveridge Plan.Statements of the Governments policy in regard to various parts of thePlan were made in Parliament during the Debate on the 16th-18th Februaryin accordance with the decisions of the War Cabinet. :j: The respective Depart-,ments have each been given the responsibility of working out those parts of thePlan that fall within the sphere of their present administration and a smallcentral staff has been set up to deal with those parts which are not the concern of any existing Department, e.g., Children&apos;s Allowances, and to arrange for theco-ordinated development of other parts of the Plan which concern a numberof different Departments. This central staff (with Mr. T. H. Sheepshanks, atpresent Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Home Security, in charge) is underthe immediate control of the Minister without Portfolio and subject to thegeneral direction of the Committee on Reconstruction Priorities.10. A Comprehensive Health Service.The announcement of the Government&apos;s decision to proceed. with thepreparation of a comprehensive health service -broadly on the lines of the second of the three Beveridge Assumptions has enabled the Health Departments (whichhad already done much preliminary work in this field) to enter upon definitediscussions with the various interests concerned-medical organisations, voluntary hospitals and local authorities covering the whole field of hospital, consultantand general practitioner service. (In Scotland, a committee Chairman,Sir Hector Hetherington has already been appointed to consider the arrange-ments necessary for the development of a comprehensive and co-ordinatedhospital service.)After covering all the main grounds with the interests, chiefly involved, itis hoped to reach a position in, say, two or three months, in which a general andfairly full statement of the intended scheme could be published as a White Paper,with an explanation that this represents the likely and practicable way of creatingthe new service as the Government sees it, aft&amp;r consulting those professional ant-other organisations most directly affected.   This sort of publication, proper-* H.C. Paper 120.f W.M. (43) 8th Conclusions, Minute 3.$ W.M. (43) 28th Conclusions.[25190] b 2
timed, would afford a good preliminary test of public opinion and give an oppor-tunity for criticism to interests that had not previously been heard. This would facilitate the next stage, which must be to review and prepare the detailedcontents of draft legislation. Throughout these present consultations and proceedings the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland arekeeping closely in step.11. Future Procedure of the Reconstruction Priorities Committee.The Committee made an Interim Report to the &quot;War Cabinet on the BeveridgePlan* and, as stated in paragraph 9 above, they will exercise a general supervision over the work of the Departments and the central staff charged with the duty ofworking out the details of a comprehensive scheme of social insurance.Before proceeding with their second task of reviewing other reconstructionprojects involving substantial claims to financial assistance, the Committee pro-pose to examine the probable national income, rate of investment and expenditurein the period immediately following the war and the probable budgetary positionin that period. For this purpose a Paper has been prepared by the Treasury onthe continuance of the stabilisation policy; and a memorandum will shortly beavailable reviewing various proposals for maintaining full employment after thewar. These studies, together with those projected on the national income, invest-ment and expenditure, will provide a proper perspective for the Committee&apos;sreview of reconstruction priorities.12. Education.In December last the President of the Board of Education submitted an outline of his proposals for educational reform to the Lord Presidents Committee(L.P. (42) 277). After a full discussion the committee invited the President toproceed with the formulation of specific proposals for legislation, embodyingthese for convenience in the form of a draft Bill for consideration bythe War Cabinet along with a further report on financial and other points raised in the discussion. Various aspects of Scottish Education are being examined bythe Scottish Advisory Council on Education and a separate Committee hasbeen appointed to advise on problems connected with school building afterthe war.13. Demobilisation and Resettlement of Labour.In accordance with the Cabinet decision of the 19th November, 19424progress has been made on a number of matters dealt with in W.P. (42) 498.(a) Post-War Training and Entry into the Building Industry.After negotiation with the interests concerned the Governments proposals have now been formulated and published as a White Paper (Cmd. 6428). they provide for the expansion of the building labour force to 1,250,000 to meet theestimated requirements of a ten to twelve years&apos; construction programme, forwhich purpose there will be arrangements for the special training of 200,000 menin the immediate post-war years, in addition to comprehensive apprentice trainingon normal lines. The proposals have been well received and action is now pro-ceeding to set up the Headquarters Organisation under the Ministry of Labourand National Service to deal with special training. At the same time the Ministryof Works is establishing the Training and Apprenticeship Council to deal with normal training.(b) Rehabilitation and Resettlement of Disabled Persons.The Interdepartmental Committee under the Joint Parliamentary Secretaryto the Minister of Labour and National Service has presented its report(Cmd. 6415) on a comprehensive post-war scheme for the rehabilitation, training and resettlement of disabled persons of all categories. Some of the recommenda-tions involve legislation. The report was considered by the Lord presidents committee on 18th December, 1942, and accepted as a basis for discussion withthe interested bodies. These discussions have been initiated and interdepart-mentai machinery established, as recommended in the report, to supervisepreparations for the introduction of the scheme as soon as possible after the War.* W.P.

(c) Provision for Persons whose Further Education or Training has been prevented or Interrupted by War Service.The further report of the Interdepartmental Committee on the FurtherEducatioin of Demobilised Members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces and of Others isabout to be presented. Its main proposals (which have been approved by Ministers)provide for State assistance to enable suitably qualified men and women, on demobilisation from war service, to undertake or continue further education or training above the secondary school level.In addition, consideration is being given to the provision by the service departments of corresponding opportunities for further education and training for men and women retained in tie Armed Forces after the War.Committees under Lord Hankey are being appointed : &apos;(1) To ensure that the educational and training arrangements are closely &apos;related to the prospects of employment at home and abroad and tosecure co-ordination between the facilities to be provided outside andinside the Services; and(2) to advise the Ministry of Labour and National Service on the organisa-tion of the work of the Appointments Department of the Ministry inassisting persons with qualifications for higher posts in the professions,industries and commerce to find opportunities for suitable employmentduring the period of resettlement after the War.It has been agreed that the general nature of the arrangements proposed should be made public as soon as possible, and a statement will shortly be madein the House of Commons.(d) Oversea Settlement on Demobilisation.An Interdepartmental Committee under the Chairmanship of the Parlia-mentary Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs has reported* in favourof the grant in approved cases of free passages with a view to settlementoverseas of demobilised members of the Forces and their dependants. Therecommendations of the Committee have been approved by the reconstruction problems Committee.t14. The Resettlement of Industry.(a) Arrangements have been made in the Board of Trade to establish a close co-ordination between the reconstruction section of the Department and the staff engaged in the Board of Trade and the Supply Departments on war-time controlof industry, and an approach is being made to all the consumer goods industries for which the Board is primarily responsible. A sub-committee of the official committee on Internal Economic Problems, comprising the Board of Trade andthe Supply Departments, is considering the termination of war contracts and thepost-war use and disposal of Government factories, plant, &amp;c. After consultationwith the Ministry of Labour and the Treasury, they are consulting the engineering and Allied Industries with a view to the preparation of a plan for their transition from war production.to their peace establishment. It is hoped to indicate thedesirable and practicable size of these industries in terms of labour force and the degree to which Government factories and machine tools can be absorbed intopeace production.(b) Export Trade. The Post-War Export Trade Committee, presided overby the Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade, is expected to submit areport about the end of April; concurrently the Department is discussing post-war export problems with the main representative organisations of export industries.15. Food Policy.The Ministry of Food has been studying a variety of post-war problems,most of which fall within one or other of the following groups : (a) long-term problems of food supply and distribution, with a view to the development of a positive nutrition policy for the more distant post-war period; (b) short-term problems, arising more particularly from the expected continuance of shortageof supplies in the early post-war period.* R.P. (48) 11.f R.P. (43) 3rd Meeting, Minute 1.!&quot;25190] b 3
16. A agricultural Policy.A memorandum by the two Agricultural Departments on agricultural policy was submitted by the Official Committee on Internal Economic Problems to theCommittee on Reconstruction Problems in January last with a recommendation that it should be adopted as the basis of exploratory discussions with the industryin this country and with Governments overseas. This memorandum (W.P. (43)103) now awaits consideration by the War Cabinet.17. A agricultural Education.The Committee appointed by the Minister of Agriculture under the Chair-manship of Mr. Justice Luxmoore, &quot; to examine the present system of agricultural education and to make recommendations for improving and developing it afterthe war,&quot; has presented its report and this is now under consideration;18. Forestry.Far-reaching proposals in regard to post-war forestry were submitted to theReconstruction Problems Committee in November last by the present minister without Portfolio^ and an assurance of the Governments recognition of the needfor an energetic post-war policy in this field was given by him in the course of his general statement on reconstruction in the House of Commons on the 1st december last. These and other proposals have been worked out in greater detail and withsome variations by the Forestry Commission in a comprehensive report on Post-War Forestry Policy recently received. Before deciding on the publication ofthis report Ministers more directly concerned have remitted it for examination bythe Official Committee on Internal Economic Problems, except in so far as it relates to the constitution of the future Forest Authority, on which reference isbeing made to the Committee on the Machinery of Government.19. Public Utilities.(a) Electricity. Outline proposals for a comprehensive reorganisation ofthe system of generation and distribution of electricity in this country have beenprepared by the Minister without Portfoliot with the collaboration of theMinister of Supply and are under examination by a special sub-committee ofthe Reconstruction Problems Committee.The Hydro-Electric Development (Scotland) Bill which gives effect to recommendations- of Lord Cooper&apos;s Committee in regard to hydro-electricdevelopment in Scotland has been read a second time in the House of Commons.(b) Gas. At the request of the Minister of Fuel and Power the gas industry has set up a committee to consider its post-war problems. The com-mittee is expected to report during the summer.(c) Inland Transport - Far-reaching proposals for the post-war organisa-tion of all forms of internal transport have been submitted by Dr. W. H. Coates(of Imperial Chemical Industries) in a report to the Ministry of War Transport.This is now under examination in the Ministry.(d) Water. The Minister of Health is in touch with the British Water-works Association and Local Authority Associations with a view to there introduction of the Water Undertakings Bill of 1939 in the form in which itwas passed by the Lords after examination by a Select Committee of bothHouses. The Bill seeks to consolidate and simplify existing legislation and procedure preparatory to the consideration of major recommendations of policyof the Central Advisory Committee on Water.In Scotland arrangements have been made to carry out a survey of watersupply and drainage services to find out how far these services could be improved by combining existing resources or by promoting new schemes.20. Post-War Building and Construction.The Minister of Works has established a special section for the collection and collation of information in regard to post-war building and constructionneeds, including arrears of maintenance, repair of war damage as well as new construction, with a view to effective co-ordination of requirements, in duepriority, with the supplies of labour, materials and capital likely to be available.The Ministry is co-operating with the Ministry of Labour and National service in the scheme to increase the man-power of the industry, to which reference hasalready been made; plans are being laid to secure as far as practicable an* B.P. (42) 39.f R.P. (42) 37.
adequate supply of building materials for post-war needs and, as regardsmaterials likely to be in short supply, special attention is being given to economy in their use by suitable modifications of design and the introduction of alternativematerials. As regards the technique of building generally, the Ministry isco-operating with the industry and other Government Departments in thepreparation of designs, codes and standards of practice, the standardisation of products, &amp;c, in order to ensure the maximum efficiency and economy underpost-war conditions, both in labour and material, compatible with a high standard of design and execution.21. Housing.Much preparatory work is being carried out by the Departments concernedin regard to the future housing programme. An interdepartmental technical committee is investigating new methods of housing construction. A Sub-Committee of the Central Housing Advisory Committee for England and wales have presented an interim report on rural cottage plans which have been used asa basis for the war-time agricultural housing scheme of 3,000 cottages announced in February. Another Sub-Committee are reviewing the whole field of&apos; rural housing and hope to produce a report in September next.Sub-Committees of the corresponding Scottish Housing Advisory Committeeon (a) housing design and lay-out, (b) the furnishing and equipment of localauthority houses, and (c) the measures to be taken to secure the most appropriatedistribution of houses after the war are expected to report within the next three months. The Department of Health for Scotland, in consultation with thefirst mentioned Sub-Committee, have prepared and issued to the local authorities concerned, model plans of the rural houses to be built under the present schemefor agricultural workers.   .A joint memorandum on long-term housing policy has been prepared bythe two Health Departments and been considered by the Official Committeeon Internal Economic Problems.* A decision on the size of the programme and its rate of execution is dependent on the capacity of the industry after the war,the priority to be accorded to new house building in the general construction programme and in the provision of capital, as well as budgetary considerations.In the meantime, local authorities in both countries are being instructed to makepreliminary arrangements as regards the purchase of sites for a first year&apos;programme and their lay-outs.22. Town and Country Planning.The Minister of Town and Country Planning Bill became law on the4th February, 1943, and the new Ministry is engaged on a wide range of activities to give effect to the policy of the Government in England and Wales. A Town and country Planning (Interim Development) Bill has been submitted to theLegislation Committee! after the necessary consultations with Departments andLocal Authority Associations. A Reconstruction Bill is in preparation, butdrafting must await the decisions of the Government on certain of the recommen-dations of the TJthwatt Report. The recommendations relating to theacquisition of development rights are now. under consideration by the Reconstruc-tion Problems Committee, and those relating to extended powers of compulsory purchase, to be exercised by local authorities outside reconstruction areas, are under consideration by a sub-committee of the Official Committee on internal economic Problems. Meanwhile, a good deal of work on the administrative andother questions arising out of these recommendations is being carried on in theDepartment.Steps are being, taken to build up the regional planning organisation of theDepartment and to prepare the necessary maps, pamphlets on planning technique,designs, &amp;e, for the assistance of local planning authorities. Work on local planning schemes had been largely suspended during the war, but as and whentime permits schemes previously submitted, but not yet approved, are now being-examined with a view to any necessary modifications in the light&apos; of presentconditions : the number of such schemes is about 330. Subject to staff being available, local planning authorities are being encouraged to undertake surveys oftheir districts on uniform lines, and progress is being made in the organisationof joint planning authorities. Special attention is being paid to plans for thereconstruction of war-damaged areas.   The Minister is about to appoint a panel* I.E.P. (42) 65.t H.P.C. (43) 46.
of expert advisers to assist the Department in formulating the general principles(including the question of finance) on which the reconstruction of blitzed citycentres should be planned.In Scotland the Secretary of State has taken corresponding action. a scottish Town and Country Planning (Interim Development) Bill is being prepared and the Department of Health for Scotland are associated in theconsideration of the Uthwatt recommendations. Similar administrative steps are being taken to examine suspended schemes, to encourage local planningsurveys, to build up information for local authorities on planning standards andtechnique and generally to prepare for the exercise of the extended planningpowers which the Government have indicated their intention of making available.23. The Scott Report.This is under examination by the numerous Departments concerned underthe general co-ordination of the Official Committee on Internal economic problems. Some of the recommendations fall into major fields of policy already referred to, such as housing, agriculture, forestry, public utilities, &amp;a TheMinistry of Town and Country Planning has commenced a survey of areassuitable for national parks, and a general report, to be followed by detailedfactual reports on the Lake District, Snowdonia and the Peak District, isshortly expected. A survey of the coastline within their respective regions isbeing undertaken under the direction of the Ministry5 s Regional PlanningOfficers, and a general report on the scientific aspects of coastal preservation isbeing prepared. Progress is also being made with a number of specialinvestigations arising out of this report, on such matters as commons andfootpaths, surface minerals, holiday camps, disposal of war factories in rural areas, the removal of temporary defence works, &amp;c. close touch being kept withthe other Departments concerned.The Lord Chancellor has set up a Committee to consider whether it is practicable to give effect at the present time to the Committee&apos;s recommendation in regard to the compulsory registration of title, either generally or in particular areas and by what stages.On the important recommendations relating to the location of industry in country areas a joint memorandum is being prepared for the Official Committeeon Internal Economic Problems by the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Townand Country Planning.The Secretary of State for Scotland has recently set up a Committee(Chairman, Lord Normand) &quot; to review the steps that are being taken inScotland to ensure that the recommendations of the Scott Committee for Englandand Wales, so far as they can be applied to Scottish conditions, are being dulyconsidered, and to advise what further steps, if any, should be taken.&quot; ThisCommittee is about to report.24. Reconstruction Work of Scottish Departments.Most of this work is being carried out under the general guidance of theCouncil of ex-Secretaries of State. In addition to the items already referred to,the Secretary of State has set up Committees on the Hill Sheep-farming industry (Chairman, Lord Balfour of Burleigh) and on Land Settlement(Chairman, Sir John Watson, K.C.). Another Committee under the Chairman-ship of Colonel Walter Elliot has been appointed by the Fishery Ministers to investigate the Herring Industry, and the Solicitor-General for Scotland ispresiding over a Scottish Coalfields Committee. The Scottish Council on industry, an unofficial body set up under the auspices of the Council of ex-Secretaries of State, is investigating the economic prospects and problems of post-war Scotland.25. The Welsh Advisory Council on Post^War Problems.This Council was appointed by-the present Minister without Portfolio onthe 30th June, 1942, &quot; to survey, in conformity with the general examination of reconstruction problems now being conducted by the Government, those problemsof reconstruction which are of special application to Wales and Monmouthshire.&quot;The Council at once proceeded to establish committees on Agriculture, Industry,Education and Youth, Local Government and Transport and Public Utilities.
The work of these committees has. been summarised in two Interim reports submitted by the Council on the 23rd November, 1942, and the 19th March 1943Recommendations are made concerning the Coal Export Trade the&apos; SlateQuarrying, Tinplate and Calcium Carbide Industries, Electricity&apos; ForestryTown and Country Planning, Technical Education and the future of the DualSystem in Welsh education. The Council refer to a suggestion made to them forthe establishment of a Welsh Office with a Secretary for Wales.26.
