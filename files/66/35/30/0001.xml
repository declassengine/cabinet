E. BRIDGES.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,March 30, 1943.Viscount Halifax to Foreign Office.(No. 1470.) Washington, March 28, 1943.FOLLOWING for Prime Minister from Secretary &quot;of State  His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador and I had a comprehensive talk with the Presidentyesterday at which Hull, Winant, Welles and Hopkins were present, We workedthrough an agenda which had been drawn up beforehand.2. The first point raised by the President was the structure of the united nations organisation after the war. His general idea is that there should be three organisations : The first would be a general assembly at which all the united nations would be. represented. This assembly would only meet about once ayear, and its purpose would be to enable representatives of all the smaller Powersto blow off steam. At the other end of the scale would be an executive committee composed of representatives of the Four Powers. This body would take all themore important decisions and wield police powers of the United Nations. Inbetween these two bodies would be an advisory council composed of representativesof the Four Powers and of, say, six or eight other representatives elected on a regional basis, roughly on the basis of population. There might thus be one representative from Scandinavia and Finland and one or two from groups ofLatin American States. This council would meet from time to time as might berequired to settle any international questions that might be brought before it.The chief official of this three-fold United Nations organi sation would be amoderator (the President preferred this title to Secretary-General), who wouldsummon the various United Nations bodies when required and whose expressduty would be to keep in touch with the four members of the executive committee.3.   The President said it was essential to include China among the four powers and to organise all these United Nations organs on a world-wide and not[25228]
upon a regional basis. He made it clear that the only appeal which would belikely to carry weight with the United States public if they were to undertakeinternational responsibilities would be one based upon a world-wide conception.They would be very suspicious of any organisation that was only regional. Wehave strong impression that it is through their feeling for China that thePresident is seeking to lead his people to accept international responsibilities. K;4. The next topic raised was that of international trusteeship for certain areas in the world.  This subject was discussed under three heads in relation to-(1) disputed territories in Europe;(2) colonial territories;(3) intermediate cases like Korea and Pacific Islands.5. Nothing much emerged as regards (1). During the discussion of (2) Iraised the question of Colonial declaration. The position here is that Hull hasintroduced certain amendments into our draft which the President has approved.We gathered that Hulks re-draft does not favour intrusive interference byoutsiders, but he has promised to let me have revised text before I leave.6. Under the third heading there was a long discussion in which the fate of certain Far Eastern and Pacific territories and of certain parts of the French Empire was adumbrated. In the Far East the policy is to be &quot; Japan for theJapanese.&quot; Manchuria and Formosa would be returned to China and SouthernSakhalin to Russia. The Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific would passunder the trusteeship of the United Nations. All other Pacific islands (withthe exception of the two groups mentioned below) would remain under theirpresent sovereignty, British, French or what not, but would have a commoneconomic policy such as is to be set up in the West Indies. The FrenchMarquesas and Tuamotu Islands would pass to the United Nations for userespectively as stages on the northern and southern air routes across the Pacificfrom Caribbean area to Australia and New Zealand. Korea and French Indo-China would pass under international trusteeship; for the former the trusteesmight be the United States, the Soviet Union and China. Timor was mostimportant for Australia and would also have to be dealt with.. I suggested thatif experience of Anglo-French condominium in the New Hebrides was any guide the idea of international administration as opposed to a national administrationeven if under international trusteeship would be a source of difficulties. Itmight be preferable to entrust the control of administration to one trustee. ThePresident said he thought that a good deal will depend upon the personalitiesof the&quot; agents chosen to exercise a .joint trusteeship on the spot. Murphy andMacMillan got on very well together. He suggested in passing that places likeDakar and Bizerta were of the greatest importance for the defence respectivelyof the United States and Mediterranean. His idea was that the United states should, act as policeman for the United Nations at Dakar and Great Britain atBizerta.7. I remarked that the President was being very hard on the French, from whom the strongest opposition was to be expected. He admitted this but saidthat France would no doubt require assistance for which consideration might bethe placing of certain parts of her territory at the disposal of the United Nations.Welles reminded the President that the United States Government had gone on record for the restoration of French possessions. The President said he thoughtthat this referred only to North Africa, but Welles observed that there was nosuch modification. The President said that he thought in the ironing out of things1after the war this kind of position could be rectified.8. As regards Germany the President returned to the idea of dismember- vment, which he was inclined to think would make for the security of Europe. ..)He admitted, that there was some opposition to the idea in Washington and Hullintimated that he himself had been considering the idea and had not yet made up his mind. I said that we had also been studying the question; on the wholeI favoured, the idea of dismemberment as you had often spoken to me in favourof it. The President thought German unity did not go back far in history andthat there might well be a tendency, which should be encouraged, for Germany to,split up into a number of separate entities.9. As regards consideration of political questions connected with militaryoperations, the idea [ ? group omitted : ? was] that civilian representatives ofthe  two  Governments  might  be  associated&quot; with  joint  military   staffs  in
Washington, in North Africa and also in London. The question will be further explored with Welles in connexion with the problem of administration of italian territory (Foreign Office telegram No. 1815).10. In answer to the question whether we should permit any country inEurope to form a dictatorship after the war, the President thought the answer was &quot; No,&quot; but the question really was what we meant by dictatorship. Salazarand South America were in point. He thought that one test might be whetheror not the State constitution contained provision for free elections.11.   We also touched on civil aviation and transport.12. As regards civil aviation, the President thought the main principle should be that no country should own or operate air services within another country although it would be legitimate to provide skilled managerial staff.There should be liberty for aircraft to land on airfields of other countries but not for passengers or goods to be transported by foreign air lines from one airfieldin a foreign country to another. He hoped that when British and Americanexperts had got far enough with their studies they would exchange views with each other and with experts of other Governments concerned and favoured theidea of this being taken up as soon as possible.13. Reference was also made to the situation in those countries like Norwaywhich would have lost the greater part of their merchant shipping by the end ofthe war. Such countries might equitably have their losses largely made up onfavourable terms.   I said that we ourselves were likely to be in this class.14. Hopkins proposed that on these and other technical matters thePresident should authorise the State Department to enter into definite consulta-tions with the other Governments concerned as soon as they were in a positionto do so.   The President seemed to accept this suggestion.15. At the close of the discussion Hopkins said that it was important tobear, in mind three points : firstly, that there should be no attempt to set up a european Council, for this would give free ammunition to isolationists here whowould jump at the chance of sitting back in a similar regional council for theAmerican continent, secondly, that discussions should not have the appearance of an Anglo-American attempt to settle the future of the world, and thirdly, thatin our future policy towards China [group undecypherable: ? interested]exploitation should be excluded.16. On the second point I said that I hoped the United States Governmentwould inform the Soviet Government of their conversations with us.; it was undesirable that reports should be made to Moscow by His Majesty&apos;s government alone.
