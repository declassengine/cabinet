TO BE KEPT UNDER ; 00K- AND&apos;KEY.WffS IDOGUMBNT IS THE PROBHRTY OF HES BRITANNIC MAJESTIES GOTERNMBNT.ensure the secrecy of this document.copy: NO.^&apos;war   CABINET,ADEQUACY OF PROTECTION OF MERCHANT SRTPS IN CONVOY.Memorandum by Minister of Shipping,Memorandum 77,P.(40) 343, ishich drew attention to the anxiety felt inthe Ministry of Shipping at the increase in losses of Merchant Ships9 pointedout that, unless the rate of loss could be substantially reduced, all supply departments must revise their expectations of import supplies, and urged theneed for additional escorts.Losses continue at a rate which is causing me profound disquiet.   In onerecent convoy ten ships with essential and valuable cargo were torpedoed and sunk and several others damaged, including one shelled by a submarine on the surface.   During the same -week 8 or 9 other vessels, sailed in convoy, were torpedoed.The fact that six of these ships were attacked either just before finingor shortly after leaving their escorts suggests strongly the necessity for extending the present range of escorting, so as to make the system a convoysystam in the full sense.The number of ships which are being sunk while in company with theirescorts also shows that the escorting vessels, whether,&quot;by rsason -of theirinadequate numbers pr speed, or othtsr causes, are not at.present ah&amp;eto protect our Merchant Shipping against continued and serious losses.In a matter of this vital importance, remedial, measures should not be delayed and I urge, therefore, that as a first step an immediate increase of effective escorting forces should be arranged.I am aware, of course, that there are many demands, including anti-invasion preparations, made upon our limited naval forces but I should befailing in my duty if I did not represent, in the strongest possible terms,the necessity for putting a stop to the present exorbitant risks to which ourMerchant Shipping is being exposed.I believe that I am in accord with the First Lord of the Admiralty in thinking that .the new organisation, now being developed, for dealing with atlantic convoys, which works in close conjunction with the Coastal and Fighter Commands,and wifeh the Ministry of Shipping, should have concentrated upon it the highest possible degree of responsibility for all functions relative to the protectionof Merchant Shipping from attack by submarine and airoraf.t *The weight of actual imports (apart from Oil, Molasses and Whale Oil) intothe United Kingdom in the first year of the war was a little over 43^ million tons, divisible as followsThe Ministry of Shipping estimated last autumn that the year&apos;s imports would amount to        million tons, and this estimate might have been realisedbut for the collapse of France and its Consequences^ including the increasedshipping losses.In my note of the 1st August on Shipping and Importing Capacity, it wasQabimatsd, upon a number of assumptions set out in the note, that the tonnage available in^the second year of the war might stiff ice to import 42 million tonsESTIMATE OF IMPORTS IN THE SECOND YEAR OF THE WAR.Ministry of supply ministry of Food..Board of Trade....22 million tons20% &quot;1   &quot; &quot;
Of commodities (excluding Oil, Molassea and Tfhale Qil) 3 provided that weretain sufficient use of the ports in the United Kingdom to enable this amount of import to be handled, that neither they nor the ports of loadingbecome unduly congested and that there will be no loss of importing capacityby foreign vessels owing to crew delays and other risks in excess of thosewhich we run with tonnage under our full control,   I pointed out that areduction of IC7&amp; or more upon 42 million tons might well have to be envisage,Since that provisional estimate was made, our losses from all causeshave exceeded the rate of loss which the estimate assumed over the second year of the war.   For the fifteen weeks to the 22nd September, we lost atthe annual rate of 5.^6 million dead-weight tons as compared with the rate  ^of 5.2 million tons assumed in the estimate, without making allowance for   Pvessels sunk in the London Docks during the recent air attacks.Moreover, service requirements have gone up, and now are absorbingmore than the average which I assumed for the year.   Political developmentsarc not making it easier for us to retain the control of Neutral Shipping,The Greek Government, for example, is showing many signs of subservience to italian demands in relation to shipping, which may involve us in delays,if not in actual loss of chartered tonnage,It must also be borne in mind that many of the sources from which wehave been able to obtain additional tonnage in the past year, are shrinking.Captures will be few, opportunities of purchase more restricted, and, ifdamage is done to the yards, the rate of new construction may be even less favourable than   the   one and a half million tons deadweight assumed.Even if we are able to obtain an import in the neighbourhood of 40 million tons in the second year of the war, our position during the third year willbe much weaker.These considerations emphasise the imperative necessity of increasingsubstantially and without delay the protection given to our Mercantile Marine,Ministry of Shipping,30th September, 1940.
