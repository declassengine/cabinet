war CABINET.Committee on Foreign (Allied) Resistance.ECONOMIC PRESSURE ON FRENCH WEST AFRICA.Memorandum.IN spite of the setback at Dakar, we still have in our hands an extremelypowerful economic weapon for use against French West Africa. If this weaponcan be ruthlessly used, its effect should be greatly enhanced a month or two hence,when the new crops begin to come forward. The ports in French West Africaare already full of produce which has been accumulating through lack of markets and shipping facilities. The main Ivory Coast cocoa crop begins to come forward in October, and the groundnut crop (mainly from Senegal and the provinces ofthe interior) about the same time, Unless storage space can be cleared for thesecrops, they will perish on the ground. The effect will be particularly serious inthe case of the groundnut crop, which amounts to half a million tons and which comes forward extremely rapidly. There is also a large all-the-year-roundproduction of palm kernels, as well as other smaller seasonal crops such as coffee.If things go on as at present, the position by the end of the year will be chaotic.Moreover, French West Africa is already short of essential import commodities,the most important of which is mineral oil, of which we have evidence that thereis a shortage in Metropolitan France. In Senegal and French Guinea food rationing has already been introduced, and transport and public services havebeen reduced to the barest minimum for lack of petrol and fuel oil. The localadministrations depend almost entirely for their revenues on customs duties,which, in the absence of inward and outward trade through the ports, willpractically disappear. The natives will probably be able to mitigate their plightby reversion to a subsistence economy, but the condition of the European communitywill be desperate.2. If by rigorous economic pressure we can reverse the decision of Dakar, weshall have achieved an outstanding success. The exact policy which might be pursued may be divided under three heads :  (i) Assistance to French Equatorial Africa and the Cameroons.   special care should be taken to see that this is prompt and effective. Extensivemeasures have already been taken and the position is at the momentwell in hand, but it will be constantly watched.(ii) Pressure on French West Africa.   As near as possible this should be complete.(iii) Economic  propaganda  to  French  West  Africa.    This  should  beredoubled. . Every opportunity should be taken to point out theadvantages accruing to the neighbouring territories which have joined General de Gaulle, and to drive home the point that FrenchWest Africa owes its plight to the fact that its Government repudiated&quot;General de Gaulle and fired on him, when he came with immediatesupplies and with plans, already agreed with His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, for generous economic help. Besides being transmitted by theB.B.C., our propaganda should be communicated to the British west african Colonial Governors for use by any means possible.3. Such a policy might be very effective in undermining the present FrenchWest African attitude, but its success depends entirely on (ii) in the preceding paragraph. Unless we can effectively throttle the maritime trade of the territory,our propaganda will be worse than useless, because it will be contradicted by
events. Hitherto we have succeeded in achieving this object, but we will almost certainly have to face more determined counter-activity in the future. Suchcounter-activity may take either or both of two forms :  (i) efforts to trade with foreign countries, particularly those in the american continent;(ii) efforts to trade with Metropolitan France.It is not believed that any great difficulty will be experienced in regard to (i). Ascheme has been devised whereby trade between neutral countries and certain specified French Colonies, including French West Africa, may be prevented or atleast reduced to small dimensions by administrative measures, and withoutdeclaring these colonies enemy territory. Certain details of the scheme have yet to be settled, but it has been approved in principle by all the Departmentsconcerned.(ii) Presents greater difficulty. The trade would be carried in French (i.e.,technically enemy) ships, and these would be liable to seizure on the high seas. Butthe ships would doubtless be escorted, and to attack these would amount to an act of war. The French have already adopted the practice of passing vessels with small &quot; token &quot; escorts through the Straits of Gibraltar, and our present policy isnot to interfere with French ships if escorted. This policy will dearly have to be altered if the plan outlined in the preceding paragraphs is to be put into effect.The amount of trade between French West Africa and France will probably be small, and will certainly be quite inadequate to carry the bulk of the French west african crops, but it will be sufficient to jeopardise the effect of our pressure andto provide embarrassing counter-propaganda.4.   Two points require decision : (i) Is the Navy capable of intercepting such ships or convoys, or at least asufficient number of them to discourage the trade ?(ii) Is His Majesty&apos;s Government prepared to authorise the Admiralty toact accordingly ?A very early decision on both points is requested, since it is obviously desirablethat the plan outlined above should be put into force at the earliest possible moment.[Note. If the answers to both questions in paragraph 4 above are in the affirmative, it will be possible virtually to stop all trade with French West Africawithout declaring it enemy territory. Such a declaration may be desirable on other grounds, but would not materially affect the present issue. ]Gwydyr House, September 29, 1940.
