KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.DESPATCH OF AIRCRAFT TO THE MIDDLE EAST.Memorandum by the Chairman of the Ministerial Committee on Military Policyin the Middle East.THE Ministerial Committee on Military Policy in the Middle East have had under consideration the question of sending further aircraft to the Middle East.They have received from the Air Ministry a full statement of the relativestrengths and dispositions of the British and Italian Air Forces in that area.From a study of this, they are impressed with our numerical inferiority and thehigh proportion of obsolescent types of aircraft in service.They have reached the conclusion that the despatch of additional airreplacements, at least on the scale at present planned by the Air Ministry, isvitally important, and that even this accession of strength will still leave our air Forces in a position of dangerous inferiority. They wish to emphasise thatthe relatively small numbers of modern aircraft proposed to be sent to the middle east will have an effect in that area out of all proportion to the comparatively small loss occasioned by their withdrawal from the United Kingdom;A. E.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,September 26, 1940.
