Morale. The slight improvement in discipline and morale previously reported has been maintained. No great change for the better is likely until theForce is more actively employed.3. Morale in the submarine Rubis is reported as &quot;very good indeed &quot; inspite of gument about pay.    The visit of Vice-Admiral (S) to presentdecorations to Rubis was greatly appreciated.4.   Causes of Discontent. (a) It is reported that dissatisfaction is likelyto arise if the present limited supplies of &quot; vin ordinaire &quot; become exhausted.[21746] b

Morale and Discipline.-Fairly good and with a tendency to improve.The following points are from a Portsmouth report :  (a) There is some respect for General de Gaulle, but none for Admiral Muselier or the Free French Navy.(b) Attitude to Vichy Government is one of indifference.(c) R.N.
