ACTION IN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS DURING AIR RAIDS,THE PRIME MINISTER said that lie had had several letters drawing attention to the unsatisfactory state of the present arrangements in Government Officesduring air raid warnings.      Lord Tronchard complained that it was three hours before he could get on to the WarOffice by telephone.     Lord Beaverbrook had pointed outthat whereas munition workers were being urged to remain atwork during air attack. Civil Servants were instructed totake shelter in the basement as soon as there was the slightest danger.     We had been subjected to air attack in London for a week and there had not been a singlecasualty in a Government Office, nor would there have beenif everyone had remained at&apos;work in their ordinary rooms..Such a situation might not continue but it vras clearlynecessary to arrive at a reasonable solution which, onthe one hand, would enable the work to proceed and on theother, prevent serious casualties in the event of a heavy attack.      The problem was not confined to Government Officesbut there was also the question of v/hat Parliament should doand whether their meetings should be advertised in advance and whether any special protection could be afforded totheir meetings.      Considerable discussions ensued on thesematters, and the Prime Minister invited the Chiefs ofStaff:-(a) to furnish him with their opinion as to theconditions under which Parliament should meet,having regard to the danger from air attack and the difficulty of giving special protection;(b) to give further consideration to the action tobe taken by Government Departments during air raidsand to express their views as to the suitability ofa solution based on the following principles;(i)    the number of people employed in departments in London to be reduced to a minimum;(ii)    work to be carried on and not to be interruptedexcept under conditions of exceptional danger.&quot;Business as Usual&quot; and not &quot;Safety First1&apos;should be the governing principle&apos;^ to be aimed at;(iii)    the normal telephone service to be at all times operative;(iv)    no obstacle to be placed in the way of move-ment on legitimate business;(v)    a central system of responsible roof-watchersto be established and arrangements to be made .to furnish them with information as to thescale of attack.
