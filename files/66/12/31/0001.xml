(40)393,)During the last few weeks I have been seriously disturbed by the extent of our food losses at sea,      I have no reason tothink that these are out of proportion with the losses of otherimports but if our food supplies are to continue to suffer losses of the order which they have sustained in the last few weeks II shall be bound, very shortly,  to urge the War Cabinet to re-consider the existing Import programmes for the second year ofwar with a view to the provision of a larger proportion of theshipping available for food with,  of course, a consequentialreduction in the tonnage available for other essential requirements.The attacks which are being made at the present time,principally upon London and Liverpool, make it most undesirable to impose any further restrictions on consumption.     Moreover,the extent to which further restrictions could be imposed with-out running a serious risk to public health and morale is extremely small.      In these.circumstances I hope that the WarCabinet will see its way to take action on the lines suggestedby the Minister of Shipping with a view to ensuring that a.larger proportion of our food supplies purchased in overseas countriesactually arrive in the United Kingdom than has been the caseduring the last few weeks.(Intld.)
