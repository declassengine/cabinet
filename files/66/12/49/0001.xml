L. N. NEWALL.J. G. DILL.T. S. V. PHILLIPS(V.C.N.S.).Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.October 14, 1940.Enclosure.Memorandum by the Chief of the Air Staff.IN C.O.S. (40) 817, dated the 10th October, 1940, the Prime Ministerinstructed the Chiefs of Staff to consider certain representations by the ministerial Committee on Military Policy in the Middle East for the immediatestrengthening of the air forces in that theatre.2. In his covering minute the Prime Minister points out that these recom-mendations must take account of the fact that we are still vastly inferior in numbers, both of Fighters and Bombers, to the German Air Force, at home, andthat heavy losses have been sustained by our air production. The present positionis that we are still short in the Fighter Command of 17 Squadrons on the targetI       programme of 85 squadrons for the air defence of Great Britain.3. The strength of Bomber Command is still quite inadequate to meeteffectively the many demands upon it, and numerically our bomber reserves arelamentably inferior to those of the enemy. There are still substantial deficienciesof crews even on the present establishment.4. It is clear, however, that our recent successful air operations at home,combined with the approach of winter, will cause, to some extent, the threat of invasion of this country to recede.   Moreover, in recent weeks it has become[21819]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1940.SECRET. /W.P. (40) 419.(Also CCS.

increasingly evident that the strategical pendulum is swinging towards theMiddle East. In fact, from the latest indications of Axis moves south-eastwards, we are justified in assuming that a most serious danger is alreadydeveloping in the Middle Eastern theatre.5. The Air Staff have made considerable pi^ogress already with their plans for reinforcing the Middle East, and had it been possible to carry out to timethe programme of reinforcement which the Air Staff had set themselves, thestrength of the Air Forces in the Middle East would have been substantially greater than it now is. There is, however, no easy way of rapid reinforcement ofthe Middle East by air. The air route via Malta is precarious and is liable notonly to interference by the enemy, but to long periods of interruption throughadverse weather. Although the route via Takoradi is now in operation,reinforcements by that route must take time. Moreover, any strengthening ofthe air force overseas is not only a matter of sending out aircraft and crews.Air reinforcements must always be supported by maintenance personnel andequipment which, in the main, has to be transferred by sea; and this means atime lag of about 3 months between a decision to despatch reinforcements andtheir establishment in the Middle East complete with their essential groundechelons.6. Bearing these factors in mind, the Air Staff have reviewed the variousmeans by which they can effect the most rapid reinforcement of the air forcestrength in the Middle East and Malta. They have reached the conclusion thatthere are two immediate methods by which the strength and efficiency of the forcescan be increased.Re-equipment.7. The first and most immediate means of strengthening our air effort inthe Middle East is to expedite the re-equipment of existing squadrons with modern and more powerful types. This in itself will add materially to our air strength in that theatre. A large programme of re-equipment to replace obsoletetypes of aircraft in the existing Squadrons has been prepared and is in progress.The first step is to accelerate this programme and the following are the detailed proposals :  (i) 227 Mohawk fighters and 218 Glenn Martin bombers have been allocated to the R.A.F. in the Middle East and the S.A.A.F. for there-equipment of fighter and bomber squadrons still on obsolete types.The Air Ministry, in conjunction with the Ministry of aircraft production, will make every effort to accelerate the delivery of these aircraft.Note. Among the squadrons to be re-equipped with the Mohawksand Glenn Martins are the following South African squadrons : (a) Two Fighter Squadrons to be equipped with Mohawks.   (OneS.A.A.F. Squadron is already in process of re-equipmentwith Hurricanes.)(b) Three Bomber Squadrons to be re-equipped with GlennMartins.In addition, there are four additional squadrons due to form in SouthAfrica, for which the programme of equipment has yet to be decided.(ii) All possible steps will be taken to speed up the delivery direct from theUnited States of the unit ground equipment required to enable the squadrons due to be equipped with American types to operate,(iii) The two existing squadrons of Bomber Transport are being re-equippedas heavy bomber squadrons.    The delivery of Wellingtons for thispurpose will be accelerated as follows :  There are 10 Wellingtons in Middle East now, and 13 more are due to go out this month. It is proposed to arrange for 10 additionalWellingtons to be sent as soon as possible. These reinforcementswill be sent as soon as possible and, when complete, they will providefor the full strength of two Wellington squadrons at 12 I.E., each with some reserve aircraft.
Expansion,8. The second method for increasing rapidly the strength of the existingforces is to expand the first-line strength of the present squadrons, thus saving on the overhead establishments and reducing the delays inevitable in sending out complete new units. The present establishment of the bomber squadrons inthe Middle East is 12 I.E. aircraft. The policy already is to increase theestablishment of these squadrons to 16 I.E. aircraft, thus bringing them into line with home establishments. It is proposed that this change should now be under-taken as early as possible, and the following are the details proposed : (a) Middle East.(i) Increase the existing bomber squadrons from 12 to 16 I.E.   This will affect the two Wellington Heavy Bomber Squadrons and twelvemedium bomber squadrons resulting in an addition to the front lineof 56 I.E. aircraft.(ii) Concurrently it is proposed to approach the South African authorities with a view to raising the strength of their three medium bomber squadrons also from 12 to 16 I.E.Note. The foregoing amounts to an addition equivalent to more than four squadrons to the bomber strength now available in the middle east area.(iii) The strength of the British fighter squadrons in the Middle East isalready established at 16 I.E. aircraft whereas the three South Africansquadrons are still established at 12 I.E. It is proposed to suggest to the South African authorities that they should raise the strengthof their three fighter squadrons from 12 to 16 I.E.(iv) In connexion with the strengthening of the Bomber and Fighter Units,it is proposed also to bring the two General Reconnaissance (FlyingBoat) Squadrons up to their full establishment of 6 I.E. -j- 3 Lit.Sunderlands as soon as the P.B.Ys. are available from the Americanorders to re-equip Coastal Command squadrons.(b) Malta.(i) The existing flight of Hurricanes is to be increased to the strength of afull squadron of 16 I.E. with appropriate reserves. This will involve an additional 12 aircraft being sent out and arrangements for this arealready in hand.(ii) The existing Glenn Martin Unit is to be brought up to the strength ofa full flight of 1 I.E. and 5 LB., involving the addition of 6 aircraft,for which arrangements are also in hand.A additional Squadrons.9. Apart from these two immediate measures, there is the question ofincreasing the existing strength by adding complete new squadrons. Any suchaddition requires not only the full establishment of aircraft, crews, ground equipment and personnel being sent out, but also of the specialised and technical,vehicles to enable the squadrons and the requisite ancillary units to be fullymobile for their operational duties. It has already been agreed between the air and General Staffs that a force amounting to eleven squadrons should be organised on a mobile basis by the Spring of next year, to be ready to co-operate with the Army in an overseas expedition. The Air Ministry will do their utmost to fulfil that agreement. But there are certain serious deficiencies, notably in technical vehicles. And if additional squadrons are to be formed and despatched to the Middle East, it may well involve delay in bringing squadrons at home up to a mobile establishment, and the Air Staff wish it to be recognisedthat this conflict of requirements must be accepted. Indeed, it must be clearthat any accretion of strength in the Middle East can only be at the expense ofthe Metropolitan Air Force.10. In view of these competing requirements at home and in other theatresin certain essential classes of material and personnel at the present time, it is
not possible to make any definite proposals for the addition of new squadrons inthe Middle East without a very thorough examination of all the implicationsinvolved. The Air Staff regard the two foregoing measures re-equipment and expansion by increasing the first-line strength of the existing squadrons as theonly practicable means at their disposal for an immediate strengthening of theair forces in the Middle East. They are, however, already investigating thepossibility of raising three new fighter squadrons in the near future, using certainexisting fighter flights and improvised units as cadres upon which to build. they hope to gain some valuable assistance in this direction from the offer of theSouth African authorities to release pilots, which has recently been made byGeneral Smuts.11. Apart from these additional squadrons, the total reinforcements whichit is hoped to despatch under the foregoing proposals amount to the equivalent of about six squadrons, equipped with aircraft of superior fighting value to themajority of those now in the Middle East. It must be understood, however, thatthis programme cannot, owing to shipping and other difficulties, be realisedimmediately, and its completion must be a matter of some time.(Signed) C. L. N.
