WAR     C A-B dfN S l(13th October, 19^0THE BLOCKADE AND EggTOH T/SST AFRICA. - &apos;   . :Memorandum by the. First Lord of the Admiralty.I liaye considered the paper.by - the.Minister of Economic Warfareon the BlockaoLe and French West Africa.     I think it should be noted thatthe French West African export figures he quotes cover the whole of the year1938 and that the immediate problem to be faced must,, in . respect of someof the commodities, be of a smaller character.     Obviously we are all .agreed that it is important to prevent any substantial part of this producefalling into the. hands of the enemy.     The question is how this can best bedone in relation to our general strategical problems,        ...... ....   ......,2,,   f-.      I feel that what v/e must aim at is to knock Italy out of the Axisas soon as possible and at the same time avoid, if we can, the full &apos;entry of France into the Axis.     If we are to achieve the first of these, it is vital that we should strengthen Malta, re-inforce the Eastern mediterranean fleet and the. forces under the Command of the G-, 0. C. Middle East.     Thebulk of our efforts must be applied in this direction, until at any   ratewe have carried out our special operation for putting through re-inforcementsthrough the Mediterranean to Malta and the Middle East.   . If      &quot;the meantime,by negotiation supplies of West African products to unoccupied France couldbe successfully rationed through the re-establishment of the ConsularService in French Colonial ports and the use of Navic erts, the fearsexpressed by the Minister of Economic Warfare. -would certainly be very much reduced. . ....3. The Naval staff are concerned to secure that, with the strain upon our existing naval strength occasioned by (a) Threat of invasion (b) AutiU Boat measures (c) Growing requirements of convoys of militaryre-inforcements and supplies and (d) naval re-re-inforcement of the mediterranean fleet/
Fleet, ire should avoid any additional calls, on our naval forces,unless absolutely necessary.     They further -stress the importanceof the naval argument already submitted in i/,P. (4-0) 396&quot; and add that if the Vichy Government attacks Gibraltar,, the only effectivereply is to bomb Vichy itself,4. If the War Cabinet- adopt-the submission in      1.paragraph 8 of the Minister^ paper, namely that we must nowenforce the stoppage of trade to and. from&quot; Y/est African&apos;ports, theAdmiralty would do its&quot; best with such forces as can be spared in face of the coming operations through the Mediterranean, but Ishould have thought that, as.it is unlikely that very largequantities of produce can be moved during the period of the .negotiations now proceeding, it would be better to act for the ,..time being in accordance with the Cabinet decision ittV,M.
