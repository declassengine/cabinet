THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT1Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1940.SECRET.W.P. (40) 416.October 15, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.PRIORITIES.Note by the Prime Minister.THE very highest priority in personnel and material should be assigned towhat may be called the Radio sphere. This demands Scientists, Wireless Experts,and many classes of highly-skilled labour and high-grade material. On theprogress made, much of the winning of the war and our future strategy, especiallyNaval, depends. We must impart a far greater accuracy to the A.A. guns, anda far better protection to our warships and harbours. Not only research andexperiments, but production must be pushed hopefully forward from many directions, and after repeated disappointments we shall achieve success.2. The 1A priority must remain with Aircraft Production, for the purposeof executing approved Target programmes. It must be an obligation upon themto contrive by every conceivable means not to let this priority be abused and need-lessly hamper other vital Departments. For this purpose they should specifytheir requirements in labour and material beforehand Quarter by Quarter, or if practicable, month by month, and make all surplus available for othersimmediately. The priority is not to be exercised in the sense that Aircraft Pro-duction is completely to monopolise the supplies of any limited commodity. Wherethe condition prevails that the approved MAP. demands absorb the totjfihsupply,a special allocation must be made, even at prejudice to Aircraft Production, toprovide the minimum essential needs of other Departments or Branches. Thisallocation, if not agreed, will be decided on the Cabinet level.3. At present we are aiming at 5 Armoured Divisions, and ArmouredBrigades equivalent to 3 more.  This is not enough.   We cannot hope to compete[21822]Copy No.
with the enemy in numbers of men, and must therefore rely upon an exceptionalproportion of armoured fighting vehicles. Ten Armoured Divisions is the targetto aim for to the end of 1941. For this purpose the Army must searchinglyreview their demands for mechanized transport, and large purchases of M.T.must be made in the United States. The Home Army, working in this smallIsland with highly-developed communications of all kinds, cannot enjoy the sames cale of transport which Divisions on foreign service require. Improvisationand makeshift must be their guides. A Staff Officer renders no service to thecountry who aims at ideal standards, and thereafter simply adds and multipliesuntil impossible totals are reached. A report should be furnished of M.T., 1st,2nd and 3rd Line of British Divisions (a) For Foreign Service,(b) For Home Service,(c) For troops on the beaches.Any attempt to make heavy weather out of this problem is a failure to aid usin our need.Wherever possible in England, horse transport should be used to supplementM.T. We improvidently sold a great many of our horses to the Germans, butthere are still a good many in Ireland.4. Special aid and occasional temporary priorities must be given to theLaggard elements.  Among these stand out the following :  (a) Rifles.(b) Small Arms Ammunition, above all the special types.Intense efforts must be made to bring the new factories into production. Thefact that scarcely any improvement is now expected until the end of the year,i.e., 16 months after the outbreak of war, is a grave reflection on those concerned.Twelve months should suffice for a cartridge factory. We have been mercifullyspared from the worst consequences of this failure through the Armies not being in action as was anticipated.Trench mortar ammunition and A.T. gun ammunition ai&apos;e also in a shockingplight, and must be helped.All these Laggards must be the subject of weekly reports to the production council and to me.5. The Navy must exercise its existing priorities in respect of small craft and Anti-U-Boat building. This applies also to merchant shipbuilding, and tocraft for landing operations. Delay must be accepted upon all larger vesselsthat cannot finish in 1941. Plans must be made to go forward with all processes and parts which do not clash with prior needs. The utmost possible steel andarmour-plate must be ordered in America.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,October 15, 1940.
