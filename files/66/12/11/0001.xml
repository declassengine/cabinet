naval SITUATION.General Review.The movement of enemy barges and shipping along the Dutch, Belgian andFrench Channel coasts, and the activity in the ports, indicative of preparations for invasion, has continued. On this account some re-disposition of naval forcesin Home Waters has taken place including the stationing of heavy ships atRosyth and Plymouth.Sinkings by U-boats and aircraft have continued to be on a reduced scale.A force of French cruisers and destroyers from Toulon is operating in theEastern Atlantic, with what object it is not clear.British naval forces have been active in the Eastern Mediterranean.Further reports of enemy raiders in the neighbourhood of St. Helena andMadagascar have been received.Home Waters.2. Special anti-invasion patrols by destroyers have been carried out at nightoff our southern coast and in the Straits of Dover. Two submarines have alsobeen on patrol between Havre and Cherbourg.On the night of the 12th/13th sweeps by destroyers were carried out along the coast of Brittany, between Boulogne and Cape Gris Nez and between CapeBarflem and Le Havre. The force off Cape Gris Nez came under fire from enemyshore batteries but was not hit.   No contact was made with enemy ships.3. On the 14th H.M.S. Dundee, while acting as escort to a convoy fromFlalifax, was torpedoed about 240 miles west of the Hebrides. She was taken into by H.M. Canadian Destroyer St. Laurent but sank on the 15th. casualties were 6 officers and 6 ratings killed.During the night of the 17th/18th H.M.S. Stissecc which was completing arefit in the Clyde and was lying alongside at the time, was hit by a bomb duringan enemy air attack. A serious fire broke out necessitating the flooding ofmagazines. She is now resting on the bottom aft and the fire is out. casualties were 12 wounded, 3 seriously.In other attacks by enemy aircraft during the week H.M. Armed merchant cruiser Wolfe was hit by a bomb and sustained slight damage when about250 miles west of Donegal, and at Dover two of H.M. Trawlers were damaged and had combined casualties of 5 killed and 10 wounded.Some damage was caused in H.M. Dockyard, Chatham, during an air raidon the afternoon of the 13th.Dover was shelled on the 16th, but there were no naval casualties.On the 15th two of H.M. Trawlers in the Thames Estuary hit an enemy aircraft, probably a mine-layer, which exploded in mid-air, and on the same dayS.S. Port Auckland shot down an enemy bomber in Barking Reach. Later in theweek another enemy aircraft which was about to lay mines in the Thames Estuarywas hit and blown up by H.M. Minesweeper Golden Eagle.4. During the week a number of attacks on enemy shipping and bargesmoving along the coasts of Holland, Belgium and Northern France have beencarried out by aircraft, further details of which are included in the Air Sectionof this Summary. In the course of these attacks a number of merchant ships were sunk or damaged, an enemy destroyer was hit by torpedo-carrying aircraft during an attack on Cherbourg, and an enemy warship, possibly a cruiser, was successfully bombed off Ameland. Later in the week a further successful bombing attack was made on an enemy destroyer off Borkum, in which 1 direct hit wasmade and there were 2 very near misses. A successful attack was also carriedout by H.M. Submarine H. 49 on a large enemy convoy north of the Texel, twohits being made.Mediterranean.5. H.M. Submarine Parthian attacked a Zara-class cruiser (10,000 tonsmounting 6-inch guns) about 150 miles E.S.E. of Messina at 1430 on the31st August. Parthian first sighted destroyers followed by two Zara-classcruisers.   Passing through the destroyer screen Parthian fired 6 torpedoes at
i ftthe leading cruiser.    Two explosions were heard, and it is possible that thiscruiser was sunk.A convoy was escorted by H.M.S. Calcutta and two destroyers from alexandria to Piraeus. Cover was provided by the 3rd Cruiser Squadron and four destroyers. The convoy was unsuccessfully bombed several times when in the aegean.6. The Vice-Admiral, Light Forces, in H.M.S. Orion, with H.M.S.Illustrious and H.M.S. Valiant left Alexandria in the afternoon of the 15thto meet the 3rd cruiser squadron off Western Crete The force then proceeded tothe westward, and on the 16th aircraft from H.M.S. Illustrious carried out anattack on Benghazi during which one merchant vessel was set on fire, a destroyerwas probably sunk and several other ships damaged. An-enemy aircraft was alsoshot down. An air reconnaissance of Benghazi on the 19th showed 2 ships,probably tankers, on fire and 2 other large ships out of action. One cruiser,1 destroyer and 3 transports were seen entering harbour. During the night]7th/18th H.M.S. Kent, which had been ordered to bombard Bardia, was attacked by two torpedo aircraft in bright moonlight. She was hit by one torpedo, whichis believed to have been of the magnetic type. Subsequently, H.M. DestroyerNubian took her in tow and, under protection of H.M.S. Orion, she reachedAlexandria safely on the 19th. So far as is at present known, two officers,including the Commander, and thirty ratings were killed.During the night of the 17th/ 18th September H.M. Gunboat Dadybirdbombarded Escarpment Road, Sollum, at close range while H.M. Detroyers Junoand Janus attacked enemy concentrations at Sidi Barrani. Both these bombard-ments are believed to have had considerable success.Malta was raided by aircraft on the 15th and 17th, but no damage was done to naval ships or establishments.Other Foreign Stations.West Africa.7. Early on the 12th H.M. Destroyer Vidette, while on patrol offCasablanca, opened fire on a French four-funnelled destroyer steering N.W. at25 knots, which appeared to be acting in a hostile manner. No hits were made and Vidette ceased fire when the French destroyer signalled her name.The French cruiser force mentioned in last week&apos;s resume as having leftToulon for Casablanca was located at Dakar by air reconnaissance from.M.S. Ark Royal on the 15th September, and has been identified as consistingof the 6-inch cruisers Georges Leygues, Mont calm and Gloire and 3 destroyersof the Terrible class. British naval forces were disposed to watch their move-ments, and at 1000 on the 19th the 3 cruisers were sighted by H.M.A.S. australia to the north-westward of Freetown steering E.S.E. At 1840 they turned backto the north-westward at high speed. The Gloire broke down at 2100 and wishedto proceed to Konakri, but eventually agreed to return to Casablanca escorted by H.M.A.S. Australia. The remaining two cruisers proceeded to the north-westward shadowed by Cumberland and a Walrus aircraft from Bathurst. At0630 on the 20th the estimated position of these two cruisers was 40 miles Southof Dakar. A battle cruiser and 6 destroyers are now on patrol to prevent furtherFrench forces from the Mediterranean from reaching Dakar.8. Early on the 16th a report was received from two British merchant -vessels that a French cruiser of the Primauguet class and an oiler were 120 miles west of Freetown steering S.E; A cruiser force was disposed in the Gulf ofGuinea to intercept them and in the morning of the 18th they were sighted by aircraft from H.M.S. Cornwall. At 1630 on the 19th the Primauguet, with herattendant oiler, was to the south-westward of Takoradi steering to the westwardand being shadowed by H.M. Ships Cornwall and Delhi.9. The French S.S. Poitiers (4,185 tons) was abandoned by her crew, aftersetting the ship on fire and attempting to scuttle her, when sighted byH.M.S. Cumberland in the vicinity of Dakar on the 16th. Cumberland sank thePoitiers by gunfire and picked up all her crew. She was southward bound fromDakar to Tabu (Ivory Coast) and the Captain stated her cargo containedammunition, and that he and the crew were pro-Vichy and had orders to scuttle[21756]&apos; &apos; b
the ship.   Cumberland also intercepted the Spanish S.S. Domine (6,914 tons)S.W. of Dakar and placed an armed guard on board to take her to Freetown.A convoy with troops for Freetown has arrived there from United Kingdom.East Indies.10. On the 13th September H.M.S. Ceres was unsuccessfully attacked by enemy aircraft to the north-eastward of Mombasa, and on the 15th HM.S.Indus was unsuccessfully bombed in the southern Red Sea. During the weektroop convoys arrived at Mombasa from Aden, at Bombay from United Kingdomand at Suez from Bombay,Enemy Raiders.11. The W/T station at St. Helena reported having received a signal fromS.S. Thalia (8,329 tons) that she had heard gunfire when approximately 280 miles.W. of St. Helena. H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Carnarvon Castle has been ordered to patrol between positions S.W. of Dakar and S.E. of Ascension island to give cover to shipping on the Cape-Sierra Leone trade route. W/T transmissionfrom a German naval unit was heard W.N.W. from Simonstown on the 17th. whichcorresponds with the position already indicated.The&quot; Master of S.S. British Dominion reports having sighted a strangeGerman ship of the Trautenfels class on the 5th September 150 miles south ofMadagascar. The British Dominion was shelled by a German raider when 90miles south of this position on the 27th August.H.M.S. Dauntless has been on patrol in the Indian Ocean westward ofSumatra to intercept an enemy raider reported on the 10th September east ofMauritius.Anti-Submarine Operations.12. On the 10th September H.M. Submarine Sturgeon attacked and claimed to have hit a large U-Boat outward bound off the Jutland Bank. On the 12thH.M. Trawlers Cape Warwick and Cape Portland obtained a good contact 9 miles north-East of the Butt of Lewis and sighted a periscope after the first attack.On the 14th an aircraft from the Fleet Air Arm made a promising attack 20 miles north of Cape Wrath.During the night 18th/19th HAL Submarine Porpoise made an unsuccessfulattack on a U-Boat off Lorient.In the Mediterranean on the 14th H.M. Trawler Jade claimed to have madea successful attack on an Italian U-Boat off Malta.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.During the period 51,000 tons of shipping have been sunk by enemy action;of this total 9 ships (34,084 tons) were sunk by U-Boats in the Western and North-Western Approaches, 2 French ships were mined off the coast of Sardinia and3 British ships and 1 steam trawler (13,635 tons) sunk by air attack. total british tonnage lost amounted to 31,175. In addition to the above losses 1 greek and 7 British ships have been damaged by aircraft, and 4 British ships bytorpedoes from U-Boats. The British ships City of Benares and Marina were torpedoed far out in the North-Western Approaches on the 17th September andafter their outbound convoy had dispersed; the former ship was carrying 100children for Montreal, of which only 15 have so far been accounted for.&apos; Protection of Seaborne Trade.13. 1,003 ships, including 155 Allied and 45 neutral, were convoyed duringthe week ending noon, the 18th September, of which 3 were sunk by UBoats and2 by aircraft. One cruiser, 11 armed merchant cruisers, 28 destroyers, 14 sloopsand 23 corvettes were employed on escort duties. The total gross tonnage of shipsconvoyed to date is 127 million tons, of which 521,500 tons has been lost.14. Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the 14th September totalled 921,739 tons compared with 658,902 tons for the weekending the 7th September, and with 920,210 tons, the average for the previousten weeks. Seventeen tankers brought 175,803 tons of oil of various gradescompared with 71,023 tons of the previous week. Mineral imports were 302,860tons, of which 199,520 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore. Timberand wood pulp cargoes totalled 76,651 tons and cereals 194,371 tons, fourteenships being fully laden with grain.
Enemy Intelligence.German.15. There is no change in the situation of the German Main Units since last&apos;week. Results of photographic reconnaissance showed the following at Cherbourgon the 15th : 15 merchant vessels, 5 destroyers, 6 torpedo boats, 9 mine-sweepersand 4 E-Boats. Movements of shipping and barges, chiefly in a Westerlydirection, have continued and on the 16th reconnaissance showed activity atYmuiden, The Scheldt, Zeebrugge, Dunkirk and Calais. There is as yet no sign ofloading or unloading activity on the part of the numerous barges which are stillkept moored in large groups in various harbours. Air reconnaissance on the18th showed a reduction in the number of barges at Flushing, Ostend and Dunkirk,while at Boulogne there was an increase of 80 barges.German U-Boats have been less active in the period under review. Two orthree have been operating in the N.W. Approaches and one has been working in the Atlantic as far as 22&quot; W.Italian.16. There is little news of the main Italian Units except that on the13th September there were one cruiser and tihree destroyers at Tripoli and onthe 16th September one destroyer and 8 merchant ships at Benghazi.There have been two Italian submarines at work between the Azores andthe Coast of Portugal, but there is no recent news of them. They have appearedas far North as Cape Finisterre and as far South as Cape St. Vincent. It ispossible that the submarine reported off the latter point may have been additional to the two mentioned above.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German: ::      -17. The Salzburg, 1,765 tons, and the Larissa, 1,919 tons, arrived at Gelatzon the 11th and the 13th September respectively. Both had come from Poti withmanganese ore for Germany.The Weser, 9,179 tons, is reported to be going to sail from Manzanillo assoon as she has received 600 drums of lubricating oil which are said to be en routeover land. She has already received 19,000 barrels of diesel oil fuel and provisions.Italian.18. The tanker Torcello, 3,336 tons, arrived at Varna on the 15th Septemberfrom Batum with 5,000 tons of petroleum.The tanker Dentiee, 5,281 tons, which had scuttled herself of Maracaiboon the 10th June, was refloated on the 3rd September. She left on the13th September in tow of a Venezuelan Government tug for Puerto Cabello, where she will be interned.British Minelaying.19. In the period under review H.M.S. Porpoise has laid 50 mines in the bay of Biscay area and on the 14th September H.M.S. Teviot Bank 270 off the faroes. Aircraft minelaying has been continued by both Bomber and CoastalCommands in the Elbe, off the Flemish and Dutch Coasts, off the French channel ports and in the Bay of Biscay.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.Home Waters.20. During the week llth-18th September reports of suspected mine-laying by enemy aircraft off the East and South Coasts have been receivedevery night. These reports have covered the coast-line from the Orkneysto Portsmouth. In spite of these reports,, only one casualty has occurred and only tWo magnetic mines have been swept during the week; two of these mines were in the Humber, the other in the Tyne.   No.moored mines have been swept.Liverpool was closed owing to suspected minelaving by enemy aircraft onthe night of the 15th/16th September, but was re-opened at 1100/16.
During the last few days an increasing number of magnetic mines have been,dropped on shore.Three explosions which have recently occurred close to ships seem to indicatethat the enemy is using a new type of mine. Two of these explosions were iuthe Firth of Forth, the first six yards astern of a wooden motor fishing boat, andthe second rather less than seventy yards astern of a 5,000-ton merchant ship.Neither ship was damaged. The third explosion, which occurred ten yards from.M.S. Holderness in &quot;the Oaze Deep, only caused minor damage.The only remaining dangerous area in the Would has been searched withnegative result and cancelled.MILITARY SITUATION.Italy and Italian Possessions.21. This week has seen the beginning of the Italian offensive against Egypt.The advance has proceeded slowly but methodically, and at the present timeItalian forces have occupied Sidi Barrani, where they appear to be consolidating.The Italian main body consists of two motorised Italian divisions, supported bycorps troops, which are strong in artillery and M.T. The right flank is protected by strong A.F.V. units. In rear the 2nd Libyan Division and another division,thought to consist of black shirt Militia, have advanced into the Sollum area.Supplies for the main body are being transported by air. It is evident that theItalian advance will not be allowed to over-reach the lines of communication and is being conducted with considerable caution^ Although there is, as yet, no evidence of an advance further south from Giarabub or Oweinat, the garrison ofKassala on Sudan-Abyssinia border is now showing suspicious activity.Considerable numbers of troops, heavy M.T. and tanks have crossed the RiverGash, and it is thought that an early move is indicated. The strength of theItalian forces in Libya is estimated at 250,000 white troops and 25,000-30,000natives, and of those in Italian East Africa of 111,000 white troops (including allpotential reserves) and 195,600 native troops (including 44,000 irregulars).A detailed account of the operations on the Egypt-Libyan frontier is givenin paragraph 24 below.Yugoslavia.22. It is now confirmed that the army is at full war strength withapproximately 1.700,000 men under arms.Faroes.23.   The two 5-5 Coast Defence guns at Torshavn are now in position.The Middle East.Egypt.24. On the night 12th/13th September the enemy occupied Musaid and onthe morning of the 13th September were ranged along the line Wadi Nazrani-Capuzzo-Bir Band-Sidi Omar and were being harassed by the 4th Royal BorseArtillery followed by offensive patrols of the 3rd Coldstream Guards and 2nd RifleBrigade. The enemy column at Scheferzen had apparently joined that at SidiOmar and air reports indicated little depth to the advance.Later in the day an attack developed on Balfaya from the N.W. withinfantry trying to find a way down the escarpment. The most forward post ofColdstream Guards was withdrawn and 1st Royal Tank Regiment was engagedat midday. At the same time enemy infantry and M.T. in the vicinity of SidiOmar started to move N.E., the enemy&apos;s intention appearing to be to pinch outSollum.Early on the 14th September Sollum Barracks (about a mile along the roadtowards Musaid) were in the hands of the enemy and he was infiltrating down the escarpment.The enemy were advancing in three columns, the first with its head west of Balfaya (p\ miles south of Sollum) equipped with medium tanks and guns,
the second having its head at Bir Semin (7 miles due South of Sollum) and the third with its head about 3 miles West of the latter place and advancing N.E. Two squadrons of the Royal Tank Corps were engaging the enemy columns.

Enemy casualties during these three days were heavy and our own believed to be very small.

By 2000 hours the 15th September two enemy columns had reached a point about five miles West of Buq Buq. Our rearguard was based on Buq Buq and the withdrawal to Sidi Barrani proceeded according to plan. Enemy M.T. columns previously seen crossing the frontier were later seen approaching the Halfaya Pass, but there was no report of further formations behind them. The two enemy columns occupied Sidi Barrani by dusk the 16th September and are reported to be covered by A.F.Vs. South and East of the village. The enemy sustained heavy casualties during the day from harassing action by our tanks and artillery fire.

It now appeared probable that three enemy divisions were conducting the advance, 62nd and 63rd Divisions were deployed from Sidi Barrani to Sollum and the 2nd Libyan Division disposed between Sidi Omar and Halfaya continued to work on defended localities.

No important movement towards Bardia from the West was disclosed by air reconnaissance.

On the 17th September the two enemy columns at Sidi Barrani halted. Enemy tanks (believed medium) advanced about fourteen miles S.E. of Sidi Barrani and then turned Westwards and fifty enemy tanks were reported twenty miles S.W. of Sidi Barrani. These two groups were apparently an advance guard and flank guard respectively to the main columns.

On the 18th September the Italians appeared to be establishing their position at Sidi Barrani, and no enemy were reported beyond a line ten miles East of the village. The M.T. previously reported in the Halfaya area were still stationary.

Our mobile troops were on the line stretching S.W. from a point near the Coast, some 25 miles East of Sidi Barrani.

AIR SITUATION.

General Review.

27. Bombing operations have been concentrated on anti-invasion targets in the ports of North-West Germany, Holland, Belgium and Northern France and to a lesser degree on marshalling yards. Berlin was attacked on one night only. The enemy continued to direct his main attack on London, and latterly his bombing, especially at night, appears to have been entirely indiscriminate and he has achieved no very important results. Our fighters have successfully broken up large enemy formations attacking by day.

[21756] C
28. In the Middle East our bombers have made a successful attack on the dodecanese Islands and have considerably harassed the advance of the Italiansinto Egypt. Several successful attacks have been carried out by our Air Forcesin East Africa. The enemy has renewed his attacks on Malta. French aircraftcontinue to provide valuable reconnaissances in the Middle East.Great Britain.29. Enemy operations were chiefly confined to London and South-east england, although single attacks were reported in other districts and largerformations bombed Portland and Southampton on the 15th September. Severalaerodromes were attacked, but none suffered damage of any importance. Themain objectives appear to have been railways, public services and industrial targets : details of damage are set out in the Home Security Section. attacks were, however, largely indiscriminate, particularly at night. Reports have beenreceived of the occasional use by the enemy of single British aircraft with Britishmarkings, and an aircraft that attacked Dover on the 13th September wasidentified as a Blenheim. A number of parachute mines were dropped in theLondon area.30. During the period the enemy varied his daylight tactics according tothe weather. On days when thick cloud conditions prevailed, notably on the12th and 13th and the afternoon of the 18th September, single aircraft or forma-tions of only two or three used the cover provided to evade our fighters and makesurprise attacks, while on clays when the sky was clearer large formations,containing a preponderance of fighters, were employed. Heavy daylight attacks on the London Area were in every case engaged by strong forces of our fighters and suffered heavy casualties, especially on the 15th September, when the fighters had one of their best days and destroyed over 180 enemy aircraft, more than two-thirds&apos; of which were bombers. On the morning of the 16th and on the17th and 18th September large formations again crossed the Coast, but appearedto turn back on sighting our fighters and few enemy aircraft reached central london. On the 17th 250 enemy fighters were employed, to only fifty bombers,and, on the 18th, one of the formations consisted entirely of fighters evidently&quot; trailing their coats &quot; in an attempt to tire the defenders and reduce their strength.31. By night a considerable scale of attack has been maintained except onthe 14th/15th September, when it was surprisingly light in spite of favourable weather conditions. Activity has continued from dusk to dawn, and Londonhas again been the main target, but relatively small-scale attacks have beenreported throughout the country. During the early part of the period the attacks on London have been carried out by aircraft operating singly and approachingfrom the South-east and the Thames Estuary. On the night of the18tih/19th September, however, larger formations were plotted and attacks weredelivered from many directions. The anti-aircraft barrage has claimed severalvictims. Balloons too have been responsible for destroying two enemy bombers,and fighters have, at night, accounted for a further three, two of which were shot down by Defiants.32. Fighter Command flew 1,114 patrols involving 4,462 sorties. Detailsof casualties are given in Appendix V.Enemy Territory in Europe.33. Bomber Command flew a total of 104 day and 827 night sorties duringthe week. Daylight operations were again much restricted by unsuitable weather conditions but, except on the 12th/13tih September when the programme wascurtailed and on the 16th/7th September when all operations were cancelled,the weather was reasonably favourable at night and advantage was taken of thefull moon to increase the weight of attack. Daylight attacks, when possible, weremade on aerodromes and on the enemy&apos;s Channel ports but in most cases results were not observed, except at Zeebrugge where a tanker received a direct hit andthe Mole was straddled.34. The largest weight of attack by night was directed against shipping,barges and docks in the principal ports along the coasts of Germany and occupied territory  from  Wilhelmshaven  to  Cherbourg.    Coastal   Command  aircraft
collaborated in these operations.   Bad visibility made difficult the location ,ofthe ports in Germany and only light attacks were delivered, in most cases with no visible result, but Antwerp and the ports in Belgium and Northern france were all heavily bombed and reports indicate that extensive damage must have&apos;been done to docks, barges and shipping.35. A marshalling yard near Brussels and those in the Ruhr and western germany were also important objectives and many of these attacks seem to havebeen successful. The gun emplacements at Cap Gris Nez were bombed withapparent success on four separate occasions, and on the night of the14th/ 15th September a direct hit was obtained on the Chateau d&apos;Argenteuil,North-West of Paris, which is alleged to be Goring&apos;s headquarters, ancl several other bombs fell close to the target. Berlin was visited on only one occasion,two aircraft attacking the West Power Station on the night of the 15th/16thwithout observing results. Secondary targets attacked were mainly aerodromes and seaplane bases. Several encounters with enemy aircraft were reported andon one occasion a Wellington was unsuccessfully attacked on its return by aMe. 110 lying in wait above the aerodrome.North Sea and Coastal.36. During the week 290 patrols, involving 475 sorties and 139 convoy escorts, were flown by Coastal Command, ancl Bomber Command aircraft flew a daily North Sea sweep. The usual reconnaissance flights were carried out.Minelaying was continued on most nights by aircraft from both Bomber and coastal Commands in the Lorient, Havre, Schelde, Schouwen Islands and Elbeareas. On the 14th September two Sunderlands successfully escorted nine Battlesto Iceland, and escorts were also provided for Empire flying boats. In additionto the attacks on ports already described, numerous attacks were made on shipping off the enemy&apos;s coasts during the week.37. On the 12th September a Pludson attacked twenty Danish fishing boats off Horns Reefs without known result, and three Blenheims, escorted by fighters,attacked fifteen vessels off Havre and hit a merchant ship and a tanker. Thefollowing day nine Skuas of the Fleet Air Arm attacked oil cisterns at Bergenwithout known result, but a merchant ship was hit and set on fire. Two of our aircraft failed to return. On the 15th September bursts were seen amonga group of barges being towed by merchant ships off Boulogne, and later twobarges were hit near the same position. The same day ten merchant ships and forty barges, accompanied by E-Boats and two destroyers, were sighted offAmeland and a merchant ship was hit, while a Beaufort successfully torpedoedanother near Ymuiden. On the night of the 15th/T6th a Whitley reported adirect hit on a cruiser off Terschelling. On the following clay a merchant ship in convoy was sunk off Ameland and considerable damage was done to ten small ships off Borkum. There were several encounters with enemy aircraft, and onthe 13th a Hudson attacked two seaplanes off Terschelling and damagedthem both.38. The enemy flew regular weather reconnaissances covering most of theNorth Sea to the Shetlands and sometimes as far as the Faroes. Some attacks were made on our shipping in the North-Western Approaches, and a dailyoffensive reconnaissance was flown off the West Coast of Ireland. Enemy mine-laying aircraft were active on most nights and these usually operated up theEast Coast from the Thames Estuary as far as Aberdeen, along the South Coastwestwards from Dungeness or in the Bristol Channel.Middle Bast and Mediterranean.Gibraltar39. On the 15th September a London flying boat was destroyed by a Frenchfighter near Casablanca. Both pilots were killed, but the crew were rescued. TheFrench authorities claim that the aircraft was in a prohibited area and hadopened fire first.
Malta.40. After a period of inactivity the Italians attacked the Island on the night of the 14th/15th September., but without effect, as most of the bombs fell in thesea. On the 15th and 17th September, however, mixed formations of Ju. 87&apos;s and fighters, including some Me. 109&apos;s, attacked the aerodromes at Halfar and Luqa.A Hurricane in a hangar and a Wellington on the aerodrome were destroyed and several delay action bombs were dropped on the landing ground. Two Ju. 87&apos;s,a C.R. 42 and probably one further enemy aircraft were shot down by our fighters.Dodecanese.41. On the 19th September a successful attack was made by five Wellingtonson the Islands. Fires were started at Maritza in Rhodes, and several explosionswere followed by fires at Calato. Hangars, barracks and the harbour jetty were hit at Leros and the fire from a fuel store spread along the coast. All our aircraft returned safely.Egypt and Libya.42. Daily reconnaissance flights were carried out over enemy aerodromes and seaplane bases in Libya and to report the movements of the Italian forcesmoving towards Sidi Barrani and Buq Buq from Sollum. Elements of this force,especially the M.T. columns, were continually harassed and many direct hits were observed. A.A. fire was encountered and one column was equipped with, guns of at least 3-inch calibre. Day and night attacks were also made on aerodromes and seaplane bases in Libya, including Benina near Benghazi, and severalenemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground and buildings damaged, while apetrol dump was firecl at Benina. Two of our aircraft were lost during these operations. As described in the Naval Section, aircraft from H.M.S. Illustrioussuccessfully attacked Benghazi on the 16th September.43. C.R. 42 and other fighters in formations, amounting to about 100aircraft in all, were apparently used to protect the columns advancing on Sollum,and to attack British concentrations of mechanised vehicles with anti-personnelbombs and machine-gun fire. Enemy bombers attacked the aerodrome at MaatenBagush on the night of the 14th/ 15th and rendered it temporarily unserviceable,and several attacks were also made on Sidi Barrani and Mersa Matruh, but little damage was caused. On the 15th September ten S. 79&apos;s were intercepted by a mixed force of Hurricanes, Blenheims and Gladiators over Sidi Barrani and six were definitely destroyed and probably a further two; one Gladiator was lost. One S. 79 was shot down by a fighter near Alexandria and a seaplane was destroyed by two Sunderlands on coastal patrol. During the night 17th/18thH.M.S. Kent was torpedoed by enemy aircraft as already described.Sudan, Aden and East Africa.44. Our bombers stationed in the Sudan made two attacks on Kassala, wherebombs were seen to fall near the station and military huts, and on several targets in Eritrea. At Gura, on which numerous attacks were made, workshops and hangars were hit and successful attacks were carried out on the barracks atMassawa, the aerodrome at Asmara and the Caproni workshops south of Asmara.Warehouses and jetties at Assab were bombed on several occasions by aircraft from Aden, which also attacked targets at Diredawa and Zeilah.45. Aircraft of the South African Air Force attacked aerodromes atSciasciamane and Jimma, both south of Addis Ababa, and direct hits were obtained on hangars and buildings and at least two Caproni bombers were destroyed on the ground. The aerodromes at Mogadiscio, in Italian Somaliland,and Javello, in Southern Abyssinia, were also attacked and many buildingsdamaged and fires started, while one enemy aircraft was destroyed on the ground.In these operations we lost three aircraft. After particularly determined attacks on Sciasciamane and Jimma it was noticed that a chain of warning beacons hadbeen lit directly our aircraft entered Italian Territory.46. On, the 10th September enemy aircraft attacked the aerodrome atKhartoum, the^ town of Atbara and the railway station at Shediyeb, between
Atbara and Port Sudan, and bombs wei&quot;e dropped on Aden on the 17th and the19tlh September, but in no case has any serious damage been reported.Air Intelligence.Italy.47. A reliable source states that two squadrons from Rome, together withother units from the Turin area, are leaving for the North of France on the18th September. Italy could probably spare six fighter squadrons from these districts, and, in order to make the best impression on the Germans, these units will probably be equipped with the Macchi 200, the latest Italian fighter,of which a further 50 have recently been delivered to the Air Force. This aircraftcompares unfavourably with British and German types.48. It is now reported that a fresh group of 200 officers and N.C.O.&apos;s havearrived at Graz for dive-bomber training. The previous group to attend thiscourse was sent back to Italy as the personnel were unable to stand up to the strain.Spain.49. A slight increase in the strength of the Spanish Air Force in spanish morocco is reported, six Me. 109 fighters and four C.R. 32 fighters having arrived in Tetuan from Spain on the 2nd September. These are the first air reinforce-ments sent to Spanish Morocco since the concentration of the Spanish Air Force in southern Spain.Roumania.50. It is reliably reported that German anti-aircraft guns, with Germancrews, will shortly be installed around Ploesti.Turkey.51. Work on the all-weather runways at Ankara, Corlu, Kutahya, Yesilkoyand Izmir is progressing and is expected to be completed by the end of October.Japan.52. It appears probable that the Japanese reinforcement of South Chinawith both military and air forces has already begun.HOME SECURITY.General.53. The enemy&apos;s main attack is still centred on London. The main objectives would appear to have been : 1.   Communications, particularly railways.2.   Electrical undertakings.Another important objective would appear to be the weakening of public morale.54. The hits on railways in the London Area have not been followed upby attacks on the resulting congestions of traffic in the marshalling yards.55. The moral effect of the intensification of the A.A. barrage on the publichas been very striking.Damage.Docks.56. The Thames Estuary area has again been subjected to attacks, but these have been much less effective than last week, though a serious fire at the thames Haven Oil storage tanks was caused on the night of 16th/17th.Several attacks on Liverpool seem to have been aimed at the docks, but theonly noteworthy damage done was to the West Alexandra Dock at Bootle.[21756] d
Railways.57. Apart from isolated instances, damage to railways has been confined tothe London Area where the damage has been serious and considerable dislocationhas resulted. Connections between Clapham Junction, Victoria and &quot;Waterloohave been attacked on five separate occasions, on one of which ClaphamJunction Station itself was hit. Other places where railway damage was done areWest Brompton, Marylebone, St. Pancras, Wandsworth, Paddington andFenchurch Street.Industry.5S. Several important industrial premises in the London Area have suffered damage but in the majority of cases production has not been seriouslyinterrupted. In the rest of the country, Cardiff is the only place where majordamage to industry has occurred.Gas, Electricity and Power.59. The supply of gas and electricity has been interrupted in severalLondon districts and various telephone exchanges temporarily put out of action.The Power Stations at Battersea and Finsbury were damaged.Public Buildings and Private Property.60. In the London Area damage to civilian property has been widespread,and in the aggregate considerable. In the West End considerable damage was done on the nights of the 16th/17th and 17th/18th. Outside London seriouscivilian damage has been done at Liverpool (which was attacked three times),Warrington, Brighton, Leicester, Birmingham, Coventry, Portland, Eastbourneand Exeter.Civilian Casualties.61.   Killed, 988; injured 4,051 (including slight casualties).The figures for London during the period are: killed, 711; injured 1,042.These must be regarded as approximate.Unexploded Bombs.62. This problem remains acute and much of the dislocation of com-munications is due to unexploded or delayed action bombs. They have alsonecessitated the tempoi&apos;ary evacuation of considerable numbers of people.Every effort is being made to strengthen the bomb disposal parties to deal withthe various aspects of the situation.Parachute Mines.63. A formidable parachute mine made its first appearance among theenemy&apos;s weapons on the 17th and was again used on the nights of the 17th/18thand the 18th/19th. The mine is in the form of a cylinder about 8 ft. in lengthby 2 ft. diameter, and its blast force is very extensive. Preliminary inspectionsupports the view that the mines are the ordinary magnetic ones and already anumber have been rendered harmless by Naval personnel.

APPENDIX YI.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports on damage have been received during the past week from air reconnaissance and Intelligence sources : Germany.Mannheim. The production at Brown Boveri, well-known electricalengineers, has ceased for the time being owing to severe damage.Berlin. The Henschel Schonefeld Works, the Carlsruhe Works (manufac-turing pistols and other war material) and the Argus Works (said to bemanufacturing B.M.W. Hornets) have all received direct hits.Regensburg.- Following the bombardment of Regensburg petroleum barges,loaded at Orsova for Regensburg, were ordered to discharge at Vienna orBratislava.Kiel and Hamburg. Particularly severe damage was caused at Kiel and atthe port and surroundings of Hamburg on the lOth/llth September.Jena. Very serious damage has been caused in the raid on Jena.Hamburg. The Bismarck was seriously damaged during an R.A.F. raid overthe Elbe, probably the 8th or the 9th September.It is reported that the Brazilian Consul-General at Hamburg phoned hiscolleague at Geneva saying he was preparing to leave as the bombardment wasunbearable.Leipzig. It is stated that people are subject to fines if they do not takeshelter, foreigners being compelled to go first. The raids were never expected and adequate shelters were not available.The Erla Maschinenwerke G.m.b.H. has been seriously damaged butproduction still continues.Vienna. The order issued to German Air Raid Wardens to shoot into houseswhere lights were showing during the black-out has now been extended to Vienna.Denmark.Noticeable shortage of coal is reported. This is said to be due to breakdown of railway transport in North Germany as a result of raids.Italy.The Roumanian Minister in Lisbon, who has just arrived at Bucharest,reports that the Marelli works at Milan are almost completely destroyed, andthere is a good deal of damage on the outskirts of the town.From a censorship source it is learnt that both telephone and telegraphcommunications in Milan were interrupted between the 22nd and the 25th August.The same source also reports that the firm of Fiat are &apos;&apos; unable to assume anyfurther undertakings or forecast prices.&quot; This indicates disorganisation, if notmaterial damage.
