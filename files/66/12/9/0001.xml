They agreed to take 1,000 Germaninternees and work was begun on the construction of a campat a cost provisionally estimated at $150,000.     The orders were given by the Dominions Office,,     Owing to the sinking of the Arandora Star the internees (who would have been temporarily accommodated in tents) never reachedNewfoundland, and on the 3rd August the new found land government were told that it was not desired that any further expenditure should be incurred in connection with the camp8On the 6th the Government wired that all work on the camphad been stopped,,      20,000 has been paid to the new found land government as an advance on account of expenditure on thec amp oOwing to accommodation difficulties in thiscountry, it Is now desired to send abroad prisoners of war,and in particular it is desired that this camp in newfoundland should be completed if possible.The Newfoundland Government agreed to acceptinternees, but it is understood from the Dominions office that they will probably see more difficulty in acceptingprisoners of war owing to the sparse population of thecountryP and, in any case, if prisoners of war are sentthey would no doubt require military guards from thiscountry, at any rate for some time.Although in June last the Cabinet were aware thatat that time Departments were proposing to transfer abroadboth prisoners of war and internees I cannot find that therehas been any formal approval of the policy in regard to prisoners of war.      I therefore ask the War Cabinet todecide as a matter of policy whether prisoners of war should be sent abroad, and, if so, whether the new found land government should be pressed to accept up to 1,000 if the camp in question can be completed before winter sets in.A.E.The War Office,20th September, 1940c
