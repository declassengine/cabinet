All available supplies and material, all resources of every sort, including man-power, shouldbe retained here.2. If the Germans fail to attack Great Britain, that is a victory. If theGermans attack and are burled back, that is a decisive victory. If we canprevail until the winter months, the Americans will come into the war and theissue will be settled in our favour.3. For these reasons, I oppose any diversion of any resources whatsoeverfor any purpose other than the defence of Britain.4. And I hold that all our resources should be used forthwith, even at theexpense of our programme in the future.Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production.B.Ministry of A aircraft Production, S.
