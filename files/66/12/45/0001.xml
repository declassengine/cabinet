My proposals were not approved,but at the Cabinet discussion I undertook to work out iiiconsultation with the Minister without Portfolio theactual priority to be accorded, which I understood wasto be substantialo     Indeed the Prime Minister suggestedthat something like 60 j of the total available suppliesof come:.,.t might be needed for the Air Ministry programme.30 I therefore supplied the Minister&apos; without Portfoliowith a statement of the Air Ministry requirements hut I now learn that as a result of decisions by the variousPriority Committees the Air Ministry allocations fall veryshout- of needs.      Unless our requirements are met in fts&amp;3U itwill not bo possible for me to complete in. time the aerodromeconstruction, programme laid &quot;down, by the War Cabinet,4, In Appendix A to this paper I have compared AirMinistry requirements in cement, steely timber and bricks withthe proposed allocationso5, At the suggestion of the Minister without. Portfolio,I have carefully considered the possibili-ties of usingsubstitutes for cement and of effecting eVconomies in its u e.6S I have considered whether tarmac   can be adopted to a greater degree in the i3ace of cement.- -  Tarnlac. aaficoncrete - are already used by the Air Ministry inapproximately equal quantities for construction of runways

and. perimeter tracks;    and having regard to (i) the short supply of hardcore or pitching which is required for thebottoming and (ii) the fact that tarmac runways haveinadequate bearing value for heavy aircraft, I am afraid that no material increase in the use of tarmac as a substitute for cement can be expected.7. Furthermore other substitutes for cement are being used to the maximum possible extent and the use of this material is also being restricted by reducing the thicknessof runways to the minimum consistent with safety and byother means.     Had these various measures not been takenour requirement would, of course, have been much greaterbut no further economies which would have an appreciableeffect are possible.8. I ask the War Cabinet to decide whether the AirMinistry is to be allocated the quantities of material required for the completion of the authorised programme ofaerodrome construction.     I am informed that if thematerial is made available supply of adequate labour will follow.(Intld)    A.H.M.S.Air Ministry, S.W.I.,12TH OCTOBER,   1940.
