DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .S E C R E T.\i.T?.(UO)  UOO, COPY NO.   2 12ND OCTOBER.  19^0.AR CABINET.T!i.&apos;J BURMA ROAD AGREEMENT.Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.My colleagues will be aware that during the early-part of last month we were manoeuvring for position with the Japanese Government (by emphasising thetemporary nature of the Burma Road agreement and theJapanese obligations under it).    The object of this wasto gain for ourselves the maximum freedom on 17th-October,  the date of its normal expiration,  tp reopen the road if the general war situation permitted,2. Since then there have been two majordevelopments:(a) Indo-China;    and(b) the German-Italian-Japanese Paot.In face of these developments the renewal of theagreement would be difficult to justify to publicopinion in this country and would have a very damagingeffect in both China and the United States.      Thequestion in fact at the moment is perhaps not so muchwhether we should reopen the Burma road as when.3. There are three possible courses:(a) to say nothing and merely refuse to renew the agreement;(b) to announce now our intention not to renew;    and(c) to cancel the agreement forthwith,basing our action on the general groundthat it is evident that Japanese policyno longer permits the hope that theagreement will achieve the objects forwhich we concluded it,Aj.. Sir R. Craigie admits that course (c) would givethe Japanese an opportunity of accusing us of a breach of our obligations and might lead to some activereprisal such as the repudiation of the &quot;Asarna Maru&quot;agreement.    He does not, however,  consider that eventhe immediate reopening of the Burma road would inpresent circumstances lead to war.      Though prophecy is dangerous,&apos;I share this view.      If the Japanese decide to

challenge the British Empire to war,  it v/ill beon a wider calculation of the issues than this.Sir Robert Craigie is on the whole in favour ofcourse (c) on the ground that it is amply justified by Japanese action in Indo-China and the conclusionof the pact with the Axis, and because it is likelyto have the maximum effect on Japan and on the SovietGovernment.      But he emphasises &quot;the necessity ofmarching in step with the United States and his recommendation is in fact subject to the explicitapproval of that Government.5. Lord Lothian has made it clear that in his view the case for refusing to renew the Burma Roadagreement as seen from Washington is overwhelming,and he reported on 16th September that Mr. CordellHull &quot;greatly hoped that we would reopen the burma road&quot;,      Since then the United States have granted anew loan to China and have announced a ban on theexport to Japan of scrap metal to come into force,significantly enough,  on 16th October,  i.e.  the day before the expiration of the Burma Road agreement.Lord Lothian&apos;s conversations with the State Departmenthave dealt with non-renewal rather than repudiation,and the attitude of the United States Government is now made clear in his telegram No.  211+6 (annexed),namely(a) they hope that the road will not remainclosed after 17th October;(b) cancellation of the agreement before17th October would be needless provocation;and(c) in order to avoid a second crisis threeweeks hence the best course would be to notify the Japanese Government at once ofour intention not to renew the agreement.6. Mr. Hull&apos;s views as expressed to Lord Lothiancorrespond generally with my own.7. In the new situation it is more important than ever that the China war should be kept going, and the sooner we can announce our policy and fortify theChinese the better.      Sir R. Craigie thinks that theJapanese hope to secure German intervention inChungking, and it is significant that the ChineseGovernment have twice during the last week enquired asto our general attitude towards Japan.      Chiang Kai-shek has himself requested that the Burma agreement should not be renewed and has begged for a very earlyreply.8. If my colleagues agree that we should announceas soon as possible our decision not to renew theagreement, how is this to be done?     The agreementdoes not contain any provision for renewal and anotification to the Japanese Government as suggestedby Mr.  Cordell Hull is to that extent inappropriate.

It might only exacerbate the situation.      I suggest thatthe best and least provocative method would he a reply toa Parliamentary Question next Tuesday in the sense thatthe agreement was concluded for a definite period and contained no provision for renewal, and that in any casein view of recent developments H.M. Government would have felt unable to agree to renewal if this had been inquestion.      If this is approved I would propose to informChiang Kai-shek of our intention in strict confidencewithout delay, and to instruct Sir R. Craigie to informthe Japanese Government, on the day before the announcement,of the question which had been asked and the reply whichHvM. Government intend to give.9, H.M. Ambassador at Moscow has been asked to enquirethe views of the Soviet Government on the Par eastern situation generally and if M. Molotov raises the questionof the Burma Road to elicit,  if possibles his views onthe question of its reopening.      I see no reason to awaitthese views on the latter point, as Sir S. Cripps hasalready recommended a vigorously concerted Anglo-Americanpolicy in the Par East as a part of our answer to theJapanese-Axis pact.      The action now suggested is in line with that recommendation.     But it might assist him inhis further talks with the Soviet Government to authorise him to give them also short advance notice of our proposed action.(Intld. ) H.Foreign Off i ce , S.

ANNEXNo. 2146,MOST IMMEDIATE.Your telegrams No,  2383 and 2409.I had a discussion this morning with Secretary ofState as to American view of Berlin and Rome Tokyo pact.Mr. Hull said that he had long been convinced that therewas an underground agreement between the three aggressorPowers and that the signing of the pact therefore did notin his opinion change the fundamentals of the position,though it had come as a shock to American public opinion.It would certainly make ho difference to the policy ofthe Administration0    Policy of the Administration was togive all possible help to Britain which was the main theatre of the war between the three Axis Powers and the Democraciesand to maintain unchanged its policy of resistance in all practical ways short of war to Japanese aggression in the far East.As regards assistance to Great Britain the effect of the pact had been to drive the Administration to the conclusionthat the immediate necessity was to build up Americanproduction of armaments in all possible ways as Lord Beaver-broolc had done for air in England, so that supplies availablefor Great Britain should, if possible, be larger and availablsooner than had been expected.As regards the Par East, Mr. Hull said that the UnitedStates Government had already cut off scrap, and that machine tools would now be unavailable for Japan because of theimmensity of the demands for American defence and Hornbecktold aie that the oil question was dropping out of favourbecause of its effect on the Dutch and that the United StatesGovernment were working out all necessary details in caseUnited States Government decided to restrict the purchaseof silk from JapaneI then discussed with Mr. Hull the Burma Rpad question on the lines indicated in your telegram No. 2383.    Mr. Hull,while inflexible in his determination to resist japanese aggression, is anxious to avoid any crisis in the Par east which might have the effect of diminishing supplies toGreat Britain.     He clearly thought His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould not denounce the Burma Road Agreement before itsexpiry on 18th October as a needless provocation.   On theother hand, he said definitely that the United StatesGovernment hoped that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not agree to closing the road after that date if only becausethe United States Government were anxious that everything possible should be done to keep China in the firing line.If His Majesty&apos;s Government share this view, he thoughtit would be a good plan to notify Japanese Government atonce that we did not intend to renew agreement in orderto avoid a second crisis three weeks hence.    I asked him

whether he thought that refusal to renew the agreement would precipitate an armed attack tm us by Japan.    He said he did not think so unless Japan was already determined for other reasons to precipitate a conflict.      I- then asked him what support United States would be prepared tcgive us if Japan attacked because w e re-opened the Road.As usual Mr. Hull gave the answer which is inevitable for constitutional reasonsc    He could enter into no pledger*f any kind.    At the same time he reiterated the intentionof His Government to maintain opposition to japanese aggression especially by economic means, and at the endof the conversation he asked whether it w^uld not bepossible for the United States   Australia and Dutch and ourselves tc have private staff discussions immediately on technical problems which would be involved in common action for defence, though it must be perfectly clear thatthese conversati oizs were to be technical and not to concern themselves with political policy.See my immediately following telegram.
