(UP) 266th Conclusions, Min. 2)I am anxious to lay plans for future convoys to theMiddle East.      As I think you know, we had at one time contemplatedan interim convoy about the third week in October, and a big convoy,the slow portion of which would leave on 7th November and the faston 17th November.      This, however, means asking the Admiralty forthree escorts over a short period, and after full discussion here wewould suggest proceeding on the following basis:-(i)    Abandon idea of any interim convoy in October.(ii)    Advance date of slow convoy in November so that it mayleave on 1st November instead of the 7th.We would include in this 1st November convoy both the M.T. ships wehad contemplated using in the third week in October and thosedetailed for the 7th November.      This would give us a considerablecapacity which we y/ould suggest using to despatch the followingformations:-(a) Remainder of 2nd Armoured Division, i,et2 Cruiser Tank Regiments2 Light Tank RegimentsSupport GroupDivisional HeadquartersA total of 11,000 personnel(b) 1 Australian Brigade.We would propose that the fast convoy should still sail on17th November as previously arranged.      This would be composed ofliners and would include a number of personnel - Gunners, Field andA*A. Sappers, Signals, Artisan Workshops, etc.  - for which Wavellhas asked.      If the Admiralty were able to find escorts on this basis,Armoured Division should reach Suez on the lLj.th December, and liners -a few days later.We have now to weigh the balance of risk in sending theseArmoured Units.     We had on 29th September 179 Cruiser Tanks in thiscountrye      To send these units would leave us with 79 plus Octoberproduction.      We have at present here 318 Light Tanks;    thisarrangement would leave us with 198.     We have at present here 259&apos;l&apos; tanks, and this number is being added to at an average rate of12 to 15 a week.     Cruisers are coming out at the rate of about 9 aweek.      There is also the Support Group, for which work special training is required, and if the 2nd Armoured Division&apos;s group issent, only the re-formed &quot;Calais&quot; Rifle Battalions would remain.

There is this further difficulty, that if theremainder of the 2nd Armoured Division is to leave thiscountry in a month1s time, their vehicles will needthorough overhauling and preparation for the Desert&quot;before they go.     To enable this to he done they willhave, to &quot;begin to he withdrawn from their hat tie stationswith the next few days.We have given this subject the most careful thought here and on halance we &quot;believe that it is righithat the 2nd Armoured Division should &quot;be sent as hereproposed^     We should &quot;be compelled as a consequence,in the event of invasion, to rely to an increasing extent upon &quot;I&quot; tanks, though the small output of cruisers would gradually improve the situation in that respect also, &quot;but there is accumulating evidence ofGerman assistance to Italians in Libya, and should thiseventuate within the next two months, the presence ofthese additional armoured forces may just turn the scales      Egypt.I have spoken to Commander-ir-Chief on thissubject and, in the circumstances, he does not feelthat he can resist this decision.I have not dealt here with the possibility of passing any or all of these Armoured Units throughthe Mediterranean.     If this were possible, there wouldhe a saving in time of, I think, something &quot;between three and four weeks.War Office, S.W. 1.,5th October, 1940.
