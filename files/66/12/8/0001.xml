It is requested that special care may be taken toff.P.(40)378. . ...       &apos;20th September, l%We the secrec* of th,s d^ument.WAR   CABINET.THE ARMY PROGRAMME.Memorandum by the MinisterofLabour and national Service %1.     The number of men required to fulfil   the programme of Army expansion setout in the Secretary of State for War&apos;s memorandum (W.P. (40) 370) would represent a formidable draft on the nation&apos;s man-power.     The question ofman-power requirements is at present under examination by a Committee of theProduction Council under Sir William Beveridge,     I should like to defer moreconsidered observations on the man-power aspects of the Secretary of State&apos;proposal until that Committee1 s survey has been completed, when I hope it maybe possible to give the War.Cabinet a picture of the man power position as awhole.     The &quot;preliminary observations which I make below will show that, ifthe Army programme is accepted as it stands, problems will arise next summer,.,and will become increasingly difficult thereafter^&quot;&apos; regarding the &quot;sources ofsupply   of the necessary numbers of men.2.     The Army programme of intake is as follows:-(1) September, 1940 to March 1941 (inclusive) 300,000(seven months)(2) April to October, 1941 (inclusive) 700,000(seven months).(3) Thereafter monthly . 120,000 to 150,000falling, after about six months, to 100,000(Note.   In what follows allowance has been made so far as can be estimated for meeting the demands of the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force).3,     No difficulty is anticipated in regard, to the first of these periods -to march, 1941.     From the men already registered and for the most part medically examined, together with those who will become available from the two age groups already proclaimed but not yet registered, we can provide the 300,000referred to and still have a fairly substantial balance at the end of March 1941.4,  &apos; To meet the requirements of the second period, April to October, 1941, weshall have on the basis of existing legislation:-(a.) the balance referred to in the preceding paragraphCb) the men who will have reached age 20 in the meantime(c) ^nuths of 18 and 19 if it is decided to call these up(d) men in the upper age groups (36 to 40) covered by the National Service(Armed Forces) Act,5,     An exact estimate of the number of men who will be available from these various sources is hardly possible, but on the most favourable assumptions it is unlikely to be higher than 600,000 in total.     Thus from the sources available under existing legislation (assuming that it is decided to make use of allthe se sources) and vid.tb.out the release of further men from industry we shall probably find considerable difficulty in meeting the Army&apos;s demands fully inthe second period under review ending in October, 1941,
6.     Still less shall vre.be able, to meet the demands after that date which may amount to as many as 1,5 CO, COO men in the -first, twelve -months, with perhaps a somewhat lower number subsequently. -7.     The further sources of supply are -(a) youths achieving&quot; the lower&quot; age limit of liability: for military..... .. service. -. ,      These would only amount to 10,000 &quot;or &quot;12,000 a month.(b) extension of liability to military service of men of 41 and above.This by itself Would not produce men in the required numbers - it is-   unlikely that each age groups would produce as many as 30,000 men..(c-) Release, of men at present reserved to industry.   &apos;   &apos;&quot; &quot;&apos; - :v&quot;8.   -,. It is clear that men in anything like the numbers envisaged in the.Secretary of State&apos;s proposals- can only be obtained by withdrawing men at  &quot;present reserved to industry.     Examination of the Schedule of Reserved&quot;Occupations Is going, on all the time and classes of men are constantly being-released for service with the Armed Forces. .   It is&apos; not unlikely that this;continuing review of the Schedule&apos; together With certain additional steps - - ::-which I am taking .in -the same direction will, result in the release&apos;during- thenext twelve months of sufficient men to fill the gap between the Army -:programme and the foreseeable supply of men up.to October., -194-1.   - But the-release of men from industry at the rate of,. 1? to .lg million per year whichthe further programme would appear&apos; to- require&apos;-&apos;is a matter of an&quot;.entirely&apos;   &apos;different-order raising serious, problems; 6n which I feel that it would&apos;bebetter not to attempt- to form definite&apos; views pending the completion -of the survey of man-power requirements no?/, being undertaken.     At present I would only emphasise again that under modern, conditions large military forces requirlarge, well-equipped and efficient industry behind- them.      : -i        .      w9.   . I venture...to suggest that any decision on the Secretary of State&apos;s       .-paper as to the programme of intake into the Army after March, 1941, should for the &quot;moment he provisional and:that,-in-:the meantime we should not come to Ml. any .-.conclusion as to the sources from&apos;which additional supplies of men IBshould be&quot;obtained or the order in which those sources should be tappedv ^-rff20th September j 1940. .    -   . t;  -      r  *   *^H.Q. 597-50 I.J.
