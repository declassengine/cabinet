1 i 3fDraft Telegram to Madrid.October, 1940.Your telegram No. 252 Saving /of Sept.27th:    message from M. Baudouin^.You are authorised to give    the followingmessage to the French Ambassador.H.M.G. are and always have been prepared toenter into discussions with the French government at Viohy with a view to avoiding misunderstandingsand friction.     When M. Baudouin sent a messagethrough Mo La Baume suggesting a modus Vivendiregarding the French Colonial Empire, I repliedat once with a request to be told in greater detail what M. Baudouin had in mind.     No answer was received and since then the French forts andFrench ships at Dakar have fired on the british war vessels when invited to parley, and Frenchaircraft have bombed Gibraltar without warning.In spite of these hostile acts H.M.G. are stillready to enter into talks with the FrenchGovernment.      But two points must be made clear from the outset:-(a) Should French armed forces againattack British vessels or british territory, such as Gibraltar, H.M.G.will immediately retaliate with all their force against French Colonialports and territory.(b) Any discussions with the FrenchGovernment must be within the frame-work of the message you have receivedfrom the French Ambassador and notbe based on the previous messagereceived on September 26th by yourNaval Attache from his French colleague.(c) It must be understood that H.M.G.cannot withdraw their support ofGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s movement andmust give him such support as herequires to maintain his authority inthose French Colonies which haxerallied/to&quot;his cause.2.

(b) If the French Government can furnishadequate assurances on the above point,His Majesty&apos;s Government would beprepared to receive any proposalswhich the French Government may wishto make regarding the possibilityof some trade exchanges betweenFrench Colonies and unoccupied france,,3, It should be made clear that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment attach the utmost importance to theirblockade weapon which they must continue to employ tothe full against the enemy.   They could only contemplate any relaxation, if aboslutely satisfied that the FrenchGovernment are able and willing as regards their overseas territories to act independently of german or Italian dictation and are moreover ready to abandon the attitude of hostility which they Imre hitherto shownin their dealings with His Majesty&apos;s Government04, Meanwhile, for your own^information you should know that His Majesty&apos;s ships have orders to interferewith all French ships, both warships and merchantmen,who attempt to proceed to French occupied ports, u 4gSiili&apos;;:this His Majesty1 s Ships for the present are acquiescing in the passage of French merchant vessels from Africanports to French Mediterranean ports when under navalconvoy.r
