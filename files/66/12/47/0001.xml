The Committee&apos;s main proposals ore;-(i)     That the issue and cancellation of air raid warnings * which are at present issuedand cancelled from Headquarters fighter command, should in respect of the districts concerned be decentralised toNos. 9 and 10 Group Headcuarters asan experiment.(ii)     That &quot;alarms within the alert&quot; should beissued from Observer Group Centres to central points and thence distributed to factories or, where local circumstances&apos;Jus^fyr^HTs^7t0 the public .3- We recommend that these proposals should be adopted and that effect should be given without delay to therecommendations of the Committee -4. It must, of course, be fully appreciated that nowarning system can be foolproof and that cases are bound to. occurOf air attacks being delivered when no emergency alarm hasbeen given.    Moreover, there will be cases of the alarm beingsounded when no alert warning has been given,    Both suchoccurrences may involve us in considerable criticism, and theoperation of the scheme must be carefully watched and possiblyrevised from time to time.(Initialled&apos;    A H M SH.M13th October, 1940.

AIR RAID WARMING COM IITTE5..Report iThe War Cabinet at their 255th Meeting directed that a review-should be,made of the air raid warning system and that thepossibility of introducing a supplemental system of localized areawarnings should be examined.A committee was accordingly appointed under the chairmanship of Air Vice Marshal R H. Peck,    The membership of the Committee isgiven in Appendix &quot;A1.&apos;.2.      The Committee considered first the present national warning system and the possible methods of making it more accurate andspeedy.J.      We took note that steps are now being taken whereby the plotson the Observer Group Centre tables will be told direct to the fighter Command table simultaneously with their telling to the fighter Group Headquarters.  .This arrangement would eliminate oneof the present stages of telling ana would make some reduction intime lag in transmission of reports from the Observer Corps ofthe movement of enemy aircraft,4.      It entails, of course, the retention of the present systemof central issue and cancellation of warnings over the whole country from Fighter Command Headquarters.5.      Direct telling from Observer Centres to Fighter Command hasthe disadvantage that the number of operators working round the fighter Command table would be considerably increased, and there might be some risk of confusion on the table.    It would, in anycase, be&apos; difficult, if not impossible, to put all Observer centres in direct communication with Fighter Command in this way.    A numberof the long trunk lines would bo involved, thereby increasing the vulnerability of the system to air attack, with the likelihood of breakdown.    The difficulty of issuing accurate and timelywarnings and cancellations from the. central heaBtcuarters to distantparts of the country would remain.6.      For this reason a majority of the Committee feel that theycannot recommend that our warning system should rest on its present basis, even though the improvement to be&quot;obtained from directtelling be effected.    The Commendor-in-Chief, Fighter Command is,however, unable to concur in this opinion,7.     The Committee accordingly considered the devolution of theissue Of warnings from Fighter Command Heedruarters to FighterGroup Headquarters and alternatively to Observer Group Centres.8.     The&apos; latter was found to be quite impracticable for several reasons and in particular because of the amount and complexity ofthe communications which would be required.%.    . We gave careful and detailed consideration to the devolution of the issue of warnings to Fighter Group fleadcuarters.    This system has the following advantages:-(1)    Some reduction in communications can be effected and. this would be of material assistance to the general post Office.The vulnerability of the air raid warning system would thus be reduced because it would not be so dependentupon long distance communicationsj   while the rapidprovision of alternative communication, in the eventof damage, would be made 3asier.    These are importantadvantages.
(ii)    The fact that c Group would be responsible for a smaller number of Darning Districts than FighterCoramanc would make it possible to reduce the size of Warning Districts, ana thereby to reduce, on occasion, the total areas under warning,(iii)    There rrould be closer liaison with Observer Corps Conand consequently, better first-hand information regarding raids over the lend.10. Against these advantages certain disadvantages must bo clearly;appreciated.(i)    It would frequently be necessary to warn districts ina Fighter group area from the adjacent Fighter groupacross which the enemy aircraft were approaching, gsthe present - overlap between Group Operations tableswould not be sufficient to. enable warnings to be givenonly from within the group itself.    More difficult wouldfbo the issue of cancellation of warnings, since incertain parts of the country,^aircraft can approachthrough four different groups, one. the district once&quot;red&quot; could not be given the. -all clear&quot; until eachof the adjacent groups had cancelled the warnings ithed given,-   It will be appreciated that difficultiesof this kind increase the complexity of the system end the possibility or drror.    The Committee were advised,however, by the appropriate comnunicctions authorities, I- that a suitable organisation and the necessary equipment to obviate these  difficulties could be devised and provided.(ii)    Control of warning policy would be less simple.    Theprinciples upon which warnings are given to different    Iparts of the country uec.--ssar.ily vary in accordancewith local expert.nee of air raiding, and the genepel    fconditions of the- air attack on the one hand, and ofpublic morale on the other.    There ere thus, inpractice, frequent modifications in the policy of the giving of warnings.    Dith the present centralisedwarning system it is easy end speedy to make detailedchanges in the principle on which warnings are issued in different districts.    Clearly it would be moredifficult to issue modifications of warning oolicy &apos;      1to six warning centres instead of only to one centre,located at Fighter Command Headquarters itself.    On the other hand many detailed changes will only affect one    fof the areas,    &quot;dalle the Committee recognised thisdisadvantage it was agreed that it was not inacceptablei(iii)    Devolution would, of course, entail the provision of    ^increased staffs and it must be recognised that at    9each warning centre i   24 hour watch would have to bemaintained.    There would be increased expense and,indeed, there is even danger that a warningorganisation comparable to the t at present maintained at Fighter Command Headeuartefs would have to be developed at six other centres,    To justify thiscomplexity and expense, we must be very certain thatthe advantages are substantial.
IX. Full weight must be given to these disadvantages.&quot;i nevertheless the Committee -considered that on balrn.ee the advantages v.-eresufficient, at any rate, to justify a trial of the system, and agreed to recommend that a trial organisation should bo set up forthe issue of warnings from Group Headquarters In the westernregions (Nos. 9 und 10 Groups).12.    The arguments in favour of devolution rould be enhanced if therecent decision, of which the Committee were ini or sued, to provideseparate falter rooms it Fighter Group Head&apos;: uartere - wore to be ratified.    It is understood that this metier is,, at present, underconsideration.13&apos;. The Committee next considered the possibility of providingwithin the public warning or gene re 1 &quot;alert&quot; ,:. local &quot;alarm&quot; orsecondary warning.14..    We have been very much impressed with the strength and extentof the public demand;    especially from those engaged in war production; both employers end employees, for the provision of areliable secondary warning to be  given when the danger of attackon important objectives end centres is imminent, and we are, ofcourse, fully conscious of the limitations inherent in the simpleroof-watcher or &quot;Jim Crow&apos;&quot; system;;    V&apos;e have accordingly examinedthis possibility with great care.15.   We find that it is practicable from the communications stand-point to link Observer Centres to a strictly limited number oflocal alarm posts.    From those  .)cave the alarm could be furtherdistributed by various means,  eg. &quot;07 flag or light signals to roof-watchers, or by bell circuits to points in factories, town centres,of fie as, etc .Such 2 scheme would obviously be an invaluable complement tothe &quot;Jim Crow:i system and would go some way to obviate its inherentdisadvantages;    While it might also be made, in some places atleast, an appreciable additional safeguard to those on the publicthoroughfares,16.    The advantages, indeed., need.no explanation;    and it istherefore to the undoubted cliff leu I ties involved, ana to theirelimination or reduction,  that we P.. v.. addressed ourselves,17-    v;e wish to make it ruite clear the t some of those difficulties are formidable and to submit that they should be very carefullyappreciated by the Par Cabinet before the initiation of the localalarm scheme is approved.    These difficulties are as follows;-(i)    For various reasons, including in particular thedifficulty of finding or providing the necessarrcommunications, the application of the scheme cannotbe made general and will   In fact be considerablyrestricted.    The number or: local alarm posts will be strictly limited end the number of factories and. centres that could be included in the distribution ofthe warming will also be limited.    This will inevitably lead to very strong pressure and public demand forthe inclusion of all those excluded. It will in-practice be very difficult, for the Government to resistthis pressure, and we wish to submit most definitely that unless it is successfully resisted, the demandlor communications facilities will be such that theworking of the air raid reporting system will itself be ruined, with disastrous results to the efficiency of our air defence interception system and. we! th itour public warning.    If, therefore, the system be
approved, it would be essential for the War Cabinet to appreciate that this strong pressure will immediately and inevitably arise, but that it must be resisted and thenumber of beneficiaries of the secondary alarm scheme mustbe restricted to those for whom it is practicable to provideit, without prejudice to the air raid reporting organisationWe consider, however, that those of our most important vitalpoints which can be given a most valuable means of protection!and of maintaining production should riot bo deprived oftheir advantages because the system cannot be extended to all,Moreover, once the framework of the system lies been set up,there is no doubt that loca1 ingenuity will find many meansof extending the benefit of the system to a number ofsatellites who could not be cirectly included.(ii)The danger against which it is obviously vital to guard isthat of interference in the working of the Observer CroupCentres. . The Commandar-in-Chief, Fighter Command, whilestressing this point   emphatic:-1ly, has agreed to allow air raid warning officers to have posts, and compartment withtelephones where space exists or can be made available, inthe Observer Centres, where they can watch the table and issuewarnings to the local alarm posts.and other warning officersconnected to thorn, in the light of information forthcoming from the table. &apos;It is the agreement of the Commancier-in-Chief-, Fighter Command,to provide these facilities which makes possible the provisionof the secondary alarm system.(iii) It would, in a number of cases, be necessary to make use of the communications of the Observer Co: ps Organisation for thepurpose of transmitting these secondary warnings.    Therefromobviously arises the seme danger to,which the Commander-in-Chief , Fighter Command, has drawn our attention, that such usewill interfere with the transmission of operational messages.We are advised by the communications authorities that suchinterference is likely,  in practice, to be negligible]    butwe have felt it essential to r. core that operational messageswould have definitely to take priority over warning messages,and that any consequences which might ensue from thisproviso would rcuire to be defended by H M   Government.(iv) The incidence of responsibility for the issue of secondaryalarm would need to be explained.    While the Commander-in-chief, Fighter Command, would continue to be responsible forthe issue of air raid colour warnings,  including the &quot;alert&quot;&apos;,under the system of devolution to Group Head.uarters, itshould be made clear, and it would be necessary that the pubH-should be so informed, that the Fighter Command would have no responsibility in respect of the issue of the secondary alarm.We think, therefore, that it would be necessary for theMinistry of Home Security to essume responsibility for theissue of the secondary alarm, and to appoint Home Securityair raid warning officers at the Observer Centres.
96l8.    In summary the main difficulty involved in the secondary alarmscheme proposed above lies in the danger that demands for itsexpansion beyond what is practicable will load to encroachments uponthe vital communications of the air raid reporting organisation oftbe Observer Corps,    The effect oi  this would clearly be disastrous to our interception of enemy aircraft as well as to the workingof the primary air raid warning system itself.    The essentialproviso to the adoption of the scheme is that the Government will beprepared to restrict its application to such an extent as will not interfere with these essential operational communications,19-    The Committee consider that despite the difficulties described above, the need for a seconoary alarm supplementing the &quot;Jim Crow-system is so great and the demand so wide and ins Istent, that it mustbe provided, and indeed, that it must be installed with the&apos; utmostrapidity.20.    A universal schema cannot be devisee owing to the widelyvarying conditions.    Different methods will have to be applied indifferent areas.    In many instances local ingenuity will find it possible to combine the official local alarm posts with the principalfactories or with the town centre.&apos;-,Summary of recommendations21.    &apos;.7e roc ommend ?(l) That the issue end cancellations oi colour warningsshould be decentralised as an experiment to Nos . and 10 Group Headquarters(ii)    That, in connection &quot;with decentralisation, thepossibility of reducing the size of earning; districtsshould be examined.(iii)    That an organisation should be set up forthwith toenable information to be supplied from Observer-Centres on which &quot;alarms within the alert11 could beissued to central points and thence distributed to factories or, where local circumstances jiistify this,publicly.(iv)    That for this purpose the Ministry of Home Security-should be invited to appoint at once Alarm officers for each Observer Centre.    These Officers would beresponsible for preparing ano administering schemesfor the issue oi alarms within the area of each Centre.(v)    That all arrangements for - the issue of &quot;alarms withinthe alert&quot; should be on the basis that absolute priority must be given to the requirements of theObserver Corps in carrying out their primary duty of supplying information for operational purposes.22.    Our recommendation for the issue of &quot;alarms within the alert&quot;is made on the basis that th.. fact that such a scheme cannot beuniversally applied is accepted and that requests for inclusion inthe scheme which cannot be mot will be resisted.Signed on behalf of the committee H   PECK.
