THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).O BE KEPT UNDER ^stock AND KEY.s requested that special care may be taken to- --;-* ensure the secrecy of this document,W.P,(40)  571o COPY NO.        /14TH SEPTEMBER,  1940,WAR CABINET.AIR RAID DAMAGE IN THE LONDON AREA.Report by the Lord President of the Council.1.      On the 11th September the War cabinet invited me, in consultation with the Lord Privy Sealand the Minister without Portfolio, to review the damage caused by air raids in the London area toutility services, transport and food supplies, andthe measures being taken to accommodate peoplerendered homeless,,We have reviewed the position, in consultationwith the Ministers principally concerned, at two meetings held on the 11th and ISth September,The position, of course, varies almost fromhour to hourc    Broadly, the present position may besummarised as followsElectricity, Water and Gas,2e      Serious damage has been done to particularinstallations, including four electricity supplystations and the Beckton plant of the Gas Light and coke Company,,As regards both water and gas, the damage tothe mains has been more serious than the damage to central installations, water mains in particularhaving proved more vulnerable than was expected.    Inmany districts gas supply is poor as the result of damage to the mainsoIn general, however, the damage done tothese services is neither so serious nor so widespreadas to involve the impairment of essential services forany long period For the most part, the damage can be repaired or the service reinstated from another sourcequite quickly, unless further and more serious damage is sustained in the meantime,,W.M.,(40)  247th Conclusions s Minute 2.

bDrainage..3,      The damage done is more serious and willtake longer to repair.      The northern outfall  sewerhas &quot;been breached, and sewage is discharging intothe River Lea instead of into the Thames.      Thepumping machinery has also been damaged, and it isstated that it will take several months to repair. :The Minister of Health is endeavouring to arrange that the repairs shall be expedited to the utmostextentaDockso4.     Major damage has &quot;been done in all the london dock areas *      Whilr  some damage has been done tolock gates, etc,- most of the destruction is inconnection with warehouses, transit sheds, and otherport installations,      The great diminution in $raffiacoming into the port of London, makes this damage of .less conseqxience than would otherwise be the case..Unless the ports on the West and North-East Coast,or the inland transport systems  are also extensivelydamaged, the situation should continue manageable..Iteilwajrso5o     Attacks have mainly been directed toterminals and key points on the approaches thereto.A large number of vital points have been hit,particularly South of the River.The trouble here lies, not so much in the severity of the damage at any particular place, butin the number of places bit, and in the time-lagcaused by unexploded bombs, which are responsiblefor mere than half the trouble on the railways.      TheWar Cabinet has already had -under consideration thequestion of ensuring that a due proportion of BombDisposal Units is available for dealing withunexploded bombs on the railways-We regard the railway position with some anxiety from the porlnt of view that, if the rate, of damage was to increase; the position might wellprogressively deteriorate and lead to serious traffic congestion in a short    time      Further, the supply ofcoal to the South of England, which was alreadydifficult owing to the great reduction in the seabornecoal traffic to the South Coast, is bound to be aggravated.      We think that the position on therailways is one which should be closely watched-Food Stockso6,     Damage to food stocks varies from negligiblequantities of bacon, meat and coffee, to half a week&apos;sconsumption of sugar, 13,600 tons.      Two days&apos;consumption of wheat and tea has been lost.

?These losses are less important than thedestruction of flour-mills, cold storage plants,margarine factories, and oil and cake mills   ,situated in the London dock areas0   As regards themilling industry, reserve capacity will be broughtinto use and longer hours worked in order to increasethe proportion of stocks held in the form of flour,which is more readily dispersed than wheat,,  The loss ofcold storage capacity will create some difficulties inregard to meat.    ;;aw Material Stocks,The main known loss is 20,000 standards ofsawn timber in the Surrey Commercial Docks,Before the intensification of air raids,steps had been taken to effect a considerabledispersion of stocks throughout the country,The Minister of Supply has considered whetherthis process can be carried further,,    He intends toarrange for releases of pit props to Colliery Companieson an increased scale0    The Companies would be warnedagainst depleting the stocks so released by consumption at an abnormal rate, since they could probably not bereplacedo    The possibility is also being examined ofdispersing, e0go to the West Riding, some of the stocks of wool in London, wlxlch amount to 300,000 bales*The position of stocks of rubber and cotton is also being examined.aAsM2-&amp;t3J^&amp;JL9JL Homeless Persons^80     An extensive scheme of Emergency RestCentres is being operated by the London County CounciloBut the scale of attacks in the last few days, and the wide use of time bombs, have made it necessary toincrease the scale of the scheme in operation,    Thearrangements for evacuating homeless people to other areas are now working fairly satisfactorily, but arebeing impeded to some extent by the reluctance ofthose concerned to move into other areas,,At the outset the food provided in theEmergency Rest Centres consisted mainly of bread andtea, as it was thought that persons would not remainin them for more than a short time     Arrangements arenow in hand for the LoCoCo to provide more substantialmeals, e0 go , soups or stews090     Besides those rendered homeless by air attacks, provision must also be made for those whoare unable to cook in their own homes owing to failureof the gas supply%   while any system of communalfeeding will also take account of the population of very poor districts, although the needs of this classare not in any way the result of enemy bombing attacks.

The London County Council have acceded to a requestmade to them by the Minister of Food that they shouldorganise communal feeding centres, subject to beingindemnified against loss in carrying out this policy.Their aim, however, will be to make the system self-supx^orting (except, of course, as regards homelesspersons in Emergency Rest Centres, where the food&apos;must be supplied free of charge).      The Minister ofHealth has undertaken to secure the necessary co-ordination between the London County Council and theLocal Authorities outside the Metropolitan area infeeding evacuated homeless persons.Ej^acuation.10*      There seems to have been some uncertainty as to what authority was responsible for deciding whether the conditions in a particular area made itnecessary for the population as a whole to be evacuated.So far,  the only areas from which evacuation has &quot;beencarried out are Silvertown, where the water supplytemporarily failed, and Wapping where there wasdanger from fire and falling walls.      It has now &quot;beendecided:-That Local Authorities requiring a decisionon questions of evacuation should &quot;be directed to apply to the Regional Commissioner to. whom powers should &quot;be delegated to authoriseevacuation in cases of special urgency.Where no such special urgency existed, the regional Commissioner should refer the matter to the appropriate Department e*g., healthquestions to the Ministry of Health;    dangerfrom fire to the Ministry of Home Security.Conclusion.11o      Up to the present, while serious damage hasbeen sustained by individual installations or services,nothing has happened which points to a continuedimpairment of essential services *      But everythingturns on whether we get a breathing   space to -repairthe damage already done, or whether the rate of damage is intensified,      The position in regard to theseessential services must be closely watched.      The point which, in our view, gives rise to most anxiety, isthe position on the railways, bearing in mind thewidespread dislocation which would result from aserious and prolonged hold-up of communications.(intld.)
