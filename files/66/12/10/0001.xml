The Secretary of State for India accordingly telegraphed tothe Government in the following sense : -Further request for provision of troops by the Government of India.2.   India were asked to provide One infantry brigade group by end of September.One infantry brigade group in November.One motor cavalry brigade by end of January 1941.Six infantry brigade groups by May 1941.In addition to these forces and to those already serving overseas, India were asked to prepare a further three divisions -the first to be ready by August 1941and the other two by the end of the year. India were informed that Middle Eastrequirements should have precedence over plans for assisting Afghanistan, butthat the despatch of forces overseas must be dependent on the retention in india of forces adequate for frontier defence and internal security duties. Inconclusion, India were asked to what degree they could meet His Majesty&apos;governments request and what major units they intended to raise in replacement.India have now replied in the telegrams at Annexes A and B.Summed up briefly, India&apos;s proposals are that (a) In place of the two infantry brigade groups asked for in paragraph 2,two infantry brigades with certain ancillary units should be sent to egypt.(6) The six infantry brigade groups should form two infantry divisions,complete except for field artillery, to be ready in May and July 1941.(c) Instead of a motor cavalry brigade being made available, this formationshould form part of an armoured division.[d) India should prepare for service overseas, in place of the three divisionsasked for, tAvo infantry divisions and one armoured division.* W.M.

(a) One brigade(b) One brigade ...(c) One division...(d) One division...(e) Two divisionsSeptember 25, 1940&quot;! To   Egypt,   Sudan  orNovember 10, 1940 J Malaya.May 1941 Malaya.July 1941 Basra.August-December 1941        Iraq, to complete corps of three divisions.If these  theatres are approved  for  (c),  (d)  and  (e),  the  divisions would automatically be provided with adequate ancillary units for service in thekapfl^j Middle East should/it be necessary to divert them there.India&apos;s offer of an armoured division.5. To equip this armoured division India requires to supplement her own production of A.F.Vs. and carriers which is due to commence in January 1941 byan allotment of cruiser and light wheeled tanks from home. The allotment ofthese vehicles would interfere with the home rearmament programme, whetherprovided from the United Kingdom production or purchased in America.Government of India have put forward the argument that they could have the personnel trained for an armoured division more quickly than for an infantry division. The force of this argument is, however, outweighed by the fact thatthe A.F.Vs. for the armoured division could not be provided by the date proposed.We consider therefore that India should be asked to prepare in accordance withHis Majesty&apos;s Governments original request: (a) A motor cavalry brigade for service in the Middle East.(b) An infantry division to be available as a reserve.Details of India&apos;s A.F.V. production progress and her requirements of tanksfrom the United Kingdom are shown in Annex C.Equipment Situation in India.6. Before the war large demands for equipment had been placed by Indiato enable her to carry out the modernisation programme recommended by the chatfield Committee. Due to other commitments it has been impossible to supplymore than an insignificant quantity of this equipment.7. His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed, in principle, that any forcesdespatched overseas by India should be equipped from home supply on a scale to enable them to fight a first class enemy. To date the forces that have proceededoverseas have been equipped from India&apos;s resources, and no replacements havebeen issued.8. India has now embarked on her expansion scheme. To make training-possible she must have certain types of equipment which can only be supplied from the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the equipments for the formationsmentioned in paragraph 4 have also to be provided from home sources. further details of the equipment situation in India are shown in Annex D.3.   From the reply of the Government of India certain questions arise for6m, W-v^-i 7   decision, and these are discussed in further detail below.   The Chiefs of-staff are asked : (a) to approve the roles upon which it is proposed to base the composition and organisation of the forces;(b) to approve the recommendation that India should not form an armoured division for service overseas;(c) to   approve   the   policy   proposed   for   meeting   Indians   equipmentrequirements.4. In order that India may prepare the appropriate ancillary units, it isessential that they should be told for what theatres these formations are to beprepared.After discussion with General Wavell we suggest that they should beprepared for the following theatres : Formation. A^U^^Hy in India. Role.
9. It is clear from the above and from the Government of India&apos;s reply that the dates of availability of these forces are dependent on when the necessary equipment can be provided from the United Kingdom.10. We consider, therefore, that the minimum equipment necessary fortraining should be sent out to India as soon as the immediate needs of the middle east and certain other overseas garrisons have been met. Further, as soon asthe equipment situation permits, regular monthly allotments should be made toIndia from the 50 per cent, of production allotted to overseas garrisons until the outstanding requirements of the Army in India have been met. This allotmentwill require review from time to time in accordance with the demands of the strategical situation.Recommendations.11.   To sum up we recommend that:  (a) The forces that India have been requested to raise should be allotted inprinciple to the tasks shown in paragraph 4, and the ancillary unitsrequired for these tasks should be raised simultaneously with theformations. The details of these ancillary units should be settled at an early date by direct consultation between the Commandersconcerned.(ft) India should be asked to prepare one motor cavalry brigade and one infantry division in lieu of the armoured division offered in para-graph 5.(c) India should receive a proportion of equipment for training purposes assoon as the immediate requirements of the Middle East and certain other garrisons abroad have been met.(d) As and when the equipment situation allows, regular monthy shipments of stores should be despatched to India until the outstanding dueshave been met. Amounts of equipment contained in the shipmentsshould be reviewed in the light of the situation and the priority ofother demands, but provision should be such as to ensure that theforces in paragraphs.4 and 5 are equipped by the time they arerequired for service overseas.(Signed) C.

ANNEX A.Decipher of Telegram, dated August 9, 1940, from Government of India,Defence Department, to Secretary of State for India.(Important.)2177/C 9/8.   Your telegram No. 4427 3rd August.   Before giving you    idefinite answer to paragraph No. 6 of your telegram, we have the following general comments to make regarding His Majesty&apos;s Governments request:  Part 1. Paragraph No. 1. Apart from Niblick, the provision of furthertroops for overseas depends (a) on provision of equipment from United kingdom or foreign sources; (b) upon retention in all circumstances of adequate forces inIndia for defence of the North-West Frontier and internal security; and (c) thelong-term policy to be adopted as regards preparations for the implementation of interim plan and for provision of unit for Sabine. As regards (5), we considerit essential that we should have some modernized forces for this purpose as early as possible, but for the present we agree that requirements of Middle East shouldhave priority. As regards (c), if troops now asked for are provided by us, itwill not be possible to carry out interim plan before middle of 1941. As regardsSabine, we suggest that this commitment requires re-examination as there appears to be no division available to replace Rufus, not to mention the provisionof remaining two divisions. If we are to raise these units as requested by you,it will certainly interfere with provision of troops for overseas now asked for.Although equipment for Sabine has been ordered as now authorized, we suggestno action be taken to raise units at present.Part 2. Paragraph 2. Subject to above remarks, we confirm that we can provide the forces as stated in Viceroy&apos;s telegram 1028-S of 21st June, asamended by 1476-S of 22nd July. It is to be noted that neither of these referredto brigade groups repeat groups and five of brigades were to be on an animaltransport basis.   We would, however, make following suggestions :  (a) that first two brigades with ancillary units be utilized to complete fourthIndian division and Rufus, if as seems probable a brigade of latter should be required to remain in Sudan.(5) that instead of a horsed field regiment we should provide a mechanizedfield regiment which Cell! t)6 ready by 1st December.(c) that instead of the remaining six brigades we should provide two divisions on an M.T. basis, the first ready by May 1941, the second by july 1941. Both would be complete except that only one field regimentwould be available for each division.(d) that if available untrained British personnel, guns and tractors be sentto India in order to enable us to provide a second field regiment foreach of above two (? divisions). The provision of mountain artilleryis impracticable as whole of our production of 3-7-inch howitzers isalready earmarked for His Majesty&apos;s Government, and mountainartillery personnel is being fully utilized in our present expansionplans.(e) a motor brigade can be provided as promised, but we would much prefer to utilize it towards formation of armoured division referred to below.3. Your request for 3 additional divisions can, in our opinion, best be met by provision of one armoured division (details regarding which will be sentseparately) and two infantry divisions, all between August and December 1941,provided of course that necessary equipment is forthcoming.Part 3.4. As regards replacement. Apart from the troops required for frontierdefence and internal security, we regard the field army of mobile troops andmechanized infantry (&quot;? divisions) now in process of formation under ourexpansion scheme to meet the Russian (? menace) as our basic total requirement.
Our ultimate aim must be to maintain this field army intact in India in additionto providing minor requirements from time to time. In the meantime, we will,so far as conditions permit, place formations taken from it at the (? disposal) ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government, subject to automatic replacement.5. As regards equipment. We will reply to your 4520 of 7th Julyseparately, and will also telegraph summary of our main requirements on E.D.T.scale for the forces now offered, which scale appears to us to be necessary for all their probable commitments.6. We will also telegraph approximate requirements of British personnel(officers and other ranks) in addition to those already asked for.7. A separate telegram respecting the financial arrangements will be sentto you in due course.ANNEX B .Decipher of Telegram, dated August 9, 1940, from Government of India,Defence Department, to Secretary of State for India.2182. Reference your 4520, dated 7th August, 1940, and in continuation of our 2177 C, dated 9th August, 1940. We fully understand your situation,but have some doubt if it is realised that we have now reached situation in whichwe have no further equipment of home supply in India on which we can distrainfor preparation of forces for overseas. Until, therefore, we receive equipmentalready indented for by us, we cannot even complete our present expansion, andall our offers are dependent on receipt not only of this equipment, but also of equipment for replacement of units and necessary reserves. We have nomodernised units in sight in India except those offered His Majesty&apos;s Govern-nient. and, as far as we can foresee, there will be no material improvement inthis respect until the middle of 1941. We have already accepted as a temporary measure that Indian units on I.S. and F.D. roles shall have no M.T. vehicles,and in former case no L.M. guns. This, of course, is far below Chatfield recom-mendations. Our offers of troops are, in fact, worthless and misleading unlessHis Majesty&apos;s Government can produce equipment, which in some respects ismore important than men. It is, therefore, of paramount importance that proposals of C.O.S. contained in second part of paragraph No. 3 (b) of yourtelegram 4427, dated 3rd August, should be implemented at the earliestpossible date.ANNEX C.India&apos;s A.F.V. Prodiuction Requirements of Tanks from United Kingdom.India proposes to form two armoured divisions for her own use from theexisting cavalry in India and to raise a third to replace one of these which isoffered for overseas. They suggest that one British regiment in each division,or preferably two, should be equipped with cruiser tanks, or, if this is not possible,with B.S.A. wheeled light tanks, and that the remaining units in the division should have B.S.A. tanks and Indian pattern A.F.V.&apos;s and carriers on F.W.D.chassis. The latter would be obtained from US.A. and fitted with Indian-madebodies of A.F.V. or carrier pattern. India expects to commence production ofthese vehicles in January 1941 at the rate of 150 a month and, if dollars are provided by His Majesty&apos;s Government, could increase this figure to 270 vehicles
a month from April 1941. This would enable all the Indian pattern A.F.V.&apos;sand carriers required for three divisions with 100 per cent, reserves to becompleted by April/May 1942.The estimated requirements from the United Kingdom or U.S.A. for cruiser and B.S.A. tanks for a division including one British Regiment would be158 cruisers and 425 B.S.A.&apos;s- or, if 2 British Regiments are provided,316 cruisers and 340 B.S.A.&apos;s. The question of producing cruiser tanks in india from imported components and with Indian-made armour plate is underconsideration and will be examined by the Roger Mission. It is apparent,however, that all the cruiser and B.S.A. tanks required for the division to be &apos;ready in 1941 would have to come from United Kingdom or US.A. The first instalment required would be cruiser tanks in January 1941.ANNEX D.Details of Equipment Situation in India.It is clear that the dates of availability of the various forces offered by india are dependent entirely on the provision of the necessary equipment from home.India has stated that not even sufficient equipment for the training of these forcescan be found in India; internal security battalions have now no L.M.G/s andall Indian units of both internal security and frontier defence have had to surrender all M.T. vehicles.2. It was agreed in principle that requirements for the modernization of theArmy in India should continue to be supplied as the situation permitted and thatcomplete initial equipment of United Kingdom supply should be provided byHis Majesty&apos;&quot;S Government for all forces proceeding overseas before they leftIndia.So far it has not been possible to give effect to this policy and the shortageof those types of equipment which have to be provided from the United kingdom is extremely serious.3. Before the war large demands had already been placed by India for equip-ment which was required for the modernisation of the Army in India under therecommendations of the Chatfield Committee. Due to the requirements of theB.E.F. and later of home defence and overseas theatres of war, it has only beenpossible to supply an insignificant quantity of the equipment.Similarly much of the equipment demanded to equip the E.D.T. had not been supplied to India before the outbreak of war, and, although this responsibilityhas now been assumed by the War Office, India have been unable to recover anyof the equipment sent with forces to Malaya.4.   Since the war India&apos;s demands have been further increased by :  (a) requirements due to the expansion of the Army in India to meet India&apos;sown defence needs, including such assistance as it may be necessaryto give to Afghanistan in the event of Soviet aggression (approved inPapers Nos. W.P. (40) 179 and W.P. (40) 291).(b) demands  for  replacement of equipment  sent  overseas  with  forcesadditional to the E.D.T. This is required so that the new units raisedmay be equipped and it applies particularly to forces sent to aden and to the Indian division now going to Egypt and Sudan.India have not received any of the equipment under (a) and (b) above,although arrangements have been made, in accordance with the decision of theChiefs of Staff at their Meeting* held on the 24th July, 1940, to send equipment toIndia to replace that sent overseas with the Indian division for Egypt and Sudan,* 0.0.S. (40) 232nd Conclusions, Minute 4.
5. The Government of India make it clear that they intend to maintain theArmy in India at the strength required for the defence of India, includingassistance to Afghanistan, and that the forces now offered will all have to bereplaced. This principle was accepted by the War Cabinet (W.P. (40) 290).Therefore, the requirements of all these new forces must now be added to the already large outstanding demands.6. The expansion schemes in India and, therefore, the preparation of forces for overseas is seriously hampered by the lack of certain types of equipment fortraining. It has already been accepted that training equipment should beprovided for India as soon as possible (W.P. (40) 291), and a sufficient proportionof the 50 per cent, production should be despatched to India to ensure that thepreparation of forces for overseas is not further delayed by lack of facilities toto train them. Any such training equipment sent out would, of course, count asan instalment of India&apos;s total requirements.7. The readiness of the remaining forces required will also be dependent onthe provision of equipment from the United Kingdom, but it should be possiblefor this to reach India in time to equip them before despatch overseas.8. It is also necessary, for India&apos;s own security and the implementation ofthe interim plan to assist Afghanistan, that the outstanding demands for equipment should be met as early as possible.
