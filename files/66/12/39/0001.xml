V&amp;P.(40) 40.9.-OCTOBER 9; 1940. COPY NO.WAR CABINET.4 /Proposed Declaration of Danger Zones offthe Coasts of Italian East African Territories.Memorandum by the Pirst Lord of the Admiralty./The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, has asked that the questionof preventing reinforcements and military supplies from reaching Italian east african territories from the sea shall receive urgent attention. -2. When we previously considered declaring a blockade off the coasts of these territories the Gcmmander-Ih-chief, East Indies, reported thathe could not spare enough ships to make the blockade effective.     Recently hiscommitments for convoy work have only allowed him to send H.M.S. COLOMBO to watch each port in turn for a short period at a time.     Since the forces available are thus too few to maintain a constant patrol, we desire to declarea danger zone off the coasts of Italian East African territories in order to deter all vessels from sailing to ports in those territories and to give our naval and Air Forces the power, when necessary, to sink any vessel found withinthe zone.5. The Italians, soon after they entered the war, announced that within 30 miles from allied coasts all merchant vessels bound for allied portswould navigate at their risk and peril.     At that time it was uncertain whetherthis declaration applied outside Mediterranean waters, and our counter declarationissued with the approval of the War Cabinet.was limited to those waters.     TheItalians have now gone out of their way to state that their declaration extendsalso to our colonies, protectorates and mandates, and particularly to the red sea and our African Colonies.     Accordingly, we propose to issue a counternotice, similar to that for the Mediterranean, declaring that all vesselsnavigating within 30 miles of the coasts of Eritrea, British Somaliland andItalian Somaliland will do so at their risk and peril.     We should at the sametime enter a reservation indicating that we shall not interfere with legitimateneutral traffic entering and leaving the Red Sea.     A draft notice to marinersfor this purpose is attached as Annexe 1 .4. The Italian ports affected were not, in peace time, normal ports of call for neutral shipping.     It is, therefore, a fair inference that, withthe exception of local dhows . and traffic through the Red Sea any ships found inthese Italian waters are either enemy ships or neutral ships directly engaged incarrying military supplies to the enemy.     Consequently we propose that our naval and Air Forces should be authorised - as they are off Libya - to sink atsight, when necessary, all shipping within 30 miles of the coasts of italian somaliland,     The case of Eritrea and British Somaliland is a little different,since we do not wish to interfere&apos; with legitimate traffic passing through theStraits of Bab el Mandeb, nor do we wish to inflame Arab opinion by treatingdhows with undue severity.     We therefore propose in these areas to instruct ourCommander-in-Chief to use his discretion in authorising attacks on shipping, andto have due regard to the safety of native dhows and of legitimate shippingentering and leaving the Red Sea.     The proposed instructions to the Ccmmander-in-Chief are aijpended as Annexe II.A.V.A.Admiralty, S.W. 1.October 9, 1940.
