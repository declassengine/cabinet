ICabinet War Room.
NAVAL   SITUATION.General Review.THE principal event of the week under review was the attempted landing at Dakar by General de Gaulle, supported by the Eoyal Navy. U-Boats have beenvery active in the N. Atlantic and North-Western Approaches and caused heavierlosses in shipping.The first batch of ex U.S.A. destroyers has arrived in the United Kingdom.Home Waters.2. Special anti-invasion patrols have been carried out nightly by destroyers in The Channel and southern North Sea. M.T.Bs. carried out a sweep off themouths of the Dutch rivers on the night of the 22nd-23rd. The Polish destroyerBlyskaivica sank a French fishing vessel by ramming off the Brittany coast, havingfirst removed the crew.E-Boats have been-active in The Channel and North Sea. The Armed TrawlerLoch Inver was sunk on the night of the 21st, and the Armed Trawler Edwina,which wa,s in the vicinity, claims to have hit an E-boat with her 12-pdr.H.M.S. Erebus, on passage, was unsuccessfully attacked at midnight the24th-25th. Four torpedoes were seen and the E-Boats retired at high speed undercover of a smoke screen. H.M. Destroyer Winchester was also unsuccessfully attacked by 2 E-Boats, 6 torpedoes being fired.H.M. Destroyer Veteran sank a tug during a minelaying operation off theDutch coast on the night of the 23rd-24th.The A/S Trawler Loch Monteith was damaged by a mine 10 miles S. ofPortland, 6 men being lost and 3 injured. H.M. Destroyer Vivacious was damaged by a near mine explosion in the Thames Estuary.On the 25th September 11 Blenheims attacked 5 enemy minesweepers offDover. Two of these received direct hits, and there were four near misses, oneof which lifted the stern of the minesweeper out of the water.3. Convoys and shipping have been bombed by aircraft with little successduring the week, two merchant ships being attacked off Cape Clear, Ireland, and h.M. Destroyer Garland off Dungeness.Portland was attacked by enemy aircraft on the night of the 18th-19th, and again on the 25th, when the main water pipes of the Dockyard were cut and theChart Depot sustained minor damage.Portsmouth was attacked at noon on the 25th, with no damage to Dockyard,and Devonport Dockyard and ships in the Sound were attacked at 1630/25, an oil main being burst in the Dockyard.The Training Ship Cornwall, moored in the Thames off Tilbury, heeled overand sank as the result of a bomb exploding under water on the 24th.Five &quot; Town &quot; Class destroyers (ex USA.) arrived at Belfast from Canadaon the 26th.Norway.4. Aircraft from HM.S. Furious attacked enemy shipping at Trondhjemon the 22nd. Owing to bad visibility results were inconclusive. Five Swordfishand one Skua failed to return to the carrier.West Coast of France.5. H.M. Submarine Tuna sank an 8,000-ton merchant vessel on the 22nd offBordeaux, and another large vessel on the 24th, the latter being screened by twoex-Norwegian destroyers.West Africa.6. The French cruisers Georges Leygues and Montcalm arrived at Dakarearly on the 20th September.
Free French troops, under the command of General de Gaulle, escorted by twoFrench sloops and with a strong British force in support, arrived off Dakar onthe 23rd September.An attempt was made to land an emissary, but he was fired on and wounded.Fire was opened on one of the French sloops, and later on H.M. Ships, by the shore batteries and the fire was returned. A French destroyer of the&quot; Fantasque &quot; Class and a submarine were hit, the former being set on fire.Low visibility necessitated ships closing the fort to within 4,000 yards.H.M.S. Cumberland was hit amidships, and H.M.S. Dragon and H.M. DestroyerIngle field were slightly damaged. H.M.S. Cumberland proceeded to Bathurstto make good the damage.During the afternoon of the 23rd General de Gaulle attempted to land atBufisque, 8 miles to the east of Dakar, but met with opposition, and, owing tofog, the attempt was abandoned. The combined forces withdrew at dusk andan ultimatum was issued, expiring at dawn the following day.7. On the 24th H.M. Ships Barham and Resolution bombarded the fortand the Richelieu. Visibility was again poor, and our aircraft spottingencountered heavy A.A. fire and enemy fighter opposition. Neither the fort northe Richelieu was silenced. Their fire was accurate and H.M.S. Barham was hitthree times by shells of 9 - 4-inch calibre, though without serious damage. Aircraftalso attacked our ships. A French submarine which attacked was depth-charged by ELM. Destroyer Fortune and came to the surface and surrendered, the majorityof the crew being saved.The bombardment was again renewed on the 25th, and during the approachH.M.S. Resolution was hit by a torpedo and forced to withdraw. ELM. DestroyerForesight sank a submarine. ELM. Ships Barham and Australia engaged theenemy in good visibility, but the Richelieu and shore batteries were effectivelysmoke-screened. The action was broken off just before noon. Our forceswithdrew, and were later attacked by aircraft when en route to Freetown,apparently without success.Fleet Air Arm aircraft from H.M.S. Ark Royal co-operated in the aboveoperations.The French fleet at Dakar is believed to have suffered the followingdamage :  2 submarines sunk and 2 severely damaged,3 destroyers burnt out and beached,Richelieu hit by two 15-inch shells and damaged by two near missesfrom 250-lb. bombs,1 possible hit on a &quot; Gloire &quot; class cruiser.The French cruiser Primauguet fuelled at sea from the oiler Tanu on the25th about 250 miles West of Dakar, and is proceeding to Casablanca.Mediterranean.8. A further report received stated that ELM.S. Ladybird passed through a controlled minefield on the 19th off Sollum. The mines were small, and, although40 of them blew up, she was not damaged. ELM.S. Illustrious was attackedunsuccessfully by a U-Boat on the 17th, and H.M. Destroyer Hasty, which wasscreening, made a promising attack.Four Destroyers successfully bombarded enemy positions at Sidi Barrani onthe 21st and 25th, H.M.S. Ladybird assisting on the former occasion.9. ELM. Destroyers Wrestler and Wishart, on patrol in the Straits of gibraltar at 0500/25th, engaged four destroyers proceeding East at high speed,but contact was lost at 0547.Gibraltar was bombed by French aircraft at 1300/24th,&apos; 12 bombs fell in the dockyard, the steam generating plant and the diesel plant being damaged. ships in harbour put to sea. On the 25th Gibraltar was again bombed. The A/STrawler Stella Sirius was sunk, 2 officers and 12 ratings being killed. No serious damage was sustained by the dockyard.[21775] &apos; B
Other Foreign Stations.Red Sea.10. A convoy proceeding to Suez was bombed on the 20th. The S.S. Bhima,5,280 tons, with army stores was hit and returned to Aden. Aden was attacked by aircraft at 0100/21st, but all the bombs fell in the sea. Port Sudan was attacked on the 22nd without any damage being done.Italian Somaliland.11. Aircraft of the South African Air Force carried out a reconnaissanceover the coast of Italian Somaliland on the 22nd, and reported one small and twelve large ships, and also one submarine submerging, at Kismayu.Enemy Raiders.12. The French Commissaire Ramel reported she was being shelled by araider on the 19th September midway between South Africa and Australia.Anti-Submarine Operations.13. There have been six attacks on U-Boats during the week.H.M.S. Scarborough and H.M.S. Lowestoft both attacked four contacts off theN.W. coast of Ireland. Two attacks by aircraft on oil patches are also reported.ELM. Submarine Cachalot sank a U-Boat 100 miles S.W. of Ushant on the24th September. H.M.S. Laurentic depth-charged a U-Boat 190 miles W.of Cape Wrath on the 25th. On the 21st September a heavy explosion was observed in the deep minefield off Northern Ireland in the vicinity where aU-Boat had been operating.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.14. During the period under review losses have been very heavy. ThirteenBritish ships of 102,027 tons have been sunk by U-Boat, 2 ships of 2,082 tons by mine and 1 of 555 tons by E-Boat-a total of 104,664 tons. In addition, 5 ships of other nations totalling 16,550 tons were sunk by U-Boat. A homeward-bound convoy from Halifax was persistently attacked on two consecutive days and ships in it were sunk. Five ships of 28,743 tons previously reported damagedare now known to be sunk. Six ships of 44,374 tons, long overdue, are now considered to have been sunk by raiders.  Full details will be found in Appendix I.Protection of Seaborne Trade.15. 614 ships, including 85 allied and 28 neutral, were convoyed duringthe week ending Wednesday, the 25th September. Twelve ships in convoy were sunk. Total losses in convoy since commencement of hostilities are, therefore,British 101, Allied 13, Neutral 7, total 121, giving ratios of losses to numbersconvoyed of British 1 in 300, Allied 1 in 270, Neutral 1 in 355, total 1 in 311.Nine Armed Merchant Cruisers, 34 Destroyers, 14 Sloops and 26 Corvetteswere employed on escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the21st September totalled 830,794 tons, compared with 921,739 tons for the previousweek. Twenty-one tankers brought 210,003 tons of oil of various grades, anincrease of 34,200 tons upon the week ending the 14th September. mineral imports were 286,529 tons, of which 204,756 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig-ironand iron ore. Timber and wood pulp imports were 128,913 tons and cereals were113,349 tons, ten ships being fully laden with grain.Enemy Intelligence.German.16. It was reported that one &quot; Hipper &quot; Class, one &quot; Leipzig &quot; Class andone &quot; Koln &quot; Class cruiser were at Sassnitz on the 18th September. On the same day the new battleship Bismarck was seen to have moved out to a buoy at
Hamburg, and on the 23rd September she was reported by air reconnaissance tobe at Kiel, where Gneisenau was still in dock, Scharnhorst alongside, an 8-inch cruiser also in dock, and Lutzow still in dock with her repairs far from complete.The situation remained in the main unchanged on the Dutch and Frenchcoasts throughout the period under review. The movement of shipping to the westward continued, though less markedly than before. In the earlier part ofthe week, there was a concentration of shipping at Cherbourg, but this wasdissipated, and latterly the chief massing of larger ships in French ports hasbeen at Havre, though there has also been a concentration at Brest, and, for thefirst time, merchant ships and destroyers have been reported passing south ofthat port into the Bay of Biscay area.German U-boats have been very active during the week. Three or four havebeen operating in the North-West Approaches. One further out in the atlantic and three or four more have been reported making a daily total of seven or eight.Italian.17. There is no new information about the main units of the Italian Fleet.Air reconnaissance showed one cruiser, two destroyers and three transportsentering Benghazi on the 18th September, and on the 22nd September there was little evidence of activity in the Sicilian ports, except for the presence of merchant ships and one destroyer at Messina.One submarine is believed to have entered the Gironde on the 21st September,and there seems to have been one off the coast of Portugal during the latter partof the week.German Raider Operations.18. From May to the 9th September the total confirmed losses from raideractivities amounted to 16 ships of 108,713 tons, while a further 10 ships of50,604 tons are also presumed to have been sunk or captured. The largest losses have been incurred in the Atlantic, but recently the centre of activitjr appears tohave shifted to the Indian Ocean.At the beginning of August there appear to have been five raiders operating,but the numbers are now harder to estimate. Since the North Atlantic has beenquiet for some time, it is possible that one or more which were operating therehave returned to German or German-occupied ports, but it is equally possiblethat they have proceeded south, avoiding sinking ships in order not to betraytheir movements. One, or possibly two, are still in the South Atlantic, while oneor two are in the Indian Ocean, and possibly one in the Pacific.19. The raiders are converted merchantmen and probably have a numberof characteristics in common. They would appear to be of between 7,000 and,000 tons, of the cargo liner type, with a speed of at least 16 knots. They havea heavy armament of two or more 5 - 5-inch and four or more 4-inch guns, as wellas dual-purpose pom-poms and machine guns. It is probable that at least twotorpedo tubes are mounted, and a large number of mines are known to have beencarried in two vessels. It is reported that in one case a raider carried two aircrafts, one fitted as a bomber, and one British ship is known to have been bombed in the Indian Ocean. The guns are very well concealed, and outwardlythe raiders present a completely innocent appearance, being disguised as Swedish,or other neutral vessels. In one instance a raider was reported to have atelescopic funnel and topmasts to enable her to change her appearance, and in another a workshop was permanently busy on board making disguises. the crews are large, and apparently consist of regular naval officers and ratings,though it is probable that some of them have previously served in the GermanMercantile Marine.20. The raiders appear to have a long endurance, one, which is believed to be still operating in the Indian Ocean, having left Germany in March. Some,probably all, have had rendezvous with supply ships, such as the German tankerWinnetou, which left Las Palmas in May and arrived at Kobe at the end ofAugust, having spent much of that time in company with a raider in the indian and Pacific Oceans. H.M. ships have made searches for bases for raiders, but sofar without success.   It is, however, unlikely that raiders rely solely on supply
ships, and it is possible that arrangements were made before the War, by agentssuch as Count Luckner, for such bases, and for the supply of information, as atleast one raider was very fully informed about the movements of a capture.21. The tactics of the raiders appear to have been carefully thought out and probably do not greatly vary. In some cases raiders have been sighted at aconsiderable distance in the evening and have then disappeared, approachingagain during the night or on the following morning to make their attack. Theyusually seem to approach on a gradually converging course from ahead, so thatidentification is difficult, and it is impossible for their victims to bring their gunto bear. Fire is opened without warning, shrapnel and pom-poms being emplyed to disable the W/T gear immediately and prevent the gun being manned. Shootingappears to be very accurate, though H.M.S. Alcantara reported that: during thecourse of her action, it deteriorated when the raider was herself hit.German Merchant Shipping.22. There is little to report in regard to German merchant shipping, exceptfor the movement along the Dutch, Belgian and French coasts.The tanker Winnetoti, which had been acting as supply ship to a Germanraider, had only five officers and eleven crew when she arrived at Kobe at theend of August.   The remainder are believed to be employed as prize crewsBritish Minelaying.23. H.M.S. Teviot Bank laid an additional 272 mines off the Faroes on the19th September and H.M.S. Mallard and H.M.S. Sheldrake laid 240 mines offthe Dutch coast on the 23rd and 24th September. On or about the same dateH.M. Submarine Cachalot laid 50 mines in the Bay of Biscay.Mines were successfully laid by corvettes, escorted by destroyers, off the scheldt on night of the 23rd-24th.Minelaying by aircraft has been continued, though on a reduced scale, by both Bomber and Coastal Commands; mines have been laid in the Elbe, off theDutch coast and in the Bay of Biscay.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.24. Reports continue to be received of enemy aircraft operating off the coasts at heights and speeds which suggest minelaying, but there is littleindication of it from the minesweeping results. LL sweeps have exploded 4 minesduring the week, 2 in Hoy Sound, Scapa, 1 in the Tongue area, and 1 off Plymouth.Including these 4 and those dealt with on land, the total of magnetic mines isnow 754.The contact mine total remains at. 529.Three destroyers steaming at 25 knots in line ahead exploded 2 mines about half a mile away from them on the 22nd September in the Tongue area.H.M.S. Vivacious exploded a mine a short distance away from her, outside the humber on the same day, which slightly damaged her machinery. Other instances of mines exploding near ships have occurred, and, it seems probable that theenemy is using a new type of mine which has some form of acoustic firing device.The Tyne-Blyth inshore channel has been reopened after being closed foreighteen days, and the small dangerous area just north-east of the Tyne entrancehas been cancelled.An examination of the torpedo tubes of the captured Italian submarine hasshown that German S type mines can be laid from them, and it is thoughtprobable that the mines sent to Massawa are of this type.MILITARY SITUATION.Germany.25. The disposition of German troops in South-East Europe is believed tobe three divisions in Slovakia; ten divisions in Austria; eight divisions in the protectorate, and twelve divisions in Southern Poland. A report from a reliable source states that the divisions destined for South-East Europe are all beingmotorised.   There have, however, been specific reports of the imminent arrival
of motorised German A.A. units at Ploesti in Roumania to protect the oildistricts, and more general reports of German personnel, material and militarybases at Constanza, Guirgui, Braila, Tulcea, Calafat and Orsova, the last-namedas commanding the Iron Gates being of vital importance to Danube navigation.Italy and Italian Possessions.26. Dispositions of the Italian army in Italy have not undergone any changerecently. The greater part of the army is still stationed, in the north, and the concentration opposite the Yugoslav frontier is maintained. Although there isno direct evidence, it is possible that some of the formations have been &apos;&apos; thinnedout &quot; by granting leave to personnel. Unconfirmed reports of German warmaterial arriving in Italy by train continue to be received, and it is quite possiblethat the Italians are making up certain deficiencies of armament by this means.An increase of artillery equipment and medium tanks would be welcome.27. In Libya the Italian advance has not yet proceeded east of Sidi Barrani.In the L. of C. area there has been much movement of motor transport, and it isprobable that an advanced base, spread over a considerable area, is being prepared prior to further movement. No movement has yet been noted in the areaSiwa-Bugora.28. Troop concentrations opposite the Sudan and Kenya frontiers of italian East Africa are now as follows : (a) Sudan Frontier-El Ghena areaKassala areaGallabat areaOm Ager areaKurmuk areaReserves at Asmara areaTotal     .......(b) Kenya Frontier Moyale areaMega areaLavello areaElwak-Dolo areaNeghelli areaAlghe areaAfmadu areaKismayu areaTotal1 Colonial Brigade Group.2 to 3 Colonial Brigade Groups.1 to 2 black shirt Brigade Groups.15 to 30 light and some medium tanks.1 medium artillery unit.1 Colonial Battalion.1 Group Banda.2 Colonial Battalions.1 Pack Artillery Group.2 Colonial Battalions.1 Pack Artillery Group.1 Group Banda.1-2 Colonial Brigade Groups.31 Battalions including reserves.21111111111123Colonial Brigade GroupsLight Tank Coy.Medium Artillery Unit.black shirt Battalion.Colonial Battalion.black shirt Battalion.Colonial Brigade Group.Light Tank Coy.Armoured Car Coy.Colonial Battalion.Colonial Battalion.Colonial Brigade GroupBlackshirt Battalion.Battalions.+1 Battalion.The Balkan States.Greece.29.   During the past week the military situation on the Greek-Albanianfrontier has been without incident.  The threat to Greece offered by the presentconcentration of Italian troops against this frontier has not diminished   Rainy[21775] c
weather has now begun in the mountains and there are signs of earty snow. If;therefore, an Italian offensive is contemplated this year it may be expected to start soon, before the coming of winter and deep snows render operations in this region hazardous or even impossible.30. Greek authorities have not been slow to appreciate the effects in roumania of non-resistance to the Axis Powers, and, since it is realised that a crisis may recur at any time, unobtrusive military preparations have been continued. Although exact figures are not available, it is estimated that about200,000 effectives are now under arms, a figure which represents over half the fullmobilised strength of the Greek army. In contrast with the experience of lastyear&apos;s partial mobilization, present arrangements are reported everywhere to havebeen carried out smoothly, and, in case of attack, general mobilization couldundoubtedly be completed quickly.Yugoslavia.31. Yugoslavia has lately shown signs of subservience to Axis demands,notably in her provision of accommodation in the region of Belgrade for Germanevacuees in transit from Russian-occupied Bessarabia. On the other hand, thereis evidence that the country will not be crushed without armed resistance, and preparations are being made to resist Axis aggression. In addition to workalready reported, defences are being speedily erected along the whole of the yugoslav-Albanian frontier, and it is hoped that most of the essential work willhave been completed before winter.32. Three groups of armies have been constituted: a Southern group,designed to face invasion from Albania; a Northern group, to oppose attack from italy and/or Germany; and a Coastal group, to protect the Adriatic seaboardand to counter any thrust along the coastal strip from Northern Albania.33. In the areas covered by the above three groups of armies, the Yugoslavarmy has some chance of offering effective resistance to attack by ground troops,since the country is mountainous and not suitable for the movement of mechanisedformations; nevertheless, Yugoslavians inferior air strength islikely to be a deter-mining factor in weakening resistance.34. As regards the frontier with Hungary, which is the most difficult of all to defend, there have been no recent reports indicating any special military preparations. &apos;Bulgaria.35. The first phase of the occupation of Southern Dobruja was completedup to the line Turtucaia-Balcic amid scenes of great enthusiasm. The second phase, scheduled for completion on the 25th September, involves the occupation ofBazargic and Cavarna.Mediterranean.Gibraltar.36. Difficulties are arising, owing to lack of shipping, in removing theGibraltarian evacuees for whom accommodation has been found in the west indies. It is hoped to remove 3,000 from the United Kingdom by the end ofOctober. At the Gibraltar Inter-departmental Committee meeting held on the17th September it was decided that the removal of the evacuees from london should take priority over the removal of those in Gibraltar. There does not appearto be any chance for the present of evacuating the remaining 3,000 from Gibraltar.Air raids on Gibraltar are reported under the Air Situation.The Middle East.Egypt.37. One Italian black shirt Division, supported by a Libyan Division, isconsolidating round Sidi Barrani, where the R.A.F. is constantly harassing them.
Two metropolitan divisions are in the Sollum area, and a small force of uncertaincomposition is thought to be in the Giarabub area. Our troops in touch withthe Italians just East of Sidi Barrani consist of a small mobile force of guns,armoured cars, A/T guns and infantry. The enemy have made no forwardmovement since the 16th September.Sudan (see also paragraph 28 (a) above).38. Reliable sources have recently reported considerable enemy troop movements to the Kassala area a,nd that a number of troops, including medium artillery and tanks, have crossed to the west bank of the River Gash. Apart fromactivity in the Kassala and Gallabat areas, which may indicate an enemy move in the near future, the situation remains unaltered.East Africa (see also paragraph 28 (b) above).39. Little activity has taken place in Kenya for some time past. reports received during the last fortnight show that attacks may be expected shortly.Although there is no evidence that the Italians have brought up additional troops for an offensive, there are sufficient already disposed along the frontier.West Africa.40. The raising and training of new African units continues, and theprovision of white leaders and staff for the four African Colonies is proceeding.The provision of accommodation in Freetown for a complete Brigade group isprogressing and should be ready by early November.AIR SITUATION.General Review.41. During the week our night bombing attacks have been intensified, and operations have again been concentrated mainly against invasion ports and shipping, one very heavy attack on Berlin being a notable exception. The enemy has also somewhat increased the number of long-range bombers taking part in operations at night, and has continued to direct his main attacks on London.Damage is reported in the Home Security Section and has of course been consider-able, but of surprisingly little importance in view of the scale of attack. The onlydamage likely in any way to affect the air situation was caused at Filton onthe 25th.42. The estimated average number of long-range bombers employed by theenemy on his night raids is 220, against 130 of our own and, notwithstanding the substantial air defences, the average losses have probably been less than one aircraft per night on each side. It is significant, however, that there has been an increase in the employment of night fighters by the enemy and that, inaddition to maintaining patrols at night over the Low Countries and Ruhr,fighters have been assigned for special areas over England.43. Our air operations against Italian bases in Libya have been at thehighest intensity so far recorded.   French aircraft have attacked Gibraltar.44. Operational aircraft casualties are recorded in Appendix VI and appendix VII contains further extracts from Raid Assessment Reports.G?eat Britain.45. During the past week the scale of operations of the German Air force has shown a slight decrease from that of the preceding seven days. This is accounted for mainly by the decreased use of long-range bombers by day with a consequent reduction in fighter escorts. Enemy daylight operations have beenchiefly confined to South-Eastern England and the Thames Estuary. On several days enemy activity has been restricted to one major attack or to armed recon-reconnaissances. Attacks were directed mainly against docks on the Thames, aero-dromes, aircraft factories, ports and communications.    There has been no
penetration in strength to the London area, raids having been dispersed beforearrival and only a few isolated cases of bombing being reported from the outskirts.Some of these raids dispersed very quickly on sighting our fighters. Bombs havebeen dropped indiscriminately over the South-Eastern counties.46. On the 23rd and 24th September enemy activity increased and on each day two large raids crossed the coast of East Kent. Enemy fighters predominatedin these attacks, which were broken up by our forces and dispersed after someindiscriminate bombing, but two other raids, each of about fifty aircraft, attackedSouthampton. At noon on the 25th September about sixty enemy aircraft attacked Filton, twenty-seven aircraft dropping their bombs simultaneously.Considerable damage was caused to the Bristol Aeroplane Factory and tosurrounding property. Only one of the three fighter squadrons allocated to thisraid was able to intercept the enemy before the target was attacked, but thirty-sixenemy aircraft were finally destroyed or damaged.47. Each night a considerable scale of attack has been maintained by theenemy, London being throughout the main target, all districts receiving attention.During the first nights of the week considerable activity was directed againstthe East End and the Dock areas, where serious fires occurred. During thelast two nights these areas have been neglected and a more indiscriminate form of attack has been widespread over other districts, mainly West and Central London.Liverpool, East Anglia and South Wales have also been attacked and indis-criminate bombing over other parts of England has become more extensive.48. Anti-aircraft batteries have been in action wherever night raiders havebeen suspected and destroyed four enemy aircraft. Fighter Command havedespatched between forty and fifty sorties each night and flew 3,756 sorties by day.  Details of casualties are given in Appendix VI.Enemy Territory in Europe.49. Bomber Command flew a total of 109 day and 851 night sorties duringthe week and Coastal Command aircraft have also taken part in operations.Weather conditions have not been generally favourable for daylight attacks, buton the 21st and 22nd September Blenheims attacked enemy shipping and dockswith considerable success. With the exception of the night of the23rd-24th September, night operations had been concentrated on enemy invasionports and marshalling yards.50. The attacks on the invasion ports, which include Boulogne, Dunkirk,Calais, Flushing, Ostend, Havre and Antwerp, have been on a very heavy scale and have apparently been particularly successful, resulting in heavy explosionsand widespread fires. The heaviest scale of attack on these objectives was onthe night of the 20th-21st September, when 150 bombers participated.Marshalling yards have also received attention on several nights wi h good results. At osnabruck a violent explosion brought down a chimney, which fellacross the yard. On two nights the Dortmund-Ems aqueduct was bombed, oneburst being seen in the structure of the aqueduct and two bursts in the culvert.The aluminium works at Lauta were attacked by Whitleys, some of which camedown to 2,500 feet and dropped over four tons of bombs with good effect.51. On the night of the 23rd-24th September at least 85 heavy bombers attacked public utility and railway targets in Berlin, and widespread damage and fires resulted. Three gas and five electric public utility stations were bombed;extensive damage was reported at Danziger Strasse and Neukoln gas stations and large fires at the Wilmersdorf and Berlin West power stations. Siemensand Halske, Siemens Schuckert and BMW. (Spandau) works were subjected to damaging attacks and five marshalling yards received direct hits. In addition,thirty-four bombers made attacks on railway centres, aerodromes, docks and factories in other parts of Germany. On the following two nights lighterattacks were made on similar targets in the Berlin area, and on the25th-26th September an attack was also made on the Gneisenau, Scharnhorst andLutzow at Kiel, but the operation was hampered by poor visibility and the onlybursts seen were near Scharnhorst.
North Sea and Coastal.52. During the week 360 patrols, involving 572 sorties and 128 convoys,were flown by Coastal Command, and Bomber Command aircraft again flew a daily North Sea sweep. Visual and photographic reconnaissances were made of enemy invasion ports and movements of shipping, and extended to the coast of norway as far north as Narvik. Our aircraft have made a number of daylight attacks on enemy shipping. A Hudson scored a direct hit on a merchant vessel of about 1,000 tons at Ameland, and another Hudson hit a 6,000-ton merchant ship two miles south of Borkum with incendiary bombs. On the 23rd Septembereight Ansons successfully attacked Brest harbour, and the following day anAnson despatched to attack E-Boats was attacked by enemy aircraft and damaged a Hs. 126 and a Me. 109, and, although the pilot and navigator werewounded, they landed safely at their base. A Blenheim shot down a He. Ill at sea. On the 25th September eleven Blenheims sighted and attacked five enemyminesweepers off Dover, as described in the Naval Section. An attacking Me. 109was shot down and a Blenheim is missing, in addition to which two escorting&apos;Spitfires were lost.53. British and German minelaying continued throughout the week.Enemy reconnaissance aircraft were again active over the North Sea as far asthe Faroes, in the English Channel and Western Approaches. Longreconnaissances were also made round or across Eire, and shipping was attacked in the North-Western Approaches and off the West Coast of Ireland. the activity of German Coastal units has generally assumed a more offensivecharacter. In addition to minelaying and torpedo dropping, attacks have beenmade on convoys, and night bombing and the dropping of mines inland has beencarried out against England.Middle East and Mediterranean.Gibraltar.54: On the 24th and 25th September a number of aircraft, believed to beFrench, dropped fifty and two hundred bombs respectively, but caused no damage to Royal Air Force property or personnel. About one hundred aircraft took partin the second raid, and both high-level and dive-bombing attacks were carried out.Anti-aircraft batteries claim to have shot down three for certain and possiblytwo others.Malta.55. On the 22nd five bombers escorted by four fighters made an abortiveattack on Luqa aerodrome. Three days later eight Macchi fighters were sighted and intercepted by three Hurricanes and two Gladiators. One enemyfighter was destroyed, pieces were seen to fall from another and a third was damaged by A.A. fire.Cyprus.56. Cyprus had its first raid of the war on the 22nd September. Fifteenbombs were dropped from 1,000 feet on lighters at Karavostarsa pier, but no hits were registered. Two aircraft also machine-gunned military billets without causing damage or casualties.Palestine.57. One attack by eight enemy aircraft was made on Haifa, damage beingcaused to the Ruthenburg power station and to a factory. One or two petrolcisterns and an Admiralty oil cistern were fired and two warehouses gutted inthe Refinery, the working of which is not affected.Egypt and Libya.58.   The Royal Air Force have increased the intensity of their attacks onItalian bases to the highest level yet reported.  Frequent attacks have been madeon M.T. concentrations near Sidi Barrani, which appear to have sufferedconsiderable damage.   Benghazi was attacked for the first time, and on two[21775] D
occasions Wellingtons scored a number of hits on shipping in the harbour andon warehouses along the Mole. Several ships were sunk, including a torpedo boat.Tobruk was heavily attacked on several occasions. On the 25th September 27Blenheims scored direct hits on buildings and M.T. and a large fire was startednorth of the wharves. Other objectives have been attacked and a number of aircraft were damaged, and some destroyed, on the ground.59. Italian air activity has been surprisingly small; there were two attacks on Mersa Matruh by a total of ninety-five aircraft, and one on Alexandria. some damage was caused to motor vehicles and the railway line at Mersa Matruh andthere were a few casualties.  One bomber was shot down by A.A. guns.Sudan, Aden and East Africa.60. In this area Royal Air Force operations have been on a scale considerablylarger than those of the Italians, whose attacks were light and ineffective.Diredawa has been attacked several times by our aircraft from Aden, damagebeing caused to the aerodrome and to the European quarter. Military areas and european quarters at Berbera were also attacked and an attack on a suspectedpetrol dump at Jijiga resulted in a small fire.61. Aircraft operating from the Sudan made a number of successful raids.At Mai Adaga bombs fell among fighters, some of which were destroyed. bombers were machine-gunned and a petrol store was fired. Asmara and Massawaaerodromes and Gura were attacked with good results. Hits were secured on enemy troops at Kassala.62. Aircraft of the South African Air Force made a series of attacks from kenya. At Birkao, 140 miles north of Wajir, a number of thatched buildings,including a possible W/T station, were destroyed. At Sciasciamanna an S.79was destroyed on the ground and photographs show the remains of three S. 79sdestroyed in a previous raid.West Africa.63. Fleet Air Arm support for the operations at Dakar is referred to inthe Naval Section. French fighters and bombers, probably recently reinforcedfrom Morocco, operated against our ships and aircraft.Air Intelligence.Norway.64. It is evident that Germany is paying increasing attention to northern norway, several aerodromes being reported under construction between Tromsoand Kirkenes.   Petrol and oil supplies have been discharged at Tromso.Roumania.65. A reliable report, hitherto unconfirmed, states that twelve bomber aircraft of the German Air Force have arrived at Galatz, while another report,also unconfirmed, mentions German aircraft being at Floresti, near Ploesti.Italy.66. Thirty-six C.R.42 fighters and thirty-six G.50 fighters are being transferred as complete units (two Gruppos) to Melsbrouck. Seventy-two B.R.20bombers and five Cant 1007 bombers (probably for long-range reconnaissance)are also being transferred to co-operate with the German Air Force, and arebeing accompanied by transport aircraft.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.67. The force and extent of enemy air attack on this country by day and by night are summarised under the Air Situation. Their effective damage by dayover the country generally was less than during the previous week except forisolated cases of heavy attacks pressed home.
By night London has generally suffered similarly to previous weeks with little variety from night to night, save in its incidence on one category of buildingrather than another, and this variety in incidence would appear to be largelyfortuitous. After London, the Mersey area has suffered most, and a more widespread bombing of other areas towards the end of the week did not resultin a corresponding intensity of damage inflicted.Damage.68. Aerodromes have been attacked daily except on the 18th, but except atLyneham, where a direct hit was scored on a hangar, and at Fowlmere, where aSpitfire was wrecked on the ground, the damage reported has been negligible.69. Attacks have been made on three important aircraft factories. At the bristol Aircraft Co., Rodney Works, Filton, where hangars, large quantities of spare parts, some of the plant and essential services were seriously damaged.This section of their works is of special importance as it is the area wherefinished aircraft are finally adjusted. Sixty persons were killed and 150 personsinjured, when trench shelters received a direct hit. At the Hawker Factory,Weybridge, and Supermarine Aviation Works, Southampton, less damage was done. (N.B. A serious attack on this last factory has occurred since the period covered by this Summary.)70. London Docks and Alexandria Docks, Bootle, suffered some damage which was aggravated by delay caused by unexploded bombs. Two major firesoccurred at Woolwich Arsenal.Damage and interruption of railway services in the London Area continue onmuch the same scale. Among Stations, Waterloo, Herne Hill, Blackfriars andEarls Court were damaged. Main line dislocation, frequently from unexplodedbombs and mines, has affected especially Waterloo and Victoria with many crosscommunications on the Southern Railway, Liverpool Street and Euston.Dislocations of a minor character have been widespread and there has been moreinterruption of L.P.T.B. underground services.71. The Blackwall Tunnel was blocked by an unexploded bomb but has nowbeen reopened. Blockage of roads has been frequent and inconvenient, thoughusually not for long periods, but if continued on the same scale the cumulative effect might be considerable.72. There has been no major damage to Power Stations during the period,but the Gas Works at Battersea, Stepney and Lambeth have been affected, and loss of gas pressure has curtailed production in important factories.73. Rather noticeable in other public utility interruptions have beentelephone exchanges and several main sewers. In two cases unexploded bombsat pumping stations have reduced districts uncomfortably near to a water famine.74. Damage to industry, mainly at night and almost confined to the london area, has been frequent. The most important premises affected are the marine engineering Cos. Works at Wallsend-on-Tyne, where production is estimated to stop for several months; Anti-Gas, Ltd., makers of Anti-gas clothing (Poplar),which suffered severely from blast; Ranks Flour Mills (Victoria Docks), latelyemploying 1,800 persons and estimated out of production for two or three years;Briggs Bray Engineering Works (Dagenham), makers of Aeroplane parts,attacked twice and seriously damaged; and Miles Equipment Co. (Tottenham),makers of metal fittings and webbing.75. Damage to civilian property has been heavy, the London districts mostaffected being West Ham, Tottenham, Lambeth, Poplar and the West End.Outside London, Liverpool and several south coast towns, notably Brighton andEastbourne, have been the worst sufferers.76. A large number of Hospitals have been hit in the London area, butcasualties in these cases have been fortunately slight.77. The toll of notable or historic buildings has not been heavy, thoughfires have occurred in such famous buildings as St. Margarets, Westminster, andHampton Court Palace. Several well-known stores and shops, especially in thearea of Oxford Street, Bond Street and Regent Street, have been damaged.
Casualties.78.   Approximate casualties for the period are : Killed. 1,500; seriously injured, 3,000.For London:  Killed, 1,300; seriously injured, 2,200.Unexploded mines and bombs.79. The enemy has made extensive use of parachute mines during the past week. When these detonate, their blast force exceeds that of a 500-kilogramH.E. bomb, and up to 100 houses have been demolished by a single detonation.Fortunately, a majority have not exploded, and, although their very delicatefuze renders them likely to explode subsequently on a very slight vibration, manyof them have been successfully disposed of by the Naval personnel organised forthis purpose.80. Generally, unexploded bombs and mines have had nuisance value,delaying railways, holding up factory production and necessitating evacuationwithout notice of large numbers of householders.Civil Defence Services.81. In spite of the heavy strain and inevitable casualties imposed, civil defence Services are working and co-operating smoothly.82. There have been some heavy casualties resulting from direct hits on-public shelters. Large numbers of the public are using the tube stations andsubways as all-night shelters. Further reports emphasise the efficiency ofAnderson Shelters even close to the fall of heavy bombs.Morale.83. After some early tendency to find scapegoats for the apparent initialsuccess of the attack and delay in remedial measures, more general equanimitynow prevails. The public is well aware that the attack has failed, and havesteeled themselves to the inconvenience and interruption in their wonted life, even where there has been great personal loss.Difficulties of transport and the inconvenience of evacuation from strickenareas cause irritation, but generally the national feeling is one of toleration solong as at the end the defeat of the enemy is achieved. There is little appearance of nervous or physical overstrain. Fear and shock, attendant on actual explosion,passes quickly in most cases. Without over-emphasis people take the obviousprecaution to ensure such safety as they can and particularly to ensure sufficientsleep. By day they continue their ordinary business. Having adjusted their lives to such reasonable extent they regard the event philosophically, the Cockneyadopting an appropriate bent to his humour, though there are signs of increasedhatred of Germany, and demands for reprisals are numerous.Conclusion.84. It would appear from the general variety and distribution of damage done that the German effort is more to lower the morale and disorganise theordinary life of the people than any strategic plan of concentrating on key points.This is supported by the increased use of parachute mines, which, while causingproportionately wide havoc and dislocation, cannot be aimed accurately at a specific point.
