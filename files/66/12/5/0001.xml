Introductory.WE were appointed on the 30th August with the terms of reference setout in Appendix A. We were instructed to report not later than the15th September.2.   Particulars of the witnesses we have heard are given in Appendix B.3. In general, we have not thought it necessary to include in our reports detailed record of the evidence received. But on account of the special importance which attaches to the views of the Admiralty and Air Ministry onthis topic, we have included in Appendix C statements submitted to us on behalfof the Naval and Air Staffs by Captain Agar and Air Vice-Marshal Peck.II. Street Lighting.4. In the directive given to us by the Prime Minister we were asked toconsider a policy of improved street illumination based upon a system not of black-out but of &quot; blackable-out.&quot; We think that such a policy could best becarried out by :  (a) The introduction of a dual system of lighting in the centres of townsincluding subsidiary shopping centres. In these centres there wouldbe in addition to the &apos;&apos; star &apos;&apos; lighting* now permitted, which would remain lit during air raids, a higher level of lighting, centrallycontrolled, which would be turned off on receipt of an air raid warning.(b) A further extension of &quot; star &quot; lighting, wherever this would be of value to the public.5. We believe that it would be necessary to confine the scheme for dualstreet lighting to town centres on two grounds, (a) because of the increased riskof lighting wider areas more brightly; and (b) because it would, we think, be impracticable to provide, within a reasonable period of time and certainly intime for the coming winter, the fittings and apparatus required if the scheme were widely extended. As a rough estimate, the scheme, even if confined tocentres, would cover some 2,000 miles of streets. Por a scheme on this scale, thesupply problem is practicable.* For particulars of &quot; star &quot; lighting see Appendix D.[21752] B
6. We did, indeed, examine the possibility of a simplified system, employingmanual control, to permit the higher level of light in streets outside the centres,but after making tests we were satisfied that this was not practicable.7. Similarly we considered the possibility of dispensing with the secondary&quot; star &quot; light system in town centres, where the higher level of lighting is to be permitted. But we rejected this course on the grounds that this sudden transition from a comparatively bright light to total darkness, on the receipt of the air raid warning, would cause danger to pedestrians.8. The first point which we had to consider was whether the systems of street lighting now in use are such as to make it possible to introduce a systemof centrally controlled dual lighting in town centres. We are satisfied that thisis the case, though the method will vary widely from town to town. central control is, of course, easier to instal in an electric system than in a gas system.There is a large number of towns, lit by electricity, in which there is alreadycentral control of some or all of the street lighting. In most of these cases the installation of the desired dual system would be relatively simple. Where theexisting system is such that dual lighting could in fact be applied to the wholetown, we think that it should, none the less, be confined to selected centres in orderto avoid too large an area of brightness.9. In towns where there is at present no central control, the installation ofthe desired system will be more elaborate and costly, as it will involve installinga special network of overhead wiring in the central streets. We are advised,however, that, provided full advantage is taken of war-time powers in order, forexample, to overcome difficulties as to way leaves and to permit the work to bedone in a rough and ready way, which should be fully adequate for a temporarywar-time installation, the proposal is practicable.10. Where central streets are at present lit by gas, it may in some cases bepossible to instal a centrally controlled dual system of gas lighting. In manycases, however, it will be necessary to provide an electric system, carried ohoverhead wiring, for the brighter lights or for their control, relying upon theexisting gas system for the provision of the &quot; star &quot; lighting.11. It is not possible to give a very close estimate of the cost of installingthe dual system of street lighting on account of the varying nature of the systemsemployed throughout the country.12. In cases where a complete supplementary electric system has to beprovided, the estimated cost per mile is  450 and for a supplementary gas systemabout  400. Many of the electric systems can, however, be adapted at substancially lower cost, as they are already provided with partial or complete systems ofcontrol.  In these cases the cost per mile would vary between  75 and  150.13. The closest approximation that can be made without detailed enquiry is that the total cost would be of the order of  500,000.14. It is, of course, possible that a considerable number of authorities wouldbe-unwilling to incur the cost of such a scheme and in that case it might benecessary to offer an Exchequer grant in order to secure a sufficiently wide adoptionof schemes.15. The amount of material required is relatively small, and we are advised that no difficulty should arise either in obtaining the necessary material or in.securing rapid production of the fittings, &amp;o, which would be needed.16. In view of the fact that in our directive we were instructed to consider in particular the problem of Central London, we have made a special survey ofthe City of Westminster, as representing a typical district in the CentralMetropolitan17. From our study we are satisfied that the installing in Central london of a system of dual street lighting of the type recommended above, which can beswitched off almost instantaneously, presents no special difficulties.18. We had next to consider what intensity of light could be permitted forthe brighter lighting in the central areas.  On the one hand, it would be desirable
to allow the public as much light as possible, and certainly to allow a sufficientintensity to make lighting authorities consider the installation of the dual systemworth while. On the other hand, it is necessary to avoid giving assistance to enemy pilots. Street lighting may assist them by creating a glow in the skywhich will aid their navigation or by revealing the pattern of the streets whichwill help them to find their targets. Tests and calculations, as complete as thetime available to us permitted, have been made on all these points.19.   Consideration has been given to four standards of lighting : -0002 foot candle* ...      ...     The permitted street lighting (&quot; star &quot;Tight).-002     ,,      ,,       ...       ...     The   lighting  now   permitted   in  railwaystations, &amp;c.- 02      ,,      ,,      ...      ...     Approximately   equivalent   to   peace-timelighting of side streets.-2        ,,      ,,       ...       ...     The lighting now permitted in marshalling yards, &amp;c. (Approximately equivalentto peace-time lighting in main streets,other than specially lit streets such asPiccadilly.)20. An assessment of the amenity value of these intensities is largely amatter of personal opinion, but we think that if a higher level of lighting is to be permitted, the choice probably lies between -002 f.c. and -02 f.c. The PrimeMinister says in his directive that the lighting should not be of a too brilliantcharacter, and we think that -2 f.c. would be unnecessarily brilliant, and would add seriously to the difficulties dealt with in the next paragraph. -002 f.c. isunquestionably a very great improvement on -0002 f.c, the lighting nowpermitted. It makes movement relatively easy and gives some feeling of a lightedstreet, but it is not a cheerful light, and lighting authorities might not consider itgood enough to justify the expense of a dual installation. Although the differencebetween -02 f.c. and -002 f.c. seems less marked than that between -002 f.c. and-0002 f.c, -02 f.c. lighting certainly gives the impression of a lit street andbegins to be cheerful. It would, we think, be regarded by authorities as moreworth while installing.21. We have been assisted by technical advice on the question of thevisibility from the air of the several standards of lighting. The first point toconsider is the distance from which glow produced by any level of lighting wouldbe seen, since on this would depend the length of warning which would be needed to enable lights to be put out before the aircraft would come in sight of the glow.22. It is now known that, at the - 0002 f .c. level, streets are recognisable fromdirectly overhead under favourable conditions at a height of 7,000 feet, and arevisible from somewhat greater heights. This lighting cannot be seen at all ashort distance away. Moreover, no glow in the sky is caused by this lighting, no matter how large the area lighted.23. According to calculations made by Dr. W. S. Stiles from data collatedby him in the course of his research work at the National Physical Laboratory,the level of street lighting could be raised to the -01 f.c. level over shoppingcentres of cities without producing a glow visible at a greater distance than15 miles.24. Laboratory experiments made at the Research Laboratories of theGeneral Electric Company show that at this level (-01 f.c.) the lighted streetswould not be directly visible at a greater distance than about 15 miles. the lighting could, however, according to these experiments, be seen on favourablenights from directly above at heights up to 30,000 feet. This means that lightingof this intensity must be extinguished before the approach of hostile aircraft.25. Tests made in the past suggest that these theoretical conclusions may be somewhat conservative. But in any case we strongly recomend that experimentson a full scale be made before the permissible level is finally determined. Thesetests will show whether -01 f.c. or, as we hope, -02 f.c. would be safe.* -0002 f.e. equals the illumination produced on a surface by one candle at 70 feet[21752] B 2
26. If the tests confirm the figure of 15 miles, the next and crucial questionis whether a reliable warning can be given in time to enable the street lightingto be extinguished before a hostile aircraft arrives within that distance.27. Allowing six minutes for the maximum time which the aircraft wouldbake to cover these 15 miles, two minutes for the process of extinguishing thelights and a further two minutes as a safety margin, the length of warning shouldbe not less than ten minutes.28. To this must be added the time taken to convey the warning of approaching aircraft from the point at which the aircraft is detected throughFighter Command to the lighting control points. We are informed that underthe existing warning system this might be as long as 12 minutes.29. The 22 minutes margin thus required (10 minutes warning plus12 minutes for its conveyance) would theoretically coincide with the &quot; YellowMessage &quot; which was originally based upon a similar 22-minute period. We dohot consider, however, that, except perhaps in areas remote from the regions of active operations, the &quot; Yellow Message,&quot; as at present operated, would offer a.sufficiently reliable medium for the transmission of the important &quot; Lights Out &quot;signal, upon the reliability and the timely receipt of which the whole safety ofthe proposed new street lighting scheme depends.30. Moreover, the longer the period of the warning the larger is the area which would have to be placed under warning. If, therefore, the period were aslong as 22 minutes, large areas of the country would, even in a phase of lessintense air activity, get little or no use from the additional street lighting.31. We understand, however, that Fighter Command are now carrying out an examination of the warning system with the object of making its operationmore rapid and more reliable. Until the results of this revieAV are known it willnot be possible to decide whether, and if so how, a reliable &quot; lights out &quot; messagefor street lighting can be incorporated in the general air raid warning system.32. Whatever warning system is adopted, the risk of hostile aircraftarriving on occasion before the lights are extinguished would remain owing tothe possibility of undetected raids.33. We have considered whether it would be possible to reduce the riskinvolved in permitting a higher level of lighting by placing some limit uponthe hours when it may be lit. We do not feel that any general restriction of thiskind is desirable. But we would recommend that it should be made clear tolocal authorities that the higher level of lighting should be turned on only at times when it is needed by the public.34. We have considered the case of towns on the coast where street lightingwould be visible from the sea. It would in our view be unsafe to give any generalpermission for street lighting in coastal districts, but we think that special consideration might be given to districts such as Tyneside, where there is already a considerable amount of light permitted for shipyards, docks, railways, &amp;c. Insuch cases the installation of street lighting in. the centre of a town may not addappreciably to the existing risk, so long as it is completely extinguished on receipt of a warning. We suggest, therefore, that in the event of the adoptionof a &quot; blackable-out&quot; scheme, applications to install lighting in coastal districtsshould be considered by the Ministry of Home Security in consultation with theAdmiralty and the Air Ministry and decided according to the circumstances ofeach particular locality.35. It will also be necessary to ensure that street lighting is prohibitedwhere the light would be visible from the sea, or would otherwise, owing to theposition of the street (e.g., on high ground), be likely to be visible at a considerable distance.III. Shop Window Lighting.36. We have inspected the shop window lighting permitted by the LightingOrder (the permission has been temporarily withdrawn since more intense enemyraiding commenced). While we consider that this lighting just enables shop-keepers to indicate the class of goods sold, the display is hardly sufficient to attract customers.
37. We are of opinion that, subject to satisfactory arrangements for obtaining rapid extinction on the approach of hostile aircraft, it would increasethe amenity of a street and assist the shopkeepers if lighting up to say three times the present permitted amount were allowed in streets where the higherstreet lighting is installed.38. Provided that definite restrictions were placed upon the amount of light thrown upon the pavement and that steps were taken to prevent any lightfrom the window being visible from directly overhead, we consider that theadditional shop lighting would not appreciably increase the distance from whichthe town is visible from the air.39. We think, however, that it would be unsafe to permit brighter lightsill shop windows in the much more numerous streets outside town centres and wewould propose that in these streets the shop window lighting, when it is restored,should not exceed the present permitted limits.40. The technical details of the method of illumination and the most practical means of defining and measuring the degree of permitted lighting should we think be considered by the Joint Lighting Committee of the Ministry ofHome Security and the Illuminating Engineering Society. We also think that itwould be desirable when the tests of visibility of street lighting are undertaken to include a test of the visibility of shop window lighting, as to which there areat present no data available.41. It will be necessary as in the case of street lighting to ensure that the lighting of shop windows is prohibited where the light would be visible from thesea, or would otherwise, owing to the position of the shop (e.g., on high ground)be likely to be visible at a considerable distance. Wre consider that the police should be empowered either on their own initiative or at the request, of theService Departments, to prohibit the display of shop window lighting whichoffends in either of these respects.42. The Lighting Order requires shop window display lighting to beextinguished on receipt of an air raid warning and we think that this proceduremust be maintained, though we recognise that the problem of providing for rapid and complete extinction presents.considerable difficulty.43. We have considered whether shop keepers might be left to extinguishtheir lights on seeing the brighter street lights turned out, but we doubt whetherthe turning out of street lights would necessarily be observed from inside a shop:and in any case this arrangement could not apply to shops in streets outside the centres where the brighter street lighting is installed. It appears to us, therefore,to be impossible to secure the rapid and complete extinction of chop windowlighting except by means of the sounding of sirens. However, we consider thatit would be unsafe to wait until the receipt, of the &quot; Red &quot; warning beforeextinguishing shop window lighting and that some earlier warning message forthis purpose is essential.44. We consider, therefore, that the question whether permission could begiven to make use of anything beyond the present permitted degree of shopwindow lighting, when this is restored, must await the revision of the warning system.IV. Baffle and Decoy Lighting.45. In the directive given to us by the Prime Minister, we were instructedto give consideration also to &quot; decoy &quot; lighting and &quot; baffle &quot; lighting in open spaces.46. &quot; Decoy &quot;. lighting means the simulation by false lights on open spacesof marshalling yards and other targets, in order to attract bombing from vital to harmless points. We are informed that much useful work, which is provingincreasingly successful, is being done on these lines. This work would be gravelyinterrupted if street lighting enabled enemy pilots to ascertain their true positionand it is therefore of great importance to the success of decoy work that, in any additional street lighting is permitted, it should be extinguished before hostileaircraft arrive within sight of it,[21752] b 3
47. To provide decoy lighting so as to simulate street lighting on a large scale, whether or not the streets remained lit during a raid, would, as we are atpresent advised, be impracticable.48. By &quot; baffle &quot; or &quot; deception &quot; lighting is. meant either the creation bymeans of brilliant lights of a general glare such as to conceal from enemy aircraft the lie of the land or the achievement of the same object by means of a false orcompletely uniform pattern of ground lights.49. It has not been possible for us in the time allowed us to make a closestudy of these highly technical subjects. We understand that a number ofexperiments have been made with deception lighting and we are of opinion thatthey should be continued. We are not aware, however, of any present develop-ments which would make it practicable to conceal the lighting of streets undercover of a general glare.V. Summary of Conclusions.50. ,.The conclusions we have reached are : (1) That it is technically practicable to instal a dual system of centrallycontrolled street lighting in the centres of towns, at a total cost ofthe order of  500,000.(2) That a scheme for the improvement of street lighting should include afurther extension of &quot; star &quot; lighting, wherever this would be of value to the public.(3) That the degree of lighting to be permitted for the higher level of lighting in town centres should be &apos;02 or &apos;01 foot candle, subject to confirmation by the full scale experiments recommended inparagraph 25.(4) That with this level of lighting it would be necessary to ensure thatthe lights were extinguished before a hostile aircraft arrived within15 miles and that this would necessitate a reliable warning of atleast 10 minutes.(5) That during a period of active air operations the present warning system is not in. itself raider-proof and is not sufficiently swift orreliable to provide with any certainty a warning period of this length.(6) That, unless the &quot; blaokable-out&quot; scheme is to be confined to areasremote from the regions of active operations, the present warning system will have to be materially improved.(7) That under any warning system the risk of aircraft arriving before the warning would remain.(8) That the question whether permission can be given to make use of anything beyond the present permitted degree of shop windowlighting, when this is restored, must await the revision of the warning system.(9) That the following preparatory steps should now be taken : (a)\ A review of the Air Raid Warning system sh^oald-hajLUidertaken^h    and the possibility of introducing a supplemental system of/&apos;    localised area warnings shtnTKMbe examined.(bp &quot;A full scale testy of the visibility of  different intensities ollighting should be made in soine-auitable-towai.(c) The views of local authorities should be ascertained and theyshould be invited to prepare schemes for their areas.(d) Experiments on deception lighting should be continued.(Signed) A.

APPENDIX A.Tebms of Reference.ON the 28th August, 1940, the Prime Minister issued a Directive, of whichthe following is an extract: &quot; Now that the long nights are approaching, the question of the black-out must be reviewed. I am in favour of a policy not of black-out but of &quot; blackable-out.&quot; For this purpose a considerable system of auxiliaryelectric street-lighting must be worked out. The whole of the centre ofLondon now lighted by incandescent gas must be given priority. The best methods in the centre of other great cities must also be studied. Localschemes must be examined. Thus the lights themselves should not be ofa too brilliant character. The subdued lighting of shop windows must also be studied with a view to extending the facilities given last Christmason a permanent basis. Where factories are allowed to continue working at night in spite of the black-out, there can be no objection to extendingblackable-out lighting to the surrounding districts, thus tending to makethe target less defined. Consideration should also be given to decoylighting and baffle lighting in open spaces at suitable distances fromvulnerable points.&quot; A Committee of three Officers plus a representative of Home office should be formed. A Report should be presented by 15th September at latest.&quot;In accordance with the above Directive, the following Committee was setup with the approval of the Prime Minister: Chairman Mr. A. Rucker, Treasury, n &apos;Members Colonel W. Vince, Ministry of Home Security,Captain A. W. S. Agar, R.N., Admiralty,Air Vice-Marshal R. H. Peck, Air Ministry,Mr. P. C. Smith, P.C.S., M.I.,Mr. P. Good, F.C.G.I., M.I.E.B , M.A.I.C.E.,Secretary -Major D. Sandys, War Cabinet Secretariat,&quot; To examine the problem of modifying the present arrangements forthe black-out and to draw up, for submission to the War Cabinet by15th September, 1940, a scheme &quot; (a) To enable a greater degree of illumination to be provided in streets,in such a manner that it can be reduced if necessary on the approach of aircraft.&quot; (&amp;) To afford increased facilities for the lighting of shop windows.&quot; In drawing up their proposals, the Committee should take into con-sideration the work already being done under the Air Ministry on decoyand baffle lighting, and should take into account the possibility of extending it to facilitate the introduction of their own scheme.&quot;
APPENDIX B.A CONSIDERABLE body of information on this problem which hadalready been collected by the Ministry of Home Security was made availableto the Committee.In addition, representatives of the following Departments, Organisations,&amp;c, gave evidence before or furnished information to the Committee: Air Ministry.Ministry of Transport.Ministry of Supply.Ministry of Aircraft Production.R.A.F. Bomber Command.R.A.P. Fighter Command.Joint Lighting Committee of the Ministry of Home Security and theIlluminating Engineering Society.National Physical Laboratory.Research Laboratories of General Electric Company.Association of Public Lighting Engineers.Lighting Committee of the Gas Industry.Street Lighting Committee of the Electrical Development Association.Street Lighting Committee of the Incorporated Municipal ElectricalAssociation.Electric Lamp Manufacturers&apos; Association.Engineers   responsible  for  lighting   in  the   following  Cities  andBoroughs : Ealing. Nottingham.East Ham. Sheffield.Leicester. Westminster.APPENDIX C.Views of Am Staff and Admiralty.1.   Statement by Air Vice-Marshal Peck.&quot; THE attitude of the Air Staff is that the best protection of the countryand its war production against hostile attack under the present conditions ofair warfare, in which the problem of air defence by night has not yet been satisfactorily solved, is as general and complete a black-out as possible, andthat any relaxation involves additional risk.&quot; The Air Staff, however, fully recognise the importance from the standpoint of morale of increased street and shop lighting, and support theadoption of a &apos; blackable-out&apos; scheme provided (i) That the warning system by which the lights are extinguished can bemade adequately raiderproof and timely, and(ii) That the lighting of areas which might be of navigational assistance to enemy pilots in finding vital factories is deferred until trial elsewherehas shown the proposal for a dual system of street lighting in towncentres and for an extension of &quot; star &quot; lighting elsewhere to be safe.2. Statement by Captain Agar, R.N.&quot; The Admiralty share the above views of the Air Staff.&quot; In addition they wish to emphasize the importance of no light or glowbeing shown which could act as a navigational aid to enemy surface craft,submarines, or aircraft.
&quot;Further, they consider that the existing standard of exempted lighting(Category C) now permitted in certain naval establishments and industrial undertakings of vital importance to the Admiralty, is the minimum necessary,if present output is to be maintained and that in certain special areas anincrease would be desirable if this can be effected without risk.&quot;APPENDIX  D.&quot; Starlight &quot; Street Lighting.THE &quot; starlight&quot; street lighting to which reference is made in this report,is the lighting of an intensity of &quot;0002 foot candle which was adopted last winter after aerial observation had shown that (except in certain coastaldistricts) it could safely be left alight after an air raid warning. It has beenfound necessary to prohibit the use of this lighting in districts within 12 miles of the East and South Coasts and of that portion of the West Coast south of st. David&apos;s Head, owing to the risk of its becoming visible, after the warning,to mine-laying aircraft flying at very low altitudes.In order to ensure that the permitted intensity is not exceeded and toprovide the maximum amenity compatible with this scale of lighting, it wasdecided that all fittings must comply with the Specification BS/ARP 37 drawnup by the British Standards Institution and approved by the Joint LightingCommittee of the Ministry of Home Security and the Illuminating EngineeringSociety. In addition the specification defines the appropriate mounting heightfor the fittings and lays down the minimum permissible distance between thelights.The decision to instal this lighting in a district rests with the LocalAuthority. According to the latest information, some 250,000 street lamps havebeen or are being equipped with the permitted fitting, and some 6,000 miles ofstreets have been or are being lit in this manner. In the London area, &quot; star &quot;lighting has been installed in the City, in twelve of the Metropolitan boroughs and in West Ham. Seven other Boroughs are proposing to instal it. outside london it has been installed in parts of forty-three English County Boroughs,whilst ten others propose to instal it. It has also been installed in a uumberof towns in Scotland, including Glasgow (Edinburgh is within the prohibitedcoastal area). Where local authorities have decided against installation, thereason in the great majority of cases (outside the coastal areas) is that theyhave not considered the expenditure to be justified. There is, however, some indication that certain authorities have during recent months felt anxious lest the lighting should attract enemy bombers to their towns.
