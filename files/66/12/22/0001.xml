THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1940.SECRET. Gopy No.W.P. (40) 392.September 27, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.POLICY TOWARDS VICHY GOVERNMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IT may not be superfluous to put down on paper some reflexions that arise from the failure of the operation at Dakar.2. The causes of that failure seem to have been twofold. First, reliance on misleading information as to the measure of support likely to be forthcoming,for General de Gaulle at Dakar and as to the will and power of the localauthorities to resist attack; secondly, an under-estimate of the vigour and resourcelikely to be shown by the Vichy Government in reinforcing and organising thatresistance.   We were disagreeably surprised on both points.3. The best that we can hope for is that this episode, discouraging and damaging as it is to ourselves, may conceivably have the effect of stimulating the self-confidence of the French Government and people, and of the authorities inthe French Empire generally. If it were possible to transform any such growth of French self-confidence, were it to occur, into growing resistance to german or Italian designs on the French Empire, the results of Dakar might not prove tobe so completely to our disadvantage.4. In June last, after the Armistice with Germany and Italy, opinion inFrance was stunned and helpless, and the Vichy Government a hopeless prisonerin German hands. The spirit of resistance seemed to be dead apart from de gaulle and his small band of adherents in this country.5. Since then there have been encouraging developments both in the French Empire and in France itself. Certain of the outlying parts of the French empire in Africa and the Pacific have joined de Gaulle. In the rest of the French Empire there has been a growing sentiment that all is not lost and that somethingmay be saved from the wreck. In France a similar sentiment appeared to be growing, even in the Vichy Government itself. Among the causes no doubt werethe increasing rigour of German action in the occupied zone, particularly themaintenance of the barrier between occupied and unoccupied France, the activitiesof the Italian Armistice Commissions, particularly in Syria, and our owncontinued successful resistance and our air attacks on Germany. A good manyFrenchmen, some of them in positions of authority, were beginning to think thatthe capitulation was a disastrous and unnecessary mistake : and that france might yet be saved by a British victory. It is, however, important to note thatthe growth of French resistance was not necessarily bound up with support of de Gaulle, and it is significant that de Gaulle has been most successful in the11171   [21778]
parts of the Frnech Empire remote from France and most dependent upon us for their economic life.6. If there is any hope of a revival of French self-confidence, I would suggestthat, assuming that the Vichy Government call off their reprisals now that we have called off our attack, we ought to be careful not to prejudice any chance there maybe of a growth of anti-German feeling in France and in the French Empire,of which there were some signs before Dakar and which we may perhaps hopewill again gradually be fostered by German action. Indeed, as and when thisshowed itself, we might on this basis be able to reach some kind of understanding with the Vichy Government as regards the French Empire. But that time isnot yet. If it ever came, our line might be that our only purpose in all that wehave done has been to keep the Germans and Italians out of the French Empire;and that if this is indeed also the purpose of the Vichy Government it ought not to be impossible for us to act on parallel lines, though the position of the vichy Government would probably make it impossible for us to act by agreement in open concert. Before the Dakar episode M. Baudouin had already suggested,through His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Madrid, that we should reach a modus vivendi about the French colonies, and we had sent a message asking him to definehis proposal more closely. No reply is now likely to be received, but we ought to watch for a chance to resume contact on this subject. The French Naval attache in Madrid has told us that the Vichy Government are doing their utmost to consolidate their position in North Africa in case events should force them toleave France. This story need not be fully believed; and, indeed, the chances of reaching a basis of discreet collaboration with people like Laval, Baudouin orDarlan would seem at present to be extremely slight; but events are stronger than men, and unless the Vichy Government really think it would be to their advantage that Germany should win rather than ourselves, all hope of collabora-tion need not be abandoned.7. We must admit the difficulty of reconciling such collaboration with our continued support of General de Gaulle. We have recognised him as the leader of all Free Frenchmen, we have undertaken to equip and finance his forces,to give economic support to the territories which join him and to defend them from the sea so far as we can. We cannot go back on these promises, though ifthe French naval forces, reinforced by the Strasbourg from Toulon, should proceed to Equatorial Africa, they would be a heavy commitment for us. But, inview of the setback he has had, it would seem desirable (1) that he should undertake no further military operations in French terri-tory unless it is clear beyond reasonable doubt that the territory is ready to come over to him;(2) that meanwhile, so far as Africa is concerned, he should rest content withthe territories which have already joined him, i.e., that he should keepthe Cameroons and French Equatorial Africa if he can;(3) that for the immediate future the attention of his supporters should bedirected chiefly to Syria, which is more important than any other-territory to bring over to our side and where trouble betweenFrenchmen is less likely to break out.Indeed there might be something to be said for encouraging him to take his forces to the Middle East, where they can fight Italians rather than Frenchmen,and run less risk of stirring up trouble with other French authorities, who maybe prepared to maintain the French Empire even though they will have nothing to do with de Gaulle. I should have thought it was clearly better, from his ownpoint of view, that he should go and fight somewhere than that he should returndiscredited to London or moulder in Equatorial Africa.8. Our main purpose in all this must surely be clear. It is to secure thatthe French Colonial Empire should be healthily anti-German and anti-italian and be got to act accordingly. Provided it will so act, it is immaterial to uswhether it be under leaders that will not break with Vichy, or under de Gaulle.If the situation is such that we can reasonably look for progress in ourdirection i.e., anti-German and anti-Italian feeling there would seem to be
a case for reviewing our economic policy towards the French Empire. As regardsNorth Africa, we at present regard Tunis, Algiers and Morocco as in the same position as metropolitan France, and in theory subject them to contraband and export control, except for certain barter deals in Morocco. But in fact our blockade is not effective; cargoes pass from Algeria to Marseilles and fromCasablanca to Bordeaux, and yet we continue to incur the odium of the so-calledblockade among the population in North Africa and it is made a cause of grievance by the authorities. As regards the rest of the French Empire, our general policy is to exercise economic pressure upon those French colonies which do not elect to join de Gaulle, with exceptions in special cases. If a modus vivendi could be reached with Vichy, and if, in fact, we could be convinced thatthey were organising the French Empire for resistance, it would plainly be to our advantage that the economic position of the French Empire should be strengthened rather than weakened.H.Foreign Office, September1 27&apos;, 1940.
