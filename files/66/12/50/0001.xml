DRAFT TELEGRAM TO MADRID.October, 1940.Your telegram Ho, 862 /&quot;of October 14th:M. Daudouin! s reply J7.1,,        I am disagreeably impressed with the FrenchGovernment1s reply, though I confess I had not expectedanything very different.    It does however emerge thatthey don&apos;t want to break with us, and we should be glad to extract what we can from that situation.2.        Please inform the French Ambassador as follows.3.        Although His Majestyfs Government are disappointedwith the general tenor of the reply, they are none theless prepared to continue the discussion within the limitslaid down and upon the conditions stated in their lastcommunication,4.      .They would once again remind the French Governmentthat their constant purpose has beenAmdp.s to secure the full restoration of the independence and greatness of/PranceyC It is for this reason and because our/ vital OA-vw.military interests demand, it that we have taken and must take every step in our power to ensure that the french colonial Empire and the French Fleet do not fall into thehands of our- enemies,    It is because in present circumstances the French Government are plainly incapable of safeguardingtheir overseas territories, that we have welcomed and supported -- and must continue to welcome and support - anymovement in French overseas territories for self defence against German or Italian attack or infiltration and for collaboration with ourselves,5.        A second point on which the French Government musthave no illusions is that, except to such extent as raaybe agreed in discussion, His Majesty&apos;s Government mustmaintain the blockade, which is vital to their war effort.6.       T7e are happy to riote the French governments determination to retain control of their Colonial Empireand Fleet, and we assume that this means that neither will beallovjed to fall under German or Italian influence or into german or Italian hands.    If the French Government cansatisfy us that they both intend and are able to make thispurpose effective, there should be no fundamental difference/between ourselves and them, since we look forward to theultimate unity of France and her Empire when victory hasbeen  achieved, ^  JJusfaA    Aw., YuAl^c   LV J * 7  r

\ A.. &apos;a e-&quot;   ,uk J-7.        His Ma-ge s ty&apos; s Government are glad to note that     v &apos; )    /&quot;\Prance will never he an aggressor, hut they feel &quot;bound tomake it clear that, if any attack were to be made upon .     J^-1-^&quot;&apos;    ,British territory/ or ships of ear, they would immediatelytake the strongest, reprisals against targets inunoccupied PranceJf V 18.        If the above points are clearly understood on the y  -/French side, His majesty&apos;s Government are willing that /&quot;discussions should begin at once at Madrid.    Me would &apos;suggest that the question of trade between ITorth Africa(including the Atlantic ports of Trench Morocco) and ports in unoccupied Prance should &quot;be first reviewed, andwe would &quot;be glad to examine any concrete proposals whichthe French&apos;Government may wish to put forward,9.        For your own information.    Me think it well to pursue this exchange of views with the Vichy Government in thehope that they will find it to their interest to reach an accommodation with us,    Me realise that they are underthe German Heel and they cannot be regarded as free agents in anything that they do.    Me can hardly expect to receivebinding assurances in writing from them which would not be approved by the Germans and they have so far given us littleground for confidence in any oral assurances they may give us.    But there is no other basis on which we can proceed,given the position in which they find themselves.    Theone safeguard we have is that if they go back on their undertakings, we cam regard any arrangement we make withthem as void and withdraw any advantages we have accorded to them.
