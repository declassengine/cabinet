(UP) !t is r^quested that special care may be taken t9 COPY No.ensure the secrecy of this document.I16th September; IgJjX).WAR    CABINETSUPPLIES FOR MALTAMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES.In March, 1939, the Committee of Imperial Defenceapproved recommendations by the Oversea Defence Committeethat the period before reprovisioning for Malta should hefixed at six months and that supplies should be accumulatedfor the civil population and the garrison for this period.As a result of this recommendation a six months&apos;  reserve of foodstuffs and certain other essentials for thfe civilpopulation of Malta was established at the cost of theImperial Government and in reply to enquiry the Governorinformed me just before the entry of Italy into the war that the food position for the civil population was thensatisfactory;2.      Since the entry of Italy into the war it has beena matter of great difficulty to send further supplies to malta, and the only supplies which have actually reachedMalta for the civil population since the blockade beganhave been a few very urgent items sent by air or other special means and a small amount on a ship recentlyconvoyed to Malta carrying principally military stores.Further supplies are on their way via Egypt but the governor has reported in a telegram dated 7th September that, with theexception -of wheat and coal, the supplies at present in the island (which..did not include those sent in the &quot;Cornwall&quot;)would be exhausted at the present rate of consumption by&quot;t^le end ofOctober.      Stocks of wheat and certain types ofcoaT&quot; are&quot;larger and the january.former would last until the end of3.      Both the Gox^ernor of Malta and the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, recommended in August that convoysfrom Egypt to Malta should be run at least every two months,and that the level of essential supplies both civil andother in Malta, should not only be maintained at theexisting level but built up as soon as practicable to eight months&apos; stock in order that, during the intervals betweenconvoys, stock should never fall below six months.     Thisrecommendation was approved by the Chiefs of StaffsCommittee on 23rd August.      In a further telegram to theAdmiralty, I understand that the Commander-in-Chief has recommended that the process of building up stocks to this level should be completed by April, 192+1* in order thatMalta may then be fit for use as a base of offensiveopera ti ons.k.
i+e      My direct concern is only with supplies for thecivil population &quot;but, in order to make the &quot;best use of theconvoyed ships, co-ordination of all supplies is obviouslyessential and is being carried out in accordance with theChiefs1 of Staff recommendation by a Committee preside over by the Director of Sea Transport and the Ministry ofShipping.     A similar Co-ordinating Committee is being established in Egypt.5.      The Governor of Malta has now sent metelegraphic estimates of the shipping tonnage required per month to maintain the essential supplies of all services inMaltaj civil, naval, military and air force.      Accordingto these estimates 1+0,000 tons of cargo a month will berequired in order to maintain stocks without increasing theiIf,  over the six months ending next April, stocks are to beincreased from their present   low level to a level of eight months&apos;  consumption, the amount of cargo required will bemore than double this figure or over 80,000 tons a month.Although there seems some reason to suppose that these estimates (which are now under examination departmentally)are drawn up on a generous basis, it appears that, makingall allowances, the problem of convoying a sufficientvolume of supplies to Malta to implement the Chiefs&apos; ofStaff recommendation referred to in paragraph 3 above bythe date suggested by the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean,namely the beginning of April next, will be a serious one.6.      I do not myself make any recommendation on the major question of policy because the issues involved, that jis whether Malta is to be put in a position to become an offensive base and whether the convoys necessary to achieve this are to be provided, are primarily the concern of others;    but I think that the Cabinet should be aware of the magnitude of the operations which are required tocarry out the proposed policy, and I submit that themaintenance of supplies to Malta must in any case be given Ithe highest order of shipping priority.L.Colonial Office.16th September,191+0.
