They amounted to no morethan 3 million tons0Adhering, however, for the time being to basis of calculation similarto those adopted in my recent memoranda and subject to similar provisoes(e.g. that the conditions of our ports and of internal transport do not materially deteriorate) the position may be briefly set out as follows;-Million tons,(a) Imports in first year of war 43&apos;g&quot;(b) Ministry of Shipping estimate ofimports in second year of war, preparedfor a meeting of Ministers on 1st August,1940, based on certain assumptions, oneof which was that the losses of the year would amount to 5*2 million deadweighttons:Mils, tons (Approx.)Ministry of Supply 23Ministry of Food 18.miscellaneous (Bc of T,) 1.42.9   Scaled down to        42(c) The Ministry of Shipping haveprovisionally estimated on similarassumptions, including the annual rateof loss implicit in(b), that importsim the third year of war will fall to 34(d) Imports as estimated at (a) for thirdyear of war, but assuming current rateof loss, which is approximately 10/6 inexcess of 5*2 million deadweight tons,assumed in the Ministry of Shippkngestimates $2(e) Imports in 1917, ioe0 the last completeyear of the four years&apos; war, when thepopulation to be supplied was about-^0 less 34The above figures make no allowance for increased demands on shipping for military purposes in the Middle East or elsewhere.So long as the Mediterranean remains closed, the round voyage to Egypt,with the ships available, occupies--about six months, and the furtherinroads into the import programmes, which appear to be to some extentinevitable, may call for an early and drastic reduction of those programmes.R H c ministry of Shipping,30th October, 1940,,
