this document is the property of his britannic majestvs governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.  September 1940.SECEET.W.P. (^0) 394.September 28, 1940.TQ BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SPAIN, GIBRALTAR AND MOROCCO.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IF the plans for the invasion of the United Kingdom are finally abandonedfor this year, Germany will be almost certain to attempt a diversion.2. It is conceivable that Hitler may seek to get at Egypt through the balkans, Turkey, Syria and Palestine and with that possibility this paper is not concerned.3. The more probable area, however, for such diversion as Hitler may wishto create is the Mediterranean, where two main possibilities are open to theGerman Government. One is co-operation with the Italians against Egypt andour position in the Middle East. The reply to this is a military one, but theconsequences of setbacks upon our diplomatic position would be so serious thatI hope we shall proceed steadily with the reinforcement of Egypt on as large a scale as the prospects of an attack on the United Kingdom may permit.4. The other likely direction of a German move is towards the iberian peninsula. Great pressure will be placed on Spain to throw in her fortunes withthe Axis and to permit the passage of German troops through Spain to portugal and Gibraltar with the possibility of an African venture in the background.A march through Spain, an attack on Gibraltar, the occupation of points on the atlantic coast, and perhaps a move in Morocco, might be a fairly easy task forthe German army and would be quite sufficiently spectacular to carry the Germanpeople over the winter. Our efforts to counter this plan must lie mainly in thepolitical and economic fields, and the key to the position lies mainly in Madrid,partly in Morocco, and partly in Vichy.5. In Spain the struggle between the interventionists (Suner and theFalangist party) and the non-interventionists (the Minister for Foreign affairs and the army) is reaching its climax with Franco still inclined to thenon-interventionist side. Suner will certainly return from Berlin with grandioseideas as to- (1) the part which Spain will play in the new Europe;(2) the economic benefits which this part will bring; and(3) the prospects of expansion in Africa, which will be assured if Spain- .        will throw in its lot with the Axis.6. This glittering programme will be hard for the non-interventionists to resist, and they must have some support.7. On the political side the only concessions which can be made are in respectof (a) Gibraltar and (b) Morocco.11172   [21779] copy No.
28. Gibraltar. Sir S. Hoare, has already been authorised to inform theSpanish Government that, whilst we will not discuss the future of Gibraltarduring the war, we will discuss it with Spain after the war. Sir S. Hoare nowwants us to make a public statement in this sense.*9. Morocco. As regards Morocco, the position is that the Spaniardsconsider that they have a claim against the French for certain zones in Moroccounder the Franco-Spanish Conventions of 1904 and 1912. A note on the Spanishclaims is attached as Annex I to this memorandum. Before the de Gaullemovement got under way, Sir S. Hoare was authorised to tell the Spaniards thatthe question of the zones was a matter between France and Spain; that we couldnot be a party to giving away French territory; but that, in the event of troubleoccurring, we should prefer to see Spanish troops maintaining order rather thanGerman or Italian troops. This formula was varied when the de Gaulle movementwas on the up grade, and Sir S. Hoare has now informed Senor Beigbeder thatwe desire French Morocco to remain quiet; that we cannot check the de Gaullemovement; but that we have no reason to suppose that this movement will leadto disorder in French Morocco, which we are most anxious to avoid and will do nothing to promote.10. At the time when this message was given we were not prepared to pressGeneral de Gaulle to make any concessions to the Spaniards over the zones. Butwe were not contemplating, and nor was General de Gaulle, an immediate move in Morocco, because there was good reason to believe that such a step would bringSpain under German pressure into the war and because we had not the necessaryforces available to hold the position in Morocco against external attack or internalunrest if General de Gaulle intervened there. Moreover, it was becoming clearthat, from the Spanish angle, a concession over the zones was likely to be theprice which General de Gaulle might have to pay for the spread of the free french movement in North Africa. In any event, so long as Spanish aspirationsin Morocco remain completely unsatisfied, Madrid will be continuously tempted to adopt any policy which promises their satisfaction.11. The failure of de Gaulle before Dakar has relegated to the background the possibility of his movement spreading in Morocco and to that extent we havea greater freedom of manoeuvre vis-a-vis the Spanish Government. We can nowgive a further assurance to the Spanish Government that we do not desire tofoment any disorder in Morocco. At the time of the Dakar operation we told the Spaniards that we desired to see amicable arrangements between France and spain over the zones. I should now like to go rather further and say that theSpanish claims under the conventions of 1904 and 1912 must be settled between france and Spain, but that, though the question does not directly concern us atthe present moment, we are in principle sympathetic to the Spanish case.12. Our main method of persuasion lies, however, in the economic sphere.We can offer Spain a livelihood within the limits agreed by the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare. Viewed from this angle Spain is the first country to whichwe can apply the policy that so long as a Government remains relativelyindependent of the Axis its people can be sure of bread and a measure of economicsecurity. There is already a proposal on foot to enable Spain to get dollar creditsfrom the United States, and provided that the Minister for Economic Warfaredoes not feel difficulty about applying a certain elasticity to Spanish requirementsof certain raw materials, it can be represented to the Spaniards that thepreservation of neutrality will bring them, certain solid though unspectaculareconomic benefits.13. I have had repeated cause to be grateful to the Minister for economic warfare for the assistance that he has given to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atMadrid over particular difficulties in connexion with the operation of the blockadethat must constantly arise. Experience, however, has. shown that, with the bestwill in the world, much delay and consequent irritation has been inevitable undera system which necessitates constant reference on points of detail from Madridto London and much departmental discussion here in conditions not made easier* Owing to an error Madrid gave a wrong reference and it is not clear what Sir S. Hoareactually said to the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs about Gibraltar. The point is beingcleared up.
[21779]by frequent air raids. Such delay frequently vitiates the value of concessionsmade and does much to nullify both the efforts made by His Majesty&apos;.ambassador at Madrid and the general policy that I believe the Cabinet desires tomake effective. I am driven to the conclusion that immediate means must be found for granting a wider measure of discretion to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atMadrid to deal with day-to-day questions in regard to ships and cargoes raised with him by the Spanish Government, and that in the Ambassador&apos;s words (inhis telegram No. 248, Saving), &quot; cause constant storms to spring up over blockadeI questions.&quot; I do not believe that such delegation of authority need present difficulty or could appreciably weaken the effect of our general blockade policy on germany and Italy. I should be very well content, if some such system were introduced, for its effect upon Spanish imports to be reviewed at the end of an agreed period.14. As regards Morocco, the policy hitherto has been that Morocco isenemy-controlled territory and has to be treated as such. It is consequentlysubject to the blockade. There are, however, various commodities, and, inparticular, phosphates, for the supply of which Spain looks to Morocco.A system of barter by which Spain could obtain the phosphates she requires isalready under consideration, and it may be necessary to agree to some furtherderogations from the strict policy of contraband control between Trench Moroccoand Spain. Our principal object is to keep the Germans and Italians out ofMorocco, and if for that purpose it is necessary that Morocco should retain itsunity, and both its power and its willingness to resist attack, it may well be wise toagree to its retaining a measure of economic prosperity; and we should not mindtoo much whether this purpose is achieved under General Nogues, under someother representative of Vichy, or under de Gaulle.15. As regards Vichy, much depends on the policy which it may now bedecided to pursue as a result of de Gaulle&apos;s failure before Dakar. On this, Ihave circulated another paper to my colleagues. But as far as Morocco isconcerned, it is clearly to our interest to encourage in every way those elements in the French Government which may be unwilling to give in to every Axisdemand in North Africa and who might favour a policy of resistance in Morocco.16. As Sir S. Hoare has proposed that a public statement should be issued to cover Gibraltar, a tentative draft, which also covers Morocco, is submitted as annex II.17.   I therefore ask my colleagues (1) To approve the issue of a statement dealing with Gibraltar and Moroccoon the lines of the draft in Annex II.(2) To approve the line suggested in regard to Morocco both in its politicaland its economic aspects.(3) To approve the delegation of authority to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in madrid to deal with  certain blockade matters as proposed  inparagraph 13.H.Foreign Office, September 28, 1940.Note. This paper was written before I received the important memorandum which I print below as Annex III. I have telegraphed to Sir S. Hoare to askwhat he would have in mind by way of a friendly statement that would help\ Colonel Beigbeder without compromising either ourselves or France.  I have at the same time sent him for comment the text of the statement in Annex II,while making plain that the matter has not yet been considered by theCabinet. In view of the other matters dealt with in this paper, I should not,however, propose to delay bringing it to the Cabinet pending his reply.
ANNEX I.Spanish Claims on French Morocco.THE; boundary between the French and Spanish Zones of Morocco was originally defined in the Convention between France and Spain signed on the3rd October, 1904, at Paris. The occupation of the Zone by the Spanishauthorities was not to become immediately effective. Negotiations in regard tothe exact conditions under which the Spanish forces should occupy the Zone didnot commence until some years later, at the time of the Moroccan troubles of 19] and 1911.2. In connexion with these new negotiations the French Government raised the question of a rectification of the line of partition between the French and spanish Zones as drawn in the Franco-Spanish Convention of 1904. The french in the first place desired to obtain compensation for the sacrifices which theyhad been compelled to make to Germany in the Congo. In the second place theFrench claimed that the original line of partition took insufficient account of the true conformation of the territory through which it passed. The section of thefrontier which the French were particularly anxious to rectify was that in the region of the river Ouerga. The French claimed that the frontier line, instead of following, as was probably intended, the true watershed of the rivers runningsouthwards into the Inauen and Sebu valleys, cut across those rivers, divided inhalf several important Moorish tribes and brought under Spanish hands a regionlying to the south of a high chain of mountains and therefore not easilycontrollable by Spain. The French, therefore, demanded rectifications of thefrontier which would leave the important valley of the Ouerga within the french zone. The negotiations continued for many months, and the Spaniards strongly opposed the rectifications proposed byr the French. They doubted whether anysubstantial advance had been made in the geographical knowledge of the regionsince 1904; they did not admit that the Ouerga valley was difficult of access to spain; and scouted the arguments based on the alleged fact that the existing linedivided important tribes in half. They felt that what the French desired was to push Spanish influence still further back into the mountains and to retain in theirown hands fertile regions which the French, with their eyes open, had offered to spain in 1904 to replace the line of the River Sebu then claimed by Spain. Afterlengthy negotiations, in which His Majesty&apos;s Government played at times amediatory role, agreement was finally reached which substantially met all theFrench territorial demands. The French in return agreed to give favourable consideration to certain financial proposals regarding the Spanish Zone and tocertain proposals in regard to the territory of Ifni.3. The agreement was finally signed in November 1912. The territorialresult of this treaty was to move the central portion of the southern boundary ofthe Spanish Zone very considerably to the north, thereby depriving the Spaniardsof the valley of the Ouerga, which is inhabited by the Beni Zerual, and also oflarge tracts of country further east inhabited by the Beni Guezennaia, to both ofwhich zones the Spanish Government now lay claim.4. It may be well to acid that the 1912 frontier was not delimited on theground for many years, and one of the provisions of the treaty which concludedthe Riff troubles in 1926 made provision that the 1912 frontier should bedelimited. The delimitation appears to have given particular trouble in theterritory of the Beni Zerual, where the French have occupied some territory which the Spaniards consider should properly be in the Spanish Zone.
ANNEX II.Draft Statement.IN connexion with the visit of the Spanish Minister of the Interior to Berlin,the German and Italian propaganda agencies have been making much play withthe position in Gibraltar and in Morocco. &apos;   :In view of this campaign, it is desirable to put on record the position ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government.As regards Gibraltar, His Majesty&apos;s Government informed the SpanishGovernment earlier in the year that while, for obvious reasons, they could not discuss the status of Gibraltar during the war, they were quite prepared toconsider it after the war in consultation with the Spanish Government.As regards Morocco, His Majesty&apos;s Government have no designs in that territory, and would only be concerned if German or Italian influence there was permitted to spread. They therefore trust that Morocco will remain quiet andprosperous, and that any questions arising there will be decided between Franceand Spain, the two Powers which have a direct and legitimate interest in that territory.ANNEX III.Memorandum from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Madrid.COLONEL BEIGBEDER asked me to go out with him on Saturdayafternoon. When I arrived at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs I found that hehad arranged that we should drive to a ruined villa of the Royal Family, where we could talk at length and undisturbed. We certainly could not have found amore solitary spot. Leaving the car at the gate, he and I walked about thedeserted garden for the best part of two hours. The conversation raised certain important and urgent issues and I am, therefore, reporting it to you in detail.Colonel Beigbeder is convinced that we are on the brink of a turning pointin Spanish policy. Hitherto, there have been two contending parties in theGovernment and the country, the party of the short war led by Senor Suner, andthe party of the long war led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Senor Sunerand the young men of the Falange have staked their fortunes upon the war endingthis autumn and ending with a complete German victory. Colonel Beigbeder hasequally staked his fortunes upon the war not ending quickly and not ending ina complete German victory. According to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, there seems now an excellent chance of his own policy being confirmed and of SenorSuner&apos;s being discredited. If this result comes about, the Falange defeat willseem all the more crushing after the much-advertised visit of its leader to Berlin.Colonel Beigbeder added that the visit had been planned by Herr von Stohrer,the German Ambassador, for two purposes, firstly, to involve Spain in thecontinental bloc, and, secondly, and perhaps even more important in the ambassador&apos;s eyes, to rehabilitate von Stohrer, who had been steadily losingground in Madrid for many weeks past.It will be seen from this that Colonel Beigbeder contemplates a victory overSenor Suner in the next few weeks. On the assumption that this takes place,what is to be the next step ? Will our friends here, foremost amongst them theMinister for Foreign Affairs, be able to consolidate the ground that they will have gained? This all-important question he proceeded to discuss with me with afrankness and even indiscretion that I cannot exaggerate. This was his argument.A long war would be not only very unpopular in Spain, it might well be disastrous.His victory over Suner would thus be on an unpopular issue, and the germans would have ready to hand the easiest and most effective kind of propaganda. Theywould say that, when all the continent wanted peace, Great Britain alone was continuing the war, that Spain would be finally ruined by the war and that if atthe end Great Britain was victorious she would bring back the Government of the
&quot;Reds.&quot; Colonel Beigbeder, seeing the great danger of propaganda of this kindimpressed upon me the vital importance of forestalling- it at once, and of strengthening the hands of our potential friends in Spain. If we were to succeedhe said, we must be at once preparing the ground for action to be taken imme-diately after it became-clear in-October that the war was going on through thewinter. I asked him for concrete suggestions that we could put into action without delay. His answer was &quot;Start immediately a steady and consistentcampaign upon the Spanish wireless about the economic help that you are giving to 1 Spain. Discussions that began over oil are going well, but owing to the impossibility of getting anything into Senor Suner&apos;s newspapers you must rely upon the B.B.C. broadcasts in Spanish. Secondly, we should be ready to make a sympathetic statement as to our political relations with Spain at the rightmoment, also on the wireless. The statement should be designed to keep Spain outof the continental bloc and to make it clear that she can hope for a future outsideit. As things are, she is being promised economic stability, Gibraltar and FrenchMorocco, if she joins the bloc. She is also being threatened with every kind ofcatastrophe if she keeps out of it. Our statement, therefore, should be assympathetic as ever we can make it to Spanish ideals and aspirations.&quot;In order to discover Colonel Beigbeder&apos;s inner mind, I pressed him furtherabout Spanish aspirations. The result was to show once again that it wasMorocco rather than Gibraltar that was chiefly in his mind. I pointed out our difficulties in dealing with territory that is a French protectorate. His answertook the form of insisting that in the peace treaty there were bound to be greatchanges in Africa, and that if the French Empire at that time remained intactthere should surely.be ways of making exchanges of territory and of compensatingFrance for any territory she might lose in Morocco. The effect of this further discussion.was to give me the impression that it would not be impossible to makea really friendly statement of the kind contemplated by Colonel Beigbeder withoutcompromising either ourselves or France.Such a statement would, in Colonel Beigbeder&apos;s view, have a very great effect upon the anti-German party in Spain. There was now in his opinion none of theAnglophobia that existed in Spain two or three months ago. Xenophobia hadtaken its place, and xenophobia was now principally directed against theGermans. If we could at the right moment capitalise this change of opinion and make it clear that Spain had a great future outside the continental bloc, weshould help to make Spain take the right turning at the cross roads that wehad now reached. Having taken this turning, two things might happen on theroad. The Spanish Government, supported by a more solid public opinion, mightbe able to stand up to future German demands. Or if it were still too weak to resist a German demand for the right of passage, it would at least have behind it a great body of national resentment that would make the way of the Germansdifficult and would end as the French right of passage ended in 1808, i.e., in another Peninsular War. In either event therefore we had everything to gain by rallying the Spanish forces of xenophobia. Finally, he said that if we acted as he proposed, and we and he exploited to the full the field of closer relationsbetween the two countries, he believed we could develop the Anglo-PortugueseAlliance into a triple alliance to cover the Iberian Peninsula. His fear, however,was that no one in London would take these possibilities either seriously enoughor broadly enough to make it possible for them to be developed with the force andspeed that were required. Why, he asked, did I not myself go to London to putthese big issues before the Government?My answrer was that I felt that my departure from Madrid at this momentwould be so much dramatised by friends as well as enemies that it might do more harm than good. Colonel Beigbeder was, however, insistent upon this point, andI feel that I must put it to you. I could, of course, take advantage of thesuggestion with which, you remember, j^ou yourself agreed some weeks ago thatI should come to London. I feel, however, that I ought not to leave Madrid unless it is absolutely necessary, and if you accept the views that I am now expressingit would seem better for me to remain here. If, however, you have doubts andmisgivings then I feel that I ought to try to remove them by personal discussion in London.I now make certain comments upon this conversation. From start to finishit was obvious to me that Colonel Beigbeder meant, it to be regarded as a long
step forward in our direction. It was based on the assumption that Seilor Suner&apos;policy of the short war would collapse in the course of the next few weeks.A further point to remember, particularly when we are apt to recall ColonelBeigbeder&apos;s tendencies to facile optimism, is that in this instance his and ourfortunes are tied up together. Events have so moved that he has now socompletely burnt his boats with the germanophil party that not only his successbut also his political life is involved in our success. He has everything to loseif he lets us down. General Franco may, of course, throw him over. CertainlyGeneral Franco&apos;s recent speeches have shown his ideological sympathy with otherdictators. None the less I hear from all sides that in the last resort he wishes tokeep Spain not only out of the war, but also out of the continental bloc.Supposing, however, that he and Colonel Beigbeder eventually let us down or were not able to play their part in fostering better relations between our twocountries, it does not seem to me that we can lose anything by carrying out thetwo concrete proposals that I am making, namely, an intensive wireless campaign of economic propaganda, and at the end of it a public statement of sympathy with Spain. Any promises that we make or any economic help that we might givewould be entirely dependent upon a friendly Spain. If an unfriendly Govern-ment came into power or if our own friends betrayed us, neither would ourpromises stand nor our economic help continue. This being so, it seems to me thatthere is very little risk involved in the action that I am recommending. I must emphasise, however, that it must in the first instance be unilateral action on our part. One thing that we cannot do with the Spanish Government is to impose upon them certain preliminary conditions. If, for instance, we say to them&quot;You must stop the German propaganda in the press before we can make any statement of sympathy towards Spain,&quot; we are making a condition which theycannot carry out and which if they did carry out, might even react disastrouslyagainst our own interests. With the Germans on the Pyrenees they would beafraid to fulfil it and it is quite possible that, if they made the attempt to fulfil it,the immediate result would be a German ultimatum demanding the right of passage. You may think that this is an unsatisfactory state of affairs. I agree,but I fear it is inherent in a situation in which German tanks and aeroplanesare on the frontier. Franco, says Colonel Beigbeder, must remember that themonster is on his back. This being so our only course is to rely upon our friendlyactions eventually having the result they deserve, and always to remember thatconstant plots and prejudices have made our road both long and difficult.Let me now summarise in a sentence or two the issues that are at stake andthe action that I recommend.  The issues are three : Firstly, the strengthening of the hands of Colonel Beigbeder and hiscolleagues in the Cabinet who are opposed to the germanophil policy ofSenor Suner.Secondly, a rallying point for the growing body of opinion in Spain that is opposed to German domination. If this body of opinion can be consolidated and increased, any German ultimatum will burst upon a hostile and resentful spain and the events of 1807 and 1808 may be repeated. Out of this situation may eventually develop a triple alliance covering the Iberian Peninsula.Thirdly, Spain can still, in my view, be kept out of the continental bloc. as things are, the Iberian Peninsula is the last corner of continental Europe outsidethe continental bloc. It seems to me vitally important for us to maintain thisindependence if for no other purpose than to keep it as a card of re-entry, military,economic or political, into Europe. Spain, moreover, is looking more and more to the Atlantic and less and less to the Mediterranean. Being on our lines ofcommunication, having an Atlantic rather than a. continental outlook, being atthe same time a jealous rival of Italy and a very suspicious neighbour of Germany.Spain seems to me to offer us to-day chances that do not exist in any other partof the continent. I cannot impress too strongly upon my friends in London theimportance of the issues at stake or the great urgency of reaching decisionsupon them.(Initialled) S. H.Madrid, September 24, 1940.
