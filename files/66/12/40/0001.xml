17r1(THIS DOCUMENT IG THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)setting C R E T/. ^\  , - .,,Copy No.       flMW.P. ;(y) MO.9th October,  19hQ. !ten,WAR    CABINET.THE BLOCKADE AND FRENCH WEST AFRICA.Memorandum by the Minister__of Economic Warfare._I undertook to furnish the Cabinet with some facts regardingtrade to and from Vichy-French West Africa, together with somesuggestions on policy.(&quot;1) Exports from French West Africa to France:.The main items of French West African exports in 1938 .were as follows:Commodities. Metric Tons.Groundnuts unshelled 368,793shelled l69,hOOPalm Kernels 70,786Palm Oil 13,688Cocoa 52,729Bananas 65,128Mahogany UO,533These figures represent a very important trade.    Thequantity of groundnuts is not far short of 50% of the totalEuropean peace consumption; that of palm kernels is over 20% andof cocoa about 20&apos;/o.    These groundnuts, moreover, are nearly50%j of French imports of oilseeds of all kinds.    If France wereto be allowed to import on anything like this scale, it wouldmake a very substantial difference to the European fat situation,and to the economy of the whole enemy and enemy-controlled area.We have received reports that of imports of foodstuffs intoMarseilles the Germans take 60^ and the Italians 20%,.It is also obvious that, if these large quantities ofproduce can be lifted and paid for, considerable distress whichwould otherwise be caused to the producers will be relieved.Unfortunately there is no shipping problem for the French.There are 230,000 tons of shipping in Dakar at present,  including17 Allied ships of 60,000 tons.   At Casablanca there are 7h,000    ,tons,  including 16 Allied ships of U6,000 tons.Groundnuts must soon be moved.    All the warehouses arefull of last year&apos;s crops and this year&apos;s crops are now coming forward.    Unless stored or quickly disposed of, they will go bad.This, therefore,  is the right moment to apply economic pressure,in order to induce a better political state of mind.(2) Exports from France to French West Africa.The principal urgent import needs of French West Africaare as follows on the basis of the imports of 1937:Commodities/
Cotton Tissues 11,000Petroleum Products 70.8,000(including bunkers)Petroleum Products 50,000(excluding bunkers)Coal (including bunkers) 700,000Coal (excluding bunkers) k00,000                       IRice                                                 .131,000Sail cloth, Tarpaulin and sacks 10,000Sugar 2k,000Wheat Flour 19,000Milk 1,000Wine 108,000 hectc-litres.Before the war Prance took 80; i of the exports from this area and supplied Uk% of the imports..   A further substantial part of these imports was supplied from neighbouring british colonies.    We are now exercising a local blockade here, but therelis some smuggling.    Oil is essential to the economic life of the sicolonies since the movement of crops is almost entirely dependent!on road transport.    Other imports,  some in small quantities, arealso vital to the French West African economy and to the prestigeland contentment of the European community.    It is, therefore, mosfdesirable to stop these imports.(3) From the point of view of the Ministry of Economic Vfaffarlthe present position is not only bad, but may&apos; soon worsen.   Ifwe give in to Vichy in permitting coastwise trade along the african coast and through the Straits, and allow ourselves to beintimidated by their third-rate escorts, we shall soon, no doubt,be faced,  on German and Italian orders, with a French demand topermit escorted Trans-Atlantic convoys.    Vichy could send sloopsout to meet these convoys in the Eastern Atlantic and escort their]in.    By this route supplies of oil,  e.g. from Mexico and SouthAmerica, could pour into Dakar and a regular highway be driventhrough our blockade of Europe.    The argument that,  if we refuse the demands of Vichy, Gibraltar will be bombed, would have thesame force then as now.(U) We have already drifted,  though I suspect that many of my colleagues do not fully realise the facts,  into a sort of half-surrender which, unless we now reverse it, will have most, disastrconsequences.    In reply to a signal of enquiry which the Admirsltat my request, made to Gibraltar, the F.O.C.N.A.  reported onOctober 5th that during the period of three weeks 16th september to 5th October no less than 20 vessels were escorted eastwardsthrough the Straits and 3 westwards; also that most of the escorts&apos;were purely symbolic, - sloops, armed trawlers,  survey ships andthe like.    Some of these sloops merely escort one convoy throughthe Straits and then return to pick up another.    This growing gap in our blockade is becoming more and more widely known,  and talk?about, and there can be little doubt that, unless we call a halt-:soon, Germany and Italy will use the French as agents forblockade-breaking on a most formidable scale.(5) Should we continue to tolerate the use by blockade-runners of Vichy-French territorial waters along the African coasiI submit that it is reasonable,  at present, to respect Spanishterritorial waters, but not Vichy-French.    It seems that much ofthis traffic could be intercepted by our patrols operating fromFreetown before it entered Spanish Territorial Waters along the Rio de Oro.    Alternatively,  interception might be made as shipsjemerge at the Northern end of this Spanish corridor.Not/ I
I o JH.D.Ministry of Economic Warfare.9th October,  19u1.Not every blockade-runner need be intercepted.    I donot ask impossibilities of the Admiralty. But I urge strongly that sufficient ships be seized to act as a deterrent.(6) I ask,  therefore,  that the Admiralty should,  as they havealready undertaken to do,  collect sufficient forces to re-establish the blockade against shipping, escorted or not, moving in eitherdirection through the Straits between French West African ports and the Mediterranean.(7)        Making a virtue of necessity,&apos; I am willing that tradeacross the Western Mediterranean, east of the Straits, shouldnot be controlled.    Further, I am willing that ships engaged inapproved barter trade between Casablanca and Cadiz or otherSpanish ports, west of the Straits, should be let through.    Butit would be necessary, to supervise this trade,  to have a british consul re-established at Casablanca.(8)        We warned Vichy via Madrid,  on October 7th,  that &quot;pendingthe issue of the suggested discussions&quot; with them &quot;His Majesty&apos;sGovernment must maintain all their rights cf blockade,  including that of stoppage of trade to and from West Africa ports&apos;5.   Wemust now, I submit, enforce such stoppage.
