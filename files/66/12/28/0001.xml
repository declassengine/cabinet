1 i 6*THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT    ^Printed for the War Cabinet.  October 1940.SECEET. / Copy No. 2?--&quot; 1  /W.P. (30) 398. \JOctober 2, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.GERMAN-ITALIAN-JAPANESE TREATY.MemorandAim by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE, for the information of my colleagues, a memorandum onthe recent pact between Germany, Italy and Japan.EL.Foreign Office, October 2, 1940.SINCE the Cabinet considered the German-Italian-Japanese Treaty on the27th September, I have been giving further consideration to the possible effectsthat this Treaty may have on our position in the Far East.I2. The Germans have no doubt been pressing the Japanese for a long timeto enter into such an alliance, and the Japanese, being cautious people, have probably required a great deal of persuasion. If, therefore, they have now agreedto sign this new treaty, we must suppose that it is because they consider that i;twill strengthen their position and offers them definite advantages.3. But as presented to the world the text of the treaty reads as thoughJapan were alone assuming a real obligation without obtaining any counteradvantage. Japan pledges herself to go to war with us and our Allies in theevent of any country joining in the war on our side. In other words, whatever the circumstances of the moment may be, and whatever Japan&apos;s direct interestsmay dictate, she is bound to go to war with the United States if the UnitedStates attacks Germany or Italy. The precise wording of the treaty is that the signatories &apos;&apos; undertake to assist one another with all political, economic andmilitary means if one of the three contracting parties should be attacked by a power at present not involved in the European War or in the Sino-Japaneseconflict.&quot;4. Against this, the only effective obligation assumed by Germany and Italy is to undertake to go to war with the United States if the latter attacks Japan,and for the rest to recognise the leadership of Japan in the establishment of anew order in Eastern Asia.11175   [21785]
25. I cannot help feeling that this is not the whole story and that Japanmust have obtained some further quid pro quo for the very onerous obligation of going to war with the United States in the circumstances piwided in the treaty.. 6. We know that recently Germany has been making a show of objectingto Japan&apos;s penetration into Indo-China. This may have been part of her politicalgame, since by this means she may hope to give additional value to the concessions which I suspect she has now made to Japan, namely, that Germany and Italywill henceforth and at the Peace Conference recognise Japan&apos;s right to annexall British, French and Netherlands territories in the Far East. This would be giving practical effect to the recognition of Japan&apos;s desire to establish a &quot;new order in Eastern Asia.&quot;7. Another quid pro quo which Japan may have obtained from Hitler isan undertaking by the latter to compel Stalin to disinterest himself in future inthe defence of China, and generally to collaborate with Japan in Asia. Stalin,haunted by the constant nightmare that the major part of the unemployed german army may at any time be moved to his western frontier, is quite capable ofsubmitting to such dictation by Hitler in present circumstances. Moreover, thenew treaty is a definite warning to Stalin that, if he dares to adopt an independentpolicy, he will now be threatened with a war on both fronts. He may well conclude that, this being so, he had much better abandon any ideas he may have beenplaying with of resisting further German penetration in Europe and make thebest terms he can with both Germany and Japan.8.   If, indeed, these are the counter-concessions which Japan has obtainedfrom Germany, the Japanese Government may possibly argue that they had bettercash in on them as quickly as possible before either Hitler or Stalin change their minds and while the United States Government are still more or less paralysedby the impending presidential election.   If so, it is by no means unlikely that japan will take measures in the immediate future to obtain complete control of theDutch East Indies and Indo-China.   Japan may hope that she can attack&apos;these two colonies without running any great risk of the United States coming in1 against her.   Indeed, in the case of the latter colony the process may be said toI have already begun.   Moreover, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that japan may go further and launch a frontal attack against ourselves within thenext month an attack which naturally would be made to synchronise with any german or Italian successes in the Mediterranean and the Near East, whichwould be calculated to paralyse our powers of resistance.9. Quite apart, therefore, from our own measures, we must do whatever ispossible, in conjunction with the United States Government, to show a solid front in the Far East, even though the matter may be, on the Japanese side, as lord Lothian thinks, a huge piece of bluff. For what is most likely to restrain the Japanese from a direct attack upon ourselves is not the measures that we shallbe able to take, but. the risk that by such an attack they would involve themselvesin war with the United States as well. The Japanese decision may thereforelargely depend on how serious the Japanese Government estimate this risk to be. -10. The first reactions in the United States of America appear favourablefrom our point of view, but we must be prepared for the American people torealise now more clearly than hitherto that if they go to war with Germany inour defence they too will have to fight a.war on two fronts. Up till now this danger has been slurred over. Now that it has been forced on public attention bythe new treaty many Americans may feel that, since they are in no positionmaterially to assume such a double undertaking, it will be best for all concerned,including ourselves, that the United States should continue to play the part of abenevolent neutral instead of becoming a harassed belligerent. This development will have to be carefully watched and countered.11. The value of the United States to us at present is as a purveyor ofmunitions and moral support. The Germans realise that as they cannot now hope to deprive us of American moral support, their aim must be to deprive us ofmunitions. They might well think that the most complete way of doing thiswould be to involve the United States in war with Japan; the next best to distract
American attention from Europe. The conclusion of the Three-Power Treatymay go some way to distract American attention from Europe and from Britishneeds for arms, and will also offer a better chance than now exists for involving the United States in war with Japan by encouraging the Japanese hotheads.12. There remains the attitude of the Soviet Government. As my colleagues will have seen, I have instructed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Moscow to sound the Soviet Government on the matter of this new treaty, in the hope that this maythrow further light on the part which Stalin has played in its negotiation, and onthe part he is preparing to play in the manner of its application. If M. Molotovis uncommunicative, we may draw the conclusion that the Soviet Government havesold themselves to Germany in this matter. If, however, he responds toSir S. Cripps&apos; soundings sympathetically, we may be able to follow this up in a manner very much to our advantage more or less on the lines suggested by HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in his telegram No. 795.H.Foreign Office,October 2, 1940.
