This increase is very largely made upof drafts from abroad and earlier recruits whose entry was not made known intime for inclusion in previous reports.2. Morale and discipline. The full effect of the Dakar action has not yetbecome clear. The first result was to cause some depression in the Free french navy.Frenfih Ships taken over by Royal Navy.3.

French Officers and Men awaiting Repatriation in Camps.5. On the 24th September Admiral Muselier visited Liverpool, where the earl of Derby gave a large luncheon party in his honour. The visit was somewhatmarred by the news from Dakar, as a result of which the Admiral decided to visit only one of the camps.6. The rate of recruiting in the camps is now small. Dakar and the resumption of proper naval pay for personnel in camps are probably the chiefreasons for this.7. The news from Dakar had at first a very unsettling effect on the morale of the camps, but this is reported to be wearing off rapidly. The aspect of thematter most disliked is the fighting of Frenchmen against Frenchmen.8. Of the few recruits now coming forward, the best invariably seek to join the Royal Navy. It appears probable that all the recruits worth having in theForces Navales Francaises fibres have now joined that force and futurevolunteers are not likely to be assets.(ii) Army.9.   Camberley.
