The United States Board of inspection has informed theGovernor of Bermuda that the following are their requirements:(1)    A navr-1 air base of about 300 acres for hangars,ramps, shops, stores, quarters for personnel.(2)&apos;   A magazine area of ah out 50 acres, which may bereduced if underground storage can be employed.(3)    Operating facilities for a light naval force,i.e.stores,  oil and repair facilities for about four cruisers,one aircraft carrier,  nine destroyers, six submarines.(4)    Facilities for the army defence of the naval air base,i.e.  anti-aircraft batteries, pursuit planes, heavy guns and supporting infantry, plus an army air field.       The air fieldwould require a runway of 5,000 feet in the direction of the prevailing wind with a runway of 5,500 feet in any direction.The hangars,  shops, stores and quarters for army personnel wouldrequire about 160 acres.(5)   Naval landing field requirements for planes fromcarriers would be met by using the army air field.       The arrayair field and naval air base should be adjoining.2.    The Board of Inspection asked that all these facilities should be centred, in the Great Sound area, and should include manyof the larger islands and an adjoining mainland area of aboutl^r square miles with a wide corridor running right across the mainisland..      The strength of the United States force would, be about ,500 of all ranks,3. These proposals are far in excess of anything previouslycontemplated in Bermuda, and a local Committee, appointed.by theGovernor to represent the interests of the people of Bermuda, is strongly opposed to them and is pressing to be allowed to send adeputation to Washington to state their case.- - Lord Lothianhas asked Mr, Cordell Hull whether he thought it was a good planthat a Bermudian deputation should go to the United States.Mr -
Mr. Full; he says, did not seem enthusiastic about thesuggestion, but&quot; Lord Lothian has no doubt, that they wouldbe received if we asbad the State-Department to receive them.4.      British naval and military officers were instructed by the Governor to investigate whether suitablefacilities could rot be found in the St.George&apos;s Harbour-area at the east end of Bermuda.       Facilities which couldg^be made available there are set out  in Appendix I,astelegraphed by the Governor on the 14th September.5. The Committee on United States Bases have consideredthe views expressed by the Governor and the Local Committee,and make the following observations:-(i) The establishment of the United States baseastride tie main island in the Great Sound,area would interfere very seriously with theeconomic life of Bermuda.       From the .Naval point of view, also,  it would be preferable for the United States base to be established atthe East end of the Colony,(ii) The Admiralty would welcome the establishment ofa land aerodrome in Bermuda, but, for thereasons outlined in (1)  above,  the committee consider that this should be located on LongBird Island.(iii) Owing, to the limited area and density of thepopulation, there are disadvantages in maintainingin normal times a permanent force- of the sizementioned by the United States Board.      It issuggested that,  except in times of tension,  the size of the force should be kept to t^e essential&apos; minimum.(iv) It is important that the planning of the UnitedStates defences should be carefully determined in relation to the existing and proposed Britishde fences,6.      There are certain aspects of this problem affectingthe interests of the inhabitants of Bermuda on which I wishto lay stress.      The United. States proposals are based on theassumption that the United States fleet is preoccupied- in the pacific;,  that the British fleet is no longer operating;thata hostile Power is in command of the  .- Atlantic and. that thescale of attack on Bermuda may.be 10,000 troops in transportssupported by a fleet.        To meet that scale of attack Bermudais to be converted into a first class fortress with a garrison of about 4,500 enlisted. United States personnel in additiorwtoits British garrison and defences.      If these proposals arejjpput into effect,and in -particular if the main base is situ greedin the Great Sound area,  they would cause the gravesteconomic,  social and political dislocation of life in Bermuda.The livelihood of almost the entire population is deriveddirectly or indirectly from the tourist trade and the presenceof wealthy American residents. Thismeans
means of livelihood would disappear except perhaps for acertain number of excursionists.,    The attractions ofBermuda as a resort have heen its beauty, peacefulness,old-world amenities,  facilities for outdoor recreation on land and water in pleasant surroundings,  absence of mechanical  transport and. freedom of movement.    There isalready serious congestion&apos; of population in certain districts and the provision of recreation areas such asplaying-fields and bathing beaches, especially for the poorer classes, is becoming&apos; increasingly difficult,,Presumably, a proportion of the&quot; United States force wouldbe accompanied, by their wives and families,  so thepermensnt addition to the population might be as much as6,000 or 20 per cento    Such a sudden increase - of - population;accompanied, by the eviction from&apos; their homes in the leasedarea of some 1,500 persons, whose re-settlement elsewherewould present a highly difficult problem,  suggests manydangers.to the physical and moral health of the community and the probability of friction and ill-feeling betweenthe inhabitants and the United States force.    But perhaps the gravest danger is that of political dislocation.    Thepeople, of the Colony have always felt a devoted allegiance to the Crown and. a sense of.political dependence on GreatBritain.    It is doubtful whether these feelings,  strong asthey are,.could survive constant evidence of United Statespredominance in the defence of Bermuda and the complete control of the larger area, covered &quot;by the United states proposals.    It should, also be borne in mind that the leaseis  to be a free gift from&apos;the people of Bermuda,  who have for three hundred years enjoyed the control of their internal affairs.7,     The Governor has just forwarded the report of theBermuda Committee setting out their objections to the base-recommended by the United States Board- of Inspection.    Acopy of this report,  the main Substance of which is givenin paragraph 6 above,  is annexed as Appendix II.8.      The:, Committee on United States Bases decided to seek authority in the forthcoming negotiations with theUnited States representatives to place before them the observations made in paragraph 5 with a view to persuadingthem . to agree:(aj    To the United States-main base being located in the it.  George&apos;s harbour area at the East end.of the Colony, and to the provision of onlylimited facilities in the Great Sound.(b;   To the establishment on Long Bird Island of any land aerodrome thought necessary.(c)    That,  except in times of tension,  the size of theforce to be maintained in the Island and thenumber of aircraft should be limited to theessential minimum.(a)
(d;   That the planning of the United Statesdefences should be carefully determined in relatto the existing and proposed. British defences.(e)    To remove any quota restrictions against the entry of Bermudians into the United States.9o      I do not feel, however,  in view of the very strong feeling in Bermuda,  that the proposals of theCommittee,  as set out in paragraph 8 above, are sufficiently definite.    In the case of Bermuda thefacilities to be provided for the United States are a free gift and. in no way conditioned by the Destroyerquestion.    In the circumstances we are,  I submit,  entireljjustified in giving full weight  t-  the views of theBermuda Committee as representing local opinion and inlaying down what it is that we are prepared to offer.Accordingly,  I think it should be made clear:-(aj    that the main base for the United States mustbe located in the St. george harbour area atthe blast end of the Colony:(bj    that an area cannot be provided for a land airfield unless it proves possible to establish the air field on Long Bird Island;(c;    that,  except in times of tension,  the force tobe maintained must be much smaller than has beeisuggested:(d;    that the seaward defences of Bermuda must rernaiin British hands.10.     Finally,  I would urge that a Berrnudian deputattshould, be authorised to go to Washington and state their case against the present United States proposals.    In raakthis recommendation I have in mind, the assurance given bythe Prime Minister in parliament on the 20th August thatthere was no question of any action being taken without tlconsent or against the wishes of the Colonies concerned. Iit is decided, that a Bermudian deputation may go to Washi&quot;the British Ambassador would no doubt (see paragraph 3 ahcbe able to obtain the agreement of the State department tcreceive and. hear the deputation:    its function would, ofcourse, be merely to state Berrnudian objections,  not to conduct negotiations or reach any final settlement.Colonial Office,25th September,  1940.

Subject to paragraph one we wish to record our strong objections as representative Bermudians to the proposals ofthe
the United States Board. In paragraphs 7, 8, and 9 we make special reference to the important question of the location of the base.3.       ^General.    The proposals of the Board in theirmagnitude go far beyond anything that was expected by theHouse of Assembly and the people of Bermuda and would, if adopted,, give rise to the gravest economic, social, andpolitical dislocation of the life of the Colony.    We ask that in considering the detailed representations ?/hichfollow it may be constantly borne in mind that -(a) the area of the Colony is only 19-g- square miles,(b) its present population is 32,000 i.e., more than1600 to the square mile, and(c) the lease will be virtually in perpetuity.4.       Economic dislocation.:   The livelihood of almost the entire population is derived directly or indirectlyfrom the tourist trade and the presence of wealthy Americanresidents.    This means of livelihood would disappearexcept perhaps for a certain number of excursionists,.   the attractions of Bermuda as a resort are its beauty,peacefulness, old-worldliness, facilities for outdoorrecreation on land and water in pleasant surroundings,absence of mechanical transport, freedom of movement etc. eIn all these respects it is clear that the character of theColony would be violently changed by the unsightlybuildings, noise, bustle, restriction of movement in large areas,  and extreme overcrowding which would inevitablyresult from the adoption of the present proposals.    Inaddition the Colony, in spite of its proximity to theUnited States, has so far retained in marked degree Britishcharacteristics plus local characteristics and this has apeculiar attraction for American visitors who find in bermuda their nearest foreign resortc    Those characteristicswould undoubtedly be submerged.    We feel sure that, for theabove mentioned reasons,  the Colony as a pleasure resort ana pleasant place of abode would be ruined.    Desirabletourists would go elsewhere and substantial Americanresidents and many Bermudians ^vould migrate.Among damaging economic results which would foliothe loss of the tourist trade plus the migration ofresidents we mention the following inter-related itemswith the observation that they would have innumerablebye-results and ramifications affecting the whole economic structure of the Colony;(a) Serious general deterioration in value of real property in which there are heavy investments among all classes both directly and by way of mortgage;(b) Loss of business in high grade shops5(o)
(c) Loss of business in high grade hotels , guesthousese i&apos;.c...j .(d) Unemployment oyment;(e) Loss of public revenue from deoreo.es of imports andgeneral decreased tax-paying capacity of population.Apart from the effect of the loss of the tourist trade etc,  itmay be expected that the transference of population an/1consequent creation of new crowded settlements would entailadditional burden on Colonial Treasury in public health andother services incidental to built up areas0In conclusion under this heading we record ourconviction that.the economic gain to be derived from theestablishment of the ba.se as now proposed would, fall far short of the economic damage cansed0   T7e admit that the work of constructing the proposed base would for a time benefit local labour&apos;and certain local interests but its completion would leave us permanently deprived of our amenities and our peacetime source of livelihoods5C        Social-    The density of population of the Colony(1600 to thbb&quot;&quot;ecibbre mile as compared with in the mostpopulated country in Bur troops) has for many years caused, grave concern,,    There is already serious congestion in certain districts and the provision of recreation areas such asplaying fields and bathing beaches especially for the poorerclasses is becoming increasingly difficult&quot;a    The proposals ofthe United States Board, involve the addition of about 4,500adult men and. it may be assumed that some of these would be accompanied by wives and families.    The actual increase in thepermanent population might be as much as 6,000 or about 20 percent of the present population, and the floating population would be increased by the personnel of United States5 war chips&apos;.It is impossible to estimate with any precision the socialeffects of such a large and sudden increase in our alreadyover-dense population, but; it is certain that those effectswould, be disastrous from a social point of view.    The increasein. population accompanied by the removal of persons from their homes in occupied areas and the over-crowding of remainingareas suggest many and varied dangers to physical    and moralhealths    Furthermore the fact that the additional elementwould be largely unmarried service personnel would probablyincrease illegitimacy and miscegenation which are evils in themselves, and would lead to further overpopulation.    Ahigh percentage of local coloured, women hove lax morals evenin prosperous times and illegitimate coloured births newnumber nearly one quarter of total coloured births.      To sumup we might expect to encounter the usual evils of over-population aggravated by the presence of a large foreigngarrison living in a very small area largely among persons of colour and out off by sea from home influences&quot;
6.    Political. The political dislocation may proveeventually to be the most serious of all. The people of theColony have always felt devoted allegiance to the Crown and;sense of political dependence on Great Britain.It seems doubtful whether these feelings strong as they now are could auv&quot;?ive the constant evidence of United Statespredominance ina Iffhs defence of the Colony and complete controof large area which the proposals would entail.      We also feethat political problems would arise in respect of the follow!services:-Ports and Harbours, Lighthouses, Pilot Services and ship Channels, Shipping, Civil Air Service Development,InlandTransportation, Customs, Police, Administration of Justice,Postal, Cable and Wireless and Local Government.7.    Request for Modification of Proposals;    Site of Base.The foregoing observations apply in greater or less degreito the establishment of a base on the scale proposed wherever the base may be situated, and we therefore ask in the firstplace that,  irrespective of the site of the base, the proposal should be drastically modified, and in particular that theproposed land aerodrome which has never been mentioned in previous negotiations should be abandoned.    If however imperisinterests demand that the United States should possess a bassof the magnitude proposed, then it is&apos; d.oubly important to us that the whole of the base should be concentrated at the EastEnd of the Islands.      We note in this connection that lord lothian&apos;s note leaves the exact location of the base  to bedecided by common agreement and we bear in mind the PrimeMinister&apos;s assurance that no action would be taken against thewishes of the people of the&apos; Colonies concerned.8.      Special objections to areas selected by Board..The areas selected by the Board are in the highest degreeopen to all the objections we have cited. These areas oompriabout 1/13th of the total area of the Colony.(a)    The mainland area is situated in the middle of theColony..Its retention is indispensable to the existence of the tourist trade generally and. it includes valuable properties,for which there are no possible  substitutes elsewhere in theColony, belonging to some of our most desirable Americanresidents.It &apos;
It Includes a wide corridor from coast to coastdividing the Colony into two parts, and cutting railway and main road communications,      This feature would give rise todifficult political and administrative problems of every hind.Furthermore approximately 1500 persons sTlould be dis-possessed of their homes and their resettlement elsewhere even under poor conditions would present a highly difficult prcble.au(b) The islands selected by the Board, for storage ofammunition and. explosives are seme of the largest and. mostbeautiful in the Great-Sound.      Some have holiday residencesand all are extensively used for recreation by local inhabitantsas well as visitors.      We presume that not only the islands &apos; ybut the waters in the vicinity would become proh.ibj.ted areas.Furthermore with the coming and going of aircraft, servicemotor craft and possibly warships,  the Great Sound Itself wouldbe entirely transformed,      Its waters provj.de the only area forour sport of yacht racing and. one of our principal areas forpleasure boating of every description,The danger of the storage of explosives jn the locality chosen seems to us to be a further objectionablefeature.      The main channel into Hamilton Harbour passes close to these islands and might well be rendered -useless in theevent of an explosion,9.    Bast. ,and &quot;Preferable as Site of Base,    The location of the base at the Bast end&quot; of&quot;&quot;the* Colony would considerably lessen indegree the objections we have mentioned.       We think that to a material extent the base and its activities could thereby bedetached from the ordinary life of the Colony.      Fewer and less,important amenities would be disturbed, fewer political problems would arise and persons dispossessed would be fewer in.number (about 500)  and generally speaking more willing toaccept monetary compensation.10.    Oj^ncli^lon.    We deeply regret that at this time we should feel compelled to raise certain questions which may at first sight appear unseasonable and even prompted by self interestbut we feel very keenly our responsibility for the futurewelfare of the Colony.      We emphasise&apos;that the Colony will welcome any sacrifice necessary to help in. the successful prosecution of tbo war but we can.net forget that the Americanbase will &quot;be permanent and we feel that without detriment to thefighting strength or other vital needs of the Umpire it may wellbe possible to secure the suggested alterations of the present,highly objectionable proposals,,.       We point otic in conclusion thatthe other colonies concerned in- the scheme of United Statesdefence will be far differently affected by reason of theirmuch greater area, sparsity of population and. the fact thattheir industries are not similarly vulnerable.They may even, in a purely material sense, bebenefitedo
