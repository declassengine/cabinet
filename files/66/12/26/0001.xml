The Admiralty&apos;s attention has been directed to Cabinet paper.P.(iO) 392 in which the Foreign Office views on this subject are putforward.     The Admiralty find themselves in general agreement with theForeign Office, and they consider that our whole policy towards the vichy Government and the French colonial empire should be reviewed in thelight of this memorandum.2. So far as the conduct of the war- is concerned, the important thingis that the Germans or Italians should not have the use of the french colonial ports.    It is immaterial to us strategically whether this is assured by the Vichy Government or by de Gaulle, and in the whole of our policy towardsthe latter, the Admiralty are of opinion that the strategical situation inthe Mediterranean and the demands on our naval forces should be governingconsiderations.3. The policy pursued so far has imposed very considerablecommitments on the Navy, which it has only been possible to meet byweakening our forces in the important theatres of the war, i.e., (l) home waters, (2) Mediterranean, (3) trade protection.4. The Admiralty view with considerable concern a continuation ofa policy that will bring our Navy into conflict with the ships of the vichy Government.    Our naval strength is already inadequate for fightingGermany and Italy, and the Admiralty consider that our policy towards the vichy Government should be largely governed by the need to keep the callsupon our naval forces (other than for operations against Germany arid Italy)down to the nrinimurn.5.     \   In addition, the Admiralty consider that our position at gibraltar should be one of the main factors to be taken into account.    Itwas apparent before the Dakar operations that Gibraltar was very vulnerable to French air action from North Africa and that, if France did take suchaction, it would result in Gibraltar being made untenable for our Fleet.6. If Gibraltar is made untenable, our whole strategical positionin the Western Mediterranean is lost, and not only should we be unable tocarry on operations against Italy in this area, but ouiv control of thebottleneck throiigh which supplies must go to Italy and unoccupied france would be gone.

1.     It is impossible to over-estimate the importance of these factors/    Further, our position in the Eastern Mediterranean wouldalso be seriously prejudiced since the operation of passing convoysthrough, which vve are now considering, would become impracticable if great pressure should develop on Egypt from Libya, it may be a matterof the first urgency to pass important reinforcements through the &apos;Mediterranean&quot;.8,     Unfortunately the opportunity given by Dakar to the french to bomb Gibraltar has demonstrated not merely to ourselves but alsoto them that Gibraltar can easily be made untenable as a Naval Base.While in the past they might have hesitated to bomb Gibraltar onaccount of our contraband control measures, they are now more likely,once having tasted blood, to be prepared to bomb Gibraltar again inthe future.     In fact, we have a clear indication, in a messagepassed indirectly from the French Admiralty through our Naval attache in Madrid, that %hoy definitely contemplate such action if we do not meet their wishes on certain&quot;points.     We have no &quot;effective defence against such attack.9.     If we risk the use of Gibraltar for the sake of stoppingcertain French West African produce passing through the Straits, west and to lose far more than we stand to gain, because once we losecontrol of this bottleneck, not only could French West African producepass through, but our blockade of Italy, and hence Germany, would&apos;becomealmost completely ineffective so fax- as naval measures are concerned.No patrol based, on the Azores, even if we had those islands and we&apos; had the ships with which to form the patrol, could hope to be one quarter as effective as interception at the bottleneck of the gibraltar Straits.10.     There were indications before the Dakar incident that the vichy Government were anxious to&apos;come to a modus vivendiwith us onthe subject of the&quot;French colonies.     The Admiralty view is that theresult of Dakar is to make&apos;it more necessary than &quot;before that*we should arrive at such a modus vivendi, even though it may be more difficult to achieve.11.*   With regard to economic questions, the Admiralty view is.that French North Africa might well be rationed as other neutral countries have&apos;been in the past.     Indeed&quot;the Admiralty considerthat we should, if necessary, as a matter of expediency, go further and allow cei&apos;tain goods into unoccupied France by agreement with theFrench Government, so long as this was done on a strictly rationed basis and it was clear that Germany or Italy were not making any substantialgains thereby.A.V.A.Admiralty, S.W.1. &apos;September 30th, 1940
