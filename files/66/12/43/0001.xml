(40) 820)October 11, 1940TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 58)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 12 noon October 3rd to12 noon October 10th,1940[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Cabinet War Room
NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. Wide-spread gales have interfered with naval operations and may-have been a contributory cause of the reduction in our merchant ship losses.British naval activity has continued in the Eastern Mediterranean.Home Waters.2. Gales in the Channel have reduced enemy activity, and there have been no encounters with their surface forces during the period.HM. Submarine H. 49 on return from patrol reported that.she had attacked a north-bound convoy of six ships off the Texel on the 1st October and possiblytorpedoed one. On the night of the 9th/10th October aircraft of the coastal command obtained hits on 2 destroyers at Brest.3. On the 30th September H.M. Trawler Comet was sunk by a mine40 miles south of the Lizard with the loss of all but two of the crew. On the9th October H.M. Trawler Sea King was sunk by an under-water explosion inGrimsby Road with the loss of all hands. H.M. Ships Hambledon and Locustwere damaged by mines, the former off Dover on the 7th October and the latter inthe Thames Estuary on the 8th October.H.M. Trawler Burke was damaged by a bomb during an air attack on Doveron the 8th October.HM. Submarine Talisman was attacked by aircraft south of the Lizard onthe 3rd October, one officer was wounded.The S.S. Oronsay (20,043 tons), employed as a troop transport, was bombed by aircraft 70 miles N.W. of the Bloody Foreland. She was damaged and suffered a few casualties and was forced to return to harbour.HM. Ships Bath, Brighton, Cameron, Charleston, St. Albans and at . Marys (ex-American destroyers) arrived in Belfast from Canada on the8th October.Norway.4. On the 3rd October Skuas from the Fleet Air Arm attacked and hit a5.000-ton Merchant vessel at Haugesund and a 2,000-ton ship at Bjiorne Fiord.Mediterranean.5. H.M. Ships Orion and Sydney carried out a brief bombardment ofMaltezana in Stampalia Island (Dodecanese) on the night of the 2nd/3rdOctober.On the 3rd October a force of battleships, cruisers and destroyers carriedout a sweep to the West of Crete and returned to Alexandria on the 6th October.No reports of encounters with the enemy have been received.The Mediterranean Fleet sailed from Alexandria on the 8th October, forfurther operations.On the 5th October HM. Trawler Kingston Sapphire was torpedoed by a submarine fifty miles South-West of Cadiz. Twenty-eight survivors were landed at Heulva by a Spanish trawler.West Africa.6. General de Gaulle, with Free French naval units and transports,arrived at Duala on the 7th October. His troops have been disembarked and asmall French force has been sent to Pointe Noir.A reconnaissance of Libreville on the 6th October showed one sloop and onemerchant vessel in the harbour. It was not possible to verify the presence of submarines owing to haze.Anti-Submarine Operations.7. On the 5th October H.M. Submarine Tigris attacked three Italiansubmarines of the Santarosa class (815 tons, completed 1930), entering the Gironde
and sank one of them. On the 6th October the Dutch submarine 0.21 unsuccess-fully attacked U-boats off Kors Fjord (Norway). In addition, two attacks weremade by surface craft in the North Sea and two by aircraft off the north ofIreland, but in none of these was there any visible result. The submarine whichwas sunk by H.M. Ships Havock and Hasty on the 2nd October (paragraph 10,Resume No. 57), was the Berillo (620 tons, built 1936). Six officers and fortyratings were rescued.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.8, During the period, thirteen ships (32,369 tons) have been reported sunk.Of these, four British (18,141 tons), one Dutch (2,202 tons), and two neutral ships (7,465 tons), were sunk by submarine. Four small ships (1,710 tons) weremined, and two British ships (2,851 tons) were sunk by aircraft. In addition,three British ships (14,418 tons), previously reported as damaged, are now knownto be sunk, and three ships (25,418 tons) were destroyed by enemy raiders in theIndian Ocean in September.The reduction in tonnage lost during this week may be partly due to bad weather.Protection of Seaborne Trade.9. During the week 856 ships, including 145 allied and 47 neutrals, havebeen convoyed, and two vessels have been sunk. One anti-aircraft cruiser, oneanti-aircraft ship, twelve armed merchant cruisers, thirty-one destroyers and thirty-nine sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duty.10. Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the 5th October exceeded a million tons, the amount being 1,106,737 tons, corn-pared with 799,188 tons during the previous week, and with. 913,564, the average for the previous ten weeks. Eighteen tankers brought 187,711 tons of oil ofvarious grades. Mineral imports were 416,726 tons, of which 326,580 tons weresteel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore. The corresponding figures for theprevious week were 291,646 tons, of which 212,779 tons were steel and ore, &amp;c.Timber and wood pulp imports were 114,145 tons, and cereals were 167,799 tons,eighteen ships being fully laden with grain and flour.Enemy Intelligence.German.11. There is no indication of change in the disposition of the main Germansurface units during the period under review. It now seems certain that thepersistent stories of cruiser movements in Norwegian waters during Septemberwere not without foundation and that there was a large cruiser in those partson the 28th September.There has been little change in the shipping position in the enemy-occupiedports.For the greater part of the period under review there have been three sub-marines well out in the Atlantic in the region of 200 to 240 West. The onesubmarine in the North-West Approaches has been in the neighbourhood ofRockall. Further south there has been evidence of the movement South-West ofIreland of submarines on passage to and from Lorient. A German submarinewhich has been at work off the Azores now seems to be homeward bound.Italian.12. Final reports of the ships sighted by aircraft in the Ionian Sea on the30th September show them to have been four or five battleships, eleven cruisers and seventeen destroyers. They were steaming northwards towards Taranto.Examination of the photographs taken over Taranto on the 2nd October showtwo Littorio class battleships in the harbour and three Cavour. This confirms the aircraft reports and aiso suggests that only one battleship was seriously damaged during the summer and not two as had been suggested in some accounts.[21814] &quot;l B
In the earlier part of the week two Italian submarines were reported, oneoff Cape Trafalgar and one East of the Azores, and on the 7th October two are known to have entered the Gironde. A report states that arrangements havebeen made to accommodate ten in those ports. Aircraft reconnaissance on the6th October showed one submarine at Massawa.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.13. A report has been received that the Spring fjord (2,027 tons, which wasbuilt for the British Springwell Shipping Company and launched at Trondheimlate in 1939) has been renamed the Rudersheim. She is reported to have leftTrondheim with troops bound North on the 30th September.All the German ore ships with double decks at Lulea on the 30th. Septemberwere ordered to return to Germany at once.The Saarland (6,725 tons) left Dairen on the 2nd October, after the captainand crew had been relieved by Japanese. Two other German ships had previouslyleft that port on the 14th August and were also reported to have had Japanesecrews.The Frankfurt (5,522 tons), at Talcahuano. Chile, has discharged 1,000 tonsof sulphur and nineteen tons of lumber.   In July she loaded 500 tons of coal.The Eisenach (4,423 tons), which is at Punta Arenas, is reported to havefitted scuttling charges in her hold.On the 30th September it was reported that the Arauca (4,354 tons), at PortEverglades, Florida, had been released from her attachment. She has now beenreattached. on account of a claim of 24,000 dollars. Should this claim be paidtwo further claims will be pressed.The banker Germania (9,851 tons), at Ponta Delgada in the Azores, asked the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey to supply sixty tons of oil. The request was refused. The Klaus Schoke (5,836 tons), at Horta, is taking about 100 tonsof coal from another German ship, and is showing signs of sailing.Italian.&apos; 14. It has been reported that two Italian ships were torpedoed off Durazzoon the 30th September. These ships are said to have been the Carmen (1,434 tons),carrying a cargo of cement, and the Rudi, &quot;carrying frozen beef. The latter shiphas not so far been identified.Auxiliary sailing ships of 150-200 tons are said to be carrying food from italy to the Dodecanese Islands, flying Greek or Italian colours as circumstancesrequire.A press report from Mexico states that nine Italian ships in Gulf ports are preparing to go to sea, and that their crews have been ordered to hold themselvesin readiness.The Orata (8,631 tons), at Las Palmas, was discharging her cargo ashore onthe 4th October.British Minelaying.15. There has been no British minelaying in the period under review except by aircraft. This has continued off the Dutch Coast and in the Bay of Biscayarea, and has been extended again to the Baltic.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.Home Waters.16. The limits of the Falmouth minefield, laid during the night of the28th/29th September, have not yet been determined, but the dangerous area hasbeen considerably enlarged as casualties have occurred and mines have been cutoutside the orginally-estimated limits. Twenty-three mines have been cut in thisminefield during the week the 2nd October to the 9th October, seventeen of themin the process of clearing a channel past the Manacles to the Lizard. Theexplosions from the mines were very heavy. A new type of non-explosivesweep-cutter has been recovered during sweeping operations, and has been sent to
H.M.S. Vernon for investigation. It is thought thai delayed release mines andexplosive cutters have also been laid in this held. A further group of Oropesatrawlers have been sent to Falmouth from Portsmouth to strengthen the mine-sweeping forces in the Western Approaches.17. On the 4th October sweepers ahead of a convoy swept and explodedcontact mines at the southern end of the Downs, west of the Goodwin LightVessel. It is presumed that E-Boats had laid a minefield there the previous night.The searched channel was swept without result, and then bad weather held upsweeping operations for over a day. On the 7th October three mines were cut and two exploded in the sweeps, and later that day a dangerous area was declared,as a casualty had occurred which appeared to be due to a delayed release mine.Next day another mine was exploded but again bad weather interruptedoperations. Ships will have to be swept through until the channel can beconsidered thoroughly clear.18. During the week LL Sweeps have exploded one magnetic mine in theTongue area, two in the Barrow Deep and two in the Humber area.The magnetic mine total on the 9th October was 684, the contact mine total was 570, and the &quot; Accoustic &quot; mine total was 22.An RAP. high-speed launch exploded what is thought to have been an&quot;-accoustic &quot; mine inside the Humber on the 7th October, suffering considerable damage. H.M.S. Malcolm exploded one in the Barrow Deep on the 8th October,while proceeding at twenty-five knots : many ships in convoys proceeding atslow speed had previously passed over this mine without detonating it.M mediterranean.19. During the week five contact mines have been swept between the GrandHarbour and the Marsa Scirocco, Malta, and in the declared dangerous area.This dangerous area has now been cancelled.French Colonies.20. French merchant ships from French colonial ports on the Atlantic areat present being convoyed through the Straits of Gibraltar. The escorting shipsthen leave the convoy and return westward, while the convoy continues insideterritorial waters. Ships may perhaps leave territorial waters at some point east-ward of the Straits, but it has been reported that some continue inside to Oranor Algiers, where their cargoes are transhipped for Marseilles. The cargoesfrom Casablanca are said to be mostly maize, barley and skins.U.S.S.R. New Construction.Battleships.21. The hull of one of the battleships building at Leningrad is about one-third completed. The tonnage of these battleships has been stated by theSoviet authorities to be 45,000 tons.Cruisers.22. The hulls of two new cruisers, probably of 7,725 tons, are about 40 percent, completed at Leningrad. Two cruisers of this type are believed to have beenunder construction since the end of 1937, and, having regard to the difficulties that the Russians are known to have had in their cruiser construction, it ispossible that these hulls are the same. On the other hand, as the cruiserMaxim Gorki was completed in three years, it seems reasonable to suppose thatthese cruisers are considerably more than 40 per cent, completed.Work on the ex-German cruiser of the Hipper class has been begun, notablyon the support of No. 2 turret and on midship superstructure, as well as betweendecks. It can be safely assumed that this cruiser has been turned over to theRussians for use in their navy, and that there is no idea of the Baltic ShipbuildingYard being utilised by the Germans as a safe place in which to complete theconstruction of this vessel.
Destroyers.23. The first two vessels of a new series, similar in many respects to the&quot; Gordi &quot; class, but having two funnels and with a different lay-out of armament,are nearly completed.   Their names are Letuchi and Slavni.It is considered that there are fifteen more destroyers either of this improved&quot; Gordi &quot; class or of the new class building in the Soviet naval shipyards, ofwhich at least nine should be in an advanced state of construction.Icebreakers.24. The Molotov, a sister ship of the Stalin, which has been under construc-tion for the last three years, is expected to be completed this year.J apan.25. A review of the Japanese Navy by the Emperor was to be held on the10th October at Yokosuka and fleet exercises on a large scale were expected to begin on the following day. The Combined or Main Fleet and the 4th Fleet aretaking part in the exercises. Units of the 4th Fleet, which were at the PelewIslands, and of the Combined Fleet, which have been reinforcing the China Fleet,returned to Japan early in the month, presumably to take part in this review and exercises.MILITARY SITUATION.Italy and Italian Possessions.26. It is now over three weeks since the Italian forces moved into egytian territory and advanced to Sidi Barrani. Since then there has been no furthereastward movement except for the advance, and subsequent withdrawal, of acolumn of M.T. and tanks which was probably making a reconnaissance in force.Despite continued harassing by our aircraft, there has been considerable M.T.activity in the L. of C. area. The slowness of the advance indicates that marshall Graziani is taking every step to bring up supplies and improve his communications. Further advance by the Italians would involve greater difficulties of supply, particularly of water, and the lengthened lines ofcommunication will become increasingly vulnerable to our air and navalbombardment.27. Concentrations opposite the Sudan and Kenya are still maintained.The Italian forces at Metemma have been recently reinforced.The Balkan States and Turkey.Roumania.28. German troops, which included motorised A.A. artillery units, marchedinto Roumania on the 7th October, but no reliable details of strength oridentifications are yet available. One report puts the total expected at one division, i.e., about 17,000 men.29. Although at present there is no large force of German troops in roumania, it is believed that under one pretext or another Germany will endeavour to increase the number and thus consolidate her hold over the country.The result of such tactics would be that, peacefully, and practically unnoticed,large German forces would eventually occupy Roumania,.Turkey.30. The dispositions of Turkish troops in Thrace are still somewhat obscure,but it appears that the area to the south of the junction of the Bulgarian, greek and Turkish frontiers has been considerably reinforced.Greece.31. While the threat of attack by Italy is regarded as no less imminent, theGreek General Staff are reticent as to the details of any further defensive
preparations. The approach of winter must soon force a decision on Italy,although recent events suggest that an attack on Greece might be part of a largerscheme which would include a southward thrust by Bulgaria, and possibly alsoa south-eastward move by Germany against Turkey. There is as yet no reliableevidence of Bulgarian troop concentrations indicating an imminent offensive.32. The Greek defences against attack both from Albania and from bulgaria are well advanced. Practically no defensive works have been under-taken along the Yugoslav frontier, and an attack through this quarter would takethe country at a serious disadvantage.Gibraltar.33. Arrangements are being made to remove a further 1,600 civilians from gibraltar.   They are being sent direct to the West Indies.Faroes.34. Two further 5 - 5-inch Coast Defence guns are now in position at Naes(Tofte).Middle East.Egypt, Sudan and East Africa.35. There has been no change in the operational situation during the week under review.5th Indian Division are disposed in their battle positions South and west of Kassala.AIR SITUATION.General Review.36. During the week our bombing attacks on enemy targets have been restricted because of unfavourable weather, and on three nights operations had tobe cancelled. There was also a reduction in the scale of enemy operations against this country, probably for the same reason. London was again the chief target of the enemy, while the Liverpool-Manchester area received more attention than any other provincial area.Our operations in the Mediterranean and Middle East have been on the sames cale as those of the last few weeks, and those of the enemy have again beencomparatively light.Operational aircraft battle casualties are recorded in Appendix V, and appendix VI contains further extracts from Raid Assessment Reports.Enemy Territory in Europe.37. Our operations against targets in enemy territory were considerablyhampered during the week by unfavourable weather conditions. Operations on four days of the week were greatly restricted, and on three nights they had to be cancelled owing to very bad weather; Bomber Command flew 121 day and431 night sorties. However, many important targets have been attacked,including oil plants, aluminium works, aircraft factories, marshalling yards and shipping.38. Attacks on shipping in enemy-occupied ports have been continued andwere directed mainly against Calais, Boulogne, Havre and Brest. Particularlyheavy attacks were made against Calais and Boulogne on the night of the7th/8th October, by thirty heavy bombers. Many fires were started and therewere several explosions. The gun emplacements at Cap Gris Nez were attacked on the same night by eight heavy bombers, but results could not be observed.39.   The West, Wilmersdorf and Moabit power stations in Berlin were successfully attacked by thirteen heavy bombers on the night of the 7th/8thOctober, and in each instance large fires were started. Eight other heavy bombers[21814] ^ &apos; c
sattacked military objectives in the centre of the city and a large building was seton fire. The Krupp works at Essen were attacked on three nights of the week,the attack, on the night of the 9th/10th, being particularly heavy and effective.Fires were started, which were burning fiercely when the aircraft left the area.40. The Naval Docks at Wilhelmshaven were attacked twice. On the first occasion fires were caused among buildings, and on the second the Tirpitz was attacked by sixteen heavy bombers. No direct hits were seen, but there were several near misses, one by a 2,000-lb. bomb. A heavy attack was made on theBremen shipyards on the night of the 8th/9th October. All the bombs fell in the target area and there was a direct hit on a row of warehouses.41. The aluminium works at Lunen, Ludwigshaven, Cologne andGrevenbroich, the nickel works at Hanau, near Frankfurt, and the Fokkeraircraft factory at Amsterdam were all successfully attacked, as were several other industrial targets and aerodromes.Great Britain.42. During this period there was a reduction in the scale of operationscarried out by the German Air Force, probably because of adverse weather conditions. On three days of the week there were no attacks by enemy formations,but instead there was a fairly continuous succession of raids by single aircraft.On the days which were fine operations were comparable with those of the pre-ceding week, and on the 5th and 7th October over 500 aircraft operated over thiscountry, fighters providing very large escorts for the long-range bombers. Fighterformations by themselves were also sent on patrols over South-East England, and often covered attacks by small formations and single aircraft. Fighters havealso been used for bombing and their employment in this way may be extended.Enemy formations are showing an increasing disinclination to press home attackswhen intercepted, and the head-on attacks of our fighters are proving particularlyeffective. A heavy attack was made on the Westland aircraft works at Yeovilon the 7th October, but no damage was done.43. By night the scale of attack was maintained at a fairly constant levelof about 200 aircraft, except on the nights of 3rd/4th and 6th/7th October,when it was low owing to bad weather. London was again the chief target, butattacks have continued on the Liverpool-Manchester area and, on a lesser scale,on East Anglia, the Midlands and the South-Eastern counties.44. Several aerodromes and naval air stations were attacked, some by day and some by night. Damage was slight, and is referred to in the Home security situation&apos;45. During the week Fighter Command have flown an average ofapproximately twenty-five sorties each night and a total of 776 patrols, involving3,464 sorties by day.  Details of casualties are given in Appendix V.North Sea and Coastal.46. During the week 268 anti-invasion and anti-submarine patrols andphotographic and offensive reconnaissances, involving 418 sorties, have been flown by Coastal Command, and escorts were provided for 116 convoys.47. On the 5th October an Anson of the Coastal Command directed twominesweepers to the sinking vessel Ottolartd and two boat-loads of the crew wererescued. On the same day three Blenheims attacked a 6,000-ton merchant vesseloff the coast of Norway with bombs and machine-gun fire. One of three Hudsonswhich successfully attacked two armed merchant vessels off Horns Reef on the6th October was itself hit by machine-gun bullets and set on fire; the pilot,however, continued to attack and released a bomb, but the fire spread rapidly and the aircraft dived into the sea. On the night the 9th-10th two destroyers were successfully attacked at Brest as already described.48. On the 7th October a Blenheim on reconnaissance in the english channel encountered three enemy fighters and shot down one of them and onthe following day three Blenheims, while searching for a missing aircraft, shot down two enemy bombers off St. Catherine^ Point.
49. Minelaying by the enemy was curtailed on two nights of the week, whenthe weather was bad. On other nights twenty to thirty aircraft were engaged,mainly in the Thames Estuary, off the East Anglian and North-East Coasts andin Liverpool Bay.Middle East and Mediterranean.Gibraltar.50. On the 7th October a French Glen-Martin attempted a reconnaissanceover Gibraltar, but was driven off by anti-aircraft fire. French aircraft were also reported, on the 2nd and 4th, over Bathurst, Georgetown and Freetown.Malta.51. On the 4th October a formation of about twelve enemy fighters passing-over the Island were attacked by three Blenheims and three Gladiators. one enemy fighter was shot down and another was damaged.Egypt and Libya.52. Our aircraft successfully attacked shipping and stores in TobrukHarbour and the barracks at Bardia on the 4th October. Mechanised transport at Sidi Barrani was attacked on two occasions during the week, and it is believedthat much damage was done. On the 7th October the landing ground at Kufrain the South-East of Libya was bombed and a transport aircraft was destroyed and a bomber damaged. The landing ground at Bardia was attacked on the 8tband thirty-three enemy aircraft were bombed, but results could not be observed.Bombs were also dropped on the barracks at Sollum.53. Two attacks were delivered by the enemy during the week. On the5th October twenty bombers escorted by ten fighters dropped one hundred and sixtybombs oh Mersa Matruh. Some damage was done to the Fleadquarters Fortressand to mechanised vehicles. On the 8th October a few enemy bombers attackedour forward troops near Bugora. No damage was done and one enemy bomberwas shot down by our troops.Sudan, A den and East A frica.54. A number of successful operations were carried out during the week by our aircraft and those of the South African Air Force, from Kenya. On the3rd October Blenheims made several direct hits on the railway station and petroldump at Agordat, and on buildings in the Gallabat Forts on the following day.55. Punitive operations had to be undertaken against the Quteibi tribe inthe Aden Protectorate, and three bombing attacks were made on the Wahididistrict on the 7th and 9th October by fourteen of our bombers, after preliminarywarnings had been given to the inhabitants. Our aircraft also attacked Assabon two occasions, and direct hits were obtained on an ammunition dump, the barracks and the jetties.56. The only enemy attack was made on Dif, 85 miles south-east ofWajir, on the 7th October. No damage was done and there were no casualties.On the 4th October Gladiators of the South African Air Force intercepted three enemy fighters and destroyed one of them.Air Intelligence.Italy.57. One hundred German transport aircraft are reported to be deployed in southern Italy. Whilst these transports may be standing by for a possible move towards Yugoslavia and Greece, it is possible that they may be used fortransporting troops to Eastern Libya, thereby avoiding the sea crossing and con-sequent employment of the Italian fleet for escort purposes.58. It is now known that several buildings of the Caproni workshops at MaiEdaga, a satellite of Gura, were damaged by a Royal Air Force raid on the
30th September. These workshops carry out all major repairs and overhauls onCa. 133 aircraft, and it is possible that&apos;their maintenance will suffer as a resultof this action.Hungary.59. Germany has now refused to supply any further aircraft to Hungary.Spare parts and instruments for German aircraft in the Hungarian Air force are now unobtainable, and efforts are being made to manufacture them locally.Greece.80. It is reported that air patrols of the whole frontier from florina to theTurkish border have been carried out daily since the 3rd October.81. Aircraft of the Italian Air Force now fly on most days right acrossthe Greek mainland from Corfu to the Dodecanese and vice versa.Roumania.82. Naval Attache, Belgrade, reports that air force collaboration between germany and Roumania is centred on the German Air Force being given fullfacilities for the use of Roumanian aerodromes.83. The arrival of two groups of German motorised anti-aircraft artilleryat Ploesti has now been confirmed. Rumours that aircraft of the German AirForce have arrived are not confirmed, and the Roumanian Government have been at particular pains to deny officially that the work being carried out at variousaerodromes is in preparation for the arrival of German units. This denial should,however, be treated with reserve.Turkey.84. It is anticipated that eight all-weather aerodromes will be ready forwinter use before the wet weather puts an end to construction for the year.U.S.A.85. The American Export Airlines have applied to the United StatesGovernment for authority to institute as soon as possible a trans-Atlantic airservice between New York and Rome, via Lisbon and Barcelona.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.86. The force and extent of enemy air activity over this country is summarised under Air Situation.During the period under review there has been a decrease in the enemy&apos;s useof parachute mines, and a considerable increase in the number of cases of machine-gunning of civilians in the street. The latter have not caused seriouscasualties.   Damage and casualties have been less than in previous weeks.Damage.A aerodromes.87. Aerodromes have been attacked for the most part ineffectively. only at Hendon, where a flight of aircraft was destroyed on the night of the 8th/9thOctober, has damage been serious.Aircraft Factories.88. Attacks were made on six aircraft factories, but only minor damage was caused and in no case was production materially affected.Service Establishments.89. Portland Dockyard, Woolwich Arsenal, and the Royal OrdnanceFactories at Pembrey and Chorley were attacked without causing any serious damage.
Electricity, Light and Power.90. Damage to water and other engineering works has immobilised theTower Bridge, which it is expected will be out of action for three or four days.The coal-gas plant at Eochester is out of operation indefinitely, but a full supplyof coal-gas has been obtained from Gillingham and water-gas plant is operating.The pressure over the area of supply of the Gas Light and Coke Company,Limited, in London is now normal except in small isolated areas (reduced pressurehere is due to presence of water in gas mains). The Willesden generating station of the London Power Company received a direct hit, but only a small amount of load was lost (If hours) and production has recommenced.Industry.91. The general industrial damage during the week has been of a relativelyslight character by comparison with previous weeks. The only cases worthy of special mention are : (a) Haughton Butcher and Company, IAmited, W althamstow.Loss of 3-4 days&apos; pi-oduction.Full production; the 7th October, 1940.(b) Siemens Brothers, Limited, Woolwich.Stoppage of assembly and cable manufacture for 2-3 days from the6th October, 1940.(c) L.E.P., Chiswick.Serious  fire during night 8th/9th October  was extinguished onthe 9th October.N.B. These works have been hit on other occasions.(d) Shell Mex and B.P., Limited, Purfleet.12 cisterns damaged (2 lost with 2,000 tons fuel oil, 10 lost only50 per cent, of contents).4 cisterns saved, containing 10,000 tons of gas oil.Railways.92. The railway situation, particularly in London, has improved. an unfortunate hit on the Southern Railway at Charing Cross on the 8th Octoberhas further embarrassed the situation there, and though the District (Under-ground) line was also affected, and the station put temporarily out of commission,the running tracks were restored and trains Dassinff through the same evening.Other Damage.93. Civilian damage has once more been inflicted in almost every district of London. The Tower of London was damaged on the night of the 5th/6th.On the morning of the 8th a stick of bombs dropped between St. James&apos;s Park andCharing Cross, severely damaging the Paymaster-General&apos;s Office and theMinistry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Damage was also caused to theAdmiralty, War Office and Ministry of Transport.94. In the rest of the county the South Coast towns between Worthingand Margate have been attacked persistently every day of the period except the3rd, sometimes suffering two attacks in one day. Manchester and Liverpool havealso suffered damage during the week, mainly to civilian property.95. Among several hospitals which the enemy has hit, the most serious incident was at Shoreditch on the night of the 8th-9th, when, apart fromconsiderable damage to the building, there were heavy casualties.Civilian Casualties.96. The approximate figures for week ending 0600 the 9th October are711 killed and 1,767 wounded. These figures include 549 killed and 1,081 woundedin London.[21814]d
Warnings.97. London has been under warning 26 times by day, for a total period ofover 24 hours; and 10 times by night, for a total period of over 50 hours.Liverpool has had 11 day warnings, and 6 night (totals approximately 6 and10 hours respectively); Bristol has had 9 day warnings (approximately 3 hours)and 8 night (about 12^ hours); and Middlesborough has had 7 night warnings(total about 4^ hours).Disposal of Unexploded Bombs.98. There has been a considerable expansion in the number of bomb-disposalsections and a rise in the rate of disposal of unexploded bombs may be expectedas soon as the training of new personnel is completed. The process of diagnosisof unexploded bombs has improved, as more of the officers of local authoritiesgain experience in recognising them, but the number of so-called unexplodedbombs which the bomb-disposal parties find to have already exploded is still high.The number of unexploded bombs outstanding in the London Region, for instance,on the evening of the 7th October was 966, a reduction of 200 on the corresponding-figure for the 1st October.Civil Defence Operations.99. So far as the London Region is concerned, the Groups into which the region is divided have not been called upon to give mutual assistance to eachother to any great extent except in the matter of rescue parties. Generallyspeaking, the extent of the raiding in each Group has not called for the employ-ment of more &quot;casualty&quot; parties than are available within the Group, thoughthe different local authorities within each Group have often been called upon toassist one another.100. Owing to the fact that a high proportion of the casualties occur inwrecked buildings, the rescue parties have been fully employed, and it has been necessary on a number of occasions to send rescue parties from one Group toanother. The operations of rescue parties on particular sites have often lastedfor several days.Morale.101. The spirit of the public remains good and there is little fresh commentto make on morale during the current week. Deep shelters are more popular,and surface shelters are less so. The numbers of persons resorting to the Tubesis increasing and the measures being taken to improve shelter amenities aregenerally approved.
