rgggSEi OF WHITEHALL.,Report &quot;by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.&apos;./e have considered zhe following proposals made by-the Admiralty for the defence of V/hitehall : -(a). Lewis Guns.    Two Lewis G-uns from those allocated to&apos;.; &quot;blockhouses to he mounted now for A.A. use in the vicinity ofthe: Admiralty &quot;blockhouses.(h) Hotchkiss G-uns0    Two .303 inch Hotchkiss Machine guns to &quot;be mounted now on the roof   of the Admiralty for A.A.use,(c) 2 pdr. Pom poia0 One single barrel 2 pdr. Mk.VIIIpom pom, firing ammunition that destroys itself at 2,500/3,000yards to be mounted on the roof of the Admiralty in the courseof the next few days for A0A. use.     This gun would be. linked up by telephone .to the Military A,A. lines.To be.sure that self-destruction takes place well clearof buildings, arrangements will be made to prevent this gunfiring below 15 0   elevation,2, Oerlikon and - --inch machine guns have been considered,but are deemed to be too destructive of life and property for this duty,.     Pom pom was selected as being noisy and therefore likelyto have best moral effect.3* The guns and gun crews are being made available by theNavy and, under the proposed system of control, will have noadverse effect on the operation of the air defences of London^k*.        &apos;   These defences will give some extra protection toGovernment offices in V/liitehall against low flying attack,particularly in event of the balloon barrage being temporarilyout of action..5* It has occurred to us, however,, that the provision- ofsuch defences for Government offices in Whitehall may reactunfavourably on the morale of other sections of the communitj?&apos;, andon the East End of London in particular.      It is also possible thatdemands for similar defences may be made by Government and otherfactories throughout the&apos; country..    Such demands could not be met from available resources,6.. V/e recommend the installation of these anti-aircraft defences in Y/hitehall on military grounds but suggest that theWar Cabinet should consider the wider issues before the guns are put in position,   .(Signed)  G.L.N.
