(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS-BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken  to ensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.(W.P. (40)414) (Revised).4th November. 1940.WAR    CABINET.GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS PROTECTED ACCOMMODATION.FARADAY BUILDING.Memorandum by the Postmaster General.The Post Office buildings containing the central equipmenton which the Telephone and Telegraph system of the countrydepend and on which the main cable system therefore convergelie in two groups respectively 200 yards North and 200 yardsSouth of St. Pauls Cathedral.The North group comprises the Central Telegraph Office andthe Administrative Buildings.The South group consists of 3 main buildings.1.    Faraday Building North - an old brick construction on  floors neither bomb nor blast proof.2.    Faraday Building South - a modern 7 floor building(communicating with 1).      It has specially strengthenedfloors but does not have a steel frame.These together house the internal and international trunkexchanges, toll A and the automatic equipment for the City aijelCentral Exchanges.3. Faraday Building East, the subject of this minute, is anew 5 storey building adjoining, almost complete, built by &amp;he Office of Works for the Post Office.The Minister of Aircraft production originally proposedthat the whole of this new block (Faraday East) should be surrendered by the Post Office.     He has since modified theseproposals and is now suggesting that two floors of the buildings should be given up and taken for non Post Office purposes.The Post Office objections to this proposal are set out in thefollowing paragraphs:-1,      Sketches showing the allocation of the various floors ineach of the buildings in the Faraday Building group are attached.35     Some 5,000 long distance circuits are routed byunderground cables to this building.      In addition, some,500 Defence circuits pass through apparatus located in thebuilding.* Not copied.COPY NO.        27

There was onedirect hit on the building and there have been a number of near misses.    The one-ton   bomb removed from the roadway at rjt, Paulsmay have been intended for the building.      It fell roughly 130yards from the East Block and 60 yards from the North Block,    a map showing where high explosive bombs are known to have been dropped in the vicinity is attached.      The distances fromFaraday Building have been shown on the map (in yards) and theimpression has been gained that an attack has been directed onthis main communications centre.      It might be advisable to consult the Air Staff on this aspect of the matter.3.      The North Block which houses the Trunk Exchange and the out-going Toll switchboards (Toll fA&apos;) was built 60 or 70 yearsago for the Savings Bank.      In 1906 it was brought into use forthe Trunk Exchange.      It was not designed to house heavy exchangeequipment and had to be strengthened with central steel columnsand beams when the equipment was extended,,      It has no steelframe and serious damage to the walls would result in generalcollapse.     Nevertheless, we are giving service throughout raids on the second and third floors.     The air raid warning system for the Southern half of England is centralised in the switehrcomon the third floor of this building.      The switchboard is mannedcontinuously.     Distribution to the London Region is alsocarried out from this switchroom,4.     The Main Block (South) houses two automatic exchanges andall the engineering apparatus required for trunk purposes.      Inaddition, there is a trunk switchboard on the sixth floor.    Thebuilding has no steel frame although the floors are of reinforcedconcrete suitable for heavy loads up to the sixth floor,    Abo^ethis level it is suitable for light loads and office accorru.i,odationonly, the floors being hollow tiles with reinforcing rods,    the trunk switchroom on the sixth floor has therefore no adequate protection above it and it was proposed to move the switchboardto the East Block so that service could be continued throughoutraids.5.     Because of the risks of severe damage to the North andSouth blocks, the Office of Works was urged to press forward the erection of the East Block despite war conditions.     Theimmediate purpose was to find safe space for a new Toll exchangeto house automatic and manual apparatus in order to avoid the grave risk of a complete breakdown of the Toll system throughbombing;    to house the trunk switchroom referred to inparagraph 4, and to provide on all these a 100 per cent serviceeven during severe raids.     Arrangements have been made to thisend and about 6 to 9 months will be required for completion ofthe work.    In the meantime, temporary provision is being madefor a 50 per cent outgoing toll service, (Toll &apos;A&apos;) from aswitchroom on the first floor of the North&apos;Block by adaptingexisting switchboards.6.      Incoming toll service  (Toll &apos;B&apos;) is obtained via an exchangein Norwich Street, Holborn, but the building is insecure and dangerous and the switchboards cannot be manned during raids0Circuits are being gradually diverted to trunk switchboards inthe North Block but the relief by this means will only be slight.Further, although the North Block is relatively stronger thanthe Norwich Street building, iis by no means a safe building(see paragraph 3),     A reasonably good and secure service cannotbe given unless new switchboards are Installed in the new EastBlock.36 Not copied.

7.     Before the basement of the new East Block had beencompleted, the staff took refuge, during Imminent danger, amongthe racks of apparatus because no refuge space was available.Fortunately, the basement was ready when the intensive bombing of London commenced and the staff could be given a properrefuge.    Roughly, 500 sleep in the basement every night.    Safesleeping accommodation for this highly trained staff isessential.     Not only could they not readily be replaced butshift duties involving sleeping on the premises, areIndispensable   to the maintenance of the service.     The presentdormitory accommodation is congested and inadequate;    the riskof epidemics during the winter is serious.      It was proposed to adapt half of the ground floor of the new East Block to improvethese conditions.8.     There are/o important telephone exchanges In the City areawith some 30,000 to 40,000 lines for which no reserve space was available before the war should any one exchange be knocked out.This factor was also in mind when the Office of Works was pressed to complete the building of the East Block as the upper floorsare quite suitable for this purpose as a temporary measure.Spare automatic and manual equipment is held at various points for replacing any exchange destroyed, but space reasonably near to the damaged or destroyed exchange is essential.9.     To sum up the new Block would givei-(i) means for giving a satisfactory Toll service;(ii) means for improving the Trunk service;(iii) means for improving refuge and dormitory accommodation for staff;(iv) a reserve for Trunk purposes if Faraday North is putout of action;(v) a reserve for a City Automatic Exchange.10.    If two floors of the new Block have to be surrendered, andif it may be assumed that these are the first and second floors,(iv) and (v) above are lost.     If the floors to be surrenderedwere the ground and first it would also be difficult to provide additional dormitory accommodation which would be acceptable to the staff.11.    According to the Office of Works&apos; sketch plans roughly-half the basement would be required for power, ventilating and water plant.      It is doubtful whether this plant could be accomodated on any other floor.      If this should be the casefurther dormitory accommodation would be required to replacethat at present in use in the basement and (ii) the means for improving the Trunk service would then be lost.12.    The loss of a reserve for the trunk system now largelyhoused in the Faraday North Block would be serious.      the underground cables are terminated on frames in this building,the power plant is housed here, and there are some 750 trunkoperating positions together with all the auxiliary desks andequipment necessary to the running of the system.      Thewithdrawal of two floors means that the provision for Trunkpurposes would be restricted to between 200 and 250 operatingpositions, whereas we had expected to instal about 500*     Theservice would therefore be no more than about 25 to 30 per cent,of what is given at present.     It is true that the emergency

O r.arrangements made before the war and extended considerablysince the war began, provided cables in the tube railways andas a ring main round London.      Switchboards were also extendedin existing telephone exchanges to permit a limited service&quot;being continued if Faraday Building were destroyed or seriously damaged,     At the best, however, only from 25 to 30 per cent,of the trunk: and toll services can be given from these exchanges and this would represent limitation of the service to theDefence and other Government Departments, leaving little, ifany, margin for the public.It should be made clear, however, that the centralisedand the dispersed schemes are not complementary.      In practicewe would fall back on one or the other depending on the nature and extent of damage.13.    Regarding the Defence services equipment will be provided in the communications tunnel now being built under Whitehallto give a certain degree of independence to the operationalcircuits for the various Ministries.      The cable system fremthis tunnel passes via the twbe railways to the outskirts ofLondon, but the tubes do not give complete protection as was shown by the damage caused by a bomb at Euston when the tubeswere penetrated and our cables put out of action.      In theultimate the Defence Departments depend on the flexibility ofthe system centred on Faraday Building as a means of making good any loss of circuits.      This happened when the cables atEuston were destroyed and may well happen again.     So far asthe Supply Departments are concerned they of course dependentirely on the trunk and toll systems.14.    As an alternative to the use of the East Block for thespecial purposes in view, the Post Office would suggest anextension of the communications tunnel under Whitehall.      Thebuilding of the tunnel itself will be completed aboutmid-January.      It passes close to Downing Street and a sidetunnel could be driven and rooms built somewhat after the typeof construction used in Underground Stations.      The tunnel islf)0 feet below ground level and access could be constructedfrom some suitable point in Downing StreeC     By increasingthe transport, tool, and labour facilities available to the contractor, and giving priority on material supplies, this work could be started almost at once and could probably becompleted as quickly as the elaborate alterations considered necessary for the further protection of the Faraday East Block.It is therefore a question of weighing the advantages ofthe proposal against the grave disadvantages to the telecommunications of the country.I submit that this proposal should not be proceeded withon the grounds:-1.    That the use to which it is proposed to put FaradayBuilding East could not be kept secret and that an intensification of the bombardment of this important and congested City area must therefore be anticipated,thereby materially increasing the risk to the wholetelecommunications system and at the same time thepossibility of a satisfactory alternative installation.

2.    That an important reserve for the trunk: service wouldhe lost.3.    That the&apos;safe working conditions of the staff inPeraday Building, numbering in all some 2,500, wouldbe worsened, their morale lowered and theiroperational efficiency endangered.(Initialled) W.S.M.General Post Office.4th November, 1940.
