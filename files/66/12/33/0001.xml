S DOCIMMT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S (WvTEFMENT),,SECRET. TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special careW.P.  (40) 403. may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.3RD OCTOBER,  1940. COPY NO.     &amp;f _WAR CABINET. -ADEQUACY OP PROTECTION OF MERCHANT SHIPS IN COIWOY.Memorandum by the First   Lord of the Admiralty.I am sure that War Cabinet appreciate that the anxiety felt bythe Admiralty at the very recent heavy losses of Merchant Shipping is no less than that expressed by the Minister in his paper W. P.(40) 393.2.     The principal cause of the losses by U-boat attack as distinct from those casued by air attack is the lack of escorting vessels.Additional reasons for the increased losses are the employment of newtactics by the U-boats, the use of their new French bases stretching rightdown to the West and enabling them to operate much further westward thanformerly, and also the size of the convoys.3.     The   Minister is   aware that the size of the convoys lias been largely affected by the bunching up of   masses of slow tonnage   to movesupplies from North America before the freeze-up.4.      I   think the reason for   the lack of escorting vessels is alreadyunderstood   by the Cabinet, which has accepted the diversion from tradeprotection duties of   considerable numbers of destroyers and A/S trawlersto anti-invasion duties.      The position has been made even more difficult(i) by the increased demand upon our destroyer forces to give extra and special protection to the convoys which include in-coming munition ships(not one of which has been lost), and (ii) by the need to provide specialescorts for the numerous military convoys until they get past thesubmarine danger zone.5,     The effects of   this x-eduction of escort vessels available for protection of trade   convoys are:-(a) Each individual escort is smaller than the Admiralty consideradequate 0(b) The   distance out into the   Atlantic to which convoys   can beescorted is limited.

(c) The variation of the routes in the   Approaches to thiscountry is restricted owing to the fact that an escort whichleaves an out-going convoy p,m. on one day, has to pick up an in-coming convoy a. m.  the following day,(d) The facilities for training in asdic operation are reduced and without properly trained   operators asdics are not fullyefficient.6.     Within the   total number of escorting vessels available for   allconvoys, both ocean going   and coastal, all possible steps have been takento augment the number available in the North Western Approaches and toincrease their range by the use of Lough Foyle as a refuelling base.7.     The hew enemy tactics seem to indicate   that the U-boats work assurface torpedo-boats,  shadowing the convoy until after dark or locatingit in the dark, and then attacking by   &quot;Browning&quot; from long range andescaping at high speed on the surface.      This makes much more difficult thetask of   the meagre escorting forces with the large convoys; they areseparated from each other by long distances, sometimes so long that the escort is unaware that an attack has taken place.     Every possible step isbeing taken to develop new   methods to counter these new tactics.8.     A reduction in the size of the convoys, which   would be mostwelcome to the Admiralty, could only be achieved at the expense of theimport programme or by increasing the number of convoys.     The latter isclearly impossible without an increase in the number of escorts.      it is thepurpose of this paper to show that immediate assistance in this directioncan only be obtained by the return to trade protection of the forces whichwere   withdrawn for anti-invasion duties.9.       I desire to submit the following views of the Naval Staff uponthe reasons why this   should be authorised at once.10.     After   the collapse of France, when the possible invasion of thiscountry first came under serious consideration,  it was clear that our military and shore defences were   in no condition to resist any enemy troopsthat might reach this   shore.11.     While at our ports abroad a certain standard of preparedness to resist attack has been maintained, the possibility of the invasion of theUnited ........

i u united Kingdom has been so remote for the last hundred years that ithas not been justifiable to incur any considerable expediture on home- defence,,12.      In these circumstances it was clear that only instantreadiness of naval and air   forces at almost every point round our eastand south coasts could prevent enemy landing forces obtaining such a gripthat it would be extremely difficult, with the small military resources at our disposal, to dislodge   them.Our naval forces have,  since that date, been disposed accordinglyand,  in order   to enable this   to be done, it has been necessary towithdraw   forces from the protection of trade to such an extent that the &apos;trade has been most inadequately protected.13.     At the beginning the effect of thir was   not serious as theGerman submarir.es were employed elsewhere, but in the last two monthsthese submarines have been increasingly concentrated against our tradein the   north-western apjjroaches, and the resultant heavy losses givecause for great anxiety.     The Admiralty have explored every method of reducing or mitigating these losses but cannot hold out hope that any measures   will be effective until it is   possible to divert a considerablenumber of anti-submarine vessels, particularly destroyers, from anti-invasionto trade protection duties,lif.      In the meantime the position of this country with regard to its military defences has improved out of all recognition and our shore guns,beach   defences and other military measures are probably now in a bettercondition to deal with an invader than at any previous time in our history.The Admiralty consequently consider that the time has come now to review the necessity for keeping the whole of the naval forces at presentallocated to anti-invasion duties in their present stations.15,      In ports abroad it has always been accepted that a   fleet couldnot be tied to the defence of its bases and in consequence a period hasbeen fixed for each port which has been called the &quot;period before relief&quot;.This period has been calculated on the maximum time which the fleet mightbe ... , ,...

be   expected   to take to reach the port if it wo.ro seriously attacked by sea.     The defences and resources of the pert have in general been developed so as to leave no doubt that it can hold out against any likelyform of attack during this   period before relief.In the   Admiralty view this   same principle of a period beforerelief should now be applied to a considerable part of   the coasts of theUnited Kingdom.     The duration of the period will vary   along the various sections of coast and in accordance with the   scale and importance ofthe attack that might be brought against them.     It Is not suggested thatall naval forces should be removed from our east and south coasts but thatthese forces should   be recuced to the minimum necessary in the   firstinstance and that it should be recognised that it is the responsibilityof the military forces   ashore to hold out for the period until naval forces can come   to their relief.16,      If our proposals are accepted 12 destroyers and 30 A/S Trawlerscould be diverted from anti-invasion work to the protection of trade.In another four or five weeks, 12 destroyers and 6 Corvettes (includingAmerican destroyers then available) should be worked up and join these forces.     Even thc-r.   allowing   for   short repairs and boiler cleaning,the escorts will not reach the full scale considered necessary.      Itwill therefore readily be seen how urgent is the need, for the diversion of the destroyers and trawlers   from anti-invasion duties.     We consider,however, that the temporary weakening of naval anti-invasion forces must be accepted in face of the increasing threat to the &quot;life-line&quot; ofour imports.      Given the capacity of our new shore defences to hold out,the   cutting of the enemy5s communications would be undertaken by reducednaval forces in the   first instance   and re-inforoements withdravm   fromtrade protection which could reach the scene of action in four to five days at bhe most.17.     In conclusion I think it should be pointed out that in spiteof the thinnosri of our escort forces a great many attacks have been madeon U-boats in the last tw months,     After considering the reportswe consider that 7 have been sunk and three others possibly sunk.     In

these circumstances, if we can concentrate the necessary volume of anti-submarine forces in our trade approaches, and also find means of counter-acting the new German method, of long range attack there is good reason tobelieve that the increased menace will be overcome.      It is still necessary, however, for me to emphasise the importance of our mercantileconstruction programme and   the purchase of additional mercantile tonnagefrom abroad,
