&apos;   HOME opinon as SHEWN IN THE MAILS TO U,S.A. AMD EIRE.NO,  11 o //BRITAIN AND THE BLITZKRIEG-.MORALE.The eyes of the country are focussed on London, andthe eyes of London ai^e focussed on itself, to the exclusion of all outLil&amp;e topics.    The impression is given of a oityarising each morning to examine its fresh wounds, and of.a nation holding its &quot;breath, watching &apos;&apos;-o see how that city &apos;will come through its ordealo    In London there is no slightestindication of panic, and the provinces show an awedadmiration, and a rather touching hope that they may conductthemselves as proudly, should the test arise.LONDON,It is impossible to say that the spirit of one part ofthe city is higher than any other, &quot;but the areas which havebeen most severely punished are those which are most insistenton holding out to a finish.    Certain points are emphasized bywriters from all districts and of all classes:Business, as usualc   Writers realize that the Blitzkrieg is expressly designed to dislocate normal life, and are determined to resist this at all costso&quot;Business disrupted, but feel that if we can survive -these bombardments it will adjust itself in a fewweekso&quot;    (W... ,1. )    (l)&quot;introduction afraid the old Tavern has caught a packet andhas spoilt business a bit, but we are stillcarrying on, everyone quite OoK.&quot;    (E. 16*)    (2)&quot;Business as usual during alterations to Europe.&quot;(Northwood, Middlesex)    (3)Work eases Nervous Strain.    Writers are insistent that theymust continue to work, even during raids, otherwise their nerves&quot;all suffer in times    also that their normal amusements mustcontinue0&quot;We discovered this, that while we worked, doing our normal tasks, nervousness, and even the knowledge that a raid was in progress, left us completely,but as soon as we dived into the shelters where we-had nothing to do but play cards.* *. *one*s slightfeeling of nervousness and danger very quicklyreturned^&quot;    (N.W. So)    (4)&quot;I look at it this way.   Hitler is aiming atdemoralising the public, therefore it is mypersonal duty to prevent him from wrecking raynerves,11    (W.C. 1. ) -   (5)

&quot;Some way has got to be thought out of enabling us towork underground as well as. sleep there.&quot;    (&apos;,. .C.1. )    (6)&quot;Of course people don&apos;t like being bombed, but they won*tbe put off going where they want to go and. going to thedogs and the football and the movies.&quot;    (F.4)    (7).Sustained cheerfulness but growing anger.      The good temperand patience of Londoners, especially in the East End, and yettheir rising rage and determination to get their own back,, isspoken of again and again.&quot;As for the Londoners, well, they ere oddly furious, but still able to make jokes and be gay and magnanimous. (Yif,lr.)(8).&quot;Their good humour, their patience their helpfulnessand sustained anger 0v...&quot;    (Cranleigh)    (9)&quot;If Hitler thinks, he can make the people of London panic,wells he has another think coming,      Garry oni     We can take it,&quot;    (S.W.5.)    (10)*&quot;Our foo is pretty desperate .....so therefore he is trying to crush the morale of our people, which he will never do.&quot;(E..1. )    (11)&quot;Wait till the boys of the bulldog breed go to work in a real way.      They&apos;11 be biting chunks out of them Nazies tillthere&apos;s nothing left of &apos;em.     Yes, we&apos;re gonna pulverize&apos;em no criticise  &apos;em.&quot;    (E. ,lv)    (IS)Londoners7 love for their city.&quot;It is enough.to send one crazy to see our lovely citybeing made into a ruin.&quot;    (W.8.)    (13)&quot;As bits of this city we love so much fall in ruins, it ishard not to develop the most unholy hate for the peopleresponsible for&apos; this wanton destruction.&quot;    (N.W.3.)    (14)&quot;I love London but after these days of terriblehappenings, my love has become almost an adoration.&quot;THE PROVINCES,Admiration of London&apos;s stand is a rising chorus, andwriters from other parts of the country take pride in thinking that their own bombardments are nearly as bad.&quot;London 0..c0 these poor people must have come through. Hellalready, but they seem more determined than ever, andthis example must be folloY/ed by all of us.&quot;    (Leeds.) (16)&quot;The Cockneys in our capital are Just marvellous.&quot;(Ellesmcre Port.)&apos;   (17)&quot;As you know, our area is bearing with London the brunt ofthe battle of Britain at the present time, and life is justone excitement after another,,&quot;    (Maidstone.)    (18)&quot;The only thing one could not bear at present would be to live in a safe place a&quot;    (Norwich.)    (19) .

REACTION TO AIR-RAIDS .    ..Morale is highest in London, but the provinces run agood second, and only a few letters from Liverpool, mostlyfrom Irish writers, show any sign of panic..Courage.The almost incredible bravery of the people, theirfortitude and endurance, and in especial the stoic calm ofthose who have lost their homes and possessions, beggarsdescription.    London and the provinces share equal honours in -this last respect,  and all writers are touchingly grateful for the kindness shown to them.&quot;Now the windows are all boarded up and tarpaulin put onthe roof it does not seem so bad ..... The people aroundhere have all been so kind.      So many offered us a home...We did not know we had such wonderful friends.&quot;(Bedford Park, London.)    (20). &quot;I don&apos;t know whether you heard of our bit of bad luck or rather good luck, last Tuesday.     We were left without ahome, but not a scratch to anyone.&quot;    (Liverpool.).   (21)&quot;It is no longe^ necessary to make window displays, thechief reason being that I have no windows.      On the boardswhich have replaced the glass are two notices, which have,caused a deal of comment. -   ^Business as usual, everybodysafe.      Not an ache and only a few panes ...... .&quot;(Liverpool)    (22)&quot;These people who are left without a thing in the world,except the spirit of winning the war ......&quot;    (London, E.8,)(23)&quot;In the East End they seem more annoyed at Buckingham Palcebeing hit than their own homes ..... in some cases had :spread out the Union Jack on the houses that had been hit (Southampton)    (24)The Barrage.Londoners agree universally that the noise of the bigguns is music in their ears, and that they sleep better whenthe barrage is in progress.&quot;The great and lovely guns that burst Hell&apos;s fire into the .Heavens,     What a sighti&quot;    (London)    (25)&quot;The splendid noise of our guns ..... the best tonicLondoners have ever had.&quot;    (N.W.1.)- - (26)&quot;It&apos;s an awful noise, hut it&apos;s.wonderful music all thesame and we like it and are able to get. some sleep while.it&apos;s on.&quot;    (N.15.)    (27)Souvenirs.Londoners have found a new pastime in the collecting -of pieces of shrapnel and fragments of crashed planes.&quot;One of my friends has a piece of wing of an aeroplaneR,,.We all treasure our shrapnel here, for they are goodsouvenirs.&quot;    (E.I..)    (28)Shelters.Letters continue to express confidence in Anderson shelters

and describe personal arrangements for making them more comfortable;but a number of writers are fearful of the cold in the coming winter,without adequate means of heating them.&quot;A pi^operly covered. Anderson is a good protection.      Ours iscosy and comfortable, with a lino on the floor and deckchairs,,,.,,11 (North Shields)      (29)&quot;:/e were nearly 5 hours in last night, and mind, it wasnfthalf cold, Jim. &quot;      (Gateshead)    (30)&quot;It is bad for the old. people and little children.    I donstknow what they will do when the weather gets colder.&quot;(Ashton-under-Lyne). (31)BlackoutsDread of the black-out cortLnues to be voiced in theprovinces,   Londoners, by their lack of comment, seem to have accepted the fact that it is a necessary part of their protection.&quot;V/hen I look out and see the dark, it frightens me worse thanair-raids&quot;.      (Hornaby-on-Tees.)    (32)LACK m,Mim^Reports of lack of sleep come mainly from London, but complaintson this head are almost exclusively from the provinces.&quot;The only thing we grumble at here is trying to get some sleep,which is a bit of a job at times.&quot;    (London, S.B. 14). (33)&quot;It has been something of a revelation to find how little (sleep)you can get along with.&quot;    (London, S.W.1.)    (34)&quot;i/e get very little sleep, my^nerves are bad.    I get so tired,not getting enough sleep.&quot;    (Purbrook).    (35)GERMANY.A wild crescendo of rage and hatred of&apos; all things German isvoiced through the whole Mail.    Letters fall into four categories?those which merely revile the German nation and demand its completeextermination;    those which insist on indiscriminate bombing ofGermany;    those who are happily confident that the invasion will come from our side of the Channel, and a very small proportion amongeducated writers who state that we must never demean ourselves byacting as the Germans are doing.    This point of view is attacked in other letters,&quot;There are talks of reprisals on Berlin, but it is unlike the traditions of our great and mighty Empire, although we shouldbe justified in playing him at his own dastardly game.&quot;(Thurso)    (36)1&quot;Well, when these humanitax-ians wake up with a bomb in the sameroom, maybe they will realize that it doesnst pay to be lenientwith a lot of skrunkso&quot;    (London)    (37)A number of writers state that their extreme hatred of Germanyonly came into full flower since the Blitz started.&quot;There is an intense hatred growing amongst our people againstthe Nazis, and this is something that we have lackedpreviously, for as you know our race are poor1 haters.....&quot;(Manchester)    (38).

A,       167&quot;I personally have only taken this view since I have seen and heard of the sufferings of the poor people.&quot;(Oxford)    (39)But the mass of the people are not concerned with when their hate started;    there is, in fact, a strong indication ofthe &quot;vox populi., vox Deis idea - in other words that, havingborne everything that was required of them with fortitude, and being prepared to continue so to do, they are entitled to demand that reprisals on their enemy shall be taken at the earliestpossible momento&quot;Oh,  to lay a hand on some of those bastards,;i When thisGoddam war&apos;s over it&apos;11 take a hell of a lot of persuading to get us here to treat Nazi Germany withanything but a bloody, cold, implacable hate, for whatthey are trying to do to our city,&quot;(London, Whip    (40)&quot;Nobody seems to mind losing their houses, their money or even their lives, as long as we down thebloody Germans,&quot;      (London, S.W, 1.]    (41)&quot;How a fifteenth rate people like the Germans canimagine that they can beat a people like this seemsso peculiars&quot;      (Beckenham)      (42)&quot;Their anger has turned into a white fury and insteadof being afraid they are straining every nerve.......There will never be peace in the world until &quot;everyHun., man, woman and child,, is sterilized,, *, I should begin with every prisoner we have here,&quot;    (Harpenden)    (43)&quot;So now it is the end of germany,,,o She shall meet amost terrible end,      Germany is the corruption of theworld0&quot;      (Birmingham)      (44)&quot;We should exterminate every man, woman and child inGermany, for they&apos;re all alike,,.oe it&apos;s in theirrotten, bloodo&quot;    (Manchester)    (45)&quot;Murder is in their blood from birth, so there is nothing to do but wipe them all off the earth,&quot;(Ponciau, Wales)    (46)&quot;We are going to lick those damn Huns into a pulp.&quot;(Dundee)    (47)&quot;The shoutingo,,.. when it (a German plane) was brought down,,ooo was like the roar,0.,0 at a big football match.&quot;- (Afflbroath&apos;)     (48)&quot;Tough on the fish who&apos;11 have to share the bottom ofthe sea with Huns,&quot;      (L ndon)    (49)Bombing of Germany,&quot;I..* o,wonder that Britain can treat British life and property as so little value that she won&apos;t do anything to injure or annoy the dear, precious Jerry&apos;s.&quot; (London)    (50)&quot;There is something in the idea of getting bombed thatmakes people want to hit back at the bomber.&quot; (Paisley)    (51)&quot;We should give Berlin the same as what they are makingthe people in London suffer3&quot;    (Caterham)    (52)&quot;If only they would give Germany a taste of what Jerry has given London, people would be more satisfied.     It&apos;s allright taking it on the chin, provided you can get yourtoe under the other fellow,&quot;      (Derby)    (53)&apos; mat  5*&quot;

&quot;What wo should like to hear is that they had bombed Hitloj*,spalace to Hollp and him with it.&quot;-   (Poulton)    (54)&quot;i/hen wo are in a position to bomb at random, I hope we shallforce it home, 0 o a &quot;      (Etching;harn)    (55)Invasion of Geiroajry.fwriters who speak of this, regard it in the main as a necessary step towards shortening the war, as well as much-called-for reprisalo&quot;Personally I hope for a full-scale invasion, as I believewe could in that case..... shorten the war by at least ayeara    Boredom is the greatest trouble - not physical danger,and the more things are kept going the better for us.&quot;-(go rdingb ri dge)    (56)&quot;If we can keep it up a little longer, the invasion willbe from this side of the Channel.&quot;    (Grail, Fife)    (57)&quot;You&apos;11 be having a letter from me with the Berlin postmark yet&quot;.(Stockwell)  (58)THE KING AND QUEEN. &apos;..The bombing of Buckingham Palace has had a very widespreadeffect in the suddenly increased expression of affection for, andappreciation of the King and Queen.    In many letters, apart fromthe very genuine feeling for Their Majesties, there is a distinctimplication that they are as much the property and the pride of thepeople of this country, as, say, St. Paul&apos;s, and that therefore anattempt to injure them is damnable affront.&quot;If only you knew how we all feel about this Palace business.I think if the swines injured either of those two people thewhole nation would march on Germany and tear the people limb .from limb.   3elieve me, these two we have now will be almostworshipped before its finished.&quot;    (Wembley).    (59)&quot;If anything happened, to that grand pair, God help the Gesmans,for the gloves would come off.....&quot;    (Penarth, Glam.)  (60)&quot;They (the workers)  &apos; 11 let no..... -touch their King and Queen&quot;.(Birmingham)    (61).&quot;You will have seen that the Germans tried, to get our King and -dear little Queen.     For this we will never forgive them.&quot;(E. Grinstead)  (62)Appreciation of their Majesties&apos; courage in driving outimmediately after the bombing of the Palace, and of their visits toand sympathy with the people of the Bast End, is warmly stressed,and not by London alone.     The heartening effect of their remaining in London is frequently mentioned, and there is much admiration .&apos;&amp; or the King&apos;s character and the Queen&apos;s beauty and charm.&quot;The King and &apos;4ueen are magnificent, going about among their people and cheering them with their kindness and wonderfulcourage.&apos;&apos;&apos;    (London., W.S.)    (63)&quot;We are all terribly proud of the example of our King and Queen,who, after their home was bombed..... went out alone (theKing driving) in their car to visit the East End.&quot;(Blandford, Dorset)  (64)

She is still in London andgoes out every day amongst the bombs, trying, todo her best, and is giving furniture.......!&apos; -&apos;   (Cholsey, Berks.)    (70)&quot;The Queen is a very beautiful woman.&quot;(Catterick)    (71)The King&apos;s Speech.Appreciation of His Majesty&apos;s speech is widespread.The following is a running commentaryr extracted from manyletters:&quot;I heard our great King1 s speech last night.&quot;   (72)&quot;the finest he has ever made.&quot;    (73)&quot;forgetting nothing and no one.&quot;    (74)&quot;and what courage there was in it and God fearing.&quot;(75)&quot;we were all greatly thrilled by his message*&quot;    (76)INVASION.The general feeling towards the invasion is aptlysummed up by a quotation from Sir Henry Newbolt, given bya Wallasey correspondent:&quot;Gloriana, the Dons may attack us ......They must reach us before they can rack us -And where are the Galleons of Spain?&apos;    (86)

In other words, half the country is.asking itself, &apos;Whydoesn&apos;t he come?5  and the other half is concluding regretfully&apos;He&apos;ll never come now&apos;.     Nevertheless, considerable gustois still shown in planning reprisals to be taken against any German who should dare to set foot on our shores.&quot;The invasion stunt seems to be a flop.&quot;(Dundee)    (87)&quot;We are all on tip-toe waiting to see Jerry chasedout, and beaten.     Hitler so far has not puton his bathing drawers....0&quot;    (Hendon, N.W.4.)  (88)&quot;If we are attacked,  I should just have to sit back and take it, like all the women and children allover Englandc     Still, I&apos;ve got a sword hangingon the wall in my bedroom, so I can have one.glorious swipe before I dieD&quot; (Slough)    (89)&quot;Even if we don&apos;t have guns, we can always use apoker or a pickaxeo&quot;    (Lower Clapton, E.5.)    (90)APPRECIATION OF FIGHTING FORCES.The Air Force is still mentioned, but more as a matterof habit, it would appear,,      &quot;Who could be downhearted with,an air-force like ours?    (Aldgate,, E.C.5J  (91) is a typicalexample;    but admiration, especially from London is centredon the Auxiliary Services,  and most particularly on the.A,F.S.,though the devotion of doctors and nurses in bombed hospitalsis highly praised^&quot;The public services are simply marvellous, within fiveminutes of the falling of the bomb, Fire BrigadeAmbulance, a Clearing Gang and Priest were inatteri danceo&quot;    (London,  S.W.l0)    (92)&quot;The Fire Department is absolutely marvellous.&quot;(London). re..lc )    (93)&quot;No doctor and no nurse have ever left their duty.Many have been killed, but the rest carry on.&quot;( St. Albans, Herts.)    ( 94) .PRIDE OF RACE.An immense and overweening pride in being of Britishstock is voiced throughout the Mail, and many writers seemto feel that their nationality was an asset which they had hitherto failed to appreciate, but which they now acceptwith joy and thanksgiving0&quot;Boy, am I proud   to be British,  and am I glad I cameHome to my own country,  little old England.&quot;(^ol^erhamp^on)    (95)&quot;Don5t I wish I had stayed in the States?., No, Idon&apos;to. co I shouidrrt have had a moment&apos;s peaceo . * o o o . I am very proud of my people, and we are all needed,.....&quot;      (Baling. W. 5.J    (96)

A great number of correspondents seem to find helpin quotations in expressing their feelings in thisconnection.     Rupert Brooke1s &apos;Now God be thanked whohas matched us with His hour1  is naturally a favourite,as is also Shakespeares Henry V - though,  surprisingly,the favourite excerpt from this is a lesser known one:&quot;On, on, ye noblest English, whose blood is fetProm Fathers of war proof......&quot;(Marlow, Bucks)    (97)The most startling emergence is that of ThomasCampbell:&quot;The meteor flag of EnglandShall yet terrific burn;Till danger&apos;s troubled night departAnd the star of peace return.&quot;(Parson&apos;s Green. S.W.6.)    (98)
