THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. COPY NO.W.P. (40)   402.8th October 1940.W AR   CABINET.SUBVERSIVE NEWSPAPER PROPAGANDA.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1.     In the Defence Regulations introduced on the outbreak of war,Regulation 39B made it an offence for any person &quot;to endeavour to influence public opinion in a manner likely to be prejudicial to thedefence of the realm or the efficient prosecution of the war&quot;.     Therewas strong opposition to this Regulation in the House of Commons, andit was amended to read:    &quot;No person shall endeavour by means of anyfalse statement, false document or false report to influence publicopinion in a manner likely to be prejudicial....&quot; etc.     On various occasions the question has arisen whether action should be taken against persons responsible for the publication of newspapers or leafletsunder this Regulation on account of statements which are calculated to give a false view of Government policy and Government schemes.It has, however, been held that prosecutions ought not to be taken under this Regulation in respect of statements which are not merestatements of fact but are in the nature of opinions.     The Regulationwas not aimed at propaganda in the nature of argument but at statementsconveying false information.Undei Defence Regulation 2D, &quot;If the Secretary of State is satisfied that there is in any newspaper a systematic publication ofmatter which is in his opinion calculated to foment opposition to the prosecution to a successful issue of any war in which His Majesty is engaged, he may by Order apply the provisions of this Regulation tothat newspaper&quot;.If the Home Secretary makes an Order applying the provisions ofthis Regulation to any newspaper, it becomes an offence for any person to print, publish or distribute, or to be in any way concerned in the printing, publishing or distribution of such newspapers.Moreover, under Regulation 94B, the Secretary of State may make anOrder directing that the printing press shall not be used until theleave of the High Court has been obtained, and may then under such Orderauthorise the police or other persons to take possession of the printingpress.     No use has hitherto been made of this Regulation.     If action were to be taken under it, it would be necessary for the Secretary ofState first to satisfy himself that there has been in a newspaper a systematic publication of matter such as is described in the Regulation,and then to make an Order applying the provisions of the Regulation tothat newspaper by name.     Such an Order would be served on the Editor orcontrolling Board of the newspaper by the police.     It would then become an offence to publish the newspaper.The Secretary of State could at the same time, if it were thought likely that the Order would be disobeyed, direct the police to takecontrol of the printing presses.

- 2 -There is an alternative procedure under Defence Regulation 2C.Under this Regulation, if it appears to the Secretary of State thatany person is concerned in the systematic publication of matter whichis in the opinion of the Secretary of State calculated to fomentopposition to the prosecution to a successful issue of the war andthat serious mischief may be caused by subsequent publications of asimilar character, the Secretary of State may serve a warning notice on such a person, but in that warning notice he must draw his attentionto the matter objected to.If after such warning that person publishes such matter or aids,abets, or counsels or procures the publication of such matter, then hecan be prosecuted, but the Regulation expressly provides that it shallbe a defence to such a prosecution if the defendant proves he had nointent to foment opposition to the prosecution of the war or had no reasonable cause to believe that the matter published was calculated tofoment such opposition.     Under this Regulation the Home secretary has no power to take summary action for the suppression of a newspaperunless there has first been a warning and after the warning a prosecutionresulting in a conviction.2.     There is in the Daily Mirror and the Sunday Pictorial muchvituperative criticism of members of the Government and much carpingat features of the Government&apos;s policy:   but it is by no means clearthat there is a deliberate intention on the part of those responsiblefor the control of these papers to impede our war effort.     There ismuch in these publications to suggest that they are examples ofirresponsible journalism exploiting all opportunities for scandal-mongering,on much the same line a.s was followed by &quot;John Bull&quot; under the late mr.. Bottomley.     There is much in these papers which Is calculated topromote a war spirit.     They seem to be clearly anxious for the defeat ofHitlerism.     In the Leader in the Daily Mirror of today occurs the sentence:    &quot;Bad as our 1pluto-democratic&apos; world may be, it is at leastbetter than the slavery that would suppress all independent action and thought in the devilish way of life commended by the Nazi fanatics&quot;.Further examples of the kind of propaganda conducted by the Daily Mirrorare given in the appendix to this memorandum.3.     There have been in these papers strong attacks on Ministers and attacks on Generals.     Would, however, the Government be assured ofParliamentary, public and Press support if it appeared to be acting onthe principle that attacks on Ministers and Generals cannot be permitted?Should we not be told that the suppression of such criticism in france was one of the causes of the downfall of France?4.     There is undoubtedly a great difference between constructivecriticism of which the intention is to call attention to errors with aview to securing the better prosecution of the war, and persistentdestructive criticism which is calculated to create a spirit of uneasinessand distrust:    but while it is possible for intelligent readers torecognise the difference between these two kinds of criticism, it is not easy to draft a statutory provision which would apply to the one kind of criticism and not to the other.5.     It is a tradition of the British people that they still remainobedient to the constituted authorities while retaining their liberty toridicule and denounce the individuals who are actually in authority.     Intime of war, and especially in a time of such stress as that which we arenow facing, we have rightly placed limitations on normal liberties, but

0 tJit is a question whether such a degree of danger to the Realm is causedby the Daily Mirror and Sunday Pictorial as to justify so drastic ameasure of interference with the Press as their suppression would involve.-and the Sunday Pictorial6.     If we were to take action against the Daily Mirror/under theexisting Defence Regulation or some revised version of that Regulation,must we not also in that case take similar action against the daily worker, which has sought in every way (without indulging in direct anti-war propaganda) to impede the war effort, for example, by misrepresentingthe Government1s shelter policy, by misrepresenting the scheme for theevacuation of children overseas, by opposing the scheme for &quot;spotters&quot;at factories, by featuring opposition to United States aid to Britain.There are also numerous other publications which have strongly-attacked particular Ministers, and if legal action were taken againstthe Daily Mirror and the Sunday Pictorial it would be difficult to showwhy similar action should not be taken against other papers.     Whilefully realising the possibilities of mischief, and maybe the need for action if the present policy of the Daily Mirror and the Sunday Pictorialcontinues unchecked, I cannot think that there is at this stage a clearcase for action under the Defence Regulations for the suppression of these papers.7.     I submit that in the present circumstances the suggestion of theMinister of Aircraft Production should be adopted and that representationsshould be made to the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association.     I think these representations should be in the nature of a friendly appeal, on the basis that we are confident the Press is anxious to assist in the war effort,and should not be in the nature of a threat.     There is a. risk that any threat of action under the existing Defence Regulation or of theintroduction of any fresh Regulation might suggest to the representativesof the Press that the Government, are contemplating interference with theirlegitimate freedom.8.     Arising particularly from the publication of certain Communistleaflets, my predecessor had given directions for a draft Regulation to beprepared, for the consideration of the Home Policy Committee, amendingRegulation 2D.     The proposal, I understand, is that Regulation 2D shouldbe extended to apply to the systematic publication, not only of matter whichis calculated to foment opposition to the prosecution to a successful issueof the war, but also to matter calculated &quot;to disrupt the unity of effortnecessary to achieve such an issue&quot;.     If such an amendment of Regulation 2Dis approved by Ministers, there should, before such a Regulation is made, beconsultation both with representatives of the Press and with representativeMembers of the House of Commons.     Regulation 2C was settled afterconsultation with representative Members of the House of Commons, and in thecourse of the Debate on Regulation 2D representations were made that this regulation ought not to have been introduced without further consultation.My predecessor explained that Regulation 2D was introduced at a time of acute emergency and he agreed that any further amendment of this Regulationdealing with liberty for the expression of opinion ought to be the subjectof further consultations.H.M.HOME OFFICE..8th October, 1940.

Dakar has claims to rank with the lowest depths ofimbecility to which we have yet sunk.&quot;The leader on September 28th suggested that we werekeeping too- many soldiers in this country.      &quot;The mere threat of invasion has immobilised millions in this country&quot;.The leader on September 30th headed &quot;Play the Man&quot; isan appeal to workers to go on working during air raids.&quot;We appeal to every worker and every employer to play theman .....  stick to your job unless it be foolhardy to do so and be proud that you are taking such a risk lor yourcountry in its finest hour&quot;.The leader on October 1st says,  &quot;when Parliament is allowed to meet again, will LLPs, be able openly to ask afew questions concerning the conduct of the war? ..... are weto waste our fighting strength in futile clashes at remotestrategical points?  ..... will Dakar be the last of thesefumbling fiascos  ..... will our two oddly selected LondonDefence dictators cancel the Committee imbroglio andhasten their job of getting London ready for the long winternight raids  ..... shall we hear less tosh about having already won the war or about winning it in 1950 or later, and get on with the winning of it from day to day&quot;.The leader of October 2nd was about the Spanish positionand spoke of &quot;Franco waiting in Madrid under the blandishmentsof Soapy Sam for the bribes, the promises and the latestdemocratic drive  ..... if Spain comes into the war we shall

deserve every bit of the new nuisance....... we betrayed thosewho had been our friends in the last conflict.      Our dopeGovernment declared it did not want to burn its fingers in spain&quot; .The leader of October 4th headed &quot;Another Sftuffie&quot; says&quot;the appointment of Mr. Ernest Bevin to the War Cabinet maypass......why that inveterate tinker with big problems Sir KingsleyWood should also be appointed to it, nobody outside the innercircle of party politics can explain....      The shifting orshunting of other mediocrities or reputed successes appears tohave been directed by no principle plain to the outsider&quot;.The leader of October 5th headed. &quot;No Brains Trust&apos;&quot; regretsthat there was not a more complete reconstruction of the Governmentand says that if Mr. Churchill succeeds Mr. Chamberlain as leader of the Conservative Party he has &quot;a chance of leading itaway from the follies of its sycopk ntic majority. ... a chance of breaking up the ranks of close-packed Kargessonites who helped tobring it so near disaster&quot;.The leader of October 7bh refers to the Southport Conferenceand says &quot;we hope that the meeting...... will bluntly askMr. Bevin whether official Labour......  is doing enough to secure-that this should be a People&apos;s war&quot;.The leader of October 8th says &quot;In his presidential address to the Trade Unions Conference at Southport Mr. Holmes rightlydrew attention to persistent scandals on the home front.....liecontrasted the fate of the poor people who have lost all theypossess with the attitude of others who will not subscribe toWar Loans because they are not so disposed:    in other words,because the rate of interest is low..... Mr. Holmes might have gone on to paint the picture of our ramshackle civilisation basedon the economic inequality of man, and yet - however bad the&quot;pluto-deinocro. tic&quot; world may be, it. is at least better then thedepravity that would, suppress all independent action and thoughtunder the devilish way of life commended by Nazi fanatics&quot;.For a long time the Daily Mirror has made a special set against Lord Halifax, and on the 4th October on its front pageit has a report that Mr, H.G. Wells said in New York &quot;the man I want to see go is Lord Halifax.        He is the quintessence of allthat patriotic English speaking men should be afraid of&quot;.
