(TIIIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P. (U2J3291ST AUGUST 9 1 91&apos; 2 COPY NO. (V    IWAR Cid3I.NETAIR SERVICE TO THE MIDDLE. east memorandum by the postmaster GeneralTho prospects of this service, as described in thememorandum by the Secretary of State for Air, (W.P. (42)315)make it necessary for mc to draw the attention of my colleagues to tho present position of the Air Mail Service to HisMajesty&apos;s Forces in that theatre of war*As was the case a year ago, the only communications which are transmitted wholly by air arc airgraphs and thinpostcards, both of which have increased by about 150 per centsince January 19h2*      As a result of these increases (whichare no doubt due in part to the despatch of additional british divisions to Eastern theatres) the combined weekly weight forall-air transmission is now about 2.,100 lbs,, and I mustacknowledge the help, hitherto given by the Air Ministry indisposing of this load, which is substantially in excess ofthe allocation of 1,600 lbs0  that the Secretary of State forAir v/as prepared to offer when the number of troops concernedwas considerably smaller (0.Ih (A2)11)*      But I must stress the fact that tho increased use of the airgraph has notlessened the use of the postcard, which retains its popularity,and that no reduction in the capacity required can be looked for in this relation,      I am bound therefore to advise thatthe present limited air capacity available for the troops%mails is a minimum, as things now stand, and that a substantial increase in this minimum is inevitable in the future, ifeven the existing quality of service is to be maintained,,Meanwhile the Commando r-in-*Chief, Middle East, ispressing for the introduction of a standard air letter of light weight in place of the air postcard,- on the grounds that the airgraph and postcard services both lack privacy andthat the present air mail letter service (which-goes by seato West Africa and costs 1s*3d. per half ounce) is too slowand expensive.      I have already considered the possibility ofsuch a change and have secured the agreement of the OverseasMails Committee to it in principle (CM. (h2) 1st Meeting,Item 2),      In my opinion, the needs of the troops will not be reasonably met until a form of communication of this kind which would ensure privacy and at the same time secure speedytransmission is providede.The 6d*  rate whnch has been tentatively suggested for theair letter, and which i0 double the rate for the air postcard,would no doubt result in a substantial proportion of thepresent postcard traffic being diverted to airgraphs, at 3d3

and not to the now air letter service;    but, on the other hand,this service would attract a eroat &amp;eal of traffic from the much dearer and slower air mail letter service at 1s.3d. perhalf ounce via West Africa, and from the surface conveyed&quot;meilwhich, despite a transit time of nearly three months, continuespopular.      With the existing disposition of troops overseas,I cannot estimate a lower weekly capacity than 5,000 lbs.  csrequired for the all-air conveyance of the air letter and theairgraph, and I should, bo glad if the claims of the mailsservice to this allocation may be conceded.      This canecitywould need to be increased as additional British divisions are despatched to Eastern theatres.I have considered the time which would be required forthe introduction of an air letter service and I estimate that about ten weeks would be needed between the date of decisionto introduce such a service and the date when it could be madeavailable to the public.I am bound to point out that,  if the prospects ofincreasing the means of air transport are as slender as thememorandum by the Secretary of State for Air represents, thereis not only no hopo of my being able to meet the wishes of theCommander-in-Chief   Middle East by instituting this now servicebut little prospect of maintaining the existing service ateven a moderate level of efficiency.      Any worsening of thepresent facilities, themselves the object of much criticism,would in my judgment involve grave risk of discontent bothamong the troops and among their friends and relations at home.(Intld. )    W, S.
