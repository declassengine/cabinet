Vice-Admiral E. N. Syfret in H.M.S. Nelson, with H.M. ships Rodney,Victoriozts, Indomitable, Eagle, seven cruisers and 25 destroyers left Gibraltaron the 10th in support of a convoy of 14 vessels with supplies for Malta.H.M. Aircraft-Carrier Furious also sailed with this force, and 36 Spitfires were flown off and arrived at Malta on the 11th. Furious then returned to Gibraltar,and during the passage Wolverine (destroyer) rammed and sank a U-boat.Eagle was torpedoed and sunk by U-boat at 1400/11th when north ofAlgiers.  Sixty-eight officers and 862 ratings were saved.iuuiil *vv iXj. 1$&quot;-On the 12th the convoy was subjected to heavy enemy attack by torpedo bombers, dive bombers, E-boats and U-boats.Indomitable  was  damaged  and  her  speed   reduced.

At 1800/12th an enemy force of four cruisers and six destroyers were reported by aircraft 70 miles north-west of Palermo, steering southward. Twobombing attacks were made by our aircraft on this force and they retired to thenorth-east. The tollowmg day P. 42 (submarine) ^elaimod two hits on an enemy-y8.&quot; cruiser.

On the 12th, aircraft from Malta kept a close watch on the movements of the Italian fleet from Sicilian and Italian harbours. lltf-v-tS^Convoy protection patrols were flown on the 12th and 13th^by Beaufightersand Spitfires from Malta, whilst Sunderlands from Gibraltar provided anti-submarine escorts.Night operations by naval aircraft in Egypt have been on a smaller scale than recently, and were mostly concerned with the bombing of F-boats (tank-landing craft), several of which are believed sunk or damaged, and shipping atMersa Matruh. Enemy landing grounds at Fuka were also attacked with success.One Albacore reported missing.5. During the week 25,029 tons of French shipping eastbound, and13,392 tons westbound have passed Gibraltar under escort.Home Waters.6. During night of 6th/ 7th &quot;two attacks were made on a strongly escortedenemy vessel, which left Boulogne and proceeded into Dunkirk; and anotherattack was made on a small enemy convoy off Cape Barfleur, which was escorted by twelve or more light craft. During these operations enemy- escort vessels were damaged and our casualties were two M.T.B.S sunk and two damaged.On the night of 8th/9th, M.T.B.S attacked two enemy vessels off Calaiswithout result. !A convoy of United States troops arrived in the Clyde on the 7th.
Indian Ocean.7. The Dutch Submarine 0.23 attacked a Japanese convoy of one A.M.C.and four vessels in the Malacca Straits on the 2nd August. Two ships of3-5,000 tons were torpedoed and were last seen heavily on fire.Pacific.8. Operations are being carried out by U.S.A. naval and other forces in the solomon Islands. U.S.A. losses are believed to be at least one cruiser sunk andtwo cruisers, two destroyers and one transport damaged. Australian units arealso taking part (see Military Section).Anti-Submarine Operations.9. In addition to the U-boats rammed by H.M. Destroyers Wolverine andIthuriel during the operations in the Western Mediterranean, three othersuccessful attacks have been reported during the week. H.M. Submarine P. 247torpedoed and sank a U-boat north of the Shetlands on the 3rd, one survivorbeing picked up. H.M. Corvette Dianthus, escorting a homeward bound convoy from Canada, rammed and sank a U-boat in mid-Atlantic on the 8th.H.M. Trawler I slay sank a German U-boat by depth-charges and gunfire off Haifaon the 10th.In addition, fifteen attacks were carried out by U.S.A. forces in the Western.Atlantic, seven by surface craft and eight by aircraft, but no details are known.There have been 25 other attacks : 17 by aircraft, seven by surface craft and one by submarine. In none of these cases was there definite evidence of destruction, although one U-boat is believed to have been seriousty damaged by .S.A. surface craft off Cape Hatteras, and one by aircraft in the western mediterranean. Eight of these attacks were made in the North Atlantic, sixin the Bay of Biscay, five off the U.S.A. eastern seaboard, one in the West Indies,three in the Western Mediterranean and one off Cyprus. Five of the attacks by aircraft, in the North Atlantic, including four by U.S.A. aircraft fromIceland (C), were carried out about 500 miles west of the Hebrides.Enemy Intelligence.German.10. The Pocket Battleship Lutzow has been reported moving south fromTrondheim; and the Cruiser Koln has now left Trondheim. probably for thenorth.More than half Germany&apos;s available tank landing craft are in Scandinavianwaters and the Baltic they are disposed as follows: 30 to 40 in northern norway, 20 in Central Norwegian waters and 50 in the Eastern Baltic.Italian.11. The Italian battleships are concentrated at Taranto. In the last two days the cruisers at Cagliari have moved eastwards and the 8&quot; cruisers fromMessina have also been seen.About 45,000 tons of shipping has arrived in North Africa from Italy duringthe week, mostly at Benghazi; but ships have also reached both Tobruk andTripoli. &quot; vJapanese.12. There is no indication at present that the Japanese have moved any large naval forces to meet the American attacks in the Solomon and AleutianIslands. The apparent reluctance on the part of the enemy to move large forcesout of Home Waters may be on account of the severe loss of aircraft and air personnel in the Midway action, which has made it necessary for the carrierforces to work up a completely new complement of aircraft and aircrews. Thistraining seems to be still in progress, but, as it has been proceeding for nearly two months, the carrier forces should soon be ready for operations.The base for T.B. and escort craft is reported to have been established atEturufuto Island in the Southern Kuriles.[24227]
The Japanese naval force in the New Guinea-Solomons area is estimated tobe three 8&quot; cruisers, three light cruisers, one aircraft-carrier, one seaplane-carrierand about 16 destroyers. There is evidence that at the beginning of Augustconsiderable air reinforcements have been sent to this area by means of a whalefactory ship which was seen on the 3rd August at Rabaul with 21 aircraft on her deck, and a converted aircraft-carrier which was seen off Rabaul on the7th August.It is reported that H.M. destroyer Thraciav, which was abandoned at hong Kong, has been repaired by the Japanese and has sailed from Hong Kong.Raider A ctivity.13. The British Gloucester Castle is now 19 days overdue at Capetown. she would have been in the same area as two ships which were sunk on the 16th and17th July about 850 miles east of Ascension. It is believed that two raidersand a supply ship have.been in that area. The Dalhousie (7,072 tons) was shelledon the 9th August, 900 miles south-west of Ascension by a raider, but no further details have been received.U-boats.14. The general trend of U-boat activity appears to be away from theU.S.A. coasts and West Indies area towards the North-Western Approaches andthe African convoy routes.Japanese U-boats have been active off S.W. Australia and in the TorresStraights, but have not been reported in the Indian Ocean or the MozambiqueChannel.Protection of Seaborne Trade.15. During the week ending 9th/10th August, 1,034 ships, including 275Allied and 24 neutral, have been convoyed. Of these, 283 were in ocean convoys and 751 in British coastal convoys. Two armed merchant cruisers, two anti-aircraft ships, 53 destroyers and 88 sloops, cutters and corvettes were employedon escort duty.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending 8th August totalled 712,000 tons, compared with 731,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 661,000 tons for the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports, 150,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.16. Sixteen ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boats during theweek; of these, 13 are known to be sunk.The homeward-bound convoy from Canada, in which one ship was reportedsunk on the 5th in last week&apos;s Resume, was followed by eight U-boats and attackedagain on the 8th and 10th. Eight more ships were sunk, including theCommodore&apos;s ship, and one was damaged.One tanker was attacked in the Caribbean; two ships, one of which was a tanker, were sunk and two attacked in the Western Atlantic; one ship was sunk off Freetown; and a small ship sunk off Port Moresby in the SW. Pacific area.A coastal convoy was bombed without result off Whitby on the 6th.Attacks on the Malta convoy are reported under Mediterranean section.17. Shipping losses from enemy action during July 1942 as recorded todate total 562,000 gross tons as compai-ed with the monthly totals of 760,000 on june, 708,000 for May, 622,000 for April, and 780,000 for March. The Julytotal would have been even more satisfactory but for the heavy loss sustained ina North Russia convoy amounting to approximately 140,000 tons in the first week of the month.The losses from U-boats show a very distinct improvement, having fallen to 394,000 tons in July from 671,000 in June and 615,000 in May. ,This isprobably due to the extension of the convoy system and other protective measuresto shipping in the Western Atlantic.   That there is a definite downward trend
in the losses due to U-boats is shown by the following figures of such losses on june and July divided into periods of 10 days :-Tons. Tons.l-10th June ...&quot;    249,000 l-10th July ...      150,000ll-20th June ...      208,000        ll-20th Julv        ...      131,00021-30th June ...      214,000        21-31st July ...      113,000As is to be expected, the bulk of the losses have occurred in the Atlantic (see table 2), the losses in the other areas being small in comparison. The rather largefigure under heading &quot; Elsewhere &quot; is accounted for by the inclusion of the heavyNorth Russia convoy loss referred to above.The losses of tankers show a very considerable improvement, the number sunkin May, June and July being 31, 25 and 12 respectively.During July, 547 ships arrived in United Kingdom ports in 20 OceanConvoys without loss. Twenty-three ships were lost in North Russian convoys and 12 ships in other convoys.  Details are given in Appendix I.British Minelaying.18. During the week mines have been laid by surface craft off the east coast, and by submarines in the Bay of Biscay and Mediterranean.Mines have been laid by aircraft, mostly in the Baltic approaches and off theGerman North Sea coast and Bay of Biscay.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.19. There has been very little minelaying by enemy aircraft in the past week, though slight activity was suspected on four nights off the East Coast andThames Estuary and in the Beachy Head area. Eight mines off Beachy Headand 10 mines off the Needles have been destroyed during the week.The mine totals are: acoustic 1,316, magnetic 2,541, moored mines 1,483.The Russian authorities report that a large number of drifting mines,believed to be German, are being found 10 to 30 miles off the Murmansk coast.Thirty-six have been destroyed and two blew up on shore.Enemy Merchant Shipping.20. Photographic reconnaissance on the 3rd August showed three enemymerchantmen at Tobruk.Two Italian tankers sailed from Istanbul on the 6th August and were expected to enter the iEgean early the next morning.vichy Merchant Shipping.21. The Savoie (10,196 tons) and the Jamaique (10,123 tons), which reachedMarseilles on the 20th and 21st July respectively, were inspected by GermanCommissioners on their arrival at Casablanca from Dakar on the 11th July.Under the terms of the Franco-German Armistice Convention, the Germansclaim to control all shipments at this port, but this is the first occasion on whichthey have carried out such an inspection of ships and their crews.Nothing definite has been heard of the Tanker Frimaire (9,242 tons) sinceshe sailed from Aruba^on the 14th June for Covenas, Colombia. Efforts to findher have proved unsuccessful, and it is thought possible that she may have been sunk in the Caribbean.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this Resume)Finland. &apos;. &apos;22 There have been local German attacks in the Murmansk area, but thereare no indications as yet of any large-scale German offensive.[24227] . b 2
Northern and Central Sectors.23. The Russians have continued to attack locally on the front of the RiverVolkhov; south-east of Leningrad, and. in particular, at Rzhev. In both areasthey have met with limited success.Voronezh Sector.24. Fresh Russian attacks have been in part successful, though the Germansstill hold their bridgehead across the Don.Middle Don Sector.25. The Russians have continued to resist in the bend of the Don north-eastand. east of Kletskaya, and to press upon the German flank, though there are indications that their efforts may now be weakening.West of Kalach the Germans, as the result of renewed attacks, have reachedthe line of the river, and it is possible that a considerable Russian force may havebeen cut off.Having so far been thwarted in their efforts to reach Stalingrad from thewest, the Germans, in the course of the week, began to thrust towards the townfrom south of the Don, and advanced a considerable distance beyond Kotelni-kovski. Latterly, however, they have met with increased Russian resistance andhave made little fresh progress.Caucasus.26. The German forces moving southward into the Caucasus have maderapid progress and have operated in three main groups.The most easterly group, having taken Voroshilovsk, has now reached as faras Pyatigorsk, in the Caucasian foothills.The centre group, having crossed the River Kuban from Kropotkin toArmavir, has taken Maikop.The most westerly group has taken Yeisk and has reached the Lower Kubanat Krasnodar.Summary.27. From Leningrad southward to Voronezh the Russians continue toharass the German front at various points. Their successes, however, remain ofa tactical nature only.In the two main fighting areas the sector of the Middle Don and WesternCaucasia the Russians have shown varying degrees of resistance. the approaches to Stalingrad, both from the west and the south-west, they havedefended stubbornly. The retention of Stalingrad, indeed, is essential for thecontinued passage of oil from Baku to the northern Russian armies via the Volga.In western Caucasia, however, Russian resistance has been weak. How far thisis due to designed withdrawal is not known.The Germans appear to have had two immediate objectives in westernCaucasia the capture, now effected, of Maikop, one of the two smaller oilfieldssituated north of the Caucasus range, and the seizure of the naval base ofNovorossisk and of the neighbouring. Caucasian ports. The fall of Novorossiskwould further jeopardise the position of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a positionearlier impaired by the German capture of Sevastopol.There is still no evidence to show how far a third major objective, thedestruction of the Russian armies, has been achieved. Save for the encirclementof Russian forces of unknown size in the Don bend, the Germans have made noclaims to have annihilated or captured large numbers of Russians. The speed of the German advance into western Caucasia, however, suggests somedisorganisation of the Russian forces.Egypt.28.   There has been little activity during the week. A small detachment ofour forces re-occupied positions on Tel El Makhkhad. Otherwise there is nochange in the tactical situation. &apos;.
Far East.Andaman Islands.29. The Japanese are developing landing fields in the Andamans and coastalguns have been reported there.Timor.30. Japanese operations against the Allied guerrillas appear to have startedabout 10th August.New Guinea.31. Patrol activity continues in the Kokoda area (Papua). Kokoda aero-drome was recaptured by our forces on the 9th.A australia.32. HQ., 6th Australian Division, and the 16th and 17th AustralianInfantry Brigades have arrived in Australia from Ceylon.Solomon Islands.33. As from 1st August the South-East Solomon Islands were transferred from South-West Pacific Command to South Pacific Command.U.S.A. forces, under Vice-Admiral Ghormley, attacked the Japanese atTulagi on the 6th. After five days&apos; fighting they have accomplished their plannedlandings, and have beaten off vigorous Japanese counter-attacks.About 1,600 Japanese were believed to be in the Tulagi area, and a further3,000-^,000 in Guadalcanal Island, which lies 40 miles south of Tulagi. TheJapanese hold various strategic points in this area, the most important beingTulagi harbour area, and the plains around Lunga Point in Guadalcanal, where two or three airfields were being hastily built. Altogether, the Japanese are believed to have two divisions and a number of marine landing parties in this area, and they can be reinforced by ooa at chort notice from their divining jnthe Carolines and Philippines.Intelligence.Location of German Divisions.34. Two motorised S.S. divisions have recently arrived in France. One ofthese is the S.S. Division Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler, and the other possiblyS.S. Division Reich. The estimated number of German divisions in France isnow 28, of which three are Panzer and two are motorised divisions; the numberof divisions in the Low Countries remains unchanged at three.It is now believed that the ten divisions in Finland (including the Kirkenesarea of Norway) include another S.S. division in addition to the S.S. MountainDivision Nord, previously identified. This second S.S. division may also be amountain division.AIR SITUATION.General Review.34a. Our night-bombing offensive was directed against Mainz, Osnabruckand Duisburg, the first of two attacks on Mainz being notably effective.Aircraft from Malta supported the incoming convoy operation.Enemy aerodromes in New Guinea and New Britain were repeatedly bombedduring the operations by U.S.A. forces in the Solomons. Successful attacks on shipping were carried out in the Pacific.United Kingdom.35. Fighter Command flew 693 defensive sorties by day and 598 by night.&apos;These included 14 sorties by aircraft of the U.S. Army Air Corps.Fifty-one enemy aircraft flew overland by day compared with 70 last week.The large majority of these were fighters operating along the South and
South-East coasts, and the only penetrations in depth were over Cornwall,Wiltshire, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. One aircraft flew overNorthumberland.By night, about 130 aircraft, which is the same total as in the previousweek, operated against this country. There was no concentrated bombing, butincidents occurred over a very wide area, including Aberdeen, the Firth of Forth,Merseyside, the Midlands and most of the Eastern and South-Eastern counties of England.Seven enemy aircraft were destroyed (including one by A.A. guns), two were probably destroyed and five wei&apos;e damaged.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.36. Fighter and Bomber Commands despatched 503 and 35 offensive sorties respectively, compared with 1,392 and 74 last week.Military targets in occupied territory were attacked by Mustangs of army co-operation Command and by Spitfires. Nine offensive sweeps were flown, andthese included 37 aircraft sorties by Spitfires of the United States Army AirCorps.  The sweeps were uneventful.Night. &apos;37. Bomber Command made 779 aircraft sorties against land targets,compared with 719 last week. Approximately 1,624 tons of bombs were releasedduring the week, including 181 x 4.000-lb. high explosives. Industrial areas inMainz, Osnabruck and Duisburg were the principal objectives. Mainz, animportant railway junction and centre of engineering and chemical works, hadnot previously been attacked in force.Mainz, attacked on two successive nights by a total of 222 aircraft, received318 tons of H.E. bombs and 218 tons of incendiaries. Both raids were successful,particularly the first, during which visibility was better than has been experienced for some weeks. Fires were well concentrated in the town and were still burning next morning. Further extensive fires were started on the secondnight, when our aircraft found low cloud over the area and a number ofthem bombed from 4,500 feet. Nineteen bombers are missing and four crashedin this country.The attack on Osnabruck developed well. Many fires were seen through apall of smoke which covered the target area. About 310 tons of H.E. bombs and149 tons of incendiaries were dropped and bursts were reported on the railway centre and in the Old Town. Of the 192 aircraft despatched, 90 per cent,attacked their target; six are missing.A total of 117 aircraft dropped 239 tons of H.E. bombs and 176 tons ofincendiaries at Duisburg. This attack was marred by bad visibility. Duringintermittent breaks in the cloud, several large fires were seen hear the centre ofthe town and there were scattered fires on the outskirts. Five bombers did not return.Sixty tons of bombs were dropped during two attacks on the dockyards atHavre. Offensive sorties against enemy aerodromes were flown on three nightsby a total of 30 Blenheims. &quot; Intruder &quot; operations by Fighter Commandinvolved 33 sorties.Coastal Operations.38.   Coastal Command flew 517 sorties, of which 19 were on convoy escort,    jLancasters of Bomber Command flew eight escort patrols and fourteen anti-submarine patrols in the Bay of Biscay.  Shipping protection patrols by fighter command totalled 755 sorties.A total of 86 aircraft of Bomber Command laid 218 sea-mines in enemy waters. Seventeen naval Swordfish also laid sea-mines. Four aircraft are missing.. Photographic reconnaissances totalling 78 sorties were flown, including 40by aircraft of Army Co-operation Command.A number of anti-shipping sorties were despatched, but there are no reportsof sinkings. .
Mediterranean.Egypt and Libya.39. In the week ending the 10th August, our aircraft flew 1,719 sortiescompared with 1,611 in the previous week.With the continued lull in ground operations, our fighters and fighter bombers found few suitable targets in the battle area. Two small concentrations of M.T. were attacked, and in the small number of combats which took place,two enemy fighters were destroyed and eight were damaged. Hurricane bombers attacked an enemy camp in the coastal sector and a suspected headquarters but no definite results were observed.Daylight attacks by medium and heavy bombers were made on shipping atTobruk, Benghazi and Mersa Matruh. At Tobruk a 10,000-ton ship was hit and set on fire, and at Benghazi one ship was hit and three others may have been damaged by near misses. Other medium bombers, with fighter escort, attackedlanding grounds near El Daba.By night the principal target was Tobruk, where shipping and harbourinstallations were attacked on each night of the week by a total of about270 Wellingtons, 20 Halifaxes and 4 Liberators. Weather conditions generallywere not favourable, and low cloud consistently hampered the observation of results.  Three ships wrere probably hit and several near misses are reported.Thirty aircraft, including seven naval Albacores, successfully attacked twolanding grounds near El Daba, where numerous fires were started and aircraft on the ground were damaged.Sea mines were laid in Mersa Matruh harbour and off Tobruk and Sollum.Enemy offensive activity was confined to three small attacks on the&apos; Burg elArab area. A fire was started at the railway station and one aircraft on theground was damaged.Spitfires intercepted and damaged three Ju. 88s on reconnaissance over theDelta area.From the above operations, we lost nine bombers and seven fighters, of whichfour bomber crews and one fighter pilot are safe.40. /^About 230 enemy aircraft operated against the island, of which approxi-mately 1 80 turn ed back without crossing the coast. Apart from the destructionof some buildings near Luqa, the only damage inflicted was at Takali aerodrome,where an ambulance was destroyed and seven aircraft on the ground were damaged.Eight Me. 109s and one He. Ill were destroyed by fighters. One Beaufighter,from which the crew was rescued, and &quot;three Spitfires were lost.Operations in connexion ivith the Malta Convoy.41. Eleven Beaufighters operating from Malta carried out a successful dayattack on the aerodromes at Elmas and Decimomannu in Sardinia. One hangar(at Elmas) and seven large aircraft were set on fire, and several other aircraft were seriously damaged. Decimomannu aerodrome was also attacked at night by liberators, which were assisted by two flare-carrying Wellingtons..Bombers operating from Egypt attacked Navarino harbour in Greece. hits were made on two cruisers, and another was probably damaged by a near miss.Beaufighters made a low-level attack on the aerodrome at Pantellaria, whereseveral fires were started.Two enemy cruisers and two destroyers were attacked with bombs on the night of the llth/T2th in the Gulf of Taranto by three Wellingtons. One cruiserwas straddled.Our aircraft made reconnaissance of the movements of Italian naval units,and fighters were despatched to patrol over our ships on the approach of the convoy to Malta.Sea Communication.42. Several attacks, mostly by Hudsons, were made on F-boats, lighters andbarges off the coasts of Egypt and Cyrenaica. Two F-boats and a lighter were destroyed, and a further two F-boats, two lighters and a barge were damaged.Malta
Russia.43. Enemy operations in Southern Russia during the past week were mainly in support of the attack towards Stalingrad and the Volga.The rapid advance of the German army towards Krasnodar and across theKuban river to Maikop has apparently continued to receive only light air support,but bombing raids have taken place against Tuapse and other Black Sea ports.There has been increased air activity on the Central and Leningrad frontsas a result of a Russian offensive in the Rzhev area and south of Leningrad, andconsequently the G.A.F. in Russia is now fully engaged for the first time on allsectors of the main front since the beginning of the summer offensive.There is still no indication of any activity in North Norway and Finland.Pacific Zone.44. Before and during the landings by United States forces in the Solomons,daily attacks by Allied bombers were made against Lae and Salamua aerodromes(New Guinea) and Lukunai, Gasmata and Vunakanau aerodromes (New Britain).Numerous hits on runways and fires among buildings were claimed. the aerodrome at Buka (Solomons) was also bombed. On two occasions, formationsof 20 Japanese fighters which intercepted our bombers suffered severe losses;seven fighters were destroyed on the first occasion and five on the second. OffPapua, Kittyhawks intercepted seven enemy fighters, destroying two and probablydestroying three others.Enemy shipping off Timor was successfully attacked. Hits were made on three ships, of 5,000. 2,000 and 800 tons; two were left burning and onthe following day a sunken 2,000-ton vessel was seen in the vicinity. these attacks were carried out by Hudsons, which also reported two hits on a destroyerin the same area. A Fortress claims to have hit a vessel at Rabaul (New Britain).On the 12th, eight bombers registered hits on four vessels (including one of12.000 tons) in the same harbour; these ships were seen to be on fire and listing.One enemy fighter was destroyed, one probably destroyed and two were damaged.No casualties to our aircraft have been reported.On the 2nd., 3rd and 5th. enemy attacks were made on Ocean Island. the wireless station at Nauru was ineffectively bombed and machine-gunned. Other-wise, there are no reports of offensive activity by the Japanese air force.India and Burma.45. Our aircraft have recently co-operated in the operations conducted by our land forces against rebel bands in the Miranshah district (North - west frontier). During the ten days ending 5th August, Blenheims, Audax andLysanders flew 113 offensive sorties and a number of targets were bombedeffectively; our casualties were one aircraft crashed and, another forced-landed,the crew of the latter being killed by hostile tribesmen.In North-West Burma we have continued to harass the enemy with smallattacks on targets in the Kawngkan and Kalewa areas. A bridge was demolishedbetween Taungni and Pindaw (S.W. of Mogaung).China.46.   On the 3rd, aircraft of the U.S.A. Army Air Corps bombed Linchwan(Canton).Three days later, Tien Ho aerodrome (Canton) was raided and at least ten   1Japanese aircraft were destroyed on the ground.   On the 8th, several more were destroyed on White Cloud aerodrome (Canton) and. severe damage inflictedelsewhere in the area.  All Allied aircraft returned safely from these operations;one enemy fighter was destroyed and one probably destroyed.On the 5th 42 Japanese fighters, which attacked Hengyang aerodrome(Hunan), were intercepted by eight P. 40&apos;s; two of the&apos;enemy aircraft were shot down and a third was destroyed by A.A. gunfire; two P. 40&apos;s are missing(one pilot safe). -
