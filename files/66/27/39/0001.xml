Mining19/2020/2123/2425/26July1911128The number of mines laid (all during the week ending the 26th July) was 142,of which 57 were off the West Coast of France and 85 off the Dutch Coast and the frisian Islands.  A total of 900 mines was laid during July.Operational Achievements.Duisburg (July 21/22, 23/24, 25/26).. 4: - The main effort of the week ending the 26th July was on Duisburg, whichwas attacked on three occasions, by a total of 819 aircraft. The second attack,owing to cloud conditions, was successfully achieved using the blind bombingtechnique. It was not until the 31st July that damage assessment photographscould be obtained. At the time of writing a full interpretation has not beencompleted, but the indications are that the degree of concentrated destructionachieved may exceed any yet obtained in the Ruhr.The photographs show that the damage, spread over the. districts ofMeiderich, Laar, Beeck and Ruhrort and extending as far as Hamborn in theN. and Homberg in the W., is most concentrated in the central districts ofPapendell and Hochfeld. Warehouses on the quayside of the Inner Harbour andothers on the quay of the Railway Dock at Laar have been destroyed.Damage has occurred&quot; mainly to business and residential property, but theMain Railway Station and the Tram Depot have been hit, as well as one or twoshops in the Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G. at Laar and the Deutsche Maschinen-fabrik A.G. at Hochfeld. The Thyssen works at Hamborn have again been damaged, and the pithead buildings of a coal mine at Neuenkamp have been demolished.Hamburg.   (26th/27th July.   28th/29th July.)5. The raid on the 26th/27th July was made by the largest force that has yet attacked this city.Visibility was excellent and the number and accuracy of night photos showed that most crews found their targets. Daylight photos taken on the 27th Julycovered most of the city and suburbs, but some built-up areas which we know from night photos were severely hit have not yet been reconnoitred.Most of the visible damage has been caused by fire and is concentrated round the two aiming points, which were in the old part of the city and in an areaimmediately east of it. The greatest destruction is among the business premises and public buildings near the city centre and comprises Hamburg&apos;s mainshopping district; 15 blocks covering an area of 12 acres are seen from photos tohave been largely gutted by fire and, to be still burning on the following day.Outside the old town many hundreds of houses in built-up residential areas and many warehouses, factory buildings and storage sheds were destroyed.A follow-up attack in greater strength was planned for the riext night(28th/29th July) but weather deteriorated to such an extent that it was necessary
to cancel all except one Group. 177 aircraft set out, and after experiencing severe weather conditions en route, found Hamburg completely covered by cloud at13,000 feet. Many crews bombed from beneath the clouds and were able to&apos; identify the city. In spite of the weather it is believed that the raid was successful and that extensive fires were caused. The results of this raid have notyet been covered by day reconnaissance, but the German High Commandcommunique&apos; of the 29th July stated that many public buildings and residentialquarters in Hamburg had been hit and that the civilian population had sufferedcasualties.Hamburg is the Reich&apos;s second, largest city, and its morale must have been severely shaken after three raid-free months. The casualties, loss of livingquarters and disruption of business and public services which it has now sustainedmust seriously affect the production from its great industries.Saarbrucken.   (29th/30th July.)6. 291 aircraft attacked this highly industrialised area. Weather was good on the whole and. there were large gaps in the cloud with good visibilitybelow.  There was excellent moonlight, and the town was accurately identified.A preliminary assessment of the photographs shows large areas of destructionby fire and blast in the industrial and residential areas, particularly on the Northbank of the River Saar. Many houses in the district of Halstatt, Burbach and at . Johann, and others on the South side of the river have been destroyed. Thereis considerable damage to workshops. Approximately one quarter of a largeengineering works near the railway junction north of the town has been completely -destroyed by fire and blast. About half the buildings of the main goods stationhave been destroyed by high explosive. There is also severe damage to several large sheds north of the main railway station. On the north side of the town aconsiderable part of a housing estate has been gutted by fire. There is anotherlarge area of fire damage immediately south of the main railway station. Inaddition, there are many isolated areas of destruction caused by the blast of4,000-lb. bombs.Dusseldorf.   (31st July/1st August.)7. 630 aircraft were directed against Dusseldorf. Photos of the result were-taken next morning, when 22 fires were seen to be still burning in the heart ofthe city and the docks.It is clear that very important destruction has been done in the docks;an area of 800 x 460 yards of warehouses, storehouses and other docking facilitieshas been totally destroyed; a paper factory, a cow-cake factory and a soap works have also been gutted.Adjacent to the main railway station, the great steel works of Schiess-Defries. which specialise in the production of magnetic mines, has been largelygutted.   These works are also important manufacturers of machine tools.It is evident that there is a vast number of major incidents of destructionin the residential and business quarters of the city, some involving entire blocks.There are also many additional incidents in the industrial suburbs of Neuss andOberhassel.At this stage it is not possible to estimate the total area of destruction orto enumerate the important buildings which have been destroyed.Power Stations in Northern France.   (19th and 20th July.)8. The object of these attacks is to put out of action the principal industrial area centred on the Lille and Bethune coalfields. These coalfields supply fuelfor the power stations, which in turn supply power to work the mines. If thesepower stations could be put out of action, not only would the mines and other important war industries in the Lille area have to close down, but the results would be felt throughout the whole of Occupied France.Attacks were carried out on five out of the ten main stations. aircraft operated in pairs at low level, and pressed home their attacks with determination.Photographs taken during the attacks were from too low a level to show theactual fall of bombs, but the crews&apos; reports indicate that hits were obtained proportionate least three stations. Damage assessment photographs have not yet beenobtained.[24225] B 2
Information regarding Previous Raids.Flensburg.9. In addition to the damage previously reported in this importantsubmarine building yard, photographs now show that the main frame and angle-bending shop of the Flensburger Schiffsbau- has been wrecked over an area of200 feet by 195 feet, with roof damage extending further along the shop, probablyinto the ship-building shop. Additional damage is also seen in the buildingslipways.The Ruhr.10. A further report has been received of damage to the Hoesch Steel works at Dortmund. The delay caused in production has been accentuated by the lack of skilled repair workers, and machinery and equipment had to stand idlefrom 8 to 14 days before repairs could be started.At Oberhaiisen the damage caused to the Babcock Boiler Works is reportedto have reduced output by a third.Successful attack on a Submarine.11. A photo is attached illustrating the successful attack on a submarineby an aircraft of this Command recorded in the last Summary.It shows numbers of her crew swimming in the swirl and oil left behindwhen she finally sank.Mining.12. A reliable source reports that our magnetic mines at present being dropped are causing considerable trouble, both to the Germans and the Swedes,owing&quot; to an alteration to their mechanism resulting in the failure of theirsweepers to deal with them effectively. Neither the Germans nor the Swedeshave yet discovered how to deal with this new weapon and the Trelleborg-SassnitzFerry Service has again been stopped until such time as a new device can be foundto enable the vessels to proceed in safety.The British Minister in Stockholm has reported that the Germans do not expect Swedish ore deliveries to be maintained at present level, owing to shipping shortage and the expectation of increasingly strong R.A.F. attacks on german ports.The only officially confirmed mining success to report during the periodof this summary is that of the Danish Virginia of 4,088 tons, which was damaged by a mine on the 21st July south of Telleborg.German A.R.P.13.   The following report has been received from a well-placed source :-&quot; Since the attack on Cologne the whole German A.R.P. system hashad to be reorganised. Up till that time the A.R.P. Services, including fire brigades, went into action as soon as a raid started, but the losses in A.R.P.personnel in Cologne were so great that it is unlikely this procedure willbe continued in the future. It is expected that instructions will shortly be given that, when large-scale raids occur, A.R.P. organisations shall not go into action until after the raid is over, even if the result is a considerableextension of the fires. This is a result of a study of the attack on Cologne,where the fires spread rapidly in any case. By the time the raid was over,so many A.R.P. personnel had been killed or injured, and so much equip-ment damaged, that it was impossible to deal adequately with the fires. Onthe other hand, had the A.R.P. and fire-fighting personnel been conservedvirtually intact until the short, sharp attack was over, it is believed that lessdamage would have been done.&quot;A. H. M.
