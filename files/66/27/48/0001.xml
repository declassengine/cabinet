2COMBINED OPERATION.1. A combined operation was carried out against Dieppe at dawn on the19th August. The object of this operation was the destruction of local defences,power stations, aerodrome installations near the town and the capture andremoval or destruction of German invasions barges and other craft. Althoughstrategical surprise was impossible, tactical surprise was achieved.- and thesynchronisation of each part of the assault was perfect. The Force Commandersagreed that the inter-service co-operation throughout was of a very high standard.The force to be landed consisted mainly of Canadians, but includedSpecial Service troops, royal Marines, a detachment from the United StatesBanger battalion and a small contingent of the Fighting French.The crossing was successful except for a chance encounter by part of theflotilla with enemy flak ships and E-boats. Our craft dispersed, and in the ensuing battle one flak ship was sunk and another damaged; the flotilla thenreformed. Minesweeping was successfully carried out. and H.M. DestroyerCalpe (Force Commander&apos;s H.Qs. ship) led the force through the minefield. TheDieppe harbour light remained on until our forces had got quite close. the destroyers carried out a preliminary bombardment quite successfully, but foundthat the coastal artillery was a good deal stronger than had been anticipated.Simultaneously, Bostons and Hurricanes attacked coastal batteries and beaches,the main effort being directed against five heavy gun positions, one of which appeared to have been put out of action. Smoke-screens were laid by some of theBostons. Our fighters maintained a standing patrol of six squadrons over the target area up to 0620, when it was reduced to three squadrons.Landings were made on six beaches. One flank attack by 265 men was verysuccessfully carried out and a 6-inch gun battery was completely put out ofaction. 160 Germans killed and four taken prisoner. The other flank attack,the scale of which was reduced by half through the chance encounter with E-boatspreviously mentioned, succeeded in interfering with the coastal battery on this front, &quot;but did not destroy it. These two successful actions enabled our ships to operate off Dieppe for the whole of the nine hours. Of the four landings in thecentre, the first was successful and the Canadians fought their way inland, and,although the second landing was successful, the Canadians were held up by veryfierce opposition. On the other two beaches the opposition was again very fierce,but 18 tanks were got ashore. Great difficulty was experienced in the necessarydemolition of the sea wall to enable tanks to get through, and, although some ofthem were able to operate most of the day round the Casino grounds, strongtank obstructions prevented them breaking into the town. A radio locationstation was destroyed.Enemy air reaction started slowly but by 1000, over 80 enemy aircraft,including a number of bombers escorted by F.W. 190s. were over the target area to attack our shipping, and the fighter cover was accordingly increased to6 squadrons, which was maintained until 1645.From 1000 onwards it was clear that the operation would not succeed, andthe commanders decided not to land the remainder of the tanks. Embarkationcommenced at 1106. From 1200 onwards enemy bombers continued to attack, but were unescorted apart from the general fighter cover which the enemy wasmaintaining.By 1215 the situation on the beaches was grave and orders were given toblow up the tanks, which had met with considerable artillery fire. By 1410 thelast ship of the force was three miles clear on the return journey, and the forcearrived in harbour without further interference, covered by our fighters. FiftyGerman prisoners were brought back.Of the Naval force taking part, H.M. Destroyer Berkeley was damaged by bombing and subsequently sunk. H.M. Destroyers&apos; Calpe, Brocklesby, the Polishdestroyer Slazak and a steam gun-boat were damaged. 42 landing craft were sunk or missing out of a total of 167.  Naval casualties were 100 missing.Of the 6,100 soldiers taking part about one-third are missing, and of these the Germans claim 1,500 prisoners.Air support to the operation was supplied by about 56 fighteij squadrons^including three United States Squadrons (involving a total of 2,366 sorties), sixArmy Co-operation squadrons, three Bomber Command squadrons and 24 UnitedStates Fortresses. In the heavy air fighting which took place, 93 entmy aircraft were destroyed, 39 were probably destroyed and 140 were damaged. Included, inthese casualties were 149 F.W. 190s, and more than 100 bombers. Our losses were98 aircraft of Fighter Command (68 pilots are missing), 12 Army Co-operationCommand aircraft and three Bostons of Bomber Command.
247NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.2. A number of attacks on enemy shipping have been reported by our submarines.Several engagements have been fought by light craft in the Channel.Shipping casualties have been heavy, owing to U-boat attacks.  Losses have occurred in convoys in the Caribbean and in a homeward bound Atlantic convoy.Home Waters and North Atlantic.3. During the night of 13th/14th, four M.G.Bs. engaged three armed trawlers off the Channel Islands, possibly sinking one trawler and damaginganother.   The M.G.Bs. received slight damage.On the night of 16th /17th, M.G.Bs. were in action with several R-boats offDover. One enemy craft was boarded and taken in tow but subsequentlyabandoned on fire; another was rammed and others were damaged. Thirteenprisoners were taken. Some damage and casualties were caused in the M.G.Bs.The following night, four M.T.Bs. in the Channel attacked an enemy convoywhich had previously been shelled by our coastal batteries. Strong opposition was encountered, but one escort vessel was probably damaged. M.T.B. 43 was abandoned and M.T.B. 218 was mined and sunk. Our casualties were nine killed and two wounded. M.T.B. 204 picked up ten German prisoners who had beenin a dinghy since the previous night&apos;s action.In an engagement with E-boats oft&apos; Yarmouth on the night of 19th/20th,one E-boat was seriously damaged by H.M. Destroyer Hamble-don.Fourteen Danish fishing vessels were captured by H.M. Destroyer Vanity onthe 18th off the Dogger Bank. One was sunk after capture and the remainderhave arrived in East Coast ports.H.M. Submarine P. 54 attacked three north-bound ships off the norwegian coast on the 12th, and probably sank two of them. On the same day, H.M.Submarine Sturgeon torpedoed one of two escorted ships north-west of the Naze.H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Cheshire, escorting the homeward bound convoy from Freetown, was torpedoed east of the Azores on the 18th. She wasnot seriously damaged and was able to proceed with the convoy.A large U.S.A. troop convoy, escorted by U.S.A. warships, arrived in home waters on the 17th.Northern Waters and Baltic.4. The Russian Submarines D.3 and M. 176 were lost on patrol in july and the M. 173 is overdue and is presumed lost.The Russian Submarine SHCHA. 402 claims to have sunk one ship of6,000 tons and another of 8,000 tons on the 8th and 11th.Mediterranean.5. Of the 14 ships in the convoy to Malta, reported in last week&apos;s Resume,nine ships totalling 88,588 tons, are now known to have sunk.At least two E-boats were sunk during the passage of the convoy.Preliminary estimates of enemy aircraft shot down show 39 destroyed, fiveprobables and nine damaged by fighters from the Fleet, in addition to a minimum of eight destroyed and two probables by the ships&apos; gunfire. Fighters from.M. Aircraft Carrier Indomitable shot down 28, probably destroyed six and damaged ten.  Eight naval fighters were lost but four of the pilots were saved.Three officers and 142 men from H.M.S. Manchester were picked up byH.M. ships, and 562 other survivors have been interned by the Vichy French.During the period of the operation, H.M. Cruisers Cleopatra and A rethusa,with four destroyers and the co-operation of naval aircraft, shelled.the harbour and flour mills at Rhodes on the night of 12th/13th. One of these destroyers,H.M.S. Javelin, claims to have sunk a U-boat west of Cyprus.6. A reinforcement of 29 Spitfires was flown off to Malta from.M.S. Furious on the 17th.7.   Naval aircraft have carried out anti-submarine patrols on each night ofthe week, in addition to providing escorts for ships returning to Gibraltar.Mersa Matruh harbour was bombed by seven Albacores on the night of 13th/14th[24244] B
During the past three weeks, upwards of 20 armed power lighters have been destroyed off the Libyan and Egyptian coasts by naval aircraft.8.   The following attacks have been reported by H.M. submarines : Traveller claims two hits with torpedoes on the former YugoslavTraining Ship Dalmacija (2.300 tons) which was being escorted north-east of Ancona on 31st July. Proteus, in an attack on three escorted ships inthe JEgean on 7th August, sank one ship of 7.000 tons, and probably damaged another of 9.000 tons, in addition to sinking two schooners andtwo caiques. P. 42 destroyed a southbound goods train by gunfire on the8th, north of Longbardi (on the Italian mainland north of the Straits ofMessina). Utmost and P. 46 have reported a possible hit on a ship atMarittimo on the 10th. Porpoise sank a ship south of Crete on the 12thand, four days later, torpedoed and left sinking a large ship in convoybetween Crete and Cyrenaica. Turbulent, on the 17th, torpedoed two shipsescorted by three destroyers, south-west of Navarino. P. 43 probablytorpedoed a south-bound ship of 5,000 tons off Paxos Island, west coast of greece, on the night 19th/20th.9.   H.M. Submarine Thorn is overdue from patrol and is presumed lost.H.M. Destroyer Paladin shot down an enemy torpedo aircraft north of port Said on the 17th.The s.s. Princess Marguerite (5,875 tons) carrying about 1,000 troops, was sunk 45 miles north of Port Said on the 17th.   There were about 1,100 survivors.During the week 23,994 tons of French merchant shipping eastbound and21.025 tons westbound have passed Gibraltar under escort.Pacific.,10. H.M. Australian Cruiser Canberra was sunk in a night action with japanese destroyers on the 8th off the Solomons.   There are 733 survivors.Anti-Submarine Operations.11. A U.S.A. Catalina sank a U-boat south-east of Iceland (C) on the 20th;53 prisoners were picked up by H.M. destroyer Castleton.The s.s. Duchess of Bedford (20.123 tons) claims to have sunk a U-boat by gunfire in the Atlantic on the 9th. In the Mediterranean, in addition to theU-boat claimed as sunk by H.M. Destroyer Javelin, H.M. Submarine Travellerdamaged a U-boat by gunfire in the Adriatic on the 5th. A number of incon-clusive attacks were carried out by the escorts of a homeward-bound convoy fromFreetown. The Dutch Submarine 0. 21 unsuccessfully attacked a U-boat in theS.W. Approaches.Twenty-five attacks have been carried out by aircraft: two in the N.W.Approaches, ten in the S.W. Approaches, including one some 600 miles to the westward of Ireland (R), five in the Bay of Biscay, one east of the Azores, one in the Levant and six in the West Atlantic. Although there has been no definite evidence of destruction, damage is possible in some ten of these attacks. Wreckagewas seen in three cases and, in one case, wounded were landed in Spain from an italian U-boat which had been damaged by depth-charges from an aircraft.Enemy Intelligence.German.12. The Pocket Battleship Lutzow and the Cruisers Leipzig and Numb ergwere sighted by air reconnaissance on the 16th at Swinemunde.Ten destroyers of a new class are under construction in an Eastern Balticport and three or more are expected to be ready by the end of the year. Thesecraft are of the same class as our &quot; Hunt &quot; class destroyers and carry 4&quot; guns.At present the German fleet is estimated to include a total of 17 destroyers and27 torpedo boats.Japanese.13. The battleships and aircraft-carriers of the main fleet are still in home waters and the carrier force appears to be still exercising in southern Japanesewaters. There has been no indication of the movement of any considerable force to the Solomon Islands.
243U-boats.14. Although groups of U-boats are disposed on the North Atlantic convoyroutes, only one ocean convoy has been heavily attacked. There has been consider-able activity against convoys between Key West and Trinidad.The number of Japanese U-boats operating in New Guinea and the Solomonsmay be as high as 24.Protection of Seaborne Trade.15. During the week ending the 16th/17th August, 883 ships, including261 Allied and 17 neutral, have been convoyed. Of these, 183 were in oceanconvoys and 700 in British coastal convoys. One cruiser, two anti-aircraft ships,one armed merchant cruiser, 66 destroyers (including four U.S.A. destroyers), and99 sloops, cutters and corvettes were employed on escort duty.During the week 73 ships in three ocean convoys arrived in Home waters without loss.16. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 15th August totalled 574,000 tons, compared with 721,000 tons duringthe previous seven days, and an average of 657,000 tons for the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports 79,000 tons were mineral oils of various grades. Thesefigures include those for a homeward-bound Atlantic convoy, in which elevenships were sunk by U-boat attack.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.17. Twenty-nine ships are reported, to have been attacked by U-boats duringthe week; of these 22 are known to have sunk. Of the 15 ships ^attacked in theWestern Atlantic 11 ships in the Caribbean were sailing in United States convoys.Five Brazilian ships, including one carrying troops, were attacked off the south american coast. Four ships in a homeward bound convoy from Freetown were torpedoed north of the Azores and one ship in convoy was sunk south of Iceland(C). Three ships were attacked to the west of Freetown. A schooner carryingpetrol was sunk in the Levant.Two ships were attacked by Japanese aircraft in the Bay of Bengal. in air attacks in Home Waters a trawler wras sunk at Eastbourne and two fishing vessels were sunk at Salcombe. . The s.s. Richmond Castle (7,798 tons), withfrozen meat from South America, was torpedoed and sunk in mid-Atlantic onthe 3rd August.British Minelaying.18. Minelaying by motor-launches took place on two nights of the week offthe Flemish coast. R.A.F. aircraft laid mines on five nights, off the frisian islands, off Heligoland, in the Baltic and off the east coast of Denmark. Inaddition Naval Swordfish laid mines off the French Channel coast.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.19. There has been considerable minelaying by E-boats, mainly in LymeBay and also off the Kentish coast. Twenty-eight mines were destroyed duringthe week, eleven of them off the Needles. Minelaying by aircraft was on a small scale.The mine totals now are : 1,316 acoustic, 2,565 magnetic and 1,487 moored.Foreign Waters.20. A small dangerous area has been declared off Cleveland, Queensland.The entrances to the Savannah River, Georgia, and St. John&apos;s River, Florida,were temporarily closed to shipping owing to suspected mining.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)[24244] - b 2
Finland.21.   The Germans are believed to be continuing with preparations for an offensive against Murmansk.Northern and Central Sectors.22. The Russians have intensified their attacks against the Germanpositions at various points, particularly in the Rzhev area. Their successes,however, remain of a local nature only. The Germans, for their part, have also made.local advances in the area north-west of Orel, though at heavy cost.Voronezh Sector.23. Despite continued Russian attacks, the Germans retain their bridge-head over the Don and their hold on the town of Voronezh.Stalingrad Sector.24. In the north-east corner of the Don bend the Germans claim to haveovercome Russian resistance and to have reached the river. This is probablysubstantially correct, although some Russian forces are still holding out withinthe river bend. The Germans are now attempting to establish bridgeheadsacross the river due west of Stalingrad. South-west of Stalingrad, in the advancefrom Kotelnikovski, the Germans have made little fresh progress against stubbornRussian resistance.Caucasus Sector.25. The Germans are continuing their advance into Caucasia in four mainthrusts. From the River Manich area they have begun to advance south-eastwardsin the general direction of the Middle and Lower Kuma. They are also advancingin a south-easterly direction from Pyatigorsk, and are approaching the railway junction of Prokhladenski. Farther westward, in an advance up the courseof the River Kuban, the Germans have reached well into the mountains. Lastly,they have advanced from the area .of Maikop south-westwards towards the port ofTuapse. Their progress, however, has been slow, and in the Krasnodar area theRussians are resisting strongly.Summary.26. The Germans continue to meet with strong Russian resistance in their efforts to approach Stalingrad, both from the west and the south-west. Strate-gically, Stalingrad, if captured, would prove their highest prize. For, by thuslinking the line of the Don with that of the Lower Volga, they would have a secure left flank from Voronezh to Astrakhan, and their hold on Caucasia wouldbe confirmed. In Caucasia itself they are now in possession of one of the twosmaller oilfields lying north of the Caucasus range that of Maikop, reported bythe Russians to have been &quot; scorched &quot; and are evidently making for the secondat Grozni. Over the Caucasus chain there are two main routes the Georgianhighway, running southward from Ordjonikidze, and the Ossetian highway,running southward from Alagir. The Germans would be able to approach thelatter route by the capture of Prokhladenski and by an advance up the course ofthe River Terek. Their present thrust up the River Kuban, however, leads themto no recognised road over the mountains.27. The Germans now claim to have taken over 1 million Russian prisonerssince the opening of their campaign on the Kerch Peninsula in early May. TheRussians themselves put their total of casualties over almost the same period atover 600,000. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the Russian armies of thesouth have suffered heavily. Recently, however, reports have begun to come inwhich indicate that German losses in the recent fighting have also been heavy.Egypt.28. Patrols on both sides have been active during the week. On the night ofthe 12th/13th August a small-scale raid by one of our sub-units in the northernsector found enemy forward trenches deserted. Both sides continue to consolidatetheir present positions and to build up their forces. ;29. Units of 164 German Infantry Division, which was formerly located inCrete and the Salonika area, have been identified in the front line in Egypt,and it is probable that the greater part of the division has been transported to
Africa. It is also possible that further reinforcements are en route. There istherefore reason to believe that Rommel will attack when his supply situationpermits. This, although improved, is probably still strained, partly on accountof effective raids by the R.A.F. on coastal shipping forward of Tobruk and partly as a result of the activity of our submarines.India.A ssam ]Burma Frontier.30. Our patrols report that the Japanese have withdrawn from theHomalin, Kalemyo and Gangaw areas west of the Chindwin, and the situation has been very quiet throughout this sector. Further south one of our patrolspenetrated to Buthidaung, north of Akyab, and sank a Japanese requisitionedsteamer.On the Indian side of the frontier further heavy rains have causedlandslides, interrupting road traffic.Far East.South-West Pacific.31.   Patrol activity in the Kokoda area of New Guinea continued.South Pacific.32. There is no information on the progress of the operations in thesouth-east Solomons beyond that available in Press reports. It appears that theUnited States forces are now established on Florida and Guadalcanal Islands.AIR SITUATION.General.33. Air support on a heavy scale was provided for the combined operations on Dieppe.Coastal Command activity against U-boats has been on a more extensive scale.Bomber Command aircraft attacked Dusseldorf, Osnabruck and Flensburg.United Kingdom.34. Fighter Command flew 1,074 defensive sorties by day and 397 by night.These included 100 sorties by aircraft of the U.S. Army Air Corps. &apos;Eighty-seven enemy aircraft flew overland by day compared with 51 lastweek; some rather ineffective sorties were flown by bombers and fighter-bombers.Activity was mainly along the South Coast.By night the enemy effort was slight and consisted only of scattered raidsby a maximum of 15 aircraft, mainly over the Eastern Counties.Six enemy aircraft were destroyed, including two shot down by A.A. guns.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.35. Fighter and Bomber Commands despatched 3,357 and 197 sorties respectively, compared with 1,392 and 74 last week. In addition, 42 sorties were carried out by U.S.A. Fortresses. (These figures include the aircraft whichoperated&apos; in the Dieppe raid.)U.S.A. Fortresses with fighter escort made a successful high level attackon the railway centre at Sotteville (Rouen). The results are reported inAppendix VII.Mustangs of Army Co-operation Command and Spitfires attacked aero-dromes, railway targets and other objectives in Occupied Territory.Nine sweeps, involving 30 squadrons of Spitfires (including one U:S.A.A.C.squadron) encountered small enemy opposition.In these operations four enemy aircraft were destroyed, four were probably destroyed and six were damaged. Two Mustangs and eight Spitfires (two pilotssafe) are missing. ,Aircraft of the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit flew 130&quot;sorties.
Night.. 36. Bomber Command despatched 386 aircraft against land targets, corn-pared with 779 last week. Three medium scale attacks were made on Dusseldorf,Osnabruck and Flensburg respectively, but on each occasion extreme darknessand thick haze were encountered. A total of about 720 tons of H.E. andincendiaries was dropped approximately equally among the three objectives.Dusseldorf was identified by only a few aircraft, and these reported firesin various parts of the town.The accuracy of the attack on Osnabruck is confirmed by photographs taken on the day following, which show that considerable damage was inflicted. (SeeAppendix VII.)At Flensburg, scattered fires were seen in the town and shipyards, and one.,aircraft reported that sheds in the submarine yards were burning.From these, and intruder operations, which were on a small scale, 14 of our aircraft are missing. Three enemy aircraft were destroyed and another was probably destroyed.Coastal Operations.37. Coastal Command flew 517 sorties, of which 214 were on anti-submarineoperations and 71 on convoy escort. A further 42 anti-submarine patrols were carried out by aircraft of Bomber Command. Shipping protection patrols by fighter Command involved 563 sorties, of which 12 were by the U.S.A.A.C.- Lancasters on anti-shipping patrols attacked and hit an &quot; Altmark &quot; typetanker off Portugal. This vessel was later attacked by a Sunderland, which scoredanother hit near the bridge.Off the Dutch Coast a small reporting vessel and an armed motor launch were sunk, and two tugs were damaged off Dunkirk.A total of 114 aircraft of Bomber Command laid 299 sea mines in enemy waters.About 125 enemy shipping and weather reconnaissances were flown off ourcoasts. Interceptions resulted in the destruction of one Ju. 88 and damage to two others.  A F.W. 200 was destroyed off Iceland (C).In the week&apos;s operations nine aircraft are missing.Mediterranean.Egypt and Libya.38. In the week ending the 17th August our aircraft flew 1,210 sortiescompared with 1,719 in the previous week.Activity over the battle area was on a reduced scale. Fighter-bomber attacks were made on enemy M.T., one of which was carried out against about 100--vehicles east of El Dhaba. and was particularly effective. Offensive patrolsencountered very little enemy opposition and only a few combats were reported.One patrol of Spitfires attacked a formation of Me. 109s and Macchi 202s; four of the enemy fighters were shot down and eight others were probably destroyed or damaged.  One Spitfire force-landed, but the pilot is safe.A successful attack was made on Fuka by Bostons and Baltimores escorted by 46 fighters; direct hits and near misses were made on grounded aircraft, alarge building and some tents were hit, and fires were caused at the railway station. One Me. 109 was shot down : a Kittyhawk is missing and six Kitty-hawks, the pilots of which are safe, force-landed.Frequent searches for enemy coastal shipping in the Gulf of Sollum were carried out by Hudsons and Blenheims. A number of attacks were made onF-boats (tank landing craft) and on convoys of barges, as a result of which atleast six F-boats and four barges were sunk or seriously damaged. During oneof these raids Beaufighters shot down two Ju. 52s. into the sea off Sidi Barrani.Light bombers twice attacked the harbour at Mersa Matruh, causing large fires.Shipping and harbour installations at Tobruk were heavily bombed at duskand at night by Halifaxes, Wellingtons and U.S.A. Liberators.&apos; Some large fires were started in the harbour, hits were made on the jetties and several ships werestraddled and near misses obtained. Other aircraft attacked Mersa Matruh and dropped mines in the harbour; in one of these attacks 10 U.S.A.A.C. B. 25sparticipated for the first time, and were assisted by naval Albacores with flares.Enemy offensive operations were on a very small scale; some fighter-bomberattacks were carried out in the battle area, but caused no damage.
250Malta.39. On the 13th and 14th from before dawn to dusk Spitfires andBeaufighters provided complete protection for the incoming convoy. during these two days 16 enemy aircraft were shot down, two others were probably destroyed and nine damaged, for the loss of five of our fighters, of which two pilotswere saved. Thereafter a continuous Spitfire patrol was maintained duringunloading, and no attempt was made to bomb Malta during that period.A reinforcement of 29 Spitfires reached Malta.Sea Communications.40. At dusk on the 15th August U.S.A. Liberators attacked an enemyconvoy south-wrest of Crete; one large vessel was hit and later reported to be on fire. During the night Wellingtons again attacked this convoy and made a hitwhich resulted in a violent explosion. On the night 18th/ 19th August a vessel of 6,000 tons was probably hit with a torpedo north of Tobrnk.A supply vessel of 7,000 tons escorted by four destroyers and six aircraft was intercepted by Beauforts, Beaufighters and Spitfires from Malta. Two hitswith torpedoes were made and a Beaufighter attacking with bombs made a hit onthe stern. The vessel was stationary and listing to port, and was later reportedto have exploded and sunk. The escorting ships were attacked with cannon and machine-gun fire.   Two enemy aircraft were damaged.Rhodes.41. In conjunction with the naval bombardment, Maritza and Calato, thetwo main air bases on Rhodes, were bombed by Wellingtons. Particularly large fires were observed at Calato, where bombs were dropped among a considerablenumber of dispersed aircraft.Russia.German Air Force Operations.42. Air operations during the past week have continued, over the mainRussian Front between the Gulf of Finland and the Caucasus mountains.The chief area of activity continues to be Southern Russia, particularly insupport of the attack on Stalingrad, and air attacks have been made on Russianreinforcements moving; westward and on railway and road communications in theStalingrad area.Air operations have increased somewhat in the North Caucasus, where attacks have been made on shipping, including naval vessels, and. on harbour installationsat the Black- Sea ports, while support has been given to the German army in itsthrust towards the ports and to the south along the line Krasnodar AMaikop-Piatigorsk.Further air support has been provided for advanced army units attempting to force a way over the, military roads of the Caucasus Range. Heavy attacks were also made on railways and rolling stock in the North Caucasus area. air reconnaissance is believed to have been on a wide scale, covering especially theStalingrad-Astrakhan areas, and extending to Transcaucasus.On either sector of the Russian Front intensified air operations are indicatedin the areas of Voronezh, Rzhev and south of Lake Ilmen at Staraya Russa, wheremuch of the activity appears to have been in support of defensive measures taken against Russian attacks.Burma.43. The only offensive operations reported during the week are small-scaleattacks on Rangoon and Kalemyo. Supplies were dropped for Chinese troops at Fort Hertz.China.44. On the 10th, United States aircraft attacked Hankow city and aerodromes, with incendiaries.On the following day. Yochow (100 miles south of Hankow) was bombed and many fives were started.
Pacific Zone.45. United States bombers attacked an enemy convoy anchored off Gona,and later during its passage back to Rabaul. Enemy fighters intercepted andthree of these were destroyed, two probably destroyed and six damaged.R.A.A.F. Hudsons attacked Mape and become in Timor, and enemy positions at Bobonare (16 miles north of Timor).Twenty-four enemy bombers made a high-level attack on Seven Milesaerodrome (Port Moresby). Some aircraft on the ground were damaged and a building was destroyed.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.46. There was no concentrated bombing during the week, but there havebeen incidents on every night except the last and on every day except the16th August. The daylight bombing occurred chiefly at towns lying on the south coast. The few incidents that occurred at night were, except for Swindon, of a minor character.Damage.47.   The more important incidents were as follows : Teignmouth (13th August). The Town Hall, the Arcade, the Fire station were destroyed and the gasworks set alight.Salisbury and Bognor Regis (14th August).  Damage to house property.Folkestone and Littlehampton (loth August).   Damage to house property.Swanage (17th August).   Damage to shops and other buildings.-*Ventnor and Folkestone (18th August).  Houses destroyed and damaged.Swindon (night 7th/18th August). A G.W.R. workshop and a number ofhouses damaged.Casualties.48. The estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hoursthe 19th August are 79 killed and 90 seriously injured, of which there were20 killed and 25 seriously injured at Swindon.
