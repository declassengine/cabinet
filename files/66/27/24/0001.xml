Convoys,It is not possible to embark on more than one of oheseoperations at the same time and, in addition, a certainamount of time is required to transfer the forces from oneoperation to another^Apart from other considerations it was not possible to run a P.Q*  Convoy in August owing to the necessity forrunning a Malta Convoy.It is intended to run a P* ]. Convoy early in Septemberbut it is impossible to say at present how many, if anyPfurther P.Q. Convoys it will be possible to run during theremainder of 1942* if Operation TORCH takes place as early as is hoped, itwill not be possible to run another PoQ. Convoy before TORCH.Whether it will be possible to run one or two P,QaConvoys between the completion of -TORCH and the end of the year will depend on how soon it is possible to withdraw -the&apos;necessary Naval forces for.a P*Q* Convoy from TORCH.It is possible that the requirements of TORCH subsequent,to the actual operation may preclude another PoQ* Convoy beingrun during 1942*On the other hand, if Operation 20RCH has unfortunatelyto be carried out at a date later than the present target dateit may be possible to carry out another PBQ* Convoy in Octoberbefore TORCH.     Whether or not it will be possible in thesecircumstances to carry out a P*Q. Convoy between TORCH and theend of the year it is impossible to say for the reasons given above.Should it be necessary to run a further Malta Convoy it.must inevitably be at the expense of a PoQ. Convoyo I will endeavour to give at least 6 weeks&apos; warning for each Convoy,,(Intd,) A.V.A.Admiralty, S.W*1*,6TH AUGUST,  1942.
