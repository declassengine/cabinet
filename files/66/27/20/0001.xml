It was noted in the course ofdiscussion that the Viceroy had not yet put forward any specific proposals as to&apos;the action which should be taken.with regard to that resolution or thegeneral menace of civil, disobedience: .. but the::Cabinet approved thesuggestion that the Viceroy should at once, be given an assurance that ifthe Government of India found it necessary to take strong measures theywould receive full support;   and a telegram to that effect was accordinglydespatched the same day.On the 1Ath July the Working Committee adopted a further resolutiondemanding the immediate withdrawal of British power from India andthreatening, in the event of refusal, the launching, of a campaign ofnon-violent resistance to Government.     : This resolution was adopted,subject to confirmation by the All-India Congress Committee.-Government of India&apos; a information indicates that .:it&apos; is practically certainthat, whether very quickly or after protracted discussion, it will endorse the All-India Committee meets at;Bombay on the&apos; 7;th August, and thethe resolution recommended by the Working Commit bee, r &apos;Since the middle of July a, vory considerable and rapid exchange of telegrams with the Government of India has taken place dealing vrith thelegal/

AEKKNDIOES.Telegram from Secretary of State to Governor-Generaldated 2^th July, 1%2.IMMEDIATE13166,        Personal.     Many thanks for your personal telegrams of the17th July, 2111-S and 20th July, 2136-S.     I am in general agreement.I accept your view that action need not &quot;be taken at the moment andam only anxious that preparations should be complete to strikeeffectively when the time comes.2.        Points in this and third paragraph are- to clear my own &quot;mind and avoid any controversies at last moment. &apos;&quot;-&apos;--  understand that Inregard to the Working Committee in general, you propose to&quot; take action for arrest and detention.under.Defence of India Rules.     I. am &quot;hot quite clear why you. contemplate talcing, action against Gandhi under RegulationIII of .1818,, for Defence Rule 26(l)(b) seems&apos;-to apply equally to him.There has been an indication already of criticism of the possible&apos;useof this century-old regulation and if action under the Defence Ruleswould be equally effective would it. not be preferable not to singleout Gandhi for special. form:. of -action v/hich is open to criticism as beingtaken under can authority which is obsolete and which by &quot;its very terms,suggests a lack;; of; sufficient ground-for more ordinary proceedings?     Wemust face the fact, that whatever may-be possible&apos;&quot; as to keeping place of detention secret, fact of arrest cannot be kept -dark and that nctwith-standing general- opinion of Congress&apos;-^responsibility for the breakdown of the Cripps mission and despite strong criticism of resolutions ofWorking Committee-, ; there-;-will -be unfavourable reactions in America and elsewhere to the- arrest of. Congress-&quot;leaders,&quot;     Subject always to thecondition of effective action it would&apos;&apos;seem preferable not to&apos;&apos;exacerbate these reactions, by.: use 3f - &quot;power&quot; open in itself to criticism, *
3c I note that you contemplate the possibility tliat in the eventof the All-India Committee endorsing the resolutions of 10th and 14thJuly, Congress should &quot;be declared an -unlawful association.     Am Icorrect in understanding that this would be supplemental measurefollowing on, and not as a preliminary step for action againstleaders which would be taken tinder other powers?     I presume that infact the necessity for action against Congress as a whole under the criminal Lav/ Amendment Act would not arise till .the effect of thearrests of the leaders had &quot;been seen.4. As regards disposal of leaders after arrest, I am, inprinciple, in favour of suggestion in your telegram of 19th.July,2130-S., that they should be removed outside India, and am askingColonial Secretary at once to make necessary enquiries confidentiallyas to detention in Uganda and also Aden (see next paragraph).     Legalaspect, including effect of proviso to Defence Rule 26(l)(a) has alreadybeen considered in the case of the Pir Pagaro and any legal difficulties have, I imagine, &quot;been surmounted.5c        Dramatic effect to which your Advisers attach value of suddenarrest and removal by air to distant inaccessible and temporarily atleast secret destination would no doubt be to some extent weakenedif Gandhi and possibly others had to be kept in India on medical grounds.     But we must chance this,     Gandhi and others unfit for airjourney would at any rate be separated from the rest.     Have youconsidered possibility of sending Gandhi by sea to Aden?   This wouldnot involve the risks to high blood pressure resulting from highaltitude either during flight or at elevated destination such as .Ugandac     If Gandhi hunger-strikes in whatever place of destinationwe must, of course, see it through, though that is a very different matter from ourselves adopting method of removal which would belikely to cause his early demise.6.        I am glad to see that Pirozkhan Noon has already spoken out and that Ramaswami Ayyar has also been helpful.telegram/

First stage now nearing completion has &quot;been-usefullyemployed in propaganda and public opinion inside and outside India isnow probably more prepared to support strong action than might havebeen the case a few weeks a.go,2.  &apos;   Ratification of Working Committee1 s resolution withoutsubstantial amendment (and no-amendment will be regarded as substantialunless it unambiguously removes threat of mass movement) will markcommencement of second stage,.    As soon as. this takes place Bombay-Government&apos; will inform Government of India., all Provincial Governments,Chief&quot;Commissioners and Political&apos;Residents&apos;by telegram containingpre-arranged code. word.     No action will however be started untilGovernment of India send all above addressees further telegramcontaining another pre-arranged codeword which will be the signal for action.   ..- (This will give opportunity for last minute consideration here and enable us to synchronise action suitably. e,g.. giving Bombay, ifnecessary, a short start over the others.&quot;)&apos;&apos;-&apos; 3. .-  On receipt of telegram from Government -of. India,(a) Bombay Government will arrest. Gandhi.-and all members of working committee v/ho may be in Bombay under-Defence Rule. 26. -(b) Each Provincial Government will proclaim under criminal law Amendment Act Congreps Working Committee, All-India CongressCommittee and each Provincial Congress Committee operating within itsjurisdiction/

No individual will be arrested merely as member of unlawful association general object being not to fill the jails but to limit the number of arreststo those regarded as essential for dislocation of the Congressorganisation.     Important that organisers from British India who may take refuge in Indian States will be arrested by the applicationfrom Provincial Governments to Political Officers concerned,Bombay Government will not arrest any individual who does notbelong to Bombay Province except those-mentioned in (a) above.4-.     Simultaneously with issue of their telegram Governmentof India will publish&apos;statement containing K.M. Government&apos;srejection of Congress proposal already implicit in answer to parliamentary question of June 30th and their own denunciation of Congress/: and&apos;its&apos;leaders. L   &apos; &apos;5.     If any member of &quot;forking Committee abstains fromattending Bombay meeting on grounds which might reasonably be interpreted as indicating lack of sympathy with Congress resolutionhe will not be arrested itraaediately but his reactions to the otherarrestsiwill be awaited,   - Any member who&quot; is prevented fromattendingCby unavoidable-^circumstances will be arrested in hisprovince/

Gandhi will be arrested under Defence Rule- 26 and notRegulation 3 and will be detained in Bombay Presidency and notSevagram.     Mahadev Desai, Mira Ben and Doctor Sushila Nair (ladydoctor) will be permitted to accompany Gandhi if they voluntarilyaccept restrictions on communication which will be imposed on Gandhihimself,     If first two refuse to accept these conditions they-will alsobe arrested under Defence Rule 26,     Lady doctor will, not be arrested: but will not of course be allowed to attend on Gandhi.; unless she. acceptsconditions..;       7*     Place or places in which members of Working Committeearrested in Bombay (except Mrs. Sarojini Naidu) -will be confined .has not yet been finally settled but will probably be in BombayPresidency,     Mrs, Naidu will accompany Gandhi,     Any member of.Working Committee arrested in province other than Bombay will,be sentto join other members later if Provincial Government, so desiresi     Wholeparty may have to be temporarily confined in Yeravda Jail immediately,--after arrest.8.

(1)   If unfavourable (sic ? unfortunately) Gandhi fasts,&quot;cat   and mouse&quot; procedure will be followed as on previous occasions.He will be given every facility to take food and receive constantmedical attention but will be released   as soon as his life is in danger to avoid possibility of his death as a prisoner.  ,  whethersimilar procedure should apply to members of &quot;forking Committee ifthey go on hunger strike is under consideration.   .11.   Dangers of widespread protests demonstrations and possibleoutbreak of disorder resulting from above action are realised and provincial Governments will take all possible precautionary step3in consultation where necessary with military authorities who havealready been&apos;warned by general headquarters.       we are consideringurgent amendment of Defence of India Rules to enable shops for sale offood and other essential commodities to be kept open by force ifnecessary if hartals are proclaimed,12,     Main object of action would be to render movement abortiveby removing its leaders.     Policy should therefore be to discredit andimmobilise leaders, while doing as little as possible to antagoniserank and file, and to stress preventive character of action taken.13.     Third stage will supervene if attempts to abort movementfails.     At this stage but not before it may be necessary to proclaimIndian National Congress and promulgate Emergency Powers Ordinance,There will be no delay in talcing latter step if movement is actuallylaunched-     Provincial Governments should send telegraphic reports as necessary during first week summarising reactions to arrests.andother initial action and asking&apos;for promulgation of ordinance as soonas they consider situation demands it.     :&apos;12f, , .
