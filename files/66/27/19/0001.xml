(Co C&quot;*^THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1942.SECRET.W.P. (42) 339.August 5, 1942.WAR CABINET.RUSSIAN VIEWS ABOUT A SECOND FRONT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I THINK that my colleagues may like to see the annexed cable to the Editorof the News Chronicle from Mr. Paul Winterton, Special Correspondent of thatnewspaper in Moscow, about the attitude of the Russian people towards thequestion of a Second Front.A. E.Foreign Office, Augusts, 1942.Annex.Moscow, July 25, 1942.YOU ask me for recent Russian Second Front reactions. I have refrainedin the past from talking very much about this lest you should think I hadmerely fallen for Second Front propaganda, but I will now give you the factswith absolute frankness.When the Anglo-Soviet Treaty was announced some weeks ago and aSecond Front in 1942 was mentioned, there was tremendous enthusiasm all overthe Soviet Union and for a few days Britain achieved, a popularity here thatwas without precedent. All that enthusiasm has now completely evaporated.The change is largely attributable, of course, to the sudden new call upon Sovietlife and strength as a result of Germany&apos;s southern offensive. Russia seesherself once again meeting virtually unaided a full-scale Nazi attack and once more being the only fighting country making substantial sacrifices in life. Shefeels that having narrowly survived the campaign of 1941 without appreciablehelp from the outside, she is entitled to rely on her Allies now for that measure of aid which the desperate gravity of situation on the southern front demands.Some people here, particularly Red Army men, are now definitely bitterabout the tardiness of the Second Front. There are some who believe, and say,that Britain and America still want to see Russia further weakened and crippledbefore they come in with their great strength. Others are critical of Britain&apos;sreluctance to make a move until the outcome is 100 per cent, certain. They feelthat their own position is so serious that some risk is justified. They feel that britain is preserving the lives of her own soldiers at the expense of Russia.Though officially maintaining an absolutely correct attitude and though officialpropaganda is all friendly, it would be untrue to say that, at this moment,Russians have such affection, or indeed respect, for Britain. The atmospherehere is strained and difficult. Any lengthy postponement of a Second Frontwould, in my view, have a truly deplorable long-term effect on Anglo-soviet relations. Nothing would be so likely to imperil a sound peace as the general feeling here that Russia had fought the war and that Britain and America had done the mopping up. Naturally, I do not necessarily associate myself with allow views I am merely reporting the Soviet attitude.11816   [24192]Copy No.
Particularly irritating to the Russians at the present time is the talk from britain about the tremendous supplies which have been sent to Russia and here,at least, I fully share their feeling.It is one thing to say that Britain has done everything possible to getmaterial here, that she has suffered big losses at sea in doing so, and that she has deprived her own fronts of much needed supplies. That is all true. Butto imply or pretend that the aid rendered to Russia has been anything like a major factor in Russian resistance is simply stupid. British tanks and aeroplanes,though very welcome, are just a drop in the bucket, and every Russian knowsthis. Even more exasperating are speeches by British statesmen telling how fastour production is growing and how strong we are now. Naturally, the retort here is :&quot;Well, if you are as strong as all that, why don&apos;t you-start a Second Front?&quot;I should like to emphasise that all publicity on the subject here is very correctand there is absolutely no suggestion that Russia- is being badly let down.
