THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1942.MOST SECRET. ,   Copy No.   18W.P. (42) 350.August 10, 1942.TO, JBE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.Tt is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.MADAGASCAR-FUTURE POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on Chiefs of staff report (C.O.S. (42) 221 (0)) of the 6th August (W.P. (42) 345).ON political grounds I see no reason to object to the proposed operation. Theloss of the whole of Madagascar has probably been already discounted by the vichy government, who did not expect that our occupation would be confined to DiegoSuarez and its immediate vicinity. It is unlikely that the Vichy Governmentwould react more vigorously than they did in the case of the Diego Suarezoperation. Laval might try to use our action as a pretext for making further concessions to the Germans, but he could always find one pretext or another for doing so, and I consider that his possible reactions need not deter us. If theoperations are conducted quickly and vigorously the risk of an adverse reactionby the Vichy Government is less. If, on the other hand, the operations drag on,the effect would be bad, since the Vichy Government would be under constant pressure from the Germans to react.2. The Chiefs of Staff rightly mention (Annex I, paragraph 10) theinterest of the United States in obtaining supplies of mica and graphite. Thisis an important argument in favour of the operation. Since the United StatesGovernment have already informed us more than once of this interest, and sincethe United States Governments communication to Vichy at the beginning ofour operations at Diego Suarez was most helpful, it is desirable that the UnitedStates Government should be informed in advance of the operation. I suggestthat this would most appropriately be done through the Joint Staff Mission.3. In accordance with the undertaking which His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave given, the Fighting French should, as soon as possible after the capitulation,be given their due share in the administration. This should be borne in mindwhen the terms of surrender are drawn. The detailed arrangements for their participation in the administration could subsequently be discussed with general de Gaulle&apos;s Headquarters in London and with Colonel Pechkoff, the Free french representative in the Union of South Africa, who, as recommended by GeneralPlatt, should visit the island after the acceptance of the terms of surrender.4. It would be advisable that the conditions of surrender dealing with political matters should be discussed in advance between the Foreign Office andthe Service Departments, so that guidance can be given to the Force Commander.5. In any event, it is important that the terms of surrender should includeno promise of unconditional repatriation of the French forces in the island. we require them as a lever to get back our men whom Vichy hold.6. I would suggest that, in General de Gaulle&apos;s absence, the acting Presidentof the French National Committee should be informed a few hours in advanceof the actual operation. This would enable him to tranquillise the Free french representatives abroad once the news of the operations had become public.A. E.Foreign Office, August 10, 1942.11821   [24213]
