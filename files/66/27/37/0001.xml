Bakuhas 8,000 wells, but it is expected that all refineries and flowing wells wouldhe destroyed and equipment for obtaining oil from pumping wells removed or destroyed.Grozny is a declining field and limitations of skilled personnel andequipment will deter the Germans from reconstructing it as long as they expect to reach the much more valuable fields of Baku.-    Assuming Grozny occupied one month, and Baku four months after Maikop, the following are the maximum quantitiethe Germans can hope to obtain:From Prom Maikop   From MaikopMaikop      and Grozny     and Bakutons tons jtqnsWithin three months after occupationof Maikop 30,000 30,00C 30,000Within six months after occupationof Maikop 270,000        390,000.      270,000- Within twelve months after occupation ___of Maikop &apos; 1,240,000     2,030,000     2,290,000    .The annual rate of production at the end of twelve months will be:Maikop 2,300,000, Maikop and Grozny 4,000,000, Maikop and Baku 6,300,000.The/
Tho bulk of Caucasus oil would have to be refined elsewhere for twoyears until suitable rofine-irLos could be re-croctod. For this purpose,four million tons auryltis capo.city is available in Roumania,Large-scale transport to Germany by rail will be out of the questionso long as active fighting continues in South Russia.     To carry fourmillion tons of crude from Caucasus to roumania by sea the Axis willrequire to move into the Black Boa from the Lloditerranean 170,000 G-.R.T.of tankers.     Of this 120,000 is available from their own resources inthe Mediterranean;   the balance could bo obtained from Vichy.
