August 1942.Copy No./WAR CABINET.RECONSTRUCTION PROBLEMS.Progress Report by the Paymaster-General.THE work on reconstruction problems now being carried out by the various departments of State is being organised and co-ordinated by the Reconstruction.Problems Committee and a series of subsidiarv committees. Two of these committees are of a general character, dealing respectively with Internal and external Economic Problems, and are comprised of the heads or deputy heads ofthe Departments principally concerned; the remainder are concerned withparticular problems or small groups of interrelated problems. A summary ofthe latter, with an indication of the progress made on each, is given in thefootnote.*2. In addition to this inter-departmental machinery for co-ordinating thework on general or related problems, each Department is, of course, giving studyto its own special problems, often with the aid of departmental committees.Direct assistance is also being rendered by a number of outside organisations and individuals, such as the Nuffield College Social Reconstruction Survey, the ForeignResearch and Press Service and Professors Pigou of Cambridge and Tawney ofOxford, and full use is being made of the reports that are being produced fromtime to time by societies and associations, trade and otherwise, private studygroups, &amp;c.3.

2machinery of Central Planning, and the position of Part III EducationAuthorities, under the Education Act, 1902. Two recent extensions of the recon-struction organisation have been (a) The constitution (under War Cabinet direction) of a military section(comprising representatives of all three Services) to carry out prepara-tory studies in regard to Armistice conditions and cognate problems.(b) The appointment of an Advisory Council on Welsh reconstruction problems.4. The work of the Committee on External Economic Problems has hithertocentred on the coming Anglo-American negotiations. Under its aegis a compre-hensive memorandum has been prepared by the Treasury on External monetary and Economic Policy, submitting proposals for the establishment of a ClearingUnion (R.P. (42) 2). The Committee is now giving consideration to a plan forthe International Regulation of Primary Products and to the agenda for the expected informal discussions with the Americans on international trade and finance.5. The corresponding Committee on Internal Economic Problems covers a very wide field; in Appendix I is given a list of memoranda which either havebeen, or are being, prepared, by Departments for the Committee. The Committeehas just submitted the attached &quot; Interim Report on the Internal economic problems of the Post-War Transitional Period (appending to it a treasury memorandum on the Post-War Relation between Purchasing Power and consumers&apos; Goods) &quot;* (Appendix IT).6. After a forecast of conditions of supply and demand in the years immediately following the war, the opinion is expressed that &quot; most of the elements of a sharp restocking boom will be latent in the situation &apos;&apos; and that thethree outstanding tasks will be (ij the restoration of the &apos;&apos; balance of payments &apos;&apos;;(ii) the restraint of inflation:(iii) the transfer of resources in labour and materials from war- to peace-time employment.7.   The conclusions of the Report are summarised as follows :- (a) that the rehabilitation of export must be regarded as one of&quot; the primeobjectives of post-war policy;(b) that every effort must be made to continue the stabilisation policy;(cj that, for a time, consumer rationing must be maintained;(a) that such commodity controls as may be necessary must be continued;(e) that, in order to promote the transfer of resources, recourse must be hadto the mechanism of allocation of materials;(/). that special attention must be given to arrangements (which may have tobe of a regulative character) for promoting labour mobility;(g) that&apos; suitable opportunities should be taken to prepare the public forrestraints and sacrifices that may be entailed during the transition period, if the more distant objectives of economic welfare are to be attained.8.   On a more extended view the Committee state : &apos;&apos; But the acute shortages of the transitional period will not last forever. As the channels of trade reopen and resources are transferred, so^gradually something more like equilibrium should be established. Thereafterthere should be hopeful possibilities not only of restoring, but also of pro-gressively raising, our standards of living. For there is no reason to doubtthat technical progress after the war, as in past years, will enable realproduction to be steadily increased. Indeed, the war will in many ways havespeeded up the process of technical invention and discovery, and may thusindirectly make possible a more rapid development of technique in certaincivilian industries and occupations. There is, of course, much to be tdone tomake good war damage to houses, to productive equipment and to other forms of capital; but this process should not take longer than a few years;* Circulated as E.P. (42) 21.
thereafter, if industrial activity can be maintained, it should be possibleyear by year to increase and to improve the community&apos;s capital equipment,and thereby progressivly raise the national income. A larger proportion ofthis income than before the war will be required to buy the food and rawmaterials that we need from overseas, and we shall therefore have to raiseour total production appreciably above the pre-war level before we canimprove on our pre-war standards of consumption. But there is no reasonto doubt our ability to do this and to do it within a comparatively short time.The early prospect is arduous, but the distant vistas offer greatopportunities.&quot;9. The Report &quot; makes no claim to be an exhaustive treatment even of the subjects with which it deals, and there have been deliberately omitted from itsrange a number of problems which will be of great importance, even in the transition period, e.g., the problem of deconcentration, disposal of stocks, controlof the capital market, and the improvement of industrial efficiency. On all these and other matters further papers are in active preparation.&quot;The Committee propose to proceed with their work 1&apos; on the assumption notonly that the policy of stabilisation should be continued as far as possible duringthe transitional period, but also that the preservation of a high and stable levelof economic activity and of employment in subsequent years should be set in the forefront of our economic objectives.&quot;10. The Reconstruction Problems Committee approve this Report generally and submit it to the War Cabinet for approval. They would suggest that it beadopted as the general background against which other reconstruction problemsshould be considered.  .(Initialled) W. A. J.4 Richmond Terrace, S.

Interim Report of the Committee on :&quot;The Internal Economic Problems of the Post-War transitional period.&quot;II. Memorandum prepared by the Treasury on :&quot; The Post-War Relation between Purchasing Power and consumer goods.&quot;Covering Note.THE Interim Report of the Committee is submitted in fulfilment of theundertaking given in its Progress Report of the 16th May, 1942 (R.P. (42) 11),to prepare a survey on &quot; the major features of the general economic position inthe years immediately after the war.&quot; It is, therefore, confined to the post-wartransitional period, only touching on the immediate post-armistice problems andthe longer-run problems of reconstruction in so far as these are relevant to theconsideration of the transitional period.2. In considering this transitional period, the most important question is whether it will be a period of short supplies and of high demand for civiliangoods (such as we are experiencing during the war), or of deficient demand andof relatively abundant supplies (such as have characterised periods of general trade depression in the past). The Memorandum by the Treasury is devoted tothis question. After the last war, there was an inflationary period of excessdemand and of short supplies, and many reasons are given in the Treasurydocument for believing that this war will be followed by a similar period ofshortages and of threatened inflation, but of longer duration. The return of menfrom the armed forces to civil production will probably not be so rapid as afterthe last war; physical destruction (and the consequent need for replacement)of capital assets will be much greater; the restriction on the production and thepurchase of civilian goods during this war has been more severe; there will be agreater volume of accumulated purchasing power ready for expenditure in civilianmarkets; the process of correcting our balance of payments, whether by restrictingimports or by increasing our exports, will exercise a greater influence in curtailingsupplies on the home market; and, as a result of war developments, shortages inother parts of the world are likely to be more marked than after the war of1914-18.3. The Interim Report of the Official Committee has therefore been preparedupon the assumption that during the post-war transitional period shortages of civilian&apos;supplies and an excess of consumers&apos; purchasing power will persist for aconsiderable time. Part I of the Report analyses the situation on this basis, andthe conclusion is reached that the outstanding tasks of the transitional period will be (a) to restore the balance of payments;\b) to restrain inflation; and(c) to promote the transfer of resources and, in particular, of labour, -from war to peace-time employment.
4. In Part II the action necessary in various fields to achieve each of these three objectives is discussed in turn, while Part III deals very briefly with the bearing that such action will have on some of the long-term problems of reconstruction.5.   The conclusions of the Report are summarised as follows : (a) That the rehabilitation of export must be regarded as one of the primeobjectives of post-war policy.(6) That every effort must&quot; be made to continue the stabilisation policy.(c) That, for a time, consumer rationing must be maintained.(d) That such, commodity controls as may be necessary must be continued.(e) That in order to promote the transfer of resources, recourse must be hadto the mechanism of allocation of materials.(/) That special attention must be given to arrangements (which may haveto be of a regulative character) for promoting labour mobility.(g) That suitable opportunities should be taken to prepare the public forrestraints and sacrifices that may be entailed during the transition period, if the more distant objectives of economic welfare are to be attained.6. The Committee proposes to proceed with its work &quot; on the assumption,not only that the policy of stabilisation should be continued as far as possibleduring the transitional period, but also that the preservation of a high and stable level of economic activity and of employment in subsequent years should be set in the forefront of our economic objectives.&quot;(Signed on behalf of the Official Committee),A.

IOFFICIAL COMMITTEE ON INTERNAL ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.Interim Report on the Internal Economic Problems of the Post-WarTransitional Period.Introduction.1. The object of this report is to present a broad survey of some of the salient economic problems with which this country will be confronted in the years immediately following the war, and of the deductions bearing on future policy,to be drawn therefrom, which we propose to adopt as the basis of future reports.The report is essentially preparatory in character. Separate memoranda of amore detailed character will be submitted, on each of the main problems dealt with,and as the study thus proceeds, the Committee may introduce some differences of emphasis or method of presentation. To that extent, therefore, the conclusions should be regarded as provisional.2. To get a clear perspective of the nature of these problems, a threefold,classification is convenient: (a) There are the problems which will arise immediately hostilities come toan end.. (b) There are the problems which will arise because of the peculiar difficultiesof the transition from war to peace.(c) There are more fundamental problems concerning the objectives to be aimed at in the more distant future when these immediate difficulties are at an end.3. The first class of problem the problems of the morrow of the armistice are for the most part problems of a highly technical nature, e.g., demobilisation,liquidation of war contracts, &amp;c, and. fall largely within the province of thedepartments which will be most immediately concerned. They are, therefore,most conveniently dealt with in a series of separate memoranda, the preparationof which is already well in hand.4. Nevertheless, the nature of the measures which are to be put intooperation at this point must necessarily depend in some degree upon the view which is taken of the conditions likely to prevail in the years immediately following. If it be thought,, for example, that the years following the end of thewar are likely to be years of economic depression, the demobilisation^plan mightdiffer widely from that which would be thought appropriate if conditions of active trade were to be regarded, as more j probable. Preliminary study suggeststhat the conditions prevailing during these years will be of a highly novel andintricate character, presenting difficulties without precedent; yet the problems which emerge are problems to which solutions must be found if we are to move forward without grave dislocation. It has, therefore, been thought desirableto devote this interim report chiefly to a study of the problems of this, transitional,period and the formulation of broad outlines of possible solutions.5. Just as the solution of the problems of the armistice depends partly onthe view taken of the problems of the transitional period, so solution of theproblems of the transitional period will depend partly upon the view taken ofmore distant objectives. This is a matter necessarily involving political issuesupon which, at this stage, Ministers may not wish to make final pronouncement.This report, therefore, makes no attempt to go deeply into these questions. Butin a final section it has been thought desirable to set forth the way in which someof the transitional problems are related to the problems of the longer period, andto set forth explicitly in paragraph 59 one of the main assumptions concerningultimate objectives upon which the work of the Committee is being based. *
Part I. The General Nature of the Problem.6. The main economic problem during the war has been to transfer resources from use for unessential civilian purposes to use for the armed forces or for theproduction of munitions and other essential goods and services. The extent towhich this mobilisation of resources has proceeded is illustrated by the followingestimates of national expenditure (taken from Cmd. 6347) :-Personal expenditure on con-sumption at cost of produc-tionExpenditure on goods and services by public authori-tiesPrivate net investment athome (including war lossesmade good)Net investment abroad3,584833406- 551941.&amp; millions.3,863Changebetween1938 and1941.4- 2794,182      -r 3,349- 493- 798- 899- 743Total National Income^)      4,7686,7541,986Between 1938 and 1941, Government demand for goods and services rose by no less than  3,349 millions. In the same period personal expenditure rose byconsiderably less than the increase in the costs of goods and services for con-sumption, so that an appreciable decline (estimated at some 15 to 20 per cent.)in real consumption had in fact taken place. At the same time the annualprivate investment at home fell by.  899 millions; for private enterprise isrefraining from many capital extensions and is not fully replacing its fixed or working capital. The rate of decline of overseas assets also became more rapidby some  743 millions a year, the community being enabled, by living on itsforeign assets or by borrowing from abroad, to import far more than it exported.7. The oustanding problem of the post-war transition will be to reverse all this, to transfer labour and other economic resources as smoothly as possible backto peace-time uses, to revive exports and the industries making for domestic consumption. This transition cannot, however, be smoothly carried out unlessany great inflation or deflation of national income is avoided, and this is a problem of great delicacy. For if it is to be solved satisfactorily it is necessarythat the rate of increase in other expenditure, including the overseas demand forour goods, should be properly related to the rate of decline in government expenditure. At a time when there will be much purchasing power, accumulatedduring the war, anxious to find an outlet, this will not be easy to bring about.Furthermore, as a result of the using up of capital assets abroad, we shall be facedwith a severe deficit of the balance of payments which will have to be remediedif there is not to be a severe exchange crisis.8. The ease with which this transition can be carried out will be affectedby the way in which the war ends. If hostilities should, for example, continue inthe Far East after they have been ended in Europe, the transition itself wouldbe more gradual. For in this case certain warlike activities would be diminished in intensity before the final conclusion of all hostilities, and thepreliminary stages of economic and financial demobilisation would be carried outin a psychological atmosphere in which it would be easier to maintain theessential Governmental controls.9. Indeed, it goes without saying that many post-war economic problemsmust remain uncertain until it is clearer what will be the future course of eventsdaring the war, and when the war is likely to end. The post-war shippino-situation will constitute one of the most decisive factors in our economic position :whether the war ends with the present scarcity of importing capacity or whether,Includes war risks insurance premiums and indirect taxes and rates- other than thosespecifically on consumption.[24189] &apos;   c
before the end of the war, American shipbuilding will have greatly eased thesituation, is still a matter for speculation. Nevertheless, there are certain broadgeneralisations which may already be made.10. For some time after this war, as after the war of 1914-18, there islikely to be a marked excess of demand over supplies for the majority of peace-time goods and services. Indeed, as is shown - in much greater detail in a document prepared by the Treasury and submitted with this report, there is reason to believe that these inflationary tendencies will be more potent and lastlonger than after the last war. This may be best seen if demand is analysedunder separate headings. *Demand for Goods in the Transitional Period.(a) Expenditure by Public Authorities.11. If, as seems very probable, it should be necessary for this country after this war to retain for a time substantially larger armed Forces than after the last war, Government demands for military goods and services will continue at a high level. In addition very heavy expenditure frOm public funds will be necessaryfor physical reconstruction. .(b) Demand for Goods and Services for Personal Consumption.12. During this war consumers&apos; demands have been restricted with greater severity than during the last war. This has had a double effect. In thefirst place, consumers, being unable to buy their normal supplies of manycommodities, have saved large amounts of money; and these sums, together withdeferred credits under the income-tax, will be available for post-war expenditure.In the second place, people will wish to renew stocks of clothing, furniture, house-hold equipment, motor cars and similar goods of which they have been starvedduring the war.(c) Home Investment.13. In the period after the war there will be a high demand for capital goods to re-equip and restock civilian industry and commerce. To some extent the State, by a careful timing and adaptation of the disposal or use of Government-owned factories, machine tools and stocks, may be able to meet the specialtransitional demands of business for capital equipment without involving ademand for new production, but these Government-owned resources will not all be suitable for peace-time demands. The post-war demand for capital goods willbe very great: war damage to property will have to be made good, civilianindustry re-equipped and arrears of demand for houses and business premisesof all kinds will have accumulated; many of these demands will be urgent.(d) The Balance of Foreign Payments.14. There is a further factor which will add to the pressure of monetarydemand. As suggested above, at the close of the war there will be a seriousdisequilibrium in our balance of payments with other countries. Whateverfinancial methods are adopted to rectify this, it will be necessary to expand thevolume of our export trade. This will represent an additional demand for goods and services in this country.15. All these considerations suggest that most of the elements of a sharprestocking boom will be latent in the situation.Scarcities of Supplies in the Transitional Period.16. On the other hand, many civilian goods and services will be in short supply. The stocks in this country of most imported materials and foodstuffswill by the end of the war have been pared down to fine margins and, unless thewar lasts long enough for American shipbuilding to have replaced a great dealof the tonnage that has been sunk, replenishment will be slow. Of special importance will be the scarcity of certain raw materials such as timber and rubber,vital for reconstruction, materials of which the post-war rate of production over-seas&apos;may for a time be below the pre-war level. Shortages here will delay recovery
Part II.22.. The preceding analysis suggests three outstanding tasks : (i) The restoration of the balance of payments,(ii) The restraint of inflation,(iii) The transfer of resources.The problems involved in the fulfilment of these tasks are discussed in the sections which follow.(i) Restoration of the. Balance of Payments.23. It is commonly agreed that one of our major tasks in the period immediately following the war will be to wipe out the heavy deficit in the balanceof payments. If we cannot do this the whole fabric of reconstruction is in dangerand we run the risk of a failure to maintain essential imports&apos; and of a majorinternal inflation.[24189] c in other fields. As regards imported foodstuffs, special difficulty may be expected from the shortage of refrigerated tonnage, which will affect the supply of suchfoodstuffs as meat, butter, eggs and fruit.17. The production in this country of some civilian goods and services willbe restricted for want of adequate supplies of special types of skilled labour.Much labour will need to be retained, much transferred geographically, before it is suitable for employment in expanding peace-time industries. Some factorieshave been closed down, their machinery moved and their premises used for storageor for housing other firms engaged on war production. It will take time to clearthem and fit them out again, with the proper machinery.18. An outstanding example of an industry in which abnormally high levelof demand will be combined with continuing scarcities of supply is afforded by- Building. Reference has already been made to the unsatisfied demand that ispiling up during the war. Meanwhile the labour force in the building industry will have been seriously contracted and will need to be increased very rapidly ifthe urgent needs of reconstruction are to be met. Certain types of skilled labourand certain building materials, in particular timber, are likely to be in seriouslyshort supply.Bottlenecks and Unemployment in the Transitional Period.19. These scarcities of many peace-time goods and services will be combined with an excess of resources in a number of war-time occupations. Certain rawmaterials such as aluminium, certain forms of capital equipment such as machine tools, and certain types .of labour such as. skilled engineering labour, will be inexcessive supply.20. Unless special measures are taken, this lack of balance will lead to unemployment. Labour demobilised from the armed forces and from munitions production must be appropriately retrained and transferred to the appropriatelocalities. The reabsorption of demobilised labour will be held up unless it ispossible to break down the &quot; bottlenecks,&quot; which are found to be holding up theexpansion of particular kinds of civilian production.21. Such a situation will, however, differ fundamentally from that whichnormally obtains at a time of general unemployment. Then activity in the greatmajority of trades is slack and it is appropriate to give employment byexpansionist financial measures which stimulate the demand for all goods and services. Such measures will be quite inappropriate in the post-war transitional period, with an already existing excess of demand over supply in a large range of eivilian occupations. In such circumstances, only the rapid retraining and transfer of those types of labour which are needed and careful control of the useof &quot;bottleneck&quot; raw materials (such as timber in building or rubber in motormanufacture), coupled with measures for the speedy re-tooling of industry for peace-time purposes, will secure the rapid absorption of the labour displacedfrom war industries.
24. The main methods for meeting this situation, on the external side, havealready been set forth in another document (R.P. (42) 2). But whatever inter-national methods are adopted, important effects on our internal arrangements are necessarily involved.25. It is improbable, that at least for some time after the war, we shall beable to dispense with limitations on imports. Even after the shortage of shipping has disappeared it will be necessary to maintain restrictions on imports untilother methods have been developed for the adjustment of the balance of. payments.26. But restrictions on imports cannot be the major instrument of equilibra-tion. The chief imports of this country are foodstuffs and raw materials, bothessential to the standard of&apos; living; we must, therefore, rely in the main upon an expansion of exports.27. In the early stages, at least, of this transition period the demand forour goods in overseas markets will be greater than we can satisfy. There willbe no occasion to force our exports on those markets. Rather shall we have todecide which of the various markets to serve first. It will, of course, be of theutmost importance that we shall re-establish our trade connections in this period.28. The subsequent expansion of exports, however, will require extra-ordinary measures. Raw materials will still be short. If all claimants on their usewere to be allowed to participate in a general scramble, the rehabilitation of theexport industries might be indefinitely delayed. If only with a view to securingadequate allocation for export, the retention of raw material control seemsessential.29. But this has a further implication. If export is to have priority, it follows that, for the time being at least, other things must go short. Certainforms of civilian supplies, especially textiles, will be short, and, if distributionis not to -be disorderly, this means some prolongation of rationing of consumption.-30. At the same time, it is a matter for consideration how far the existing machinery for labour control and any special arrangements which may be devisedin connection with demobilisation could be utilised to give priority in restoringlabour supplies to the export industries. Some help might also be given to exportsduring this period by meeting part of the demand in the home market by therelease of Government-owned surplus stocks of manufactured goods (such as motor vehicles), leaving the newly-produced supplies to be exported.(ii) The Restraint of Inflation.31. It has been suggested above that the period immediately after the waris likely to be marked by an excess of money demand over supply, and thepersistence of shortages. If the various controls which have been imposed duringthe war were immediately to be relaxed, there would be danger of grave inflation.The Policy of Price Stabilisation.32. The first question, therefore, which arises is whether the policy of price stabilisation is to be continued. It would doubtless be premature to decide now that any rigid level of prices was to be maintained, for there will be all sorts of forces operating at that time which may well compel some revision of our ideas,but some decision is essential on the general question whether to continue thepolicy of stabilising the cost of living and the prices of&apos;goods in common use.33. The policy of stabilisation involves the maintenance of maximum prices for a large range of raw materials and foodstuffs, at least as long as the periodof excess of demand over supplies continues. This policy of price control will in turn necessitate the continuance into the transitional period of the controls overraw materials and basic foodstuffs. The possibility of maintaining this policy,however, rests primarily on three factors r (a) The continuation of a moderate wages policy which will not lead to sucha rise in wage costs as to cause an ever-increasing disequilibriumbetween costs and controlled prices;(b) A decision to continue, if necessary, the policy of subsidising the cost ofliving;
(c) External conditions which do not cause the price of imported supplies ofraw materials and foodstuffs to rise excessively against us.34. It is impossible to foretell how high a level of subsidies the main-tenance of the stabilisation policy may entail. In the transitional period costs are likely to fall; war risks insurance on imported cargoes and on commoditystocks will presumably disappear: for a number of reasons, such as the absenceof blackout difficulties and the replacement of less efficient temporary labour, theefficiency of production is likely to increase; without any decline in the levelof wage-rates, wage costs will be reduced if less overtime is worked, and thenormal long-term improvement ot&quot; technique is likely to continue and may bespeeded up as a result of war developments. Indeed, these&apos;reductions in costmight be sufficient to enable the stabilisation policy to be continued without anysubsidies from the Exchequer; but it would be too sanguine to rely upon any suchearly development. It is at present unknown what level of subsidies it will bedecided to pay to British agriculture; but it is unlikely that they will totallydisappear. There is also a danger that world prices of some materials and food-stuffs will rise, though such a tendency might be checked by a continuance duringthe transitional period of present arrangements for co-ordinated buying andco-ordinated use of shipping by the United Nations.35. The continuation of the policy of stabilisation does not necessarily involved the stabilisation of every particular price. At the end of the war theprices of manufactured goods (e.g., clothing) are likely to be abnormally high inrelation to the prices of other goods (such as certain controlled food-stuffs). Itwill probably prove desirable to maintain a stability of the general cost of living-index by allowing certain prices to rise as the cost and prices of other goods arereduced.36. It is also a matter for consideration whether the production of&quot;utility&quot; goods, such as &quot;utility&quot; clothing, should not be continued into the transitional period. Such a policy would help to keep prices from rising andwould enable accumulated shortages of goods, such as clothes and furniture, tobe met as efficiently and as speedily as possible.The Control of Demand.37. If the policy of price stabilisation is to continue, certain other measures are also necessary. It is not enough to fix prices : it is necessary also to controldemand.   This principle has various applications.(a) The restriction of money demand.38. During the war the general level of demand has been held in checkby high levels of direct and indirect taxation and also by the influence exertedby the National Savings campaign. Direct taxation has greatly restricted thespendable incomes of the rich, and has now been extended so as to affect the incomes of a large number of wage-earners. Heavy indirect taxes have not onlydamped down the demand for the goods and services directly taxed, but have withdrawn in taxation large sums of money which might otherwise have been available for expenditure on other objects. If prices are to be kept stable duringthe period of inflated demand and short supplies, taxation should be maintained at a high level; and it will also be important to secure a continuance of large scale voluntary savings, by the public.39. A similar principle might be observed in the repayment of deferredincome tax credits. If these sums are withheld during the period of generalscarcity, and are released as abundant supplies appear on the market, they will contribute to the stabilisation of the general conditions of supply and demand.(b) Rationing.40. But the restriction of money demanded in general will not alone be enough, at any rate during the opening stages of the transition. It will almost certainly be necessary in certain cases to maintain more direct control of consump-tion. Both for the reasons mentioned above in connection with the problem of the rehabilitation of exports and in order to maintain equitable distribution, it will benecessary that, for some time, certain rationing schemes should be continued.
41. This conclusion is reinforced by the consideration that some prolongation-tion of rationing will be necessary to facilitate the provision of relief to continental Europe. - .42. Such a policy would not involve an indefinite commitment to this formof regulation. As supplies increased so rations could be enlarged until the point was reached at which supply was once more equal to demand and rationing couldbe abolished altogether. What is important is that if the general principle ofstabilisation is to be adopted the public should be educated to realise that somecontinuance of existing control is necessary.(c) The allocation of materials.43. Direct control of consumption, however, is not in all cases the most appropriate instrument for restricting, demand. In many cases (e.g., timber)the most effective instrument at present for the restriction of civilian demand isthat of allocation by the appropriate Eaw Material Control, and it will probablybe impossible to maintain an orderly development during the transitional periodunless the Controls are themselves continued. These Controls will be needed tomake allocations of the scarce materials among the various civilian uses accordingto their relative urgency.44. Such peace-time allocation of raw materials will, however, raise certaindifficult problems. In war-time all activities are directed as far as possible toone specific aim the development of the greatest possible war effort, but in peace-time there are a multitude of economic objectives; and it is difficult, if not impossible, to reduce all these to a common measure for the purpose of priorities.In many cases it may prove necessary to distinguish only between a few broadgroups such as the export trade, &apos;&apos; utility &apos;&apos; goods, and other home marketgoods but generally the problem of the later sub-division of supplies within thesebroad groups will require careful attention. And there will be the difficulty ofproviding for allocations not only to existing firms, but also to new businesseswhich may be established after the war. Even though raw materials are scarce,new firms must be allowed to start in order to be ready for the time when outputmust expand. Men and firms returning from war service must not find everyavenue to enterprise blocked.(d) Limitation of Supplies.45. Finally, it must be noted that there are at present in existence a seriesof controls which restrict consumption by direct operation on the output of manufactured products in particular, the direction of production operated bythe. Board of Trade. Clearly, the main object of policy after the war must be toremove limitation of supply as soon as possible, but in so far as these regulationspermit a control of demand for scarce materials or manufacturing capacity,any measures for their relaxation must be carefully co-ordinated with general (stabilisation policy. Reference has already been made in paragraph 13 to thedemand for capital goods which will arise after the war. It is presumed thatto the extent that our physical resources allow such capital demand to be met,funds will be made available, although there will be serious technical problems tobe solved if this is to be done without impairment of the gilt-edged market.(iii) The Transfer of Economic Resources.46. The foregoing discussion has been concerned with measures which wouldbe consequential on any decision to continue the stabilisation policy. Butstabilisation is not an end in itself. The prime objective of policy, as already stated, must be to transfer resources from the service of war to the service ofpeace; and. indeed, it must be recognised that to some extent the two aims arein conflict. For there can be no doubt that the release of pent-up money demand at the end of the war will work in a way to promote transfer. The high demandfor the products of peace-time industry led to an uncontrolled boom in pricesafter the last war, but it also eased the absorption of demobilised men. If now we attempt to bring about the transition without such a price-boom and all thatfollowed in its train, we must be careful to provide mechanisms which will takethe place of these drastic influences.
47. To do this, it will be necessary to take special measures to break downbottlenecks. The limiting factors on the expansion of demand in peace, as inwar, will almost certainly prove to be the shortage of certain plant, certain keyproducts and certain types of labour. Some use of the method of priorities, both for materials and for labour, will be essential if these obstructions are to berapidly overcome. For example, in connection with the demobilisation plan,attention should be given to arrangements for the early release of men whosespecial skill can provide the speedy rehabilitation of branches of industry havingthis pivotal position in relation to the whole economy.48. The need for geographical and occupational transfer of labour will notbe confined to the immediate post-war period. Experience between the two warshas shown how structural changes in demand, in productive technique, or in the channels of trade, may leave persistent pockets of &quot; special1 unemployment.No doubt similar structural changes will be found to result from the present war and to occur in the more distant future. - And the need for definiteGovernment action to bring about the transfer of labour in order to absorb suchunemployment will be increased by certain long-term trends in the population.As a result of the serious decline in the birth-rate over the last few decades, ourworking population is coming -to consist of a higher and higher proportion of older workers, and, after a few more years, the total working population will begin to decline : no action that can now be taken can have any appreciablebearing on either trend for, at any rate, the next fifteen years. Old workers are naturally less mobile than the young and, moreover, the less rapidly a populationexpands, the more difficult it becomes to adjust labour supplies between decliningand expanding industries by concentrating the entry of juveniles into expandingindustries. For this reason it is probable that the actual transfer of older workers from one occupation or region to another will become more and more necessary.49. It is obviously desirable that action taken during the transitional period to promote the mobility of labour should.be framed with reference to this long-termneed. Considerable experience has already been gained in the inter-war periodof the geographical as well as the occupational difficulties involved. the prevalence of unemployment during this period in certain heavy industries largelyconcentrated in particular areas in the North and West, while the developmentof new industries was taking place in the South-East, raised many acute problems,and it has been suggested that Government action should be taken to secure abetter distribution of the industrial population in future. Such proposals raisewide and important issues going beyond the scope of this report, but their bearing on the problem of the mobility of labour is obvious.50. A better distribution of industry will do much to ease the geographicaldifficulties, but it will in no way reduce the need of extensive provision forretraining of the unemployed in new occupations. Great importance will nodoubt be attached to this matter in the review of the schemes of social insurance and allied services now taking place.Part III. Long-Run Problems.51. The earlier paragraphs of this paper have given reason for believing that .a continuation of many of the discomforts of the war -economy will be inevitable during the transitional period. As long as serious shortages of consumers&apos; goods persist; certain war-time restrictions and controls must be main-tained if an orderly development of economic life is to be achieved.52. But the acute shortages of the transitional period will not last for ever.As the channels of trade reopen and resources are transferred, so gradually some-thing more like equilibrium should be established. Thereafter there should behopeful possibilities not only of restoring, but also of progressively raising, ourstandards of living.. For there is no reason to doubt that technical progress afterthe war, as in past years, will enable real production to be steadily increased.Indeed, the war will in many ways have speeded up the process of technicalinvention and discovery, and may thus indirectly make possible a more rapid development of technique in certain civilian industries and occupations. Thereis, of course, much to be done to make good war-damage to houses, to productiveequipment and to other forms of capital; but this process should not take longer
than a few years; thereafter, if industrial activity can be maintained, it shouldbe possible year by year to increase and to improve the community&apos;s capital equipment, and thereby progressively raise the national income. A larger pro-portion of this income than before the war will be required to buy the food andraw materials that we need from overseas, and-we shall therefore have to raiseour total production appreciably above the pre-war level before we can improveon our pre-war standards of consumption. But there is no reason to doubt our ability to do this and to do it within a comparatively short time. The earlyprospect is arduous, but the distant vistas offer great opportunities.53. These long-term possibilities will, however, partly depend on the policywhich is adopted during the transitional period, and partly on factors which donot lie wholly within our control. In the first place, we must solve the difficult problem of our balance of payments so that we are able to obtain from abroad on not too onerous terms the food and raw materials upon which our prosperitymust continue to be based. The solution of this problem depends mainly uponexternal conditions and international arrangements which have already beendiscussed at length in R.P. (42) 2. But this problem will not be satisfactorilysolved unless during the transitional period internal measures are also taken to restore and .to expand our export trade, even though these measures entail the continuation of restrictions in the home market.54. It has already been observed (paragraphs 46 to 50) that one of the main problems of the transitional period will be to transfer economic resources fromthe contracting occupations of war-time to the expanding occupations of peace.Unless this transfer can be smoothly carried out, it will be impossible effectively to remove the shortages which will exist in the transitional period; and, unlesssufficient transferability of resources is maintained thereafter, it will beimpossible to take full advantage of technical progress to raise standards of living in subsequent years.55. In a similar manner, the successful continuation of the policy of stabilisation-sation during the transitional period would aid the maintenance of stability and prosperity in subsequent years. After the last war an uncontrolled restockingboom was followed by a severe economic depression; and, although the sharpburst of economic activity and of rising prices which occurred at that time may-have somewhat facilitated the process of demobilisation, it greatly complicatedthe problem of maintaining a stable level of economic progress in subsequent years. In the later years of reconstruction after this war it is essential to preventeconomic depressions and the widespread wastes of economic resources in idlenessand unemployment, which are the normal accompaniments of such depressions.In fact, all the solid improvements in standards of living which we may hope to achieve after the transitional period are dependent upon the successful avoidance of large-scale unemployment; and the restraint necessary for the maintenanceof stabilisation during the transitional period will be well worth while if for noother reason than that it should facilitate the maintenance of stability in subsequent years.56. During the transitional period of shortages the policy of stabilisationwill require a continuation of price controls and of restraints on civilianpurchases. But this period of shortages will pass and the continuation of thepolicy of stabilisation will then, from time to time, require the adoption of measures to encourage and promote, rather than to restrain, civilian consumption.Various financial and economic measures should be considered, the object of whichwould be to maintain a high and stable level of demand for goods and services ingeneral. It will be necessary at the same time to ensure that this high and stable level of demand is translated effectively into a high and stable level of tradeactivity and of employment, and that economic life is so organised as not to impede the necessary expansion of production.57. One of the most important of our post-war economic problems will bethat of the physical reconstruction of damaged property. It will probably beagreed that rebuilding should be planned with a view to the promotion of publichealth, the reduction of costs of production, and the preservation of amenities.There is, however, another important aspect of this problem. Physical recon-struction may be so timed and so planned as to give powerful aid in the policyof stabilisation.  In the early post-war years, when our building capacity will be
insufficient to meet the demands upon it, it will be necessary to control buildingactivity so as to prevent a competitive scramble and secure due priority for moreimportant and urgent reconstruction work. But it will also be essential to enlargeour building capacity, and for this purpose to secure the entry into the buildingindustry of a large number of additional workers. Both the rate and the scale ofthe expansion to be aimed at should be carefully planned in the light of the needsof physical reconstruction on the one hand, and of the requirements of economic stability on the other.58. In addition to the planning of physical rebuilding and the improvementof housing conditions, it would probably be agreed that there are other ways inwhich the social services should be developed. The objectives of social andeconomic improvement would be difficult in conditions of widespread unemploy-ment, of low production and of a reduced national income; but the maintenanceof a high and stable level of economic activity would greatly ease their attainmentand would reduce the financial burden of the necessary public expenditure.59. Tor all these reasons the Committee propose to proceed on theassumption not only that the policy of stabilisation should be continued as faras possible during the transitional period, but also that the preservation of a highand stable level of economic activity and of employment in subsequent years should be set in the forefront of our economic objectives.Conclusions.i60. If the argument of the preceding sections is correct, the following conclusions seem to suggest themselves : (a) that the rehabilitation of export must be regarded as one of the primeobjectives of post-war policy;(6) that every effort must be made to continue the stabilisation policy;(c) that, for a time, consumer rationing must be maintained;(d) that such commodity controls as may be necessary must be continued;(e) that in order to promote the transfer of resources, recourse must be hadto the mechanism of allocation;(/) that special attention must be given to arrangements (which may haveto be of a regulative character) for promoting labour mobility;(g) that suitable opportunities should be taken to prepare the public forrestraints and. sacrifices that may be entailed during the transition period, if the more distant objectives of economic welfare are to be attained.61. As was indicated at the beginning, this report makes no claim to bean exhaustive treatment even of the subjects with which it deals, and there havebeen deliberately omitted from its range a number of problems which will be ofgreat importance, even in the transition period, e.g., the problem of decon-centration, disposal of stocks, control of the capital market, and the improvementof industrial efficiency. On all these and other matters, further papers are inactive preparation.June 30, 1942.[24189Jd
II.Memorandum prepared by the Treasury on the Post-War relation between Purchasing Power and Consumers&apos; Goods.Note : This memorandum does not purport to deal with our long runpost-war economic position. It is concerned with the post-wartransitional position and offers reasons for expecting that, whatever may be the course of events afterwards, the transitional period of shortage, involving a prevailing high demand for labour, will be longer than it was after the last war.It is hoped to present shortly, with the aid of the Central Statistical Office,some statistical data bearing on our long run economic position on certain assumptions.I. Introductory.1. The experience of the last post-war period supplies the most naturalstarting point for an examination of the probable economic trend after thepresent war. It is true that in many important respects the conditions on this occasion are likely to differ materially from those which prevailed last time.These conditions are liable moreover to be affected by a large variety of factors,including the future course, the duration, and the manner of termination ofthe war,&apos; which cannot at present be foreseen. For these reasons it is important to&quot; scrutinise critically all generalisations suggested by the analogy of 1919-22.None the less, this is the only experience which is at all relevant to our futureproblem; and, in the absence of any other, it inevitably determines the impressions that are instinctively formed. It seems desirable, therefore, to begin with a brief review of the outstanding features of the last post-war experience,followed by an examination of the main respects in which different conditionsare to be expected after the present war.II. The Last Post-war Period.2. The Armistice of November 1918 was followed after a brief period,of hesitation by boom conditions, both at home and in export markets, whichlasted from early in 1919 until the summer of 1920. There was a widespread&quot; re-stocking &quot; movement; that is to say, traders and business men generallyset themselves to rebuild to normal levels stocks which had been depleted duringthe war. Similarly, there was a considerable expenditure on plant byindustrialists endeavouring to turn their works round from war-time to peace-time purposes, or to overtake arrears of renewals that had accumulated duringthe war. There was also a wave of active buying by the consuming public, both at home and abroad. Behind this general activity of demand, there lay asuperabundance of purchasing power in the hands both of the business community and of the general public. These boom conditions, coupled with the rapidremoval of wartime controls, entailed a sharp increase of prices. This causedserious unrest at the time, and helped to aggravate the troubles that arose inthe subsequent depression. None the less the boom helped greatly while itlasted to smooth the process of demobilisation. Some four million men were discharged from the armed forces in the eighteen months after the armistice;yet at no time did the number of ex-Service men in receipt of &apos;&apos; out-of-work&apos;&apos;donation rise t&amp; 400,000. Trades and industries catering for civilian needshad to absorb not only the great bulk of the men demobilised from the forces,but also large numbers of work-people who had been employed in makingmunitions. This colossal task which had given rise to serious apprehensionsbeforehand, was&quot; accomplished with a remarkable measure of success. Untilthe summer of 1920 public opinion in Great Britain, as in the United States,and indeed generally throughout the world,&apos;was mainly preoccupied not with unemployment, but with the rise in the cost of living, profiteering, the &apos;&apos; viciousspiral,&quot; and other symptoms of a boom.3. This boom broke in the summer of 1920, and by 1921 the prevailingconditions were those of depression throughout British industry.   Prices and
wages fell heavily, and unemployment reached large-scale dimensions. Butthough the depression was severe for a time, it was not very prolonged. Theprocess of recovery became clearly marked during 1922, and continued steadilyuntil by the spring of 1924, a condition of considerable activity had been reached.The incompleteness of this recovery reflected in part a failure to regain theexport markets which had been lost during the war; a failure which was tobecome more clearly marked in subsequent years. During these particular years(1922-24) the British coal-mining industry, which was later to become thecentre of depression, received adventitious aid. from the decline of Continentalcoal production resulting from the occupation of the Ruhr. None the less, thecontrast between &apos;&apos; sheltered &apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; unsheltered &apos;&apos; industries had been recognised as early as 1923 as constituting the crux of the British post-warindustrial problem. The extent of the recovery during these years was perhapsobscured at the time by the fact that the unemployment figures seemed more serious than they really were to minds that were influenced by statisticalstandards derived from the very different pre-1914 trade union percentages.4. The fluctuations of activity between 1919 and 1924 were not, of course,uninfluenced by the policies, financial monetary and economic, that were pursuedduring this period. In the sphere of public finance, policy was dominated bythe objective, which was unquestionably accepted in all quarters of restoringa balanced budget at the earliest practicable moment, coupled with the subsidiaryobjective of maintaining equilibrium at a steadily falling level of revenue andexpenditure. Taxation was only gradually reduced from the high war-timelevels. Expenditure was quickly and drastically curtailed; the subsidies whichhad been given, e.g., for-bread and coal, to check the rise in the cost of livingwere soon withdrawn, as part of this policy, and the process of retrenchmentwas carried further in 1922 by the application of the &quot; Geddes Axe.&quot;5. Another branch of financial policy exeited an important influence onthe course of events. During 1919, the attempt was made to &quot; fund &quot; the large volume of short-term debt which had accumulated during the war, and the victory and Funding Loans were issued with this object in view. Credit policy was directed so as to facilitate these funding operations; and conditions whichit is fair to regard as &quot;cheap money&quot; conditions were maintained for aconsiderable time despite the inflationary movement that was in progress.6. This, however, was only a passing phase. By the end of 1919 it hadbeen decided to follow the course proposed by the Committee on Currency andForeign Exchanges After the War (&quot;The Cunliffe Committee&quot;) which maybe roughly summarised as a policy of gradual monetary deflation with a viewto the re-establishment of an effective gold standard. The most preciserecommendation of the Cunliffe Committee was that&quot; the fiduciary note issueshould be limited by law, and thereafter gradually reduced by making theactual maximum reached in any year the legal maximum for the year following.This recommendation was adopted by Treasury minute in December 1919; and since the limitation of currency could not be effective without a correspondingcurtailment of bank credit, credit policy had to be adjusted to this decision.Credit conditions became accordingly more stringent, the process culminating inan increase of the Bank rate to 7 per cent, in April 1920. This was quicklyfollowed -by the collapse of the boom; though how far this result was due to therestriction of credit, how far to a natural exhaustion of the &quot;re-stocking&quot;process, and how far to&apos; the contemporary slump in the prices of primary productsoverseas, is a question which necessarily admits of argument. It is to be notedthat up to this point the chief public criticism passed upon the policy pursuedwas that the application of the brake of dear money was unduly slow andhesitating.7. Although the inflationary trend was definitely reversed within a fewmonths, Bank rate was maintained at 7 per cent, for over a year. This may havebeen a material factor in the intensity of the depression in 1921. The prolongedmaintenance of dear money was attributable to a Combination of three influences :(1) the adoption of the policy of the Cunliffe Committee; (2) the fall in ,theexchange value of sterling; (3) the course of events in other countries, particularly the United States. . .      &apos;[24189]
8. The pound, which had been &quot; pegged&quot; ,during the war at an exchange-rate with the United States dollar of $4-76^, was unpegged in March 1919. Itfell quickly and heavily, reaching a level of $3-20 within a year, from which it made a recovery which was for some time hesitating and chequered, reaching$4 in May 1921, but falling back to 13-60 in July 1921. To raise this exchanges-rate, with a view to the ultimate restoration of the gold standard on the basisof the traditional gold value for the pound, was widely regarded as an importantobjective of monetary policy; and the pursuit of this objective, which wasaccomplished in 1925, exerted an influence in the intervening years,, varying in strength from time to time on internal credit policy.9. In the United States the course of trade was very similar to that inGreat Britain. There was the same early boom and inflationary tendency, thoughthe rise of prices, as was natural in view of the fall of the pound, was less marked.There was the same reversal in the summer of 1920, following on tighter creditconditions, which culminated in a rise of the New York rediscount rate to 7 percent, in June of that year. There was the same sequel of a heavy fall of prices and an intense depression; there is the same possibility that this depression maybe largely attributable to the fact that the rediscount rate was also maintained at 7 per cent, for about a year; and there was a somewhat similar foreign exchangecomplication, in that the maintenance of dear money was largely due to the factthat the United States had been losing gold. Finally, in the United States also,there was a comparatively early recovery. This began sooner, being evident earlyin 1922, and was more decided than the recovery in Great Britain. There wasno loss of pre-war export markets by the United States to impede and obscure theextent of the internal recovery; and by March 1923 a condition of high productiveactivity had been reached, with renewed inflationary symptoms, which were thesignal for a contraction of credit. It seems probable that the United Statesrecovery ,in 1922-23 was a major influence in causing the recovery in GreatBritain.&apos;10. In the belligerent countries of the European Continent the inflationarytrend was not reversed in 1920, but continued in the ensuing years with a gatheringmomentum, until it culminated in some countries in a complete currency collapseand in others in a depreciation of the value of the currency to a small fraction ofits previous value.11. It is of some interest to consider briefly the course of publicly financedcapital expenditure (commonly described as expenditure on &quot;public work&quot;)during the period under examination in Great Britain. The total expenditureof local authorities financed by borrowing was as follows : (  millions.)1920-21.    1921-22.    1922-23. 1923-2A-Housing    ......      52-2         81-7         29-6 11-3Roads       ...      ...        3-6          6-2          9-0 8-other purposes    ....    .38-6         40-8         33-0 32-4Total...       ....      94-4        128-7 71-6 50-0In the phase of slump, road-building programmes, for which the developmentof motoring offered substantial scope, were pushed forward, largely with theobject of mitigating unemployment. The above figures show, however, that house-building was the dominating factor in the volume of public works expenditure.The house-building activity was attributable to the housing policy initiated inthe boom phase in order to make good the acute housing shortage left behind bythe war. It reached its peak in the slump years. In 1922 it underwent a verysharp curtailment as the result of changes in policy prompted by the increasingpreoccupation with retrenchment. Thus whatever public works expenditure mayhave contributed toward mitigating unemployment during 1921, the ensuing-recovery took place despite a substantial net curtailment in the volume of this expenditure.12. Commercial policy did not exert an important influence on the trend of activity during this period. A limited range of industries was protected againstoverseas competition by the Safeguarding and Key Industries .Measures; -and
by the retention until 1924 of the McKenna duties. But these represented com-paratively minor exceptions to the general rule of the maintenance of a Free trade policy.13. For the present purpose it seems unnecessary to carry the story in anydetail beyond 1924. The prolonged malaise that ensued in British economic lifewas largely attributable to a cause associated with the war, namely, the loss of export markets by industries such as coal and cotton, which were so highlylocalised that it was not easy for their redundant labour-force to obtain alternative employment. An important influence may also have been exerted by the restora-tion of sterling to its pre-war exchange parity in connexion with the return tothe gold standard. But such influences differ in kind from those, such as themovement to &quot;re-stock,&quot; which represent more or less normal reactions to war conditions, as such; and there is no similar presumption that they are likely tobe repeated. It is pertinent to observe that the rough similarity between theBritish and American trends which had prevailed until 1924 was replaced forsome years by a broad contrast between unemployment in Great Britain andabounding prosperity in the United States.14. The foregoing analysis may be summed up as follows. In the courseof trade activity in Great Britain between 1919 and 1924, three phases can be distinguished :  (1) A phase of inflationary boom conditions, marked by rapidly rising prices,during which demobilised labour was absorbed on a very large scale.-The main impetus to this inflationary trend was supplied by the need to restock both at home and abroad, and to overtake arrears of plantrenewals. An essential underlying condition was a superabundanceof purchasing-power. The movement was further stimulated by themaintenance of easy credit conditions in the interest of fundingoperations, by the removal of war-time controls, by the withdrawalof subsidies to the cost of living, by the fact that none the less theBudget was not yet balanced, and by the heavy fall in the exchange value of sterling.(2) A phase of general depression, beginning in the summer of 1920, whichthough severe an d accompanied by a heavy fall of prices and wage-rates, was not very prolonged. This may have represented in part a natural reaction, after &quot; re-stocking &quot; had been largely accomplishedfrom the preceding boom. But it was probably intensified by the factthat the stringent credit conditions which had been employed to checkthat boom were maintained for over a year, by the effect on purchasing-power of drastic budgetary retrenchment, and by the repercussions of a similar depression in the United States.(3) A phase of substantial recovery, especially in production for the home market, which began in 1922. A major influence in promoting thisrecovery was probably the more complete recovery that set in in theUnited States; and the fact that the recovery was slower and lessdecided here was probably partly due to the recovery in the exchange value of sterling and to the credit policy pursued with that object in view.It is. evident from this review that the widespread impression that theArmistice was quickly followed by a prolonged period of uninterrupted depressionis far from being accurate even as regards Great Britain; while in most otherbelligerent countries, the prevailing trend for many years was either towardsinflation (as on the European Continent) or one of exceptional trade activity(as in the United States).III. Probable Differences in the Next Post-War Period:.   -15. Any attempt to forecast the respects in which the conditions after thepresent war may be expected to differ from those after the last war must be largely speculative in character, arid open to varieties of-judgment. We cannottell as yet when the war will end, how it will end, what sort of a world it will leave behind, or even whether it will end, as did the last war, at approximately the same time throughout the world.  All these uncertainties, and more especially
the last, have an important bearing on the present problem. It is possible, how-ever, that these uncertainties affect the degree rather than the character or thedirection of the differences which are to be expected; and that the latter can be indicated with some degree of confidence. They may be considered under twobroad heads, internal and external respectively. ,(A) Internal.16.-(1) It seems probable that the process of demobilisation, both from the armed forces and from war production will be less sharp and sudden after this war than after the last. The outlook is complicated by the possibility that thewar may end at widely separated times in different parts of the world; so that operations may continue, say, in the Far East after peace has been re-established in Europe. In that case, the demobilisation of some of those absorbed in the war effort, those in particular concerned with defence against air attack or invasion,might have been undertaken before the final end of the war. But apart from this possibility, it would seem prudent to assume that we may find it necessary tomaintain armed forces of considerable strength for at least some years after thewar is over. It seems unlikely that we shall be in a hurry to reduce the Air force to small dimensions, and the production of certain types of armaments, such asaeroplanes and tanks may well be continued on an important scale. Thisprobability will be increased if the international political outlook remainsclouded for whatever reason.(2) A second difference arises from the physical destruction which has been caused by air bombardment during the present war, the scale of which may possibly become materially greater before the war is over. Capital assets of alarge variety of kinds houses, factories, warehouses, shops, public utilities will need replacement, and we shall be faced as a consequence with a substantial task of physical reconstruction and rebuilding. In so far as an abnormally large volume of work of this capital character has to be undertaken, the consequencesare likely to be similar to those of war-time armament expenditure; i.e., pur-chasing power will be generated without a commensurate increase in consumers&apos;goods. It is true that the magnitude of the task may not prove so great inpractice as is often supposed. The available data relating to War Damage claimssuggests that the losses so far caused by air bombardment are on a smaller scale than might have been expected. It is important, moreover, to remember on theother side, that one of the factors which underlay the housing shortage of the1920&apos;s, and the prolonged demand for additional houses, is not likely to exert thesame influence in the next post-war period. This was the abnormally rapid growth in the number of family units, which was largely a reflection of the fact that theannual number of births in the United Kingdom was at its maximum early inthe century. Despite the war-time destruction, therefore, it is possible that new houses will not be required on a larger scale than after the last war. Theimportance of the factor of greater physical destruction depends, therefore,mainly on what happens during the remainder of the war.(3) War production is absorbing a larger proportion of our productive resources than wras the case in 1914-18, and, apart from essential foods, the supplyof goods available for meeting civilian demands is being more drasticallycurtailed. There was no parallel in the last war to the present Limitation ofSupplies Orders, or to the scheme for concentrating industry. So far asconsumers&apos; goods are concerned, the depletion of stocks is likely, therefore, to bemore marked and more widespread when the war ends than it was in 1918; andit is also probable, especially in view of the large number of factories which arenow being used as warehouses, that it will take longer to restore the productionof goods for civilian purposes to normal dimensions, to overtake arrears of capitalmaintenance and renewal.(4) The excess of accumulated purchasing-power which is banked up under war conditions, but which is likely to be thrown upon the market when peace isrestored, will probably be much larger upon this occasion. After 1918 there wasno very marked tendency to encash the savings certificates which had beenaccumulated during the war. It would be unsafe to assume that this experiencewill be repeated, in view of the greater extent to which the satisfaction of pressingneeds has been postponed owing to the unobtainability of goods. Further, thearrangement under which part of the sums which the State is now taking fromthe taxpayer are being credited to him, will serve to increase the volume of
purchasing-power liable to be directed to the purchase of consumers&apos; goods. this tendency is likely to be accentuated by the strenuous efforts that are being made during the war to keep down the prices of essential goods in order to prevent thedevelopment of a prices-wages spiral; for this means that a smaller part of the redundant purchasing-power that is being created is absorbed in buying goodsat inflated prices.(5) This redundancy of purchasing power is not likely to be absorbed as quickly as it was after the last war by drastic measures of financial retrenchment.Some of the war-time subsidies, notably those to cover increases in farming costs,will probably have to be retained in the post-war period, in order to avert anincrease in the cost of living. On the other hand, it will not be easy to maintainthe high war-time rates of taxation, having regard to the extent to which theyfall on the smaller income ranges and the extreme severity of their applicationto the higher ranges. It may well be that for such reasons, coupled with the factthat budgetary equilibrium is no longer so universally accepted as an imperativerequirement of sound finance, unbalanced budgets will persist for considerablylonger than after the last war. Apart from this possibility, moreover, there islikely to be a considerable volume of Government expenditure, e.g., the compensa-tion payments under the War Damage Acts, which, though not forming part ofthe annual budgetary expenditure, will serve none the less to increase the purchasing power at the disposal of the community.(B) External.(6) The balance of international payments with which we shall emerge fromthe present war is likely to be seriously adverse; and we shall be faced with animperative need to restore this balance to equilibrium within a reasonable period,either by increasing our exports or by curtailing our imports. The pressure upon us in these directions will be made the more urgent by our loss of exchange resources and by the large sterling balances which India, the Dominions andforeign countries will have accumulated. In so far as we succeed in increasingexports, the productive capacity available for producing goods for the home market will be correspondingly reduced. A reduction of imports would alsoserve to reduce the supplies of goods with which the needs of the home populationcould be satisfied. In either case, therefore, the process of correcting the adverse balance will exert an influence tending to maintain an excess of demand oversupply. There was no tendency of this character after the last war. We enteredthat war with a highly favourable balance of .payments, which represented, as itwere, fat that we could afford to lose. We emerged from that war with the lossof something like one-quarter of our former export trade, and we never made thisloss good; but we were not as a consequence under any compelling need to curtailour imports, the volume of which in fact tended to increase.(7) It is not only in this country that the intensity of the war effort, as measured by the proportion of productive resources absorbed by war purposes, ismuch greater in tine present war than in that of 1914-18. It is certain that beforethe war ends, this will be true as a general world phenomenon. In the UnitedStates the production of various types of goods for civilian purposes, notably, forexample, automobiles, is already being drastically curtailed. There was noparallel to this in the last war. Again, though Japan was technically a belligerentin the last war, her economic life was not seriously involved in war production;and she emerged in 1919 with a greatly increased capacity to produce for export.Thus, so far as industrial products at least are concerned, prevailing world conditions of shortage seem likely to be more prolonged after the present war.(8) Active military operations have already spread over a far wider areathan during the last war, and have entailed a greater degree of destruction andeconomic dislocation. Although there will be less physical damage to be made good in France and Belgium, there will be much more in Russia and the Far East.Moreover, the possibility cannot be excluded that the world output of severalprimary commodities, notably tin, rubber and oil, may be seriously reduced for aconsiderable period by military development before the end of the war is reached.(9) There is also the possibility, which it is not easy at present to assess,that the present war will leave behind it a greater degree of political and socialconfusion than the last. In 1918 the Central Powers and their Allies collapsedsuddenly and very nearly simultaneously, and the military collapse was associatedwith political revolutions.  For the most part, however, these political revolutions
took a form in which an orderly Government was promptly substituted for theprevious regime, and it was only in a comparatively limited area in eastern europe that economic reconstruction was seriously impeded by political chaos.It cannot confidently be assumed that this experience will be repeated. It maybe that unsettled political conditions will interfere far more seriously after thepresent war with the revival of peace-time production over a large part of theworld.17. It will be readily appreciated that all the foregoing differences tell inthe same direction, from the standpoint of the question under examination. Eachof them will tend to prolong the period during which the prevailing conditions must be expected to be those of an excess of purchasing power over the supply ofgoods. The process of demobilisation is likely to be more gradual and lesscomplete; there will be more physical damage to make good, a greater exhaustion of stocks to be replenished, a greater diversion of industrial plant to war production to undo, a larger banking-up of purchasing power in the hands of consumers with larger unsatisfied wants, a more pressing need to devote more of our productive capacity to export work, and a greater difficulty in obtaining supplies from overseas. These tendencies will probably be reinforced by budgetdeficits continuing for considerably longer than after the last war, and by more severe conditions of general world shortage. It is impossible at tJhe present stage to evaluate the strength of these various influences; but the longer the warlasts, and the more its future course is marked by unexpected developments, thegreater is&apos;their importance likely to become.18. It remains, however, to consider possible influences of a somewhat different character from those examined, namely, those which may arise from the gradual long-run trend of economic development, and those connected with changes in ideas and policy.IV. The Long-Run Economic Trend.19. The main influence to be considered under this heading is that of thecontinued advance in industrial productivity arising from technological improve-me.nt which, moreover, has probably become more rapid, taking the economic system as a whole, than it was formerly. The productive capacity of the industrial countries of the European and North American Continents was certainly farlarger at the outset of the war than&quot;was required to sustain the standard of livingthat actually prevailed. In some countries an important fraction of thisproductive power was wasted in the form of the unemployment, or. partialemployment, of plant and labour; and the services of a large and growing numberof persons were absorbed in functions such as advertising and sales promotion,which were of doubtful social utility and could certainly be largely curtailedwithout any material injury to the standard of life. In other countries animportant fraction of the productive power was devoted to large-scale prepara-tions for war; and the success of Nazi Germany in particular in building up an overwhelming military strength without any very marked lowering of her livingstandard, although she had not the advantage of the possession of internationalcapital assets, suggests that the margin of productive power which a modernindustrial country wastes in one way or another, is larger than has hitherto been realised. This wasted margin must have grown considerably in the inter-war period. If, therefore, the shortages to be overtaken after the present war will.be, for the reasons previously given, more serious and more widespread thanthey were in 1918, it can be argued, on the other hand, that modern societies willbe more powerfully equipped for overtaking them.20. A special feature of the technological progress of the last generationwas its marked extension to the production of many agricultural commodities.During the last ten years, before the present war, a pronounced condition ofover-supply became apparent for a large range of agricultural commodities,leading to the accumulation of vast surpluses. War conditions have led to the disappearance of many of these surpluses, and it is not unlikely that substantialinroads may be made into those that still remain before the war is over. none the less, the probability suggested by the available statistical data is -thatabundant supplies of certain basic agricultural commodities, notably wheat and
cotton, will be available to meet the world&apos;s post-war demands. After the last war there was a prevailing scarcity of wheat for several years; and in thisrespect, at least, it seems probable that the situation after the present war willbe more favourable to consumers.21. Thus the influence of the long-run economic trend will be in the opposite direction to that of the considerations enumerated in the preceding section. Itseems unlikely, however, although the matter does not permit of a conclusivejudgment, that this will be strong enough to reverse the conclusion, to which thoseconsiderations point, that a longer period during which demand generally willtrend to exceed supply is to be expected. The larger available margin of productive power that is normally wasted will not affect the problem until it hasbeen effectively directed to the production of peace-time goods; and this is likelyto take a considerable time. The prospect of a more abundant supply of certainagricultural commodities is uncertain and limited in scope; and its significanceis rather that it may make it easier to check a serious inflationary developmentduring the phrase of &quot; boom &quot; than that it is likely to bring that boom to anearly end. On the whole, therefore, it seems reasonable to regard the long-runtrend as a factor tending to qualify rather than to alter the prospect, suggestedby the previous analysis, of a longer period of a prevailing excess of purchasing-power: though subsequently, of course, it may well become once again a factor of dominating importance.V. Ideas and Policy.22. The course of economic events after the war may be greatly affected bypolicy. It would obviously exceed the proper scope of this paper to attempt a systematic forecast of the policy that is likely to be pursued, the more so because it may be affected in turn by the diagnosis that is accepted as to the probablecourse of events. None the less there are some matters, so highly relevant to theproblem, upon which differences in the objective situation and differences inprevailing ideas between the two post-war periods are so likely to result indifference, of policy, that it seems desirable to take account of them.23. In the first place, there has been an important change in the general attitude towards the maintenance of economic controls. After the last war,there was a prevalent and strong desire to sweep away the whole system of war-time controls as rapidly as possible with a view to the restoration of normal peace-time conditions. The indications are that this desire will be at any rateless strong, less unqualified and less sweeping after the present war. There is,indeed, a more widespread scepticism as to whether our pre-war arrangementsrepresented the natural and normal economic system, and as to whether,accordingly, it is either desirable or practicable to aim at re-establishing themwith the fewest possible changes. If, moreover, the conditions at the end of thewar are marked by an acute shortage of shipping and other key factors, there islikely to be a fairly general recognition of the need to maintain a considerable measure of control over our economic life for such purposes as the prior satis-faction of more urgent needs and the re-building of our capacity to produce forexport.24. The wholesale removal of controls in 1919 served to stimulate the inflationary developments which marked the &apos;&apos; boom&apos;5 period, and it may thus have contributed something by way of reaction to the severity of the slump thatfollowed. Although the forces tending in the inflationary direction are likely,as the preceding analysis has suggested, to be stronger after the present warthan they were last time, the greater readiness to accept the continuance of controls may help to make it easier to hold these forces in check.25. In this connexion, however, another aspect of the problem should be mentioned. A condition of things in which the supply of purchasing-powertends to exceed the supply of available goods, does not imply that unemploymentwill be negligible. The transfer of production from a war-time to a peace-time basis will give rise, just as the reverse process does, to unbalanced production;&quot;bottle-necks&quot; and hold-ups; and many workpeople may find themselvesunemployed for a time, not because the demand for the products of their industrvis insufficient, but because production is insufficient somewhere else or because[24189] e
the supplies of imported materials are insufficient. Such obstacles to the speedy restarting of industry may be more serious after the present war thanthey were after the last. It may take a considerable time, for example, to restartmany of the factories which have been closed clown under &apos;&apos; concentrationschemes. Shortages of certain materials, e.g., rubber, may also be severe. Apartfrom such &apos;&apos; bottle-neck &apos;&apos; problems, the reabsorption in peace-time economic life of large numbers of persons from the fighting services and from war pro-duction entails difficult problems of personal adjustment, and a small percentagemay remain unemployed as a consequence, despite a strong demand for labour ingeneral.26. The problems of post-war policy will be made more complicated andmore difficult by special unemployment of this latter character. The remarkablesuccess with which vast numbers of demobilised soldiers and workpeople wereabsorbed in civilian economic life within the eighteen months that followed theArmistice of 1918, may have been greatly aided by the intensity of the re-stockingboom and by its inflationary accompaniments. The rise in selling prices keptwell&apos;ahead of the rise in costs of production, and, though this carried other evils inits train, general business conditions were so profitable, or so apparently profitable,that employers were anxious to engage additional labour, and could afford topay less regard than they might otherwise have felt bound to do, to its efficiencyfor the work in question. If controls, designed for such purposes as preventingan undue rise of prices and restraining home consumption with a view torebuilding an adequate volume of exports, are retained for a considerable period after the present war, the result may be to slow down the rate of.reabsorption.This will not necessarily be a disadvantage; the process of demobilisation itselfmay, as has been indicated, be less sharp and sudden, so that a less rapid rate ofreabsorption may prove to be all that is required. But if this possibility is not realised, and demobilisation is effected with a rapidity comparable to that of1919, some conflict of objectives may possibly arise; and the task of avoidinginflation may be made more difficult by ill-judged pressure for general removalof restrictions when, in fact, other measures would be appropriate and adequate to meet the case.27. In regard to monetary policy, there have also been changes both inprevailing ideas and in the objective facts of the situation, which may have animportant bearing on post-war developments. As has been seen in Section II the severity of the comparatively short-lived slump in 1921 in Great Britain and in theUnited States may have been partly due in both countries to the continuance, fora considerable period after the inflationary trend had been reversed, of the highmoney^rates which were established in 1920. It seems unlikely for various reasonsthat an influence of this kind will operate after the present war. The delay in reducing money-rates until the middle of 1921 was largely attributable in both countries to exchange considerations. The United States had been losing gold to spain and. Argentina, and appeared to be threatened with a loss of gold to japan in view of the embarrassing magnitude of the gold reserves which the UnitedStates now possesses, it is most unlikely that any difficulty would be caused bya future outflow, even if it should occur. The continuance of dear money inGreat Britain was explained partly by its continuance in the United States, andpartly by the desire to raise the gold value of the pound; and, as will be suggestedlater, there is no reason to suppose that the latter complication will affect policyafter the present war. It must be remembered, moreover, that according.to the traditional view, gold movements or foreign exchange tendencies were regarded,as was natural under gold standard conditions, as the proper determinant of credit policy. The idea that in the event of an industrial depression the chiefaim of credit policy should be to promote industrial recovery had. hardly begun to win acceptance in 1920 or 1921.28. In view of these various changes, it may be assumed that if, after thepresent war, an initial post-war &apos;&apos; boom &apos;&apos; should be followed by a sharp set-back,credit policy would be adopted far more quickly so as to make its contributionto preventing this set-back from developing into a severe depression.. how important this contribution would prove in practice is perhaps a somewhatspeculative question, particularly if it were to be supposed that the initial phase of boom had been accompanied by a serious inflationary movement.   None the
less, there is at least a possibility that, under altered monetary conditions, any future analogue to the slump of 1921 might be much less severe.29. The prevailing trend of activity over a longer period may also beaffected by the probable differences in monetary conditions. As has been suggestedin Section - II, the contrast between British economic malaise and Americanprosperity between 1923 and 1929 was probably attributable partly to the lossof export markets by old-established and highly localised industries, and partly to the difficulties entailed by the restoration of the pound to its time-honouredparity with gold, and consequently with the dollar. Since we have now beenoff the gold standard for more than ten years, no particular parity possesses thesanctity that formerly attached to $4-86. The maintenance of exchangestability may, it is true, be regarded as an important objective; and this mayexert an influence on internal policy. But it is one thing to resist a depreciation of the exchange,, and quite another to bring about a large appreciation such as&apos;was effected between 1922 and 1925. There seems no reason to suppose thatexchange appreciation will be a serious factor in the problems of British economic life in the next post-war decade.30. It seems equally doubtful whether there will be any parallel to theother main factor which played a part in our malaise between 1923 and 1929,namely the loss of export markets. by highly localised industries. We must expect, it is true, that our export trade in many lines will be adversely affected bythe stimulus that the war has given to the development of manufactures inundeveloped countries. On the other hand, most of our principal industrial.competitors are engaged, or are likely to become engaged, in war production ina degree far more comparable with our own proportion than was the case in thelast war. Moreover, the Restoration of equilibrium to our balance of payments will be a vital objective of our policy, in a sense in which this was not true lasttime; so that we may expect a greater concentration of effort on the promotion of export trade. Finally, it seems unlikely that any loss of export trade will be concentrated in the same degree as in the last post-war decade on industries ofthe same highly-localised character. There is no reason, therefore, to suppose that it would give rise to an equally difficult problem of large-scale unemploymentconcentrated in particular areas.VI. C conclusion.31. The analysis in Section III led to the conclusion, qualified but notoverborne by the counter-balancing considerations examined in Section IV, thatthe phase of &apos;&apos; boom&apos;&apos; after the present war is likely to be longer, and might prove considerably longer, than after 1918. This conclusion is subject, of course,to the reserves that must necessarily attach to any attempt to forecast post-war conditions. On the other hand, its practical significance is perhaps greater thanmay appear at first sight, and is heightened by the considerations discussed, inSection V.&apos; 32. It was observed in Section II that the popular impression that thelast war was followed almost immediately by a prolonged depression is far fromaccurate. The depression which reached its nadir in 1921 was not, in fact, moreprolonged than the boom which preceded it: The recovery which began in 1922was, it is true, in Great Britain, hesitating and incomplete. But in the UnitedStates the story was very different. There the recovery of 1922 led within ayear to conditions of full activity, which were maintained without seriousinterruption until the end of 1929. Indeed, the trend of economic activity inthe United States in the post-war decade may be fairly summed up as ten yearsof exceptional trade activity, broken only by a sharp but short-lived slump, lastingfrom the summer of 1920 until early in 1922. The severity of this short-livedslump was partly due to circumstances that need not be repeated. What is perhaps more important, the divergent experience of Great Britain after 1923was also due to circumstances that need not be repeated. So far as the trend ofindustrial activity is concerned, though not necessarily in other respects, there seems no reason why our experience after the present war should not resemblethe last post-war experience of the United States more closely than our own.33.   It  is   important,  however,   that   this   conclusion   should   hot   be misinterpreted.   The presumption that arises from the analysis summarised in
the preceding paragraph is that, notwithstanding the possibility of a temporarysetback to an early post-war boom, the period between the cessation of hostilitiesand the time when a persistent and general tendency for supply to exceed effectivedemand reasserts itself as a major source of economic difficulty may be considerablylonger than two or three years. But this does not mean that no serious economicdangers are to be apprehended. On the contrary, problems of shortage may beno less formidable than problems of over-supply. These problems will, of course,be most serious in the immediate post-war period. During the remainder of thewar shortages of essential goods may become more acute and more widespread,so as to entail a more substantial degree of deprivation than exists at present. Itwill take time to overcome these shortages, particularly in view of the probableneed to divert shipping and supplies to meet the needs of liberated countries inEurope and elsewhere. On the other hand, there is a danger that the presentmood of readiness to accept sacrifices may give way when the war is over to animpatient demand for the restoration of pre-war standards; and this might prove a source of friction which would in turn impede the restoration of our productivepower.34. It is possible, however, that problems of shortage may persist for amore extended period; not because our productive capacity is likely to be insufficient once it has been restored, but because we may find ourselves unable tosell enough in world markets to purchase the large imports of food and rawmaterials that are essential to maintain our pre-war standard of living. this raises the problem of external economic relations, which lies outside the scope ofthe present Memorandum. The Continental inflations of the 1920&apos;s serve,however, to indicate how serious and prolonged the dangers might be, if thatproblem is not satisfactorily solved. Inflationary conditions, as has been pointedout above, persisted in several countries for many years after the last war was over; and in most cases a major underlying cause was lack of means to buyfrom abroad.35. It is obvious, of course, that the reservations that must be made for theunforeseeable and the unknown become greater as the period is extended. Forthis reason the second of the conclusions summarised below must be taken assubject to a greater margin of uncertainty than the first. It is inevitable,however, that post-war planning should be based in some degree or! certainhypotheses as to the probable economic trend; and it is suggested that the workinghypotheses adopted for this purpose should be as follows : -(1) that after the cessation of hostilities an initial phase of &quot;boom,&quot;accompanied by the risk of an inflationary movement, is to be expected,and that this phase is likely to last longer than it did in Great Britainafter 1918;(2) that there may be a still longer period before a persistent tendency for supply to exceed effective demand reasserts itself, as distinct fromtemporary trade setbacks; and that during this period, if no satisfactory solution is found for the external economic problem,inflation may remain our most serious danger.36. The moral would seem to be that, while we must be prepared from the outset with appropriate measures for such special unemployment as may arise from the maladjustments of the transitional period, the main problem of thatperiod will not be that of stimulating the effective demand for goods and services,but rather of controlling and directing it, so as to ensure the orderly recovery ofour economic life, including adequate production for export. As, however, thelength of this transitional period must necessarily be a matter of uncertainty, itis desirable that the plans that are prepared should have a high degree of flexibility, in particular as regards timing.
