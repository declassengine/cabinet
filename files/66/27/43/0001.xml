Possiblefast by Gandhi9   Cabinet have considered Governors views and await .your definite proposals.   They fully appreciate your difficulties and possible reactions of having Gandlai die on your hands, but wish to be assured that you are not in danger of letting hira defeat you.   If it isa question of letting hira out what exactly does that mean?   If it means freedom to coHrrrunicate with political sympathisers and makecapital out of his release he will clearly have scored.   Or is allthat you contemplate sending him back to Sevagrara (where responsibilityfor looking after him will be that of his personal friends) but firstisolating his ashram effectively from outside world?   Could that be effectively done?   If he then starved he may have starved as a protest but not under your charge.   If that is your policy then therewould seom to be much&apos;to be said for shifting him to Sevagram as soonas he starts, repeat starts, fasting- so that there could be noquestion of his health having beon affected in detention and the wholeresponsibility would remain his own and that of his domestic circle^1%   hiay we take it that both at Poona now and at Sevagram (under-above plan) means are effective not only to prevent him and retinuefrom sending messages out but also from, receiving news from ouiyidoparticularly of progress of&quot;civil disobedience?3*   Similarly aro those detained in Ahmednagar fort kept withoutoutside news as well as from sending messages?   Are. they prevented]from comrriunication among -Jjhemsclves?
