Ma. - &amp;     \ 238THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1942.SECRET. Copy No. 29W.F. (42) 364.Auaust 17, 1942.WAR CABINET.PUBLICATION OP DOCUMENTS ILLUSTRATING THE COURSE of anglo-GERMAN RELATIONS BETWEEN LOCARNO and march  1939.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN his memorandum &quot;W.P. (42) 187 of the 8th May, the Lord Chancellorreviewed some of the arguments for and against the publication of the selection of diplomatic documents prepared in the Foreign Office on Anglo-German rela-tions from 1925-39. While recognising the weight of the arguments on the other side, the Lord Chancellors conclusion was against the early publication of these documents.2. I have given further consideration to this question in the light of theLord Chancellors comments, the force of which I fully recognise. I have not hitherto wished to press this matter again upon the attention of my colleagueswhen their time is taken up by other and more urgent matters. On reflection, Iconsider, however, that this question is one of such importance for our post-warrelations, especially with the United States, and for the formulation of a soundpolicy backed by public opinion in regard to Germany, that I feel bound to put before my colleagues the following considerations advanced in amplification of myoriginal memorandum W.P. (G) (41) 139 of the 26th November, 1941.3. It has been suggested that publication may arouse biased controversywhich might affect unity at home and between us and our Allies. Unfortunately,a bias against British policy before the war is already in existence, and the onlyreason that there is no controversy is because the British case is now going bydefault. Attacks on British policy before September 1939 are continuous (and inmany cases venomous), both here and more particularly in the United States inbooks, pamphlets, reviews, lectures, &amp;c. Many more or less distinguished Germanemigres are now established in the United States. Some, such as Dr. Briining,hold university chairs and are giving their versions of pre-war diplomacy to the rising generation in the United States. Others are collaborating with UnitedStates intelligence organisations. Although these people are no doubt anti-Nazi,it would be too much to expect that their version of events before 1939 would be favourable to this country. The time is long past when we could safely ignoremisrepresentations and calumnies about our policy in the United States. Thesecalumnies can only be refuted by an expose of the true facts as revealed in Britishofficial documents.4. We have also to consider reactions in the Soviet Union. The view is stillwidely held, and not only in Soviet circles, that British policy. before the waraimed at placating Germany and embroiling the U.S.S.R. with Germany.Although it may be true that no sane person would deny the immediate respon-sibility of Hitler and the German leaders for the present sufferings of the world,there is a school of thought, which will become much stronger at the peace, whichmaintains that British pre-war policy is indirectly responsible for Hitler&apos;s riseto power from 1925-33 and for giving him a free run in Europe from 1933-39.Large blocs of influential opinion here and abroad, in fact, hold the view that we11827   [24237]
encouraged Hitler, and only turned against him when it became obvious that his policy would directly endanger British interests. This illusion will, I fear,persist, and gather strength until we dispose of it by publishing the true facts.5. I do not think that we need be deterred by the probability that only alimited number of students and experts will read the documents in ecctenso. Itis, after all, these experts who will in the long run guide and influence publicopinion, and I think they can in general be relied upon to make good use of thematerial with which we should supply them. Otherwise they must inevitablyfind their material from hostile and often inaccurate sources, with disastrousresults to our interests. The wider public will not, however, be overlooked, asa shorter edition of the documents has been prepared which is one-third the size of the full collection. The Stationery Office anticipate a wide sale for thissummary. No doubt unfriendly critics here and in America and anti-NaziGermans, whose main thesis will be demolished by our publication, will pick uponpoints of detail and make the most of them. There will certainly be criticism ofBritish policy during the years in question, but I consider that the risks ofinaction far outweigh the risks involved in this ephemeral type of criticism.6. As regards the choice of documents for publication, it is true thatdiplomatic documents cannot recount the whole story, and that the historian willrequire to supplement them by Parliamentary speeches and a record of thetendencies of British opinion. These Parliamentary speeches and material fora study of British opinion are, however, already available to experts and to thegeneral public, and would be out of place in a collection of diplomatic documents.Reference would be made in the foreword of the collection to the fact that parliamentary speeches are accessible in published form, and there would benumerous direct references to Hansard. It also occurs to me that serious criticism might be provoked if an objective documentary record of this kindincluded only governmental speeches in important debates without also includingthe chief Opposition speeches. In any event,&quot; the fact that public speeches haveunfortunately hitherto failed to persuade large sections of public opinion here and abroad of the true aims of pre-war British foreign policy shows the needfor supplementing these speeches already available to the public by the proposedcollection of documents.7. To sum up, I remain of the opinion that it would be in the national interest to publish this collection of documents. We shall run grave risks ofmisrepresentation, with possibly most unfortunate effects upon Anglo-American,and even Anglo-Soviet, relations, and upon decisions of post-war policy in regardto Germany if we decide to let our case go by default. I therefore recommendthat a decision should now be taken in favour of the publication of these docu-ments. I would suggest that it should be left to my discretion to decide thedate on which publication should take place.,A. E.Foreign Office, August 17, 1942.
