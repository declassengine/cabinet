REPORTof theCOMMITTEE ON AMENITIES AND WELFARECONDITIONSin theTHREE WOMEN&apos;S services to The Right Honourable Winston S. Churchill, C.H., M.P.,Prime Minister.The following report is presented by your Committee on the Women&apos;services:  SECTION I.   THE WOMEN&apos;S SERVICES-RETROSPECT.i. The position of women in the Services to-day is a significant measure of changes both in status and public opinion which have come about during recent years. History has many records of valour and endurance shown by individual women in military operations. But these were heroines of romancewhose activities were regarded as wholly abnormal and remote from aworaaii&apos;s recognised path. Nevertheless, the outbreak of the Great War in1914 found the citadel of Victorian convention challenged and crumbhng.That women should nurse the sick in battle was a principle triumphantlyestablished by Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War; that theyshould enter men&apos;s camps in the capacity of fellow-workers was a positiontaken by assault during the first struggle with Germany.2. In 1916, the growing shortage of manpower led the military authoritiesto consider whether, behind the lines in France, there were not many duties: which might be adequately undertaken by women thus freeing men for activesendee.   Domestic workers, clerks, telegraphists and telephonists, storewomenand motor drivers were the categories first explored. This proposal the first inhistory that women should form an organised corps of workers under officialI auspices for service with the Army met with considerable opposition bothI among civilians and Service men.   Happily, the military authorities persistedland the first draft of the Women&apos;s Army Auxiliary Corps (known subse--quently as Queen Mar)&apos;&apos;s Army Auxiliary Corps) landed in France in March,I1917.  This little detachment of 14 cooks and waitresses were in the van-of a revolutionary experiment, the full consequences of which they littleforesaw.   The W.A.A.Cs., with whom the honour rests of being the pioneers&quot;of the Women&apos;s Services, made good all along the fine.    The fears andsuspicions, to which the presence of women behind the front in France had given rise, died down as the value of women&apos;s work and their excellentlorale was proved by day-to-day experience.3. The Navy and the newly formed Air Force followed where the ArmyJad led. In November, 1917, the Women&apos;s Royal Naval Service was set upio enrol women for work ashore with the Navy, and the Women&apos;s Royal Airforce came into being at the same time as the R.A.F. became a separateforce. After the Armistice, both W.A.A.Cs. and W.R.A.Fs. served with theArmy of Occupation in Germany.j 4. Between 1917 and 1919, more than 100,000 women passed through thelAuxiliary and Volunteer Services, including the Women&apos;s Legion, the Motor
L ^4^transport Corps and the Women&apos;s :F,or,age,;Corps. Of this total, the largest number, opo served in Queen Mary&apos;s Army Auxiliary Corps; about 32,000in the; WbmeiUs&apos;&apos;Royal &quot;Air $bared.1 and between;5,000 and &quot;6,opp (in theWomen&apos;s Royal Naval Servicev    q ^&apos;r:   y ( v5. Peace brought with it demobilisation but the spirit which, had createdthe first \vomen&apos;s auxiliary corps did &apos;hof slumber. The country owes muchto-day to the foresigtlt^Whlindful of.-ex-serviqe women who, without funds and with slender public encouragement^ formed the&apos;mseives&quot;into groups forthe provision of some elementary training in the duties of officers. Theefforts of these women took more concrete form in 1936 when the organisationknown as Emergency Service came into being still on a voluntary basis but with recognition both&apos;from the War Office and the Air Council, EmergencyService being defined as &quot; a voluntary organisation, the purport of which isto train women as officers for any women&apos;s corps that may be employed onduties other than nursing in a national emergency &quot;. During 1937-1938Emergency Service held training courses with official instructors&apos;supplied bythe Services and organised camps for volunteers, among them many women who undertook these duties in the leisure time of their normal work. Some400 potential officers&apos; were thus trained who subsequently! providedvaluable stiffening for the new Auxiliary Services.,6. Meanwhile as the horizon darkened in, Europe the authorities gaveincreased thought to the need that.might arise for the substitution of womenfor men in non-combatant-duties;in the fighting Services. A,decision was arrived; at first, by the. War Office and subsequently by the Air Councilto create two official women&apos;s Forces for. service respectively with the Armyand Air Force: The&apos; Auxiliary Territorial: Service was formed in September,1938, and as its name indicates came into being under the aegis of theTerritorial Army Associations. An-A.T.S. School of Instruction for officers was set up at the Duke of York&apos;s Headquarters in Chelsea. Thirteen courses of 5$ days each were held before the outbreak of war and over 1,000 officerspassed through the school.7. Enrolment of women for duty with the R.A.F. was first undertaken by the A.T.S. but the. desirability of separate and independent organisationssoon became evident and the W.A.A.F. was formed by Royal Warrant inJune, 1939. Meanwhile the Admiralty, f^r similar reasons to those whichhad weighed with the Army and Air Force, had decided to form its ownAuxiliary Service arid to revive : the Women&apos;s Royal Naval Service of theprevious war.8. Women enrolled in the A:T.S. and the W.A.A.F. were subsequentlydeclared by the Defence (Women&apos;s Forces) Regulations, 1941, to be members ofthe armed forces of the Crown.! As such they were eligible for employment oncombatant I duties and arrangements were made to ensure that women werenot required to use lethal weapons unless they volunteered to do so. Untilthe Women&apos;s Forces Regulations came into effect, the: women serving bothin the A.T.S. and W.A.A.F.! had, like their predecessors the W.A.A.Cs.,the technical position of camp followers.9. For the first year of its existence, the A.T.S. was cradled within the framework of the Territorial Associations. Women clerical workers, motordrivers, clerks;: cooks, orderlies and storewomen were enrolled in companieswithin their respective counties. It was left to the President of a TerritorialArmy Association to appoint a woman as County Commandant. She, in turn, was called upon to nominate and enrol junior officers. The country minot at war and the precarious nature of the peace whose sands were runningout had not as yet seized the popular imagination. , In these circumstances, itsnewly formed A.T.S. was regarded as one of many county activities carried
EDOC &quot;5out on a part-time basis by non-professional women with little or no experience0  the exacting demands of war service. The administration was only cen-tralised in the War Office just before the outbreak of war and shortly after theService was re-organised for war conditions in relation to the needs of the Army.The proportion of officers to other ranks was reduced. Changes and retire-ments followed. Direct appointment to the officer rank was abolished and amle laid clown that officers before appointment should serve in the ranks andpass through a cadet course.10. During the first months of the war, the Womeri&apos;s Auxiliary Services were fully occupied with the many administrative tasks which pressed on the Direc-torates. Women had to be enrolled, uniformed, and trained in service pro-cedure no less than in the practical trades for which they had volunteered.Quarters, food, medical attention, all called for organisation. As recruits1 Sowed in, they brought their problems with them. The shortage of trainedofficers presented ever greater difficulties as numbers grew. Little by little,however, the Services got into their respective strides. The experience gained in the administration of the W.A.A.C. during the 1914-1918 war,naturally was of value to those in command, but the new Services developedon much broader lines and presented a much wider field for substitution than any known to the original Corps. The technical skill of women had developedduring the intervening years; so too had their self-confidence. It was no longera question of their employment only as cooks, clerks, orderlies, telephoneoperators and motor drivers. With the ever-growing intensity of the war, thesubstitution of man-power on an increasing scale became a matter of national emergency.Women have now been mobilised as auxiliaries for all branches in the11.Services with the full co-operation of the Navy, Army and Air Force. Thecountry realised, at first with some astonishment, that women were carryingovt delicate and expert duties. They were engaged on operational and semi-operational work on A.A. batteries, on gun sites, on aerodromes and balloonbarrages, in maintenance units and in dockyards. They proved efficientworkers as radio mechanics and operators, wireless mechanics and operators,flight mechanics, instrument mechanics, motor mechanics, sparking plugtesters, draughtswomen, coders, signallers, plotters, photographers, on radiolocation and in the handling of projectors, range and height finders. Duringthe Battle of Britain there were many examples of courage and heroism shown by the auxiliaries. Their coolness under fire and attention to duty duringheavy air raids forged new links of sympathy and understanding with the menalongside whom they worked.12. The rapid expansion of the Services had been accompanied by a large,if inevitable, measure of improvisation. Accommodation, clothing, equip-rnent, had all to be supplied under conditions of considerable difficulty due to ashortage of labour and materials. Officers new to their responsibilities had tocarry out duties for which they were imperfectly trained. There was for atime discomfort in some units, confusion in others, deficiencies aggravated byvery severe weather. Rumours derogatoiy to the Services began to circulate,j Sometimes they took the form of concrete charges about bad conditions, some-times of vague accusations about drink and immorality. Growing uneasinesswas shown by parents as these stories gathered force and volume by repetition.13. In order to reassure public opinion, the Minister of Labour and NationalService, during the passage of the National Service (No. 2) Act, gave an under-taking on 4th December, 1941, that the question of amenities and other facili-g     for women in the Auxiliary Services would be reviewed immediately byIhimself and the Ministers of the Service Departments.   A proposal to set up a* Committee of the Parliamentary Secretaries to the Admiralty, War Office,21319 A 2
Air Ministry and Ministry of Labour and National Service, to consider condi-tions in the Women&apos;s Services did not meet with the approval of the House ofCommons. After a deputation to the Lord Privy Seal on ioth February1942, it was announced in the House on 24th February that a Committee ofmen and women had been appointed with the following terms of reference&quot; to enquire into and report on the amenities and welfare conditions in thethree Women&apos;s Services and to make recommendations &quot;.SECTION II.-SCOPE OF ENQUIRY.14. Your Committee have regarded these terms as covering a wide field.We took the view that the essentials for welfare are:  (1) Definite minimum standards of accommodation, warmth, food,medical attention and hygiene.(2) Good leadership by efficient and understanding officers.(3) Full utilisation of individual capacity so far as the exigencies ofthe Services permit.(4) Encouragement from home and from the general public.The maintenance of morale depends on the fulfilment of these conditions ifwomen are to make their maximum contribution to the national effort. Butthe State has also to ensure that due provision is made for religion, education,and the proper use of leisure time.15. Your Committee have, therefore, made a survey of accommodation,health and hygiene, selection and training of officers, intake and posting,arrangements for leave and transit, educational and recreational facilities,religion, general morale and standards of conduct. In the course of theenquiry we have examined the administration of the three Women&apos;s Services,the functions of women officers and the use made of woman power so far aswell-being, of personnel in the Forces is affected.16. The establishment of the Committee was given considerable publicity.The Press took up the question of complaints and 364 letters were received.In view of the number of women in the Forces, these letters did not point to widespread discontent with service conditions and it must also be notedthat they related to a period of rapid expansion in inclement weather. It may,of course, be argued that this small number did not represent the fullvolume of discontent since service women must lodge complaints throughofficial channels. In the main the letters were from parents who did not desire that action should be taken on specific cases, but who were anxiousto bring certain general conditions to the notice of the Committee. the correspondence served a useful purpose in directing attention to alleged weak-nesses and a number of the camps referred to by the correspondents were included in the itinerary of visits.17. Your Committee have held 34 meetings. We have taken evidence fromthe Women Directors of the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the WomensAuxiliary Air Force and the Deputy Director and the Superintendent of personnel of the Women&apos;s Royal Naval Service; the Medical Director Generalsof the Army and Air Force, and the Woman Medical Adviser to the MedicalDirector General of the Navy; the Directors of Welfare for the Army andthe Air Force; the Director of Manning at the Air Ministry; and the AdjutantGeneral, War Office. We have also taken evidence from the Ministry ofLabour and National Service.18. We have had statements and examined representatives of the followingvoluntary ofganisations: Church Army, Church of England Moral WelfareCouncil, the Church of Scotland Committee on Christian Life and Social
2Work, the Churches Committee for Women Serving with H.M. Forces,Lord Hortler&apos;s Standing Conference, the Association for Moral and SocialHygiene, the Salvation Army, Soldiers&apos;, Sailors&apos; and Airmen&apos;s Help Society,Women&apos;s Voluntary Services, Y.W.C.A., and a special committee of the\Vomen&apos;s Liberal Federation which had been dealing with the Services. Inaddition, we have had written statements from other Associations and manyindividual interviews with responsible men and women of varied experience.a number of complainants and their relatives have also been interviewed aswell as other persons interested in the well-being of the Forces. information on many aspects of service conditions has also been obtained through numer-ous personal contacts.iq. Members of your Committee have visited 123 camps and stations indifferent parts of the country where women are engaged. We have taken across section of the three Services and samples of every type of station inEngland, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. These have includedtraining schools for N.C.0s. and Officers, and Service hospitals. We havealso called at railway stations to see the travelling arrangements for women and the accommodation available for those waiting for trains.SECTION III.-DIFFICULTIES OF SERVICE LIFE.20. Your Committee examine in a later section the careless talk currentabout immorality in the Services and show on what slender foundations suchinjurious generalisations rest. Criticism of another type concerned withdiscipline, accommodation, food and medical attention stands in a different category, and information on these points reached the Committee from reliablesources.21. For many women as for men, the first few months of Service life are difficult and irksome. Homesickness, lack of privacy, and the first experienceof drill and discipline, all tend to disturb the recruit. In particular, the girlfrom the sheltered home, who has not known the hardships of daily work in office, shop or factory, may find it difficult to make the necessary adjustments.The large majority adapt themselves in time and many become enthusiasticfor their Service. But a certain number will always find community lifeuncongenial and, when writing home, may easily exaggerate existing draw-backs or discomforts.22. Your Committee in the course of their work have inspected naval,military and air units of all sizes and types. We are very sensible of the limitations under which these inspections were made. Though every facilitywas placed at our disposal by the authorities and we were free to go to anycamp or place we indicated, surprise visits to Service establishments are notpossible in war time. An announced visit gives time for cleaning up, a fact which naturally favours the slack unit. In these circumstances, the revealingelement of the unexpected is lacking and the visitor is left guessing as toany possible discrepancy between the unit as seen and its daily unofficialD appearance. Within these limitations we frequently asked to see variousbuildings and accommodation which were not part of the arranged programme and made a point of leaving officers and of having talks alone with the rank and file. These conversations often proved useful and informative. Visits weremade in Spring and Summer so that generally we saw the stations under themost favourable conditions but we made allowance for this fact and tried tovisualise what living conditions would be in wet and wintry weather.23. It was clear after a time, however, to your Committee that there was,broadly speaking, a common pattern in accommodation to which Serviceorganisation conformed, and that, with variations above or below the standard,
that same pattern repeated itself whether the accommodation provided were inbarracks, hutted camps, married quarters, requisitioned houses or billetsVariations in comfort and convenience are considerable, according to theresources of an area where for reasons of national defence the governingfactor it is necessary to place a Service unit.24. The standard of accommodation laid down for Service women is, insome respects, better than that for the men. Your Committee were told inmany places that the soldiers accepted this better standard for the auxiliariesnot only without resentment but with active goodwill. The soldiers, whosometimes were called upon to vacate comfortable barracks for less attractivequarters, often helped the women by constructing paths and the provision of minor comforts they had not troubled to provide for themselves. Anydifferentiation in standard between the sexes is a delicate matter and your committee think it is one that the women themselves would not wish to emphasize.25. A woman who elects to serve with the Armed Forces voluntarily acceptsa rougher and more adventurous career than the woman in civilian life. Com-pensation for physical hardship is found in closer association with the war effort and the comradeship which obtains in a well-run camp. But theauxiliaries of to-day are the wives and mothers of the future and satisfactory as is the standard of health in the Services, no one desires to apply a whole-sale hardening process to the young women who are serving their countryeffectively and well. Your Committee feel that the minimum standard to beapplied to the auxiliaries may be termed one of Spartan decency, and theyhold that Spartan decency implies the provision of reasonable accommodation,cleanliness, warmth, adequate food properly cooked and served and satis-factory medical attention. It was by this standard that they judged conditionsabout which complaints had reached them.Complaints by Correspondence.26. Letters from parents had spoken of hard conditions under which theirdaughters lived during the winter months. Many of these letters were writtennot so much in the individual as in the public interest and their tone was generally unexceptional. But there was a definite time lag in most of this correspondence between the date of the circumstances recounted and com-munication with the Committee. The complaints referred in the main to theA.T.S. and the W.A.A.F. Very few were received in respect of the W.R.N.S.this being a comparatively small Sen-ice which had not been subjected to the strain of rapid and large scale expansion. Large scale improvisation in theA.T.S. and the W.A.A.F. was inevitable in the early days, and there was nobackground of experience and a stiffening of old hands to help the newcomers.Sometimes huts or barracks were bleak and uncomfortable: sometimes officers had little more experience than the ranks they controlled : sometimes failures inthe human element aggravated conditions which a more understanding leader-ship would have made tolerable. The standard of Spartan decency does not imply continued acquiescence in damp and dirty quarters, monotonous andbadly cooked food, absence of reasonable warmth in severe weather, and ofindifferent attention in the sick bay. Any one of these defects may be tem-porary, due to a breakdown in organisation, to accident, or to the unforeseen,hardships of the war. If your Committee enumerate them it is through no desire to stress the failures of the past, but to strike a note of warning for thefuture. Times of pressure may recur and with them the possibility of the oldmistakes in a new form. Ranks are swift to sense inefficiency, carelessness ora;: imperfect-sense of duty in officers (especially the latter) and when bad con-ditions are treated with complacency or tend to become stabilised, discontent
202spreads like ripples on a pond. After a careful review of the circumstances,your Committee find, therefore, tiiat there was justification at the time formany of the complaints that reached them regarding the A.T.S. and theW.A.A.F. But while fully recognising the hardships endured, we must also,in justice to the authorities, draw attention to certain causes concerned with thewar which inevitably led to drawback and discomfort during the winter of1941 and 1942.Strain involved by expansion of Services.27. It is difficult for the general public to realise the strain created by the..reat expansion of these two women&apos;s Services built up as they have beenhi less than three years from almost non-existent foundations. Provision madefor accommodation and equipment on a large scale was inadequate. Abovef&apos;&quot; all the supply of officers had to be evolved and maintained under circumstancesof acute pressure. The over-riding condition in war-time is the national needand the exigencies, of a country fighting for its life resulted in temporary condi-tions of real hardship for women volunteers. Substitution became a pressingproblem at an early date and the intake of women overflowed the means ofdealing with them on lines of normal comfort. Contracts were held up owingto shortages of both workers and material: drafts were sent to half-constructedcamps with huts still waiting completion and imperfectly supplied with light and heat. To these drawbacks were added those entailed by a winter of excep-tional severity, mud and frost alternately contributing to the trials of themoment. Last, but not least, a large proportion of officers were young andinexperienced and without knowledge of how to deal with difficult adminis-trative problems which might well have tried the wisdom of men with years ofService training.28. That these conditions resulted in well justified complaints is not sur-prising; surprise may indeed be felt that their volume was not much greater.To-day the situation is different. Great efforts have !been made during recent months to remedy deficiencies that pressed severely on all concerned. your committee have paid personal visits to many units about &quot;which complaintshad reached them. We found that, in the large majority of such places, thegrounds of complaint had been dealt with during the interval and the accom-modation now reached a reasonable, and sometimes a high, standard. Accom-modation varies greatly in character&apos; and quality and its standards are determined by location and war needs. Women doing important work on aremote site have to be housed in the best accommodation available and thebest may be poor. Your Committee throughout this Report must repeatedlystress the point that during a war the Naval, Military and Air Forces have toput up from time to time with conditions which the national emergency alonemakes tolerable. We do not, however, find that hardships or rough conditionsare resented on the operational sites; on the contrary, they are willinglyaccepted by women who feel, when serving guns and balloons and radio-location, that they come near the actual war and that they are playing their part in the struggle. It is the boredom of non-operational units in old-fashioned barracks or uncomfortable quarters which is a more potent source of discontent than real hardship. Here, as elsewhere, everything turns onthe officer. An officer whose first care is her platoon or company will fightand struggle for the welfare of her women at all times and in all places.Such an officer, by her zeal, unselfishness and good sense can make theroughest conditions acceptable. Grumbling does not arise over temporaryconditions, however hard, which the girls instinctively feel are part andparcel of the war. But if an officer is indifferent or unsympathetic, the tonedeteriorates and complaints mount up even in the best and most modern of accommodation.
food.29. Complaints about food, when justified, are a serious reflection on theofficer in charge of a unit. All bad food is waste and inefficiency and, apartfrom accident due to some breakdown in supplies or kitchen equipment, points to careless and slovenly management. It is essential to the health and well-being of the Services that from the ample stores available a balanced andappetising diet should be provided. A good administrator will further see toit that meals are properly served and eaten in seemly fashion no matter at what hour of the day or night these have to be taken. Here, as elsewhere,if the officer fails a good plan on paper will break down. Members of theCommittee have been present on many occasions when meals were served.Standards in these as in other matters have varied but we are glad to say wehave frequently had occasion to praise the quality of the food. In cookerymatters, however, there can be no sitting back for anyone concerned and ahigh and still higher standard should always be aimed at. Food may not bebady cooked and yet prove heavy and monotonous. Cookery as one of thefine arts unfortunately has never stirred the imagination of the British public.But it offers great scope for ingenuity and talent with results which redoundto national health and comfort.30. We think that a special tribute is due to the work of the cooks andorderlies who carry out duties, the importance of which is perhaps not fully recognised by themselves or the general public. Work in the cook-house is continuous and often heavy. At times of pressure in a campthe hours may be long . There is still a shortage of cooks which increases the pressure on the staff and many places we visited were below establishment.Peeling potatoes and washing up dishes are commonplace duties which may seem remote from the war effort. Few tasks, however, are more intimatelyconcerned with its success. The health and physique of the fighting forcesdepend in the first instance on the quality of the food supplied to them. Theold adage that an army fights on its stomach is one of profound truth. Cooksand orderlies serve at a key point in the present struggle, for content ordiscontent in the ranks is largely determined by their efforts. We think that officers in charge of a camp should constantly seek to impress this view notonly on the domestic personnel but on all other ranks who owe so much totheir service, remembering that all work ranks the same according to thespirit in which it is performed.minor ailments.31. The treatment of minor ailments has caused your Committee some un-easiness. Frequent complaints are made about medical parades and the trialsof girls who have to get up when feeling ill to attend them. It is alleged thatwaiting rooms are not always provided or that the patient may have to stand for a long period in a draughty passage. The opposite complaint exists ofnegligence to visit the girl in her barrack room, or more particularly in herbillet, where she may be left unattended for many hours. It is very difficult for your Committee to sift the facts about such charges. Many complaints oneven a preliminary investigation by letter have proved worthless; others, how-ever, have been maintained. How far, when proved to be true, they toobelong to the past of pressure and difficulty, we find it hard to say.32. The same arrangements are laid down in every unit, and in theory areadmirable. The girl, if she feels ill, reports to the N.C.O. in charge of theroom where she sleeps. The N.C.O. takes her temnerature and if it is abovenormal she remains in bed till seen by the medical; c ii-cer. After his visit shemay be removed either to the sick bay or to hospii- i.   Many auxiliaries have
sharply challenged the statement that this procedure, excellent in itself, is always carried out. It is claimed that medical parades often lead to sufferingand discomfort. The 100 per cent, efficiency of regulations .is not alwaysmatched by the 100 per cent, efficiency of human personnel, and your Com-mittee cannot believe that all complaints on this subject which have reachedthem are without foundation. We urge, therefore, that Commanding officers should, as a matter of routine, constantly review sickness arrangements amongauxiliaries under their command and take steps to ensure that any rules laiddown are strictly enforced. It should be the special duty of a woman officer,to whose company the sick person belongs, to see that she receives promptmedical attention. Special vigilance is needed when a girl reporting sick is inbillets or on a remote site.33. We are concerned over the arrangements which obtain in respect of food for &quot;iris suffering from minor ailments. It appears that they are served withthe ordinary daily ration which may be quite unsuitable. Sausage and mashand roly poly pudding may be excellent in themselves but unsuitable for any-one suffering from a sick headache. Complaints are also made that girlsallowed to stay in their own quarters for a temporary indisposition have to getup to obtain their food. Some arrangements are clearly necessary for seeing that girls who are indisposed are served with suitable food. We are told thatinvalid preparations are available and it is a failure in organisation if they arenot provided in suitable cases.34. Your Committee must again repeat that Service conditions during a warcannot reproduce the comfort and convenience of peace-time. But it rests withwomen officers, whose primary concern is well-being, to do all in their power tosee that such conditions are not aggravated unnecessarily through failure in the human element.Attitude of Parents.35. An important factor in the maintenance of morale in the Services is theattitude of the parents. Home life is deeply rooted and most families find ita hardship to part from sons and daughters. Nothing, however, is more dis-heartening to a homesick girl in the first days of an unfamiliar existence than tohave letters from home full of parental anxiety and distress. This leads todivided loyalties: the girl is torn between duty to her parents and duty towardsthe Service and her morale inevitably suffers. On the other hand some girlsare apt to exaggerate the hardships they are enduring often a harmless formoi boasting which a wise parent will know how to discount. For the most partparents will find that when their girls come home on leave they have developedpoise and have improved in health and spirits since joining the Forces. there could be no better proof that the well-being and efficiency of recruits is a matterof concern to the Service they have joined.SECTION IV-ADMINISTRATION.Headquarters.36. The functions of the A.T.S. and W.A.A.F. are respectively laid down inArmy Council Instructions and Air Ministry Orders. The W.R.N.S. have nosuch Charter and are not included in the Defence (Women&apos;s Forces) Regula-tions, 1941; and women enrolled in this Force are not members of the armed forces of the Crown nor are they subject to the Naval Discipline Act. Theyare officially stated to be an integral part of the existing Naval organisation.It would seem desirable for the W.R.N.S. to be brought under the defence regulations, not so much from the point of view of discipline, as for uniformity of status.   An endeavour should also be made to ensure that as many basic
principles as possible an; adhered to in all three Services, and in particular,uniform standards laid down for recruitment, accommodation, clothing, dis-ciplinary powers and scales of punishment.37. The A.T.S. and W.A.A.F. have expanded at a very rapid rate and tovery considerable proportions. As a whole, the administrations made an unsatisfactory start by having to deal, without adequate preparation, with very many more recruits and many more categories dtan they could absorb-. Condi-tions, however, have improved substantially of late. The establishment of theW.R.N.S. is less than a third of each of the other two Services. The W.R.N.S.too are expanding but hold firmly to the principle of more gradual growth.38. The organisation of Headquarters is different in all three Corps. In theWar Office there is more decentralisation than in the Air Ministry. In theAdmiralty a greater degree of power in respect of the conditions of theW.R.N.S. is vested in their Director and her department seems to be moreself-contained than in the other two Services.39. The War Office organisation seems to be working satisfactorily, thoughstill further delegation of duties might be possible. That of the Air Ministryappears to us to tend to over-centralisation in view of the rapid expansion ofthe W.A.A.F. The delegation of more responsibility within the ministry should be considered. W.A.A.F. staff officers should, for instance, beappointed to such directorates as deal with matters affecting the W.A.A.F. asadvisers to the directorates and for liaison with Commands and the organisa-tion brought more into line with that obtaining in the War Office. As regardsthe W.R.N.S., the directorate appears to be meetiing its comparatively smallrequirements well, and it is doubtful whether it should be modified to makeit conform in a greater degree to the other two.40. The question has been raised as to whether the actual function and responsibilities of the three Women Directors should not be made more widely known. The public regard them as Commanders-in-Chief of their Servicesand it may be that the parents of girls in the Army, Navy and Air Forcelike to think that a woman is finally responsible for their well-being andnot a Government Department. This impression is only partially correct.Final authorit)&apos; is not vested in the Women Directors. They form part of the  general heirarchy of their respective Services and their Headquarters.They are concerned with all questions of the well-being and efficiency in their services and can advise other Service Directors on matters falling within their respective spheres of responsibility. There are additional safeguards for ensuring that representations by the Women Directors on matters speci-fically affecting women&quot;s interests receive consideration at higher levels. Thereare, however, marked differences between the organisation of the three direc-torates, their relations with other directorates and the degree of responsibilityvested in the Women Directors.41. Inspection is carried out in the A.T.S. by four women inspectors onthe staff of the Director, A.T.S. In the Directorate W.A.A.F. there is noinspectorate as such but there are four special welfare officers who haverecently been appointed and who visit stations and report on well-being. Weurge that close liaison should be maintained between these officers and the directorate for Air Force welfare. In addition there is in the DirectorateW.A.A.F. a number of staff officers who specialise on certain phases of work.e.g. training, and who act as liaison officers with the appropriate directorates.They visit stations and in addition to reviewing the work which is their special responsibility, they report on all matters affecting the well-being ofthe women. We have seen reports for both Services and think the work isinvaluable. The number of inspectors in the A.T.S. seems to be undulylow and should be increased,- especially in view of the increasing numbers
of women in mixed heavy anti-aircraft batteries. In the W.R.N.S. the work is carried out by the Director, the Deputy Director and by Superintendentsfrom Command Headquarters. We think that Women Directors and theirDeputies should be free to visit stations without prior noice.Postings.42. Record Offices have dealt direct with units of the A.T.S. and theW.A.A.F. and have carried out postings and cross postings of the rank and file. We understand that this procedure has been relaxed in respect ofthe A.T.S. and that a certain number of postings are now being done byGroups. The advantage of the centralised procedure is in knowing the pictureas a whole, but it is for consideration whether cross postings and other detailed work might not largely be delegated to Commands and Groups. The crossshifting of &quot; bodies &quot; which takes place often appears incomprehensible tothe persons concerned and delegation, when possible, to Commands and toGroups would save expense and ensure more personal consideration of individual needs when changes have become necessary.43. In the W.R.N.S. all postings, drafting and selection of officers andratings are under the Woman Directors control, and Superintendents arethe drafting authorities for ratings in Commands.44. The policy of posting near home and the difficulties to which it gives rise are dealt with in detail in Section XI. We have also heard of postingsabove establishment and of rank and file being sent to Commands withoutrequest from the Command or any prior notification by Records. The ex-explanation given for this action is that the Services must hold a pool of trainedwomen for the opening up of new camps. We have had, however, evidenceof the confusion and difficulties created by this procedure, especially in thematter of accommodation and we deprecate drafts being moved without prior notice to a reception area.Unemployed Reserve List and Discharges.45. We understand that the procedure laid down for the A.T.S. both inregard to the Unemployed Reserve List and for discharges on compassionate grounds has been abused and that the wastage under these heads has been much larger than in the W.A.A.F. in which sanction lies with the Air ministry and not Commands. To reduce this wastage in the A.T.S. and to straightenout the position the Air Ministry policy is now being adopted and the powersconcentrated in the War Office.Commands.46. Here again there are considerable differences between the systems of thethree Services In the A.T.S. the organisation is mainly regional, that is by army Command Areas, which we understand are now being sub-divided intocompact Army Corps and Army Districts. It would seem desirable that inaddition to the A.T.S. officer at Command Headquarters there should be a staff officer at each Corps and District Headquarters and the units organisedwithin these formations. The Deputy Director A.T.S. at Command Head-quarters would act, as now, as adviser to that Headquarters. There is onefunctional command in the Army which is absorbing large numbers of women-the Anti-Aircraft Command where A.T.S. are incorporated in mixed heavyanti-aircraft batteries.47. In the W.A.A.F. the organisation conforms to the functional organisa-tion of the Royal Air Force, which has many advantages from the operational
point of view and we realise the merits of administration conforming to opera-tion. This, however, entails the responsibility of the Senior W.A.A.F. officersCommand and Group, extending over a very wide area. One group, f0^instance, extends from the North of Scotland to the South of England. It \vjijbe appreciated that a system of this type entails a large expenditure of timeand money on travelling. As women group officers are concerned only withwell-being, the question arises whether it is necessary to maintain the functionalorganisation in their work. A woman group officer in charge of the well-bein&quot;of all W.A.A.F. units within a given geographical area would appear to be amore economical arrangement than the present system. We appreciate thatthe Commands might disapprove of this suggestion as cutting across theirrespective functional controls, but as the visiting woman group officer would be concerned not with policy but with questions of accommodation and welfarewhich conform to common standards for all units alike, we think this suggestionmight be examined by the Air Ministry. On some large stations, as we have seen, more than one Command may be represented, and that two or morewomen group officers should travel, often very long distances from different parts of the country, to deal with the welfare of adjoining groups of womenappears to us a wasteful procedure and one that calls for review.Unit Organisation.48. All three Services have women officers employed either in substitutioafor male officers on technical and other duties, or acting as administrative officers whose chief duties are concerned with well-being.  In the W.R.N.S. thelatter may do some administration work but their main duty is to look afterthe well-being of their women.   A section of these officers live with the Wrenexcept in very small quarters, and are not only in charge of catering and houshold management but are responsible for the welfare of the women off duty andthe organisation of leisure time activities.   Administrative officers in the A.T.Sdo pay, messing, kitting, barrack stores, etc., as well as looking after the wellbeing of their women.   The W.A.A.F. administrative officers specialise inwell-being; the other duties just mentioned being the responsibility of thR.A.F. Station Commander and his staff.49. The organisation of units raises some important questions. broadly speaking, we find that there are two systems the &quot; component &quot; system sucias obtains in the W.A.A.F. personnel working with the R.A.F., and in national.T.S. personnel working with mixed heavy anti-aircraft batteries; and tit&quot; self-contained &quot; system which comprises the bulk of the A.T.S. personnelengaged on general duties. In the W.A.A.F., and in the operational units0!the mixed heavy anti-aircraft batteries, the women form part of the establishment of the unit (the R.A.F. in the one case and the Royal Regiment 0!Artillery in the other), and the administration duties mentioned above (pay,messing, kitting, barrack stores, etc.) are done for the whole unit by one sete!officers and N.C.Os. On the other hand where the A.T.S. are working on;self-contained basis, the auxiliaries are not on the establishment of the unit and administration duties for the women are carried on by the officers of.tilA.T.S., while parallel duties are carried on by the men.50. Your Committee have given much thought to this question which raisetwo considerations, the over-riding consideration of national efficiency and 02only less important that of the well-being of a large body of women, liappears to us that it is not to be solved by a categorical &quot; either/or&quot;faevery section of the A.T.S. Conditions vary, and the system to be adopts!should be the best for the type of unit concerned. The Army is very unlikelyin the future to provide a permanent career for women and since the preset&apos;position can only be temporary, some solution has to be found which wl
economise man power, transport and other matters and at the same timesafeguard the well-being of the auxiliaries.-i Your Committee think that .not only in heavy mixed anti-aircraftbatteries but in large static units, where substantial numbers of women areployed, the component system, i.e. a joint establishment for soldiersntl auxiliaries, avoids duplication of function and leads to economy in personnel. In large units A.T.S. officers freed from administration duties would be able to concentrate on well-being, and a number could be substitutedfor men and used for administration work within the units. With a jointestablishment duties-ean be allocated as most convenient. We are told, forinstance, that, in some heavy mixed anti-aircraft batteries, the A.T.S. officer in addition to her special well-being duties often carries on general work likemessing or pay for the whole battery. We think this development sound andwould &quot;welcome its extension. Where small and scattered groups of women are concerned, convenience and economy must dictate the type of organisa-tion, and whether such groups of A.T.S. should be attached to a neighbour-in&quot; establishment or remain self-contained. Where the component systemj. Applied your Committee stress the importance of strengthening and supple-menting the normal channels of communication, so that the women&apos;s interests are not only adequately safeguarded but that any questions specifically affect-in&quot; women&apos;s well-being can be dealt with promptly by their women officersand, when necessary, referred to higher A.T.S. authority. A.T.S. disciplinaryprocedure should remain as at present.52. In mixed heavy anti-aircraft batteries, A.T.S. are already working aspart of the unit under the direct orders of the officer commanding thebattery. These batteries are absorbing large numbers of women and a high proportion of women officers. We think, therefore, there should be very close liaison with the Director, A.T.S., on all matters concerned with women&apos;interests. To this end we recommend that the Deputy Director, A.T.S., of anti-Aircraft Command should be a member of the Director&apos;s Council.53. It is significant that under pressure of circumstances the merging of establishments in certain units has already taken place. We see advantages in this course and think that with proper safeguards the identity of &quot;the A.T.S.as a Women&apos;s Service can be preserved, while furthering the best interestsof the nation as a whole by the resulting economies. The identity of theW.A.A.F. as a corporate body is in no sense impaired by the integrationsystem under which it works. Officers and other ranks in the A.T.S. should in our opinion continue to be recruited and enrolled as at present. Weunderstand that any substantial modifications in A.T.S. procedure would call for amendment of the Army Council instruction under which the Service atpresent functions.54. In our opinion consideration should be given to the replacement in theNavy, Army and Air Force of male officers, to a greater extent than at present,by officers of equivalent rank of the Women&apos;s Services in the three government  Departments, Command and other static headquarters, and in such branches inl the Army as the Royal Army Service Corps, Royal Army Pay Corps and theirequivalents in the other Services..55. In the W.A.A.F. where there are two or more units the grading of the woman officer is determined by the number in each unit separately and notI by the aggregate number at the station.     If, therefore, there are 350 in1 one unit and 400 in another, each unit is in charge of a Flight Officer.   one  station on a location with 750 women would carry a Squadron Officer.   there is need, where there is more than one unit, for one woman officer to take responsibility for the well-being of all the women and to report to the;officer in command of the station.   Here grading should be determined
SECTION V.-OFFICERS.Shortage of Officers.56. The standard of officers is improving but much remains to be done assufficient and efficient officers are the key of a good service. Improvement ishandicapped by the fact that all three Services are seriously short of officersand owing to constant expansion there is little time for the extra trainingrequired. In addition the A.A. batteries act as a heavy drain on existingnumbers in the A.T.S. and women are now being used, and we hope will bestill more used in the future, as substitutes for Staff Captains, Flight Lieutenantsand Naval Officers at the War Office, Air Ministry, Admiralty and the Head-quarters of Commands, Groups and shore establishments. It is most import-ant that the shortage should speedily be made good and the wastage coveredplus a margin.   There would seem to be three courses open:  (1) Further recruitment from within the ranks of the Service concerned;(2) Further recruitment of women with specialist qualifications for emergency commissions; and(3) To undertake more active propaganda through the AppointmentsOffices of the Ministry of Labour and National Service with the help ofthe University Appointments Boards and the Services to bring to the forethe need for good officer material and to give publicity to a policy ofaccelerated promotion for suitable candidates.57. As regards commissions from the ranks, a comb-out was started latelyamongst the A.T.S. motor drivers, among whom large numbers should beavailable. There is good officer material in the ranks and we have been impressed by the high standard of many of rite N.C.Os. we have met and theexcellent work they are doing. Not every woman is anxious to transfer fromthe ranks even when the opportunity presents itself. Some first rate N.C..Os.prefer their present duties and more personal contacts with the rank and file.Competent N.C.Os. are all important to the morale of a unit but valuablethough they and their services are in their present position, we hope thatcommissioning from this source will be energetically continued in the A.T.S.and&apos;W.A.A.F. The W.R.N.S. too are trying to get more and more officers from amongst their ratings. Every encouragement should be given to suitablemembers of the rank and file to take up commissions. No questions as to financial position should be put by selection boards nor should the expenseto be incurred on taking up a commission be such as to act as a deterrent.Messing fees should conform, as far as possible, to a general standard.58. All three Services have a system of registration of women with special qualifications for commissions but the numbers recruited by this means arecomparatively small. The A.T.S. have used this system to the greatestextent through the A.T.S. Section of the Army Officers&apos;. Emergency Reserve.The W.A.A.F. limit such recruitment to persons with specialist qualifications for radio location, meteorology, and intelligence.according to the total number of women on the station. In the W.A.A.F.we have found camps where the number of officers in charge at the time ofour visit seemed unduly low. Officer cadres have been fixed on originalestablishment which may actually have been much exceeded over a long period. Difficulties of accommodation, furnishing and equipment are alwaysaccentuated when personnel is sent in excess of establishment and carefuloversight by women officers is the more necessary. The number of womenofficers should, therefore, as far as possible, be related to the actual personnel of the W.A.A.F. on a station.
206en. As, however, it is unlikely that the numbers required can be quicklyobtained by means of the above two channels we think it advisable that theuse of the Appointments Offices of the -Ministry of Labour and National service should be extended. These offices are already being used by the A.T.S. andthe VV.R.N.S. for the enrolment of women suitable for officers. We are ofopinion that there should be special publicity to attract suitable women ofoood qualifications, who otherwise might be afraid that under the presentsystem they would be lost in the ranks for the duration of the war. It mustbe made clear to candidates that there can be no promise of a commissionbut we think that, in view of die good promotion prospects for women already in the ranks, publicity should be given to a procedure which would provide forwomen of a special type to be interviewed by selected Service recruiters at the appointments Offices of the Ministry of Labour and National Service. Thesecandidates would be assessed from the point of view of potential officermaterial and if considered satisfactory by the interviewer, would go into the ranks for a probationary period with the prospect of accelerated promotionshould their work justify such promotion. This procedure must be safe-guarded from any allegation of nepotism. We suggest that the essentialqualifications for women of this category should be any woman of good person-ality capable in her own sphere domestic, industrial, business or professional_recommended from an authoritative and independent source, and studentswith not less than a year at a University.recommended by the Head of theirCollege.Youth of Officers and Age of Retirement.60. The general impression made by administrative officers of the service as a whole is one of youth though this impression is not confirmed bystatistics. We welcome the responsibilities given to young people and wehave often been struck during our visits to camps with the zeal and efficiencythey are showing in their work. We think, however, it is desirable that olderwomen should also share in the duties of the Services. Age in itself is nocriterion of a good or bad officer; the ideal is to have a mixture of olderand younger age groups of the right type. Difficult personal problems notinfrequently arise and sometimes call for more experience of life than a young girl can be expected to have. Especially on remote sites and isolatedunits there are advantages in the presence of an older woman. It may be valuable for young officers, who show special abilities, to be given a smallindependent charge but as a general rule we think older and more experiencedofficers should be sent to remote sites where the officer has a high degree ofresponsibility for the welfare of the auxiliaries under her command. we hope such women will be recruited by the procedure set out above, as wellas the younger girl from university and home. Otherwise the call up of age groups under the National Service Acts on the basis of the youngest first will,as time goes on, intensify the problem. The shortage of officers is acute andthe Services are not in a position to part with any good material through an age limit operating mechanically. The vast majority of women officers are concerned with well-being and have no operational duties. consequently the considerations which dictate an early age of retirement for officers in theMen&apos;s Forces, who potentially are all operational, do not apply in theWomen&apos;s Services. We think, in view of these facts, that the retirement ageof the A.T.S. and the W.A.A.F. has been fixed on the low side and thatit should be raised to 55 for Chief Commanders and officers below in theA.T.S. and equivalent ranks in the W.A.A.F. with the proviso that in specialcircumstances officers of all ranks can be retained to 60 if desirable in thenational interest. There is no fixed age of retirement for officers in theW.R.N.S. We think that the principle set out above should apply also tothem.
Training of Officers.61. Your Committee have visited various centres and schools where officersand N.C.Os. in the Women&apos;s Forces are trained. We realise the vast amountof technical detail concerned with Service administration which has to becrowded into a brief period. Necessarily the instruction is given by specialistsin Service technique who are not educationalists in the wider sense. Owincto the shortage of officers and the urgent need to increase their numbers, thetime allotted to the course is cut down to a minimum. We appreciate thedifficulty and that the authorities naturally feel that first things come firstin the matter of Service requirements. We cannot, however, report that theposition is, in our opinion, satisfactory. Your Committee considers thatthe lack of any wider educational element is a drawback in the existingcurricula for officers. Women officers, other than technical officers, haveno operational duties and necessarily their work and training in the services is confined to a more limited sphere than that of the men. To broaden this general outlook within that more limited sphere is, therefore, of great im-portance to their general efficiency.62. We think that too much time is devoted to factual instruction in Servicetechnique which could be acquired from written instructions and learned by experience. Women officers have to handle human beings and the many problems they present, no less than questions concerned with pay, quarters,messing, military law, etc. To care for their women properly is the primaryduty, and it is, in our opinion, essential that their general service training should be organised so as to fit them for carrying out this task. knowledge and understanding of human nature cannot be taught in a six weeks&apos; course,but training should provide for contacts with older and maturer minds who can open up vistas of thought previously unrealised and unexplored.63. We attach great importance to the need for broadening the mentalhorizon of the Forces, and we stress in Section XIV the opportunity that service life presents for the spreading in the ranks of interest in currentaffairs. But the help and enthusiasm of the officers must first be mobilisedif full advantage is to be taken of this opportunity. Without their co-operationoutside efforts can only hope for a limited success. The success of the Servicedepends on the intelligence and breadth of view of the officer. If officers have a lively appreciation of the issues, national, international and civic,which underlie the war effort and will be of importance in the future, theycan in turn rouse some similar appreciation among the women in their charge.64. Provision is already made in the curricula of O.C.T.Us. for outsidelecturers drawn from Headquarters, Commands and Universities. In ouropinion more time should be given to this aspect of the training of cadets.No question of detailed study arises or can arise in the time available.The aim of the lecturer should be thought-provoking, the rousing of intellectualcuriosity. This may take many forms; sometimes an introduction to somemasterpiece in literature or art, sometimes an appreciation of history, some-times an experience of travel which life an unknown part of the map, sometimes the obligations of civic duty. The whole point of such an address should be that at its end the audience are keen to go and find out more about the subject for themselves. Short of this the lecture has failed.Civilian tutors and lecturers from the Universities and from the regional commitees of the Central Advisory Council can be drawn upon for thispurpose, but in pilot addresses personality and experience are of the first importance, and the sendees of responsible speakers should also be enlisted whounderstand and sympathise with young people and can hold their attention.Not every teacher is a tutor, and academic qualifications of die first rank can
unfortunately be combined with a complete incapacity either to expound a subject or to raise enthusiasm in an adult audience. If these wider valuesare to be got across to officers and other ranks alike, the teacher must be amissionary and an inspired type of missionary. It is the business of theofficer to lead not to teach, but officers must first have caught the fire of a wider enthusiasm if they in turn are to co-operatf. in a missionary effortwhere so much is at stake. The selection of outside lecturers would call forthe greatest care and should be placed in the hands of a special board.65. We, therefore, think it very desirable that the present course intraining centres for officers should be readjusted to include some broaderinstruction on the above lines and that it should be extended by anotherfortnight in order to make its inclusion possible. Whatever argumentsare advanced in opposition to this view we are prepared on this point to stand on qualitative rather than on qualitative judgment. We hold that theServices will profit by the better training and experience of women passed through a course which has regard to the fuller development of their capacity as officers, even though the flow of the output may be somewhat slowed up.Members of your Committee have sometimes felt that excellent though arethe efforts of the various schools, the value and importance of intellectualstimulus, inevitably crowded out in the present timetables, is not alwaysappreciated.66. The practice of the W.A.A.F. has differed from the other two services in that the W.A.A.F. commission officers before sending them to training courses. A change in this procedure has, however, been under consideration for some time and we understand that as soon as accommodation is available it is proposed to open an officers cadet training course for the W.A.A.F.on lines similar to those in the other two Services. We hope that this change will be expedited as we consider the cadet system is preferable to commission-ing before training.Constant Movement of Officers.67. It is realised that the great expansion of the Services must create diffi-culties in units but there seems to be too much movement of officers in theA.T.S. and the W.A.A.F. Generally speaking we found when visitingstations that the majority of officers had rarely been in posts for more than three months. This is partly due to the shortage of officers but in any casesteps must be taken to diminish it if the efficiency and well-being of the unitsis to be increased and a degree of national economy effected. As we must continue to emphasise, the primary duty of the woman officer is the well-being of her women and this necessitates a knowledge of personnel and oflocal conditions which cannot be acquired without reasonable continuity ofservice on a station.Relations with Rank and File.68. There would seem to be a need for explaining to new recruits thereasons for rules and regulations, without which organisation cannot be carriedout. Her rights as well as her duties should be made clear to the recruit.The conditions and atmosphere of camp life are so different from those ofprivate life that they necessitate a great deal of adjustment on the part ofa newcomer to the Services. Loyal support of authority is often secured ifoffenders are told wiry the rule they have broken was first made. Rules shouldbe administered with discretion and the appearance of petty restriction avoided.We have heard, for instance, of girls with 48 hours&apos; leave being debarred fromcatching a midday, train on Saturday because of insistence on attendance atroutine duties which might well be waived in the circumstances.
Disciplinary Powers.69. This is one of the matters which should be brought into line for all three Services, but it is complicated b3&apos; being bound up with the difference inthe system of organisation and command between the two larger Servicesreferred to in Section IV. The Committee in the course of the enquiry havereceived complaints from officers both in the A.T.S. and the W.A.A.F. aboutthe inadequacy of their disciplinary powers. The principle of detention was pressed on us on all sides bodi by men and women officers who need furtherdisciplinary powers to deal with women who prove incorrigible in the Service.The Committee are satisfied from the evidence given to them that the com-plaints under this heading are fully justified and in fairness to the officers it isnecessary to deal with the difficulties so created. We understand, however,that the War Office are considering methods of punishment other than detention-tion, and since we conclude that any new steps taken to improve the disciplin-ary powers of the Army would apply equally to the A.T.S. we do not hi thesecircumstances press for detention powers. We must, however, stress the needin our opinion for action by the authorities in order to rectify the anomalies ofthe present situation. We further think that equal disciplinary powers andpunishment should obtain in the three Women&apos;s Services. We are forced to mention with great regret how frequently a high incidence of pilfering has beenbrought to our notice in the course of our visits and, though we are well awarethis failing is not peculiar to the auxiliaries, it pains us that the fine record ofthe women should be marred by this mean habit.70. We have had good accounts of the work of the A.T.S. and W.A.A.Fpolice. The number appointed for the A.T.S. is small in relation to the size of the Service and might well be increased.SECTION VI.-WELFARE WORK IN THE SERVICES.Responsibility of Officers.71. Welfare is a word of varying significance which covers a large and ill-defined field of social activity. As used by the Services in the sense of well-being it is concerned with a matter of outstanding importance in the relationsoi officers and men.72. The well-being of his men is the primary concern of an officer. It rests with him to be the guardian of their interests, to help them when in troubleor anxiety and to do all that in him lies to provide for their needs of mind andbody. Voluntary welfare activities as distinct from regimental well-being-carried on by civilians in co-operation with Services are of great value. such activities are largely concerned with the supply of additional &quot; comforts &quot;, andthe. organisation of hospitality in the neighbourhood for members of the rankswho are lonely&apos; or far from home. Books, games, recreation, concerts, are no less acceptable. But welfare in the sense of well-being is first and foremostthe duty of the officer and one that he can never delegate to another person.The principles are laid down very clearly in admirable publications of the WarOffice and Air Ministry known respectively as &quot; The Soldier&apos;s Welfare &quot; and&apos;: The Airman&apos;s Welfare &quot;. The Committee are satisfied that identical prin-ciples should hold good for the Women&apos;s Services and that in their relationswith the ranks under their Command, women officers should aim at a standardno less high and exacting than that laid down for men.73. Welfare in the sense of well-being should be a watch-word and not acatch-word of every good officer. In the Women&apos;s Services the officer, otherthan technical officer, has no operational duties.   Welfare, therefore, in the
203broader sense forms the major part of her work. The organisation of the three services differs in certain respects. As already explained in paragraph 48 the at.S. officers have administratibn, as well as welfare duties; W.A.A.F.administrative officers are appointed to be specialists in all matters affectinguie well-being of airwomen; while in the W.R.N.S. there are administrative officers, some of whom are quarters officers who live with the Wrens in quartersother than the smallest and are in charge not only of the catering and general management of the house, but also of the welfare of the Wrens off duty.74. The Women&apos;s Forces give useful guidance to their officers on specialmatters affecting women&apos;s interests. All three Services have issued compre-hensive statements on the action to be taken with pregnant women. TheW.A.A.F. have also issued a guide on matters affecting the children of per-sonnel which explains the policy of evacuation and gives particulars of the aidt&quot; available from the social services, both voluntary and statutory. The WarOffice and Air Ministry pamphlets on Soldiers&apos; and Airmen&apos;s Welfare have aoood deal of ground common to both men and women and we should liketo see them brought up to date and their application to the Women&apos;s Servicesstressed. Owing to expansion the cadre of women officers is in a constantstate of flux; so too is personnel. We fear that in consequence full use isnot being made of these valuable publications which would set before a young officer an inspiring standard of her duty.Voluntary Welfare Organisation Scheme.75. Turning now to welfare in its civilian and voluntary aspect, a welfareorganisation has been set up by the War Office based on the TerritorialAssociations and nominally covering the three Services. An honorarywelfare officer is appointed at Command and he is assisted by further voiun-tary workers in the counties and localities within the Command. The numberof these officers varies according to the size of the county and the numberof troops stationed in it. We understand that the total now amounts toabout 1,200 and that 400 women are being appointed. There is for each county a welfare committee to assist in the general organisation of the work.76. It was stressed to us authoritatively in evidence that a clear line of demarcation exists between the functions of a regimental officer and thoseof a welfare officer. The business of the voluntary welfare officer, as describedto us, is to act as liaison between the Services and the civilian population and to canalize the local spirit of good will in any area where H.M. forces are stationed. Local good will can express itself in many forms. In a friendlyneighbourhood help and amenities of various kinds will be forthcoming.Sometimes the welfare officer is able to get equipment for sports and gamesand to arrange for the loan of the local football field or cricket ground. we ourselves saw a welfare officer on one occasion arriving at a small A.A.station with a car loaded with gardening tools for the women. Sometimeshe organises local hospitality which takes different forms according to in-dividual needs to one person on an outpost a hot bath may be a boon beyondprice; another likes to pay an afternoon or evening visit and share in the family life. A third may be interested in local antiquities or history and is anxious for more information about them. The provision of a quiet room for reading or writing is specially welcome to men and women who want to escape at times from community life and be b3&apos; themselves and do nothing for a few hours in congenial surroundings away from men and women in uniform. Concerts, dances and entertainments are no less welcomed by thegregarious Local sewing parties who have organised themselves to darnsocks and mend clothes for the Forces earn deep gratitude for a very practicalform of service.
77- The voluntary welfare officer has two additional responsibilities ofconsiderable importance; first in assisting with the personal problems of theForces and second in the provision of comforts including not only woolliesbut books, furniture, equipment, etc. Domestic anxieties especially during a blitz period often occur among the ranks. Men are anxious about their families and do not know how to deal with difficulties, personal and legal,which may have arisen during their absence. Action by the welfare officer is naturally supplemental to and not a substitute for regimental action, but itis at this point of contact that the help of an older civilian, experienced in lawor local government, can be of value to a younger regimental officer. the civilian will know what local machinery exists through legal sources or throughthe Citizens&apos; Advice Bureau which can be set in motion to relieve the man&apos;sanxiety. Such co-operation can only be helpful to the Forces. With thesecond matter, namely the provision of comforts, we deal in detail in Sec-tion XIII.Voluntary Welfare Organisation Application.78. The welfare organisation as outlined above is excellent, but the Com-mittee have found it difficult to form a clear picture of how it works in thefield as a whole. Originating with the War Office it is only natural that thescheme should have attained its fullest development in the Army. welfare officers are instructed to draw no distinction between the personnel of theArmy, Navj&apos; and Air Forces so far as their activities are concerned. It isclear to us, however, from visits we have paid to the Services that the incidence of the work is very uneven. Many officers in the W.A.A.F. and theW.R.N.S. had never heard of the county welfare scheme, and like the AirForce and the Navy were obtaining comforts from other sources and operatingschemes of their own. We have come across frequent evidence in the Armyand in the A.T.S. of good work done by county? welfare officers, but on theother hand we have been in places where even the A.T.S. had no knowledgeof the facilities available and general ignorance on the subject has prevailed.Your Committee feel that the county welfare organisation requires a gooddeal of tightening up to make its application more general and consequentlymore fair. We think that within a Command or county, local welfare officers should meet from time to time to share experiences and pool ideas. such meetings would reveal existing gaps in the scheme and promote steps to fill them. We are also of opinion that work for the three Services wouldbe on a sounder footing if future local county welfare officers refrained from taking up honorary commissions in any one of the three Services,so that they may, as civilians, carry out their work impartially and withoutany apparent bias for all alike. Civilian dress with a distinguishing badgeor armlet would, in our opinion, serve to clarify their position as representa-tives of the civilian population for whom they act as liaison and avoididentification with any one Sendee. We should point out that probably themain reason for lack of knowledge in individual units about the local welfareorganisation is that for security reasons the initiative in making the necessarycontacts rests not with the welfare officer but with the officers of the Services.It follows that through ignorance or inadvertence the good will of a neigh-bourhood may remain untouched. We have the impression that in fact many local contacts exist outside the official organisation. But since the initiativerests with the unit we feel that stress should be laid on these possibilities of friendship and good cheer in instructions issued to officers on all stations.Specialist Officers in Women&apos;s Forces.79. Your Committee note that recently specialist welfare officers havebeen appointed to the W.A.A.F. and W.R.N.S. and that the A.T.S. are
209appointing three officers as advisers on sociological matters. We hope thatthese officers will form an integral part of the Service they join and that theywill be concerned with well-being in the Service sense rather than welfare inits comforts sense. We have already made it clear that we entirely share theviews laid down in the &quot; SoIdier&apos;s Welfare &quot; and &quot; Airman&apos;s Welfare &quot; thatwell-being is the primary duty of the officer, men and women alike. We trust,therefore, that the main task of the newly appointed specialists will be to stimulate and train younger officers in their work and advise them how to dealwith the difficult individual problems which are part of their responsibility.The importance of this work and its close relation to successful training andaencral morale should, in our opinion, not be minimised by the appointmentof specialists to deal directly with the rank and file.SECTION VII.-ACCOMMODATION AND FURNISHING.Types of Accommodation.80. There is wide variation in the conditions under which women in theForces are housed and the following types of accommodation are used:  Billets (Private Houses).Billets (Boarding Houses).Requisitioned houses.Married quarters on stations.Barrack blocks.Hutted camps.Service life does not admit of a uniform standard of comfort uniformly main-tamed. Conditions vary and are bound to vary fundamentally. Hardship at times is inevitable. Girls on remote and isolated sites necessarily lead a rough existence and are particularly dependent in these circumstances on thewatchful care and unselfishness of their officers.81. All Services agree in finding billeting the least satisfactory form of accommodation owing to difficulties of administration.   In a private houseit is not easy for officers to ensure that their women have suitable food .and that health conditions and other amenities are satisfactory.  On the otherhand, we have come across many instances of pleasant personal relations which have grown up between householders and girls, and when this happensbillets are popular and preferred to life in camp and barracks.   Broadly speak-ing billeting has been decreasing in the past few months but owing to thebuilding shortage it may be expected to increase.   Billeting is less unsatis-factory for the more senior Service women, but for young recruits undergoingor straight from basic training, it is generally very unsuitable.   Where billetshave to be used we think that frequent inspection of accommodation isnecessary to ensure maintenance of standards as to baths, wash basins andlavatories; the provision of a balanced diet, on which landladies might begiven special advice; and a reasonable degree of comfort.   We still feel farfrom satisfied that these conditions are always fulfilled.   Judging from the complaints which reach us the provision of lavatories in small houses bothquarters and billets often appears to be inadequate and this is a circum-stance which gives rise to much discontent.   Where billeting is used for large numbers of women and it is impracticable for a commissioned officer to visit regularly, we suggest delegation of the work to N.C.Os. who couldreport back on any deficiencies.   The knowledge that regular and frequentinspection of billets is made would tend to prevent deterioration in standards and would reassure personnel.82. We think that auxiliaries billeted by the A.T.S. and the W.A.A.F. inrequisitioned houses call for special attention and that this duty should atall times be impressed upon the officers. We have on various occasions found
conditions in such places unsatisfactory. The exterior of a requisitioned housemay look delightful but the interior may prove bleak and uncomfortable. \Vehave had complaints about difficulties with hoi water and baths which wehave proved for ourselves. We have also noted the discomfort which arisesowing to lack of pegs and shelves. Your Committee realise the wood shortagebut cannot believe that the resources of the country are inadequate to providepegs for hanging up coats in Service quarters. Such defects point rather to a lack of enterprise among the officers. A requisitioned house easilybecomes comfortless and squalid in appearance if the officer is lax in herstandards and is not prepared at all times to struggle for the welfare of hergirls.Limiting Factors in connection with Accommodation.83. While standards of accommodation must be such as to guarantee the health of the women and promote a good spirit among them, certain limitingfactors have to be taken into account: -(1) Considerations of national security sometimes make it necessaryto station groups of women in districts where it is particularly difficultto arrange for satisfactory accommodation. Similarly new camps are often opened in an unfinished state and the discomforts in such placesmay, for the time being, prove acute.(2) Standards laid down for women must not differ so greatly fromthose of the men that replacement of men by women is hampered andtheir readiness to bear equal hardships called in question. As an example,insistence at this stage of the war on covered ways and water-bornesewage would have this effect.(3) It may be necessary to forego certain conveniences desirable in themselves, to avoid deflecting labour and materials, which are in short supply, from other more essential uses.84. These considerations have affected the W.R.N.S. less than the A.T.S.and the W.A.A.F., with the result that the general level of accommodationused by the W.R.N.S. is noticeably higher than that provided in the other services.   This superiority is due to several causes:  (1) The establishment of the W.R.N.S. is smaller than that of theother Services, hence pressure on accommodation has not been so great.(2) One third of their number were recruited for immobile service and live in their own homes.(3) Large concentrations of W.R.N.S. are usually located near ports and dockyards, where the requisitioning of suitable accommodation didnot present undue difficulty.Degree of compliance with Standards of Accommodation.85. Requisitioned houses, when used as W.R.N.S. quarters, are normallyadapted for Service use and an adequate number of baths and lavatoriesinstalled. When huts are used, as is now becoming more common, dormitoryblocks are usually grouped around and close to the ablutions block, andconnected with it by a closed-in covered way. We have already pointedout that experienced Quarters Officers are responsible for the maintenance and care of requisitioned houses where Wrens are quartered. Hence the personnel normally live under very satisfactory conditions.86. Official standards are also good in the A.T.S. and the W.A.A.F,but it has been more difficult to adhere to them owing to the rapid expansionof both Services at a time of shortage of materials and labour. There canbe no question that great hardships were suffered when women were sent
2to camps before the accommodation was ready for them. The confusion and lack of elementary amenities were further aggravated by the very severe weather during the winter months.87. Your Committee must, of course, bow before the claims of security,DIU we find it hard to believe that security is achieved by sending women toa half-finished camp where they can neither eat, sleep nor work save inabnormal conditions. These latter react on health and morale and worksuffers proportionately. We urge that, when any new expansion takes place,mere should be no further repetition of these conditions and that livingquarters, in essentials, with equipment and stores, should be ready beforedrafts arrive. We have received many complaints of damp huts and wetwalls. Your Committee repeat that they are well aware the country is at war and that hardships and inconveniences are inevitable in the Services.But hardships which arise out of the state of war, and hardships due toinefficiency and lack of imagination in administration are different matters,and though the first would be cheerfully borne, there is no excuse for thesecond.88. All forms of accommodation are in use by the A.T.S. and the W.A.A.F.,but the commonest is the hutted camp. A good modern camp of this type,which provides for a large concentration of women has also proved the most successful from the point of view of administration, health and discipline.Further in a camp the community spirit is most readily fostered. Sanitaryarrangements in these camps are adequate. Here it is not the scale that matters there is no complaint of actual shortage but the fact that in huttedcamps the closets are generally constructed in blocks at varying distancesfrom the living quarters. Whatever the distance it has to be crossed in the open, and sometimes over partly made up ground, e.g. where camp roadsare not yet finished; so that visits to latrines may mean mackintoshes andgum boots. It is true that many old-fashioned country cottages are nobetter off. Shortage of labour and material has made it necessary to departfrom the A.T.S. requirement that sleeping huts should be linked to ablutionblocks and lavatories by a covered way, and the W.A.A.F. have neveradopted this standard. Your Committee do not feel able to press for thegeneral provision of covered ways, but they consider that where it is absenta night latrine of some sort should invariably be provided in an externalannexe connected to the sleeping hut. We are also of the opinion that more attention might be paid in the building of new camps to the siting of sleepinghuts in closer proximity to ablution blocks.89. For baths in camps it is common to have a proportion of them slipperpattern and a proportion showers. The latter have been of overhead type,which means that women have had to wear bathing caps or get their hairwet, but we have found that alterations are being made so that showers arefrom the shoulders downwards. In our experience we found that showerswere screened and private except for one camp in the W.A.A.F. where curtainshad not yet been procured. Showers for camps should, in our opinion,invariably be curtained. Ordinary washing facilities are sufficient but wethink that there should be a few screens in each ablution room so that privacycan be secured, if required, for the daily wash.90. A serious drawback in some camps, and particularly in dispersedW.A.A.F. camps, is the distance of messing accommodation from sleepingquarters. This inconvenience, like the necessity of going out-of-doors forbaths or to the lavatories, is one which can be accepted in a good spirit if other amenities are available. But undue hardship may occur if, for instance,sleeping quarters and common rooms are not warm and comfortable, andthere is inadequate provision for drying clothes in wet weather.
oi. Tn sleeping quarters the ordinary Service allowances for floor spaceare satisfactory and we have seen little evidence of over-crowding. As a precaution against infection (air-borne from the mouth) the women are told to sleep head to feet in adjacent beds six feet apart. Double bunksare more commonly used in the W.R.N.S. than in the other Services. Light-ing and natural ventilation are generally adequate, the latter being at timesmore than adequate. In winter time it must be a problem to warm some ofthe buildings we have seen, especially those heated by small stoves withpipes running up through the roof. Unless it is part of regular routineto keep the stoves cleaned and the flues swept, the stoves emit smokeinstead of heat. We consider that present standards though in placesrigorous are adequate, provided that the officers and N.C.Os. play their part in seeing that such standards are maintained and in trying to suggest the small improvements which often matter so much. There is normally ageneral rule in a camp that fires are not to be lit until a fixed hour-&quot;4.0 p.m. or 5.0 p.m. Commanding Officers can in fact exercise discretionon this matter, and an earlier hour is often advisable in damp or exposedcamps and in bad weather. It is customary for auxiliaries to clean theirown rooms and stoves and fo light their own fires. Some arrangement should be made to ensure that fires are lit in cold weather and kept goingfor workers before they come off duty.92. Most women prefer to launder their own personal clothing, and officialregulations provide facilities for washing, drying and ironing. The pro-vision is not by any means always adequate even when it exists and your committee urge that all possible speed and diligence should be used in bringing it up to standard.93. Where interiors are painted, your Committee consider it importantthaf light and cheerful colours should be used. This does not materially affectthe cost but it improves the light inside the huts or rooms, and helps tocreate and maintain a good atmosphere among the occupants. Drabsurroundings have a depressing effect on morale.Furnishing Equipment.94. Official standards of furnishing equipment are also good. In some respects those of the W.R.N.S. are slightly better than in the other Services.In the A.T.S. and W.A.A.F. rapid expansion and shortage of materialshave again led to difficulties of supply, particularly in regard to lockers andpegs. Variations in standards, however, are not always in favour of oldestablished stations: at one such station sleeping quarters were devoid ofany furniture save beds, and the women had absolutely nothing but then-kit bags in which to keep spare uniforms and personal effects, while theirliving accommodation generally was bare and comfortless. In the opinionof your Committee such a state of affairs should never be tolerated. Itappears that much depends on the officer&apos;s understanding of how and what to requisition, and her skill in knowing what powers are possessed by the unit to buy locally. There is also considerable scope for the exercise of persistenceand ingenuity in tapping other than the official sources. Appeals throughvoluntary organisations may, for the time being, provide useful gifts offurniture and equipment in short supply.95. We realise the difficulty in supplying locked receptacles owing to shortage of wood, but some provision is clearly needed for personal belong-ings, and it is suggested that the possibility of constructing lockers from other materials, including plastics, should be explored or failing this a handle andpadlock for kit bags issued.
SECTION VIII.-HEALTH AND HYGIENE.Entry into Service.06 The health of service women, for whom the State has assumed respon-responsibility during the war, receives careful attention from the authorities andelaborate arrangements are made to maintain their physical well-being and efficiency.07 Entry to the Service is through the doorway of medical examination.This work is carried out by Medical Boards set up by the Ministry of Labourand National Service. A Board normally consists of a Chairman and two other members, of whom one, wherever practicable, is a woman. In additionnot less than four women clerks are in attendance. The doctors work on a code of instructions approved by the Medical Advisory Committee and this Com-( mittee has recently suggested the addition of certain questions to help towardsthe elimination of the mentally unstable. Should any doubt arise reference canbe made to a consultant.08. As a result of the medical examination women are put into four grades.Those in Grade I and Grade II are accepted for the A.T.S. or the W.A.A.F.but we understand that the W.R.N.S. are prepared to take only Grade I. we see no reason for this differentiation in the case of women their work in thethree Services is comparable and we are of opinion that the W.R.N.S. should,in view of the women power position, take the same grades as the other two services. We have been informed that the amount of error in selection is just under 1 per 1,000 of the A.T.S. and W.A.A.F. which, considering the numberpassed through these Boards, is extremely slight. The women are thus highlypre-selected physically.oq. There are in addition two medical boards run by the War Office and AirMinistry for volunteers for the A.T.S. and the W.A.A.F. These seem to us tobe superfluous and we see no reason for their continuance.100. On arrival at their reception centres women are again inspected to seethat they have no infectious disease and to deal with the matter of head infesta-tion. It should be added that when women are called up for medical exaxnina-j tion by the Ministry of Labour Boards, reference is made to the Local Tuber-culosis Authority for appropriate information. A valuable experiment is beingmade by the A.T.S. and the W.A.A.F. in mass microphotography of the chest-but after entry into the Service to detect early signs of tuberculosis in thechest.101. Selective tests to assess intelligence are conducted for the A.T.S. by army personnel prior to the medical board examination. Women are gradedon the results of these tests and those in the lowest grade are not medically examined: the rejects on this ground amount to 5 per cent. For the W.A.A.F.at each reception centre a phychiatrist examines recruits who score less than15 on the G.V.K. test as well as those obtaining anomalous scores. If an indi-vidual is diagnosed as sub-normal, she is discharged forthwith under the ordin-ary procedure for getting rid of personnel who are unlikely to take advantageof their training and to become efficient in Service duties. For the W.R.N.S.there are personal references but no system of selective intelligence tests onentry. The Committee think that selective intelligence tests should be used inall the Women&apos;s Services and rejection of the lowest group made prior toI medkal examination.General Health.102. There are no comparable standards whereby to measure the general levelof health in the Services with that of civilians, but we have been assured by
the medical experts at the Service Departments and by doctors at the stationsthat the health or the women is extremely good. Provision of good food, goodclothes, facilities for outdoor exercise assciatcd with a regular life and frequentmedical examination, are raising the health standards of women and the mem-bers of your Committee have been impressed by the marked improvement inphysique, poise and self-confidence which is effected even by the first month&apos;straining. If uniform health records could be kept for the Services and forGovernment establishments, valuable information might be made available afterthe war for a study of health in relation to women&apos;s employment.103. The sickness rates of women in the Services, as in industry, are higherthan those of men, approximately twice as high, though the special ailments ofwomen, of course, account for part of this increase. But the greatest incidence of sickness occurs amongst those doing the less active duties, such as clerks;amongst the immobile rather than the mobile.   The more active the healthier.104. It has been impressed on us that the best menstrual as indeed general health prevails amongst girls and women doing strenuous and active work.We would instance an investigation made into the menstrual history ofsome 14,000 W.A.A.Fs. a cross-section of the various trades. The highestincidence of menstrual disorder was found in telephonists, teleprinters, radio-telephone operators, W.T. operators, clerks, tailoresses, dental and nursingorderlies, domestics, waitresses and batmen: then motor transport drivers,workshop hands, parachute packers and sparking plug testers; the incidencevarying from 13 -5 per cent, to 106 per cent, as an average for these groups.Those engaged in more active pursuits showed a much lower incidence, balloonoperators 8-8 per cent., fabric workers 8-4 per cent, and cooks 9 per cent.Approximately half those who suffer from menstrual disorders gave a historyof a similar condition before joining. The majority of those who developedirregularities after joining found they returned to normal within a fewweeks, particularly when their posting had become more or less stabilised,and they had become accustomed to Service life. Quite a number engagedin the more active trades found they experienced less menstrual trouble inthe Service than in civilian life.Medical Attendance and Hospital Treatment.105. The arrangements made for medical attendance, hospital treatment,and dental treatment have been planned and ordered with care in all three services. The amount of dental treatment needed was a revelation tous, but the serious inference to be drawn from it carries us beyond our terms of reference. In practice arrangements do not always work outaccording to plan. Individual delays, for instance, in medical attentionare inevitable in a system which involves the collecting together of thosereporting sick at a fixed time and in a fixed place known in the service as &quot; sick parade &quot;. It is laid down that medical officers should also visitbillets or quarters when it is reported that a woman is ill and cannot attendsick parade and it is the patienfs duty to report the fact to the N.C.O. ofher billet or hut.106. Reference was made in paragraph 31 to complaints about the treat-ment of minor ailments. It may happen that women falling sick in scatteredand distant billets owing to late reporting or transport difficulties may not receive prompt attention; and there may well have been instances, as hasbeen alleged to us, of a girl with a temperature walking some miles to hospital. Mistakes also must have occurred in diagnosis and treatment and in the disposal of patients in Services vastly expanded and staffedby doctors and nurses mostly inexperienced in Service ways. Moreovera number were also professionally inexperienced from whom a uniform
standard of care and skill was not to be expected. It is inevitable that somecases get missed, especially in billets; the question is how often? We haveno reason to believe that cases of inattentiveness or lack of skill are common,DUt we have received a number of complaints of this nature. We have already suggested that Commanding Officers should constantly review sicknessarrangements to ensure that the instructions are in fact implemented.107. In addition to sick parades, medical inspection parades of personnel in the Services are frequent. This has unfortunately become all themore necessary owing to the prevalence of infestation in the country.Inspections of the hands for scabies and of the heads for nits are made some-times weekly, usually fortnightly and never less than once a month, and onreturn from leave. It is satisfactory to note that the incidence of headinfestation in the Forces has been reduced to less than 2 per cent, as corn-pared with 25 per cent, among the civilian population of comparable ageToups. Th3 incidence among new recruits varies in different parts of thecountry&apos; and the Committee have noted with regret that it was up to a highfigure in certain reception centres.10S. In numbers and distribution both medical personnel and bed accom-modation appear adequate. The hospitals are well staffed by specialistsincluding women dieticians, and there are various well-equipped specialisthospitals and centres, e.g. for orthopaedics and nervous disease. In addition there is co-operation with the Emergency Medical Service hospitals and theirconsultants.109. In hospitals we find existing facilities for gynaecological treatment including a number of diagnostic centres that have been set up to be adequate. We consider, however, that more women gynaecologists shouldbe appointed. There are a few in the Services, but the majority of thewomen are medically cared for by men. It is possible that if more womengynaecologists were employed not so much as specialists in hospitals as onstations, women would seek their advice more readily than they would thatof a man.no. Both the Director General of Army Medical Services and the MedicalDirector General of the Navy have women on their Directorates and we under-stand such an appointment is to be made on the staff of the Director General ofthe Air Force Medical Services.in. In the A.T.S. and W.A.A.F. considerable use is made of womenmedical officers who are employed on the larger stations, but an increase inestablishment appears necessary especially in the large reception and trainingcentres. We think that use should be made of women medical officers in the reception stations for W.R.N.S. and that a woman medical adviser should beappointed to each Naval Command.112. For the three Services, Nursing Sisters, who are State RegisteredNurses, and also V.A.Ds. are employed in hospitals and large sick quarters.Recently the R.A.F. have instituted a combined post of nursing and healthwelfare sister at certain smaller sick quarters to act as health confidante to women, which seems to us an excellent idea.113. The R.A.F. Medical Branch in addition employ women who are specifically -cally trained as nursing orderlies to work under the direct supervision of themedical officer. They are being substituted to the extent of 50 per cent, of theRAF. nursing orderlies in hospitals and sick quarters. We were told that thisinnovation was at first resisted but is now welcomed. We suggest it would be advisable to afford such of these women as show ability and a desire to take upnursing as a career, an opportunity to transfer to the nursing profession, by allowing them to become student nurses in recognised training schools with aview to sitting, for the examinations of a State Registered Nurse.
H4- There are no women nursing orderlies as distinct from medical orderliesin the W.R.N.S. or in the A.T.S. The V.A.Ds. who are not trained nurseshave been used to act as medical orderlies in these two Services. The WarOffice are inviting the Red Cross and the Order of St. John to appoint repre-sentatives to a Committee to be set up under an independent chairman to con-sider relationship of mobile V.A.Ds. to the Army.Personal Hygiene.11.5. The instruction and lectures given in the care of the body, cleanliness,hair, teeth, feet, diet, etc., are clear and sensible. A special lecture on personalhygiene is given to recruits in all three Services, and the W.A.A.F. also deal inthis lecture with pregnancy and venereal disease.116. We have heard the W.A.A.F. lecture which was given by a womandoctor and which we understand has received the approval of senior clergy ofall denominations. We are of opinion that it was delivered with constraint anddelicacy in a simple non-technical manner which was not open to criticism.117. Judging, however, by the complaints which have reached us, exaggerated-gerated rumours appear to have gathered about hygiene lectures in the Forces.In so far as these lectures deal among other subjects with pregnancy andvenereal disease, such questions obviously need handling with tact and wisdom.Though the W.A.A.F. lecture we heard was unexceptional in this respect, weare bound to add that we were not satisfied with the conditions under which itwas given. An address of this kind should not in our opinion be given in alarge hall, to an audience of recruits of all ages varying in number from 500 to2,000. In such circumstances it is comparatively easy for individual membersof such an audience, who are young and inexperienced, not to hear the lectureproperly even with microphones, and to misconstrue what is being said. the mental reactions of a girl unaccustomed to attributing precise meanings to wordsand bewildered by the impact of new and unfamiliar terms must be kept inmind.118. A further question, however, arises. In our opinion there should be inall three Services a lecture to auxiliaries on the wider implications of sexbehaviour explaining the value both to the community and to the individual ofstable family relationships based on the permanent physical, emotional andintellectural partnership of man and woman; not because the sex morals of theForces are more precarious than those of civilians but because as we argue else-where, life in the Forces presents new educational opportunities.119. We are well aware of the difficulties which beset any attempt to secure a general acceptance for the treatment of this prickly and over-emotionalisedsubject, and we are conscious of the danger of accepting help from outsideorganisations with particular angles of approach. Varied and debatable thoughthe approach to this subject may be, there is common agreement on one point-namely, that ephemeral sex relationships create more emotional problems thanthey appear to solve. It should not be beyond the combined wit of themedical and educational services concerned, to provide a standard lectureon broad lines which would be generally acceptable.120. A set lecture to recruits does not, however, carry us very far along the road of sex education. Here as in so many other aspects of welfare,the officers must ultimately play the vital part in their dealings with individualwomen. We think that carefully planned lectures and discussions on personalrelationships, the psychology of sex and the sociological implications of the family should be introduced into officers&apos; training and refresher courses. Insuch selected groups there should be some scope for the introduction of outsidespeakers, since in relatively small audiences with freedom of discussion and
213chaired by a Commanding Officer a reasonable balance of opinion could besecured. Misapprehension would thus be avoided which may easily arise inaddresses given to a large and mixed audience of widely different educationalexperience.Hairdressing.121. Hairdressing services at comparatively low charges are now estab-lished in all the training centres and large stations where A.T.S. and W.A.A.F.are located but there is no official provision for the W.R.N.S. for whomN.A.A.F.I. may provide hairdressing facilities where there is a large estab-lishment. Little excuse, therefore, now exists for a girl to allow her headto get dirty a second time. Where a case still occurs, in the opinion of your committee, a girl should be made to realise that apart from the reflectionon her personal dignity she is exposing her comrades to risk. Hair neatlyt dressed and a tidy head are essential to self-respect and a smart appearanceamong all ranks. Hairdressing may present special difficulties in remotesites but it should be within the ingenuity of the women to help one another in this respect.Nervous Diseases.122. Personnel suffering from neurological complaints are treated in theService Hospitals, and consultants in neurology are available in difficult cases.Psychiatric cases falling into the psychoneurosis group are transferred to specialhospitals, staffed by experts in this type of disorder, while adequate arrange-ments have been made for the reception into hospital of cases of psychosis.Members who are suspected by their medical officer of being unstable are referred to one of the service psychiatrists who are able to recommend dis-charge in cases where adaptation to service life is proving too difficult.123. We have been supplied with figures showing the incidence of psychosis,in the A.T.S. and the W.A.A.F. which amounts to .64 per thousand. Weunderstand the figure for the civilian population is .85 per thousand. Thefigure for the Service relates to personnel recruited mainly during the period when facilities for selective intelligence tests were not available. With thetightening up of procedure prior to enlistment the number of cases wouldbe reduced. While we realise that it is difficult to compare the figures forthe Services and the civilian population, it is, we think, safe to draw fromthe figures available the conclusion that service in the Forces makes for ratherthan against mental stability.124. It has been suggested that more convalescent and hospital accommo-dation is needed for neurotics and psychotics but even if such a policy weredesirable, which we doubt, the figures we have seen do not support the sug-gestion. The remedy appears to be in better initial selection plus dischargeas soon as it appears that a woman is unlikely to become an efficient member.Pregnancy.125. Rumours that illegitimate pregnancy was both common and on theincrease in the Services, have been rife. This is the kind of rumour that startsin every war. The facts are otherwise. Illegitimate pregnancy is almost certainly less common in the Services than out of them, and statistics aregiven in paragraph 203.126. It can be said with assurance that no woman runs an extra risk of becoming pregnant by joining a Service: and that if she does become pregnantthe arrangements made for her care and disposal are both humane and efficient. In order to make suitable provision for pregnant Service women, adischarge depot for cases requiring emergency accommodation has been
opened. In this connection it must be borne in mind that there are sub-stantial numbers of married women in the Forces, who are awaiting dischargebut are unable to go immediately to their homes or hostels. This depot onlyaccommodates auxiliaries for a limited period and in no case after 30 weeksqf pregnancy. While at the depot the auxiliary is put in touch with one ofvarious societies the most important of which are the Church of EnglandMoral Welfare Council, the Social Service Board for Scotland and theSoldiers&apos;, Sailors&apos; and Airmen&apos;s Help Society who make the necessary arrangements for confinement and for the future. There are, of course inaddition maternity homes and hospitals administered by the local authorities for admission to which these women are eligible, if they return to their ownhomes. Up to the present the facilities have proved adequate but the situa-tion is now becoming more difficult. The number of cases needing help j:increasing as the Services expand and we must point out that not onlysingle women need help; there are numbers of married women who haveno homes and no relations to go to and some of them have husbands over-seas. Pressure on accommodation by civilian population is also increasingThe birth rate has risen and institutional treatment is becoming the acceptedpractice for confinements, especially now that it is difficult to obtain skilledcare at home. Further some maternity homes have been blitzed. This isa national and not a service problem. We desire to press its urgency onthe Ministry of Health and to suggest that they should take immediate action by way of making grants to local authorities and existing voluntaryassociations for further accommodation during pregnancy, by making moreprovision in hospitals, in maternity and in convalescent homes for the con-fmement and after-care of mothers, and in residential nurseries for the children of women desirous of returning subsequently to the Services.Venereal Diseases.127. We have been given figures of venereal disease to show the incidencein women as compared with men, the men&apos;s being approximately double thatof the women. There are no reliable civilian figures available with which to compare the service statistics. Members of the Committee on their visitshave enquired as to the number of cases and have been impressed by thelow incidence reported in the Women&apos;s Services. Arrangements for diagnosisand treatment are adequate but more women medical officers might beemployed in the gynaecological wards of the hospitals.SECTION IX___CLOTHING.128. During the early days of recruitment it is alleged that some delavoccurred in the issue of certain articles of kit, such as greatcoats. Theschedule of service clothing is excellent, and all articles on the schedule arenow in issue. Women used to high heels find that the service shoe though of good quality is nt first not easy to wear and causes much trouble withthe feet. We think that it should be permissible during basic training forwomen to bring old and comfortable shoes for alternate wear until the fee;are hardened.129. One of the complaints we have received is that the service jacketis of such thick and durable material that in hot weather walking out in itis a burden. We were glad to see that sanction has been given to the A.T.S.to discard the tunic during hot weather and we think this should be adoptedin the other two Services.130. We recommend a free issue of physical training kit to all Servicewomen in the W.A.A.F. and the W.R.N.S. as is already being done in the
a x.S. or failing this an issue for each station. It is undesirable that women should do physical training in their undergarments as we have found.131. We have had representations that allowances for civilian clothing ondischarge are inadequate. The allowances are 30s. in the A.T.S. andthe W.A.A.F. with an additional 35s. in the A.T.S.. for an overcoat forwomen discharged between October and March and a grant of an overcoatin the VV.A.A.F. to women discharged in the same period on medical groundsother than pregnancy. The women are also allowed to keep underclothing,shirts, stockings and shoes. The W.R.N.S. can keep all clothing exceptbuttons and badges the uniform merely becomes a navy blue suit notidentifiable as a Service uniform. Associations such as the Soldiers&apos;,Sailors&apos; and Airmen&apos;s Help Society are subsidising the amounts allowedan the A.T.S. and the W.A.A.F. very heavily. Many women on joining upsell their clothing to meet commitments, or give them to relations; wherethe recruit has a sister for instance, the latter has often worn out thegarments in the belief that they will not be required again; and even ifthe clothing is still in the recruit&apos;s possession, she has often grown outof if. Further women discharged for pregnancy want outsize garmentswhich are always more expensive. The service allowances are clearly in-adequate to purchase outer garments and we suggest that they shouldbe increased.SECTION X.-CONDITIONS OF WORK.132. Service hours are not easily comparable with industrial hours. Inthe fighting Services it cannot generally be argued at any rate from thesame premises as in industry what the optimum hours of work shouldbe. The usual service hours are regular and not excessive. There isno question of industrial fatigue on the contrary fatigue often ewes itsorigin more to boredom and monotony. But there are exceptions. Thereare in the Services tradeswomen such as telephonists, teleprinter operators,radio-operators, plotters, etc., whose conditions of work are similar tothose prevailing in factories and offices. Their hours of work, rest andmeals should not be irregular. Yet such instances occur. This appears tobe due to a policy prevalent in the Services of working &quot; watches &quot; or&quot; shifts &quot; with irregular hours of duty in order to get longer free periods.133. It should have been known by now that irregular rhythm of working hours is injurious to health. We suspect that were figures available (whichwould need a special enquiry) the groups of Service women working irregular&quot; watches &quot; would show an excess of gastric and nervous illness, for thetwo types of illness are associated with fatigue and strain. Further iffigures of output, mistakes, spoiled work and accidents were also available,efficiency would be found to have suffered.134. For this continuous shift work we think that from the health pointof view it would be preferable for personnel to do the same watch perioddaily for a fortnight before changing over to another period. A fortnightis suggested as being a better period than a week to allow of adaptation tophysiological rhythm of waking and sleeping, whilst a month is regarded by many as too long. We further recommend that workers should not,except in an emergency, work for more than 8 hours a clay or more than48 hours a week.135. Some increase of personnel might be needed to carry out these suggestions, and we realise that the reactions. of many individuals wouldbe adverse. The change would be unpopular for it would interfere with theengagements and enjoyments of the women, many of whom are young girls,
in their off-duty times. Many prefer broken sleep and irregular mealsrather than to be tied to night duty for a fortnight. Unless, howeverthere are valid reasons to the contrary we think that the suggestions shouldbe explored and we suspect that the expense of extra staff would be repaidby extra efficiency.136. But where there are groups of workers employed at posts which require to be manned at all hours of the clay and night in air-conditionedrooms and in artificial light, it is not practicable to suggest a fortnightlyperiod of night work. We think that where these conditions obtain, in.investigation should be made to determine optimum hours and the best shift system applicable in the circumstances. We would further suggest thatwhen on day duty the women should be given longer breaks in the fresh air.137. Into a working spell of eight hours, rest pauses or breaks, longsince recognised in industry, need to be introduced. We have seen wonieifhi the Services during their 10 or 15 minutes&apos; break from an exacting dutyin an atmosphere physical and mental which impressed us as the reverseof the benefit a rest pause is meant to confer.13S. The hours which we have just considered are hours of routine work,but there are other instances in the Services of occasional long hours, entail&apos;ing strenuous work (sometimes during the black-out) and difficulty withmeals. Wc have received complaints of women drivers sent out on lorn-distances taking with them insufficient food for the journey and with in-sufficient money in their pockets to buy a meal; and on arrival after anexhausting trip being poorly fed. Some camps issue excellent made upjourney meals and in one camp we saw such packets being issued from a food factory. Subsistence allowances are payable for all journeys involvingabsence from the depot of more than five hours, the amounts varying accord-ing to the length of such absence; and we are glad to hear that negotiations are proceeding to effect an improvement in these allowances. Diffictikieshave occurred in the past over expenses incurred for hotel accommodationby women driving officials, when provision could not be made for them in service quarters or billets. We understand, however, that where it is no!practicable to arrange for a woman who is driving an officer or official to be accomodated in such quarters or billets, and it is necessary to incur expensefor hotel accommodation in excess of the normal night allowance becausecheaper lodgings are unobtainable, a special allowance for bed and breakfastmay now be claimed.SECTION XI.-POSTING-EMPLOYMENT AND LOCATION.139. Your Committee realised early during the enquiry that the fullutilisation of individual capacity is an essential for the maintenance ofmorale in the Services. Nothing breeds a sense of frustration more rapidly than the knowledge that skill and experience are being wasted. Women willundergo temporary hardship willingly and cheerfully if they know that bytheir service they are making a real contribution to the national effort. Onthe other hand, it is inevitable that for service reasons certain personnelhave periods of inactivity or under-employment which rapidly produce bore-dom and discontent unless properly handled.140. Your Committee think that a better understanding on the part of therecruit (and still more perhaps on the part of her family) of some of the inherent difficulties in the transition from civilian to Service life should be aimed at in the introductory stages. Time for detailed explanations shouldbe given when a recruit is first interviewed and no hopes raised which cannotsubsequently be fulfilled.
141. Each auxiliary Service has its own recruiting machinery and makes bymeans of propaganda and leaflets its individual appeal to women to join the ranks. Some of these, in the opinion of your Committee, have paintedservice conditions in over-bright colours. We believe in an appeal to dutyrather than to glamour.W.R.N.S. and Employment.142. The W.R.N.S. are a comparatively small auxiliary force and theirstaffing and establishment problems are easier to control than those of theother two Services. Further, the approach to candidates has been realistic.The leaflet issued sets out the functions of the Service and the importance of-ts work, and explains the position regarding immobile and mobile units.Then follows a list of categories of service and their necessary qualifications,adding the proviso that some categories are small at a given moment and only a limited number of personnel are required for them. It points out,however, that posts of various kinds are continually occurring. Details of past and present jobs must be given on the application form so as to enablethe W.R.N.S. authorities to judge whether suitable employment can orcannot be offered to the candidate.Special Problems of A.T.S. and W.A.A.F. in connection withEmployment.143- The claims of the A.T.S. and the W.A.A.F. are set out in attractiveform in their respective literature. Both Services have had special difficulties to contend with during the past year, not merely owing to the rapid expan-sion of their numbers but to the variety of trades in which women arereplacing men. Further, the number of these trades is still increasing. Itis not surprising, therefore, if during a period of such rapid expansion therehave been misfits and waste of personnel.144. Women for the Services were recruited originally on a voluntary basis and are still being so recruited to the extent of almost 50 per cent,in the A.T.S. and almost entirely in the W.A.A.F. To attract the necessarynumber of recruits, volunteers have been given a choice in the selection ofoccupation, subject to fitness and suitability after training.145. Two matters have proved embarrassing to the authorities, choice ofoccupation and compassionate posting. Though large numbers of volunteershave been placed in, or trained for, the occupations they have selected, ithas not always been possible to meet individual wishes either because the candidate proves unsuitable or because there are no vacancies. This is a situation which creates discontent and unsettlement. The principle of choice of occupation has necessarily limited the Service authorities in their assign-ment of girls to jobs where their civilian skill and experience could be used.The appeal for motor drivers for instance attracted numbers of girls whoseexperience might have been put to good use in the Services as shorthand-writers, telephonists or clerks.146. Rapid expansion has compelled the maintenance of a pool of trainedwomen who are available for the opening up of new camps and stations.Temporary under-employment has thereby occurred or mis-employmentowing to trained women having been set to work at relatively unskilled jobspending final posting.147. During the rapid growth of the Air Force there have been inevitablechanges in plan which in turn have created surpluses in certain trade categories of the W.A.A.F. and led to their closure for the time being. Some evidencesuggests an undue time lag between the point at which surpluses arose and
either remustering the recruit for other occupations or releasing her f0rcivilian employment. Such women, therefore, when surplus to requirement,have been under-employed or mis-employed. Further, workshop handsemployed on a skilled occupation have been unable to rcmuster to a highertrade group owing to the closure of that trade.148. Your Committee think that publicity has given rise to misunderstandingon the subject of choice of employment and that in any event this choice shouldnot be encouraged. The Women&apos;s Services only exist in virtue of the nationalneed, and if girls were told that they have a national duty to fulfil rather thanthe fulfilment of their own wishes, subsequent discontent might be disminished.149. We recommend, therefore, that:  (1) A volunteer should be recruited to the Women&apos;s Service which sheprefers but not invited to select an occupation- one possibly remote from her previous experience. She should then be posted to a unit or trainedfor a job for which her civilian experience fits her. Exception should bemade if it is shown by aptitude tests and by personal interview that she hasbeen misplaced in her civilian work or if her civilian work is useless to theService.(2) If a woman, after training, is held in a pool or holding companypending posting or is posted to another occupation, an adequate explana-tion should be given as to why the failure has arisen together with an assur-ance that she will be allocated to a trade vacancy at the earliest possible date.(3) When women, awaiting posting, are kept in a pool or holding com-pany, more should be done to make the waiting period profitable andinteresting.Posting near Home.150. On the question of posting near home, the three Services take differentlines. The W.R.N.S. recruit for mobile and immobile units mobile if women are willing to serve anywhere in the United Kingdom; immobile if they live neara naval establishment where W.R.N.S. personnel are required and can carryout duties for which they are appointed while living at home. All officers in theW.R.N.S. are, however, mobile. This practice of recruiting for immobile unitshad much to commend it when the supply of women was in excess of demand,but to-day woman-power is an acute problem and the question arises whetherthe W.R.N.S. are absorbing in their immobile units women whose circumstancesdo not debar them from mobility, and who could be replaced by immobile and perhaps part-time labour. It has always been the policy of the W.R.N.S. to post mobile members at their request to the neighbourhood of their homes if therequirements of the Service permitted.151. The A.T.S. and the W.A.A.F. have no immobile units. In the A.T.S.publicity has been on the lines that so far as practicable girls will be posted neartheir homes, and that girls already in the Service may apply for transfer nearerhome when everything possible will be done to see that the request is granted.The A.T.S. have also recently instituted for the Army Pay Corps and RecordOffices a system of direct enrolment, whereby girls are recruited for work in aparticular establishment on the understanding that they will be allowed to liveat home unless the establishment is moved.152. For the W.A.A.F., recruiting officers are instructed to inform all recruitsvolunteering for that Service that after completion of their training they will be posted according to the requirements of the Sendee; but that so far as is practicable consideration will be given to a request for posting to a station near the recruifs home, it being understood that no such posting can be regardedas permanent.   Thus, an airwoman who expresses a wish for a particular
216locality may be sent there if, but only if, posting of airwomen of the trade con-cerned are being made to that locality. Applications for airwomen receivedalter initial posting on completion of training are considered if recommended oncompassionate grounds, but the Air Ministry take the line that the interests ofthe Service require such transfers to be kept to a minimum since efficiency is governed by continuity of service and the avoidance of unnecessary movement.Cases of definite hardship are, however, given special consideration.153- Your Committee think that provided the position is made clear torecruits (and there is some evidence that this is not always done) the line takenby the W.A.A.F. is a sound one. The efforts made about compassionateplacing prove the genuine desire of the authorities to soften the operation of theNational Service Act to both parents and girls. We feel bound, however, topoint out the complications which consequently arise in the administration ofthe Women&apos;s Services.154. Recruits at a Training Centre are allotted to various trade categoriesand at the conclusion of training are posted to units where vacancies in cate-gories occur. As an illustration a girl&apos;s home may be near Reading and sheasks for posting to that locality on leaving the Training Centre. But hertrade category in that of a clerk and the A.T.S. unit in the Reading area has no vacancy for clerks but wants cooks. Consequently, she is posted, say,to Nottingham where clerks are in demand. The alternative that she shouldbe placed in a pool and kept there till a vacancy at Reading occurs surelycould not be contemplated by any reasonable person. The country is engagedin a struggle for existence and the first business of each one of us is to fit our lives into the war effort, rather than the war elfort into our lives.We also think it very undesirable that Service life should be regarded as aninterlude. If a girl is stationed near home, then home rather than the Servicetends to be her chief concern. We have reason to doubt whether all applica-tions for compassionate posting are made to meet the girls&apos; personal wishes.We have heard frequently of girls who, after an initial period of homesickness,settle down quite happily with new friends in new places. Some indeed sayfrankly that Service life is a chance to get away from home and see something of the world. The possessiveness of some parents may often be the motiveforce in application for compassionate posting and the well-being of the girla matter of secondary importance.155. Your Committee recommend, therefore, that in view of the greatadministrative difficulties involved in a general policy of placing near home,such placing should not form part of any definite instruction to the Services.But, in so far as women can be posted in their home areas without dislocationto the normal arrangements or any holding up of trained recruits, we thinkendeavours should be made to reduce geographical distances as much aspossible in order to simplify arrangements for leave and avoid long railwayjourneys. When the individual need for genuine compassionate posting arisesdue to exceptional family circumstances, such need should receive quick,careful and sympathetic consideration and efforts be made to meet it.W.A.A.F. Reception and Training Centres.156. Your Committee wish to draw attention to a further point. It has beenthe practice of the W.A.A.F. to send new recruits for a week or less to oneof two centres for reception arrangements, including medical inspection, equip-ment and selective trade tests. Subsequently, they have been sent to anothercentre, some hours distant by train, for a month&apos;s basic training. The recep-tion centres are hutted camps but in the basic training centre girls have tobe housed in billets, and their lectures, drills, recreation activities and sickquarters are scattered over the town.    Arrangements are, we understand,
SECTION XII.-TRANSIT AND LEAVE ARRANGEMENTS.Transit.158. The large Service intake last winter inevitably led to a good deal ofimprovisation and arrangements for travelling and leave were far from satis-factory. They were further complicated by severe weather and delays owingto snowstorms. More care is now taken to ensure that women do not starton a journey at an hour likely to leave them, at nightfall, strandedhalf-way to their destination. To-day this problem is one or small dimensions,but it may increase during the coming winter should difficulties arise with therailway services or a blitz period recur.159. The problem is to find suitable accommodation near railway stations for women and girls on transit. Much has been done and more is being done by the voluntary associations to open up rest centres at large railwaystations throughout the country where Service women, who for various reasons are stranded and have to wait about for early morning trains, may spend the night. At stations where there is no rest centre a few bunks in the ladies&apos;waiting room might be provided. The situation at all costs to be avoidedis that a girl, finding herself at a late hour in a strange place, should be forced, during the blackout, to try and get a bed for the night. One plan is to arrange for the R.T.O. or Stationmaster to have an address furnished by a responsible local organisation of one or more women residents, livingpreferably near the station, who would be prepared, in an emergency, to put up one or two girls for the night. The W.V.S. have started this practice ina few provincial towns and we think it should be extended to other places.In large stations it might be advisable to have women on the R.T.Os.&apos; staff.Leave.160. There is also a very real problem of catering for a woman on herseven days&apos; or 48 hours&apos; leave, if she is unable, or does not wish, to go home.Committees, set up by the Services, have prepared lists of towns wheretransit or leave accommodation is required. Voluntary associations-particu-larly the Church of Scotland, the Y.W.C.A., the Church Army, the SalvationHinow being made for a proportion of the new recruits to go to one centre only for reception and basic training, but ir. appears that a proportion of them will still go to one of the two reception centres for a week or so and then toanother centre for basic training.157. We are of opinion that all recruits should be sent for reception andbasic training to one centre, preferably a centre where the need for billetingdoes not arise. The use of two centres, one for reception and one for trainingin widely distant towns, aggravates the problem of individual adjustment to new conditions. A second long journey, followed possibly by a walk of a mile or more in cold or wet weather to her billet, is a discouraging experiencefor a homesick girl wearing an unfamiliar uniform and new service shoes.Further, a centre where new recruits are housed in private billets withoutcentralised training facilities presents great administrative problems, and while,the W.A.A.F. are to be congratulated on the manner in which these problemsare being dealt with, we think that a system of two centres with very different conditions in widely separated towns, one for reception and one for basictraining complicates the problem of settling down in the Service. Further,billeting of recruits in private houses during the period of training musthamper the officer in her assessment of a girl&apos;s personality. We trust, there-fore, that, as soon as practicable, it may be replaced by a system which provides for combined reception and basic training centres for all recruits,and where recourse need not be had to billeting.
Army, Toe H are providing huts and hostels in many large towns whereService women, stranded for the night or on leave, can get accommodation at cheap rates. There are in London over 50 clubs and hostels availableto personnel on leave. Hostels with club facilities in provincial towns nearcamps are catering for local need and the voluntary associations are beingassisted by Service authorities in requisitioning suitable buildings.161. Another method of dealing with the woman on leave is by hospitalityfrom private individuals. Many associations and the local welfare officers have interested themselves in receiving offers of such private hospitality the Incorporated Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Help Society have on record 1,200addresses where hospitality is available for women on leave for periods vary-in&quot; from 24 hours to 14 days. The W.V.S. have also made similar arrange-&quot;tnents in a large number of areas. It is unfortunate that the privatehospitality scheme has, so far, proved only a modified success. In some respects it is to be preferred to hostels, and girls who have availed themselves of it return to visit the same friends again and again. The success of thescheme appears to depend on making personal contacts between the Servicewomen and their hostesses and in careful selection of the offers of hospitalityso that girls can go to congenial homes. Some mutual interest betweenhostesses and guests is thus secured. Reference is made in paragraph 169to the value of local hospitality for girls working on isolated sites. Butwomen are diffident about accepting hospitality from strangers, and suchhospitality, unless offered in the right spirit, may prove an unsatisfactoryexperience on both sides. We are glad to learn that the leave of 48 hoursmay now be added to the seven days&apos; leaver a concession of great value togirls who are posted far from their homes.162. There is a further problem which has caused us some concern, namely the provision of food for Service women when in transit or on return fromleave. Girls, going on transit or on leave, are given a haversack rationwhich, as we have seen for ourselves on several stations, is quite adequate.But difficulties may arise over hot drinks and over food itself on the outwardjourney if there is any long delay due to accident or bad weather. similar conditions may arise on the return journey. Railway refreshment rooms and service canteens, where they exist, are increasingly crowded now that therestaurant service on trains is largely suspended, and women are finding greatdifficulty about obtaining food on a journey. We are of opinion that arrange-ments should be made at main railway stations to provide more trollies fromwhich Service men and women could obtain tea and refreshments.SECTION XIII.-COMFORTS AND RECREATION.163. Comforts like welfare with which they are closely connected-cover a wide field of activity. They supplement Government issues and softenin minor matters the austerity of provision made by the State. Theirfunds are derived from many sources; big and small, official and unofficial.Large Service units can always look after themselves but we are not so clearabout the position in small and isolated stations. The exigencies of Servicelife in this as in many other respects do not permit of the distribution ofcomforts on lines of mathematical equality. The business of modern warincludes a great variety of operations, some carried on by personnel living in comfortable conditions remote from the hazards of battle, others which involve considerable hardship. It is in golfers&apos; language the rub of the greenand this inequality runs through every phase of the Service man or woman&apos;slife. But clearly when conditions are tough, the units in question have con-siderable claims on such additional amenities as service funds or a sympatheticpublic can provide; a point the Committee desire to stress.
Official Provision.164. To begin with the larger units. Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes,popularly known as N.A.A.F.I., exist in all camps and barracks of a substantialsize. These usually provide writing, rending and recreation rooms as well as acanteen. Such amenities may be provided separately for women or they maytoe shared jointly by men and women when both are working on the station,though sometimes a room is reserved for the exclusive use of each sex.N.A.A.F.I. is a semi-commerciai body which works for the Government and all its profits in one way or another return to the Services, a certain percentagebeing paid direct to unit funds for the comfort of the troops. From this fundamenities such as easy chairs, sports equipment, recreational facilities, news-papers and magazines are provided. Wherever there is a large N.A.A.F.I.adequate profits are available and the camp can always rely on a steady and sufficient income from this source.165. Supplementary to the N.A.A.F.I. is the welfare organisation which inits turn can give grants of money for furnishings, mobile canteens, hostels,musical instruments and voluntary entertainment. Each force has also its ownfunds the A.T.S. Comforts Fund (Duchess of Northumberland), the R.A.F.Comforts Fund and the R.N. Amenities Fund from which additional comfortsmay be obtained. Further amenities such as sports equipment, indoor games,radios and gramophones when obtainable are provided by a generous donor, Lord Nuffield. The above list does not exhaust all existing benefactions for there are, in addition, regimental and newspaper funds as well as funds raisedby local initiative for special purposes. From this multiplicity of sources itshould be possible to provide a minimum of comforts for all units of the Ser-vices, big and small, but distribution is very obscure and the Committee cannotfeel that it is in every respect satisfactory.Activities of Constituents of Council of Voluntary War Work.166. The official organisation of amenities is further supplemented by theefforts of voluntary societies. The Y.W.C.A., the Salvation Army and theChurch Army, are old and trusted friends of the Services. Many soldiers,sailors and airmen still bear in grateful remembrance their unselfish and devotedwork at home and abroad during the first world war. They have shown no less concern for the welfare of Service men and women in the present struggle.In order to avoid overlapping, the above organisations together with Toe H,the Church of Scotland and other religious organisations, are constituent mem-bers of the Council of Voluntary War Work which allocates canteen andinstitute work between them. W.V.S. has recently become an associate though not a constituent member of the Council, and does excellent work in areas where the older organisations do not function. The Y.W.C.A., Church Armyand Salvation Army huts are familiar features in many camps. They provideordinary club facilities with quiet rooms and comfortable chairs as well as a drycanteen. The homely atmosphere of the hut appeals to many girls of the lessexuberant type who are glnd to have an opportunity to rest and read quietlyduring their leisure time.   Entertainments, concerts, talks, are also arranged.Position on Remote Sites.167. Your Committee would like to see the work of the voluntary societiesgreatly extended in order to cover the needs of auxiliaries serving on Ack Acksites, balloon sites and on radio location. An extension of numbers is likely inthese operations. They are inevitably situated in small groups and often,though not always, in remote sites. Members who have visited these sites havebeen impressed with the spirit in which the girls are doing substitution work ol
-eal value and their cheerful acceptance of rough conditions. But we also thinkthat before the coming winter every effort should be made to increase comfortsad amenities, so far as circumstances permit. Here as elsewhere the initiativerests with the officer, and it is not always clear that a young officer with bu&apos;t afew months&apos; experience of service life is fully acquainted with the technique often a clamorous technique necessary to obtain comforts. Also at this stage of the war many are in short supply.16S. These small and isolated detachments raise in somewhat acute formthe whole problem of welfare organisation described in Section VI. Thecounty welfare scheme, as we have shown, is very uneven in its applicationeven in the Army, and is largely overlooked by the Air Force and Navy. Butlocal organisation is urgently needed to deal with the problem of women onisolated sites. Further it must be organisation in responsible hands, for muchiof the work is confidential and access to the staiions difficult to obtain for security reasons.169. Some of us have been much impressed by the value of an experimentto meet this particular need of which the Y.M.C.A. and the Y.W.C.A. werepioneers. This consists of the provision of a van which, in addition to acanteen, acts as a mobile club. The van is equipped with a cinema projector,gramophone records, handicraft materials and music for community singing.On the principle of bringing the mountain to Mahomet, it takes club facilities to women and girls in isolated districts who would otherwise have no enter tain-ment. The van is staffed by two or three helpers and having arrived at thestation, regular club work is carried on during the afternoon or evening crafts,music, play readings, the latter being very popular. Incidentally it suppliesvarious small articles which cannot be bought owing to the absence of shops.Warm appreciation of the mobile club and its value to the women has been expressed to us and would appear to be one of the best methods for dealingwith the welfare of small sites. We think every encouragement should begiven to the Y.W.C.A. or any other member of the Council of Voluntary WarWork who is in a position to carry on this excellent experiment as a regulareducational service and that grants should be made for the purpose. Wehave already referred to the large and miscellaneous service funds available for&quot; comforts,&quot; and provision from this source should surely be possible to meetthe needs of small Service units who are unable to provide for themselves,but have special claims in virtue of their work and the conditions under whichit is done. Any development of mobile club vans must for the reasons already stated be put under responsible management, but with good direction, localsympathy and help might be mobilised in aid of small sites and their needs.Local organisations, Churches, W.V.S., Women&apos;s Institutes, could be en-couraged to adopt a station and provide funds and amenities such as extrawoollies, sea boot stockings, etc., which are very necessary in order to counter-act the hardships created by ice, snow and mud. An adoption scheme wouldprobably lead to an extension of private hospitality and invitations to Servicewomen to share in the social gatherings of the neighbourhood. Boredom andisolation, the enemies of all good work, would be kept at bay by suchmethods. The importance of a good supply of books is dealt with in anotherpart of this Report.Activities of the Soldiers&apos;, Sailors&apos; and Airmen&apos;s Help Society170. Several organisations whose normal work is concerned with the in-tercsts of serving men have taken on extra commitments in order to helpwomen in the Forces, among them the Soldiers&apos;, Sailors&apos; and Airmen&apos;s HelpSociety. On the recreational side this Society has given grants for furnishingrecreation rooms at camps and stations.   They also found that many Service
girls attending courses in London had no friends and no facilities for recreation.Arrangements, therefore, were made for such girls to become honorary mcni-bers of the Francis Martin College, where they could join classes in dancing,shorthand and other subjects and where they could meet informally forrefreshments provided by the Association. The Association hopes to extend this practice to other educational establishments.Recreation.171. Facilities for recreation and exercise are in general adequate or morethan adequate on the large stations. For sedentary recreation there are indoorgames; for active recreation dances and outdoor games. Hockey and tennisare popular, sometimes swimming is available. Though there are few womenleading an active service life whose duties do not give them a good deal ofexercise, stations situated in fine natural scenery offer many attractions togood walkers. We are not satisfied that those employed in sedentary dutiestake enough active recreation or that physical training is carried out regularly nor can physical training entirely take the place of voluntary exercise.Women on the small remote sites are not so easily provided with outdoorgames, and here we think the local goodwill should be mobilised to securetennis, hockey and cycling for personnel.Concerts.172. On large stations there is usually a band and excellent concertsare often got up by musical talent among the Service personnel. Wehave admired spirited service bands where the performers were women.Professional entertainment is provided by ENSA (Entertainments NationalService Association) which is the sole source of supply for the Servicesout of public or semi-public funds. Music is supplemented by amateurdramatic shows, Service concert parties, etc. ENSA can and does provideexcellent concerts and entertainments but the quality varies and we havehad criticism of the tone of some performances. This is a point to whichthe Committee trust the ENSA management will give close attention as we feel sure it would be far from their wish to reinforce, however accidentally,the theory that an entertainment for the troops must be on a low level tobe a success. We should also like to suggest to the management that theydo not confine the tours of their good artists to towns where local provisionfor entertainment is already made but the programme should include visits to more remote and isolated stations. Your Committee think it would be agreat advantage if CEMA (Council for the Encouragement of Music and the arts) were also allowed to provide concerts and entertainments for theForces. We think there is ample room- for both organisations without fearof overlapping or duplicating performances. We refer in paragraph 187 tothe assistance CEMA could give to cultural work in camps.Quiet Rooms.173. The gregarious are well catered for by wireless, games, concerts anddances, but more quiet rooms are necessary for women who wish to relaxin their leisure time. The Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes and the voluntary associations&apos; huts usually provide a quiet room for reading andwriting and in some of the camps there are rooms allotted for this purpose.But we think the existing provision is inadequate and should, where possible,be increased.
SECTION XIV.-EDUCATION.Possibilities of Present Situation.174. The State has a greater responsibility to the men and women of theForces than their physical well-being. If recruits are to make their maximum contribution to the national effort, mind and spirit have claims no less urgent than those of the body. Particularly for women this greatdemonstration of national service, of which they form part, is a uniqueexperiment in unique conditions. In this war young women, without distinction of class, have been brought together to share a common lifewhile fulfilling a common duty to their country. They lead a disciplinedexistence, fed, housed, clothed by the State. Amusement, recreation,names, dances, are catered for liberally; the ail pervasive influence of thecinema and the wireless is to be found in every camp. But it is difficultnot to feel a great opportunity is being missed in another direction.175. The major problem which lies ahead of society is how to reconcilein a highly mechanised world the quality and free expression of the individualwithin the framework of the co-operative State. The British charactermakes the adjustments none too easy, but the middle path has to be foundalong which organisation and individuality can walk together hand in hand.Service life, with its common tasks, common duties, common amusements, isa training place in the subordination of the individual to the whole. Butthe whole can have no richness unless interpenetrated by the quality and variety of the individual human beings who compose it.176. The mingling of all classes in the present national effort is a situa-tion full of promise for the future. Viewed from this standpoint, the campsrepresent a great social experiment no less than a great military effort.Experiences previously unknown on one side and the other have been ex-changed and shared. Camp life too is a great discipline in give and take, andin the sharing of the ups and downs of a common existence. From soil thusploughed a rich harvest may be gathered. But the seed must first be sownand it calls for the hand of a wise and skilful sower.Facilities provided for the Services.177. The men and women in the Forces tc-day represent all types and every stage of intellectual development. The trained mind and the whollyundeveloped mind are found side by side. Intellectual interests, vocationalinterests, general interests,. and a great irresponsive block of no interests at all, constitute the field for which the authorities have to cater. Generaleducation is provided for in each Service through directorates inthe Army, Navy and Air Force. The War Office organisation appears to bethe most fully developed of the three, and it is to be congratulated on theimagination and enthusiasm which mark this branch of its work. Army educa-tion has two divisions the Army Educational Corps under the Directorate of army Education, through which specialist staffs are appointed for Commands,Areas or Divisions; and the Army Bureau of Current Affairs popularly knownas ABCA. Officers are appointed to be responsible, in addition to their normalduties, for looking after the educational interests of the unit. It is their busi-ness to find out what the men and women want and to advise them of thefacilities available. A woman has been appointed on the staff of the Directorof Education at the War Office and A.T.S. officers with the rank of JuniorCommander are being appointed at each Command to encourage education.178. Organisation on very much the same lines obtains in the Air Force, and education is provided for in the Navy though life at sea naturally compels a
different technique for the men. In the R.A.F. education officers are appointedat all the large stations and these officers are specially instructed to find out the educational needs of the W.A.A.F., and to meet them as far as possible.W.A.A.F. officers or N.C.Os. may be nominated to assist the education officer.The general education scheme for women provides for instruction on the stationfor instruction at local schools, correspondence courses, and outside lectures. Aspecial officer has been appointed on the VV.A.A.F. staff to stimulate education.The W.R.N.S. also have a woman staff officer who is detailed for educationalwork. Technical studies are carried on by certain ratings. At many basesclasses have been organised with the help of the Local Education Authorities.179. Valuable pioneer work has been done by the Army in the creation ofthe Army Bureau of Current Affairs, a new and original development in adulteducation. The widespread ignorance about current affairs in the Army hadattracted the attention of ail thoughtful regimental officers. Many men had not-even an elementary idea of why the country was at war. Yet, clearly a man who understands what he is fighting for, fights better than a man who doesn&apos;t.ABCA came into existence in September, 1941, to remedy this ignorance and to mitigate boredom; an insidious disease calculated to attack a large armystationed at home. It was a daring innovation because it demanded that thework should be carried on not by trained teachers but by regimental officers who have found it a valuable means of developing interesting contacts withtheir men. Officers are supplied weekly with two alternate News Bulletins, onecalled Current Affairs, the other War. These bulletins, which are admirablycompiled, give concise information respectively about the course of the war and current topics and also direction on how to conduct a discussion. From thesynopsis thus prepared the officer in charge is expected to give a short prelirnin-ary talk and open the subject for discussion by the men. It is further laiddown that Current Affairs talks should be given in training time, not free time.ABCA is stirring new depths of interest among the men of all educationalexperiments in the Services, it is the most hopeful and the most alive, butthough in theory it applies to the A.T.S. as well as to the Army, its operation is still comparatively rare. Neither the Air Force nor the Navy operatesABCA officially but both receive and use the bulletins in certain places.180. Each Service has its own organisation, but in addition, the educationalresources of the whole country are mobilised for the benefit of all three underthe Central Advisory Council for Adult Education in H.M. Forces which includes representatives from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, the Board ofEducation and Local Authorities, the Universities and voluntary bodies. TheCouncil works through 23 Regional Committees, each based on a University orUniversity College and serving the Forces stationed within its extramural area.It enlists the service of panels of lecturers on a wide range of subjects, bothgeneral and specialised, cultural and social. It deals with units large and small, adapting the instruction to the needs of the particular group. Cone-spondence courses have been arranged for men and women working for pro-fessional qualifications whose studies have been interrupted by the war. It isfundamental that the civilian tutor should work in close co-operation with theservice education officer, supplementing but never superseding his work.Instruction in technical and commercial subjects is given by the Services who can call in the co-operation of the Local Education Authorities. The Y.M.C.A.and Y.W.C.A. carry on educational work in their centres inside and outsidethe camps.Indifference to Education.181. So far as facilities and organisation are concerned, it will be seen thatthe Authorities provide generously for any educational demand made on themby the men and women of the Services.   But it would be idle to pretend that
220c. *, demand is in any respect equal to the possible supply. The homely adagebout the provision of water and the difficulties that arise over its use, recursunfortunately too frequently to the mind of a visitor to a service camp. ManyU ldiers, like many civilians, have an abysmal ignorance of national and international affairs. If men are apathetic about education, women are more&apos;-&quot; The word &quot; education &quot; unfortunately excites little enthusiasm amonglarge sections of young people. The measure of their reaction towards whatmain&apos; of them obviously regard as tiresome pedagogy is the measure of out failure during recent years to get the real thing across to them. Education ast great adventure, as an adventure which makes life infinitely more attractiveand exciting is an appeal which falls too often on uncomprehending ears.Many young minds, coerced or cajoled over the fence of School Certificate,recoil subsequently from any suggestion which carries with it recollections ofpAass-rooms and text-books. They regard the words &quot; further education &quot; as&apos;the dreary slogan of a salesman whose goods cannot hope to compete withthe superior attractions provided by the cinema, the wireless and the internalcombustion engine.1S2. It is a melancholy reflection on the educational failures of the last25 years that many young people refuse to use their minds at all outsideworking hours, and their only cry is for amusement which can be producedwithout any demand made on their initiative, industry or intelligence. It isdoubly melancholy when members of the Committee are told over and overaoain that any educational activity in a camp must be disguised as recreationand made bright and amusing, if women are to be coaxed into attendance.183. &quot; Talks can be slipped unobtrusively into the domestic evening without an apparent loss of free time to anyone &quot; says an official circular apologetically.The inference that amusement is sacred and nothing must be allowed to inter-fere with the hours devoted to the cinema and dance hall is an alarming sidelight on the outlook of the older no less than of the younger generation. Thedifficulties of service education in the present war have thrown into highrelief this dangerous and disturbing state of affairs; dangerous because the oath of the would-be tyrant is smoothed by intellectual apathy in the mass;disturbing because the bread and circus spirit even among kindly and harm-less people is; a poor weapon in a great crisis when compared with the fiercedriving force of a bad ideal.184. Youth cannot be held responsible for this state of affairs.   The warj has shown there is nothing wrong with the fibre of the race, young and old.! Apart from the splendid record of the Services, youth has proved its worth inblitz and bombardment when confronted by desperate need.   But in pre-warI days leadership failed a young people who still depend more perhaps than they realise on the outlook of their elders, and who were left by the latter withoutany heroic appeal either to their imagination or sense of duty.   Many of the younger generation, especially women, suffer greatly from the dislocation ofthe war and the sweeping away of home life to-day and of security in thefuture.   We owe them what compensation in us lies for the state of the world as.it is to-day.1185. This report contains many references to the pressure under whichtheWomen&apos;s Services were built up. Indifference to education is not peculiar to any one class in this country, and in view of the general attitude, it is not surprising that few officers, occupied as they have been with urgent practical problems, have felt little urge to turn their attention to the ploughing of anunpromising fallow. There are, of course, exceptions. Here and there, theCommittee has.heard of classes being held in French and German, and girlsengaged on operational work often show great keenness in perfecting them-selves in the technique of their job.   The eager attention, of classes, where
interest and imagination have been gripped, has a moral all its own. Butgenerally speaking, an atmosphere of complete indifference about educationalmatters overhangs the Women&apos;s Services. &quot; The girls aren&apos;t interested &quot;&quot; No one would come to classes if they were held &quot;. &quot; Ihe girls have too much to do &quot;, are phrases to which members of the Committee have listenedover and over again when visiting the various units. In the phraseology 0fthe hour, &quot; nothing doing &quot; is written over the whole subject.Proposals for Stimulation of Interest.186. Your Committee are not prepared to acquiesce in this defeatistattitude about a matter so intimately concerned with the great issues of thepresent and future. We cannot accept the inference that women areunintelligent as a sex and unable to respond to an appeal to the fine^values of life. We feel it would be an undeserved reproach to the young\womanhood of the country to relegate them, as this theory tacitly relegatesthem, to an intellectual level which finds its stimulus alone in amusement or insome form of training with a career value. Least of all, can we accept theexcuse that the girls have too much to do. Hours of work in the Services are relatively short in many, though not all, of the trades, and the Committee havebeen frequently struck by the large amount of leisure time at the disposal of the rank and file. The trouble is lack of interest not lack of time. We fully recog-nise the difficulties of the position and the great load of indifference which hasto be met and overcome. But we feel strongly that every effort in this senseshould be made. In R. L. Stevenson&apos;s words the world is so full of a numberof things that royal happiness waits on those who realise that a treasure houselies about them. Your Committee refuse to believe that granted the rightapproach, appreciation of history, literature, music and art, is beyond tiereach of many Service women. So far from being dubbed highbrow, such sub-jects often prove surprisingly popular in camps.187. An active education officer will enlist local talent of good quality when-ever available for concerts, and here and there residents may be found com-petent and willing to give talks on a wide range of subjects. We think that theco-operation of C.E.M.A. would be valuable in any attempt to supply culturalneeds in a camp. Music is admirably dealt with in all its aspects by C.E.M.A.artists, so too is drama. Small travelling art exhibitions also fall within theprovince of this Council, and could for the time being transform a mess roominto a centre of artistic discussion. Every type of citizen within certain age groups is to be found in the Forces, and in a serious educational effort no side ismore valuable than the satisfaction cf the claims made by beauty in her manyvaried aspects on ordinary men and women. It is for this, among other reasons, that we desire to see the full co-operation of C.E.M.A. enlisted forcultural work in the camps and urge that all facilities to this end should be thrown open to the Council.188. Your Committee realise that the conditions of service life, with opera-tiona.1 duties and the constant shifting of personnel which takes place, makecourses of regular study difficult if not impossible. What is needed is someintellectual stimulus to rouse thought and interest among the women who, no less than the men, will have in future to carry the burdens of the peace. &quot; It issurely important to bring home to these women what we are fighting for andthe sort of world into which we are moving &apos;&apos; was the remark made by a keenand thoughtful education officer to one of us,&apos; and we concur most heartily inthis sentiment.189. Well-planned talks given by speakers accustomed to adult audiencesoffer the best &quot;approach. We were struck by the fact that in any camp wherethe education officer is an enthusiast he develops enthusiasm around him, and
mmthough numbers may not be large, they are eminently worth while. Popularlectures often attract a full house if the speaker is known to tire audience andliked by them. The number of speakers of this type available is far below therequirements of the Services if all units set out to cater for education, and an approach through the officers is essential if educational needs in this broad senseare to he met. We dealt with this question in so far as it affects the training0f officers in paragraph 63.190. &quot; We may not hope to go to heaven in feather beds &quot;, wrote sir thomas More four centuries ago, &quot; it is not the way &quot;. Education in its realsense of out-drawing should never be easy. Equally, it should never be dull.We stand to-day at a great moment in Fate, between the past and the future.Once again the Sybil approaches with her books and. offers a choice a choicewhich grows more costly at each refusal. The gathering together in the Forcesjf the younger generation is an opportunity which may never recur, a by-product of hope from the devil&apos;s crucible. There are things to unlearn andfalse idols to dethrone. But the chance if seized may sweep the whole nationalexistence from backs and shallows into the great waters of the main.191. But pious expressions of opinion and ideals are one thing; organisation will be necessary to give them concrete shape. We recommend, therefore, that according to the varying needs of the three Services an adequate number ofwomen of suitable rank and relevant experience be appointed as educationofficers in the field to ascertain the outlook and requirements of the rank and file and stimulate interest among the officers of the Women&apos;s Forces. Thenumber of women education officers is at present too few and their rank is nothigh enough to enable them to function to the best advantage. We recommendfurther that the curricula of the officers&apos; training courses and of refresher coursesshould be placed on a broader basis; that the ABC A scheme should be invari-ably applied in the A.T.S. and should be extended to the W.A.A.F. and theW.R.N.S.; that crafts should be encouraged for those whose tastes lie in practical directions and that CEMA should be asked to co-operate in thegenera! development of music, drama and the arts.SECTION XV.-BOOKS.192. The quality and quantity of books in a camp are matters closely related to the presence or absence of any educational interest in the unit. Many facili-ties exist for obtaining literature. The county libraries will co-operate when asked and circulate boxes of well-chosen volumes in their areas. Penguinand paper-backed books can be bought from the Services Central Book Depot.Voluntary organisations, such as the W.V.S. and the Y.W.C.A., also providebooks and travelling libraries in some districts. The difficulty lies not somuch with the supply as with the frequent absence of any interest.193. The variation in interest is seen by the experience of the W.V.S. Inone area the education officer asked them to run a cultural centre in conjunctionwith a library that had been started. In another area so much use was madeof the travelling boxes by the men in the Forces that it had not been possibleto spare any for the women. In yet another area the offer of the travellinglibrary boxes was not accepted as no one would take the responsibility forreturning the books in reasonable condition.194. Libraries so called exist in most camps and of many of these we have formed a very poor impression. They consist too often of old and tatteredcopies of inferior novels which have been discarded by their owners and area very indifferent compliment to the presumed intelligence of&apos; the recipients.\y- t. helves decorated with obsolete encyclopaedias calculated to misleadany earnest searcher after truth. Such volumes best serve the national cause by
consignment to the pulping machine. On the other hand, when there is akeen education officer his influence makes itself felt by the presence of g00cimodern books on the shelves.195. Books do not exist in a vacuum. They are ancillary to the generaleducational level. Some direction is necessary to encourage serious reading,and fiction; which naturally is mostly in demand, varies greatly in quality, agood amateur librarian and there are many women in the Services competent to till that role-will know how to cater for all tastes and yet maintain a certainstandard which never deteriorates into cheapness. The development of hospital libraries since the last war has shown what can be done in thisdirection. If, as \vc hope, more efforts may be made to stimulate interest incultural matters and current affairs in the Women&apos;s Services, the reactionon the demand for books will be immediate. Organisation of the supply,would then not prove difficult.SECTION XVI-RELIGION.196. &quot; Where there is no vision the people perish &quot;. Your Committeecannot omit in this report reference to a matter we consider of fundamental importance, not only to those serving in the Forces but to the whole nation.The ordinary facilities are given to service women to practise the religion oftheir denomination. Chaplains representing the various churches are postedin large units and small stations are served by the local clergy. Services are usually held every Sunday and church parades compulsory or semi-compulsoryare also held regularly.197. We find it very difficult to arrive at any assessment of the delicatequestions concerned with the influence of religion in service life. The personalequation is paramount here. We have been in camps where the influenceor the Chaplain makes itself felt throughout the ranks, an influence which is evident even to a visitor. We were interested to hear of the number ofconfirmations which take place under a personal guidance of this kind. Wehave been in other camps where the whole spiritual life was dead and inertand apart from conventional church parades, there was no collective religiouslife. We refrain from commenting on this position which unfortunately is not peculiar to the Services. We are satisfied, however, that granted the righttype of approach there are many women in the Services who appreciatereligious teaching and respond gladly to its appeal. On one large airfield asmall and beautiful sanctuary for private prayer kept in perfect order bythe airwomen and so we were told in constant use, proves the existenceamong some at least of a spirit at the poles removed from indifference aboutspiritual things. Everything turns, however, on the wisdom and unstanding of the person by whom the approach is made. Conventional forms of worshiphave little influence with the modern girl, but she has a sure instinct for thespiritual quality of a teacher who has translated his or her faith into the termsof a consecrated life. We have heard, with satisfaction, of the appointment to the A.T.S. of 12 women representatives of the Anglican and Free Churcheswho are to assist the Chaplains in various selected places. We understandthat they have been chosen with great care and have special qualifications forthe task. Attendance at meetings held by them will, of course, be voluntary.The difficulties of religious instruction in a large and mixed community arc toowell known to call for comment and any shadow of pressure must be avoided.We trust the experiment will be a success so that it may be repeated on a larger scale and extended to the other Services.198. Your Committee do not feel it would serve any useful purpose tomake any general recommendations on the subject.   Quality of spirit alone
-ves life and spirit is not susceptible to large scale organisation. The co-S&apos; ralioii 0f the officers, when it exists, is a very valuable element obviously&quot;tich co-operation cannot be laid down or regimented. King&apos;s Regulations\n prescribe church parades but cannot enforce the practice of the Christianlife The best influence will always be oblique a matter of example, notprecept. Officers who cherish their own religious beliefs will naturally have aconcern for the provision of similar facilities for their women. But apartfrom any personal factor of this kind, it should be clearly understood that noobstacles in the way of routine duties should be placed in the path of a girlwho desires to carry on the practice of her religion. Girls, no less than otherneople, are subject to the great unsettlement of spirit which distracts the world to-day.&apos; Service life has its difficulties and temptations, and opportunity should not be denied to those who find strength in religion.SECTION XVII.-SERVICE LIFE AND MORALS.jog. Virtue has no gossip-value. It has been one of the tasks of your committee to form some conclusion as to why the Women&apos;s Services have incurred so much criticism. Anyone who has visited a Service camp and haswatched the auxiliaries at work and at play; who has noted their trim andsoldierly bearing, their good discipline and high spirit, can only marvel at theunfriendly comments often current. A reasoned judgment in this matter is not easy. Prejudice, exaggeration and truth are all factors of which your committee are conscious in any summing up of the position. Certain obscurebut nevertheless real psychological reactions must, in the first place, be noted.200. The British, though they fight when called upon to do so with unfalter-inf courage and determination, are not a military race. They cherish a deep-rooted prejudice against uniforms; consequently a woman in uniform mayrouse a special sense of hostility, conscious and sub-conscious, among certainpeople who would never give two thoughts to her conduct as a private citizen.The&apos; woman in uniform becomes an easy target for gossip and careless talk.To be seen drinking a glass of beer in a public-house is to provide a text forfluent remarks about the low standards of the Services. Further, though theservice rendered to their country by the women is generally recognised thereare exceptions and critics both within and without the Forces. Strictures inparticular from soldiers, sailors and airmen, small minority though theymaybe, carry weight out of proportion to their numbers, and may be repeated,often with exaggerations, since no story loses in the telling.201. War gives rise to many rumours. Vague and discreditable allegationsabout the conduct -of women in the Forces have caused considerable distressand anxiety not only to friends and relations at home but to men fightingoverseas. Some of these tales have suggested a high rate of illegitimate preg-nancy, :pthers that excessive drinking is a common practice. Individualinstances of such pregnancy, of course, occur, but information is availablewhich demonstrates on what slender foundations a superstructure of scandalhas been reared. Your Committee realise that the public may ask whatstatistical evidence is available to support their statement that allegations ofimmorality in the Services have little or no foundation. We have made carefulenquiries of all camps we have visited (A.T.S., W.A.A.F. and W.R.N.S. alike), and obtained figures of illegitimate pregnancy for the units concerned. these proved to be trifling and your Committee were satisfied from these and otherenquiries that the conclusion at which we had arrived, checked as it was over aperiod of four months by visits to camps in all parts of the country and of varying sizes, was correct. But we are unable to show the conclusion in anygeneral statistical form, as comparable figures for the three Services do not exist and the available figures are not for the same periods or compiled on thesame basis.
202. For the A.T.S., however, we have been supplied with detailed figureson discharges for pregnancy which prove conclusively how little truth there isin the rumour regarding illegitimate pregnancy in that Service. There are inthe A.T.S. large numbers of married women and the pregnancies of thesewomen are often, no doubt, carelessly confused with those of the singlewomen. The pregnancy rate for married women in the A.T.S., accordin&quot; tothe monthly returns for the first live months of this year, ranged from 15 -to 17 per 1,000.203. Turning to unmarried women, the illegitimate birth rate among tj!ncivilian population in the age groups from which A.T.S. are recruited is approximately 21.8 per 1,000 per annum.   The pregnancy rate among singleA.T.S. personnel is 15.4 per 1,000 per annum.   It must be remembered thatpregnancy and birth rate statistics are not identical for a woman in the Services or in any other occupation discharged for pregnancy may subsequent^miscarry.   No information is available as to what proportion the 21.8 birtlKper 1,000 among the civilian population bear to total pregnancies, nor what proportion of the 15.4 pregnancies per 1,000 in the A.T.S. result in birthsBut it is clear that if comparable figures could be arrived at the gap wouldbe wider.   The comparison too is between a civilian figure calculated onfemale population covering certain age groups and A.T.S. personnel of aoegroups, which though comparable, are much more heavily weighted on the younger side.   There is a further important point to be taken into account a number of single women come into the Forces already pregnant.   Accord-ing to the monthly returns for the first five months of this year of single women who were discharged for pregnancy, the percentage who were pregnant beforeentering the A.T.S. ranged from 18 per cent, to 44 per cent.204. We are satisfied from our enquiries that if comparable and detailed figures for the W.A.A.F. and the W.R.N.S. were available they would prove that any allegations as to high illegitimate pregnancy in those Services were equally unfounded. We can, therefore, with certainty, say that the illegitimatebirth rate in the Services is lower than the illegitimate birth rate among the comparable civilian population.205. It may be said that pregnancy figures are, in themselves, inconclusiveas to standards of morality. The use of contraceptives of recent years hasspread through all classes of society and sexual intercourse may be commonwithout pregnancy resulting. Standards of sexual behaviour have changedgreatly in the last generation and some people to-day conduct their lives on principles remote from those termed Victorian. The reticencies and inhibition;of the Victorian period have been swept away to be replaced by frank and open discussion about matters formerly regarded as unmentionable. There isa certain bravado in much talk that takes place between young people aboutsex questions and theories arc often paraded in conversation which are neverput into practice. Shock tactics used against the shibboleths and conventionsof their elders may prove good fun for the younger generation, but it is norsurprising if the latter sometimes find themselves taken at their word.206. Similarly with drinking. Though statistics show a steady fall indrunkenness, liquor flows, not necessarily to excess, in a volume unknown inthe past. In recent years cocktail parties, bottle parties, road houses, publichouses and bars cater for the taste of every stratum of society. Alcohol hasbecome a symbol of conviviality for women no less than men and has seta standard of social intercourse among people of all ages. Repeated rounds oicocktails involve a substantial consumption of spirits and they are drunk by many girls, who at heart, would prefer a soft drink but fear to be dubbed &quot;nota sport &quot; if they ask for lemonade or ginger beer. Though there maybelittle drinking to excess or of the drinking that ends in a police court, the
223habit of drinking is more widespread. Further, too much drink does notncourage fine manners or special courtesy from man to woman, and often leads to a certain amount of horse play. Consequently men and women in uniformlaughing and talking noisily in a bar together make a very bad impression onan onlooker though there may be nothing undesirable in their relations.oq-j. Your Committee are not a Committee of morals, and it is not part ofour duty to pass judgment on these changes in social behaviour. We are,however, concerned to point out that the Women&apos;s Services, which have now reached a considerable figure, to-day represent a cross section of the population and all types and standards are represented among them. The innocent andthe experienced, girls from good and girls from bad homes, are all throwntogether. If a woman has learnt loose habits in civilian life, she brings thosehabits with her into the Services.   Her uniform at once makes her conductDnspkuous. Recruits with good standards of behaviour but often with littleexperience of the world may generalise from a particular case in their talkat home and among their friends and easily give a wrong impression. In&apos;civilian life cases of immorality are spread over a wide area; in the Servicesthey occur in small compact communities and are at once concentrated andconspicuous. Unfortunately gossip mongers, who spread unsavoury rumours,never stop to reflect on such abstract and unpicturesque details as incidence andratio which would reduce the stories they put into circulation to their justproportion. Allegations of general immorality in a camp, when investigated,have in our experience, resolved themselves into one or two cases which, in thecourse of gossip, have been muliipled times over. And the same applies to charges of drunkenness.208. The point your Committee desire to stress is that loose behaviour, whenit occurs, is not necessarily the product of service life; it is introduced primarilyfrom without. Service life, with its discipline, work and good comradeship,generally speaking puts the relation of men and women on a healthy andnormal basis. It is a corrective rather than an incitement to bad conduct.There may be at times emotional stresses due to the war which lead to extramarital relationships. The incidence of such relationships or other examples of unsatisfactory behaviour is not easy to determine, but no conclusion would bemore false than to imagine that they are typical of the Services as a whole.209. The general impression made by the auxiliaries on the members in theirvisits to camps was excellent. We can find no justification for the vaguebut sweeping charges of immorality which have disturbed public opinion, and inthis we are supported by representatives of the various welfare organsationsand the Chaplains who are in constant touch with the girls. We have takencareful evidence on this point and find that, in the opinion of those mostcompetent to form a reasoned judgment, promiscuous conduct in the Women&apos;sSendees is confined to a small proportion of the whole. On the other hand,constant tributes were paid to the good work and discipline of the women andthe courage and cheerfulness they display. We consider that these allegationsreflect most unfairly as a generalisation on a body of women,- the vast majority. of whom are serving their country in a high and self-respecting spirit Yourt Committee can only deplore the irresponsible conduct of persons who, without* any first-hand knowledge, are content to damage the war effort by maliciousor careless talk derogatory to the Forces of the Crown. These tales aredeeply wounding to auxiliaries who have the honour of their Service and theiruniform very much at heart, and are no less bitterly resented by their malecolleagues. Further, apart from the alarm and distress caused to manyparents, slanderous gossip has a very adverse effect on recruiting.210. It is not without interest to note that in 1918 wild and fantastic taleswere in circulation about the immorality of the W.A.A.C.s in France; tales
almost identical in substance with those current about the Wonien&apos;s services during the present war. A Commission of Enquiry which- visited Francereported that, apart from some cases of misconduct, the charges as generalisa-,tions were mischievous and false. Then, as now, a vast superstructure ofslander had been raised on a small foundation in fact.SECTION XVIII.-WOMAN POWER.2ii. The question of woman power was brought to the attention of y0UrCommittee many times in the course of the enquiry. We have met withallegations of under-employment in all three Services, and it was stated fromtime to time that recruits were not doing a full day&apos;s work. On the other hand,we have found evidence of overwork in some categories. This is not a matterabout which we are in a position to pronounce a reasoned judgment. All war.effort, whether in the field or in the factories, is liable to alternate periods (J\rush and standing by. Service establishments are necessarily based on theneeds of a period of activity and during a lull under-employment may occur.How far units we visited had personnel constantly under-employed, it was notpossible for us to determine. Our investigations were concerned with amenities and conditions in the camps and were conducted on general lines. Our termsof reference did not authorise us to examine in detail, hours of work, schedulesof employment, and a comparison between the past experience of recruits andthe trade in which they are now engaged. Enquiry on these lines wouldhave held up the publication of the Report and, in our opinion, to be satisfac-tory should, if the need for such enquiry exists, be undertaken by trainedinvestigators.212. It has, however, been stressed during the course of the enquiry howrrgeiit the demand for woman power is and the need for more recruits lor theForces to replace men for combatant work. We have formed the impression that mobile women are being used in all three Services for work for whichimmobile and part-time civilian labour could be employed, for instance, in pay and record offices. We think that the position in all three Services calls for review and that, when such a review is undertaken, special attention should be.given to the immobile units in the W.R.N.S.213. In view of the shortage of woman power it is becoming increasinglynecessary to examine every possible source of supply. There is one pool ofwomen from which both officers and other ranks might be drawn, that is the pool of chadless wives of men serving in the armed forces: If the provision made during the passage of the National Service (No. 2) Act that such women should not be regarded as mobile and posted to the Forces was given becauseof the criticisms current at the time regarding the conditions in the A.T.S. andW.A.A.F., the result of this investigation has shown that conditions in these services now do not result in undue hardship and that the allegations ofimmorality were fantastic. In these circumstances your Committee would suggest a reconsideration of the position.SECTION XIX.-THE FUTURE.214. Your Committee have made a survey in this report of the structure and conditions of the Women&apos;s Services and of the general arrangements for recruitment and maintenance of the auxiliaries. Complaints have been in-vestigated and deficiencies in organisation brought to notice. We do notpretend, nor would the Services pretend, that a hundred per cent, provisionagainst mistakes has been secured for the future. The country is engaged in total war and conditions during a great national struggle cannot be on a peacetime level of comfort and security.   But we must repeat that in so far as
22hardship arises from the exigencies of the war and not from failure in the human element it will be accepted as inevitable by all ranks.15. In cur opinion the best co-operation between men and women-in theServices is secured by a recognition of the different contribution each can make to iiie national effort. Men and women are not identical and interchangeable!jh! complementary; and organisation and discipline to be successful must recognise their fundamental differences while integrating the special contributionthat each has to make. Perfection in any large scale organisation is a patternalways laid up in Heaven, but we could not bring our task to an end withoutplacing on record the high regard which we have learnt to feel for the Women&apos;siServices, officers and other ranks alike, and that, in our opinion, the nationhas every reason to be proud of the women who are sharing the work of thesailors, soldiers and airmen. Men serving abroad should feel a special pride inthe knowledge that their women kind are taking their full share in the nationaleffort.216. What is to be the future of the Women&apos;s Services? When the cease firesounds, is a curtain to fall on the remarkable contribution they have made tothe war? Officers and other ranks naturally at times ask themselves thisquestion and it has forced itself on the attention of your Committee. the uncertainty is affecting the recruiting of young women of the professionalclasses. The auxiliaries, unlike the fighting forces to whom their faithfulservice has been given, have no assured place in the post war world. Calledinto existence by the greatest of all struggles, they have, unlike the Army,no tenacious roots in the social fabric and no background of history ortradition. Trophies of former wars, which tell of past fame and beckon to future service, do not decorate their mess rooms. The war over and the imme-diate task of substitution finished, are the auxiliaries&quot;to vanish from the sceneand be lost in the shadows of demobilisation?217. It is agreed on every side that the rapid and haphazard demobilisation of ffie last war, which was made without due regard to the re-entry of menand women into civilian employment, must not be allowed to recur. the adjustments as between the claims of the sexes will be intricate and difficult;relative sacrifices have to be weighed but the claim of the women to just andgenerous treatment when the time comes is one no Government can overlook.Few matters have struck us more forcibly in the course of this enquiry thanthe tributes pair by Commanding Officers and others to the efficiency anddevotion of women doing highly skilled technical and engineering jobs.Praise of their delicate and accurate touch as operators was matched by praisefor their conscientious fulfilment of duty. There is no wealth but work andthe nation has found new riches in this great development of skilled capacitycreated by the war.218. Many women, of course, have only one wish, namely to go home atthe end of the war. For others an interrogation mark hangs over the future.Some joined the Services in a spirit of adventure, some have careers to whichthey can return, some threw up good jobs at the call of duty. But, thoughpersonal questions arise, it is primarily regret for the waste involved, whichthoughtful auxiliaries feel at the prospect of any immediate break up of theWomen&apos;s Services. Effort and sacrifice no less than time and money went totheir creation. Daily their efficiency increases, viewed merely from the mechanical standpoint.   Has the State no further use for them?219. Your Committee, who have seen for themselves in camps and stations and outposts the work of the women in many varied circumstances, can onlysympathise with this feeling. The question whether a nucleus of the Women&apos;sCorps should be kept in being on a peace footing after the war is one of highpolicy beyond the limits of our terms of reference.   But it is our hope that
&quot;when the time comes, the demobilisation of a nation in arms and its remobili-sation for the campaigns of peace will take place with due regard both to the tasks ahead and the personnel available. It is at this point we feel a channel of opportunity might open before the auxiliaries.220. The personnel of the Wornen&apos;s Services is unique. The auxiliariesto-day consist of large bodies of trained and disciplined women working under their officers and equipped to carry out a variety of tasks, domestic, clerical,technical. In them the nation possesses an instrument of great potentialusefulness. We should like to feel that when their present duties come toah end, their -services might he forthcoming in another field for which their training and experience makes them especially fitted. Hazardous though anyspeculation is at the moment about post war conditions, one thing at leastis certain. We contemplate no end save that of complete victory, but victory&apos;will confront the &quot;United Nations with a devastated world and in particularSwith a starving Europe whose needs will call for immediate help.22i. In the circumstances any rapid restoration of civil government isvery unlikely. A period-of armistice and reconstruction will be necessary inorder to restore the shattered framework of European society. The united nations will have to face a great task of salvage among the victims of the war.As a first step, various missions, among them those concerned with food and clothing, housing and medical assistance, will clearly have to function on theContinent. It is obvious that for a time such missions can only function ona military basis and under the protection of the armed forces engaged in therestoration of order. To meet the needs of the liberated populations and thoseof the armies of occupation, technical staffs will be required throughout europe both for administration and relief. Detachments of the Women&apos;services would, in our opinion, be admirably fitted to share in these duties. AsService units they can be attached without difficulty of any kind to theappropriate occupying establishments. Much of the work to be done is workin which the co-operation of women is not only desirable but essential. that co-operation can be achieved in the irapid and simple form through theorganisation of the auxiliaries for foreign service. Clerks, cooks, drivers,orderlies, will be wanted to carry on day to day duties much as they are carriedon at present. Administrative tasks will exist in plenty for officers-capable of handling the problems of want and suffering which the liberated countries will present. Employment for the time being on the Continent would ease the demobilisation of the Women&apos;s Services and the return of the auxiliaries to civil life.222. There is, of course, a precedent for this employment, detachments ofthe W.A.A.C.s and the W.R.A.F.s having served in Germany in 1919 afterthe armistice. At the conclusion of the last war women stood down withouta murmur from posts they had filled in the absence of the men. A far greaterburden of sacrifice has rested on them in the present war and no one desires to-see the inevitable readjustments press harshly on the women. Far moreimportant, however, in our opinion than any economic^ consideration wouldbe-the moral effect of the above proposal. To associate women with the task of reconstruction in Europe, to call upon them to share in a work of healingahd mercy would be, not only to bring their war duties to a noble conclusion,but fo open a new chapter in international relationships of high value for thefuture. We have no doubt that volunteers would be forthcoming from all theServices should a scheme on some lines as- above suggested prove feasible. Andwe have also no doubt that the auxiliaries would throw themselves with equalenthusiasm into the work and adventure of peace as they show to-day in thework and adventure of war. Our ties with the Continent after the war will necessarily be intimate.   Englishwomen, who have worked in the track of the
stormtionexpand have played their part in the succour of the sorely strickenwill return, home increased in ,stature as citizens. Knowledge andjricnce thus gained could only be of value to themselves and others in theremodelling of a world w which all are groping towards some practical expres-sion of the old truth that we are verily members one of another, united bv ties of past suffering and. a larger hope for the future: &apos;^^f^nl^f^^f^^^  RECOMMENDATIONS.223- The following is&apos;a summary of recommendations.   ,We wish however to point out thatconchtions are changing ;rapidly in the Women&apos;s Services andthat many improvements have been made during the past six months or are on the point.of being carried out.   It is possible, therefore, that effect will&apos; ve neen gi - -. .&apos; inereport.nven to some of our recommendations before the publication of organisation. n(i) As many basic principles as possible should be adhered to for the three\Vomen&apos;s Services and in particular uniform standards laid down for recruit-meht, accommodation, clothing, discipline.   (Paragraph 36.)(2) The recruitment of officers should be stimulated, by: .(i) further recruitment from the ranks;(ii) further recruitment of women with specialist qualifications for emergency commissions;-  I    .(iii) more.publicity through the Appointments Offices of the Ministryof Labour and National Service with the help of the University Appoint-ments Boards and the Services to bring to the fore the need for goodofficer material, and,to;give publicity to a policy of accelerated promotionfor suitable candidates.   (Paragraph 56;)(3) Older and- more experienced officers, generally speaking, should be allocated to remote sites. (Paragraph 60.) Too frequent movement of officers should be avoided.   (Paragraph 67.).(4) The age of retirement should be raised to 55 for Chief Commanders and officers of lower rank inTthe A-T-S^aTid equivalent ranks in the W.A.A.F.The same principle should apply to the W.R.N.S.   (Paragraph 60.)(5) Officers&apos;&quot; training should be on a broader basis and the course extended by two weeks. (Paragraph 65.) The opening of an O.C.T.U. for theW.A.A.F; should be expedited.   (Paragraph 66.)(6) The number of inspectors on the staff of the Director, A.T.S., should beincreased. Women Directors and their deputies in all three Services shouldbe free to visit without prior notice. ; (Paragraph 41.)(7) There should be a greater degree of delegation to Commands and groups of postings and cross postings in the A.T.S. and the W.A.A.F.   (Paragraph^co-n rijl-jsarl miolrriti-m-snkpujt od! olnr/ia yrf bluorla noiis-mbisnoO issj.(8) More women should be used to replace male officers of the Navy, Army,and Air Force, in the,,three Government Departments, Command and otherstatic headquarters, arid in such branches of the Army as the R.A.S.C. andR.A.P.C. and their equivalents in the other Services.   (Paragraph 54.)(9) Further disciplinary powers are required; equal disciplinary powers andpunishments should obtain for the three Sendees. (Paragraph 69.) The num-ber of A.T.S. police should be. increased. . (Paragraph 70.)(10) To increase.the supply of mobile women, the immobile units of.theW.R-.N.S. should be examined;: the possibility of use of immobiles and part-time civilian labourdn the;pay and record roffices of the three Services shouldbe considered; and theipresent position of childless wives of men serving in theForces should be reviewed. .; (Paragraphs 211 and 212.)
(n) No undertaking should be given on choice of employment or postingnear home, but where posting near home can be done without dislocation of the  normal machinery, such arrangements should be effected. (Paragraphs149 and 155.)(12) An explanation should be given to new recruits of their right and duties and the reasons for rules and regulations.   (Paragraph 68.)(13) With the sub-division of Army Command Areas into Army Corps and army Districts, there should be, in addition to the Deputy Director, A.T.S. atCommand, a woman staff officer at each Army Corps and District Head-quarters.   (Paragiaph 46.)(14) The component system already operating in the mixed heavy anti-aircraft batteries could with advantage be applied in large static units wheresubstantial number-5 of A.T.3. are employed. Where, however, there are smalland scattered groups of women the organisation should be dett^rmined by loc,- ^circumstances.   (Paragraph 51.)(15) Close liaison should be maintained with the Director A.T.S. on all matters affecting women&apos;s interests in connection with mixed heavy anti-aircraft batteries and to this end the Deputy Director A.T.S. at Anti-aircraft command should be made a member of the Directors Council. (Paragraph52-)(16) The Air Ministry organisation for the W.A.A.F. should be broughtmore into line with that obtaining in the War Office for the A.T.S. W.A.A.F.staff officers should be appointed to such directorates in the Air Ministryas deal with matters affecting the W.A.A.F.   (Paragraph 39.)(17) Consideration should be given to the possibility of reorganising thework of the women group officers in the W.A.A.F. on a compact geographicalbasis.   (Paragraph 47.)(18) The number of women officers at R.A.F. stations should be determined,as far as possible, by the actual personnel of the W.A.A.F. at the station and not by establishment; their grading should be related to the total numberof women at a station.   (Paragraph 55.)(19) Consideration should be given to the possibility of securing for theW.A.A.F. combined reception and training centres for all recruits and whererecourse need not be had to billeting.   (Paragraph 157.)Medical.(20) The two special medical boards for volunteers for the A.T.S. andW.A.A.F. should be discontinued.   (Paragraph 99.)(21) The W.R.N.S. should take recruits of the same medical grading as theother two Services. (Paragraph 98.) The practice of the A.T.S. of havingselective intelligence tests prior to medical examination should be adopted bythe W.A.A.F. and the W.R.N.S.   (Paragraph 101.)(22) Consideration should be given to the keeping of uniform health recordsfor all three Services.   (Paragraph 102.)(23) Women doctors should be appointed to reception centres for theW.R.K.S. and to the Naval Commands.   (Paragraph 111); more women-doctors, including gynaecologists, should be appointed for the A.T.S. and theW.A.A.F.   (Paragraphs 109, in, 127.)(24) Women employed by the R.A.F. medical branches as nursing orderliesshould, if capable, be allowed to become student nurses in a recognised train-inn; course and take the examinations for State Registered Nurse. (Paragraphii3Sjji b;m es&amp;&amp; -     -       ;   -    - &apos; .(25) Commanding Officers should constantly review sickness arrangements with special reference to the procedure for sick parades and the treatmentof minor ailments to ensure that instructions are implemented.   (Paragraphs
228( 57o and 106); suitable food should be served to women suffering from minorailments.   (Paragraph 33.)00 A lecture agreed between the medical and educational brancnes shouldue given to recruits in all three Services on the wider implications Lions ot sexbehaviour (Paragraph 118); in the officers&apos; training courses provision shouldhe made for outside lecturers to give lectures and initiate discussion on thesewider implications.   (Paragraph 120.)ton) The Ministry of Health should give immediate attention to the problemof pregnant women. The Ministry should make grants to local authorities and existing voluntary associations for care during pregnancy; they should makefurther3 provision in maternity homes, hospitals and convalescent homes forthe cnnhnement and after-care of mothers, and in residential nurseries forthe children of women desirous of returning to the Forces.   (Paragraph 126.)Accommodation .(28) Living quarters in essentials with equipment and stores should beready before drafts arrive (Paragraph 87); frequent inspection of billets andoversight of requisitioned houses are required to ensure maintenance of standards.   (Paragraphs 81 and 82.)(29) A night latrine of some kind should be provided in an external annexeconnected to sleeping quarters where there is no covered way betweenquarters and latrines.    (Paragraph 88.)(30) Shower baths should invariably be curtained; a few screens should beprovided in each ablutions room to secure privacy, if desired, for the dailywash.  (Paragraph 89.)(31) Stoves should be kept clean and fires should be lit in cold weatherbefore women come off duty.   (Paragraph 91.)(32) The provision of facilities for laundering of personal clothing shouldbe brought up to schedule in all stations.

(Paragraph93.) yd bo;obrm omvisa aidkxun v.   eufi -t63   &quot;. :: llu&apos;-. ! .rM .yic;(34) Pegs should be invariably supplied (Paragraph 82); in view of theshortage of wood, the use of other materials, including plastics, for lockersj should be explored or failing that a handle and padlock for kit bags issued.(Paragraph 95.)Welfare, Conditions of Employment and Education.(35) Arrangements should be made for periodical meetings of local welfare officers to share experience and pool ideas. It would be an advantage ifsuch officers appointed in the future refrained from taking up honorarycommissions and worked as civilians.    (Paragraph 78.)(36) Special attention should be given to the need for amenities on remotesites (Paragraph 167); the mobile club system should be extended and localorganisations encouraged to adopt such sites and to stimulate private hos-pitality (Paragraph 169);- local good will should be mobilised to securetennis, hockey and cycling for personnel.   (Paragraph 171.)(37) Provision should be made for quiet rooms, whenever possible. (Para-graph 173.)(38) Where there is no rest centre near a railway station or junction, afew bunks should be provided in the ladies&apos; waiting rooms for girls waitingTor early morning trains, or the R.T.O. supplied by local organisations withaddresses of women residents who would put up one or two girls in an;emergency.   In large stations R.T.Os. might have a woman.on their staff.I (Paragraph 159.)
(39) More trollies for the provision of tea and refreshment should be provided at main railway stations. (Paragraph 162.)

(40) An issue of physical training kit should be made in the W.A.A.F. and the W.R.N.S. as is the case in the A.T.S. (Paragraph 130.)

(41) During basic training women should be allowed to bring old shoes for alternate wear until the feet are hardened to Service shoes. (Paragraph 128.)

(42) Allowances for the purchase of civilian clothing on discharge should be increased. (Paragraph 131.)

(43) Consideration should be given to a system whereby women on continuous shift work could do the same watch daily for a fortnight before changing over; hours should not exceed 8 a day or 48 a week. Where, however, women are working on shifts in air-conditioned rooms under artificial light, investigation should be made to determine optimum hours and the best shift system applicable in the circumstances; longer breaks are required in the fresh air. (Paragraphs 134 and 136.)

(44) Educational work should be stimulated by the appointment of an adequate number of women of suitable rank and relevant experience as education officers in the field; the extension of the curriculum of the officers&apos; training courses; the invariable application of ABCA to the A.T.S. and its extension to the W.A.A.F. and the W.R.N.S.; the encouragement of crafts and the co-operation of CEMA (Paragraph 191); this Council should also be allowed to give concerts for the entertainment of troops. (Paragraph 172.)

224. We wish in conclusion to express, our appreciation of the help and willing co-operation we have received in the course of the enquiry from the Service Departments and the courtesy and hospitality extended to us during our visits to stations. Our thanks are no less due to the Ministry of Labour and National Service for provision of staff and premises and for seconding the Secretary.

We must express in warmest terms the indebtedness we feel to our Secretary, Mrs. Gulland, for the admirable service rendered by her during the enquiry and in the drafting of the Report. Her efficiency, her powers of rapid work and thorough grasp of the large amount of material with which the Committee had to deal were invaluable to us, and her courtesy, tact and judgment were no less marked in the many personal and official relations to which the enquiry gave rise.

We have the honour to be,

Sir,

Your obedient Servants,
