August 1942.SECRET- Copy No.    2!)W.P. (42) 342.(Also CCS. (42) 368.)August 6, 1942.TO BE  KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.EIRE-SUPPLY OF EQUIPMENT.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.AT. their meeting* on the 27th July, the War Cabinet &quot;Asked the Chiefs of Staff to consider whether, political considerationsapart, it would be in our interest on military grounds to supply Eire withthe limited amount of arms and munitions for which they had asked.&quot;2. At Annex I is a list of the main items of equipment which have been supplied to Eire. *3. At Annex II is a list of the major items of equipment demanded byEire and still outstanding.4. As the likelihood of invasion becomes more remote and the probability of our Forces in Northern Ireland operating in Eire recedes, there is less militaryjustification for passing equipment to Eire. In addition, nearly every item of equipment asked for can only be provided at the expense of our own Forces.5. The Chiefs of Staff therefore recommend that, from the military pointof view, no more arms and equipment should be given to Eire except the minesfor which they ask and a strictly limited amount of equipment which can be spared without detriment to our own requirements, in order to keep relationssweet. The Air Ministry should, however, be allowed to provide sufficientequipment to Eire at their own discretion in exchange for certain useful&apos;concessions which they are able to obtain, mainly through the Eire Army AirCorps, whose disbandment would not be in our interests.(Signed) C.
