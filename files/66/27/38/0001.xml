THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  August 1942.SECRET. Copy, NoW.P. (42) 358.August 13, 1942.WAR CABINET.INDIA AS A FACTOR IN ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I HAVE read with great interest the note by Mr. Graham Spry, circulated bythe Lord Privy Seal No. W.P. (42)/ I am, of course, broadly in agreement withMr. Spry&apos;s conclusions in paragraph 6 of his note that information and propaganda in the United States about British relations with India are theresponsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government. While I agree, also, that there is undoubtedly need for improving and developing our publicity on this subject, Iam satisfied that whatever deficiencies exist are in no way due to inadequateeffort by the British Information Services or the Indian Agency-General (whichlatter was only established a few months ago), but rather to the fact that thetwo organisations, as such, had not until recently been as closely associated with one another in this task as is desirable for the purpose of securing the bestresults. I am glad to say, however, that the closest consultation and collaborationhas been established with Sir G. S. Bajpai since the arrival of Mr. Harold Butler.I have felt for some time that it was desirable to try and establish somebroad working conception of the respective functions of the British InformationService in the United States and those of the Agency-General in relation topublicity on Indian developments, and I have already been in consultation withthe &quot;Minister, of Information, with Mr. Harold Butler, and with the Viceroyon the question. While the view of Mr. Butler is that, for the present, our propaganda in the United States should concentrate on India&apos;s war effort andthe military consequences of the Congress Party&apos;s attitude, yet the constitutionalquestion is always in the background and may at any moment come again tothe front. Although there is a consensus of opinion that whatever distinctionmay be made as a matter of theory no hard and fast division between, or separa-tion of, the spheres of the British Information Service and of the Agent-Generalis possible in practice and that in the last resort any dividing line for workingpurposes must rest on expediency and good understanding between the twoOffices, there is, I think, a broad measure of agreement with my view that,although publicity about and on behalf of India and the Government of India,e.g., about the country, its peoples and economic and social welfare and India&apos;swar effort, would largely, or wholly, fall naturally to the Agent-General, theBritish Information Service must bear responsibility for seeing that there is adequate guidance available to the United States Press, &amp;c, on the constitutionalpolicy and intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards India. Nevertheless,Sir G. S. Bajpai also will be expected by the American Press to deal with this aspect, and it is right and proper that he should do so, though as the repre-sentative of the Government of India and not of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Itis natural that in relation to Indian questions the Agent-General of India should occupy the public stage, but it is in the important function of prompting andinspiration behind the scenes that I conceive that the British Information service would mainly play its part. The provision to the Office of the Agent-General[24221] , -        -
2and to the British Information Service of a full supply of information and of guidance on policy is, of course, the responsibility of the Government of Indiaand of the India Office in co-operation with the Ministry of Information.I am now engaged on working out with those concerned the practical implications of the principle outlined above. The first step, of which the Viceroyis in favour, is the setting up of such publicity machinery under the immediatecontrol of the Agent-General as will enable him to carry out adequately what are naturally and peculiarly his own responsibilities in that sphere. The second isthat the Ministry of Information should consider, in consultation with Mr. HaroldButler, whether measures may be necessary to enable the British InformationService to function with the maximum effectiveness in the direction I have indicated. I am taking up this aspect of the matter with the Minister forInformation.L. S. A.India Office,August 13, 1942.
