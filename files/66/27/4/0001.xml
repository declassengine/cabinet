naval SITUATION.General Review.1. A German U-boat has been sunk in the Atlantic; otherwise there havebeen no outstanding events at sea during the week.Shipping losses reported have been lighter than of late. An Atlantic convoyhas been repeatedly attacked, and U-boats have been active off Trinidad andFreetown.Home Waters.2. During the night of the 25th/26th four S.G.B.&apos;s off the Normandycoast attacked&apos;two anti-aircraft trawlers, one of which was left sinking andthe other damaged. Early on the 28th, off Cherbourg, H.M. Destroyers Calpeand Cottesmore engaged two enemy trawlers, one of which was sunk and theother seriously damaged : the destroyers were unsuccessfully attacked by aircraft while returning to port. There were two casualties in Cottesmore.On the night of the 28th/29th three M.G.B.&apos;s and three M.T.B.&apos;s, on an offensivepatrol off the mouth of the Scheldt damaged at least one E-boat and laterengaged three larger ships, one of which was torpedoed and left sinking;another was set on fire. Two M.G.B.&apos;s and one M.T.B. were damaged. Onthe morning of the 29th, off Dover, two minesweeping trawlers were attacked by aircraft, one of which was shot down by H.M. Trawler A ndradite.Northern Waters.3. Eleven ships in the outward-bound convoy to Russia have arrived at archangel. The one ship unaccounted for is now presumed to have been lostas a German broadcast stated that one officer from this ship had been recscued by a German Red Cross aircraft. Casualties in personnel in this convoy are estimated to have been about 70 and there are 1,150 survivors.Up to the present 18 convoys have been sailed to Russia, consisting of 230ships of which 39 have been lost.Mediterranean.4. On the 12th H.M. Submarine P211, while on patrol on the east coast of Sardinia, sank the Italian s.s. Adda (800 tons) laden with timber, andthree days later attacked a 1,500-ton ship which was probably beached. TheGreek Submarine Nereus reported having sunk three caiques in Dodecanesewaters, and claimed a probable hit on a 7,000-ton ship.In addition to a number of ships attacked in enemy ports on the Libyancoast, over 18,000 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or damaged by our aircraft.Naval aircraft, working in co-operation with the R.A.F., have continued to bomb enemy tanks and motor transport in the battle area and enemy aircraft onadvanced landing grounds. Naval Swordfish have been employed nightly on anti-U-boat patrol duties off the Libyan coast. On the 25th naval fighters shot down two Italian aircraft off Port Said.In the past 18 months naval aircraft operating from Malta have accountedfor some 200,000 tons of enemy shipping sunk or damaged by night torpedoattacks, principally on the route from Italy to Tripoli (L).During the week 21,609 tons of French shipping eastbound and 14,887 tonswestbound have passed through the Straits of Gibraltar under escort. -East Indies.5. On the 28th the Dutch Submarine 0.23 made an unsuccessful attack on two Japanese 8&quot; cruisers and four destroyers in the Malacca Straits proceeding to the northward.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. H.M. Canadian Destroyer St. Croisc, escorting an outward bound convoy,sank a U-boat 500 miles east of Newfoundland. On the 23rd two Canadianminesweepers carried out a promising attack in mid-Atlantie.   H.M. Destroyer
Wanderer may have damaged a U-boat off New York. There have been 11 other attacks by surface craft: three by our convoy escorts and eight by Canadian andU.S.A. warships.U-boats continue to be hunted by aircraft in Home Waters and off theAmerican and Australian coasts. Twenty-nine attacks have been carried out, and,although there has been no definite evidence of destruction, hits were claimed in four attacks.Enemy Intelligence.German.7. There is no change in the dispositions of main units. At Kiel, on the28th, Prinz Eugen was seen in dry dock and the Scharnhorst and Nurembergalongside. Prinz Eugen should be ready for trials by the end of August, andScharnhorst may be ready in the near future.Raider A ctivity.8. The U.S.A. tanker William F. Humphrey (7,982 tons) was reportedsunk by a raider about 850 miles east of Ascension on the 16th. The sighting ofa suspicious vessel indicates that another raider may be operating offPernambuco.It is estimated that four enemy supply ships are at present at sea.Italian.9. The traffic from Italy to North Africa has increased during the past week. There are indications that the enemy is using Benghazi in preference to more easterly ports.U-boats.10. There is no appreciable change in the number and disposition of u-boats operating in the Atlantic. Japanese U-boats have been operating offNoumea and in the Bay of Bengal.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ending 26th/27th July, 1,002 ships, including 259Allied and 15 neutral, have been convoyed. Of these, 266 ships were in oceanconvoys and 736 in British coastal convoys. Three anti-aircraft ships,63 destroyers (including three U.S.A. destroyers) and 93 sloops, cutters and corvettes were employed on escort duty.During the past week 105 ships in four ocean convoys arrived in home waters without loss.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the week ending25th July totalled 722,500 tons compared with 362,500 tons during the previous seven days and an average of 635,000 tons for the past ten weeks.  Of the week&apos;s -imports 278,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.12. Seventeen ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boats duringthe week; of these, nine are known to have been sunk. Five ships were torpedoedin repeated attacks on an outward bound convoy to Canada. Seven ships were attacked in the Caribbean and West Atlantic, three off Freetown, one in the bay of Bengal and one in the Pacific off Noumea. One ship was sunk, presumablyby mine, off Suez and aircraft have attacked shipping off the Faroes.Focke W.ulf aircraft unsuccessfully attacked a ship off Iceland (C), and haveshadowed a homeward bound convoy from Gibraltar.British Minelaying.13.   Aircraft laid mines off the Dutch coast and in the Bay of Biscay.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.14. On two nights of the week enemy aircraft may have laid mines off theEast Coast, and, on one night, minelaying by aircraft was suspected off Falmouth[24155] b
and Milford Haven. No minelaying by E-boats has been reported. Elevenmagnetic, one acoustic and two moored mines - have been destroyed during,the week.The mine totals are : 2,512 magnetic, 1,316 acoustic and 1,446 moored.None of the mines reported off Alexandria have so- far been destroyed inspite of continuous sweeping.Traffic in the Suez Canal is unrestricted except through the southern section,which ships are only allowed to enter in daylight hours after a sweep has beencarried out past the two danger points.Enemy Merchant Shipping.15. The Italian s.s. Africana (5,869 tons) has been loading ore for the first time at Bilbao, and was ready for sea on the 27th. The German s.s. Wuchtfels(8,467 tons) was seen in Benghazi on the 24th.The Italian tankers Albaro (2,104 tons) and Celeno (3,741 tons) are expectedto leave Constanza for the iEgean in the near future.MILITARY SITUATION.Egypt.16. It is now apparent that our &quot;-attacks in the central sector on the 21stand 22nd July, although severely shaking the enemy and causing him heavy losses, proved on the whole to have been disappointing, and on the 23rd we were forced to withdraw slightly from the advanced positions we had won in the northand centre; the western ends of the Tel el Eisa and Ruweisat Ridges againproving untenable in the face of enemy counter-attacks. Elsewhere positions were maintained and consolidated.The- short lull of three days which succeeded this operation was spent by theenemy in still further strengthening his defences and troops were digging in andminelaying along the whole front.On the night of the 26th-27th July we made a limited thrust in the northernsector and although the infantry again made some progress through the enemy&apos;sminefields they were counter-attacked by tanks and were forced to retire to their former positions.   Since then there has been no change in the tactical situation.The Russo-German Campaign.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this .Res%ime.)Voronezh Sector.17. The Russians have held the initiative, and have been attacking bothagainst the German flank running north-westwards from Voronezh, west of the don, and against the one bridgehead remaining to the Germans east of the Donat Voronezh itself. Substantially the Germans, who have been entirely on the defensive, retain their positions, though the Russians may have penetrated theirlines at some points.The Russian attacks may now have died down.Middle Don Sector.18. From the area south-east of Boguchar the Germans have thrust dueeastward, and claim to have reached the elbow of the Don opposite Stalingrad.The Russians, however, are putting up a stiff resistance at this point, and theGerman claim is not yet fully substantiated.Lower Don Sector.19. In their advance southward and south-eastward from the areaMillerovo-Voroshilovgrad, the Germans have reached the Don from Tsimlyan-skaya westward to Rostov. At Tsimlyanskaya itself and east of Rostov theyhave established two main bridgeheads which they are now extending. Rostov,which lies on the northern side of the Don, and Bataisk, to the south of the river,have fallen to the Germans.
Caucasia.20. German bombing of Black Sea ports has decreased, but other indica-tions suggest that a German combined operation against the Taman Peninsula isstill likely.Summary.21. The German offensive has now been in progress for a month and, in itsswing south-eastwards, has made progress at an average of 12 to 13 miles a day-a rate only slightly slower than the fastest advances of last year. The germans have made no claims to large numbers of prisoners and the Russians themselvesstate that their withdrawal has been orderly. This withdrawal may have beeneastwards towards Stalingrad, for the rapidity of the German advance and, inparticular, the speed with which they crossed the Lower Don, suggest that theRussians have been unable to withdraw any large forces to the south of the river and that their powers of resistance have thereby been seriously weakened. TheGermans now appear to be thrusting in three directions-eastward against theMiddle Don, with Stalingrad, an important tank manufacturing centre, asthe probable objective; south-eastward over the Don at Tsimlyanskaya against therailway Stalingrad-Tikoretsk; and south-westward over the Don near Rostov,towards the line Armavir-Maikop-Tuapse. At Maikop is the smallest andnearest of the Caucasian oilfields, with an annual output of some 2,500,000 tons.Far East.China.22. In North China no further information has been received regarding the resumption of Japanese pressure to the north-east of Kalgan, and this activitynow appears to have been little more than local bandit suppression work.In Central China there are indications of limited withdrawals of japanese troops from central areas. These withdrawals have enabled the Chinese toimprove their position, and they may now be in possession of at least two townson the Chekiang-Kiangsi Railway. The Japanese are still in occupation ofWenchow on the coast, and it appears that the Chinese claim to have recapturedthe port on the 17th July was premature.In South China no further Japanese advance has been reported from theCanton area.   The Salween front in West Yunnan has remained quiet..South-West Pacific Area.23. During the night of the 21st/22nd July the Japanese effected a landing in the Gona-Buna area on the north coast of New Guinea. There are, as yet, noreliable indications as to the numbers of enemy troops involved. Acting withtheir customary speed, the Japanese quickly pushed inland, and on the 23rd july well-trained enemy patrol was encountered at Awara (approximately 33 miles west-south-west of Buna on the track between Buna and Kokoda).The object of this landing is not yet apparent. It is possible that theJapanese wish to mount a land attack against Port Moresby, in which case Bunawould seem a logical base.Intelligence.France and Low Countries. .24. Reciprocal movements between Russia and the west continue. It isstill too early to assess the exact extent of these movements during July, but itis believed that an approximate balance has been maintained, and that, where possible, an attempt has been made to offset the steady decline in quality of thoseformations left in the west (due to the calls made upon them for drafts to thefront) by the transfer of tired field-army divisions from Russia. These, althoughbadly in need of rest and refit, are no doubt intended to raise the average fightingvalue of the troops in vulnerable areas.Turkey.25. In view of the increased German threat in the Black Sea resulting fromthe conquest of Sevastopol, the Turkish General Staff have recently taken stepsto reinforce their northern coast.  The forces in this area have been strengthened[24155] b 2
by from three to four divisions, and Corps Headquarters have been set up atZonguldak, Samsun and Trabzon. This has been achieved partly by an increasein the total strength of the Turkish forces, and partly by the transfer of troops from Thrace, where, in our opinion, too much of the Turkish Army wasstationed.M anchuria.26. All evidence tends, to show that Japanese -military preparations in manchuria have reached an advanced stage, and it is considered that, if Japanintends to attack Russia, her preparations are complete and operations can be started at any time.AIR SITUATION.General.27.   Our bombers made five heavy attacks on targets in Germany.Enemy night attacks against this country were on an increased scale.&apos; Our aircraft in Egypt continued to provide effective support for our ground forces.Enemy shipping in the Mediterranean was successfully attacked.United Kingdom.28.   Fighter Command flew 1,008 defensive sorties by day and 625 by night.Daylight activity by enemy long-range bombers was slight and the onlyunusual feature was an early morning raid on the 27th July, when some 25aircraft made a very scattered attack on this country in the course of whichbombs fell in at least 18 counties. Single engined. fighters, in pairs or singly,carried ou,t small offensive operations over the south coast on most days. Eightenemy aircraft were shot down in daylight during the week.At night enemy activity was on an increased scale. On two nightsBirmingham was the chief target, although bombs were dropped over a wide areaof the Midlands. A total of 60 and 100 long-range bombers respectivelyparticipated in these attacks. -On three other nights small-scale raids were carried out, one of which concentrated in the Middlesbrough area. Twenty-two enemy aircraft were destroyed (including five by A.A. fire), nine probably destroyed and thirteen damaged.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.29. Fighter and Bomber Commands despatched 655 and 66 sorties respectively, compared with 624 and 136 last week.Mosquitos and Wellingtons operated ^against targets in North-West Germanyand the Ruhr, and a number of objectives were attacked, mostly by individualaircraft, with no outstanding results reported.In Holland, two Bostons successfully attacked a chemical works at Sluiskil,and it is probable that both the ammonia and sulphuric acid plants were severely damaged.Our fighters operating over Belgium and. Northern France continued toharass enemy communications, and numerous attacks were made on barges, loco-motives, goods trains and railway centres. A Ju. 88 was destroyed on the groundat Lannion aerodrome, and three Me. 109s were damaged on an aerodrome nearMarquise.Sweeps over Northern France encountered very few enemy aircraft except on one day when about 11 squadrons of Spitfires operating over the Pas de Calaisdestroyed nine F.W. 190s, probably destroyed three and damaged ten for the lossof three of our aircraft.In addition to the casualties already mentioned, our losses in the week&apos;operations were three bombers and 15 fighters.Night.30. Bomber Command aircraft made five heavy attacks on Duisburg(twice), Hamburg (twice) and saarbrucken.
In the two attacks on Duisburg, a total of about 725 tons of H.E. (including127x4,000 lbs.) and 265 tons of incendiaries was dropped. On both occasionsvisibility was moderate but gaps in the cloud enabled the target to be identified..Several large fires were seen in the old town and the dock area, and a Mosquitooperating in the neighbourhood on the day following the second attack reporteddrifting smoke and four large fires still burning.The first attack on Hamburg was carried out in perfect weather and isconsidered to have been extremely successful, concentrated fires being bothnumerous and large, particularly in the old town and in areas around the Alsterlake and the docks. The second attack was not so fortunate in that a rapiddeterioration in the weather caused a number of aircraft to be recalled, and. theremainder encountered dense cloud along the whole route and severe icingconditions. The few aircraft that were able to identify the target reportedseveral good fires, and one very large explosion at Harburg. About 800 tons ofH.E. and incendiaries were dropped in the two operations.saarbrucken, which has not hitherto been subjected to a large-scale raid,was attacked in fairly good visibility by 243 aircraft which dropped 338 tonsof H.E. (including 103 4,000-lbs.) and 214 tons of incendiaries. Many firesboth large and small, were seen north and south of the river with a particularlygood concentration in the centre of the town. The steel works to the West of thetown appeared to be well alight, and several aircraft reported that a gas containerwas hit and exploded.From the above attacks a total of 84 bombers are missing, and a furthereight bombers were lost out of a total of 95 despatched to attack aerodromes.About 140 aircraft of Fighter Command, of which four are missing, were despatched on &quot; Intruder &quot; operations. Bombs were dropped at four railway centres, and 25 locomotives and about the same number of goods trains were attacked.   Three enemy aircraft were destroyed and four were damaged.Coastal Operations.31. Coastal Command flew 679 sorties, of which 58 were on convoy escort.Shipping protection patrols by Fighter Command involved 1,043 sorties.A night attack by Hudsons and Hampdens on a convoy off the Frisian islandsresulted in hits on two vessels of 4,000 and 2,500 tons respectively. Anothervessel of 2,500 tons was also probably damaged.Hurricane bombers made four night attacks on shipping off the French coast.One 2,000-ton vessel was hit and is believed to have sunk later. Another merchant vessel, one small naval vessel, two R-boats and two coasters were damaged.By day, an E-boat was destroyed off Gravelines by Spitfires, and a merchant vessel was severely damaged by a Sunder land off San Sebastian.Enemy shipping and weather reconnaissances off our coasts were maintained at normal level, and interceptions by our fighters resulted in the destruction of seven enemy aircraft for the loss of two Spitfires, from which one pilot was saved.In addition a Sunderland destroyed a Me. 109 off the Spanish coast, andanother Me. 109 which attempted to attack a Beaufighter off the Frisian islandsdived into the sea.Bomber Command aircraft laid 74 mines in enemy waters.Mediterranean.Egypt and Libya.32. Our air operations continued on a heavy scale, but during the latter part of the week they were somewhat reduced owing to the static conditions of theground operations and the wide dispersal of targets. In the week ending the27th July, 2,686 sorties were flown by our aircraft, compared with 3,373 in theprevious week.Light bombers and fighter bombers operated actively in the battle area and carried out a number of destructive raids on enemy M.T., gun emplacements, tanktransport vehicles and other military targets. Close support was also providedfor our ground forces. During one engagement, when fighter bombers responded to a call for assistance from our infantry and attacked banks and gun emplace-ments, our ground troops reported on the effectiveness and the accuracy of the bombing.   .
El Daba landing ground was attacked by day and by night. On the 24th july strong force carried out two surprise raids, which resulted in 21 enemy aircraftbeing destroyed or damaged on the ground, two others crashed while taking off,and three were shot down by Kittyhawks before releasing their bombs; four ofour aircraft are missing.At night heavy attacks by Wellingtons, Halifaxes and U.S.A. Fortresseswere carried out on harbour installations and shipping at Tobruk. Hits weremade on the main jetty and some very large fires were reported in the harbourarea. Twelve U.S.A. Liberators also effectively bombed Benghazi harbour atdusk. During these attacks seven ships received direct hits, four of which caughtfire, and numerous near misses w7ere made on other vessels.Night attacks were made on mechanical transport in the battle area by wellingtons and naval Albacores, the Albacores also co-operating to good effect by dropping flares over the target area. Many fires were reported including a&apos;number of petrol fires. Blenheims effectively bombed tank workshops at mersa matruh and at Galal (west, of El Daba).Enemy aircraft were used extensively on the 23rd July against ourmechanical transport and tank concentrations in the battle area, and fourJu. 87s were shot down by Hurricanes. During the remainder of the1 week there was little ground activity and as a consequence enemy operations were on a much reduced scale and largely confined to reconnaissance. Threereconnaissance Ju. 88s were shot down in the Alexandria area and two others were probably destroyed.It is estimated that about 35 Ju. 52s with twin-engine fighter escort were used daily to carry personnel, supplies and equipment from Crete to north africa while He. Ills continued to transport fuel to Egypt.Crete.33. Two attacks were ma.de on the aerodromes in Crete. In one of these29 Wellingtons bombed Heraklion, where bombs fell on the runways and dispersalareas causing six fires.   One enemy aircraft crashed taking off.Heavy bombers carried out a dusk attack on shipping in Suda Bay andhits w-ere claimed on ships and wrecks.Malta.34. Enemy operations against Malta were fairly consistent. Two or threecimes a day small formations up to nine Ju. 88s, escorted by .15 to 20 fighters,or fighter formations attacked or approached the island. Luqa was the principaltarget, but on a number of occasions the raiders were intercepted off the coast and dispersed or forced to jettison their bombs. Three of our aircraft were destroyed on the ground and others were damaged.Our fighters were very successful and shot down 28 aircraft, probably destroyed 11 others, and damaged a further 27, for the loss of two Spitfires.Sea Communications.35. Beauforts from Malta, escorted by Beaufighters, attacked a vessel of ,000 tons with a heavy deck cargo, off Cephalonia Island. The ship was hit witha torpedo and was reported down by her bows with fire spreading. A torpedohit was also made on a vessel of 5,000 tons escorted by destroyers south of Zante;the destroyers were attacked with cannon fire and with bombs. Five Beaufortsare missing from these operations, but the crew of one is safe.Four Wellingtons from Egypt attacked a convoy of two vessels escorted by two destroyers 130 miles W.N.W. of Tobruk. A hit with a torpedo was obtained on one vessel and a destroyer was probably hit. Another ship east of Bombawas hit and reported to be stationary. .. .Burma.36. Three Blenheims attacked the railway between Pyabwe and Mandalay,scoring hits on engine sheds, trucks and the permanent way.Single U.S.A. bombers attacked railway bridges north of Katha and thetrack at Mogaung. Other small-scale attacks were made by the R.A.F. onKalewa, Akyab, Singaung, Homalin and Mindbya (near Akyab). At Homalin,two buildings were destroyed, and a large building at Mindbya wTas damaged.Supplies were dropped by U.S.A. and R.A.F. aircraft at various places inthe Shingbwiyang area, and for the Chin levies in the Chin Hills.
Pacific Zone.37. A total of 23 attacks were made by R.A.A.F. and U.S.A. aircraft on targets in the Buna/Gona area. A 5,000-ton vessel was set on fire, a smallammunition dump was destroyed, and. several buildings were damaged. Incombats with enemy aircraft, one enemy fighter was destroyed and two were probably destroyed.   Two U.S.A. bombers are missing.Three attacks were made by a total of 18 Hudsons on Koepang aerodrome(Timor), and small-scale raids by U.S.A. bombers were directed against SohanaIsland, and the aerodrome and shipping at Buka (Solomon Islands).An attack by 18 enemy bombers and 18 fighters on the twelve MilesAerodrome at Port Moresby resulted in the destruction of some bombs and petrol.Enemy aircraft also bombed Nanzap (on the Markham River, New Guinea).Australia.38. Three attacks involving a total of twelve aircraft were made on Darwin,causing slight damage. About six enemy flying boats ineffectively droppedbombs in the Townsville area.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.39. On the 25th July a single aeroplane caused damage at Bedford, andlate the next day 12 persons were killed at Withernsea. On the 25th there werecasualties near Start Point.Early on the 27th widespread and scattered bombing occurred in the Eastand South and South-West of England, and in the Midlands. Bombs were dropped, in particular, on the Rolls Royce Works, Derby; Crittalls Works,Witham; Short Brothers, Swindon, and the Royal Ordnance Factory, Hereford.Over 60 people were killed in this raid.On the 29th damage and casualties were caused at Great Yarmouth.By Night.40. On the night 23rd/24th there was scattered bombing in the eastern counties and the East Midlands. Damage was caused at Nottingham, King&apos;sLynn and Great Yarmouth. On the 25th/26th there was bombing in theNorth-East of England. Considerable damage was done and 10 people were killed at Middlesbrough.On the night 27th/28th bombing occurred in all areas exept the North ofEngland, Wales and Scotland. The main concentration was on Birmingham,where incendiary bombs caused a number of fires. Seventeen factories were affected, but at only three of them was the damage serious. Outside Birminghamall incidents were of a comparatively minor nature.On the 28th/29th there was minor bombing in East Anglia and Lincolnshire.On the following night heavy bombing again occurred at Birmingham, withscattered incidents in the Midlands and East Anglia. A large number of fires were again started in Birmingham by incendiaries, but the situation was under control early in the day. Elsewhere damage was done to Humber&apos;s factory,Coventry, and a fire started at Shell Mex, Purfleet.Damage.41. Damage of national importance has occurred during the period to anumber of factories. Those more seriously affected are : Royal Ordnance Factory,Hereford; Rolls Royce, Derby; Crittall Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Witham;Mulliners, Ltd., Jones and Rooke, Ltd., W. and T. A very, Ltd., Birmingham.Casualties.42. Estimated civilian casualties for the week ending Q600 hours the29th July are 185 killed and 287 seriously injured, of which 65 were killed and139 seriously injured at Birmingham.

The above table is an aggregation of the material in the employment tables of non-tankers and tankers in Statistical Digests E and F respectively. in combining the figures for non-tankers with those for tankers, certain slight differences have had to be brought into a common form. The figures for non-tankers relateto the last day of the month while those for tankers relate to the 15th of the month to February 1942 and to the last day of the month from March 1942.(1) (a) Tankers on Admiralty service include vessels importing oil fuel to the United Kingdom; in June 1942 these comprised 21 tankers of 1.79,000 gross tons.(b) Non-tankers allocated to the fighting services which are under.repair are excluded from this column.   All tankers on Admiralty service are, however, included.(c) A substantial part (in recent months nearly one-half) of the tonnage in these columns brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage (see note (3)).(2) These columns give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair. They do not,therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward voyages to the Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries other than United Kingdom and Eire.
