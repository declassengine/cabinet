The order covered15 dumb barges of about 7,000 tons dow0  for carrying light oil coast-iwise.      This order has recently been increased to one for 50 oil-carrying bargeso42, orders were placed for 24 self-propelledibed as &quot;ship-form&quot; barges.      These are eachtons oowo iur  uhe Carribean sugar trade,,      Weather conditions in this trade would not normally approximate to those under which ocean-goinivessels would be required to operate,,have(tonsIn June 1942been descrido wo for theIn June, 1942, orders were also placed for 26 dumb barges eachlof 6,475 tons d0w0  for the carriage of bauxite0The steel reinforcement in these American built barges is heavy,amounting to some 50%;    it appears, therefore, that there is no greatsaving in steel over steel ships of equivalent carrying capacity0    the type of concrete used is stated to be lighter than the average.It is stated that there is, however, definite economy in shipyardlabour, which is understood to be the chief attraction of concretebuilding for the American authorities.      If additional labour wereivailable in 1J.L   the Admiralty consider that it could be used more:eonomically to dilute the labour force of existing shipyards engagedm construction of the usual type.      It is also to be^noted that steelxLates used in steel ship construction are a bottleneck in U.S.A.      Inthe U.K. , on the other hand, ship plates are as easy to get as steelftf the type required in concrete construction.No deliveries of any of the American barges have yet been made,Ind all barges of the original order are much behind contract dateindeed up to the 1st July only three keels   had been laid.      ThisidTierican experience of concrete construction confirms our own.      Thearitime Commission have been warned that, according to the experiencef the Ministry of War Transport in Egypt, concrete barges are likely0 be disintegrated by bombs falling near.A. V.
