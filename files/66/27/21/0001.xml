this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s goyernment       j ljPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1942.- :       29MOST SECRET. Copy No/W.P. (42) 341.August 6, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may he taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.POSSIBLE EVACUATION OF ALEXANDRIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 20th July the War Cabinet, with the concurrence of the Chiefs ofStaff, decided (W.M. 92 (42), Minute 4) that it would be undesirable to proceedwith a proposal, elaborated by the Egyptian and British authorities, for the&quot; thinning out,&quot; at the expense of His Majesty&apos;s Government, of the civilian population of Alexandria; and for the preparation of a more thorough schemeof civilian evacuation to be carried out, at the joint expense of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Egyptian Government, should need arise.2. It appears from a subsequent telegram from the Minister of State(Annex 1) that in view of developments the Middle East War&apos; Council had decided, before the receipt of the Cabinet&apos;s decision, that the &quot; thinning out &quot;scheme should be postponed. But the Council remain convinced that it isessential to work out plans as quickly as possible for the mass evacuation of thecity which, in their view, will be inevitable in the event of heavy air attack orimminent land attack, and they recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould offer to bear 50 per cent, of the cost of such evacuation which, theyestimate, should not exceed  1 million. Mr. Casey emphasises that all that isrequired at this stage is His Majesty&apos;s Governments authority to work out theplan. Fresh authority would be sought before it was implemented and themoney spent.3. The foregoing proposal has been considered by the Chiefs of Staff who-agreed on the 31st July (C.O.S. (42) 361) that, provided the necessary preparations were based on the danger of heavy air attack, there would be no objection to the formulation of plans for the evacuation of civilians on the lines proposed.4. I should accordingly be grateful for the War Cabinet&apos;s approval of the annexed draft telegram to Mr. Casey (Annex 2), on receipt of which my Depart-ment will simultaneously approach the Treasury on the financial aspects of thequestion.A. E.Foreign Office, August 6, 1942.11818   [24199]
ANNEX 1.Minister of State to Foreign Office. (Received July 25.)(No. 1120.   Secret,)(Telegraphic.) . Cairo, July 24, 1942.Reference Cairo telegram No. 1833.Scope of Anglo-Egyptian plan for the evacuation of Alexandria.War Council considered these proposals yesterday and are unanimously agreed that plans and preparation for the mass evacuation of native civilians in Alexandria should be completed as quickly as possible. In the view of theCouncil, under heavy air attack or imminent land threat, mass evacuation willbe inevitable.  The more that can be done to organise it in advance the better.The War Council therefore support the - proposal outlined in paragraph 1of Ambassadors telegram, and recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government should offer to bear half the cost of the scheme. Total cost cannot be estimated, but itis thought reasonable contribution from His Majesty&apos;s Government on a 50-50basis should not exceed  1,000,000.2. With regard to thinning out referred to in paragraph 2 et seq of the ambassadors telegram War Council agree that if this could be done beforehandlater mass evacuation scheme would be much simplified. On the other handpublic morale is improving, the scheme would be voluntary, and War Counciltherefore feel that few are likely to take advantage of it. Moreover to draw attention to the scheme in endeavour to make the people understand might have unfortunate results on public morale. War Council therefore decided that thispart of the proposal should not be put into operation for the present.3. Since the above was drafted your telegram No. 1871 to the Ambassadorhas been received. We remain strongly of the opinion that it is essential towork out a plan on lines indicated in paragraph 1 above in order to avoidrisk of a stampede by the civilian population of Alexandria such as took placelast year, which would in any case be an embarrassment and might in certaincircumstances be disastrous from a military point of view.It is emphasised that all that is asked at this stage is that you agree tothe working out of a plan. We would seek your authority again before theplan was implemented and the money spent.(Copies sent to Mr. Armstrong.)ANNEX 2.Draft Telegram to Minister of State (Cairo).(Secret.) 1942.YOUR telegram No. 1120 [of 24th July : Evacuation of Alexandria].His Majesty&apos;s Government agree that, prodded the necessary preparationsare based on the danger of heavy air attack, there is no objection to the formula-tion of plans for the evacuation of civilians on the lines proposed. You aretherefore authorised to proceed accordingly.2. We are in consultation with Treasury on financial aspect, and further telegram on this point will follow.3. Experience in this country has shown that mass evacuation is impossibleto maintain for any length of time, except as regards areas which have been almost totally destroyed. In other areas, if people have homes to go back to, theyalways return.
