THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July, 1942.MOST SECRET. Copy No.CCS. (42) 357.July 29, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.Chiefs of Staff Committee.MIDDLE EAST-REVIEW OF SITUATION.Report.WE have examined the situation which may arise in the Middle East inthe event of Germany obtaining a major success against Russia, and have prepared a draft reply* to telegram No. CC/&apos;79t of the 9th July to Middle east defence Committee.Assumptions.2. We have had to make certain assumptions in order to calculate theforces which may be available in the Middle East at various dates. these assumptions are : (a) That General Auchinleck is able to allot to Iraq-Persia the 51st and56th infantry divisions, which he will receive from the UnitedKingdom, and the armoured division coming from the United States.(b) That the 5th Division is sent from India to Iraq and an option is held to follow it up with the 2nd Division.Threat to North Persia.3. We realise that the Russian Southern front may break this year. Ifit does and if we have taken no steps to deal with such a situation, there is little to prevent the enemy from advancing through Persia and reaching the SouthPersian oilfields.Winter Climate of north-west Persia.4. The Persian winter will limit and at times impede a German advance,but it will not prevent either land or air operations. Since our lack of armoured forces make it essential to stop the Germans before they reach the Iraq plain,we must oppose them in north Persia, where the country is less suitable forarmoured formations. * .&apos;&apos;* Annex I. -f- Annex III.
2Transfer of Forces from Egypt to the Northern Front.5. It would be unwise to count on General Auchinleck being able to transferland forces from Egypt to Iraq and Persia to meet a threat arising this autumnor winter. Such a transfer will be most difficult until Rommel had been defeatedand driven out of TripolitaniaSecurity of Persia in Autumn and Winter 1942-43.6. Reasonable security on the Persian front may be attained this autumn and winter provided (a) That it is possible to make the 51st, 56th and 5th British infantry divisions and the additional armoured division from the United Statesavailable for operations in that area, with an option to send the2nd British Infantry Division from India to Iraq.(&amp;) That a sufficient part of these forces are able to concentrate in Persiain time.The requisite air forces should be available provided that delivery of american aircraft and arrival of United States Air Corps units proceed according to plan and provided also that intensive operations in the Western Desert are notprolonged indefinitely.Air Defence Persian Gulf.7. Persian Gulf ports may come under air attack by October. We arearranging for the completion of the anti-aircraft defences approved for theBasra-Abadan-Bahrein area, subject only to the immediate needs of the NileDelta.Importance of Persian oilfields and refineries.8. At Annex II we attach a short note on the oil position. We wish todraw the attention of the Defence Committee to paragraph 19 (o) of the draft telegram, which stresses the importance we attach to the security of the Persianoilfields.In making the decision to defend Abadan even, if need be, at the expenseof Egypt, the following factors have been taken into account: (a) The main purpose of our whole Middle East effort is to defend the sources of oil and its sea transport.(b) If we lost Persia and Iraq, our position in Egypt would ultimatelybecome untenable for military as well as economic reasons.(c) Conversely, even were we forced to abandon Egypt, this should notnecessarily involve the loss of Abadan.Security in Spring 1943.9.   If Russia is defeated and Turkey is acquiescent, the Axis might bring a very heavy attack from the north and west against the Middle East position vin the Spring of 1943, which we would have difficulty in meeting.The situation would, however, be transformed if Rommel were decisivelybeaten and driven out of Tripolitania or if &quot; Bolero&apos;&apos; shipping were allotted tocarry additional reinforcements.Capacity of Persian Gulf Ports.10. The limited clearance of Persian Gulf ports, for personnel and stores )after disembarkation, will seriously influence any reinforcement programme.Any reinforcements moving along the Persian Lines of Communication willcompete with &apos;&apos; Aid to Russia &apos;&apos;; and owing to the long transit time between.United States or United Kingdom and the Persian Gulf, it is impossible to forecast at the time of despatch which will be the more important when they reach port.In August, September and possibly October it is expected that existing commitments (which include stocking of bases) will cause congestion at persian gulf ports.   Although some increase in clearance capacity is expected from
October onwards, it is broadly true to say that none of the reinforcements contem-plated in the draft telegram after the 56th and 5th Divisions, whether from india, United States or United Kingdom, can be disembarked at Persian Gulfports without causing a reduction in the onward flow of &quot; Aid to Russia.&quot;Supplies destined for Russia in the form of guns, aircraft, ammunition or military equipment as opposed to raw materials can, of course, always be used by our own forces should congestion of the Lines of Communication prevent itsonward passage to Russia.11. The situation in Persian Gulf ports may become aggravated as a resultof air attack and air mining.The Time Factor.12.   Finally, we would stress the time factor :  (a) To meet the threat to Abadan which may arise this Autumn, the 2ndDivision may have to be moved from India to Iraq as soon after the5th Division as transportation facilities will allow.Orders have been issued for the move of the 5th Division.(b) If Tripolitania is in Axis hands we shall have great difficulty in meetingsuccessfully a full-scale attack against the Middle East in April 1943,unless a part of the &apos;&apos; Bolero &apos;&apos; shipping is diverted at an early date to carry further British or American reinforcements.Unless we are to take grave risks, this diversion of shipping willhave to start in August.Proviso to acceptance of General Marshall &apos;s Plan.13. We wish to draw the attention of the Defence Committee to the factthat when accepting in principle, in April 1942, General marshals plan for continental operations, it was made clear that the security of the Middle Eastshould not thereby be endangered.RECOMMENDATION.14.   We ask the Defence Committee to Approve the despatch of the telegram at Annex I to the middle east Defence Committee, repeated to Commander-in-Chief, India.(Signed) A. F. BROOKE.DUDLEY POUND.C. PORTAL.Great George Street, S.W. 1,July 29, 1942.
ANNEX I.Following from Chiefs of Staff for Commanders-in-Chief : Your CC/79 of 9th July.1.   We have fully considered your telegram and our appreciation is asfollowsi SECTION I. AUTUMN AND WINTER 1952.Threat to Northern Front.2. (a) Assuming immediate capture of Rostov, complete break in SouthernRussian front and everything in Germany&apos;s favour, German forcesof 3-5 divisions, supported by 200/300 aircraft, might be ready to advance from Tabriz-Astara during first half of October.We think that advanced elements only could penetrate south aboutthe 1st October, but unless firmly opposed advance might be rapiduntil snow came in December. Thereafter German operations wouldbe slower, but would not necessarily cease.First requisite on the Northern Front is therefore to oppose firmlyinfiltration by limited enemy forces.Light scale unescorted air attack might develop on Basra-Abadanarea from mid-October.Must stress above is worst case possible.(b) German move through Turkey considered unlikely while Germansengaged against Russia. Turks also unlikely to acquiesce in german demands unless our position in Middle East had gravely deterioratedor they had lost faith in ultimate Allied victory, and the Germans hadbuilt up an adequate force to coerce them. Consider attack againstvour Northern Front through Anatolia unlikelv bpfgrp snrincr(c) Seaborne airborne threat to Cyprus and Levant thought unlikely atpresent on large scale, since Germans will concentrate on reinforcingLibya to gain decisive issue there.Threat to Western Front.3. We calculate that, so long as enemy can use all ports in Cyrenaica, he cansooner or later build up to 15 divisions.If he loses Cyrenaica and is forced to rely on Tripoli alone, he can maintainthe equivalent of six German divisions. In this case he may attempt to extortuse of French ports in Tunisia and, if successful, scale of threat might again be built up to 12 or even 15 such divisions, depending on our ability to interferewith sea communications. The threat is not likely, however, to reach thesedimensions until present German drive in Russia successfully concluded, andnot necessarily even then.4. The threat to Egypt from enemy air forces based on aerodromes in north Africa and Aegean Islands is likely to remain at some 400-500 Germanoperational aircraft backed by 300-400 Italian operational aircraft.Ability to Meet Above Threats.A rmy.5. (a) Egypt. We believe that you have reasonable chance of inflictingdefeat on Rommel in near future.If you halt or are held on Libyan-Egyptian Frontier you maybe unable to reduce forces in 8th Army since potential enemy threatremains the same. Similarly, if you reach Agheila-Marada line,withdrawals from 8th Army might still be inadvisable.If, however, you could clear Rommel out of Tripoli, not oniywould French attitude towards Axis tend to stiffen, but your positionwould be enormously strengthened by your increased control of sea communications.   In these circumstances you might be able to make
considerable withdrawals of land forces from your western flank to your Northern Front, although your air requirements in Cyrenaicaand Tripolitania would remain large,(b) Persia-^Iraq Front-You have stated your total requirements for persia and Iraq as two armoured and seven infantry divisions (paragraph 7of CC/79 of 9th July and Appendix D of Middle East J.P.;94).In addition to 51st Division, you will.get 56th division from united Kingdom and 5th Division, possibly followed by the 2nd Divi-sion from India, all of which should reach you before end of November.The additional armoured division :from the United States willprobably, not be operational until early January.On assumptions that (i) These are all allotted, to Northern Front,(ii) You have not succeeded in driving Rommel out of Tripolitania andso can spare nothing from your Libyan front, and(iii) Troops now in Iraq and Persia are equivalent to one division and one armoured brigade (paragraph 8 of telegram CC/79),these reinforcements will bring your strength in Iraq and Persia to five infantry divisions and one armoured brigade in November and five infantry divisions and one and a half armoured divisions in January. l&quot;our shortage in Novemberwill be one and a half armoured and two infantry divisions and in Januaryone armoured brigade and two infantry divisions.In view of unlikelihood of threat through Turkey, we think you may beprepared to regard this force as sufficient to hold German infiltration into north persia this autumn and winter. Your admitted shortage of armoured divisions on.this flank up to January will be partially offset by difficulty of operatingarmoured forces in North Persia in winter.Your comments are urgently invited.Air Forces.6. Present plans envisage expansion of air forces to 75 squadrons by the30th September and 88 squadrons by the 31st December. These figures include,at British squadron equivalents, 13 United States squadrons by the30th September and 24 by the 31st December. Thus, by the 31st December, you should have most of your full estimated requirement of 95 squadrons for thewhole theatre, including Malta, Aden and East Africa. Intermediate build-up should be adequate to meet any reasonably probable threat in the. meantime.Moreover, we hope to increase substantially the flow of tropicalised Spitfiresduring next three months.7. The transfer of 20 squadrons from Middle East to South Russia is beingconsidered here if Rommel is decisively defeated. Object.would be to meetGerman attack as far north as possible. This transfer, which, in any case, wouldnot be before, end-of September, has formed subject of separate telegram.Defence of Abadan.8. We have-given, high priority to provision of material and equipment for defence Abadan area.SECTION II. SPRING 1953.Enemy Threats.9. - Assuming complete defeat of Russia and German decision to drive usout of Middle East, scale of enemy threat becomes : (a) Northern Front Through Turkey If Germany decided to attempt to move through Turkey, she would first have to build up in the Balkans and iEgean area^duringthe winter to coerce. Turks -with..a view to starting to.move, throughTurkey in-early, spring 1943. Assuming Turkey&apos;s acquiescence, the build-up on Syrian-Iraq&apos; frontier would be. gradual from advancedelements in mid-April rising to some&apos; 10 divisions maximum by mid-June.
Into Persia 5 divisions (assuming- 1 division by Caspian Sea).Any increase would require major improvements to communicationsonly possible after winter.(b) Western Front Up to 15 divisions.Thus total land threat 20 divisions by April, rising to 30 by June, behindwhich there would be ample reserve for wastage. Figures could not be increasedunless enemy obtained use of Egyptian or Levant ports, or had received majorreconstruction of Persian communications.(c) Air By April 1943 the Axis air forces in the Eastern Mediterraneanare unlikely to be substantially higher than those mentioned in para-graph 4 above, i.e., some 400 to 500 German and some 300 to 400Italian aircraft.These are the maximum forces which could be operated andserviced efficiently when deployed directly against Egypt. Theywould, however, have more depth than those at present in theEastern Mediterranean as, in addition, some 400-500 G.A.F. aircraft could be based in the Central Mediterranean area and used to relieveunits as required.The threat against Persia and Iraq would amount to some300-400 G.A.F. aircraft.If the enemy also advanced through Turkey, it is considered that,owing to difficulties of maintenance and supply, he would find thenecessary air forces from those already in the Eastern Mediterranean,rather than bring in additional squadrons for the purpose.(d) Seaborne :Attack on Cyprus or- Levant seaboard will not become likelyunless Axis gains local air superiority.Ability to meet threat, assuming reinforcements as in Section I have arrived andGyrenaica in enemy hands.Land Forces.10.   You state your requirements in Middle East J.P. 94 Appendix D, as : Persia and Iraq : 2 armoured, and 7 infantry divisions.Syria ; 2 armoured and 6 infantry divisions.Cyprus : 1^ divisions.Internal Security in Egypt: 1^ divisions.Western Front: Latest estimate we have of your requirement for western Front is 3 armoured and 4 infantry divisions, as stated inparagraph 25 of Middle East J.P. 101.On above basis, therefore, you estimate your total requirement at 7 armouredand 20 infantry divisions.11. We anticipate, however, that, against scale of attack which enemymight develop in Spring, 1943, if Russia had been defeated and enemydetermined to drive us from Middle East, you will need forces of the order of four armoured and six infantry divisions on your Western Front and a G.H.Q.reserve of one armoured and two infantry divisions.On this basis your total requirement would be nine armoured and 24 infantry divisions.12.   Towards this total we reckon that you will have : A armoured Divisions. 1st, 7th, 8th, 10th, 31st Indian and one Americanarmoured division.Armoured Brigades. 9th and 22nd.Army Tank Brigades. 1st.
Infantry Divisions. 2nd, 5th, 44th, 50th, 51st and 56th British; 1stSouth African; 9th Australian; 2nd New Zealand; 4th, 5th, 6th,8th and 10th Indian; 1st Polish and about six miscellaneousbrigades.Grand Total. Six armoured divisions, two armoured brigades, one army-tank brigade and seventeen infantry divisions.13.   Please note : I      (a) We have excluded fresh Polish divisions as their arrival is veryspeculative.(b) We have, however, included 9th Australian Division on retention ofwhich in Middle East we intend to take firm stand.14.   Deficiency from our estimate is therefore 1\ armoured, divisions and^7 infantry divisions.15.   We would like to have your considered comments on above figures.Possible Methods of Making Good Deficiency.16.   Land Forces (a) If major part of movement of United States troops to United kingdom were cancelled now, we might on present calculations find shipping for four divisions to reach Middle East by the 1st April in additionto anything sent in normal W.S. shipping. We are intending todiscuss this with Americans and a complete review of shipping situation of United Nations is in hand which may show this position could be improved.(&amp;) Further transfers, in addition to 2nd and 5th Divisions from India,may be possible during 1943 but you should, not rely on any of thesereaching you by the spring.17.   Air. Reinforcements. Provided you do not suffer undue or heavywastage, strength of your air forces will be as shown in paragraph 6 above.18. Naval Forces. Reinforcements required to bring naval forces up to thestrength required in Appendix C of Middle East J.P. Paper No. 94, except forfleet destroyers and submarines, should, be provided by end of year. circumstances may, however, force us to defer this programme. Our ability to defeat seaborneattack will be dependent on excluding the enemy from the Delta and Turkey.CONCLUSION.19.   The answer to-paragraph 13 of your telegram is therefore : (a) The capture of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania is best contribution to middle east security, since it is doubtful if total requirements can otherwise be met, even at expense of trans-Atlantic movement of american forces; you should therefore strain every effort towards defeatingRommel and exploiting your success to the limits of Italian Africa.(b) A spreading of Middle East base installations by judicious thinning out from Egypt may well be advisable, and this is for you to judge; muchwill depend on whether you are able to defeat Rommel. Should the worst arise, i.e., if we were unable to send you adequate forces andthe Russian southern front broke, you must hold on to the &quot;Abadanarea in the last resort even at the risk of losing the Egyptian Delta.At present, however, we do not consider that circumstances in anyway justify a large-scale withdrawal of forces and installations from egypt, involving abandonment of that country.20. We realise that whole Middle East position mainly depends onsuccess against Rommel or continued resistance of Russia. Neither can represent-judged. We shall therefore constantly keep whole position under review,including possibility of helping you by operations elsewhere; and send, you inthe meantime 51st and 56th Infantry Divisions and one other armoured division from United. States and 5th Division, possibly followed by the 2ndDivision, from India.
ANNEX 11.Middle East Oil Position.1. The Oil Control Board have recently shown* that, on the assumptionthat we lost Abadan and Bahrein, we should have to draw from the Gulf ofMexico, N.W.I. and California a further 13.416.000 tons of oil per annum.2. They further pointed out that, although the necessary supplies could bemade available from the Gulf, N.W.I. and California, there would be difficulties over the supply of 100 Octane Aviation Spirit and of Admiralty fuel oil of the required specification.3. By far the most serious aspect of this loss would be the additional require-ment of tankers. If the amount of oil in paragraph 1 had to be shipped from theGulf, N.W.I. and California, we should require to find 270 tankers additional to the existing Allied tanker fleets.4. The cuts required to free this amount of tanker tonnage are impracticableand the Oil Control Board conclude that the loss of Abadan and BahreinC( would be calamitous inasmuch as it would enforce a drastic reduction in our total war capacity, and probably the abandonment of some of our present fields of action.&quot;* G.O.S. (42).352 of 21/7.
ANNEX III.(Unparaphrased version of a Secret Cypher Message not One Time Table.)From Mideast to A ir Ministry.(No. CC/79. 9/7.)Following for Defence Committee from Middle East Defence Committee.1 As you are aware, ever since Japan came into the war, and majordiversions of land and air forces were made from this theatre to the east, we havebeen running grave risks on our northern front. We have, in fact, been relyingentirely on Russia to guard this approach to our bases in Egypt and thePersian Gulf.2. We are now faced with a situation which may briefly be summarised asfollows : (a) Almost the whole of our land and air forces are concentrated in the west.(&amp;) The German offensive in Russia has begun, and it seems that the enemyis achieving at least an initial success. In the worst case for us we might have to meet a threat to Northern Persia by the 15th October,or, if the enemy changes his plan and comes through Anatolia, we might have to be ready in Northern Syria and Iraq by 10th September.As the enemy seem committed to a Russian campaign, the threat to northern Persia is the more likely.(c) To meet these threats to our northern front we have in Persia, Iraq and syria portions of only two Infantry Divisions, some partially equippedAllied contingents, and no Air Forces of any consequence. In presentcircumstances, and for some weeks to come, unless we are preparedto accept the loss of the Delta, it is quite impracticable to disengageland and air forces from the battle and transfer them to the Northernfront. Even if we did, the number of formations and squadrons wecould find would be quite inadequate to meet the threat that may develop. Moreover, we should have to start transferring forces onthe 15th July if we are to be certain of their arriving in time to meetthe worst case.3. It is of course impossible to say how the Western Desert battle may develop. It may end in stalemate, in which case we shall have to wait until wehave built up sufficient strength to take the initiative. The enemy would be free to do the same, and it might therefore be a long time before we could resume the offensive. During this time the threat to our Northern front might wellmaterialise and there would be little we could afford to release to keep it.4. On the other hand, the battle may develop in our favour and we mayhave the choice of (a) Exploiting our success to the utmost in order to secure Cyrenaica.(b) Making a limited advance in order to gain time to build up forces forthe Northern front.5. We here are all agreed, and we assume you will agree, that, if the battledevelops in our favour, we must attempt to exploit it to the utmost and go all out to regain Cyrenaica. But we must make it clear that in this event also, apartfrom such air forces as we may be able to form and locate on the Northern frontbetween now and the beginning of September, there will be little left over to meetan attack through the Levant or Persia. We do not discount the offer of threePolish Divisions which we hope will be concentrated in this Command, and equipped by you, at the earliest possible moment. These divisions will be a valuable asset but they are unlikely to be equipped and trained in time to meetthe first German onslaught on our Northern front.6. Our present policy is to secure the Delta from the West. To secure theNorthern front as well, substantial reinforcements, both land and air, over and above those already assigned to this theatre, are necessary.
7. Situation Land Forces. We require in Persia two Armoured and fourInfantry Divisions and in Iraq three Infantry Divisions, or a total of twoArmoured and seven Infantry Divisions.8. Against this we have in Iraq and Persia one partially equippedArmoured Brigade Group and portions of two Infantry Divisions roughly equalto one Infantry Division. We cannot count on anything from the Western Desertor Syria except possibly 10th Armoured Division, which is being re-equipped inthe Delta and should be available by end of September if not required for the battle.9. Of reinforcements already advised, 8th Armoured Division is assigned to the Western Desert. Unless the situation continues critical, it may be possibleto employ 44th and 51st Divisions in Persia. Three Polish Divisions offered by soviet Government may be available after first onslaught, but arrangements arenot yet firm enough to count these as assets.10.   Total land deficiencies for Iraq and Persia thus are (a) If the situation in the Desert continues critical, one Armoured division and six Infantry Divisions.(6) If the situation in the Desert allows of our using 44th and 51st divisions in Persia, one Armoured Division and four Infantry Divisions.In either case this will mean that there will be available for Syria only one(the existing) Polish Division and any formations that can be spared from eighth army-.   There will be no G.H.Q. reserve.11. Situation Air Forces. In order to secure the Northern front, strengthof .air forces in this Command must be brought up to our estimated minimumrequirement of 95 squadrons by the 1st September and the flowT of aircraft must beincreased accordingly.12. We must point out, however, that development of the Persian Base andL. of C. will shortly be virtually at a standstill owing to the increased scale of aid to Russia. If, therefore, we are to be ready to receive and maintain in Persiathe necessary forces for the defence of the oilfields, aid to Russia will have to bescaled down immediately to allow of the necessary development and stocking.13. In our view the issues before us are extremely grave. . If the campaign in Russia goes badly for the Russians and you find it impossible to send usnecessary reinforcements in time, wre shall be faced with a situation in which itwill be necessary to decide (a) Whether our forces and as much of our Base installations as possible should be deliberately transferred from Egypt to the Northern front tosecure the Persian oilfield with the consequental loss of Egypt, or(b) Whether we should continue our present policy and risk the loss of thePersian oilfield.We have not got the forces to do both, and if we try to do both we may fail to achieve either.   We request your guidance and instructions on this issue.(T.O.O. Q937Z/9.)
