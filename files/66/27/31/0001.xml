COPY.My telegram No.  232.FOLLOWING FOR HIGH COMMISSIONER.Ross, Australian Government representative and british consul Portuguese Timor,  recently made his way to /australia.His report, v/hich is summarised below and which we desire atpresent to be treated as- most secret, is most heartening fromthe point of view of future offensives against Japanese-occupied islands north of Australia.Summary of report begins\?nen Japanese landed on 19th February No.  2 IndependentCompany A,I,Fv were&quot;disposed among mountains to west of Dilli,v/here they could better employ offensive guerilla tactics whereinthey had been specially trained,Japanese landed force of marines and soldiers 4,000 strongsA Dutch unit of abour 600 troops, mostly natives,  retreated tothe mountains from the ( town) without defending it and graduallydisintegrated.    Australians, with ample ammunition and food supplies in the interior of the island, began,   guerilla warfareagainst the enemy.    Their ambushes and raids were so successfuJ.that Japanese columns found they could not move into the bushwithout risk of serious losses.    In period March to JuneJapanese lost a minimum of (? two hundred) and fifty killed whileone Australian was wounded.    Enemy therefore now practicallyconfined to Dilli, leaving whole area between Dille and RivadeseXLacoast in hands of our patrols.Through Ross, Japanese twice asked Australians to surrender?but as our force was practically intact, had proved its super-priority to the Japanese on each occasion when (contact) was made,and was well supplied with anmunition and food, surrender was not considered.Our troops meantime established communication, includingradio, with Australia.    Supplies specially dropped by aircraft and carried across Timor Sea by boat.Before Japanese arrived, Australian troops made (friends of the) natives.    Nothing was obtained from them without payment?they were not ill treated in any respect and to their greatestwonder were (^treated) as human beings and their salutationsacknowledged and returned.    Word spread about the island that the australians,were good men and they were accordingly .given a welcome everywhere.Telegram received ( in cypher) from External Affairs Depte,Canberra, by External Affairs Office, London0S.L.470 -7th august;   19420

Existence of Australian force as a :?:&quot;.ghting unit whenno food supplies could be obtain from aimy sources and whenall money had been spen: would have been impossible withouthelp       all Portuguese officers in- interior and friendship and admiration of natives,Older Portuguese officials are not wholly in sympathy with Salazar regime,,    The few young officials are Fascists.But bulk of Portuguese population consisting of politicaldeportees and retired officials were friendly almost withoutexceptionBut wherever Japanese went they stole everything of value and destroyed remainder-,-.    They never paid for food obtainedfrom the natives5 molested their women whenever possible and generally behaved like animals;.After it was seen how Japanese treated both Portugueseproperty and nctives themselves ( neither) Portuguese officials in the interior nor natives could do enough for an AustraliansoldieroFor three months natives together with Portuguese officialprovided our troops with free food ( ?transport) and personalservice and kept our men informed of every Japanese movementaway from Dilli0Consequently morale of our troops is high and so longas occasional mails and supplies can be received from australia the Force Is contentoWith heavy reinforcements the Japanese could eventuallyclear out this Force but only at the cost of very severecasualties^EVATT.EXTERNALo
