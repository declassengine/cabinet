A a? )HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT, )sjjj C R B -T.^143) gg,g. COPY NO.memorandum by the Chancellor, of the, Eychequerolo     President Roosevelt has recently set out the principle underlying &quot;Reciprocal Aid&quot;? namely   that each of the united nations should contribute ail it can from its own resources tothe common war effort and that none of -the United Nations shouldend up the war with a monetary war- debt to any of its partners0The Canadian fift of 1 billion dollars and our own lease-lendarrangements with Russ:ta:i China and our other Allies rest onthe same principle..,2o      The financial arrangements bet-ween the UCK* and india at present in force are totally Inconsistent with this -principle,We make no money charge for the aeroplanes^ munitions andequipment which we send to india    India recovers from us in sterling a large proportion of the expenditure included in herDefence Budgets(This covers expenditure incurred as our agent aswell as expenditure in which it is arguable that India has aconsiderable or even a predominant interest)0    The estimatedamount which India expects to recover from us in 194-2/45 is some 260 millions c or about &amp;j% of the expenditure to be met from theDefence Budgetc    (in the 1942/43 Budget? as originally presented,,the proportion was &apos;30fo) n3o      The War Financial Settlement of April 1940 providesthat India recovers from us all her defence expenditure excepther normal pre-war budget (adjusted for rises in prices), measures taken in India for India1 s local defence-, and a share of measures&quot;taken jointly in the interests of Indian Defence and of H0M, Ge&quot;The underlying assumption that the War is not India1 s affairexcept so far as the local defence of India is concerned^ may-have been a tenable point of view in 1939 and 1940r,    It is nolonger so in 1942-fco     The result of this arrangement (in conjunction with india&apos;&quot;&apos; s favourable balance of visible trade- ) has been that wehave paid India very large sums0    HithertopIndia has been ableto use these payments to extinguish her indebtedness to us inrespect of pre-war sterling loanso    These loans have, now, been entirely repatriated,, except for Railway Debt to the amount ofsome  50 millions^    From now onwards India is likely to increase her sterling balances., or? in other words, we are likely tobecome heavily indebted to india    By April 1943 India1s sterling balances may amount to between  400 and  450 millions (of which some  250 millions represent backing for the note issue)0

50     The arrangement of April, 1940,, was not accepted &quot;by theChancellor of the Exchequer as necessarily final0    The whole position has been completely changed &quot;by the Japanese entry intothe war and the resulting threat to India, and by the adoptionof the principle of Reciprocal Aide    I feel &quot;bound to submit to my colleagues that the existing arrangement should now heradically revised,Ga      The acquisition of very large sterling balances by india would give rise to grave problemsP both financial andpoliticals    Our greatest economic difficulty after the war willbe to preserve equilibrium in our balance of payments with therest of tiie world - i... e*  to pay for the imports noeeded tomaintain a tolerable standard of living for our people0    Wecannot afford to start with a handicap of debt amounting to several hundred millions of pounds.    It would be intolerable thatthis should be our reward for successfully defending India from being overrun by Japan or G-ermany07o      India would certainly demand that these balancesshould be converted, wholly or -partly., into gold or dollars0This would be impossible and political friction would result:we should be told that a rich country had repudiated a debt toa very poor country     There would be no satisfactory methodof dealing with very largo balances after the war0    It isessential that &quot;they should not be allowed to accumulate080      The right principle to apply is that of reciprocal aid--*-that we should supply without charge   whatever costs sterling,arid    tbjELt    India   should supply without charge whatever costsrupees,    We should not abandon that principle, even if it cannotbe fully implemented at the present timeQ90     As an immediate steps  it should be recognised? evenif v/e accept the view that India is primarily concerned withthe defence of India, that this conception needs to be interpreted in a reasonably wide spirito    We plan to send toIndia this year aeroplanes costing over  100 millions,,    The valueof these (so far as they are not lease-lent) should be set-offagainst the stores which India supplies to us for use in LibyaetCo    Again,, the reconquest of Burma and the defence of persia and Iraq should be regarded as an integral part of the defenceof Indiae    It is an untenable proposition that India should cease to regard troops as employed on her defence the momentthey cross the frontier..    In particular? India should bear thecost of all&quot;rupee expenditure incurred to aid China, for to aidChina is to attack Japan and thus to defend Indiao10o     I have stated our point of view to Sir Jeremy Raisman,the Finance Member, who has come to this country on a short visit to discuss this question,,    He is, as I gladly recognise, anxiousto give any help he can within the limits of the existing-iinaiicial arrangement    But the help which he can give within theselimits is very little (not more than  40 millions non-recurrent and 7-g- millions recurrent) and does not advance us towards a solutionof the problem^    lie maintains that the existing War financial settlement cannot be altered,,   Any alteration would? he contends^be viewed by Congress and even moderate public opinion withintense and bitter suspicion, and would raise counter-demandsthat we should pay in dollars or gold-,- instead of in sterlingoIndia cannot;^ he says, be coerced into a war effort free of charge, and sterling is, therefore, bound to accumulate so longas India remains in the war0

11,,      I think the   War Cabinet will find it impossible toaccept the argument that? because lar-ge-^secfcions of opinion inIndia, arc critical^ we should have, not only to bear the burden.,^---of defending India? but also to pay an enormous monetarytribute to India for the cost of her defence0    Undoubtedly weshall be criticised if we insist that the principle of reciprocal Aid should be applied or- that the concept of thedefence of India should bo given a reasonably wide interpretation,But v/e cannot hope to escape   criticism with India in her presentmood., and to criticism of the kind suggested by Sir JeremyRaisman wo have an answer convincing to our ow;  public opinion and to that of the United States,,    If ? however, we leave thepresent arrangements unaltered and are left after the war witha debt which v/e cannot pay in gold or dollars, and which gravely?and unjustly,   adds to our own post-war difficulties, we shallhave far graver criticism to meet from India and no convincingreply, whether to India? to America? or to the people of thiscountry by whose efforts the war will have been won,120      On the financial side Sir Jeremy Raisman has argued that a Defence Budget of some  ISO millions represents the   -utmost that India can finance,, by taxation and borrowing -the pre-war revenue of the total Central Budget of India havingbeen only some- 64 millions,?    In reply to this I have pointedout that the rupees spent in India have to be found by taxationor borrowing in Indian whether- or not a part of this rupeeexpenditure is covered by sterling payments*    India is undoubtedly a poor country and the difficulty oif internalfinancing is very realo    But in this difficulty we cannot helpcTo pay sterling to India enriches India and impoverishes us.after the warP but during the war it does not help India inthe least degree0130      I do not desire to under-estimate the financial or political difficulties with which the Government of India arefacedo    But the existing War Financial Settlement does notdiminish their present financial difficulties and only avoidspolitical difficulties today at the cost of involving graverpolitical difficulties hereafter.    My conclusion is that theSettlement must now be revised so that in future India1scontribution will be increased to a level which is fair and reasonable on the facts of the case and which will prevent the accumulation of dangerously large sterling balances0KoWoTreasury Chambers03Qth Julj-^ 1942o
