THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1942.Copy No.WAR CABINET. 50 MILLION LOAN TO CHINA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andChancellor of the Exchequer.ALTHOUGH we have carefully reviewed the loan negotiations with China in the light of Sir H. Seymour&apos;s telegram No. 1094 of the 3rd August (annexedhereto), we regret that we are unable to propose any action by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment which would resolve the present unfortunate disagreement with theChinese Government.   The facts are as follows : 2. In December 1941 General Chiang Kai-shek asked the United StatesGovernment and His Majesty&apos;s Government for large dollar and sterling loans.So far as we were concerned, it was explained to him that in present circum-stances China could not make much use of foreign exchange. He replied thatthis did not matter; he wanted to create an effect on the population and the armies. He admitted that what he wanted was a picture on the wall which hecould display to his people, and he did not much care whether he could use itor not.3. After consultation with the United States Government, we informedGeneral Chiang in February 1942 that, in addition to a lend-lease arrangement for munitions, we offered to lend China an amount not to exceed in all  50 million at such times and for such war purposes and upon such terms as might be agreedupon between the two Governments. A public announcement to this effect wasmade in the press on the 3rd February.4. We later informed the Chinese Government that we interpreted war purposes as meaning expenditure in the sterling area for war needs, but that we did not exclude a guarantee for an internal loan up to  10 million if it was desired.5. On the 21st March the United States Government announced the grantof an unrestricted loan of $500 million, whereupon the Chinese Minister ofFinance urged us to issue the British loan on the same unrestricted terms. Wewere unable to comply with this request for the reasons explained in the following paragraph, and, in particular, we have refused to accept any commitment forthe post-war period beyond the  10 million guarantee for an internal loan.6. The principal reason why we cannot afford to make large sums availableto China after the war, whether in cash or in the form of a credit for the purchaseof British goods, is that we shall then have acute difficulty in maintainingequilibrium in our balance of payments. During the war we have obtained, andare obtaining, essential imports (a) by realising our capital assets abroad, and(b) under lend-lease from the United States (and out of the help given to us by canada). After the war we shall have to face the very difficult task of payingout of our current exports for our imports from the rest of the world, and wecannot afford to give to China a first call on these exports.  50 million is a verylarge sum in this context. It would be impossible to defend having let China &quot; inon the ground floor&quot; to this extent, in priority to our own Dominions and colonies, especially as China will, for a time, be in a better position than weshall, thanks to the very large loan unconditionally granted to her by the UnitedStates.7. This has been fully explained to the Chinese Government. They agreethat the use of the loan should be confined to the sterling area, and they professto accept its limitation to the period of the war, but nevertheless they persist in11830   [24251]SECRET.W.P.

2putting forward proposals which would in effect nullify these restrictions. Theyask in particular that the whole or the greater part of the credit should be madeavailable as reserve backing for the Chinese currency. This request has also hadto be refused. It has been explained to the Chinese Government that during thewar, while China can obtain supplies on credit (she enjoys lend-lease facilities forwar materials from ourselves as well as from the United States Government), hercurrency does not need additional foreign exchange reserves, and that this pro-posal would, in effect, result in the accumulation of sterling credits for use afterthe war. This, for the reasons already given, we cannot permit. It has alsobeen impressed on the Chinese authorities that the accommodation for whichthey are now asking has not been accorded even to the Dominions or to our owncolonies.8. The position reached at present is in the nature of a stalemate. We onour side have been unable to devise any formula which, while safeguarding ourown financial position, would give China any real benefit, The Chinese, althoughunwilling to sign the agreement on our terms, have not specifically rejected the credit, and, in fact, they would appear to have allocated a part of it as security for an internal loan. On the other hand, we have made it plain that the credit isstill available and may even be drawn upon for approved purposes prior to the signature of a formal agreement.9. It would seem from the annexed telegram that this issue has become amatter of personal prestige with Dr. Kung, who appears to have led GeneralChiang Kai-shek to believe that he could force His Majesty&apos;s Government to concede terms not less favourable than those granted by the United StatesGovernment. It is reasonable to suppose that this is an important factor in theattitude of the Chinese Government. From the political point of view, theposition is that we have stood firm on our refusal to be manoeuvred into makinga concession which we believe to be of no benefit to China and seriously detri-mental to ourselves. Much as this disagreement is to be deplored, our feeling isthat any concession at this stage would be regarded by the Chinese as weaknessand, indeed, that our firmness has probably gained us some respect. We believethat by giving way now we should derive no lasting advantage perhaps,indeed, disadvantage in return for lasting financial burdens.A. E.August 21, 1942. K. W.ANNEX.Sir H. Seymour to Mr. Eden. (Received August 4.)^To. 1094.)(Telegraphic.) Chungking, August 3, 1942.MY telegram No. 1087.Currie&apos;s views on the British position here are exaggerated. They could not[ ? omitted : but] be influenced by those of Kung, whose role, while important, isnot so preponderating as he would have distinguished visitors believe. Kunghas thought all along he would be able to force us to concede terms not less favour-able than those granted by the Americans, and he has apparently told chiang kai-shek -shek he was confident of success. His failure so far has caused loss of faceand resentment, but that resentment is not shared by many influential Chinese,who show better appreciation of our contribution to the common war effort.2. Nevertheless, Chiang Kai-shek will be guided by Kung in this question,which would be liable to create serious trouble. It may therefore be desirableto have some compromise in reserve. Would you consider a solution by whichthe balance of credit unexpended at the end of the war would be made available by equal annual instalments over a period for the purchase of United kingdom goods (such as railway rolling-stock and electrical and other machinery) ? the shorter the period the more palatable it would be to the Chinese. I have discussed the implications of this concession with my advisers and realise its disadvan-tages, but our position is so weak in the absence of full American support that i suggest it is worth while considering.3. If concession is to be made (see my telegram No. 566, paragraph 7. thirdsentence), I would suggest it tentatively as from myself and say that, if accept-able, I would be prepared to recommend it for your consideration.
