THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 369.August 21, 1942. \JWAR CABINET.INDIA.Proposal to Grant Powers of Punishment over British service personnel to Indian Commissioned Officers.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.WHEN the War Cabinet on the 27th July discussed my memorandum ofthe 22nd July (W.P. (42) 307) on the powers of punishment of IndianCommissioned Officers over British Service Personnel they invited me, inconsultation with the Secretaries of State for War and Air, to submit a further memorandum indicating how far the problem was one of immediate practical importance.(i) I have sought from the Government of India an answer to (i) and (ii)of the Cabinet Conclusion 7 of the 27th July, 1942, W.M. 96 (42). As regardsthe Army I am informed that the number of King&apos;s Commissioned indian officers (Indians commissioned from Sandhurst who hold the same type of commission as British officers and have similar powers of command andpunishment over British personnel) is approximately 200t and that the numberof Indian Commissioned Officers (Indians who hold a&quot;commission given by theGovernor-General in the name of the King) serving in units which includeBritish as well as Indian personnel amounts at present to about 800. how many Indian Commissioned Officers are, or are likely in the near future to be,in positions in which they would, if they held King&apos;s Commissions, exercisepowers of punishment it is not possible to say and to give even an estimateof numbers would involve a reference all over India and to Ceylon and theMiddle East. It is not merely a matter of estimating the total number whoare likely to attain command a;: command only involves powers of punishmentover British Service personnel when it is command over units containing mixedIndian and British personnel. There are 590 such units and even if reference were made to all of them the result would not be of much value as the likelihood of Indian Commissioned Officers attaining command often depends on the chances of battle and other uncertain factors.As regards the Air Force the Secretary of State for Air has ascertained from the A.O.C.-in-C. in India that there are some 420 officers of the IndianAir Force holding Indian Commissions of whom 324 are serving at stationswhere R.A.F. units are accommodated and 95 at stations where, though thereis no R.A.F. unit, there are some R.A.F. personnel.(ii) The practical importance of this matter lies, as stated in paragraph 3of my memorandum of the 22nd July, in the fact that Indian commissioned officers fitted by seniority and efficiency to command certain mixed units arebeing passed over for command because they are unable to exercise powers of punishment over British Service personnel. It is not the number of such cases that matters so much as the fact that they occur at all. Even a few cases arebruited about through the Indian Army and in circles in India on whose loyaltywe rely, and inevitably have a most deplorable effect. I feel that the greatestweight should be given to the judgment of the Viceroy and General Waveilon this matter.T24247]
2(iii) So far as the Army is concerned all that is needed to give effect tomy submission is to expunge certain words from King&apos;s Regulations. this does not require legislation. The Secretary of State for Air informs me thatin the case of the Air Force fresh legislation will be required, but that it will suffice if this is promoted in the Indian Legislature and takes the form of an act applying the Air Force Act to officers of a force raised in India. Nolegislation will therefore be necessary in this country.L. S. A.India Office, August 22, 1942.
