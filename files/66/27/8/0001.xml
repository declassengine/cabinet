THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY-OF HIS,- BRITArl-JICMajesty^ g^vernmew,3 E C RE. T  v. \trrpT?42)^8 -copy-no. a a -___1st August; 1942.VfAR CABINET.INDIAN STERLING BALANCES&apos;.Memorandum by the Secretary of state -for India.\1,     The Chancellor&apos; . of the Exchequer * s MemorandumVJ.P.( 42)325&quot;loads, him to the conclusion that the existing financial Settlement between India and this country must-be revised in such a way.as to be substantially-morefavourable to the United&quot;Kingdom.     I contend., in reply,first that. there-do&apos;not. exist equitable-, grounds for .sucha revision, and secondly, that the realities of theIndian situation in any case make revision impracticable.As my note-is. unavoidably. lengthy^ I have summarised themain points at .ffio end; (paragraprTrSl.2.     Thp Chancellor has.cited President Roosevelt insupport of. two propositions.     The first is&apos; that each nationshould contribute all It can from its own resources to thecommon war: effort..;&apos;:   On this I would say that the amount&apos;of contribution&apos;that can bo expected from.-, each nation must obviously, as President Roosevelt has clearly recognised inhis recent massage to.Congress about Lend-Lease, boproportioned &quot;to its! national income.     India is a poor&apos;country and I. endeavour to.show that.she is already, underthe existing-Settlement, bearing very large defenceexpenditurej and that, the existing financial arrangements between this country and India are by no means unduly-generous to India, even apart from the fact - which in thisconnection must never be overlooked - that India;, thoughtechnically:^one !of. the United Nations, is&quot; hot a: whole-heartedparticipant.in the war.in the same sense as, for example,Canada.       .     .&apos;        ... , -    - -3*&apos;   The second proposition-is that none of the united nations should end up the.war-with ,a monetary war debt toany of its partners,.    It is relevant to remember that thespokesmen: of Indian opinion.are already highly critical of the fact that in return for the-services and materialsthat are being supplied India is merely accumulating a formof assets, namely sterling-balancesj which is not that which -they would choose.     They.would reiect without questionany suggestion that India.-should dispense with even- the&apos;future prospect of converting those balances&apos; into assets ofa more acceptable kind, ..; Nevertheless the Government ofIndia arc-mindful of the need for doing anything that ispossible towards relieving&apos;the kind of-difficulties whichthe Chancellor forecasts,.   I shall indicate below that *they offer to assume considerable further burdens ofdefenco/
defence expenditure, are initiating proposals for the utilisation ofXst.erling accumulations to compound&apos;&quot;..... )...--.for future recurrent-sterling payments, and are anxiousto discuss the means of securing the orderly liquidation. ... .of any amounts outstanding.4.     The description in the chancellor&apos; s Memorandumof the present situation as one in which the UnitedKingdom has &quot;not only-to-bear the burden&quot; of defendingIndia but also to pay an enormous monetary tribute toIndia for.the cost of herdefence&quot; is a&apos; complete travesty.The figures of the recoverable war expenditure do not represent, in any sense a contribution towards relieving    :.India of part of the cost of the defence of.India;   they:represent such oart of the cost&apos;, of the general war -effort; .(in the, main supplying all the Imperial and Allied Forcesin Egypt, Middle-Cast, iraq and other neighbouring areas)as happens to be incurred on behalf of the.united KingdomGovernment.. and; to be payable.-in rupees.     Par the largestcomponent in the total consists, of: munitions and.other supplies, many of them having not -thevremotes:t connection .&apos;.with the defence of India -as: such, produced&quot;&quot;in&apos; India at&quot;the instance of the Ministry of Supply here;,   in fact9.goods ordered by the United Kingdom Government from commercial suppliers in India.,    the only&quot;reason:whythe payment therefor falls to.be made to the. Governmentof India is because, for the.convenience of the United     &apos;Kingdom Government, the Government of India have lentthe--use of their financial:and accounting facilities,:have become a-channel for orders and. supplies, and have on behalf of the United, Kingdom Government - paid the contractors.     Thus, any comparison between the amount- ofthe recoverable expenditure and&quot;the amount of India1 s.&apos;own defence budget can only be irrelevant and misleading.5*.    It is true that a change&apos; has come over &quot;the   , .situation by japan&apos;s entry into the war, and, by the approach of war to Indians own.frontier.     Those .eventshave, however, also brought about automatically thatIndia1s own defence expenditure has very greatly increased.Thus, whuroas according, to the Budget;Estimate this was.expected to amount in 1942/4.3 to Rs. 13,1 crorcs,- the .estimated&apos;rate of expenditure is now about.sRs. 245:crorcs per annum.     These are &apos; enormous-figures for. India.,and in the ; conditions of that, country /-whore ; the expectation generally realised in more highly developed&apos; --countries with a higher average level,of income, that .inoree.sod expenditure on .war account can readily begathered-;in again by taxation or &quot;borrowing, does.not hold good-,: - there is already doubt&apos;:whether a resultant    -inflationary condition can be avoided.  , The Indian noteissue is. already more than twice as high/as In August 1939,and by, the end. of 1942-43 is, likely to :be ;thrce times as  1high,.; &apos;lf. serious inflation occurs, It will mean a disastrous&quot;flight from currency into commodities, with consequential discontent and probably unrest.-1  The risk is/
is, however, being taken, and it is indeed probablethat under the existing Financial Settlement,   before1942-IT is out, India&apos;s own rate of war expenditure will have risen to considerably more than even this figure of Ks. 245 crores ( 184 million) per annum, andthat the amount next year&quot;&apos; will be even higher.6.     As the Memorandum tends to belittle India1s own defence efforts, and forecasts, for instance, thepossibility of the United Kingdom &quot;successfullydefending India from being&apos;over-run&quot;, I should perhaps in fairness add, what is often overlooked, that inaddition to serving as a producing and supply depot, onthe grand scale, India -has expanded her armed&apos; forces to .&apos;well over a million men and continues to expand them at the rate of over 50,000 a month.     Of these forces,over 300,000 arc serving overseas,, a figure whichprobably compares favourably with,-the overseas forcesof the rest of-.the Empire.     It: is these, services, andnot merely India1s pecuniary contribution (large thoughthat is in the circumstances of the country), thatrepresent Indians contribution to the general war effort.. ; . ...    /7.     One of the underlying contentions of the memorandum is that, irrespective of the merits in other respects,India must make a larger financial.contribution to defence because otherwise she may experience some difficulty in utilising the-proceeds of payments to hersave in ways inconvenient or embarrassing (after thewar) to the United Kingdom.- - - fthink that this has onlyto be stat-ed to be seen to be untenable&apos;.:     It is clearlybetter, especially from the standpoint of a poorcountry like India, that she should receive payment -even if the payment be deferred - than&apos;that sh6&quot; should carry the entire cost, (both In terms of money and of real things) herself.    -And it has already been made clear to the Treasury that the -Government of India arcprepared to meet the difficulties which the Chancel lor1sMomorandum foresees by the orderly liquidation of anyamounts outstanding:     for instance, by means of a development and reconstruction fund-, which would in fact be tantamount to guaranteeing to United kingdom manufacturers a long-term: market for capital&apos; goods.8,     The principle which the Chancellor holds should -be applied is that India should supply without chargewhatever costs rupees,&apos;&apos; I can see- no.-very obviousequity in * an arrangement which allocates the burdenof the.war not according to capacity to pay, or-.powerexercised, or benefits /expected,, but with,, relation,to-the more or le-ss;arbitrary and accidental circumstanceof, the origin&quot; of the, forces employed or the. sources&apos;- ofthe. materials expended.&apos;    The Chancellor goes on to admit that it may not &quot;be - possible to ^implement at thepresent&apos;time the-principle in -question.\ My case,is thatthe. circumstances of Tndiaa .are&apos; such-that there is no advantage in purporting ton ad opt.. a principle which . is notin fact capable of acceptance by.Indian opinion.9.   &apos; it- is a mistake ,to&apos; supposo that India&apos; .s&apos; f inaneia 1. - &apos; &apos; ^&apos;&quot;t&apos;  -.ow&apos;-,.-, -      &quot;.. -     .   &apos;     -part/
part in tho War has been confined solely to that which takes place on the soil of India.:    The conquest of east Africa and Ethiopia. r.nd the initial successes in -Libya, wore ,largely clue to the presence ef large forcesof Indian troops, trained at Indie.&apos; s expense, which were sent overseas-in the early stages of the war.     But I am *bound to point out that, so far from Indian opinion beinglikely to. accept, for -. example, the roconquest of Burma -unless it meant ihat Burma was again to be.subordinated- .to India. - as an appropriate object of Indian defence-expenditure, there is still in evidence much bitternessat the extent to which Indie was made to pay for thelest conquest of Burma.- .   .10.     A good deal of public&quot;attention in India is&apos;directed to these.questions of the Financial settlement end thegrowth of the sterling balances.     Within the last few daysI heve received a copy of a communication from the IndianChambers of Commerce, which refers to the Finance Member1svisit to -England, and says:    &quot;Trust no settlement willbe arrived at without consultation Indian Legislature and commercial opinion, and without giving full publicityall relevant particulars ........   Trust Government ofIndia will fully safeguard Indian financial interests :during pending negotiations and settlement with his majesty&apos;s Government, and see that only expenditurestrictly incurred for Indian defence is debited to indian revenues and the scope of India&apos;s financial-liabilities is not widened on ground Indians strategicfrontier extends to Middle East and other theatres pfwar&quot;      prom the latest telegraphed summary of theIndian Press I have noted also that all&quot; the principalnewspapers express in various ways the fear that india is being saddled with a huge expenditure out of all proportion to her responsibility and interests in the-&apos;war. without her consent and without her having anycontrol over the expenditure.11.     It would, however, be a serious mistake to suppose&apos;,as is assumed in tho Memorandum, that the argument -based-on the Indian attitude moans no: more than that &quot;large-sections of opinion in India arc critical&quot;.     Nor Is itrelevant to suggest that we can.reply to.Indian criticismsin a manner convincing to our own public opinion and to *-that of the United states,     I am convinced that, evenif tho present Finance Member and;the Viceroy woreprepared (and-I do.not think that they would be) torecommend to their colleagues in.tho Government.of india the acceptance of such a revision .of the Financial settlement as is being suggested, there is no hope that it;would beaccepted by the other Members of tho.Executive council who constitute the Government of India..    Nearly all&apos;these, it must be remembered, are.Indians, holding a leading position in the political life of the country,who have only recently consented.to. join the Council.The/
The result of attempting to impose such a revisionwould almost certainly be that they would resign, andthat it would be impossible to fill their places withother leading Indians,   -We should be driven.back to anattempt to&apos;govern the country without the co-operationof Indian public men. and the consequences, especiallyin the present situation of India, could hardly fail to be disastrous.12,     There is another aspect of the matter.     The whole body of Indian industrialists, financiers.-,and-- commercialmen are united in opposition to. the idea that India1sshare of the. financial burden of the war should be substantially increased.     Any attempt to force uponIndia an unfavourable revision of the financial settlement would jeopardize their co-operation-in themanufacture of munitions and other war supplies..    Evenif we were prepared to oust the&apos; industrialists and.&quot;take      ;over their plant, we have no-one to&apos; put in their place..At the best, there would be a calamitous reduction inIndia&apos;s practical participation in the war effort.I 13.     There is no Indication in the Memorandum thatI the Service Departments and the Ministry,of supply have&apos;-- been consulted..-and have concurred. . They: are vitallyinterested in the maxirnisat ion of India1 s material . !contribution to the waging of the war, and   doubt.-whether they would agree to - its . continuance-. beingendangered.- for purely financial reasons, .- and. moreoverfinancial reasons of a purely post-war character.     The- memorandum argues that it is only a post-war detrimentwhich India will suffer if she now forgoes payment in-sterling.     It is certainly the case that it is a purelypost-war financial detriment to the-United Kingdom;whichthe Chancellor&apos;s proposal seeks to avert.     Are.we as aGovernment prepared to -commit publicly, and - on-this rscale, the very crime which is rightly so much stigmatisedin the case, of firms and individuals, - that of sacrificingefficient prosecution of the war to-post-war considerations of profit and loss? &apos;. &quot;:.  -14,     I am not-maintaining that India should not beasked to make any concessions.     indeed, the Finance-..Member has already.Intimated that he hopes, though.with difficulty, to induce his - colleagues -in the Governmentof India to agree to make various additional concessions .which can,-by a little stretching, be brought within,the framework of the existing Financial Settlement^.;and.;whichwill have the effect -of-increasing India&apos; --contribution -in 1942-43 over and above- the rate of  184 million referredto iri--paragraph S above-by-approximately  47  million, ofwhich  71&apos;:million&apos; is: recurrent&apos;.&apos;    He feels-,-however, thathe could not conscientiouslyt -and certainly xould notsuccessfully, recommend to -his colleagues the; acceptanceof any of-these extensions- of the content of the Settlementunless it was quite clear that all suggestion that theSettlement/
Settlement itself ought to bo scrapped because ofthe rate of accumulation of- sterling, or that Indiaought to be expected to provide gratuitously such goodsor services payable in rupees as the United Nationsmay wish to acquire, had been definitely abandoned.15.     Admittedly, no such concessions which are withinthe bounds of practical politics would prevent the accumulation of large sterling resources on Indianaccount.     (I would here.remind my colleagues thatthese resources are not the property of the indian government..   . They are- lodged in the Reserve Bank,which has liabilities against them;   and they areonly disposable by the Government insofar as it canreplace thorn by rupee assets, i.o. usually by the proceeds of.rupee borrowings).    -The Government ofIndia arc prepared to do their utmost to cooperate-in the disposal of such sterling accumulations inmutually satisfactory ways.     In addition to further measures of debt repatriation the possibility is-beingexplored, for example, -of compounding for future .sterling pensionary liabilities by a lump sum payment *to the Treasury;   this might absorb an amount ofthe order of  100 million.16*     The Chancellors Memorandum assumes that thequestion involved is one for unilateral action by-the United -Kingdom.      . He asks the War Cabinet to approve a conclusion that the settlement &quot;must now be revised&quot;.     I am sure, however-, that the War Cabinetrealise that, whatever.the legal position, in fact the most that .could bo decided upon here would be to   \demand a bigger-contribution from India, not to secureit.    &quot;And I greatly fear that the only result of&quot; demandingit would be that we should have to choose between ,withdrawing the demand., which even so would undoubtedly have produced unpredictable and damaging results, !and maintaining-it, which, - it can be said, probably without   -exaggerationj - would for -practical purposes have theeffect of destroying-Ind^a&apos;s effective ^participation in the war..;&quot;&apos;, , -/...&apos; &apos;;- a%&apos;v:a17.     If, then, this -country presses a demand for a revision, and as a result.-there is an end to Indianco-operation with us in the government of the country,we snail, -for a purpose in which the world will find the motive of pecuniary-gain, have brought about thevery catastrophe which we are striving to:: prevent theCongress Party from precipitating^     a;dislocation ofthe vast and complicated machinery o-f &quot;-government in a great,country which as, and&apos;must remain, the.,heart of one of.the most vital theatres of war.     But-with a difference.For where then should we stand,in the estimation of the -U.S.A. and of such world opinion as still exists?  Wherewould the Government stand in; the&apos; estimation -of -our wn    ,people?       Meanwhile-,, so - far from actually-gettinganything over and above the goods and services at&apos;..   ...present furnished by India for the war, it is probablethat we should find&apos;, that oven these would have beendisastrously diminished.i\ Summary/
SUMMARY.18.   (i)     India is too poor a country to accept theprinciple that the cost of all goods and services provided from India or financed in rupees shall be finally borne by India.     But even now, under theSettlement, India.bears a heavy load of defence expenditure, - and increase is inevitable.   (paragraphs and 5).(ii) A large part of the sterling balancesaccrues through provision of goods and services not directly connected with the defence&apos;of India. (Paragraph(iii) The process of accumulation of sterling balances could only bo stopped either by ceasing todraw the goods and services or by ceasing to pay india for them.     Either course would mean a disastrouscollapse of India&apos;s participation in the war.(Paragraphs 11 and 12).(-iv)     Indian industrialists and business-men arc-so hostile to increase of India1s financial war burdenthat if a revision of the existing Settlement were to be forced on India they would probably cease to co-operate,and munition production would fall away.     (Paragraphs10 and 12).(v)       By the Treasury proposal the efficient use now of India-s war potential would be treated assecondary to purely post-war financial considerations.(vi) The Government of India offer to assume-further burdens within the framework of the existing financial Settlement, though they would find itimpossible on political and other grounds to scrap it.They arc anxious also to discuss the present or futureapplication of any mutually satisfactory methods ofmitigating any inconvenience to the United Kingdomthrough the accumulation of sterling balances.(Paragraphs 3, 7, 14 and 15).(vii) If the Treasury view were to be accepted bythe Cabinet any attempt to implement it would involvedeplorable political consequences, including the resignation of those Indian public men whom theViceroy has succeeded in adding to his Council in therecent expansions, and an Inability to find other suitable Indians to replace them.   (Paragraphs 11 and 17).L * S * A.INDIA OFFICE,1st August, 1942.
