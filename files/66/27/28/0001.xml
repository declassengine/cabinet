TO SEARCHLIGHT DUTIESMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. The increasing difficulties of securing man-power sufficient to maintain theArmy ceiling have made it imperative to try to effect the maximum possiblesubstitution of men by women in the Army. In A.D.G.B., in particular, everyeffort has been made to popularise and advertise service on the actual gun-sitesin mixed batteries by A.T.S. volunteers, and apart from that women have beensubstituted for men in a very large number of non-combatant duties.2. The present position, however, is that not only have the numbers ofwomen obtained fallen far short of the 250,000 whose services could profitably beused in the Army, but it has been found impossible to effect the desired degree ofsubstitution of men by women on the anti-aircraft guns and searchlights. In fact,a strength of some 60,000 women is required to undertake duties at presentclassified as operational (and therefore voluntary) in A.D.G.B. This 60,000comprises about 30,000 operational numbers with AA. gun batteries, towardswhich only approximately 18,000 suitable applicants have been obtained, leaving a deficit of 12,000. The other 30,000 women are required for manning searchlightsites, and only just over 1,000 suitable volunteers have come forward towards this requirement, leaving another 29,000 to be found.3. In short, there is a deficiency of some 41,000 women volunteers for A.A.operational duties, and the percentage of volunteers for this work has droppedsince the introduction of conscription for women. There are clearly limits to theextent to which approved AA. equipments can remain unmanned, and it means,therefore, that men badly wanted for duty with the Field Force will have to remain on anti-aircraft duties unless more women can be made available as substitutesfor them.4. This was one of the main points brought out in a War Office paper on the personnel situation in the Army which was discussed recently by the lord president, the Minister of Labour and National Service and myself. Thesuggestion was put forward at this meeting that there was in principle no objectionto members of the A.T.S. being &quot; directed &quot; to searchlight duties ; but it wasrecognized that any proposal to do this would have to be carefully examined inthe light of any public undertakings to the contrary which might have been given.5. When the War Cabinet had the question of compulsory national service for women under consideration on 10th November, 1941,* they agreed that nowomen who were compulsorily recruited into the Auxiliary Services should be entered for combatant service (i.e.t service which involved participation in the useof lethal weapons) unless they subsequently volunteered therefor.* W.M. (41) 110.
6. This aspect of compulsory service for women was raised in the subsequentdebates on the National Service No. 2 Bill in the House of Commons, in thecourse of which certain statements were made by Ministers, the matter beingsummed up in the Prime Ministers statement of 2nd December, which is the last of the quotations which are attached as Annex I.7. The statements by the Prime Minister arid the Minister of Labour and national Service might be regarded, on a somewhat restricted interpretation, as not preventing the Government applying compulsion to the A.T.S. to undertakesearchlight duties. But the remark of the Joint. Under-Secretary of State for War,particularly that &quot; I think that covers any anti-aircraft activity &quot;, is not so readilyopen to that interpretation.8. The need for freeing every available man for the Field Army is now,however, such a matter of urgency that I feel we should not stand too rigidly onthe actual form of these undertakings, provided their spirit is observed; and clearly there is nothing very lethal in the manipulation of a beam of light used to locate an enemy plane; in principle, searchlight duty is not far removed from thepassive air defence duties which women cheerfully undertake in the Civil defence services.9. Some months ago the Army Council agreed upon a scheme for the substi-tution of men by A.T.S. on selected searchlight sites throughout the country.This scheme provided the necessary safeguards as regards adequate accommodation(many detailed improvements were added to the normal men&apos;s accommodation scaleon searchlight sites), location of sites (the more invasion-threatened areas of thesouth and eastern coasts were excluded), and reasonable proximity to amenities(the sites chosen were to be within easy reach of populated places). The volunteers for the first ten searchlight groups have now been trained, and are about to deployon selected sites; but, apart from this small beginning, the whole scheme is nowheld, up -owing to the fall in A.T.S. intakes, since it has been necessary to concentrate on getting the badly needed A.A. gun operational numbers fromA.T.S. volunteers.10. It is now clear that unless suitable women from the age groups called up under the National Service Acts can be &quot; directed &quot; to searchlight duties, the plans for the substitution of men on these sites in appreciable numbers must falldown. In view of the urgent necessity for freeing every possible man fromA.D.G.B. for the Field Arm];, I seek approval to the compulsory posting of suitablemembers of the A.T.S. to searchlight duties. This would, of course, be done with due regard to medical fitness, age and the relevant personal considerations in eachcase.P. J. G.The War Office,8th August, 1941.
ANNEX IExtract from Hansard, 11th December, 1941, columns 1723/1725Mr. Bevin : We do not intend to introduce any disqualification of women to perform this service, but we have agreed, and have said in the White Paper, thatwe are prepared to make it a voluntary service. I am prepared to accept theprinciple of the Amendment, and I suggest these words:&quot; No woman who is called up for service under the principal Act shallbe required actually to use any lethal weapon or to take part in the actualuse of any lethal weapon unless she has signified in writing her willingness touse these weapons or, as the case may be, to take part in the use thereof.&quot;Mr. Bevin : I am trying to deal with the obligations of a woman under theBill, and they do not put her under an obligation to use weapons unless there isa second act on her part. That is the act of enrolment in those particular units which use lethal weapons. In order to do that she will be given a form on which she will signify her willingness to serve in those units. That is really how it willwork, and it will safeguard the great feeling in the country that women who havebeen called up for service will not be put willy nilly into combatant units.Mr. Mander : May I ask for a little information with regard to the definition of &quot; lethal weapons &quot; ? I understand that on the gun sites women are not being asked to handle lethal weapons at - all. I understand that a lethal weapon is something that is fired. There are other things, of which I will not say anything more, in manipulating which women do play their part. Does the term &quot; lethalweapons &quot; apply to the apparatus associated with the gun ?The Joint Under-Secretary of State for War (Sir Edward Grigg) :The words of the suggested amendment are :&quot; to use any lethal weapon or to take part in the actual use of any lethalweapon.&quot;I think that covers any anti-aircraft activity. I should like to assure myhon. Friend that this form is given only to those women who wish to undertake this kind of work. The women are free not to do it unless they signify their willingness in writing. All that we are. doing is to remove compulsion in thisparticular Service.Extract from the Prime Minister&apos;s Speech, 2nd December, 1941(Column 1047 OF Hansard)&quot; We do not propose, when once they have joined the A.T.S., to compelthem to serve in the lethal or combatant branches. Women will have the rightto volunteer, but no woman in the A.T.S. will be compelled to go to the batteries.It is a matter of quality of temperament, of feeling capable of doing this form of duty, which every woman must judge for herself, and not one in whichcompulsion should be used. I want to make it clear that a woman may be compelled to join the A.T.S., but only volunteers from within the A.T.S. will beallowed to serve with the guns.&quot;(b42/127)   80   8/42   w.o.p.   11432
