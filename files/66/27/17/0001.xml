SECRETDRAPT ftTATBMBNT ON PQ.17.It is now possible t6 give some account of the recentconvoy to North Russia which the enemy claimed to have practically annihilated.The losses which were suffered in this convoy were serious,but they did not approximate to the exaggerated claims putforward by the enemy,     The claims made by the enemy have,  infact, been of such a character that it is clear that the german high Command has no knowledge of the actual facts and has beenendeavouring, by disseminating exaggerated accounts, to extract information which will enable the claims and reportsof German pilots and U-Boafc commanders to be checked.     It isintended to-withhold information which would be of value tothe enemy, such as the number of ships which have arrived inRussia and the actual losses sustained.The known presence of enemy heavy units in the Norwegianfiords greatly.increased the possibility of attack on the convoyby powerful surface ships.       In order to counter this threat,strong British and U.S. naval forces were at sea, acting as cover for the convoy.       The lack of sea room owing to the iceconditions in the Barents Sea;    the perpetual daylight at this time of year;    and the existence of bases for strong enemy air andU-Boat forces along the flank of the convoy route, allcombined to make it impracticable for heavy surface forces to bekept in dose proximity with the convoy throughout the wholeof its voyage.In the event, the passage of this convoy was normal untilthe convoy was well to the eastward of Bear Island.       For somedays the convoy had been constantly shadowed by aircraft;    anumber of U-boats had tried to attack, and there had been two attacks by torpedo carrying aircraft.     The losses suffered bythe convoy during this period were not serious.At this stage as a result of aerial reconnaissance theinformation at the disposal of the Admiralty led to&quot;the conclusionthat an attack on the convoy by strong German surface forces was imminent. .   Orders were therefore given by the Admiralty for the convoy to disperse.   Cruisers and destroyers of the escort atonce formed a striking force with the object of attacking the enemybefore he could reach the merchant ships.An enemy heavy force, including the battleship TIRPITZ,did, in fact, put to sea and steered a course to intercept the convoy.     Soon afterwards, however, the TIRPITZ was attacked by a russian submarine, who claimed to have hit the battleship with twotorpedoes.     The Admiralty have no information as to damagesufferedby the TZRPIT2, but the enemy surface forces abandonedtheir attempt to intercept and destroy the ships of the convoy, andthey returned to the shelter of the fiords.     This decision onthe part of these very powerful enemy forces may have been due to damage suffered by their most important unit,    to unwillingness to risk the threat of submarine attack, demonstrated by the Russiansubmarinej    i*0 the danger of being brought to action by our heavyforces, or to reports that the convoy \had scattered and couldnot,&apos; therefore, be engaged as a whole.

The enemy decision to withdraw resulted in no contactbeing made between   our surface forces and those of theenemy.Unfortunately, the losses among the ships of the convoydue to air attack and U-boat attack increased after the convoyhad scattered.It is now possible to state that the loss of life amongthe crews of the merchant ships was happily not nearly asheavy as might have been expected.Admiralty, S.W.1.
