NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. Successful night operations have been carried out by our light craft inthe Channel.Two, possibly three, U-boats have been destroyed by ships of the royal canadian Navy, and a German U-boat has been sunk in the Levant.Shipping losses reported show a definite improvement. Two atlantic convoys have been attacked, and U-boats have been active off the easternapproaches to Trinidad.Home Waters.2. During the night of the 30th/31st July three M.G.B.&apos;s attacked enemylight craft off Boulogne, and seven M.G.B.&apos;s, while on patrol off Ymuiden,engaged five armed trawlers, one of which was set on fire. M.G.B. 332 was seriously damaged and had seven casualties. During both these engagements our forces were ineffectually engaged by enemy aircraft and shore batteries. On thefollowing night a force of M.T.B.&apos;s and M.G.B &apos;s attacked four E-boats escortinga merchant ship off the mouth of the Scheldt. Hits were observed, but no serious damage was claimed. On the night of the lst/2nd August four M.G.B.&apos;s, onoffensive patrol in the Channel, engaged four E-boats and two T.B.&apos;s offCherbourg. Two E-boats wrere destroyed and the remainder of the enemy force was damaged. Our force suffered two slight casualties and only minor damage.On the following night a brief action took place between five M.G.B.&apos;s and four enemy small craft which entered Boulogne before our force could engage at closequarters.H.M. Destroyer Lamerton was damaged in collision off the north coast ofIreland on the 31st July.During the week over 22,000 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or damaged by our aircraft.Northern Waters.3. It is reported that a Russian aircraft torpedoed and sank a 15,000-ton merchant ship at the entrance to Porsanger Fjord (north coast of Norwav) onthe 30th July.Mediterranean.4. Night bombing attacks by naval aircraft on enemy transport in the battle area have continued on a reduced scale. On the night of 28th/29th July E-boats were attacked off the Libyan coast. On two nights in the week naval aircraft have attacked enemy shipping at Mersa Matruh. A small vessel was probably sunk and a 2,500-ton ship damaged. Tank workshops in the vicinity were also hit.During the week the French submarine A rchimede and - 17,809 tons ofmerchant shipping westbound and 26,203 tons eastbound have passed through theStraits of Gibraltar under escort.East Indies.5. On the 2nd August a naval aircraft from H.M.S. Formidable shot down a Japanese four-engined flying boat to the east of Trincomalee.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. H.M. Canadian ships Skeena and Wetaskiwin, escorting an outward-bound convoy, sank a U-boat on the 31st July 700 miles north-east of new foundland. Three days later H.M. Canadian Corvette Sackville, escortingthe same convoy, claimed to have destroyed a U-boat and damaged another by gunfire. On the 6th H.M. Canadian Destroyer A ssiniboine, escorting a homeboundconvoy, sank a U-boat 650 miles north-east of Cape Race. Thirty-six prisoners were captured.- A promising attack was carried out east of the Azores byH.M. Sloops Rochester, Sandwich and Erne escorting an outward-bound convoy
to Freetown. H.M. Destroyer Sikh, with H.M. Ships Croome, Tetcott andPrimula, sank a German U-boat off Haifa on the 4th August. There have beenten other attacks by surface craft: two off Freetown, three by our convoy escortsand five by United States warships.Seventeen attacks have been carried out by Coastal Command and by U.S.A.aircraft based on Iceland (C). Of these nine were in the Bay of Biscay, onenear the Azores and the remainder in the Iceland (C) area. Two attacks by .S.A. aircraft probably caused damage. Ten attacks were (Carried out by .S.A. and British aircraft in the Western Atlantic, but no detail Is of these attacks are known at present.Enemy Intelligence.German.7.   There is no change in the dispositions of main units in Northern Waters.Photographic reconnaissance of &quot;Gdynia on the 1st August showed that theaircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin has now had her main and secondary armamentinstalled and should be nearing completion. The Gneisenau was seen with hermain and secondary armament removed and. with 120 feet of the forecastle deckcut away.Ten German E-boats and possibly about 15 R-boats are reported to be inthe Black Sea.Raider Activity.8. Both the United States tanker William Humphrey (7,982 tons) and theNorwegian s.s Aramis (7,984 tons), which were recently sunk in the South Atlanticby raider attack, are known to have been actually sunk by E-boats carried by theraider. The raider itself is said to be of 3,500 tons and to be in company with a supply ship of 10,000 tons.Japanese.9. The main strength of the Japanese Fleet is concentrated in home waters,but some important units, including two 0-inch cruisers and a destroyer flotilla,have arrived in the Singapore area. All the aircraft carriers are believed to beexercising in home waters.U-boats.10. There has been considerable activity in the eastern approaches toTrinidad and off the Azores. U-boats have been operating off the north-west andsouth-west coasts of Iceland (C) and, in the South Atlantic, to the north of st. Helena. Japanese U-boats have been reported off the south and south-eastcoasts of Australia.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ending the 2nd/3rd August 1,057 ships, including279 Allied and 30 neutral, have been convoyed. Of these 176 were in ocean convoys and 881 in British coastal convoys. One armed merchant cruiser, three anti-aircraft ships, 54 destroyers (including four U.S.A. destroyers) and 95 sloops,cutters and corvettes were employed on escort duty. Since the beginning of thewar 592 ships have been lost out of 128,536 ships which have been convoyed.During the past week 82 ships in four .ocean convoys arrived in home waters without loss.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 1st August totalled 731,000 tons, compared with 722,000 tons duringthe previous seven days and an average of 642,500 tons for the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports 253,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.12. Fifteen ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boats duringthe week; of these, six are known to have been sunk. Three ships in an outward-bound convoy and one ship in a homeward-bound convoy were torpedoed in[24204] b
the West Atlantic. One ship in a United States coastal convoy was sunk inthe Gulf of Mexico. Five ships were attacked to the east of Trinidad, oneoff Cape Race, one to the west of Freetown, one off the south coast of Iceland (C)and two off the south and south-east coasts of Australia respectively.The s.s. Yeivglen (607 tons), off Littlehampton, was slightly damaged by two aircraft, one of which she destroyed. A British tanker, in coastal convoy,was damaged off Start Point in an attack by six torpedo-bomber aircraft, twoof which were hit by gunfire of the convoy and escorting destroyers. Subsequenttorpedo attacks on the convoy were unsuccessfully carried out by E-boats, atleast two of which were hit.No ships have been sunk or damaged by mines.British Minelaying.13. During the week mines have been laid by surface craft in the Faroes-Iceland (C) Barrage. Minelaying by aircraft has been carried out off theGerman North Sea coast and in the Bay of Biscay.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.14. On two nights of the week enemy aircraft may have laid mines offthe East Coast, and on one night minelaying by aircraft was suspected in the bristol Channel.E-boats were active on one night to the south of the Isle of Wight.Nine magnetic and 27 moored mines have been destroyed during the week.The mine totals are : 2,522 magnetic, 1.316 acoustic and 1,474 moored.Foreign Waters.15. A heavy, unexplained explosion occurred on the 4th in the bay to thenorth-of Gibraltar harbour. One of the seven known mines off Alexandria was destroyed on the 28th July.Ground-mines, considered to be acoustic, have been found in and near the boom defence gate at Port Castries, St. Lucia. A United States launchwas sunk on the 29th when passing through the gate and another mine wasexploded by two motor torpedo boats on the 1st August. Two more mines were destroyed by a United States minesweeper on the 2nd.The Suez Canal is open, though traffic in the southern part is subject tocontrol.On the 5th minesweepers off Port Said were attacked by two enemy aircraftone of which was shot down by H.M. Minesweeper Fareham.Enemy Merchant Shipping.16.   There is definite evidence that 87 Japanese merchant ships and11 tankers have been sunk up to the end of July.Vichy Merchant Shipping.17. The tanker Frimaire (9,242 tons), which was reported to be in Aruba onthe 23rd July, sailed for an unknown destination the next day. She had pre-viously disappeared when she left Aruba on the 14th June, ostensibly for Covenas,Colombia. She is under charter to the Portuguese Government, and her crew istwo-thirds French and one-third Portuguese. She is believed to be carrying some550 tons of oil.The He D&apos; Ouessant (6,187 tons) arrived at Curacao on the 28th July from new York, and the He De Noirmoutier&apos; (5,703 tons) sailed from New York for .Curacao on the 24th July.   Both ships are bound for Casablanca.   Two similarships are due to leave North Africa for the U.S.A.Russian Intelligence.- &apos;, 18. Russian naval aircraft, in the period between the 29th June and the24th July, carried out 36 raids (212 sorties) on enemy positions in northern norway, &quot;during which period photographs show that they destroyed a hangar,two workshops, two petrol dumps and two aircraft on the ground; they also claim
to have sunk a tanker. Russian fighters in the extreme north made 1,139 sorties and claim to have destroyed 21 enemy aircraft. Sixteen more are claimed to havebeen destroyed by anti-aircraft fire.MILITARY SITUATION.Egypt.19. Activity during the week has been confined to patrolling on both sides.The enemy appears to be consolidating on his present line and strengtheninghis position by laying further minefields. Mines removed in the Sanyet ElMiteiriya sector during our limited offensive, referred to in last week&apos;s Resume,have since been replaced by the enemy.The Russo-German Campaign.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this Resume.)Finland.20.   In Northern Finland, where the front has been quiet for a long time,fighting has been resumed, but there is no information as to its scale.Northern and Central Sectors.21. The Russians have made local attacks on the River Volkhov, at Rzhevand near Bryansk.Voronezh Sector.22. After a brief lull, the Russians resumed their attacks against theGerman northern flank north-west of Voronezh and against the only Germanbridgehead west of Voronezh. Although little ground was gained, it is possiblethat these attacks have contained enemy forces needed elsewhere. There has been no activity on the Upper Don from Voronezh to Boguchar.Stalingrad Sector.23. In the Don bend continuous German pressure towards Stalingrad has met with strong Russian resistance, and in the northern part of the bend, north-west of Kalach, the Germans have made little progress. At Nizhne Chirsk theenemy has established a small bridgehead. At this point the railway crosses theriver, but it is not known whether the Germans captured the bridge intact.Lower Don and Caticasus Sector.24.   From the mouth of the Don as far as Tsimlyansk the Germans are incomplete control of both banks of the river.   They have advanced rapidly,southwards, and their claim to have reached the River Kuban, some 130 miles south of the Don, may well be true.Summary.25. The Germans have made little further progress towards Stalingrad, butthey continue to advance towards the Caucasus at considerable speed. The factthat there have still been no claims to prisoners suggests that the Russians have succeeded in withdrawing a considerable proportion of their troops, but it ispossible that the Germans are waiting until they can announce a suitablydramatic total of prisoners. There is no sign of any change in the enemy&apos;s immediate plans, namely, to drive eastwards towards Stalingrad and southwardstowards the Caucasus.Far East.New Guinea-New Britain.26. Patrol encounters continue in the Kokoda area (Papua), where theestimated Japanese strength is 400.Solomon Islands.27. The Japanese consolidation continues and their estimated strength inGuadalcanal-Tulagi is now 4,500.[24204]     &quot; b 2
AIR SITUATION.General.28. A successful attack on Dusseldorf was made by a strong force of bombers, but otherwise no large scale raids were carried out owing to unsuitableweather.Air activity in Egypt was on a smaller scale.United Kingdom.29.   Fighter Command flew 1,025 defensive sorties by day and 587 by night.Enemy activity by day was on a slightly higher scale than last week, a totalof 70 sorties flying overland. Thirty of these were flown on the 3rd August, whenadvantage was taken of cloud cover over Yorkshire, East Anglia and EastMidlands.At night, a total of 130 enemy aircraft operated against this country corn-pared with 220 in the previous week. The heaviest raid was made on the night30th/31st July by 45 aircraft, which concentrated mainly on the Wolverhamptonand Walsall areas.Twenty-three enemy aircraft were destroyed (including two by A.A. guns),three were probably destroyed and 19 were damaged.Germany and Occupied Territory.Bay.30 Fighter and Bomber Commands despatched 1,392 and 74 offensive sorties respectively, compared, with 624 and 136 last week. About 30 tons ofH.E. were released.On. the 30th July, Hurricane bombers attacked Abbeville-Drucat aerodromeand, on the following day, this target and the docks at St. Malo were bombed by Bostons, with results given in Appendix VII. Escorts to these operations and fighter sweeps by Spitfires resulted in a number of combats in which 18 enemy fighters were shot down, three more probably destroyed and damage inflicted on14 others. Twenty of our fighters and four Hurricane-bombers did not returnbut two fighter pilots were rescued.Bostons successfully raided Flushing (see Appendix VII) and, in addition,our fighters and fighter-bombers carried out a number of individual attacks onlocomotives, barges, gun-posts and other small objectives in enemy-occupied territory.Night.31. Bomber Command made 719 aircraft sorties against land targets and14 aircraft dropped propaganda leaflets. A total of 1,115 tons of bombs was dropped.The only major operation was on Dusseldorf, 630 aircraft were despatched and 29 did not return. The attack was made in favourable weather and was completed within 80 minutes, during which time 575 tons of H.E.(including 168x4,000 lbs.) and 322 of incendiaries were concentrated on the target. Large fires were still burning on the following day and photographsdisclose considerable damage, details of which are outlined in Appendix VII.Our bombers shot down four intercepting fighters.Weather prevented further large-scale attacks during the rest of the week,though 50 tons of bombs were dropped at Essen on one night, under conditions\   which precluded observation of results.A total of 84 &quot; Intruder &quot; aircraft operated over aerodromes and againstother targets in occupied territory. One enemy aircraft was destroyed overOrleans; three of our aircraft did not return.Coastal Operations.32. Coastal Command flew 653 sorties, of which 24 were on convoy escort.Shipping protection patrols by Fighter Command involved 906 sorties.Bomb-carrying Hurricanes destroyed a ship of 1,000 tons and damaged two others off the coast of Brittany.  Near Borkum, hits with torpedoes are believed
to have been made by Hampdens on vessels of 6,000 and 3,000 tons, and Hudsonsclaim hits on three other vessels of approximately 6,000, 5,000 and 1,500 tons.Later in the week attacks on a convoy in the same area and on another off theHook of Holland were carried out in difficult weather with unobserved results.A total of 111 aircraft of Bomber Command laid 298 sea-mines in enemy waters.  Three of these aircraft are missing.An increased number of Coastal Command aircraft were engaged in anti-submarine operations in the Bay of Biscay, the week&apos;s sorties amounting to 185.Two German seaplanes were shot down and. three of our aircraft are missing.Mediterranean.Egypt and Libya.33. Our air operations were on a smaller scale owing to sandstorms and thestatic state of ground operations. In the week ending the 3rd August our aircraft flew 1,611 sorties compared with 2,686 in the previous week.Enemy landing grounds, M.T., camps, tank workshops and other military targets were successfully attacked by light and fighter bombers by day, and by liberators, &quot;Wellingtons and light bombers by night. Considerable damage was caused to motor vehicles, especially to a concentration of 2,000 in the CentralSector.Our fighters carried out numerous reconnaissances and offensive patrols overthe battle front.Tobruk was attacked on six nights by a total of about 290 Wellingtons,30 Halifaxes, 5 Liberators and 4 United States Fortresses. At least seven ships were hit, three of which were set on fire, and near misses were obtained on others.Several fires were started among fuel cisterns and petrol installations.The harbours at Mersa Matruh, Sollum and Bardia were attacked at nightby Wellingtons and Bostons. Among the targets hit were two merchant vessels,several barges, jetties, barracks, tank workshops and petrol dumps.Enemy operations were again on a reduced scale. In the battle area activity was chiefly confined to defensive patrols by single-engined fighters and toreconnaissance flights. Long-range bombers operating from Crete carried outattacks on aerodromes around Cairo, the principal target being Heliopolis.Ju. 52s, escorted by twin-engine fighters, continued to bring troops, supplies and equipment from Crete to North Africa.In all these operations our fighters destroyed seven enemy aircraft, probably destroyed two and damaged four.  We lost 24 aircraft, but four pilots are safe.Malta.34. Enemy attacks on the Island were on a slightly larger scale than lastweek, and were carried out by small formations of Ju. 88s, escorted by Me. 109sand some Italian fighters.In several instances the raiders were intercepted before reaching the coast and forced to jettison their bombs in the sea. A few fighter sweeps, consistingof 20 to 30 German and Italian aircraft, were flown over the Island at a greatheight.Our fighters destroyed seven enemy aircraft and damaged three. We losteight Spitfires, but five pilots are safe.Greece.35. Shipping in Navarino Harbour was bombed by Liberators on fournights of the week.Sea Communications.36. A southbound convoy was bombed by Liberators 80 miles north ofDerna. Two hits and several near.misses were obtained on a large merchant vessel, which was left in a sinking condition.Another enemy convoy, consisting of three large merchant vessels and eight destroyers, was attacked by Liberators 150 miles N.W. of Derna. One merchant vessel was probably hit, and near misses were obtained on the other two.  A few
hours later a second attack was made by Wellingtons, but a smoke screen fromthe destroyers prevented observation of results.Our light and fighter bombers made several attacks on barges off the EgyptianCoast. At least six barges were sunk, one was set on fire and others were seriously damaged.Several reconnaissances were made of harbours in Sicily, Crete and the^aegean Sea.Russia.37. The main weight of the German air offensive in South Russia was directed against the forces in the Don bend defending Stalingrad and againstcommunications north and south of Stalingrad. River traffic and railway ferrieson the Volga were attacked and the river was mined. Attacks were also made onthe railway running north from Astrakhan along the east bank of the Volga.Pacific Zone.38. Hits are claimed by Allied aircraft on a destroyer off Gona (new guinea) and probably on a cruiser off Banda Island. Off Salamaua (New Guinea)a ship was hit and a small vessel set on fire. Objectives in the islands to thenorth of Port Darwin (including Kei, Tanimbar, Aru and Banda) and in theKokoda and Gona (New Guinea) areas were attacked.On 29th July and the following day a total of 38 Japanese bombers, with22 fighters as escort, attacked Darwin; water mains and cables were hit andtwo fuel dumps destroyed. Kittyhawks shot down seven fighters and two bombers.On 29th July a small force of enemy bombers ineffectively attacked Port Moresby,and on the 30th nine aircraft bombed the aerodrome at Port Hedland (Western Australia), causing negligible damage.China.39. During the 29th, 30th and 31st July a total of 100 Japanese aircraftattempted to attack Hengyang aerodrome (350 miles N.N.W. of Canton). It isreported that aircraft of the U.S. Army Air Corps (four of which are missing, allpilots safe) shot down four bombers and 13 fighters and probably destroyed fourmore bombers.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.40. During the past week bombing incidents have been reported on four days and on six nights. Much of the enemy effort has been wasted and although,owing to the large proportion of incendiaries dropped, numerous fires were started, little serious damage was done. Casualties for the past fortnight, how-ever, have been considerably heavier than any recorded since the Spring whenBath and Exeter were heavily raided.By Day.41. On the 31st July Teignmouth was bombed and machine-gunned; a fewhouses were demolished and six people were killed. York and Lincoln were attacked on the morning of the 2nd August and that evening Bridport was bombed; no damage of consequence was done, but there were a few fatal casualties.On the 3rd Middlesbrough was attacked and serious damage was done to theL.N.E. Railway Station; a number of people were killed at Goole, Wellingboroughand at Torquay. Southwick and Hove were bombed on the morning of the4th, when residential property was damaged and there were&apos; a number of casulties.By Night.42. On the night 30th/31st July the Midlands were attacked, for thesecond night in succession and for the third time in four nights. Birminghamwas again bombed., but the main concentration was on the Wolverhampton-Walsall district, where numerous fires were started and utility and transport
services were affected. Minor incidents were also reported from Lincolnshire,Northamptonshire, Huntingdonshire, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Staffordshire,Warwickshire and Worcestershire. Casualties were much lighter than at birmingham on the previous night.On the night 31st July/1st August Hull was bombed; minor damage was done to the docks and a number of houses in the vicinity were demolished;24 people were killed. On the same night a number of incidents were reported from Norfolk and Yorkshire.On the night lst/2nd August, Norwich was raided and a number of fires were started. A gas main was fractured and substantial damage was done to commercial and domestic premises. There were very few serious casualties, but500 people had to be accommodated in rest centres.On the remaining nights of the week, with the exception of the night 3rd/4th,on which no bombing occurred, minor incidents have been reported : Night2nd/3rd, from Northamptonshire, Leicestershire, Bedfordshire, East Anglia,Dorset and Warwickshire. Night 4th/5th, from Somerset, Devon, Glamorgan,Monmouthshire, Pembrokeshire. Night 5th/6th, from Yeovil and four villagesin the neighbourhood of Dorchester.Damage.43. On the night 30th/31st July serious damage was done to SamuelParkes, Ltd., at Willenhall. Other factories doing work of national importance which were affected to a lesser extent on the same night were: AtWolverhampton: British Oxygen, Ltd., Chillington Tube Co., Ltd., GuyMotors, Ltd., Ever Ready Co., Ltd. (Canal Works and Park Lane Works),Chubb and Sons. At Bilston: Wednesbury Tube Co., Ltd. At Wednesbury:Bean Industries, Ltd. At Coventry: Daimler Co., Ltd.

APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week : Dusseldorf.Photographs taken during the morning of 1st August show the followingdamaged factory property : (a) At the Schiess Defries works four large buildings wrecked and others damaged. This works is specializing in the production of magnetic mines.(b) The Hermes paper factory entirely destroyed.(e) The main building of the Dusseldorf worsted mills completely destroyed and other buildings in the works damaged.(d) The main shop of the Krieger steel works (manufacturers of steelcastings) severely damaged by a direct hit, and other buildings in theworks damaged.(e) The main shops of the Limon Fluhme engineering works completely destroyed.(/) The chemical works in the Neuss district  still on fire when the photographs were taken.(g) Buildings in the Phcenix steel tube works, the Kallen oil cake manu-facturers and the Stettin alcohol works destroyed or damaged.The damage to other industrial, business and residential property in thetown and suburbs is extensive. In the main it is centred in the harbour and themain station area, and the southern districts of Friederichsstadt and Oberbilk.Saarbrucken.An immediate interpretation of photographs shows : (a) About a  quarter of the Ehrhardt and Schmer  engineering worksdestroyed.(b) About half the buildings of the main goods station destroyed, and severalsheds to the north of the main passenger station severely damaged.(c) The roofs of five shops in the Burbacher ironworks seriously damaged,(a) Considerable damage by fire and high explosive to residential property in the Malstatt, Burbacher and St. Johann districts.-     - -   &apos; .Duisburg.        : ...      ...      .,.....An immediate interpretation of photographs reveals : (a) Warehouses on the quay side of the inner harbour and at the railwaydock at Laar. destroyed.       ...(b) The Thyssen steel works damaged.(c) Shops in the Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G. and the Deutsche Maschinen-fabrik A.G. hit, and the tram depot damaged......- .(d) The main station hit.(e) Considerable damage to business and residential property in the town.Ground sources report that in the attack on the 21st July the NiederheinischeHutte and the Krupps works were hit in addition to Thyssen steel works, and suffered considerable damage. In previous attacks a yard building Rhine bargeswas damaged; fires caused considerable damage to a chemical works and a tobaccofactory supplying the armed forces was burnt out, together with its storage
Hamburg.Photographs taken on the 28th July, 1942, do not cover the whole of the city and suburbs, and some areas ai*e obscured by cloud. Considerable damage isdisclosed, however, mostly by fire, in the centre of the city and districts to theeast. Business premises, public buildings, warehouses in the docks and the oldtown area, and a considerable amount of domestic property is seen to have been destroyed or severely damaged. The individual items of damage are numerous,but the most heavily burnt-out area is to the south-west of the Binnen Alster.The destruction in this area must have had considerable effect upon the popula-tion, for it comprised not only the main shopping centre, including the largestdepartment store in the city, but also Hamburg&apos;s famous and internationallyknow cafe, the Alster Pavilion, on the lake-side.Flensburg.In photographs taken on 28th July, there is considerable cloud shadow andthe quality is not good.
