BRIDGES.Secretary of the War CabinetGreat George Street, SoW0loSTRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL FOR THE PRIME MINISTER from the PRESIDENTNoo 172 30th July, 1942I have today received a long and urgent message from Chiang Kai Shek.   He asks me to regard this message asstrictly confidential;, but in view of its nature I naturallywish to inform you immediately of its contents.The following is the text of this message:&quot;With both sides remaining adamant in their views, theIndian situation has reached an extremely tense and criticalstage.   Its development in fact constitutes the most important factor in determining the outcome of the United Nations warand especially the war in the East,   The war aims which the anti-aggression nations have proclaimed to the world aretwo-fold, first to crush brute force and second to securefreedom for all mankinds   If India should start a movementagainst Britain or against the United Nations, this will cause deterioration in the Indian situation from which the axis powers will surely reap benefit.   Such an eventuality

will seriously affect the whole course of the war and at thesame time the world might entertain doubts as to the sincerity of the lofty war aims of the United Nations,    This will notonly prove a great disadvantage to Britain but v/ill alsoreflect    discredit to the democratic front-&quot;At this juncture the United Nations should do their best, when there is yet time, to prevent the occurrence ofsuch an unfortunate state of affairs0   Your country is the leader in this war of right against might and yourExcellency-s views have always received serious attention in Britain^.   Furthermore for a long time the Indian people have been expecting the United States to come out and take a stand on the side of justice and equalityo    I thereforeventure to lay before you my personal views on this question.&quot;Inevitably Britain will regard the Indian national congress recent demand as an attempt to take advantage ofher present prodicamento   The step contemplated by theresolution of the Congress Working Committee, however, stillleaves sufficient time and opportunity for the reaching ofan agreemen to    During ray recent^visit to India.? I earnestlyadvised the Indian people to consider their primary duty tojoin the anti-aggression front in a common struggle formankindo&quot;Prom the point of view of the Indian people,- theirconsistent purpose is to secure national freedom^   Withthis object in view the Indian National Congress, io seekingnational independence, is dominated by sentiment rather thanby reason0    Consequently I believe attempts at repressionin the form of either public censure or force, whethermilitary or police with a view to compelling the indian people to capitulate? will have the opposite result.&quot;Prom the psychological point of view of the Indian, he considers that India before attaining her National Freedomis not the master of her own. vast territory and abundantresources *    Just because he owns nothing, he has nothing to be afraid ofr    Moreover beyond National Independence and freedom he demands nothing of the worlds   Likewise theIndian people as a whole only des-ire Freedom for theircountry and their only expectation is that the united nations would sympathise with them in their aspirations.&quot;The Indian people are by nature of a passive dispositionbut are apt to go to extremes.    I think that in launchingits freedom movement today when Axis aggression is a pressingreality, the Indian Congress must have felt in their heartsa certain amount of ai\,aisho    If however the United nations should show them no sympathy and pursue a laissez faire policyand thereby cause them to despair, I greatly fear tHa/fT&quot;following the National Congress meeting in August there isdanger of the situation getting out of controls    In case on anti-British movement or some other unfortunate incidentoccurs in Indiay the United Nations war in the East will be adversely affected immediately.   For the sake of our commonvictory the United Nations must seek to stabilise the Indiansituation and to secure the Indian peoples participation in the joint war offorto&quot;The United Nations depend upon India for her tocontribute to&apos;the war whereas the Indian people have littleneed to depend upon the outside worldo   From their own pointof view their movement for independence and freedom is notsomething new that has come into existence after the

i Uoutbreak of the wapo   Hence they do not stop bo think whether their movement will have any harmful effect on the world situation..   This being the case they have no hesitation intaking whatever steps they may think necessary in furtherance oftheir national Movement,-,   Whether they are right or wrong isimmaterial?    The fact remains they have now already hecomeirresponsive to even well considered public opinion or a realistic analysis of India&apos;s real interests.    Once theyabandon hope of an aaicable settlement; the/ are liable totake any rink without hesitation even&apos;  to the extent ofsacrificing themselves and others?&quot;The only way to make them reconsider their course ofaction is for the United Nations., and es- jcially the unitedStates which v-      have always admired^ to come forth as third parties and to offer them sympathy and eonsolation0   Thiswill help thern to regain their sense of proportion and strengthen their faith that there is justice in this world?Once tho situation is eased it can be stabilised and the indian people,, grateful to the United Nations for- what they have done,wile willingly participate in the war?    Otherwise the indian people in despair will have the same feeling towards othermembers of the United Nations as towards Britain and when this comes to pass it will be the world&apos;5 s greatest tragedy inwhich Britain is not the only loser--,&quot;So far as Britain is concerned she is agxxxi countryand in rece: .t years she has been pursuing an enlightenedpolicy towards her Colonial possessions.-.    She is one ofthe principals In this war against aggression?.    On the otherhand India is a weak country    With this unpreeedentlyextensive war in progress? naturally things cannot be handled in the ordinary manner o    It is my opinion that inorder to uphold the British Empire-V prestige and safe-guardher real interests? the British should unhesitatingly showextraordinary courage, forbearance? far-sightedness andresolution by removing the causes which tend to aggravate the situation.    In this way the deceptive Axis -propagandistswill have no occasion to take advantage of these causesQShould however the situation be allowed to drift until an anti-British movement breaks out in India, any attempt on thepart of the British to cope with the crisis by enforcingexisting Colonial laws or by resorting to military and police force, will only help to spread disturbances andturmoij.0    The greater the oppression^. the greater the reaction^   Even if such measures should prove effective incurbing the non violence movement,  the spiritual loss andblow to the United Nations will far exceed that resultingfrom any reverse in the fieldo    Such a situation willparticularly be detrimental to British interests?&quot;There is no doubt a section of the Indian peoplewhich,, having lost their sense of proportion., is askingif India will never obtain freedom,-, what choice does shehave between Britain and Axis powers0    This mistaken ideathe United Nations should of course do everything possibleto vcorrect0    On the other hand the wisest the most enlightenedpolicy for Britain to pursue would be to restore to India hercomplete freedom and thus to prevent Axis troops from settingfoot on Indian soil*   If Britain would reorientate her present attitude and spirit? I firmly believe that not   only will Indiansentiment towards Britain undergo radical change for the betterbut Britain&apos;s action will have an ameliorating effect on thewhale situation^   Therefore I earnestly hope that the UnitedStates would advise both Britain and India in the name ofjustice and righteousness to seek a reasonable and satisfactory

solution for this affects vitally the welfare of mankind andhas a direct bearing on the good faith and good name of theUnited Nations0   The United States as the acknowledged leader of democracy has a natural and vital role to play In bringing about a successful solution of the problem^    In saying so Ihave not the slighest intention to arouse attention byexaggerated statements.    The war aims of the United nations and our common interests at stake make it impossible- for meto remain silent.   An ancient Chinese proverb Bays;    &apos;fGoodmedicine, though bitter: cures ones illness;    words of sincereadvice, though unpleasant, should guide ones conduct&quot;0&quot;I sincerely hope that Britain will magnan mously andresolutely accept my words of disinterested advice., howeverunpleasant they may be, and believe that they are voiced Inthe common interests of the United   NationsQ&quot;In view of the critical situation and In view of China*2responsibilities as a member   of the United Nations, I haveventured to offer you my views0    This despatch is strictly confidential.    It is only for your Excellency?s personalreference,   I hope your Excellency will give the minutestconsideration to such practical measures as will break theexisting deadlock and avert a crisiso    I shall persevere inmy efforts.   My only feeling is that the United nations should lose no   time in adopting a correct policy towards theIndian situation and in striving for its realisation so thatour entire war effort will not suffer a major set backo    Iardently hope Your Excellency will favour me with your soundJudgment.&quot;I shall have to give a reply to Chiang Kai Shek inthe near future and I shall be grateful if you will let mehave as soon as possible your thoughts and any suggestionsyou may wish to offer with regard tothe nature of the reply should make to him(Signed) ROOSEVELT   -PRIME MINISTER TO PRESIDENTPersonal -an^ secret no, 125Your 172.1.     We do not agree with Chiang Kai Shsk&apos;s estimate of theIndian situation.   The Congress Party in no way representsIndia and is strongly opposed by over 90 million Mohammedans,40 million Untouchables, and the Indian States comprising some90 millions, to whom we are bound by treaty   Congressrepresents mainly the intelligentsia of ^on^f ighting Hinduelements, and can neither defend India nor raise a revoltoThe military classes on whom everything depends are thoroughlyloyal, in fact over a million feave volunteered for theArmy and the numbers recently volunteering greatly exceedall previous records.   Their loyalty would be gravely impairedby handing over the Government of India to Congress control.The reckless delarations of Congress have moreover given riseto widespread misgiving, even among its own rank and fileo

2.     The Government of India have no doubt of their ability to maintain order and carry on government with efficiency and secure Indians maximum contribution to the war effortwhatever Congress may say or even do, provided of course that their authority is not undermined.   His majesty&apos;s government here have no intention of making any offer beyondthe sweeping proposals which Sir Stafford Cripps carried toIndia and in fact could not do so without creating graveinternal trouble in India.    So far as I am concerned, I couldnot accept responsibility for making further proposals atthis stage.   We have however only today in Parliament made clear that while the specific proposals suggested by Crippsfailed to secure agreement we ,stand firmly by the broadintention of our offer which is that India should have thefullest opportunity at the earliest possible moment afterthe war to attain to complete self-government underconstitutional arrangements of her own devising.   I earnestlyhope therefore, Mr. President, that you will do your best to dissuade Chiang Kai Shek from his completely misinformedactivities, and will lend no countenance to putting pressure upon His Majesty&apos;s Government.(Intld.)     W.S.C.31.7.42.&quot;5m
