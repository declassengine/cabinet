[HIS DOCUMENT IS THE1 PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. rt,TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY0 * g &apos;gIt is requested that special care may be taken to ensurethe secrecy of this document,,SECRETobi^August, 1942Copy NOoWAR    cabinet memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.Russian Warships and Merchant Ships in the Black Sea.,The Russians are in danger of losing their last bases on theWest Caucasian Coast, and I have had to consider whether there is any useful action we can take to try and save some of the RussianWarships and Merchant Ships in the Black SeacWAR SHIPS(ifV1920      The Russian Black Sea Fleet, according to,such information as wehave, consists of one old battleship, 4 cruisers, 2 of which are new(1940=41), one new flotilla leader, 6 modern destroyers, 4 old destroyers,9 small destroyers and 24 submarines,3c     The Montreux Convention provides that the warships of a belligerentshall not pass through the Straits except where they have become -separated from their bases, in which case they may return.,      Theexception was designed only for the case when at the outbreak of war,warships of either a Blaok Sea or non Black Sea Power were the wrongside of the Straits,  and required to make a passage to return to theirbaseQ      In strict law, therefore, the Russian war ships have no other alternative except to destroy themselves, or suffer internment in a turkish pcrto4o     The present military situation renders it extremely unlikelythat the Turks will connive at the passage of Russian surface warshipsthrough the Straits.      Last April, the Turkish General Staff informedAdmiral Kelly that Russian warships would not even be allowed toproceed to the sea of Marmara for internment without first going toEregli to be disarmted.      They would not be permitted to pass theBosphoros except disarmed and under Turkish escort.      Admiral Kelly ina signal of 10th August, has confirmed that this is the attitude of theTurkish General Staff and has added that even if the Russian tankersapproach the Bosphoros before being disarmed, the Turks will open fire.5.     Should the Russians attempt to break through in the face ofdetermined Turkish action in the Bosphoros and Dardanelles, and of enemy action in the Mediterranean,  the chance of the surface shipssurviving would be slight,,      Moreover, hostilities would have brokenout between two of our allies, with incalcuable consequences to theMiddle East strategic situation.      The best therefore that can happen to the Russian Surface ships seems to be internment in a Turkish port.The position of the submarines may be somewhat different, since it may be some of these to make the passage to the Mediterranean,ifthe Turks are not too assiduous in carrying out their .the Montreux Convention,,possible forjparticularlyLduties underreasonable chance of saving somethingRussians can be persuaded to transferTurkso      We are under an obligation to end of this year two new Fleet DestroyersI therefore consider that we should suggest to thei bargain on the following lines0      The Russians60 There may, however, be aIjout of such a disaster if theBsorne of their warships to theindeliver to Turkey towards the&quot;and two submarines,pass ^rtks-^Northern Fleet the two destroyers and submarines at present destineafor Turkey.    .

Admiralty, S.W.1.lWth August, 1942.The Turks will not fail to have memories of the GOEBEN and the BRESLAUduring the last war, and if they want a modern precedent there is therecent sale of the German U-boat at Cartagena to the Spaniards,,      In thelatter case, the Spaniards claimed that as the sale had taken place before their obligation to intern the U-boat became effective, they were under nodut f to intern the crew.      There might be some advantage in the Russiansagreeing to sell and transfer the specified warships before they were compelled to take refuge in Turkish ports, because it might be possiblein this way to save their crews from internment,,      No doubt Russian MerchantSh. js could be employed to remove the warships&apos;  crews.MERCHANT SHIPS.7o      The main item is the Black Sea tanker fleet, which according to ourlatest information consists of some 20 tankers, totalling 94,380 tons, withspeeds varying from 13^ to 8 knots.      It is most important that these ships should not be available to the Germans, as their acute shortage of tankersin the Black Sea may prove the chief obstacle to the Axis making full useof the Caucasian oil, but we can presumably rely on the Russians destroyingtheir ships rather than allow them to be capturedo      The Tankers and othermerchant ships are in an entirely different position from the warships, since they have a right under the Montreux Convention to pass through the Straits,and as long as they are genuine merchant ships the Turks ought not to insist on depriving them of their defensive armament,,      It appears,&apos;however, from admiral Kelly&apos;s signal of the 10th August that the Turks may insist oncomplete disarmament even of the merchant ships before allowing them passage,.This would be a serious disadvantage if the Russians eventually decide topass some of the ships into the Mediterranean.80     Last autumn, before the German advance had been halted, the RussianChief of Naval Staff approached Admiral Miles for our assistance in getting a Russian Icebreaker and some tankers out of the Black Sea.      Wethen pointed out that escort could not be provided until the ships were clear of the Aegean, but said that we were ready to send Naval officers to Istanbul to help in working the ships out through Turkish territorial waters.      In the event, five ships made the attempt,  of which four arrivedsafely in Egypt.      The success of these operations was undoubtedly due ina large measure to the help given by the Turks, whose sympathy was enlistedby the Russians tankers discharging up to 25,000 tons of much needed oilat Istanbul for the Turks.9.     I propose that the Russians should be informed at once that these arrangements can be made again if they so desire, and that they shouldbe encouraged to send their merchant ships forthwith to Istanbul, or otherTurkish ports,  to await the  result of the Battle of the Caucasus.      In viewof the present situation over the Second Front, it is probably undesirable to invite them to pass their ships immediately into the Mediterranean.If the War Cabinet approve my suggestions concerning the RussianWarships and -Merchant ships in the Black Sea I should propose to send to admiral Miles and Admiral Kelly the signal annexed to this paper.

DRAFT SIGNAL.Admiral MilesAdmiral Kelly(R) Co  in Co , Mediterranean,August, 1942,MOST SECRET.IMMEDIATE(^rom Admiralty,Position of Russian Black Sea Warships and Merchant Ships givesus great anxiety,20     Merchant Ships.    Important Russian tanker fleet would of course be of greatest value to United Nations but in view of presentsituation over the Second Front it may be inadvisable to press them at this stage to pass their ships out into the Mediterranean.    we hope, however, that  they will at any rate send their Merchant Shipsgood time there to await the outcome of the admiral Miles may inform them that, should theyto pass any of their ships into the Mediterraneanwaters we shall of course be glad to make arrangements on similar lines to those of last autumn and to give themevery assistance in our power.to Turkish ports inCaucasian fighting,subsequently desire for use in NorthernTurks have no right whatever to interfere with passage of merchant ships through the Straits but Admiral Kelly has reported that they mayopen fire on tankers that approach the Bosphoros without firstremoving their defensive armament.      This attitude is intelligible forFleet oilers but in the past Turks have always permitted genuineMerchant Ships to retain defensive equipment.      Since retention of.) defensive armament is essential for passage through the Aegean,this be decided upon,the right of MerchantAdmiral Kelly is requested to ships to retain it.represent to Turks4,     Russians could be reminded how greatly the operations of last yearIwere facilitated by the discharge of oil at Istanbul for the Turks,-jPromise of similar transfer of oil might have important effect onJTurkish attitude particularly in the case  of oilers of doubtful status.5&quot; &quot;      ps have no legal right to pass through the Straits andlAdmiral Kelly reports that they will not be allowed to proceed evenjas far as the Sea of Marmara for internment without first going *9iSregli to be disarmed and to p^.ck up Turkish Naval escort.      HostilitiesIbetween Turkey and Russian Black Sea Fleet may have incalculableconsequences and in view of Turkish attitude chance of successfulpassage of both Straits and dangerous waters of Aegean by surfacewarships is considered very slight.      If the Russian Fleet is deprived of its bases the best therefore we can hope for seems to be internment[Until the military situation takes a more favourable turn,      There,may on the other hand be a possibility of some of the submarinesNeaping clandestinely through the Straits in which case the less we[know about it beforehand the better.We are anxious, however, to know Russian reactions toollowing suggestion.
