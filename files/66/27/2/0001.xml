Operational Achievements.Wilhelmshaven.   (8th/9th July.)The attack on Wilhelmshaven was directed specifically against the submarinebuilding yards on the west side of the Bauhafen, where eleven 500-ton submarinesare now under construction or fitting out.Although there was no moon, a large number of crews identified the targetand night photos show two substantial fires one in the target area and the otherjust north of it in the heart of the city. A specimen night photo is attached, onwhich the Bauhafen is drawn in as it is completely obliterated by fire tracks.Large clouds of smoke are seen blowing away from this fire.&quot;The .full extent of the damage is not yet known. A photo reconnaissance aircraft, however, which was returning at high altitude from another task, saw the harbour through a gap in the clouds and took a &quot; strip&quot; with a 14-inch lenscamera. Although such prints are of too small scale for proper assessment, andthese were of poor quality, they revealed very extensive destruction on both thewest and east sides of the Bauhafen.The big armour plate shop and four other buildings in the submarine buildingyards have been gutted and on the East side of the Bauhafen six or seven large buildings, probably ships&apos; stores and workshops, have also been gutted. On theNorth side of the Tirpitzhafen the engineering works and the smithery have been severely damaged.This is by no means the sum total of the recent damage at Wilhelmshaven.Only a small area of the harbour has been covered by photos, and it is known thatat least one large fire was burning in the town North of the Bailhafen before&apos;e ourCD Oaircraft left.Danzig.   (11th July.)Submarine building yards and slips at Danzig were the target for44 Lancasters, which were due to attack just before nightfall. The flight of 1,700miles was aided by cloud cover all along the route except in the target area, wherethundery conditions prevailed.Attacks were delivered from very low altitudes. Dusk prevented photosbeing taken and, owing to weather conditions, it has not yet been possible to takedamage assessment photographs. Reports show that 22 aircraft bombed the target and that four others bombed the town. A German broadcast of the12th July admitted damage to &quot; military objectives &quot; as well as to the town.Twenty-nine 500-ton submarines are under construction or fitting out atDanzig, making this yard of equal importance with Bremen.Flensburg.   (11th July.)While the Lancasters were on their way to Danzig six Mosquitos attacked the submarine-building yard at Flensburg as a feint to draw attention away fromthe Lancasters. Two crews claim direct hits on the slips and columns of smokewere seen as they left the target.Duisburg.   (13th-14th July.)Weather conditions over the target were difficult. Cloud covered the areaalmost completely, with severe icing conditions and&apos; electrical storms. Mostaircraft bombed on navigational aid. A German broadcast on the 14th Julyadmitted damage and casualties &quot; mainly in the residential areas of Duisburg.&quot;lubeck .   (16th July.)Twenty-one Stirlings left to make a dusk attack on the Flenderwerkesubmarine building yard 5 miles north-east of lubeck . In spite of difficultweather conditions and severe interference by enemy fighters on the outwardjourney, eight aircraft succeeded in finding and bombing the target. Direct hits were seen on the slipways and in the dock area. &apos; Flensburg was also attacked bysome of the remaining aircraft. Several combats took place in a gap in the cloudsover Denmark on the outward journey, as a result of which two enemy fighters were probably destroyed and a third was damaged.  Our losses were two Stirlings.
Information regarding Previous Raids.Industrial Damage in France.During the three attacks on the Gnome-Rhone and Goodrich factories atGennevilliers, the last of which was carried out on the 29th /30th May, it was known that some fires were started outside the area of the target. Recent photoshave now revealed very severe damage in a highly industrialised area 1 mile south-west of this target. In this area, which is roughly 1 mile by ^ mile, many important factories have been hit.The major part of Lorraine Dietrich, which, since the occupation, has beenproducing the German B.M.W. aero engine, has been completely demolished. Anannotated photo of this works is attached, on which the dotted white linesindicate areas in which destruction has been complete.Nouvelle Gallia (wire drawing and metal rolling) and a telephone cable works have been as severely damaged as Lorraine Dietrich, while thirteen other factories,foundries and mills have suffered in varying degrees.This success, together with the substantial damage achieved in the Gnome-Rhone factory and the Gennevilliers power stations, must have been a severe blow to German-controlled French industry.Cologne.An interesting sidelight on the effect of the Cologne raid is thrown by thefollowing extract from a diary found on the body of a German soldier killed inRussia :  &quot;Last mail made an overwhelming impression. On everybody&apos;s lipsare the words &apos; Koln &apos; and &apos; Essen.&apos; Relatives write terrible things.Friedrich was informed that &apos; life had come off the rails &apos; and people simplycannot recover after this di&apos;eadful disaster.&quot;Bremen.The Bremer Nachrichten of 28th June contains the following announcementconcerning an area of approximately 950 acres in Bremen, which consists mainly of workers&apos; dwellings and allotments : &apos;&apos; The Commissioner of Police announces that the wdiole of the followingarea is blocked : Stadtwerder from the Wasserwerk, Piepe, Buntentorsteichand Hickelriede to Weserwehr. In several places phosj^horous rubberincendiaries were found from the last raid, some having exploded. It isforbidden to fetch or eat vegetables, fruit and flowers from there. The whole area will be combed and decontaminated on 28th June by a decontaminationsquad. When gardens in this area are declared safe, it will immediately be announced in the newspapers. Allotment holders who keep small animalsthere may visit the area at their own risk.&quot;Anti-Submarine Patrols.Bomber Command aircraft are now being made available to carry outanti-submarine patrols. In future it is intended, as soon as the necessaryalterations have been made to the aircraft, that a detachment of long-rangeWhitleys from Bomber O.T.U&apos;s, sufficient to give from 30-50 sorties per week,will be maintained at a South-Western aerodrome. These will be manned byO.T.U. crews Hearing the conclusion of their training and they will each do fromone to three long-distance patrols in the Bay of Biscay as the final passing-outtests of their training before proceeding to a Bomber Squadron. In the interima Squadron of Lancasters has been working from a South-Western aerodrome,commencing on the 17th July. On that date one of these aircraft found and sank an enemy submarine which is reported to have been previously damaged by a Coastal Command Whitley. Photographs show a number of the crewswimming in the water after the submarine had sunk.Harassing Raids.With night operations so restricted by weather, aircraft have been employedin small numbers to carry out harassing raids over Germany by day,, making use[24161] &apos; . &apos; &apos;     b 2
of cloud cover, and bombing blind with navigational aids if cloud obscures the target. Such raids, apart from possible material damage, have a good nuisancevalue in industrial areas by causing air raid alarms and stopping work.Mining.According to a Swedish broadcast of the 9th July, the wreck of a minedGerman auxiliary was drifting, waterlogged, off Hevringer. South of AalborgBay.Traffic in the Sound was suspended for 24 hours on the 30th June andfor 18 hours on the 4th July as a result of our sea mining activities.The Norwegian ship Taiwan, of 5.500 tons, was mined and damaged nearBorkum on 14th July.   She was towed into Emden.German Morale.The following account has been received from a reliable informant who hasvisited Cologne: ;&apos; The devastation is absolutely indescribable. To my own knowledge16 works were either entirely or almost entirely demolished,, including therailway workshop. In addition a large number of banks and insurancebuildings have disappeared.The old part of the city suffered most. Hundreds of houses have been destroyed and hundreds more have been pulled down by the Germans asthey were beyond repair and constituted danger. 140.000 people wereofficially evacuated, but the exact number of dead I was unable to ascertain.They were buried in communal graves and the number is stated to be about10,000.The population is very bitter, especially against the Party, whom itaccuses of not paying sufficient attention to the protection of the town, forshortly before the attack a large proportion of the Flak had been moved fromCologne to the Eastern Front. To-day in Cologne the Party uniform hasthe same effect on the population as a red rag on a bull. The resentment of&quot;the inhabitants was still further increased by the fact that neither Hitlernor Goring nor Goebbels came to the funeral of the victims but only the&apos; boozer &apos; Ley. There is a general feeling that under such circumstances thewar cannot last much longer and, further, such mass attacks would cause the whole structure to collapse.&quot;A. H. M.
