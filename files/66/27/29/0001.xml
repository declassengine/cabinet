(42) 212 (O) of the 25thJuly, 1942) General de Gaulle urged (1) The concentration in Great Britain of all available Fighting french forces for participation in operations in the west;(2) that adequate material for sabotage and intelligence work in france should immediately be placed at the disposal of the Fighting french high Command;(3) that arms and equipment for the reconstituted French forces in liberated territory should be stocked in advance and when necessaryplaced at the disposal of the Fighting High Command;(4) that the Fighting French High Command, as part of the inter-allied high Command, should, be associated with the plans and decisions regarding operations in the west.2. At their meeting on the 28th July the Chiefs of Staff recommendedthat the reply to General de Gaulle&apos;s letter should be on the following lines : (1) It was undesirable that Fighting French Forces should be brought tothis country from the Middle East and Free French Africa;(2) that the question of sabotage was already being dealt with by S.O.E.General de Gaulle had. recently been invited, in a letter from theC.I.G.S., to-collaborate with S.O.E. in these matters.(3) arms and equipment would be collected when there was need for it.and arrangements made for its distribution in due course;(4) for reasons of security it would be undesirable that the fighting french High Command should be associated at an early stage withthe planning for major operations.3. There are a number of political considerations which should be takeninto account before a reply is sent to General de Gaulle&apos;s letter, and I wish totake this opportunity of raising the general question of our collaboration withGeneral de Gaulle in matters connected with the preparation of possibleoperations in Metropolitan France.11822   [24214]
4.   The problem may be considered under three heads :-(i) The question whether General de Gaulle should participate in major operations in Metropolitan France, and if so, at what stage heshould be brought into consultation in regard to them;(ii) the  extent  to  which  General  de jGaulle  should  control  (a)  theorganisation of action in France in preparation - for such operations; (&amp;) the conduct of subversive operations; (c) thecollection of intelligence;(iii) the extent to which General de Gaulle should now be  consultedbeforehand as regards the administrative problems that will arise in French territory liberated by Allied operations.5. In examining these questions, the following political considerations are relevant: By the Agreement between the Prime Minister and General de Gaulleof the 7th August, 1940, the General was authorised to raise a french force composed of volunteers which would be organised and employed againstthe common enemies. In view of this declared object, a refusal on our part to allow Free French Forces to participate in major operations in Metro--,politan France would be a reversal of His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy towards General de Gaulle during the last two years. Further, HisMajesty&apos;s Government have recently recognised&apos; La France Combattante asa symbol of the resistance to the Axis of all French nationals who do not accept the capitulation, and who, by the means at their disposal, contribute,wherever they are, to the liberation of France by the common victory of theUnited Nations. The chief organisations of resistance in France seem to belooking to General de Gaulle as their leader. We have, at the GeneraTsrequest, brought over from France representatives of these organisations to.join-the National Committee in London; and it is our policy to encouragethis collaboration between the General and the resistance movements inFrance. It is also, I think, part of our military plan that these organisationsshould be used for sabotage and for promoting a rising in France at theproper moment in support of our operations. In occupied France, thepopulation of which is 28 million, as against 12 million in unoccupied France,the spirit of French resistance is at its highest. There is ground for believing that General de Gaulle&apos;s standing with the population of occupied Franceis such that they will expect him to play his part, and would find it difficultto understand the arrival of British or American forces without theirFighting French Allies. It may be argued that General de Gaulle&apos;s arrival in France would destroy any hope there may be of bringing the Vichy Govern-ment over to our side. It is, however, very questionable whether the presentViclry Government would be acceptable to the forces of resistance in france as the Government under which France itself would come back into the war.6. France is, however, in an explosive state and no one can foresee in whatprecise direction the reaction would come when the moment arrives to touch offthe forces of resistance, simultaneously with the arrival of the Allied forces.Meanwhile, the one authority within our reach with which we can work is general de-Gaulle. He is, quite rightly in our view, developing his contacts with the organisations of resistance in France, and adding representatives of these organisations to his National Committee. We are doing our best to bring overto this country those whose names he indicates to us. At the outset, at any rate,General de Gaulle would probably, be the predominant French authority in metropolitan French territory liberated by the action of the Allied forces. Hewould, indeed, probably be put forward as such by the leader of the resistancemovements, perhaps as President of an interim Administration. The extent towhich&apos;he would, after this initial stage, extend his authority as the liberated areagrew cannot be foreseen. Much would depend upon the attitude of the french people towards him and the attitude of such other French authorities, military or other, as might have emerged meanwhile in other parts of the country. Butwe should, it is suggested, count on his having some authority in liberatedterritory at the outset. There would thus, I suggest, be advantage in discussing with him in advance the administrative problems that would arise in liberatedterritory.
7. The conclusions that suggest themselves as regards the three main questions put in paragraph 4 above are as follows : (i) General cle Gaulle? &amp; participation in major operations, and our consultation-with him.8. There are strong political grounds for allowing General de Gaulle toparticipate in major operations undertaken in Metropolitan France. It is realised that for reasons of security it may be difficult to associate the general at an early stage with the planning of such operations. But it would help tomaintain good relations with him if the military problems raised by possibleoperations in France could be discussed with him on a hypothetical basis, without reference to any particular plan. He is justified in expecting to be consulted,and his advice should be of value. Once a plan had been adopted, he should bebrought into detailed consultation as soon as security considerations allowed.(ii) General de Gaulle&apos;&apos;s control of special operations and intelligenceorganisations.9. There is a conflict of principle between General de Gaulle and our ownauthorities in this question. General de Gaulle has for some time been pressing for the means to set up an organisation of his own for this purpose, to be inclepen-dent of the British services. He has now put his case exhaustively in a-memorandum left at the Foreign Office on the 4th August, 1942, in which heasks that the co-ordination of preparatory action in France with the strategicAllied plans should be transferred from the British secret services to the allied high Command charged with the operations, and that he himself should be insupreme command of the internal French front, receiving directions of generalstrategy from the Allied High Command. Copies of this latest memorandumhave been sent to the services concerned.10. The view of our services is that, while willing to collaborate withGeneral de Gaulle in such preparatory work in France, they are opposed to theestablishment of an independent Free French organisation working without their knowledge, and that, in addition, they must maintain their own organisationsworking independently of General de Gaulle. We must expect General de Gaulleto press his view very strongly. I would suggest that, in view of the growingintimacy of the relations between General de Gaulle&apos;s headquarters in Londonand the resistance movements in France, our policy in regard to the organisationof secret -preparatory action in France should now be re-examined in the light ofthe arguments put forward in General de Gaulle&apos;s latest memorandum. TheDepartments and organisations concerned are the Chiefs of Staff, S.O.E., S.I.S.,and the Foreign Office.(iii) Considtation with General de Gaulle as regards administrative problems in liberated territory.11. The problems that will arise in connexion with the civilian administra-tion in liberated territories in Europe are being studied by the Administration of territories (Europe) Committee of the War Office, on which the Foreign Officeand the United States Army are represented. This Committee has agreed thatthe Allied Governments and General de Gaulle should be consulted on administra-tive problems likely to arise when planning in principle future operations onthe continent, if and when consultation had been approved by the Foreign Officeand the Chiefs of Staff. As regards one of these problems, namely, the form of martial law which would have to be introduced, the General Staff have informed the Committee that, provided there is no discussion of the operational aspects of future operations, there is no objection to such discussions, and that there are many advantages from the administrative point of view. The General Staff ruled,however, that the Fighting French, as distinct from the Allied Governments,should at this stage be left out of any such discussions. Since it would be difficultto start discussions with the Belgian and Netherlands Governments without theFighting French hearing of it and asking for similar treatment, it was decided
by the Committee that no consultation either with the Allied Governments or with General de Gaulle on the problem of the maintenance of law and order shouldtake place for the time being.12. In view of the political considerations advanced above, there is a case for bringing General de Gaulle into such discussions at the same time as theAllied Governments. It is true that, as the French National Committee is nota recognised Government, discussions with the National Committee would becarried on on a different basis from those with the Allied Governments. But ifthe Fighting French Forces are to take part in major operations in France, andif, as is suggested above, General de Gaulle&apos;s relations with the organisations of resistance in France are such as to make it desirable that his collaboration withthem should be supported by His Majesty&apos;s Government, it is to be expected thathe will be called upon by these organisations to play some role in the administra-tion of liberated territory. It would therefore be desirable that theseadministrative questions should be discussed with him in advance of operations,so far as this can be done without bringing in the operational aspect.A.
