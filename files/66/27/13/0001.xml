DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)COPY No.3) 555mist 1942 , -;WAR CABINETLIQUOR POLICY IN WEST africa memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.1.      The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regardto the sale of liquor to Africans in West Africa is governed &quot;bythe St.  Germain Liquor Traffic Convention of the 10th September,1919.2.      Laws have been passed in the West African Colonies &quot; &apos;.which are intended to give effect to the Convention and theselaws permit the importation of spirits into West Africa subjectto certain conditions imposed for the purpose of preventing thesale of unduly cheap or of injurious liquor.5.      Before the war practically all the geneva (a tradeterm for gin manufactured in a pot still) and a certain amountof gin, which&apos; for practical purposes are the only spirits which,need to be considered,  came from Holland or other parts of theContinent.    A fair amount of   gin was imported from this countrybut the greater portion of this consisted of the more expensivebrands which are consumed by Europeans.    Following&apos; the conquestof Europe by Germany, the supply of continental gin was cut offcompletely,- and for supply reasons restrictions have been placed upon the amount of gin which might be exported from this country the result is that West Africa and in particular the Gold Coast,where the - inhabitants are the main consumers of gin and Geneva in West Africa, has been suffering from a serious shortage ofgin during the past year&apos;and more, and this appears to have ledto a deplorable increase in illicit distillation in theGold Coast.4.      In order to meet this situation the West AfricanGovernors&apos; Conference in February last suggested the local,production of potable spirits.    Tho idea was that suchmanufacture might be expected to replace to some extent,illicitly distilled spirits by reputable liquor distilled underproper Government control.5.      I should have had no hesitation in accepting thissuggestion but for one difficulty.      Article 5 of the Conventionexpressly forbids the manufacture of &quot;distilled beverages in an area which includes&apos; West&apos;Africa.    For this and other obvious reasons attempts have been made to check illicit distillationin the Gold Coast.    But these have proved ineffective and I am satisfied that therelis no hope of repressive measures havingeven a moderate success unless the police force could beincreased to an extent which would be quite impracticable Inpresent circumstances.6.      On the other hand it seems clear from the preamble to the Convention that the prohibition of local distillation was provided for to enable the restrictions placed on, importationto be effective, and in the present exceptional circumstances -it seems possible to justify distillation in West Africa tinderGovernment

T68Mvernment control as a means of carrying out more effectuallyshe clear intention of the Convention.    That intention was notto prevent altogether the consumption of spirits by the Africanpopulation, hut to ensure that spirits, the importation oftfiich is permitted,  arc of good quality   nd not unduly cheap.7.      I therefore recommend to my colleagues that in viev/of the special considerations explained above, the local[distillation of spirits in West Africa under strict government control should be approved in principle and that it shouldIbe loft to me. to consult with the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs as to the best means of giving effect to thisdecision having regard to the provisions&apos; of the Liquor Traffic[convention.8.      In recommending this departure from the strict letterof the Convention, I have not lost sight of the probability that such action may be severely criticised in temperancecircles and that it may be misrepresented as involving a[disregard of the sanctity of treaties as well as of the wellbeing of the African peoples for whom we are responsible.,these objections, however, are outweighed in my opinion by thedesirability of taking the only step v/hich appears practicableJto check the breach of the Convention v/hich is involved in the prevalence of the illicit industry in the Gold Coast,  and toBensure a reasonable supply of good quality spirits for localjconsumption in temporary replacement of part of the normal supply[which has been cut off by the war,Colonial Office.3rd August,  1942.
