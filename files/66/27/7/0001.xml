THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  July 1942.SECRET. CoPy No&apos;J.I.C. (42) 282.July 24, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee.To the Right Hon. C. R. Attlee, M.P.,Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and deputy Prime Minister.JAPANESE OIL.Report by the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee.THE Technical Sub-Committee on Axis Oil, of which Sir Harold Hartleyis chairman, have made a preliminary study of the Japanese oil situation. the salient points of their report are summarised below. To this summary we haveadded the conclusions which, in our opinion, should be drawn from the evidencethat has been accumulated.1. Japan will have no difficulty in meeting her requirements of aviation spirit, motor spirit, kerosene or lubricants. She may, however, have difficulty(a) in producing enough diesel and fuel oil (for use as ships&apos; bunkers, stationaryengines, boiler fuel, &amp;c), and (b) in transporting these products from production to consumption areas.2. Under war conditions, and assuming that consumption by the Japanesenavy and mercantile marine is comparable with consumption by our own navy and mercantile marine operating under war conditions (with a slight bias infavour of&apos;the Japanese on account of their more favourable position in regardto convoys), the present estimated rate of consumption by Japan and the occupied territories is 5,300,000 tons of diesel and fuel oil out of a total consumption ofabout 7 million tons of all products.3. Production within the Japanese Empire is small (i.e., from Japanese,Formosan and Sakhalin crudes, Manchurian shale oil and synthetic plants) and provides only about 900,000 tons of diesel and fuel oil.4. There is thus, without taking into account production from capturedoilfields, an excess of consumption of diesel and fuel oil over production of some4,400,000 tons.5. The oilfields in the East Indian Archipelago produce for the most partlight crude oils containing a high percentage of gasoline and a comparativelylow percentage of diesel and fuel oil.6.   In order to obtain 4,400,000 tons of fuel and diesel oil from these oilfields,which were extensively sabotaged, they must be developed to produce about[24144]
9 million tons of crude, which is slightly in excess of the annual rate of production-tion prior to the Japanese occupation. Although the Royal Dutch Companybelieve that it is possible to reach this rate of development by &quot;the end of July 1942,they point out that a very considerable engineering feat is involved.7. Before this stage of development has been reached consumption will exceed intake, and will result over the first seven months in 1942 in a withdrawalof about If million tons from the stocks of diesel and fuel oil with which Japanentered the war.8. A number of different estimates have been made of Japanese oil stocks at the 1st January, 1942. The Hartley Committee have assumed a figure of6^ million tons, of which about 3 million tons consisted of diesel and fuel oil.*9. Excess of consumption over production during the first seven months of1942 will result in these stocks being reduced to about 1 - 3 million tons by the endof July 1942.10/ iilthough from August 1942, onwards, the excess of production overconsumption provides an apparent solution to Japanese oil difficulties, it mustbe remembered that the bulk of diesel and fuel oil consumption takes place in japan proper, while the bulk of the production takes place in the East IndianArchipelago.11. The Japanese tanker fleet, though modern, is not large. After makingallowance for sinkings up to the 1st June, 1942, and ships under repair, and assuming that 250,000 tons (g.r.t.) of tankers are required for operations withthe fleet (after allowing for the differences in size between the British and japanese fleet, this is rather lower than British requirements), the balance avail-able is only just sufficient to transport from the East Indies the quantitiesrequired for actual consumption.12. Thus, on the basis of Japans present naval dispositions it will beimpossible to increase stocks of diesel and fuel oil in Japan, in spite of the gradual increase in production in the Netherlands East Indies.Conclusions.1. The sinking of enemy tankers is likely to result i.n a further contractionof stocks of fuel and diesel oil in Japan proper.2. Although, according to the Royal Dutch Shell, the exploitationprogramme necessary to make Japan self-sufficient in fuel and diesel oil mightbe completed by the end of this month, the engineering problems involved are so considerable that the programme may well be delayed by two or three months.Any action that can be taken, therefore, during say the next three months,to interfere with Japanese development will, to the extent that it succeeds inretarding production, result in a further decline of fuel and diesel oil stocks in Japan.Notes At annexes A and B are graphs illustrating the trend of the stock position of Japanese diesel and fuel oil and showing how error in estimating the rate at which the Netherlands East Indies production of these productswould be reflected in a greater or less degree of stringency in the Japaneseposition. Annex C is a note on the Japanese oil tanker position in amplificationof paragraphs 11 and 12 above.V. CAVENDISH-B ENTINCK.J. H. GODFREY.F. H. N. DAVIDSON.C. E. H. MEDHURST.C. G. VICKERS.Great George Street, .S.W. 1.July 24, 1942.* The stock figure referred to in paragraph 8 above has been used to illustrate the trend inthe Japanese oil position, and should not be taken as an agreed basis for an accurate statisticalanalysis.   A further investigation into the Japanese oil stocks is being undertaken.










ANNEX C.Japanese Tanker Position.THE mercantile and naval tanker tonnage available to Japan at the1st June, 1942, after allowing for new construction and sinkings up to thatdate, amounted to about 700,000 gross register tons. The tonnage permanentlyattached to the navy is about 250,000 tons, and out of the 450,000 tons leftallowance has to be made for 10 per cent, under repairs and 1\ per cent,bunkering capacity, so that the net capacity available for general movementof oil is only about 360,000 tons.2. In calculating the allocation of tonnage to meet essential consumptionit has been assumed that out of 3-3 million tons of fuel oil required by theJapanese fleet in a year 2 million tons are used in Japan, 600,000 in Singapore,and 700,000 in the Mandatory Islands.3. During the second six months of 1942, about 248,000 tons capacity willbe required :  (a) For shipment of white oils from Japan to China and from netherlands east Indies to China, the Philippines, Malaya, &amp;c. (18,000 capacity).(b) For shipment of black oils from Netherlands East Indies for navy fuel to malaya and the Mandatory Islands and some 870,000 tons of crude to japan which cannot be absorbed by the makeshift refining methodsassumed in the Netherlands East Indies (230,000 tons).(c) The unallotted balance available to ship fuel oil from Netherlands east indies to keep up stocks from Japan will be 115,000 only, orapproximately 12 average-sized tankers.id) Black oil stocks in Japan will fall steadily from about 3 million tons at the beginning to the dangerous level of only about half a million at the end of the year. These stocks must therefore be kept up byshipments from Netherlands East Indies, which might amount to700,000 tons by using all the unallotted tanker tonnage.(e) In 1943, assuming that general consumption and the main fleetdispositions are unchanged and tankers are maintained at the samefigure by new acquisitions, all the surplus tanker tonnage will haveto be allotted to fuel and diesel oil shipments to Japan to keep herstock position at a reasonable level. Delays in the &quot; Exploitationprogramme&quot; assumed for the Netherlands East Indies or shortageof refinery facilities in the Netherlands East Indies may make .itnecessary to ship more crude oil to Japan, at the expense of the fuel oil position. Thus any increased production in the netherlands east Indies in 1943 will not alleviate the black oil shortage in Japanunless there are further economies or the fleet can be stationed closer to the main source of supply.4. On the above showing, the tanker position as a whole reveals elements of weakness and vulnerability.
