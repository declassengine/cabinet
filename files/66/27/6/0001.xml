THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1942.Copy No.   1 8TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.PROVISION OF AIRCRAFT FOR THE WAR AT SEA.Memorandum by the Accredited Representative of the Government of theCommonwealth of Australia.THE Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee W.P. (42) 302 appears to meto be a mos,t unsatisfactory and illogical document. It has all the appearance of a compromise between sharply divergent points of view. It is difficult to under-stand how the Chiefs of Staff accepted the compromise in face of the sombrepicture they themselves draw in paragraph 4 of their report.2. The Report was based on the strategy contained in Memorandum W.W. 1,which is interpreted as requiring our commitments to be met in the followingorder of priority (a) Minimum necessary fighter defence for the United Kingdom.(6) Minimum necessary allocation for securing our vital communications and interrupting those of the enemy,(c) Maximum possible provision for the offensive both direct and in supportof land operations.3. With this order of priority provision for the offensive, both direct and indirect, in so far as it is not for the purpose of ensuring our vital communications and interrupting those of the enemy must be subordinated to this primaryobjective. This means that the requirements of Bomber Command for the offensive on Germany must be regarded as subsidiary to the protection of our sea communications.4. With this background, which is set out in their paper, the Chiefs ofStaff make their report and submit their recommendations. A careful study ofthe report and recommendations, however, shows that the Chiefs of Staff havenot followed the priorities laid down, but make additional action for the defenceof sea communications subsidiary to the requirements of Bomber Command.5. There are many examples in respect to all the areas dealt with in theChiefs of Staff report. The following are a few of them, which I give to illustratemy point.In the Home area the report states : &quot; The primary and immediate need is for an increased number of long-range aircraft for anti-submarine patrols in the home area, particularly the bay of Biscay, as well as, for. reconnaissance aircraft for work with theHome Fleet and to impose our blockade measures.&quot;[24171] BMOST SECRET /W.P. (42) 326. 1/Julv 31. 1942.
As this need is for the purpose of &quot; securing our vital communications andinterrupting those of the enemy&quot; it is a first priority. The method proposed for meeting it, however, does not accord such priority. It contemplatesproviding a certain number of Lancasters. This, however, in the words of Jhereport &quot;would be done in general at the expense of the mining effort.&quot; Themining effort is similar in purpose to that for which the Lancasters would bemade available to Coastal Command. This really means the robbing of Peterto pay Paul. Further &quot; the number of aircraft available each week for anti-submarine patrols from these two sources (i.e., Operational Training Units andBomber Command) will fluctuate according to the incidents of Operational UnitTraining Courses and the necessity for concentrating all available aircraftwhen very large-scale raids are to be made on Germany.&quot; This means that the availability of aircraft for &quot; securing our vital communications and interruptingthose of the enemy &quot; is dependent upon the requirements of Operational training units and Bomber Command.This can hardly be said to be in accordance with the priorities laid down.6. As a result of the proposals contained in the Chiefs of Staff reportthe hope is expressed that it may be possible &quot; to work up to a maximum of fifty sorties a week.&quot; Can this possibly be regarded as a serious attempt tograpple with what is probably the most serious menace with which we haveever been faced?7. In dealing with the Indian Ocean area the Chiefs of Staff &apos;&apos; recognise the importance of meeting the requirements for reconnaissance and striking force in the Indian Ocean as soon as possible, as on this will depend our ability to transfer the Eastern Fleet to the Pacific or elsewhere.&quot; Nothing could bemore important &quot; for securing our vital communications and interrupting thoseof the enemy&quot; in these waters than such transfer. Nevertheless the Chiefs ofStaff do&apos; not propose to start sending long-range reconnaissance aircraft to ceylon until October.The reason for this delay appears to be a reluctance to permit even atemporary weakening of Bomber Command. It seems that the requirementsof Coastal Command for long-range general reconnaissance aircraft will not be fully supplied until October, and that its immediate needs will be met fromtime to time by drawing on Bomber Command. When Coastal Command&apos;s ownaircraft eventually become available those borrowed from Bomber Command willhave been returned the latter Command thus remaining undepleted. At thisstage the needs of the Indian Ocean area commence to be met but, I suggest,this is a complete reversal of the priorities upon which the Chiefs of Staff saythey are working in preparing their report.8. While others could be given, the above examples are sufficient to illustratemy contention that the Chiefs of Staff in their conclusions and recommendations are in conflict with priorities they set out at the beginning of their paper asthose under which they are working.9. The inconsistencies I have referred to are probably due either to one orthe other of two causes. These are that the Chiefs of Staff Committee beingcomposed of men representative of different Services only found it possible to overcome their different points of view by compromise, or that the government policy was not in accordance with the priorities which they had laid down ininterpretation of Memorandum W.W. 1.10. Whatever the cause, I suggest that the proper approach to a solution would be for Cabinet formally to adopt those priorities and to direct that a fur-ther report be submitted in accordance with them. Such report should set outthe whole problem and give all the necessary information and facts which theWar Cabinet will require in order to arrive at its decision; it should also show,without regard to the effect upon our air offensive in other directions, what wouldbe necessary to safeguard our sea communications and how rapidly those measures could be carried out.11. Having that picture, before us we can then consider the effect the taking of such action would have upon our offensive power, e.g., bombing Germany.For example, if our present plans contemplate bombing sorties on Germany onthe scale of 1,500 a week, rising to 2.500 a week over the next few months, with an
increasing number of full-scale attacks of 1,000 planes and over, to what extentwould these estimates be diminished if priority were given to the ascertainedair requirements for securing our sea communications ?12. My own impression is that, while the scale of our offensive may possibly be reduced over the next few months and the point when we would reach ourmaximum effort be delayed to a certain extent, the reduction and delay would notbe such as seriously to imperil the effectiveness of our efforts.13. Until we have all the facts before us, however, it is impossible to-determine what our policy should be. With the facts before us we can decide between the relative claims of the security of our sea routes and the offensive against Germany, and determine, our policy so as to achieve the best results.14. I also suggest that the question of the security of sea communications isof such importance to all the United Nations that having cleared our own mindsand adjusted our own dispositions we should then approach the United States ofAmerica with the view to laying down a common policy to be implemented by acommon effort.15. I attach as an Annex a Note* which I forwarded to the Prime minister on the 16th June dealing with some aspects of this problem.S. M. B.July 30, 1942.* This note was circulated on the 16th June, 1942, as C.O.S. (42) 172 (O).[24171]
ANNEX.Air against the Sea.AS I understand the position, our basic policy in regard to the contribution of the air towards the defeat of Germany is the creation of an overwhelmingBomber Force. In pursuance of this policy our resources for the production of offensive types of aircraft, i.e., Bombers, have been directed towards creatingthis overwhelming strength, particularly in the largest and heaviest types of machine.2. In my view, however, important as this objective is and resolutely asit must be pursued, it is vital side by side with it to provide for effective air action against the sea.3. Our victory in this war, as in previous wars, depends upon the controlof the Sea. In the past this has been maintained by naval strength primarily in surface craft. In the 1914-18 war it was menaced by the Submarine, but suchmenace was countered.4. In the present war the control of the seas by surface craft is not merelybeing menaced, but there is progressively being substituted for it control by surface craft plus aircraft operating in narrow waters from the land and aircraft carriers and in the wide oceans from carriers.5. It is established that surface craft, even modern armoured warships, arehelpless against superior and efficient air power. In my view naval strength,unless supplemented b)r adequate air support, is a liability rather than an asset.Future naval engagements will not be clashes between great fleets with surfacevessels operating against surface vessels, but will be preceded by combats betweencarrier-borne aircraft. Following these combats the surface vessels of the victorwill have the opportunity of destroying the crippled or disabled battleships orcruisers of its opponents.6. While this position is being increasingly realised, I venture the opinionthat sufficient drive and imagination is not being shown in taking the necessary steps to meet it. There appears to me to be too great a tendency to think interms of the concentration of superior naval forces rather than to realise that even inferior naval forces can command the situation if supported by superiorcarrier-borne Air Forces reinforced, where circumstances permit, by effectiveland-based Air Forces.7. I believe our policy should be to avoid any major naval engagement until we have built up our air strength against the sea to one of overwhelmingsuperiority. In the meantime, we should operate offensively against the enemyby cruiser-cum-aircraft carrier units as suggested in the appreciation of theAustralian Chiefs of Staff of the 19th March. The number of these units couldbe increased as the air support we can provide grows. Progressively, we canexpand our operations by combining units up to the point of endeavouring tobring to action the enemy&apos;s major naval forces.8.   To achieve this objective it will be necessary to provide (a) The maximum number of aeroplane carriers.(b) A carrier-borne fighter superior to that of the enemy.(c) The most effective type of plane and weapon, e.g., Torpedo-carryingplanes.With regard to (a) experience appears to have shown that the heavily-armouredsuper-aeroplane-carrier is a mistake. Our efforts should be directed towards pro-viding the maximum number of carriers, even if they are only converted liners oranything else our wit and ingenuity can devise that would be suitable for thepurpose.With regard to (b) the present position appears to be that our fighters arenot equal to the Japanese. Our efforts must be directed towards obtaining thesame superiority in sea fighters as we have achieved in land fighters.
With regard to (c) the overcoming of our shortage in aerial torpedoes mustbe given an Al priority. Our types, both in size and strength, must be carefully considered. It is a somewhat sad commentary that the &quot; inefficient &quot; JapaneseAir Force can, I understand, launch a torpedo from 400 to 500 feet whereas wehave to come down as low as 150 feet.9. Side by side with the development of the combined naval-air offensivesuggested above we should expand the activities of our long-range aeroplanesagainst the sea from suitable land bases in all parts of the world.10. If this is to be done more thought must be given to the utilisation of our long-range Bomber types for offensive action against the sea. The question of aerodromes with adequate run-ways in all theatres of operations requires urgent consideration.11. Developments in R.D.F., e.g., A.S.V., should enable us to make these activities increasingly effective. In order to achieve the maximum results, how-ever, an appropriate priority will have to be given in our scientific developmentalwork to the offensive against the sea.12. Apart from the case which I have tried to make above it is essentialthat we should keep in mind that it is in the Air we have the potential of creatingan overwhelming superiority to the enemy.13. Our sea strength is greater than that of our enemies, but not markedlyso. Naval construction taking so long, our greater resources and buildingfacilities will not enable us to create a position of overwhelming strength within any reasonable time. It is to my mind over-optimism to think in terms ofgaining such a Naval supremacy in the Pacific and Far East as will bring japan to her knees, and it would be stupid to ignore the possibility of reverses in thoseseas. Our land forces are such that apart from an overwhelming success by russia the best we can look for is to hold our own plus the possibility of China, re-armed and re-equipped from our production, inflicting a serious military reverse on japan.  This latter contingency appears remote at the moment.14. In the air, however, the position is entirely different, in that we havethe resources to enable us to create an overwhelming and decisive strength.15. During 1942 the combined production of the United States of America,the British Empire and Russia may well be twice that of the Axis Powers, andin 1943 four times. This strength properly employed should enable us to defeat the enemy. If we are so to employ it, however, there must be a fundamentalreconsideration of our strategic and production policies.16. Such consideration must, in my view, lead to the creation of new machinery for the direction of our Air policy. At present the primary obligation of advising on Air policy rests with the Air Ministry. This advice is examined by the Chiefs of Staff, and after consideration by them is passed to the WarCabinet. The Air Ministry machine, however, is not designed for constructivethinking. The Chief of the Air Staff is overwhelmed with his work on the Chiefsof Staff Committee, and the Vice-Chief of the Air Staff is constantly preoccupied with detailed duties; the Chiefs of Staff Committee, which reviews the AirMinistry&apos;s recommendations, is over-loaded, and I submit that the War cabinet should not be dependent upon them for advice on this all-important question ofour Air policy.    &apos;17. In view of the paramount importance of this question I would suggest the immediate appointment of a small high-powered Committee (a) To examine how our aerial offensive power against the sea can be strengthened both on a long-term basis and immediately.(b) In this examination any proposals however unorthodox or revolutionaryto be considered.(c) In addition to representatives of the Navy, Air Force and Ministry of aircraft Production the Committee should include the best availableScientists.
(d) The Prime Minister, as Minister of Defence, to preside at the firstmeeting and to appoint a Cabinet Minister not associated with either the Navy or Air Force to preside at subsequent meetings with instructions to drive the examination through as rapidly as possible and to ensure co-operation between all the Members of the Committee.(e) The War Cabinet to give to such of the recommendations arising out ofthe examination as it approves an Al priority, irrespective ofexisting production programme or previously determined policies.18. While no doubt the co-operation of the Army with the work of theCommittee would be desirable, I have not dealt with this point as this note is confined to the question of the Air against the Sea. .19. Co-operation with the United States of America will of course benecessary.  Let us, however, clear our own minds first.S. M. B.June 16, 1942.
