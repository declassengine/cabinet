DORMAN-SMITH has discussed with me the line of approach tothe questions of policy which will arise after our reoccupation of Burma. It isdesirable to look ahead and consider in advance, so far as possible, the principles which should guide us in seeking a solution of these questions and in using the opportunities which will arise for reconstruction and remedying past defects.I invite the attention of the War Cabinet to the attached Memorandum bySir R. Dorman-Smitb. in which his views are clearly and succinctly stated.   the primary  problem which will  face  us will  be  that of  rehabilitation  and reconstruction.   The economic life of the country will have been destroyed bythe Japanese and by tne further ravages which must inevitably occur before itis re-conquered.   Since Burma will have suffered so severely through being a theatre of war in the conflict between the British Empire and Japan, it will,I hope, be agreed in principle that an obligation will rest on the ImperialGovernment to supply generous aid in restoring her to her normal life.Recognition of such an obligation would naturally involve control of the measuresto be taken to implement it, and this will affect every department of theadministration.  For this, and the other reasons given by the Governor, it would follow that, during the reconstruction period, it will be necessary to resort to asystem of direct rule.    Sir Reginald believes that, if financial assistance wereforthcoming on a generous scale, responsible Burmese opinion would acquiesce in such an arrangement as a temporary provision necessary for reconstruction and the restoration to Burma of her capacity for self-government and the more readily if, as he proposes, it were associated in the task through advisory bodies.But it would be desirable that a time-limit should be laid down for the provisionalregime, and that we should let it be known in general terms that it is our intentionto consult with representative Burmans towards the end of the period as to thebest means of establishing full self-government (subject to any safeguards whichmay then be found necessary).   The exact scope and form of a general statementof this nature would, of course, require careful consideration, and a furthersubmission on this would be made to the War Cabinet in due course.The Governors suggestions, in which I fully concur, are summarised inparagraph 7 of his Memorandum. In view of the size.and complexity of theadministrative and other problems which will have to be taken in hand afterreoccupation, it is desirable to use to the full whatever interval we have forstudying plans and preparations, but in order that work on these may be effectiveit is necessary that a decision in principle should be taken as to the main linesof approach. It is for this reason that we are submitting these suggestions at[24196] .
2this stage. Sir Reginald is anxious to be able to start the detailed work of planning ahead as soon as he gets back to India. He contemplates leaving by air about the middle of August.I have spoken above of the assistance to be given as &quot; financial.&quot; In fact,the assistance Burma will require will consist partly of the capital goods (railway material, river steamers, mining machinery, &amp;c.) necessary to recreate the workingplant of the country, partly of consumers&apos; goods. The supply of both of these categories by British industry may be a very valuable contribution to theemployment problem here after the war. On the other hand, it is difficult tosee how we can provide sterling for reconstruction in Burma or elsewhere if itis to be spent on either capital or consumers&apos; goods imported from other countries.Sir R. Dorman-Smith&apos;s proposals, therefore, raise the whole question of reconstruction and regeneration in the Empire in its bearing both on immediate post-war employment and on the development of markets and sources of supply for the future.L. S. A.Burma Office, August 7. 1942.Memorandum by the Governor of Burma, (to the Secretary of State for Burma).1. When the Japanese are evicted from Burma we will be faced withurgent problems of reconstruction both physical, economic and political. I would welcome your guidance as to the line of approach to be ^adopted.2.   Present and Future Condition of Burma.(1) A. Military operations and our &quot; scorched-earth &quot; policy have practically devastated urban and industrial Burma.B. We did what we could to ruin our system of communications by thedestruction of bridges, rolling stock and inland water transport.C. Health services, &amp;c, which so largely depended on European and Indianpersonnel, must be in a parlous condition.D. The rural financial structure which unfortunately was built up on theChettyar money-lenders will have collapsed.(2) While we may take it that during their occupation the Japanese will succeed in building some order out of the chaos which we left, we must anticipate that they will destroy everything possible before they are forced out and thatour own bombing and I hope &apos;&apos; left-behind &apos;&apos; parties will prevent the enemyfrom doing much physical reconstruction. Burma may have to face anotherinvasion which may well be even more destructive than the last.(3) Even though the Japanese may succeed in setting up some form of central and district administration with the help of Dr. Ba Maw, our future military operations in Burma will undoubtedly cause their disintegration so thaton our return we will find a state of lawlessness and a complete absence ofGovernment administration.3.   Courses open to us on our Return.(1) Grant immediate &quot; freedom &quot; to Burma and let the Burmese reconstructtheir country as best they can by their own unaided efforts.(2) Revive the 1935 Constitution and carry on from where we left off withthe Council of Ministers and the Legislature in possession of all their pre-warpowers.(3) Suspend the present Constitution for a limited or unlimited time andresort to a system of direct rule through the Governor until reconstruction is complete.4. (1) To wash our hands of Burma seems to me to be out of. the question,if we recognise our responsibility to rehabilitate the life of that country whichhas been destroyed owing to our inability to defend her; The Burmese haveneither the ability nor the financial resources to tackle this formidable taskunaided^
(2)   In my view it would be a mistake to revive the immediate pre-warConstitutional position (a) Although the 1935 Constitution never actually broke down, it creakedvery badly. Either we had gone too far or we had&quot; not gone far enough along the road to &quot;Dominion status.&quot;(b) While I have no reason to complain of any lack of co-operation onthe part of Ministers, it was obvious that they had neither the capacity nor the inclination to work a democratic Government inthe way Parliament intended when it passed the Government of burma Act.(c) The House of Representatives has proved to be of poor quality andit is doubtful whether a general election would produce a bettertype of members. Politics both local and national are hopelesslycorrupt and the electorate ill-educated while Parties are based on no political principle.If this was the position in times of peace how much worse would it be in a confused post-war period, when the work of reconstructionwould provide new and greater opportunities for graft.(d) During the preparations for war and the invasion period itselfdifficulties did arise owing to the division of responsibility betweenthe Governor and his Ministers, who, though not directly responsiblefor defence, had control of many departments vital to defence.Eventually these difficulties were resolyed by Ministers voluntarilysurrendering their power to the Governor. If the 1935 Constitutionwere revived similar difficulties would arise in the work of reconstruction which would undoubtedly render it a slow and painfulprocess.(3) The best course seems to me to be to resort to a system of direct rule forthe period of reconstruction.5.   (A). Advantages of Direct Rule.(1) It is essential that we should avoid re-introducing the abuses ^whichflourished under the old system of government. We shall have an unexampledopportunity to eradicate, old defects e.g., the money lending system, system ofland tenure, the exploitation of &quot;cheap &quot; Indian labour. We can expect fewimportant reforms from Ministers who can easily be bought.(2) If we are successfully to tackle the many sores which irritated the bodypolitic of Burma, delicate negotiations will have to be initiated with the Govern-ment of India. If Burmese Ministers are entrusted with the handling of these negotiations, there would be but little hope of success.- (3) The period of pacification and of re-establishing civil administration ona sounder foundation will be both difficult and dangerous. There are manyfirst-class European officers who are eagerly looking forward to the opportunityto devote their energy and enthusiasm to this task, but NOT if they have to serve under the control of corrupt Burmese politicians. Only under direct rule can we make full use of their proven ability and drive.(4) The big business firms must be encouraged to restart their operationsagain as soon as possible, They will naturally seek some guarantees of security and could hardly be expected, to welcome a return to the measure of control whichwas exercisable by Ministers, who never have shown much business sense.Although I think that we will have to consider what should be the futurerelationship between business firms and the Government of Burma, nevertheless,for the good of Burma the European firms mixst be given every encouragement to get back to work.(5) His Majesty&apos;s Government must inevitably shoulder full financial responsibility for the reconstruction of Burma, unless of course America comes into the picture. This burden will be a heavy one as the amount of money whichwill have to be expended will be very large indeed. It would be sheer follyto entrust the spending of vast sums to Ministers or even to rely upon dividedcontrol between Governor and Ministers.
(B) Disadvantages of Direct Rule.(1) One disadvantage would be that we would be accused of &quot;setting back the clock&apos; in granting &quot;freedom&quot; to our subject races. There would be manyanswers to that charge, but it might be well to consider whether, if His Majesty&apos;sGovernment agree that some period of direct rule is necessary, a time limit mightnot be put upon the period. If, as appears likely, we have the opportunity toconsider our plans in detail, we might be able to draw up a five or a seven years&quot;plan for Burma, after which time we could make good our promise of constitutional advance.(2) We might also be accused of not allowing the Burmese people to take anypart in the reconstruction of their own country. Clearly their help and advicewould be essential, and I would propose that the Governor should appoint aBurmese Advisory Council who would, however, have no executive power, muchin the same way as I was assisted by my Ministers during the later stages of the invasion.6.   Study of Measures for remedying past defects.(1) It will be necessary closely to study the defects which both pre-warand war experience have brought to light and to formulate proposals to remedythem.I attach great importance to this, not only so that wre may be enabled tore build Burma on sounder foundations but also so that we may be able to carryworld opinion with us.(2) I consider that it will&apos; be desirable to conduct these studies simultaneously in England and in India. It may be that we have something to learn from themethods of Colonial administration adopted by other countries, e.g., Holland andBelgium. This aspect might well be dealt with in England. Again, it wouldseem appropriate that the question of the future relationship between Governmentand British business firms should be examined with the head-offices of the firms concerned.It might be advisable to bring home one or two officers with recent experienceof Burma, and I would welcome the sending of Burma-Office officials to^ndra towork in conjunction with my officers.(3) I would like to have authority to call in outside experts if the needarises. Agriculture, Industry, Town Planning, Finance, Labour and Educationwill all have to be considered and plans formulated for your approval. Maybenew minds brought to bear on our problems might produce new and beneficialideas.7.   My suggestions may be summarised as follows : (1) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should be prepared themselves (subjectto any inter-Allied arrangements which may be reached) to providefunds for the reconstruction of Burma.(2) That for the period of reconstruction we should decide to resort to asystem of direct rule. A time limit of not more than seven years andnot less than five years should be set on this period.(3) That during this period the Governor should consult Burman opinionthrough such advisory bodies as may appear most suitable.(4) That-we should undertake to consult with Burma before the end of thisperiod, with a view to fulfilling our pledge of granting that countryfull self-government. I would consult you further as to the time for,and form of, this undertaking.(5) That in order to avoid reviving the bad features of pre-war Burma andso that we may return to Burma with a definite idea of our immediatecourse of action, the whole range of our administration should be studied and remedial proposals formulated.R.
