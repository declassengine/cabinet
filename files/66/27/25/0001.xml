Although we were reluctant to incur the commitment of further operations in Madagascar, it had become apparent that no real progress hadbeen made in the negotiations with the Tananarive Authorities and General Platthad clearly indicated that he was of the opinion that a satisfactory modus vivendiwould not be reached without the preliminary use of force.3. When our report was discussed with the Prime Minister it was decidedthat the assault shipping earmarked for further operations in Madagascar mustreturn to this country without delay for certain other operations. It appeared,therefore, that operations to clean up Madagascar might have to be postponed,but a telegram was sent instructing &apos;G.O.C.-in-C, East Africa, and C.-in-C,Eastern Fleet, to prepare the best possible plan without the use of thisspecialised assault shipping.4. An exchange of telegrams with the Commanders-in-Chief, the last twoof which are attached at Annexes II and III, shovys that further operations are believed to be practicable with the resources that can be made available and to have good prospects of success.5. We attach at Annex I a note showing the advantages of cleaning upthe island and describing the outline plan and the Forces involved.6. We recommend that the War Cabinet should authorise the Commanders-in-CKief to undertake these further operations on the lines they propose.(Signed)     C. PORTAL.DUDLEY POUND.A. E.

ANNEX JjNote on Future Operations in Madagascar.Present Situation.Diego Suarez was captured on the 8th May, 1942, by forces consisting of 2. The two brigades of 5th Division have since gone on to India, being-replaced in Madagascar by Negotiations.3. Negotiations for a modus vivendi satisfactory to our interests have not so far achieved any success. Indications are that the Vichy Governor of the island is playing for time, but that if confronted by force he might capitulate.Enemy Forces.4. The total Vichy forces on the Island are estimated at 6,300, located asfollows : Tananarive : 2,300 with eight guns., Tamatave : 1,500 with six guns.Brickaville : 500.Majunga : 1,000.Other Detachments : 1,000.There are only two European companies in the above. Other units are nativetroops with European officers.5.   The Vichy Air Force consists of about eight obsolescent aircraft.6. There is a general shortage of ammunition, and it is expected thatopposition, though likely to be vigorous, is unlikely to be prolonged.Limiting Dates for Operations.7. The rainy season is from October to April, during which periodoperations are not possible.8.   It is estimated that the operations will take forty days from theembarkation of the first brigade at Diego Suarez.   If, therefore, operations areto be completed before the rains, the first embarkation from Diego Suarez must take place on the 18th August, and shipping has already been arranged for this.&quot;Otherwise they will have to be deferred until May 1943.Advantages of Clearing up the Whole Island.9. (i) Naval. Control of the whole of Madagascar is important to our navalsecurity in the Western Indian Ocean and especially to our vital communications between the Cape and the Middle East and India. It would give us naval andair bases from which to patrol the Mozambique Channel, where enemy submarineshave recently been operating. It would also increase the security of Diego Suarez.Even if Majunga only is captured we shall be in a much improved situation ascompared with that now existing.(ii) Economic and Political. Control over Madagascar would be of great advantage from the shipping point of view. The Island could provide certainsupplies to the Middle East and India which at present have to be sent by thelong haul round the Cape, and it could provide cargoes for ships returning tothe United Kingdom from the Middle East and India, many of which at presenthave to return in ballast for lack of cargoes.29th Independent Infantry Brigade.No. 5 Commando.igade 1 f 5th Divisionigade J22nd East African Brigade.27th East African Brigade.7th South African Brigade.
10. The United States are in urgent need of supplies of mica and graphitefrom Madagascar. Unless we can gain control fairly soon they may have to make some arrangements with &quot;Vichy that will tie bur hands in the future.Disadvantages of Undertaking Operations.11. (i) Risk of Failure. Communications generally are poor. The roadsinland from Majunga and Tamatave cross numerous bridges, some of which are known to be prepared for demolition. No bridging equipment is available.Malaria is prevalent, particularly in the rainy season. These, and other hazardsof war, may affect the timetable of operations, which may consequently be prolonged or even fail.(ii) Relations ivith Vichy. Further, operations cannot but worsen ourrelations with the Vichy Government.General PlatVs Opinion.12. On the 3rd August we asked General Platt for a final opinion as toprospects of success. Our telegram* and General Platfs reply! are attached.General Platt considers that the main risks are damaged bridges on the routesof advance and the possible difficulty of landing at Tamatave. He states, however,that the advantages of success are so great that we would be justified in running the risks.13. - He is confident that he would have no difficulty in capturing Majungaand that, even if he does not take the other places, our situation would be betterwith both Majunga and Diego Suarez in our hands than if we only had DiegoSuarez.Outline of Plan.14. General Platt proposes action in the following phases (illustrated byattached map).Phase 1.29th Infantry Brigade Group? which has been specially trained and equipped for the type of operation, embarks at Diego Suarez on D.-1 andreaches Mombasa on D. 6. The Brigade Group then spends ten days intraining.   It leaves Mombasa on D. 17.Phase 2.22nd East African Brigade sails from Diego Suarez in separate ship-ping about D. 17 or D. 18 in time to join 29th Brigade convoy off Majunga.Phase 3.Majunga is assaulted by 29th Infantry Brigade Group.Phase 4.22nd East African Brigade relieves 29th Infantry Brigade at Majungaand advances on Tananarive, which should be reached about D. 30, on theassumption that the bridges are not blown and that no opposition isencountered.   Subsequently they will, if possible, advance on Brickaville.Phase 5.29th Infantry Brigade having sailed from Majunga to, Tamataveassaults the latter place about D. 28 and advances by land on Brickaville,which should be reached by D. 33.Phase 6.Occupation of Tulear by a detachment sent overland.* Annex II, No. O.Z. 897 (C.O.S.

Shipping to meet the requirements of this plan can be provided at theexpense of some slight curtailment of Indian Ocean movement. This will not affect operation &quot; Torch,&quot; but will entail postponement of training for Anakim-for some three months.Eventual Commitments.18. . The final garrison required for the whole Island is the equivalent ofthree infantry brigade groups.19. It is intended that 29th Independent Infantry Brigade should proceedto India as soon as operations are completed, and also that 7th South AfricanBrigade, should proceed to Middle East as soon as it can be spared. This would leave only 22nd and 27th East African Brigades in the Island, and one additionalbrigade will therefore be required for the final garrison. It will probably benecessary to provide this from the United Kingdom.ANNEX II.Telegram No. OZ. 897.   From Air Ministry to General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, East Africa.(OZ. 897.   3.8.42.)Following from Chiefs of Staff, No. (EA.) 7 :-1. Orders have been issued for necessary movements of shipping. &amp;c, toenable you to carry out &quot;your plan for clearing up situation in Madagascar.2. Successful completion of operation is dependent on time-table given inyour 0/40740 of 27th July. While, of course, you are right to work out theprobable sequence of events step by step, arrangements necessitated by shippinglimitations constitute considerable change in original conception of your plan, and-we wish to know if your time-table is likely to be affected by them. There are many hazards and mishaps inseparable from operations of war which may affect,   your time-table.3. From Naval point of view, it is important that whole of Madagascarshould be cleared up, provided that operations have good prospects of success. Onthe other hand, it is obvious that, from the military and political points of view,it would be extremely dangerous to fail or even only partially succeed, as we wouldthen be in worse case than at present. Owing to the situation and possibilities in middle East there is no hope of our being able to provide reinforcements for you should things go wrong. Therefore, and since we are now working upon such a jnarrow margin of time before incidence of rains, we now request your frank and considered opinion as to prospects of success.4. Pending receipt of your reply and final consideration here all movementsordered in our immediately preceding telegram will go ahead. They will be cancelled only if decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government is that operations shouldnot be undertaken.
Annex III.Telegram No. IZ 1043 from East Africa Command to Air Ministry SpecialSianal Office.(42471.   4.8.42.) -From Commander-in-Chief in reply to Chiefs of Staff (E.A.) 7 : 1. If ships sent are good and arrive in time do not think shippinglimitations will make any difference to timetable given in my 40740 of 27th July,1942.2. Am confident we shall have no difficulty in taking Majunga. Even ifwe do not take the other places we shall be better off with both Majunga andDiego Suarez in our hands than if we only had Diego Suarez.3. Advance of 22nd Brigade from Majunga on Tananarive is in firstplace dependent on our finding the bridges intact. Note that bridge over RiverBetsibbka is 1,600 feet long and we have no material to repair it if seriously damaged, nor are we likely to find any.4. Tamatave will be a much more- difficult landing than Majunga. Thereis no sheltered water other than inside the harbour, and possibility of usinglanding craft will depend on the weather and cannot be predicted.5. Road Tamatave-Bric^ville-Tananarive contains numerous bridges, manyof which are known to be prepared for demolition. If these are blown we areagain likely to be held up by obstacles which we have no material to repair.Bridges will be a hazard on both sides of the island. There is, however, a good chance, that any Governor-General will surrender when confronted with forcemajeure. I appreciate that you cannot provide me with any reinforcements andI have none to send myself.6. The risks are the bridges and the difficulty of landing at Tamatave. Theadvantages of success, however, are so great that I consider we would be justifiedin running the risks.7. Success in this operation having been obtained I should at once pushsouthwards with light forces with the intention of seizing Tulear. latest information is that the road is now open.
