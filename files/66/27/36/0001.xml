(42) 92nd Conclusions, Minute 3) we have examined&quot; thequestion of the French Fleet at Alexandria with special reference to theagreement between the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, and admiral godfroy by which the position of the French Squadron is regulated. Theresults of our joint examination are embodied in Annex I to this paper.2.   The main conclusions are as follows : (a) Admiral Godfroy has so far carried out the Agreement and is unlikely to break it even if ordered to do so by Vichy, unless the fall ofAlexandria becomes imminent. Practical considerations also makeit unlikely that he will play us false whilst our hold on the portremains firm. The possibility of a less scrupulous subordinate taking over control must, however, be borne in mind.(b) There is very little chance of the French fleet breaking out successfullywhilst we still control Alexandria.(c) Admiral Godfroy will resist forcible action from any quarter.   Hisdominant motive is to save his ships for France. The armamenthe retains ensures that the capture or forcible removal of his ships or even the destruction of their wireless could only be carried outafter a major operation.(d)At this time of crisis Admiral Godfroy is very unlikely to agree tothe curtailment of the wireless facilities which are expressly reserved to him under the agreement. We cannot deprive him of them except by threats of violent action which would only be likely to cause the- present difficult situation to deteriorate further. Even then he could probably afterwards rig up a wireless telegraph set for use in emergency.3.   These conclusions suggest two possible courses of action :-(a) We can allow the agreement to remain in force in the hope that admiral godfroy will agree to follow us at the last moment before the Germansreach Alexandria rather than see his ships destroyed, but with theknowledge that, if he refuses, Admiral Harwood acting on his existing instructions will sink them.11823   [24219] b
(b) Alternatively we can contend that the recent action of the French hasmade the Agreement invalid and apply pressure to Admiral Godfroyto accept a revised Agreement giving us the right to require thedespatch of the ships to some other port under Allied control incase of emergency. Such a course of action might be justified onthe grounds that Admiral Godfi!oy&apos;s persistent refusal of AdmiralHarwood&apos;s request to sail his ships to another port under allied control is inconsistent with Clause 4 of the Agreement and that hisinsistence on going to a French port is contrary to Clause 9. Furtherjustification would be that the French Admiralty&apos;s order tosail the ships for a French port is inconsistent with the spirit of thesame Clauses of the Agreement. The pressure that we could applywould, be to threaten to cut off all water and supplies from the ships and stop all shore leave unless Admiral Godfroy agreed to our terms.He would probably refuse, however, to yield to such pressure and theships might be able to hold out for a considerable time because it ispossible for them to distil fresh water on board and they almost certainly have substantial reserve supplies of provisions. In the last resort the French could scuttle their ships and come ashore.4. The Admiralty favour the former of the two alternatives. They considerthat the second alternative, although it might eliminate any chance of the french ships escaping us,, would create much greater bitterness in France and in theFrench Navy than the destruction of the ships under imminent threat of theirfalling into the power of the enemy. Moreover, it would be likely to create a prolonged period of tension in Alexandria harbour very embarrassing to theMiddle East authorities. The Admiralty are of the opinion that our interestswill be best served by keeping Godfroy to his Agreement so long as we holdEommel in Egypt and in the meanwhile avoiding anything likely to stir up theFrench * squadron unnecessarily. We can pursue this policy in the knowledge that Admiral Harwood has clear instructions to destroy the French ships shouldthe need arise.A. E.A. V. A.August 12, 1942.
ANNEX I.THE agreement providing for the immobilisation of the French ships in alexandria for the duration of the war was negotiated by Admiral Cunninghamas a personal agreement between himself and Admiral Godfroy. It was concluded on 4th July, 1940, the day following our attack on the French fleet at Oran, under imminent threat of an engagement between the two fleets at alexandria. It saved the situation at the time and worked sufficiently satisfac-satisfactorily to be renewed with certain amendments when Admiral Harwood succeededAdmiral Cunningham. The text of the renewed agreement signed on 20th june last is attached as Annex 2.2.   Our main obligations under the agreement (a) To provide for the Squadron (expenses are debited to the French underthe Reciprocal Advances Account);(b) Not to try to seize the ships;(c) To permit communication with France by post, subject to censorship;(a) To permit communication by W/T from the Flag Ship Duquesne only;\e) To allow the ships to return to France as soon as the war in Europe hasended.3.   Admiral Godfroy&apos;s obligations (a) To maintain the ships in their existing state of disarmament;(b) Not to scuttle them or to attempt to leave harbour except by agreementwith Admiral Harwood;(c) To see that the personnel of his Squadron undertake no hostile act against british ships or establishments and that there are no men in hisSquadron engaged in anti-British activities;(d) To control the use of W/T so that no message affecting or referring tothe operations of the British Fleet is sent.4. Let-out Clauses. The preamble to the new agreement states that it isthe desire of the two Admirals that the agreement should &apos;&apos; remain in forcewhatever circumstances may arise in the future, except only in the case whereone or other of the Governments declares war, in which event a new situation notgoverned by this agreement would arise.&quot; The preamble thus ties our handsvery closely, and even the exception is rigidly expressed, since a state ofhostilities may arise between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Vichy Govern-ment without any formal declaration of war. On the other hand, it must b3admitted that unless the phrase &apos; - declares war &apos;&apos; had been used, our operations in Syria and, more recently, in Madagascar, might have been said to bring theexception in the preamble into play.5. Notwithstanding the language of the preamble, the agreement containstwo other clauses which contemplate departure from the agreement in certain eventualities.(a) Clause 11 provides that in the event of French warships being taken over and used against the British by the countries with which GreatBritain is at war, the agreement will be reconsidered. Recent press reports about French submarines being handed over to Germany must at present be discounted, but if anything of this kind occurredClause 11 would clearly come into force.(b) Clause 4 provides that the French ships will not attempt to leave the harbour except in the event of its being menaced by hostile land or seaforces, in which case any movement would be agreed between theCommander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, and the French Vice-Admiral.If the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, is not present in the portany negotiations would be conducted through his accredited deputy.8. Clause 4 was not included in the original agreement, and &quot;its insertionm the revised agreement does not carry us very much further, because, under it,any move from Alexandria depends upon agreement between the two Admirals,and it is just this agreement that is lacking. But the Clause assumes considerable importance when read in conjunction with Clause 9, which states that the french ships will be free to return to France as soon as the war in Europe has ended.It may legitimately be argued from these two clauses and from the whole tenor[24219] &apos; B 2
of the agreement that its chief purpose was to provide for the safe custody ofthe ships in British hands until the end of the war. For not only does Clause 4clearly indicate that internment in the port of Alexandria is not a cardinalcondition essential to the validity of the agreement, but Clause 9 shows that theright of the French ships to return to France arises only at the end of the warin Europe.7. Admiral Godfroy&apos;s Observance of his Obligations. Subject to what canbe said about his refusal to proceed through the Suez Canal to another Port under british or United States control, it must be admitted that Admiral Godfroy&apos;conduct has, so far as we know, been correct. Although the French crews are allowed to go ashore freely, and although Admiral Godfroy is allowed tocommunicate with Vichy in a cypher to which we do not possess the key, there isno evidence of any leakage of information traceable to the French. For example,the enemy did not, we are pretty sure, obtain any information from the Frenchabout the human torpedo attacks on Valiant and Queen Elizabeth, or about the departure of the latter ship from Alexandria, both of which pieces of information would have been of very great value to the enemy. French ships have, in fact,given as little trouble as could have been expected, and Admiral Godfroy&apos;conduct at the time of the Syrian incident was scrupulously correct, even whenBritish and French warships Avere in action against each other at no greatdistance from Alexandria. ,8. Admiral Godfroy&apos;s Wireless Facilities. He can communicate with theFrench Admiralty in a cypher which we are not able to read. Normally the totalnumber of messages sent per week in both directions does not exceed three perweek. On the 30th June. 1st, 2nd and 3rd July the traffic rose to six per clay,but then returned to the normal three per week. As already stated, there is no evidence that the wireless facilities have been used to report our movements, and admiral Godfroy himself volunteered to the Commander-in-Chief that he would consider it inconsistent with the agreement to transmit political reports. x\s allthe surface ships have several wireless installations the forcible interruption ofhis W/T communication with Vichy cannot be achieved without a majorengagement. Even then, if the &quot;main installations were destroyed, the french would have little difficulty in fixing up temporary transmitters and receivers.9.   Conditions of the French ships (a) Armament. The main and  torpedo armament have been renderedineffective. The secondary armament and the A.A. guns are in working order. There is adequate ammunition on board. It ispossible that, in an emergency, parts for some of the main armamentscould be improvised to permit a few rounds being fired. The lightarmament is sufficient to make it impossible to capture the ships byassault without incurring heavy losses, but to do this would in any caserequire a large part of the Mediterranean Fleet in harbour, whereasat present there are no important British units in Alexandria. Theships are also in a position to inflict considerable but not vital damage to shore establishments.(b) Fuel. All fuel was discharged on the 4th July, 1940, and since then the ships have been allotted a weekly ration sufficient only to maintainthe auxiliary engines. Even by. strict economy they can hardly havesaved enough to enable them to go very far.(c) Speed. The ships must by now be very foul owing to the marine growthsand their speed, therefore, very seriously reduced.(d) Crews are one-third of the normal complement.    No reliefs have yet arrived under the provision in the new agreement.10. Possibility of escape: It would be difficult for the ships to get out ofthe harbour in the face of opposition. Their preparations would also certainly be observed, they would come under point-blank fire from harbour defences andin any event it is not by any means a simple manoeuvre for the heavier ships tonavigate out of the harbour. If they did succeed in breaking out the two destroyers and the submarine might have a chance of escaping to an enemy-controlled port, but the heavier ships could probably be sunk by air action.Moreover, owing to their reduced complements, the ships could not fighteffectively. It is unlikely, therefore, that Admiral Godfroy would attempt toleave harbour in the face of opposition.
11. Scuttling. Scuttling charges are known to have been prepared by theFrench long ago, a fact which renders capture of the ships intact out of thequestion, since the charges can be fired electrically by the mere pressing of abutton. If scuttled where they now lie the ships would in no way obstruct ouruse of the harbour. They would, in fact, Only sink about 4 feet and could easily be raised again by the Germans (or by ourselves). If still in possession of the harbour and with time at our disposal we could, of course, seriously increase the damage by dealing with the ships after scuttling.12. Frejich Admiralty&apos;s instructions to Admiral Godfroy. On the28th June Admiral Harwood reported &quot; Godfroy showed me his instructions from French Admiralty that ships were not to be allowed to fall into the handsof any foreigner.&quot; Again Laval stated in his Aide-Memoire of the 2nd July tothe United States Charge d&apos;Affaires that &quot; on the 26th June Auphan had instructed Godfroy that, if the British had to evacuate, he was to endeavour toreach a French port. If that were impossible he and his ships were to stay on at alexandria under the French Flag. He was reminded that the French ships should not fall into foreign hands.&quot; The instruction to try and reach a Frenchport is considered inconsistent with Clause 4 of the new Agreement, which provides that the ships shall only be moved by agreement between the twosignatories, and with Clause 9, which provides for the return of the ships toFrance only at the end of the war.13. Admiral Godfroy&apos;s personal assurances. When telling Admiral Har-wood of his instructions from the French Admiralty, Admiral Godfroy remindedhim that he had always promised to scuttle the ships to prevent them falling intoforeign hands. On the 2nd July Admiral Harwood reported &quot;that admiral godfroy had asked him to* assure His Majesty&apos;s Government that he and hisCaptains are determined their ships shall never fall into the hands of theGermans.&quot;14. British Admiralty&apos;s instructions to Admiral Harwood. Admiral Har-wood was instructed on the 30th June to invite Admiral Godfroy to remove hisships from Alexandria and to tell him that if he insisted on staying in Alexandriaand thereby risked his ships falling into the hands of the enemy we should regard it as a hostile act and consider the Agreement at an end. Admiral Harwoodwas also instructed that, if Admiral Godfroy refused to leave, we snould have to destroy his ships if, and when, occupation of Alexandria by the enemy becameimminent, and that he should convey a hint to Admiral Godfroy to this effect.On the 3rd July Admiral Harwood was told that this action should not be taken until it was certain that Alexandria will fall, but that once he has decided to take action the most drastic steps must be taken to prevent any of the French shipsgoing back to France. Such steps as are possible should be taken to save life.Admiral Harwood has not, therefore, yet informed Admiral Godfroy explicitlythat in the event of the fall of Alexandria becoming certain our intention is to destroy his ships. The United States, however, by proclaiming that in such circumstances the destruction of the ships by the British would be justified, havegiven a pretty plain hint of the action that we are likely to take.ANNEX II.Agreement of June 20, 1942, between Admiral Harwood and Admiral Godfroy.THE British Naval Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, and the Vice-Admiral Commanding, Force &quot; X,&quot; wishing that the agreement already in force should be renewed with certain modifications to meet present conditions and remain in force whatever circumstances may arise in the future (except only in;the case where one or other of the Governments declares war, in which event anew situation not governed by this agreement would arise), accept the following provisions : (1) The French ships will be maintained in their present state as regardsmaterial.  They will not be scuttled.(2) No attempt will be made by the British to seize the French ships by force.
(3) The personnel of Force &quot; X &quot; will undertake no hostile act against british ships or establishments.(4) The French ships will not attempt to leave the harbour except in the eventof its being menaced by hostile land or sea forces, in which case any movementwould be agreed between the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, and the Vice-Admiral Commanding Force &quot;X.&quot; If the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean,is not present in the port, any negotiations would be conducted through hisaccredited deputy.(5) The support and pay of the personnel of the warships at Alexandria willcontinue to be provided as at present by an agreed monthly sum until the FrenchGovernment are in a position to take over this responsibility.(6) The personnel of Force &quot; X &apos;&apos; may be relieved on a pre-arranged scale,provided that (a) Admiral Godfroy remains in Alexandria in command of Force &quot; X.&quot;(b) That he will not tolerate the arrival or the presence in his squadron ofmen who ensrage in anti-British activities, or any that the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, considers a, menace to British security.(c) The right to obtain reliefs will be used to reduce the pay-bills of the squadron.The movement of relief ships will be the subject of a special agreement, it being understood that for reasons of security no ship is sailed without the concurrence of the British Commander-in-Chief,Mediterranean, as to the time of departure and route.(7) Personnel will be free to land in the normal way and to communicate byletter under existing censorship regulations. Mail will continue to be sent inthe manner communicated in Med. 00181/4 (a) of the 16th November, 1941.Official mail may be sent through the Office of Commander-in-Chief to the SwissEmbassy, Cairo.(8) W/T communication will be carried out from Duquesne only, whowill exercise control to ensure that no message affecting or referring to theoperations of the British Fleet is permitted.(9) The French ships will be free to return to France as soon as the war inEurope has ended.(10) This agreement can only be modified by agreement between the signatories (should either change his command a fresh agreement will be madeprior to his departure).(11) In the event of French warships being taken over and used against theBritish by the countries with which Great Britain is at war, this agreement willbe reconsidered.(Signed.)   R. E. GODFROY. (Signed)   H. H. HARWOOD,A admiral.June 20, 1942.
