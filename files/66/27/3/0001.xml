THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1942.SECRET Copy No.W.P. (42) 323.August 1, 1942.Jj^Ji*L5?^J[. UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE DAILY  WORKER.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.THE decision of the Government that an order should be made under defence Regulation 2D for the suppression of the Daily Worker was&apos; taken iuJanuary 1941. At that time the doctrine of the Communist Party was that thewar was a contest between rival capitalist and imperialist Powers, and the policyof the Daily Worker during the period between October 1939 and the date of itssuppression had been to do all that was possible to hinder the national war effortshort of open and direct incitement to obstruct that effort.2. After Germany&apos;s attack on Russia the line taken by the CommunistParty changed. For a week or two the doctrine was that two wars were beingwaged one a holy crusade by the Soviet Government in defence of the SocialistFatherland, and the other a wicked imperialist war between the Germancapitalists on the one side and the British and American capitalists on theother side.In the early part of July 1941 there was another change in the Communistpolicy, and a decision was taken that &quot; the war for the defeat of Hitler is now the supreme issue.....When Comrade Stalin refers to Churchill&apos;s declarationas a &apos; historic utterance &apos; this leaves no room for doubt as to what our attitudetowards this Government should be.   Our fight is not directed against theChurchill Government, but those who are the secret friends of Hitler.....Weare prepared to give the Churchill Government our full support.....We do this wholeJieartedly without any reservations, without harping on the disagree-ments of the past or raising the fundamental differences between the CommunistParty and other political parties.&quot;3. Since that date the- new policy has been consistently followed by theCommunist Party. A few of their followers have found it difficult to make thenew switchover in policy, and from time to time there are reported to me isolatedspeeches by Communist supporters which follow the old line of creating distrustin the policy and motives of the Government and in all those who are responsiblefor the direction and organisation of our war effort. But speeches of this kindare exceptional. There is no doubt that the present policy of the Party is to do all they can to stimulate and advance the war effort, whilst also urging theopening of a &quot; second front.&quot;This does not mean that the Communist Party has in any way abandoned itsrevolutionary aims, but it recognises that it can best strengthen its position inthe country at the present time by championing the united front with Russia forthe defeat of Fascism, and saying little or nothing about its ultimate politicalpolicy.4. The Party having now for over twelve months given its support to thewar effort, it becomes increasingly difficult to justify the continuation of theorder forbidding the publication of the newspaper which is the Party organ.As frequently stated, the policy of the Government is to make the minimumuse of any powers under the Defence Regulations which limit the traditionalfreedom for the expression of opinions, and to refrain from any interference[24169]
with the Press unless there is systematic publication of matter calculated to havea substantially detrimental effect on the war effort. Can it be maintained thatthe reappearance of the Daily Worker would be likely to have such an effect ?No doubt if the Daily Worker is permitted to reappear there is some risk that carping and mischievous criticisms will be published and that the paper willbe used to further the ultimate political objects of the Communist party; but these are not in themselves valid grounds for suppression under Regulation 2D.In many papers much is written from time to time which is likely to be harmfulrather than helpful to the war effort, but, however ill-advised some of thesewritings may be, it is not the policy of the Government to interfere with papersof which the general policy is to assist in the prosecution of the war.5. Support for the view that the ban on the Daily Worker should be revoked has been expressed in many quarters, including such papers as theNezus Chronicle, the Daily Express, the Evening Standard, the New State$?nanand the Spectator.The recent decision to. remove the ban in India on two Communist paperswill, no doubt, be used as an additional argument for the lifting of the ban onthe Daily Worker.6. My own view, as stated in the memorandum which I circulated to theCabinet on the 29th May, 1942 (W.P. (42) 230), has been that revocation oughtto be considered, if possible, before the end of the war. If prohibition is continued till the end of the war and the paper, after a long period of suppression,then breaks forth freed from such restraining influence as the present Communistwar policy imposes and from the special restrictions imposed by defence regulations, the dangers of its use for subversive purposes in the difficult times of post-war reconstruction will be aggravated.7. In view of the instability of the Communist attitude towards the war asshown by the sudden changes in its policy in October 1939 and in June and july 1941, I was justified in maintaining that it would be premature and rashto lift the ban on the Daily Worker immediately after the decision of the Partyin July 1941 to support the war effort. But that support having been consistentlygiven for over a year, further delay in revoking the prohibition is difficultto justify.My own view is that the time has now come when it would be right to revoke the prohibition at once and to announce this decision before the House adjournsfor the August recess.8. I have considered whether there would be any advantage in trying toobtain from those who will be responsible for the paper some guarantee of good behaviour, but my conclusion is that such a course would be inexpedient. If theban is lifted, the paper should be put in the same position as other papers and given the full freedom which is allowed by the law for the expression of opinion.If I were to ask for any guarantee, there would be a danger of the paper claimingin the future that in the absence of any representations from me it must beinferred that whatever it publishes the Government regards as legitimate andjustifiable. Moreover, I do not think it expedient to enable the Communist Partyto say that I have recognised their reliability and trustworthiness by acceptingtheir guarantees. The real guarantee lies not in any assurance given by theleaders of the Communist Party but in the fact that, if the paper should againsystematically publish matter calculated to foment opposition to the war effort.Regulation 2D can again be used for its suppression.If it be decided to revoke the ban, I would propose in announcing thedecision to say that it will of course be necessary to keep a watch on ttie paper and that the revocation of the order of prohibition does not in the least preventthe making of a fresh order should the paper again systematically publish mattercalculated to foment opposition to the war effort.9. At the same time as the Daily Worker was suppressed in January 1941,a weekly news sheet called the Week, edited by Claud Cockburn, alias FrankPitcairn, one of the principal journalists of tihe Daily Worker, was alsosuppressed. This sheet advocated the same views as the Daily Worker in a stylewhich had a less popular and more intellectual appeal. If the order against the daily Worker is revoked, I would propose that the order applying to the Weekshould also be revoked.H. M.Home Office,August 1, 1942.
