This report is based on revised estimates of requirements for the twelvemonths to 30th June, 1943, which have just been received, and after consultationwith the Joint Planning Staff, who suggested that the following assumptionsshould be made : (a) that the loss of Abadan is due to a German advance from the North;(b) that with Persia in German hands, the Iraq oilfields would have to be denied to the enemy so that no oil supplies would be available ati Haifa or Tripoli;(c) that the loss of Bahrein would not necessarily result from (a);(d) that production from  the  Suez  refinery would  continue but  seeparagraph 12;(e) that as a result of (a) our military requirements in Iraq and Persiawould be transferred to India and/or Egypt;(/) that apart from (e) requirements would remain as at present.It has also been assumed in view of (a) that supplies to Russia via the persian gulf would cease, thereby reducing oil bunkering requirements.3. Under present conditions we are counting upon Middle Eastern sourcesfor the following oil supplies for the year ending the 30th June, 1943 : Tons.From the Persian Gulf    ............     11,558,000&apos;   From Haifa ...............      1,923,000From Tripoli ............... 145,000From Suez   ..................        959,00014,585,000Details of the areas for which these supplies are required are shown in theattached schedule.!* CCS. (42) 164th Meeting, Minute 5. v-, f Annex.[24138]
4. If Abadan, Haifa and Tripoli are denied to us, the only alternative sources of supply would be :  (a) increased production from Bahrein;(6) Gulf of Mexico or N.W.I.;(c) California.Assuming maximum increase under (a) (which it should be pointed out would more than double any output that has hitherto been achieved), the followingquantities would be required from : Tons.Gulf of Mexico and N.W.1...........      8,698.000California    ..................      1.968.00010,666,000This would add 200 to the number of tankers* required to meet our presentsupply programme even after allowing for transference of bunkering fromports near to Abadan to ports near to the new sources of supply.5. If Bahrein also ceased to be available as a source of supply, an additional2,750,000 tons would have to be drawn from the Gulf or N.W.I.. adding a further70 to the number of tankers required, making 270 required in all.6. While the necessary supplies of most products could probably be madeavailable in the Gulf, N.W.I. or California, a supply problem of the first magnitude-tude would arise in respect of Aviation Spirit, and considerable difficulty wouldbe created in regard to Admiralty fuel oil.(a) Aviation Spirit (particularly 100 octane) is in such increasing demand that it already presents a major problem. A very large increase-in production in the TJ.S.A. is being effected, but it is agreed by bothU.S.A. and &quot;British authorities that, with the best that can be hoped for from this and increased production elsewhere, stringency in supplies of this vital product will continue for a considerable period.The loss of the supplies from Abadan, which are estimated to rise from about 240,000 tons a year at present to 800,000 tons a year bythe autumn of 1943, would therefore be irreplaceable.(b) Admiralty Fuel Oil. Abadan and Haifa fuel oil is specially suitablefor naval use and the present programme envisages the supply ofover 2,500,000 tons during the next twelve months. Quantitativelythis could probably be replaced elsewhere, but qualitatively oil ofa lower specification might have to.be accepted.With 80 per cent, of our oil supplies to come from the Gulf or the N.W.I.our position would, however, be very vulnerable to enemy interference.7. It would not, however, be the availability of oil supplies (except inthe case of aviation spirit) but the impossibility of finding the additionalshipping capacity that would cause the real difficulty. We are already short of the tankers we shall require to meet our needs as estimated for the next12 months and without further assistance from America we shall be unableto fulfil even our own programme, quite apart from the rapidly rising needsof the United States Forces in the British Isles. The assistance we are likelyto require is, moreover, on a scale which will tax to the limit the United Statesability to free tanker tonnage by further increases in the transportation of oilby rail, pipe and barge in the United States.8. In these circumstances, the loss of supplies from the Persian and Iraqoilfields would necessitate a pro rata reduction of over 20 per cent, in allconsumption in the West as well as in the East (including consumption by the-Services and for shipping) if tanker tonnage requirements are to be brought down to what we are likely to be able to achieve. If Bahrein&apos; were lost aswell, an even higher reduction would be necessary.* Of 10,000 tons cargo carrying capacity.
9. Consumption in the United Kingdom has already been cut several times and on -tho laptMnhmmaioii nho oil CemlrBl1 JBQaiitdinoiipyacfrod tkfrMwierr ithas been generally accepted that the latest cut represented the utmost that could be achieved without adverse effect on our war effort. Large cuts havealso been made in India and in the Dominions and Colonies. While, therefore,there may still be consumption of oil that is intermediate between essential andunessential (in that though contributing to the war effort its elimination mightnot have too serious an effect) such consumption is undoubtedly small. Pro ratacuts of the order indicated in the preceding paragraph would therefore be quite impracticable.10. Without a detailed examination in collaboration with the Governmentsof the various countries concerned, it is not possible to state exactly what cutsin Eastern consumption could be made and their probable effect on the war effort. From a consideration of what is here known of the principal demands; in each area, it has, however, been estimated that cuts of oil consumption in: the East amounting to something, over a million tons a year might be made,though this might have a serious effect on the war effort. It is calculated thata cut of this order would reduce the figure of 200 additional tankers given inparagraph 4 to about 155; and, if Bahrein also ceased to be available as a source of supply, the figure of 270 additional tankers given in paragraph 5would be reduced to 225.11. The alternative of achieving an average cut of the order requiredby entirely abandoning areas where the maintenance of oil supplies involves the greatest use of tanker tonnage raises issues on which the Oil Control board are not competent to express an opinion. The following conversion table shows,however, the extent to which elimination of requirements in one area couldbe made to benefit another.One tanker in one year could carry : FromGulf ...N.W.I. ...Gulf ...N.W.I. ...Gulf &quot;...N.W.I. ...Gulf ...N.W.I. ...CaliforniaToU.K.Middle EastMiddle EastIndiaIndiaSouth africa south AfricaAustraliaTons37,00023,00026,00026.00030,00040,00050,00037,00012. The Oil Control Board feel compelled to draw attention to the factthat hypothesis (d) in paragraph 2 now appears to be divorced from reality.The Suez refinery is now very vulnerable to air attack, and if put out of action would add some 40 tankers to the additional number of tankers that wouldbe required to maintain supplies if we were deprived of the other Middle Easternsources of supply. Moreover, the loss of the Suez and Haifa refineries (andthe Air Staff have recently expressed the view that both these refineries areliable to be heavily raided in the immediate future), even assuming that thePersian Gulf supplies remained available, would create an immediate problem which would be no easy matter to meet.13. The conclusion from the foregoing is that it is of vital importance thatthere should be a maximum concentration on the military effort needed to safe-guard the Persian oilfields. Their loss would be calamitous, inasmuch as it wouldenforce a drastic reduction in our total war capacity, and probably theabandonment of some of our present fields of action.Great George Street, S.W. 1,July 21, 1942.(Initialled)   G.
