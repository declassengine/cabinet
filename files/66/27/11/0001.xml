3 0(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE property  OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).   &apos;S E C R E T.W.P.(42)  5.31, COPY NO1ST AUGUST.  1942.WAR CABINET.SERVICE PAY AMD ALLOWANCES ,Note by the Chancellor off the exchequer understand that the Secretary of State forWar proposes to raise at the War Cabinet on Monday,5rd August, the question on the Order Paper inrelation to increased pay and allowances for theForces,     I think that the War Cabinet may, in thesecircumstances, like to see the attached copy of aletter which I have sent on this subject to the service ministers.(Intld.)    K.W.Treasury Chambers,TREASURY CHAMBERS,50th July, 1942.My dear First Lord,In view of the growing agitation in the House andin the Press on the subject of Service pay and allowances, I think it would be as well that I shouldlet you and the other Service Ministers know atonce how I myself view the subject so that we may agree on policy well ahead of the debate which will no doubttake place when the House reassembles.So far we have nothing at all precise in theway of suggestions from the critics, who confinethemselves to general assertions that present rates of pay and allowances both for other ranks and for junior officers are inadequate.     Whether the agitation in theHouse and in the newspapers represents any real feeling in the Services and the country as a whole is, I imagine,difficult to judge;   hut if there is a general feeling that the Services are being unfairly treated I suggestthat it arises partly at any rate from widespreadIgnorance of what Service emoluments really amount to.

I need not remind you of the numerous and repeatedimprovements which have been made since the outbreak of war,ThQBe improvements cover pay, family allowances, dependants&apos;allowances, War Service Grants, lowering of compulsoryallotments and the post-war credit,     A little over sixmonths ago the Government announced that it was undertaking a comprehensive roview of Service emoluments, and the resultof that review in the shape of various concessions v/as announced by the Prime Minister as recently as last February.I feel that we ought to avoid, if we can, giving any encouragement to the notion that the results of a review ofthis kind are only valid for six months and that theGovernment is ready to be pushed at short- intervals intomaking repeated concessionso     To do so would be quiteinconsistent with our stabilisation policy and owing to thenumbers involved would greatly endanger its maintenance.On the merits of the matter, I am by no means clearthat a case can be made out for further concessions,     i feel sure that the critics take far too little account ofthe real value of the benefits which the Forces receive in kind, which have shielded them to a considerable extent fromthe effect of the war-time rises in the cost of living.The benefits which the man in the Forces enjoys in comparison with people in civil life include not only suchdirect issues as food and clothing but freedom fromdeductions in respect of health and unemployment insurance and from a variety of charges such as those in respect oftravel to and from work which fall very widely on civilians in present circumstances,     I need not recapitulate all thevarious elements of v/hich account must be taken in any fairattempt to compare the financial position of the Forces withthat of the rest of the community, but I suggest that thereis a good deal v/hich- can usefully be said about them if thequestion is publicly debated, in the hope of removing someof the public misapprehensions about theme      Stress is, ofcourse, generally laid on the minimum rates of pay whichare drawn in the Forces and little attention is giveneither to the allowances which supplement them where thereare dependants or to the many factors such as proficiencypay, increments, tradesmen1s rates and widespread promotionwhich result in appreciably higher rates being paid to verylarge numbers of men0     More attention ought also to be paidto the preferential position enjoyed by the Forces inrelation to income taxe     The unmarried civilian now becomes a taxpayer if he earns more than about  2a2s,6da a week, the married man if he earns over  3 and the married man with a child if he earns more than  4C     The real emoluments of a soldier can greatly exceed these figures before he istouched by the income tax at all,,     For example, a marriedstaff sergeant in the Army is exempt although he has a totalcash income for himself and his wife of  403s,6d, per weekand gets in addition his own keep and clothing (as well asthe miscellaneous benefits*to which I have referred above).This factor of income tax is, of course,,particularly important in the case of officers0     I doubt whether the higher ranks in the Forces themselves realisehow heavily the increased rates of taxation fall on civilian incomes0     I think the Service Departments havemade some calculations of the gross civilian incomes

which would be required to yield, after payment of tax, sums equivalent to those which officers may drawin the shape of net pay and untaxed allowances;similar calculations based on conditions at theoutbreak of war show how much the officersrelative position has been improved.     I find itdifficult to believe that the . real emolumentsnow enjoyed by officers can fairly be regardedas unduly lowf and so far as the lower -ranks ofofficers may find themselves in financial difficultiesI wonder whether this may not be due to the incidence of messing charges and other incidentals of a standard of living which is unsuitable to war conditions and out of line with the new standards which are being imposed on the rest of the nation.I am writing similarly to Grigg andSinclair.Yours ever,(Signed)    KINGSLEY WOOD.The Right hon AeV.
