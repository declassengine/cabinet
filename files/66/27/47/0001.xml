This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government /Printed for the War Cabinet, August, 1942W.P. (42) 36721st August, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.WAR cabinet air SERVICE TO THE MIDDLE east memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARThe Ad Hoc Committee, set up by the War Cabinet in November, 1941,to examine what steps could be taken to improve the air service to the middle east and by what date the improvements could be effected, recommended on27th January, 1942 (W.P. (42) 40), that suitable aircraft should be diverted from operational duties to increase the air transport capacity for the middle east and beyond.My predecessor in his memorandum W.P. (42) 65, dated 6th February, 1942,strongly supported these proposals.He did not feel satisfied, however, that the recommendations of theCommittee were commensurate with real requirements and estimated that theArmy at that time required a weekly allotment of 5,000 lbs. to cover its minimumneed for passengers and freight. This estimate was based on the assumptionthat a regular service would be maintained. Regularity, however, was foundto be impossible with the then inadequate number of aircraft.This memorandum was not considered by the War Cabinet, but in view ofsteps which it was understood were being taken to increase the number of aircraft as recommended by the Ad Hoc Committee, I have been content to await the anticipated improvement.The Committee again reported on 29th June, 1942, the steps which werebeing taken to improve the service and the dates by which such improvementscould be effected (W.P. (42) 275).In paragraphs 3 and 4 of that paper they state that the Secretary of Statefor Air had been able to arrange for the addition of 12 Whitleys and 5 Liberators,that the Ministry of Aircraft Production had converted the 12 Whitieys andthat the weekly air capacity on the route was expected to reach 14,000 lbs. inJune, 16,000 lbs. in September and 18,000 lbs. in December, 1942, and 25,000 lbs.in March, 1943.Since then, however, the Secretary of State for Air in W.P. (42) 315 of25th July, 1942, points out in paragraphs 2 and 3 that the increases in thenumber of aircraft, which the Committee were led to suppose would be provided,were not forthcoming. In the first place the Whitleys for technical reasonsproved to be unable to operate in the tropical conditions on the UnitedKingdom West Africa and Egypt routes, and secondly the 5 Liberators wouldhave to be provided from the North Atlantic route, which could not be doneuntil other shorter range Liberators had been converted to take their place.The Secretary of State for Air, however, states in paragraphs 4 and 5 of his paper that the results expected from the proposed increase in aircraft were infact achieved in June and early July, 1942. This was due, however, not to anincrease in aircraft, but by overworking the existing fleet, a performance whichhe admits he cannot promise will be maintained.
The position now is that the number of aircraft available for air transport to the Middle East is the same as it was at the beginning of the year (exceptfor the addition of the &quot; Golden Hind which I understand made one trip tothe West Coast in July), and there is little likelihood of any addition to the fleetfor an indefinite, and in any event considerable, period of time.Since my predecessor in February, 1942, made his estimate of 5,000 lbs. tocover War Office requirements for passengers and freight, these requirements,as the Secretary of State for Air admits, have increased very largely and arelikely to increase in the future. In this connection I would point out that newitems of equipment of a light nature which are urgently required in battlecome out of the factories, and the only method of getting them to overseastheatres in time to be of use is by air. I estimate that a weekly allocation forthe War Office of 10,000 lbs. is now required.I am also concerned at the inadequate provision made for air mail services to the Middle East. The Postmaster-General points out in W.P. (42) 329 thatthe only communications transmitted wholly by air at present are airgraph andthin postcards, the combined weekly weight of which is 2,100 lbs. against an allocation of 1,600 lbs.He further states that there is a pressing need for the introduction of a standard air mail letter which will give greater privacy combined with speed and cheapness.  This service could be put into operation with little, delay.He estimates his weekly requirements for airgraph, thin postcards andstandard air mail letters at 5,000 lbs. I consider that a regular and adequateair mail service giving reasonable privacy in communications as advocated by the Postmaster-General is essential to the maintenance of morale of theArmy in the Middle East.If the over-working of the fleet is persisted in, the result may well be thatthe greater part, if not the whole, will become unserviceable, with nothingavailable for replacement.On the other hand, if normal working is resumed, the lift will drop backto what it was between February and May a weekly average of a little over10,000 lbs. to cover the requirements of all Government Departments.I consider that the present state of affairs is most unsatisfactory and pressmost strongly that immediate steps be taken to provide without further delayfrom other duties such additional aircraft as may be necessary to provide a regular service of aircraft sufficient to carry weekly:  (a) 10,000 lbs. required by the War Office for passengers and freight;(b) 5,000 lbs. to cover air mail, and(c) the reasonable requirements of all other Government Departments.P.
