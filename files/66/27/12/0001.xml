Printed for the War Cabinet.   August 1942.SECRET.Copy No. 9W.P. (42) 332.August 1, 1942.WAR CABINET.PALESTINIANS IN THE FORCES AND L0CAL DEFENCE and police SERVICES.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.IN October 1941 the &quot;War Cabinet decided against the adoption of the schemefor recruitment of Jewish units for general service, but invited the then Secretaryof State for the Colonies to encourage the enrolment of Palestinian Jews upto (say) 5,000 or 10,000 men in the military and police forces in Palestineprimarily for purposes of local defence (W.M. (41) 102nd Conclusions).2. In accordance with this decision recruitment for the various units ofthe British Army in Palestine has continued, and at the end of March theposition was that 10,340 Jews and 4,660 Arabs were serving in the RoyalArtillery, the Royal Engineers, the Palestinian infantry companies of the Buffs,the Royal Air Force, and the ancillary services (Royal Army Medical Corps,Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps, (fee).By the end of June 1942 Jewrs to the number of 23,815 had enrolled in thevarious police organisations as follows : -Of these early this month only approximately 32 per cent, were armed,partly with British and partly with Italian rifles. Thirty-six Jewish SettlementPolice sergeants were to have completed an instruction course by the 12th July,but no officer had then been appointed to co-ordinate training.3. The decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government not to proceed with the schemefor a Jewish Division of the British Army was exceedingly unpalatable to Zionistleaders, and a vigorous campaign has been conducted ever since both in thiscountry and in the United States of America for the formation of a &quot; JewishArmy &quot; similar in type to the other Allied forces. The latest development inAmerica has been the intensification by the &quot; Jewish Army Committee &apos;&apos; of their demands for the creation of an Army of 200,000 Palestinian and Stateless Jewsfor service in the Middle Eastern theatre. This Committee was originally formed by the New Zionists (Revisionists) of America, but&apos;has recently obtained ameasure of support among influential circles of the public in the United States.The activities of the Committee are not entirely unwelcome to the orthodoxZionists in America, and they are making use of the Committee&apos;s campaign topress for the immediate mobilisation of all available Jewish man-power inPalestine.Regular Police*Settlement Police*Temporary Additional Police*Special Police!

24. A recent debate in the House of Lords and a Question in the House ofCommons gave the Government opportunities of re-stating their attitude towardsthe demand for a Jewish Army and increased recruitment of Jews in Palestine.But the unfavourable turn in the military situation in North Africa has not unnaturally aroused apprehension among Jewish circles, and the demand for thearming and training of the Jews in Palestine has become more and more insistentin recent weeks. And, indeed, it cannot be denied that it would not be understoodin this country or America if subject, of course, to military exigencies thefullest practicable preparations were not now made to enable Palestinian jews to defend their homes should the situation require it.5. The danger to Palestine might take the form of an invasion by Axisforces or, in the event of a serious set-back to the Allied forces in South Russiaor the Middle East, an Arab rebellion in Palestine, involving attacks on the Jewishcolonies and settlements.6. The immediate shovt-term policy of the Jewfsh Agency Executive is forthe recruitment, arming, and training of 10,000 urban special police. But it mustbe recognised that the Zionists&apos; demand for the arming, training and equippingof the Palestinian Jews has a political as well as a military aspect. The mainZionist political objective is the creation, at the end of the war, of a Jewish state in Palestine. The existence of a powerful Jewish fighting force, which hadrendered during the war service to the cause of the United Nations, would be a valuable bargaining counter at the Peace Conference. There is moreover, reasonto believe that the more extreme political Zionists who dominate the jewish agency Executive in Palestine have more sinister reasons for their advocacy ofthe arming and training of Palestinian Jews for the military and police forma-tions. Recent confidential speeches by Mr. Shertok, of the Jewish AgencyExecutive, leave no room for doubt that, in the event of their failure to secure byprocess&apos;of negotiation the establishment of a Jewish State, the extreme Zionistscontemplate the use of armed force for the attainment of their objectives. Theyhave already large quantities of illegal arms.  What they need is training.7. We are therefore faced with a dilemma. On the one hand, there is astrong case for an immediate increase subject to the limitations inevitablyimposed by the lack of arms and equipment in the recruitment of PalestinianJews for military service and for the expansion of the various Jewish policeorganisations for functions analogous to those performed by a Home Guard. Onthe other, we must have regard to the dangers of the political side to which theMinister of State has drawn attention that are likely to ensue from any considerable accession to Jewish armed and trained strength in Palestine underirresponsible leadership.8. At our request the situation was reviewed at a conference at Cairo lastweek between the Minister of State, the High Commissioner for Palestine, theChief of the General Staff, Middle East, and General Scobie. (Copies of recenttelegraphic correspondence between the War Office, the Minister of State, andthe Commander-in-Chief, Middle East,&quot; are attached in the Appendix to this paper.) There was general agreement that the fullest possible use of Jewishman-power should be made provided that it is directed into channels that help to win the war, but that it was essential that the British authorities, and not theJewish Agency, should be the best judges of the means and methods to beemployed and of the uses to which the available man-power is to be put and thatthey should retain full and effective control of the bodies who are enlisted. they considered that the best way to meet the Jewish demands for service in so faras they are legitimate and justifiable would be (a) to accept, if forthcoming, the offer of the Jewish Agency, of an additional10,000 recruits for the Palestinian Buffs and ancillary services of theBritish Army, and to absorb these recruits at the rate of 500 a month.Further, that a previous proposal to form a Palestinian Regiment outof the existing Companies of the Buffs (and those to be raised infuture) should now be proceeded with;(b) to expand the Palestine Volunteer Force, now only 410 strong, which is open to British, Jews and Arabs alike, provided that an adequate supply of arms and equipment can be made available;
(c) to complete the establishment of the Jewish Rural Special Police, by theenrolment of 1,500 additional recruits, the Commander-in-Chiefundertaking to provide the training staff and co-ordinating officers for this considerable addition to the existing force; but to resist theJewish demand for the recruitment of up to 10,000 additional part-time Jewish Urban Special Police for active defence.In the case of both (b) and (c), tJhe Commander-in-Chief has urged that armsand equipment should be sent out specially from this country as soon as possible.9. We have considered these views and our recommendations are briefly asfollows : (a) Additional recruits for the infantry units and ancillary services shouldbe accepted &quot;p to 10,000, but in our view the time has now.come forthe creation of a Palestinian Regiment of the British Army, consistingof separate Jewish and Arab battalions and for the incorporation inthe new Regiment of the existing Palestinian Companies of the Buffs;the insignia of the Regiment being limited to a regimental crest andthe scroll &quot; Palestine Regiment &quot; which would be common to Jewishand Arab Battalions alike. But Lord Cranborne considers that, ifthis is done, it is important that Zionist grievances arising from thefunctions and duties assigned to the Palestinian Buffs should beremoved in the case of the Palestine Regiment. The new unit shouldbe engaged as an active combatant force in military operations andshould not be employed, as the companies of the Buffs now are, purelyon guard duties and the defence of vulnerable points. This restriction of functions is regarded as humiliating by young Jews who are anxiousto fight Hitler. The Regimental and Battalion Headquarters shouldnot therefore be organised merely for administration and training.Equality in the number of Jewish and Arab Battalions to beraised should not be insisted on.(b) The expansion of the Palestine Volunteer Force up to (say) 2,000 shouldbe proceeded with to the extent that arms and equipment can beprovided.(c) The establishment of the Jewish Rural Special Police should be completed by the recruitment of 1,500 additional men. The War Office confirm the Commander-in-Chief&apos;s view that&apos;arms and equipment will haveto be despatched from this country, as the arming and equippingof these forces could be provided from Middle East sources only at theexpense of regular units.10. As regards the recruitment of up to 10,000 part-time Jewish urbanspecial police, the authorities at Cairo point out that these would not be drawn from surplus man-power; they would be men already engaged in industry whowould have to receive part-time training, and they would be neither soldiers norpolice but merely armed civilians. The view of the&quot; Minister of State&apos;s conference was that the plan would be both insidious and dangerous : the addition of a large body of part-time urban Specials would not be of the slightest value to the Armyand might indeed add seriously to its commitments. It would be more difficult for the Army and impossible for the Police to find instructors or equipment. Itwould be impossible to control them and they would constitute a grave politicalmenace to internal security as they would look to the Jewish Agency, who control the &quot; Hagana &quot; the illegal Zionist military organisation as the real directors.11. We feel that there is force in this argument, and that it would not be advisable to overset the combined judgment of the men on the spot at this criticalstage of the Battle for Egypt. We agree with the view of the Conference thatthe really urgent matter is to concentrate on the formation of the PalestineRegiment, the expansion of the Palestine Volunteer Force, and the completion ofthe establishments and the training and arming of existing organisations, eg.,the Palestine Volunteer Force and the Jewish Rural Special Police.12.   If the War Cabinet approve of these proposals, the necessary intimationwill be sent at once to the Minister of State, the Commander-in-Chiei&quot; and theHigh Commissioner for Palestine, and a public announcement will have to be[24178] B 2
made immediately. The Commander-in-Chief has already been consulted as tothe terms of the announcement. As his intention is that the role of the battalions of the Palestine Regiment will be the same as that of the Palestinian InfantryCompanies of the Buffs, viz., defence of vulnerable points and provision of localmobile forces, he urges that the announcement should state explicitly that these will be the functions of the Regiment and that it would be inadvisable to raisefalse hopes in Zionist circles that their original, more grandiose, proposal for aRegiment of all arms is being accepted. This course would involve us in diffi-culties with the Jewish Agency when they discovered our real intentions asregards the role which the Regiment is to play.On the other hand, for the reasons given in paragraph 9 (a) above, LordCranborne is averse from an explicit statement that the duties of the Regimentwill be the same as those of the Palestinian Infantry Companies and thatequipment suitable for this type of employment only will be provided. Nor doeshe see why the question whether the battalions should be capable of fighting ininfantry brigades need be prejudged now. But, if the Regiment cannot be usedfor active combatant duties, Lord Cranborne feels that the announcement should avoid a detailed explanation of its duties and that it would be preferable merely to state that it is being created &quot; for general service in the Middle East.&quot;13. It is provisionally suggested that the announcement should be on thefollowing lines : His Majesty&apos;s Government have recently had under review the adequacy ofthe existing arrangements for affording all sections of the community in palestine the opportunity they desire to defend their country against a possible attack bythe Axis forces. They have come to the conclusion that the following further measures to strengthen the defences of the country should now be adopted : (1) (// Lord Cranborn&amp;s vieiu as stated in paragraph 12 is accepted.) &quot; APalestine Regiment of the British Army will be created at once,consisting of separate Jewish and Arab Infantry Battalions forgeneral service in the Middle East. Normally the Regiment will beemployed in Palestine or adjacent countries for the defence ofPalestine. The existing Palestinian Companies of the Buffs will be incorporated into the Regiment and it is hoped to obtain at least10,000 additional recruits for it.&quot;(Alternatively, if the Commander-in-Chiefs view is accepted)&apos;&apos; A Palestine Regiment of the British Army will be created at once,consisting of separate Jewish and Arab Infantry Battalions forgeneral service in the Middle East. The role of these battalions willbe the same as that of the existing Palestine companies of the Buffs,viz., defence of vulnerable points and provision of local mobile forces.The Regiment will be organised and provided with equipment suitablefor this employment. Enlistment will be for general service, butnormally units will be employed in Palestine or adjacent countries forthe defence of Palestine. The existing Palestinian companies of theBuffs will be incorporated into the Regiment, and it is hoped to obtainat least 10,000 additional recruits for it.(2) &quot; The Palestine Volunteer Force, recruitment for which is open to all sections of the community, will be expanded to a maximum of 2,000as arms, equipment and training facilities can be made available.(3) &apos;&apos; The establishment of the Jewish Rural Special Police will be completed by the enrolment of 1,500 additional recruits, requisite training staff and co-ordination officers, arms and equipment to be provided by theCommander-in-Chief, Middle East, as soon as circumstances permit.(4) &apos;&apos; In addition, the training and equipment of existing units will becontinued as rapidly as possible.&quot;P.

APPENDIX.Telegram from the War Office to the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, dated july 16, 1942.(51539.)Following, Personal, from Secretary of State for War for Minister ofState : Reference 99868 (M.0.5) of 7th July to Commander-in-Chief andMacMichaeFs 858 of&apos;8th July and 882 of 10th July to Secretary of StateColonies.  Cranborne proposes instruct MacMichael as follows : 1. To recruit Jewish urban special police up to 10,000 for active defence and begin training pending supply of arms and equipment; extend scheme toArab urban areas also if expedient and response likely.2.   Recruit 1,500 Jewish rural special police to complete establishment.3. Training of new and existing formations to be simultaneous and onincreased scale, including instructors&apos; courses.4. Commander-in-Chief to be asked to provide urgently training staff andco-ordinating officers.5. Equipment to be provided on following priority: trained soldiers(Poles, Greeks, &amp;c); rural police and Volunteer Force; urban police. realised that proposals involve certain risks, but considered that these must be taken toenable Jews defend homes if situation requires.   Proposals end.Army&apos;s share of responsibility is provision of instructors, training andequipment. Recognise difficulty of providing full equipment at present time,but in the view of the Government all such steps as are practicable should betaken as and when circumstances permit. I do not know whether some such orderof priority as above is possible, but Cranborne attaches great importance to it andso I should be glad of your early views on this aspect. In any case, I should beglad if Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, could provide training personnelforthwith.You will be aware of pressure in America and here regarding Jewish Army.In view of Government&apos;s decision not to agree to this proposal and of new situa-tion in Middle East, it is important to take some steps to give effect to thesealternative proposals.Please consider urgently and advise Cranborne and me of your views.Telegram from Minister of State, Cairo, to Foreign Office, dated July 21, 1942.(1097.)Following from Minister of State : Private and personal to Secretary of State for War.I held a meeting at which Sir H. MacMichael, Chief of the General Staff,General Scobie, and officers of my staff were present to consider your telegramNo. 51539.1.   Your paragraph 1.  See my later remarks on Jewish urban police.Your paragraph 2. We agree, but see paragraph 4 of High Commissioner&apos;telegram No. 858 regarding the need not to prejudice food production in rural areas.Your paragraphs 3, 4 and 5. Commander-in-Chief will undertake to pro-vide training of staff and co-ordinating officers for 15.000 Jewish rural specialpolice. Commander-in-Chief is also in favour of expansion of PalestinianVolunteer Force, but this expansion is undesirable except to the extent that armsand equipment can be provided for the Force. Commander-in-Chief urges thatthese arms and equipment should, be specially sent out as soon as possible. If this can be done a substantial increase in the Force of up to, say, 2,000, or such lessnumber as can be armed would be practicable. Arms and equipment should alsobe sent for rural special police. The arms position is well known to the WarOffice, who will confirm that arms and equipment for these special forces couldonly be provided from Middle East sources at the expense of regular units.
2. I pass now to the proposal to recruit up to 10,000 part-time Jewish urbanspecial police for &quot; active defence &quot; and to begin training them (extension of this to the Arab urban areas would certainly be inexpedient and response unlikely).It is, of course, realised that these urban specials (whom the Jews style &quot; FightingReserve &quot;) would not be surplus man-power. They are men already engaged in industry who would be given part-time training. They would be neither soldiersnor police, but merely armed civilians..3. I take the view, which is shared by military authorities and HighCommissioner, that this proposal is an insidious and dangerous one. What is actually needed is (a) more full-time recruits for the Buffs and Services, both of which areshort, though recruiting has been better lately (between 400 and 500for each of the last two weeks, as compared with between 100 and 200and 300 in previous weeks and less than 100 in the first three weeks of May. In every case great majority have preferred to join theServices and only comparatively few the Buffs);(b) to complete establishment and training and arming of existing enlist-ments  [group undecypherable:   ? such as] the police, PalestinianVolunteers).4. Addition [ ? group omitted : of ] a large body of part-time urban special constables would not be the slightest value to the army and might, indeed, addseriously to its commitments. It would be most difficult for the army, and quite impossible for the police, to find instructors or equipment for them. It wouldalso be impossible to control them, and they would constitute a grave politicalmenace to internal security in view of the fact that they would look to the agency and those who control Hagana as their real directors. They would not be at thefull disposal of the military authorities at all times for whatever purposes theywere required, but would choose their own role, and their choice would be deter-mined by the political considerations which actuated their real masters. Arabs,of course, are perfectly well aware of these facts and are naturally suspicious andresentful, though at present behaving well, and, indeed, showing increased support as the menace draws nearer, but. in the view of us ail, direct danger to internal security is quite as great, if not greater, from the Jews as from the Arabs, forthe Jews are being whipped up by their controlling bodies into the conviction thatthey must prepare themselves to resist not only the Germans but equally the arabs and the British.5. In the existing state of affairs, i.e., while the German thrust is still someway off, the position is that to train these urban specials would not serve any useful purpose and might indeed engender or enhance a grave danger. In thecircumstances of German advance into Palestine and in the event of withdrawalof our armies the existence of 10,000 part-time urban specials would obviously beno sort of safeguard to National Home or to individual Jews and might even be a danger to the Jews by inviting reprisals. It might be said that in an inter-regnum period before the arrival of the Germans the Jews would be in dangerfrom the Arabs. This is not so. In fact, the Jews are already secretly so wellarmed and organised that they wrould be in no danger at all from the Arabs.Once the Germans had arrived no residudl [group undecypherable: ? Jewish&apos;]force, even if it were armed, could have any effect on events.6. We are all equally anxious to make fullest possible use of Jewish man-power provided it is directed into channels that help to win the war, but it issurely cardinal that we and not the Agency must (a) be the best judges of the means and methods to be employed and of theuses to which the available man-powrer is to be put;(b) retain full and effective control of the bodies who are enlisted.7. For obvious reasons we here are strongly of the opinion that the proposalto raise some thousands of part-time special police is unwise. We consider thebest way to meet additional Jewish demand for service in so far as it is legitimateand justifiable would be, as suggested above -(a) to accept, if forthcoming, the offer of Jewish Agency of an additional   .10,000 recruits for Palestine Buffs ancillary services in the british army. These recruits could be absorbed at the rate of 500 per mensem.The proposal for the formation of a Palestine regiment of Buffs on thelines previously agreed should also be proceeded with;
Telegram from the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, to the War Office,dated July 22, 1942.(Al/26731.)Your 99868 (M.O. 5) 7/7, last sentence, about formation Palestine Regiment.1. Strongly urge you reconsider decision not to proceed formation thisregiment for following reasons: (a) Grouping of companies becoming increasingly necessary for operational and administrative reasons, especially asrecruiting is going well and will probably improve further, (b) Even in formproposed by us its formation will be political gesture which should be of value.2. Now wish power to depart from original proposal of equality in numberof Jew and Arab Battalions.   This is necessary for reasons as in 1 (a).3.   Minister of State cabling separately to Secretary of State for War.Telegram from the War Office to the Cmmander-in-Chief-, Middle East, dated july 30, 1942. .(54758.)Reference your Al/26731 of 22/7 and 1097 of 21/7 from Minister ofState to Secretary of State for War. Draft paper now being preparedfor earliest consideration Cabinet accepting formation Palestine regiment and including, subiect vour agreement, following- as statement for uublicannouncement: &quot; Palestine regiment of the British Army will be created at onceconsisting of separate Jewish and Arab battalions for general service in middle East.&quot;Do you agree above statement, which would cover possible employment ofPalestine regiment for combatant duties inside or outside Palestine ? Reply mostimmediate.Telegram from the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, to the War Office, dated july 31, 1942.(Al/30323.)Your 54758 (M.O. 5), 30th July.Consider that proposed public statement is too.brief and will raise falsehopes in Zionist circles that their original more grandiose proposal of regimentof all arms is being accepted, and therefore involve us in continual difficulties,when Jewish Agency, &amp;c, discover what we are going to do.2.   Suggest following public statement: &quot; Palestine Regiment of the British Army will be created at once,consisting of separate Jewish and Arab Infantry Battalions for general service in Mideast. Role of these battalions will be same as that of existingPalestine companies of the Buffs, viz., defence of vulnerable points, and provision of local mobile forces. Regiment will be organised and provided with equipment suitable for this employment. Enlistment for general service, but normally units will be employed in Palestine or adjacent&quot;countries, for defence of Palestine.&quot;(b) there will be expansion of Palestine Volunteer Force as proposed inparagraph 1 above. This Force is open to British, Jews and Arabsalike;(c) to complete the establishment of Jewish Rural Special Police recruiting of 1,500 as proposed in paragraph 1 above.Above proposals would not permit of Jews directing the forces concerned,Jewish flags and insignia or Jewish political objectives, and therein lies theirsafety.
