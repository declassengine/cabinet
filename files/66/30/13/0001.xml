Memorandum by the Minister of Defence.1. Pearl Harbour and the entry of the United States into the war on one side, while Japan broke out upon us on the other, opened an entirely new phase of the war. I proceeded with professional advisers to Washington in order to concert future action with President Roosevelt. We were all agreed that the overthrow of Hitler was the prime objective, both in magnitude and in time,and that Japan must be held as far as possible until the defeat of Germany andItaly enabled our whole force to be turned upon her.2. At this time the President showed himself already deeply interested inthe plan for American intervention in French North Africa by landings at casablanca or Tangier. This operation was called &quot;Gymnast.&quot; general auchinleck was then advancing towards Benghazi and Agedabia and we had thehope that his operation, called &quot; Crusader,&quot; would be followed by &quot;Acrobat,&quot;namely the advance of our Desert Army to Tripoli. &quot; Gymnast &quot; was exploredat Washington but before any definite decision could be taken general auchinleck&apos;s forces were thrown back to the Gazala position. All prospects of&quot;Acrobat&quot; were closed and &quot;Gymnast&quot; faded a good deal. However, boththe President and I continued to regard it as the main and most attractive formof the first American impact upon the Western theatre of war.[24533]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.

3. In April 1942, General Marshall came over to England with a plan fora mass invasion of the Continent by Anglo-American forces in April 1943. TheDefence Committee were in complete agreement with this conception of a greatcampaign for the liberation of Europe. For this there were solid arguments.The British Isles are the best assembly point for a great mass of american troops and have already a considerable British Army. The Pas de Calais is theonly place where the whole power of the British Metropolitan Air Force, whichmust in any case be located here with any American accessions, can be thrownimmediately and directly into the conflict. On the other hand, the enemy knowthis, and have concentrated very strong air and ground forces in this area, andfortified it with the utmost care. The tides and beaches are unfavourable, the portsshallow and mined or destroyed. General MarshalEs plan also contemplated a landing from England into Northern France in 1942 while Germany was busy inRussia. The shortage of landing craft in 1942 made this smaller operationextremely doubtful. Nevertheless, we agreed with General Marshall that weshould proceed with plans for the seizing in 1942 of bridgeheads (&quot;&apos; Sledge-hammer &quot;) as a preliminary for 1943. and anyhow for a great assault on theContinent in 1943. The name of the main operation is &apos;; Roundup.&quot;&apos; and theadministrative preparation, which is vast in extent, is called &quot; Bolero.&quot;4. It soon became apparent that the 1942 operation would have littlechances of success, unless the Germans were completely demoralised and virtuallyin collapse, observing that it would have to be either an assault on the Pas deCalais, where the enemy is strongest and conditions are most adverse, or.alternatively, an opposed landing at some point outside air cover. Personally I&quot;was sure that the newly raised United States formations, as well as our ownsomewhat more matured forces, could not establish themselves on the french coast, still less advance far inland, in the teeth of well-organised Germanopposition.5. - Accordingly, I went to Washington in June 1942 and expressed these doubts to the President and General Marshall. I also enlarged on the possi-bilities of &quot; Gymnast &quot; and pressed that it should be explored carefully andconscientiously. In deference to the American reluctance to abandon&quot; Sledgehammer.&quot; it was agreed that further resolute efforts should be made to overcome the obvious dangers and difficulties of the enterprise, and that, if a sound and sensible plan could be contrived, we should not hesitate to give effectto it. It was also agreed that, as an alternative for 1942. the &quot; Gymnast &quot; plan should be completed in all details as soon as possible. In the above, I was guided by the advice of our expert authorities, and sustained by the opinion of mycolleagues in the War Cabinet.6. On my return to England our further studies convinced us that&apos;: Sledgehammer &quot; held out no prospects of success. Accordingly, general marshall and Admiral King came to London at our invitation towards the endof July for the second London Conference. We all unitedly dissuaded them from&quot; Sledgehammer &quot; in 1942 (about which they were beginning to feel uneasy).
while urging that general preparation on a large scale for &quot; Roundup &quot; shouldcontinue. As an alternative to *&apos; Sledgehammer,&quot; we begged them to throw their whole weight into an enlarged &quot; Gymnast &quot; as our 1942 operation. After longdiscussions, which are in my colleagues&apos; memory, complete agreement was reached between all authorities, British and American, political and military. Since thenpreparations have gone forward without ceasing, both for &quot; Gymnast.&quot; whichAvas rechristened &quot; Torch,&quot; and through &quot; Bolero,&quot; for the building up of&apos;; Roundup,&quot; though at a much later date in 1943 than April.7. The Russians meanwhile, completely ignorant of amphibious warfare andwilfully closing their eyes to the German strength on the French northern coast,continued to clamour for &quot; a second front in Europe.&quot; On this we have protectedourselves by written declarations from all reproach of breach of faith. M. Molotovknew when he returned to Russia in June exactly how we stood about invadingNorthern France.8. In order to convince our Russian ally that we had in no way brokenfaith to him, and to persuade him of the virtues of &quot; Torch &quot; (which nowincluded action inside the Mediterranean), I went to Moscow in the middle ofAugust where everything was plainly and even brutally explained. M. Stalin,while expressing dissatisfaction at the aid we were giving to Russia, was in myopinion convinced of what he called &quot; the military correctness &quot; of &quot; Torch.&apos;- So- much for the past.9. People say there ought to be a comprehensive plan of the war as a whole,and that all the United Nations ought to participate in it. There has always been on our part, since the United States entry, a perfectly clear view. I have nevervaried on the main points. We have at length got a large measure of agreement and co-operation from the United States. Everything is now moving forwardinto action. Our plan is in the first place &quot; Torch,&quot; with its forerunner &quot; Light-foot.&quot; The success of these operations will dictate our main action in 1943. Notonly shall we open a route under air protection through the Mediterranean, butwe shall also be in a position to attack the under-belly of the Axis at whatever may be the softest point, i.e., Sicily, Southern Italy or perhaps Sardinia; oragain, if circumstances warrant, or as they may do, compel, the French Rivieraor perhaps even, with Turkish aid, the Balkans. However this may turn out. andit is silly to try to peer too far ahead, our war from now on till the summer of1943 will be waged in the Mediterranean theatre.10. It will still be necessary to maintain a strong Army in Great Britainand to insist upon adequate United States reinforcements being assembled here.&quot; Bolero &quot; must continue at full blast, and we must persuade the Americans notto discard &quot; Roundup,&quot; albeit much retarded. Thus we shall have in GreatBritain ample troops to defend the Island against a German invasion and to pinclown large forces on the northern coast of France. We shall also be ready totake advantage of a German collapse. In any case Ave should have a mass oftroops in Great Britain ready to move to the Mediterranean theatre, or evenpossibly to the Arctic (&quot; Jupiter &quot;).
11. All these matters have been sedulously thrashed out by the Chiefs ofStaff, the Defence Committee and the War Cabinet, and I have heard of no difference in principle amongst them.12. There preys upon us as the greatest danger to the United Nations,and particularly to&quot;our Island, the U-boat attack. The Navy call for greaterassistance from the Air. T am proposing to my colleagues that we try for thepresent to obtain this extra assistance mainly from the United States, and thatwe encroach as little as possible upon our Bomber effort against Germany, whichis of peculiar importance during these winter months. I have, on the contrary,asked for an increase in the Bomber effort, rising to 50 squadrons by the end ofthe year. Thereafter our bombing power will increase through the maturing ofproduction. It may be that early in 1943 we shall have to damp down the Bomberoffensive against Germany in order to meet the stress and peril of the U-boat war.I hope and trust not, but by then it will be possible at any rate to peg our bomber offensive at a higher level than at present. The issue is not one ofprinciple, but of emphasis. At present, in spite of U-boat losses, the Bomberoffensive should have first place in our air effort.13. To sum up. our policy remains unaltered. Germany is the primeobjective and Japan must be held.   Our tasks are these :  (1) To preserve the United Kingdom and our communications.(2) &quot; Lightfoot&apos;* and &quot;Torch,&quot;&apos; and their exploitation.(3) &apos;; Bolero,&quot; for a retarded but still paramount &quot; Roundup.&apos;&quot;(4) The Bomber offensive against Germany, minus any inroads that may haveto be made upon it next year in order to meet the U-boat menace.(5) Supplies to Russia by the Arctic route, with the possibility of &quot; Jupiter &quot;always borne in mind should the Russians offer a major contributionto it.(6) The gathering of air and land forces south of Turkey and the Caspian,capable of either sustaining the Southern Russian flank and/orinfluencing Turkey, or. alternatively, if things go badly, defendingPersia, Syria, Iraq and Palestine.(7) Subject to prior claims, preparing for an attack on the Japanesecommunications via the Burma Road, by the recovery of Burma.14. There are many minor but still important matters which should be mentioned in any complete review. But what is set down here is surelyquite enough.W. .S. C.October 24, 1942.
