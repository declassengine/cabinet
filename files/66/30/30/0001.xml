Draft of The King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.Tuesday. November 10, 1942.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons.During the past year the forces fighting for honour and freedom throughoutthe world have gained a most notable accession of strength. JapanJs treacherousand unprovoked assault has spread the conflict of war throughout the EasternHemisphere; and has brought fresh danger to My peoples in Asia and in the pacific. But this extension of the war has brought to our side, as comrades in arms, the,grea* United States of America, who had already long sustained theAllied Cause by their sympathy and material aid, and has also brought Me into a close alliance with the Republic of China, which has so long and so gallantlyresisted the aggression of Japan.I welcome too as Allies in the great battle for freedom those other american republics which have joined the United Nations, and I am gratified that yetothers have severed their diplomatic relations with the enemy Powers.I share to the full the admiration of My people for the glorious feats of arms of the Soviet forces. In the defence of Stalingrad, which has been a hard blowstruck at our enemies, a new chapter of heroism has been written in the annalsof war. My Government and My people are determined to do their utmost toassist our Soviet Allies, both by the supply of materials of war and by offensive action against the common foe.On New Year&apos;s Day 1942 My Government signed a Joint Declarationendorsing the principles embodied in the Atlantic Charter and pledged them-selves to devote, in common with their Allies, their full resources to the defeat ofthe Axis Powers. To-day a great company of nations are united in their deter-mination to win victory; and their support gives to Me and to My people freshencouragement in the struggle in which we have been engaged for more than threeyears.The relations between My people and those of the United States of Americaare becoming ever closer. Since this Parliament was opened. My Prime minister in the JJjme^d^Kingdom has twice crossed the Atlantic to visit Washington andOttawa, and the generous&quot; welcome &apos;exten^d&quot;d:o&quot; llirT^K*y the President and thepeople of the United States of America^has affoixlea Me and My people thegreatest pleasure. The work of the Conminecl Staff and the Combined Boardsestablished in Washington and London has already gone far to perfect the mutual assistance between the two countries and to make more effective the organisationof our common offensive against the enemy.We have enjoyed with profound satisfaction the privilege of welcomingMrs. Roosevelt among us. I welcome, too, the presence in this country/ of thesoldiers, sailors and airmen of our American Allies, a happy augury of the greatoffensive strength which they are building up in their own country.On-the 26th May I concluded with the Presidium of the Supreme Council ofthe U.S.S.R. a new Treaty of Alliance in the war against Hitlerite Germany and her associates in Europe. This Treaty also provides for post-war collaboration with the Soviet Union and for mutual assistance against aggression.The welcome visit of the Soviet People&apos;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs tothis country and to the United States of America, following on the visit of MyForeign Secretary to Moscow, together with the visit of My Prime Minister ofthe United Kingdom accompanied by a special envoy of President Roosevelt toMr. Stalin in August last, provided an opportunity for far-reaching discussions on the general conduct of the war by the three Allies.My Government in the United Kingdom have offered to the Chinese Govern-ment a Treaty for the relinquishment of extra-territorial jurisdiction in China.The close collaboration of the Government of the United States of America inthis matter will be a source of special satisfaction to My people. The offer of this treaty is an earnest of the close and equal collaboration which I am confidentwill regulate My relations with My g-teat Chinese Ally in the future.  I am glad
that in these difficult times for the Chinese people you have been able to send a delegation of your members to Chungking to assure them of the goodwill and determined support which My peoples will always give them.It has been a great pleasure to me to welcome to this country My PrimeMinister of the Union of South Africa. His participation at this time in thediscussions and decisions of My Government here will prove of great value.Many other of My Ministers and Counsellors have also come to this country Vduring the year from My Dominions and from India for the purpose of conferringwith My Government here. The cordial friendship existing between all MyGovernments has been a great factor in forwarding the war effort of all my people.My Government in the United Kingdom have expressed to the peoples of\India the hope that they will enter fully into free and independent partnership \l j/\within the British Commonwealth of Nations.   Immediately hostilities have ceased the Indian peoples will have an opportunity  to  frame  their own J      /Constitution as an essential first step towards that partnership.   In the meantime    ./they   were invited through their leaders to play a full part in the government of -their country. I regret profoundly that hitherto they have not been willing toaccept this offer. I sincerely hope that wiser counsels may prevail, and that aspeedy and successful solution to these difficulties may be brought about through a wider measure of agreement amongst the Indian people-1 themselves.All My peoples have met with courage and endurance the increasing callsupon their services both for the armed forces and for the great productionindustries. Particularly remarkable during the last year has been the responseof the great numbers of women who have entered bwt?h-the Services and civil employment and who/nave shown a high,degree of skill and devotion in their work.The extension/lsion of the war to the take ; East created; problems of^re^^d^ffl^Eftty ^^son^ceT^S^^SI^^rairied To^he&quot;xitmo&amp;t,--de^pite thesupport of-My/Allies.

I was happy to award the George Cross to this gallantIsland which, by its long continued bravery and resistance, has played so noblea part in the battles of the Middle East.My Navy has been compelled by the extension of the Avar and the growth of the submarine and air menace to shipping, to extend its protection over an ever-widening area of the oceans. Aided by its auxiliaries and by the fishing-fleet, it has succeeded, thanks to the bravery and endurance of My officers andmen, in what might well have seemed an impossible task. My gallant merchant seamen and the merchant seamen of the United Nations have shown the greatestcourage and determination in maintaining a flow of supplies through all theperils of sea and air to our Soviet Allies, to our forces in the Mediterranean andto other theatres of war, while at the same time maintaining the essential supplies of food and raw materials to this country.My Army is at this moment engaged in heavy fighting with the enemy inthe Western Desert, and I join with you and with My people in sending ourheartfelt wishes for a speedy victory to our gallant men. Throughout the year,training and preparation has gone forward in this country to enable us to strike at the enemy at the earliest practicable moment. Those officers and men whoare compelled to remain in this country, despite their anxious wish to get togrips with the enemy, are playing an important role both in our defence and inthe preparation for attack. Upon them and upon their high morale we shalldepend for our victory in the future.My Indian Army is growing in strength month by month, and has displayedits historic valour upon many fields of battle in Africa and the Middle East.We are proud that more than a million men have already voluntarily engagedin our Indian land, sea and air forces; and we place our full confidence in theircourage and fortitude in the days of struggle that lie before them.[24565]B 2
-r-My Air Force has added fresh achievements to its already g-petrt- record.It dominates the air over this Island and over the North of France. In everyencounter it has proved its ascendancy over our enemies. In close co-operationwith My Navy and My Army it has taken an increasing part in our campaigns,both by sea and by land in all theatres of war;-and has carried the offensivewith ever-increasing weight and strength into Germany and Italy, devastatingtheir factories and disrupting their transport.The strength of My Armed Forces in the Dominions is continually increasing,and they have shown by sea, land and air their courage and resolution in the face of the common enemy.In their encounters with the enemy, My Navy, Army and Air Force have fought side by side with the Allied Forces; both those of the United States, nowgathering in strength month by month, and those of My other Allies, undauntedby the overrunning of their homelands.In those countries now occupied by the enemy Powers and subjected to everyform of oppression, starvation and savagery, the ever-growing tide of resistancebrings courage and inspiration to all who are determined to see freedomestablished in the world. It is the firm and unchangeable purpose of My peoples and of our Allies, not only to defend the cause of freedom wherever it may be attacked, but to carry the war into enemy territory so that we may liberate asspeedilv as lies in our power those countries and peoples now under /dominationbyYou have carried on your task through times of difficulty and of stress as members of a free Parliament and, by your unswerving determination to maintainthose free institutions which have been built up in this our country, you havegiven an example to all the world of the value and strength of our Democracy.Members of the House of Commons :I thank you for the provision that you have made towards the cost of thewar. The enormous expenditure which is necessary to carry the war to a successful conclusion continues to be met by the efforts of My people both byway of taxation and by their readiness to put their savings at the disposal ofthe State.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :Once again, thanks to the great efforts of the whole agricultural community and of our seamen, the food supplies essential for My people have been assured.Our assent has been given to an Act making possible an increased degreeof mobilisation of the man and woman power of the country. Almost the entireman and woman power of our country is now mobilised, and we must rely uponthe constant and continuous drive for efficiency and economy in manpower andmaterial to increase the production of arms and supplies which are essential if My Armed Forces are to be victorious over the enemy.I, with you, thank Almighty God for having brought us through this year of peril and anxiety, and I pray that His Blessing may attend you at all times.
Draft of The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.



WEDNESDAY, 11TH NOVEMBER, 1942.



MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS:



In this fourth year of war My Peoples look forward with unshakable courage. They are determined to fight on to victory, with no thought of parley with the enemy. Whatever the future may hold, I know that they will respond wholeheartedly to every new demand made upon them.

I look with gratitude and pride upon the great and ever-growing war effort of My loyal subjects. Their comradeship and unity in war will be an inspiration and source of power in the years to come.

My Forces by sea, land and air continue to meet with courage and devotion the calls which the extension of the war has made upon their resources. Aided by the powerful support of the Armed Forces of My Allies and sustained by the growing output of our munition factories, they are now bringing an increasing weight of attack against the enemy.

The declaration of the United Nations endorsing the principles of the Atlantic Charter provides a foundation on which international society can be rebuilt after the war. As a first step My Government have entered into the consultation with the Governments of the United Nations in preparation for the urgent needs which will arise when they regain their freedom. When the time comes, these tasks will, I am confident, be faced with the same spirit of comradeship and resolution as have been shown in the war.

My Government desire to do their utmost to raise the standards and to improve the conditions of My Peoples in the Colonies, who are playing their full part in the United War effort.



MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS:



You will be asked to make further financial provision for the conduct of the war and for the other necessary services.

MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS:

My Government&apos;s first concern must be to seek and secure the means of achieving complete and speedy victory; and they will put before you such proposals for emergency legislation as may be necessary for the effective prosecution of the war or for meeting conditions arising out of the war. You will be asked to pass legislation with respect to war damage suffered by public utility undertakings.

A start has, however, been made in working out the measures which will be necessary when peace comes. My Government have already received and are examining Reports upon compensation and betterment in respect of land values and upon land utilisation in rural areas. Renewed consideration to the position of Old Age and Widowed Pensioners further measures before you.

Conversations are taking place between My Ministers and others concerned with the provision and conduct of education in England and Wales with a view to see a way upon the improvements
necessary for the better education of My people, ^he system of education in(Scotland is also under review^ As a yesult of.........these-diseussions My Ministershope to lay proposals for legislation before you.My Ministers will continue to take all practicable measures to promote the health and well-being of My people in war-time by securing the better care of young children, by the prevention of disease, by the treatment of the sick andby the alleviation wherever possible of the housing difficulties consequent uponthe war.Our enemies yet remain powerful and we can look forward to no easy task.All our fortitude and all our determination will be needed to win through tovictory. But I know that nothing will shake your purpose or cause your stepsto falter on the way.I pray that the Almighty may give His blessing to your counsels.
