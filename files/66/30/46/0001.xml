Obviously, any decisions that we may come to in the field of foreign policy can only be provisional,for no one can foretell the future shape of international relationships. Never-theless, the absence of any guiding principle is a source of weakness in ourday to day conduct of the war. I have very little doubt that an important element in our difficulties with the Russians is the suspicions which they entertain ofour ultimate intentions towards them. I have no doubt that they suspect that we and the Americans would be glad to see them permanently weakened by thewar and permanently sterilised as a world influence. The Americans, on their side, are suspicious not so much of our ability as of our determination to shoulderwide responsibilities, whether in Europe or in the oceanic world outside ofEurope. And the smaller Allies are puzzled by an apparent inability on our part to give them the kind of lead, to provide for them the kind of focus, whichthey have come to realise that they must have if they are to survive in a europe which will continue to be overshadowed, in numbers, in industry and inintelligence, even by a defeated Germany. I regard it as essential, therefore,that we should clarify our own minds on these matters. It is obviously premature to attempt to chart, in any detail, the course wdiich we intend to follow. Thetime has come, nevertheless, when we should take a bearing. If we do not do soI am very much afraid that the obscure forces of separation and isolation, which to a greater or less extent are working behind the scenes in Russia, in Americaand even in this country, will be encouraged, and the mutual suspicions as betweenally and ally which they engender will be communicated to those on whom themaintenance of the struggle principally rests. Accordingly, I would ask theapproval of my colleagues for the general line of policy which I have sketchedin this paper.2. I assume that the aim of British policy must be, first, that we shouldcontinue to exercise the functions and to bear the responsibilities of a worldPower; and, secondly, that we should seek not only to free Europe, but to preserveher freedom. Here in Europe, after all, is the cradle, and until recently thehome, of the civilisation which has now spread to almost every corner of theglobe. Here, too, we have to live, a few miles from the Continent. We cannot afford a Europe unfriendly to our interests or antagonistic to our way of life.We cannot afford a Europe which is dominated by Germany.3. For my part I do not think it is possible seriously to dispute these twoobjectives. We have to maintain our position as an Empire and a Commonwealth.If we fail to clo so we cannot exist as a world Power. And we have to accept our full share of responsibility for the future of Europe. If we fail to do thatwe shall have fought this war to no purpose, and the mastery of Europe whichwe have refused to Germany by force of arms will pass to her by naturalsuccession as soon as the control of our arms is removed. For it is inconceivable11893   [24597]
that the smaller European States, either singly or in eo-operation, will be able by themselves to resist the pull of a populous, industrious and highly organised Statelike Germany. The Allied Governments, themselves, are conscious of the extentto which they will have to rely in the future upon this country. If we are unwilling to accept from them the leadership which they offer us they will haveto offer it elsewhere. And the time will inevitably come when they will drift intothe orbit of the only Power which can offer them the economic security thatthey seek.4. If it is agreed that these are our objectives, how are they to be realised ?It will be admitted, I think, that we cannot realise them through our own unaidedefforts. We can only hope to play our part either as a European Power or as a world Power if we ourselves form part of a wider organisation. It is impossibleto say wdiether the League of Nations can ever be revived in anything like itsold form, or even whether we would wish to see it revived as it -was. Certainlywe should make every effort to preserve those technical and humanitarian servicesof the League which have been conspicuously successful in the past and for whichthere will still be scope in the future. But in the meantime, at any rate, we havethe conception of the United Nations, a conception at once less ambitious andmore practical than the conception of the League. And upon this idea of theUnited Nations we must build now the machinery of international co-operation,even though we might wish in the future to expand the United Nations into themore ambitious organisation of a revivified League of Nations.5. If we accept the idea of the United Nations as our starting point thequestion at once arises as to whether the United Nations can provide thenecessary cohesion and stability unless the Great Powers are prepared to acceptthe responsibilities of leadership within the United Nations. To this question there can be, in my judgment, only one answer. Not only is it true that thefundamental cause of the League&apos;s failure was the fact that one Great Power,the United States, was outside of it. But my experience of Geneva convincedme that it was only when the Great Powers were ready to lead that the smallerStates were prepared to follow or, indeed, to move at all. I am convinced,therefore, that we must postulate a firm and determined leadership by the great powers within the united Nations. If I am right, two further questions arise.Who are these Great Powers to be? And must they not work together withinthe United Nations as a whole?6. The answer to the second question seems to me to be relatively simple.No international organisation will be effective if the Great Powers are atloggerheads. And whether we are thinking in terms of the United Nations orof the League of Nations it is desirable that there should be the fullest possibleunderstanding and co-operation between the Great Powers. If there is not this connection-operation, then I can see a prospect of a world in precarious balance, withthe Great Powers, each with its circle of client States, facing each other in arivalry which will merge imperceptibly into hostility. The first question is moredifficult. The simplest and, in theory perhaps, the most desirable answer mightbe for the British Commonwealth and the United States to arrogate to themselves the leadership of the United Nations. For a variety of reasons, however, this^ould, I believe, be impracticable. In the first place, the Russians and, indeed,the European nations generally, would not tolerate an undiluted Anglo-Saxonhegemony. And if Russia stands out of the world organisation, whatever it maybe, and, incidentally, we are pledged by our treaty to bring her into it, thesettlement of Europe becomes virtually impossible and the tendency would befor the bulk of the smaller European States to gravitate round Germany as a protection against Russia. Nor, I think, would the Americans welcomeco-operation if it were expressed in terms of a joint Anglo-American leadership.It is impossible to say to what extent the United States will, in fact, be preparedto assume responsibilities towards the world at large, but it is reasonably certainthat they wall be less likely to do so if the problem is presented to them inexclusively Anglo-American terms.7. It is clear, therefore, that the leadership of the United Nations willhave to come from three, at least, of the Great Powers. But the position is complicated by the fact that in American eyes China ranks, with us and theRussians, as a Great Power. This may seem to us to be a completely unrealconception, but I am reasonably convinced that the United States will be unwilling to enter into any world organisation involving specific commitments outside theAmerican continent, unless China, too, is a member of that organisation on termsof at any rate theoretical equality with the Great Powers.
8. I have been driven to the conclusion, therefore, that we should regard the conception of the Four Powers, working within the framework of the united nations, as the present basis of our foreign policy. In the future that basis will,no doubt, be modified. Some Powers, China, for example, or even, to take the mostpessimistic view, the United States, may drop out. Others may come in. Wecannot say now what the position of France may be when the war is over, orwhether she will have either the capacity or the will to resume her historic role.But for the present we must work with the tools that are to our hands. And inthe conception of a Four-Power plan we have. I suggest, something which canbe developed to provide a focal point for world reconstruction.9. I hope that my colleagues will agree that some such focus is needed.For my own part I have no doubt of the need for it. It is not only that whenthe war comes to an end, whether in Europe or in the Far East, there is likelyto be a very long armistice which may, perhaps, be scarcely distinguishable fromanarchy and which will demand immediate, vigorous and united action, of whichthe foundations, at any rate, will have to be laid beforehand. It is not only that there will have to be developed a wide range of technical services in the inter-national field, covering such things as communications, transport of commodities,or investment. But even at the present time we are greatly handicapped indealing with such matters as the American proposal for a Relief Organisationby the fact that we have no clear picture of our objectives or even of the general direction in which we want to travel. Our smaller Allies are already much concerned to know what our plans may be for the military security of europe and for its economic rehabilitation, and with regard to the former they havealready submitted plans to us and to the Americans. As my colleagues are aware,Mr. Stalin put to me, when I was in Moscow, his ideas for the future settlementof Europe, ideas which, couched in general terms, were still sufficiently concreteand definite. The Americans, too, have their own ideas, and it seems to me to beof the first importance that we should discuss these ideas with them before theyhave crystallised, as they may, if we disinterest ourselves entirely from them, intoforms most objectionable to us.10. I do not think that we can afford, in these matters, to let events take their course. It is difficult for us, it is true, to form a view of any particular proposal that may be put up to us by our Allies, the European Bases proposals is a case in point, unless we have the whole picture before us. But that doesnot seem to me to be a wholly adequate reason for refusing to look at the wholepicture. On the contrary, I suggest that it is a strong argument in favour ofour doing so. Clearly if we wait until, by some strange process of automaticgeneration, the United Nations as a whole have conceived, gestated and been delivered of a United Nations policy, we shall wait for some time. It is necessaryto make a start somewhere and I think that we must make it with those Powersamong the United Nations who will in fact exercise a natural leadership among them if the idea of the United Nations is to have any real validity.11. Accordingly I ask the approval of my colleagues for the general lineof policy which I have developed in this paper. There are no specific proposalswhich I have to make at the present time. But I would wnsh to be free, in conversation with our Allies great and small, and, if necessary, in public speeches,to develop the idea that the world organisation of the future must be based uponthe close co-operation of the Four Powers within a framework of the united nations. This idea is already being put forward in a tentative way by the americans in their speeches, and I know that it is very much in their minds. And I believe that the smaller Allies would welcome rather thanresent some sign of initiative and leadership from the Great Powers.The position of Russia is more complicated. At present Russia is inclined toresent too close an association between ourselves and the United States. It wouldbe rash to assume that Russian support of the United Nations is due to theirconviction that it is a workable conception. It is possible, however, that theyAvould co-operate if we presented them with a workable plan which gave them the position, in relation to ourselves and the Americans, which they feel to be dueto them.A.
