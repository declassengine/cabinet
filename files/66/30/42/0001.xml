Iggg &quot;DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)li SECRET ^luHCOfe) 512, COPY NO.   -OS;gth November f 19k2*WAR cabinet british NATIONALITY AND STATUS OF ALIENS bill memorandum by the Home secretary the draft of a Bill to amend the British Nationality and status of Aliens Act, 191kf is being circulated to theLegislation Committee.It would not have been thought necessary to trouble theCabinet about the matters contained in this Bill but for thefact that it is desired to obtain approval for inclusion inthe Bill of clause U to enable British nationality to be conferred upon French nationals in the armed forces of theCrown, notwithstanding that the five years&apos; residence and other conditions laid down in section 2 of the existing Act have notbeen complied with.   The clause is as follows :&quot;k.    If at an;y time during the present war period anapplication for a certificate of naturalization is madeto the Secretary of State by any person appearing to himto be or to have been at any time during that period a french national, then if the Secretary of State is satisfiedthat the applicant -(a) is, or has at any time during that period been,a member of His Majesty&apos;s forces;    and(b) is a proper person to be naturalized as a Britishsub ject,the Secretary of State may grant to the applicant acertificate of naturalization under section two of theprincipal Act notwithstanding that the requirements of subsection (1) of that section are not complied with.&quot;The object of the clause is to give effect to a pledgeby the Prime Minister made on l+th J-uly, 19u1, to French sailorswho joined the British Navy at that time^Shortly.after this pledge was given there was included inan agreement with General de Gaulle a promise to provide facilities for the acquisition of British nationality by persons serving with his forces.    Subsequently General de Gaullestated that he did not expect, or indeed desire, that Frenchmenserving with the Fighting French should be allowed to acquire the Prime Minister, when announcing in the House of Commons themeasure v/hich had been taken to prevent the French Fleet from falling into German hands, said&quot;The French sailors in the main cheerfully accepted the end of aperiod of uncertainty.    A considerable number - 800 or 900 - have,expressed desire to continue the war and some have asked forBritish nationality.   This we are ready to grant withoutprejudice to the other Frenchmen, numbered by thousands, who, prefer to fight on with us as Frenchmen.&quot;
British nationality during the continuance of hostilities.-   itis not, therefore, proposed at present to legislate with&quot;&quot;&quot;regard to persons serving in the Fighting French forces, andthe Clause in the Bill is confined to French nationals serving in the British forces-.The War Cabinet, on 1st September, 1941, agreed that asvV. 1.(41) there was not strong pressure for a Bill entitled Conferment88th      of British Nationality (War Powers) Bill which had beenCon-.&apos;:    prepared to give effect to a proposal on a wider basis, itselusions, consideration should be deferred for the present.    There is notstrong pressure by the Frenchmen serving in the Navy for theredemption of the Prime Minister&apos;s pledge;    and there is alsoa similar desire on the part of Frenchmen serving with the arm;;The First Lord of the Admiralty has made strong representations that legislation should, be no longer deferred-and the Foreign Secretary and I agree with him that it isdesirable that the necessary provision should be made in this bill.......As all the Dominions concurred in or raised no objectionto the original proposal&apos; as embodied.in the 1941 Bill,  it isclear that none of them would object to this much more limitedproposalo    Indeed^ two of them have taken powers to naturalizeany aliens serving with their forces and the Bill contains a clause to recognise such Dominion naturalization,.    The french national Committee have been told,&apos; for information, of theproposal now submitted to the Cabinet0It is thought that any suggestion which may be made incertain quarters that naturalization should be extended toother aliens serving in the British forces should be resisted^The Frenchmen serving with the British forces number only a feihundreds and, because they have not rallied to General de Gaullethey are in bad odour both with the Fighting French and Viehyand consequently they may never be able to return to their owncountry0    The other aliens serving in the British forces numberthousands;    many are enemy aliens and came to this country as temporary settlers, a large proportion of whom are serving inthe Pioneer Corps..    Of the remaining aliens the majority would,if not serving in the British forces, be liable for service inthe forces raised by other Governments in this country.The Prime ministers pledge to Frenchmen is obviously nota precedent for the extension of similar privileges to persons of other nationalities, and apart from any other consideration)naturalization in general has been suspended for over two yefl-&apos;.and its resumption on a large ocale would be controversial.HoM.HOME OFFICE.6th November, 194 q
