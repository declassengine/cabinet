THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 490.October 28, 1942.WAR CABINET.MIGRATION TO DOMINIONS.\ _Memorandum by Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I SHOULD like to have the assent of my colleagues to my consultingDominion Governments now as to their probable attitude towards migration inthe post-war period.This subject has a long history into which I do not propose to enter now.The latest document on migration policy is the Report of the Oversea SettlementBoard published in June 1938 (Cmd. 5766) which deals with the matter fully.It emphasises the principle that migration is a matter not for the UnitedKingdom Government alone but one of joint interest to be settled in co-operationwith Dominion Governments and with their active support and encouragement.I feel that the proper handling of the migration question is one of thegreatest importance for the post-war future of the Empire. The war has shown the need for larger populations in the Dominions if the British Empire is toexercise a strong influence in the post-war world. Moreover, the war has brought about radical changes in the internal economy of the Dominions in theincrease of secondary industries, and this development may well offer a widerscope for the absorption in the Dominions of industrial workers from thiscountry than has been offered in the past when land settlement has had a moreprominent place in migration schemes.A special reason for an early approach to the Dominions is that there isnow a general and widespread interest here in migration as one of the meansof dealing with the post-war, and particularly the immediate post-war, situationand an expectation that the Government will be ready with plans to deal with it.Before the war, the attitude of the Dominions generally as regards the reception and settlement of immigrants was, for domestic reasons arising outof the then economic situation, far from encouraging, though Australia had recently agreed to the resumption of assisted migration for individuals andto sharing the cost with us. I think it probable that Dominion governments will now hesitate to commit themselves on the ground that the practicability of migration will depend on the general economic conditions which will obtainafter the war. Nevertheless, I think that there is everything to be gained by putting the problem fairly and squarely before the Dominions as soon as possible.The above deals only with British migration, i.e., migration from thiscountry to the oversea parts of the Empire where white settlement is possible.A connected question of equal importance is that of European non-Britishmigration to the Dominions, to which reference is also made in the oversea settlement Board Report of June 1938. It seems clear from the populationtrends that the Dominions cannot rely on this country alone to provide anadequate influx of population, and there will also be greater pressure than inthe past from the European nations for admission of their surplus populations.This is, of course, very much a matter for the Dominions themselves, but I thinkit important to raise this issue also when communicating with the Dominions.C. R, A.Dominions Office, S.W.1,October 28, 1942.[24552]
