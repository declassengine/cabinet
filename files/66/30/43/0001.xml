Y)   V   rpV/.P.C42)  5137TH NOVEMBER,   1942.COPY NO.WAR CABINETSHIPPING ASSISTANCE FROM U.S.A.PRESENT POSITION IN WASHINGTONNote by Minister of War Transportlo      The following summary of an appreciation of theshipping position as seen in Washington,  just receivedfrom Sir Arthur Salter, is circulated for the informationof the war Cabinet.2,      Sir Arthur says that at the moment (and he is dealingwith a situation which changes from day to day) theshipping situation is dominated by the U.S. Army &apos;and Navydemands,  especially for the Pacific, Solomon Islands andAlaska.      &quot;In the atmosphere that develops when a campaignlike the Solomons is being fought, and the news of each dayattended with grave and growing anxiety,  there is a naturaldisinclination on the part, not only of the Servicedirectly concerned, but of the highest authorities to denyanything that is asked&quot;,U.S. Service demands for November loading exceed thetotal of ships physically available, consequently &quot;every other service has been in danger&quot;.30      In these circumstances, the British Merchant ShippingMission is finding it very difficult to keep the U.S.  ships already allotted to the Red Sea/Indian Ocean services andthe prospects of securing the extra 10 to 15 ships for this area, for which we recently asked,  are not encouraging.4,      Looking a little further ahead, difficulties loomlarger,      The Solomons look like making large additional demands and Sir Arthur regards it as likely to be extremelydifficult to divert any U.S.  shipping from the Pacific tothe Atlantic, where the prospective position is alsodisturbing in view of losses and possible extra demands for present and prospective operations.     Only one largeresource is near at hand and that is the &quot;unhappy U.K.import programme&quot;.5,      The directions that emerge from strategic planningnecessarily restrict the scope and power of the War ShippingAdministration to assist us.      The ability of the C.S.A.B.,to work on a combined basis is necessarily conditioned bythe extent to which strategy is combined (and not separate).6.     Sir Arthur sees no room for economy of tonnage in further substantial civilian economies in the U.S.A.Before they become belligerents the U.S. had withdrawn from commercial or civilian service some 1-g million deadweighttons of dry cargo shipping or nearly a quarter of their

90St* o atotal shipping resources (apart from tankers) and inthe last 7 months they have withdrawn nearly anotherl  million deadweight tons.     But these economies,together with the surplus of U..3, &quot;building overlosses making 3 million deadweight tons in all, havebeen practically all absorbed by the increased demands of the UeS. Army and Navy,7.      In these circumstances the prospects of earlyassistance on any marked scale either to our ownimporting needs or our direct military needs for theRed. Sea and ether areas appear to be poor.8.      I need not remind the War Cabinet that, if theNorth Atlantic becomes unduly denuded of tonnage andour shipping resources are hypothecated to distantroutes, it becomes increasingly difficult to find thetonnage needed to maintain essential supplies or meetspecial operational demands,    Difficulties are greatlyaccentuated when demands are made at comparatively short notice and involve the use of ships of goodspeeds or carrying special lifting appliances.It is therefore^of the utmost importance thatthe Ministries of Food and Supply should realiseto the full the possibilities of short arrivals inthis country during the next few months and that theChiefs of Staff should give the Ministry of war transport the longest possible notice of any newmilitary requirement that appears likely to requireshipping over the next few months.(Intldo) L,MINISTRY OF WAR TRANSPORT.7TH NOVEMBER&quot;, 1942,
