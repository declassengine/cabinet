PART I.-ALLIED NAVAL CONTINGENTS.Notes on the various Allied Navies.General.General State of Morale and Efficiency.I. Continued improvement is seen and, what is also important, the tiesbetween the British and Allied Navies grow steadily stronger.Growth of Allied Navies.2. As will be seen from Appendix I, the number of ships and menincreases steadily.3. A landmark in the growth of the Allied navies is the decision to let thePolish Navy take over a Cruiser, H.M.S. Dragon, in 1943.The A Hied A dmirals.4. At the invitation of the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, bomber command, the Allied Admirals visited aerodromes in the Eastern Counties onthe night of the 25th August.5. The usual monthly meetings of the Allied Admirals, when V.C.N.S.explains the general strategical situation, were held. These meetings are muchappreciated by the Allied Admirals.Bestowal of Decorations to Allied Naval Officers and Men.6. Medals and decorations were presented to Allied naval officers and menby the First Sea Lord at Admiralty House on the 28th July.Free French Navy.Morale and Discipline.7. Morale and discipline of the Free French Navy has been well maintained.There was some momentary indiscipline in the Corvette Roselys, when some thirtymen refused duty as a protest against punishment awarded to one or twojnembers of the crew. The majority of the men acted impulsively and quicklyreturn to duty. The ringleaders have been punished. It does not appear thatthe general spirit of the ship has deteriorated.8. The tone of La Melpomene is not too good, but deterioration nearlyalways sets in in French ships after a prolonged period of inactivity due toendless repairs, which has been the fate of this ship.Recruiting.9. About seventy naval officers and some 500 naval ratings were broughtto this country from Madagascar as prisoners of war. Some two hundred ratingssoon joined the Free French, but so far the naval officers have shown no sign of coming over.10. Recruiting from other sources has resulted in a further 300 menjoining the force during the third quarter.II. Approval was given to raise a force of 2,600 native petty officers andmen for coastwatching in the Levant.Raid on Dieppe.12. Three of the Free French Chasseurs based at Cowes took part in the raid. The British Senior Officer of the Chasseurs reported on their enthusiasm,coolness and general behaviour under fire.Losses.13. The Chasseur Rennes was lost due to air attack in the Channel on the13th July.  The only survivor was the British. Liaison Officer.Training.14. A further 80 men have completed their training in H.M.S. Royal Arthurat Skegness during the last three months.[24504] b 2
15. At other R.N. training establishments 176 officers and men receivedinstruction in various special subjects.Ships Paid Off and Commissioned.16. The M.L. Flotilla at Weymouth is being replaced by a Flotilla of newM.T.Bs., which will be based at Dartmouth. This will probably mean morechances of offensive operations and has given much pleasure to the free french Navy.Disposition of Ships.17. Two of the Chasseurs formerly based on Cowes have sailed for french equatorial Africa.IS. It has been arranged that the Corvettees employed in the North andSouth Atlantic shall interchange one by one after spending about a year on either station.19. The French Admiral has been pressing the Admiralty to bring back into service several vessels of the French Navy which have for some time been used asdepot ships, &amp;c, despite the fact that this will entail much dockyard work andthat their reliability can never be high, even after extensive refit. It is probablethat the Admiral wishes to ensure that as many ships as possible of the oldFrench Navy should be present when the Allies eventually occupy French ports.Ships Refitted.20. Seven ships, including the submarine Jvnon, completed refits duringthe quarter and seven are still in hand. This number includes the destroyerLeopard, being repaired at Simonstown after a collision and the destroyerTriomphant at Sydney, N.S.W.Camp at Emstvorth.21.&apos; This camp, which has been named &quot; Caserne Bir Hacheim.&quot; is now in use, and has largely taken the place of the small and uncomfortable accommoda-tion and Training Ships at Portsmouth. The improved facilities for drill andtraining will, it is hoped, have a beneficial result generally.Frenchmen in the Royal Navy.22. Four of these ratings were taken prisoner by the French in north africa when their ship was sunk in a Malta Convoy. Reports were receivedfrom the United States Consular Service that they were being treated differentlyfrom the British ratings, and, in fact, that they might be shot as traitors.Polish Navy.Morale and Efficiency.23. The only exception to the uniformly high standard of discipline and morale lay in 38 recruits of American nationality who had joined in Canada.These men failed to settle down under Polish naval discipline and have beensent back to Canada for demobilisation.24.   The efficiency of all units remains most satisfactory.Dieppe Operation.25.   The destroyer Slazak took part in this operation.Operational Employment.26. The destroyer Piorun is to join the Home Fleet. The prospect of change from convoy escort duties has not only given great pleasure to her crew,but is much appreciated by the whole Polish Fleet.Ships to be Commissioned..27. The destroyer Myrmidon, due to complete early in December, has been allocated to the Poles and is also destined to join the Home Fleet in due course.28. The cruiser Dragon is to be handed over to the Poles about June 1943.This will be the first occasion when any ship larger than a destroyer has been lentto an Allied Navy. There is no doubt thai the Poles will do everything in their power to justify this mark of the Admiralty&apos;s confidence in their efficiency.
29. The submarine P. 52, due to complete in November, is to be manned bythe Poles.   She will be named Dzik.Ships Refitted.30. The destroyer Burza was duly recommissioned on the completion of herrefit in July. Modifications in her armament have been carried out. Thesubmarine Sokol is still in Dockyard hands.Recruiting.31. Of the recruits recently arrived in this country from Russia via SouthAfrica, 350 have been allocated to the navy and have already commenced their training at Devonport. This number will be brought up to 800 by December,thus enabling the Dragon and Myrmidon to be manned as mentioned above.Royal Netherlands Navy.Morale and Efficiency.32. The morale in Netherlands ships remains high. The zeal and efficiency of the crews of the minesweepers employed at Milford Haven have been mostmarked.Successes.33. H.Neth.M. submarine O. 23 made a successful attack on a convoy in theStraits of Malacca and it is believed that two ships were sunk.34. Dutch M.T.B&apos;s. have several times been in action in the Channel. Ahit on a tanker is claimed.Ships Commissioned, Building and Refitting.35. The second motor minesweeper which was commissioned on the 6thJuly was lost on the 12th July, but she is being replaced and two more vessels of this class will be commissioned shortly.36. A patrol vessel of the latest type was presented by President roosevelt to Queen Wilhelmina on the occasion of Her Majesty&apos;s visit to the United States.She has been named Queen Wilhelmina. She will be employed on escort duties inthe Caribbean37. The destroyer Isaac Sweers has completed her refit at Southampton andis temporarily attached to the Home Fleet..38. The submarines 0. 9 and O. 10 are at present refitting in this country.K. 14 and K. 15 are shortly to be refitted in the United States.39. The first of the new submarines, P. 47, is due to complete in November,and a second one of the same class, due to complete in the spring of 1943, hasbeen allocated.Ships to be taken over by the Royal Navy.40. The cruiser Sicmatra is returning to this country from the indian ocean. Owing to shortage of personnel in Royal Netherlands Navy she is to beloaned to the Royal Navy.41. The torpedo boats Z. 7 and Z. 8 are to be loaned to the Royal Navyfor the same reason.Naval Cadets.42. Although the Dutch maintain a naval college of their own in thiscountry, they have sent nine Cadets to Dartmouth for the term which has justbegun. They will remain for two terms with our own Special Entry Cadets.Confidence is felt that this opportunity of mixing with British Cadets will produce results as satisfactory in the case of the Dutch as it has in the case ofthe French and Norwegians.Royal Norwegian Navy.Morale and Efficiency.43.   Very satisfactory.
Successes.44. The corvettes Potentilla, Eglantine and Acanthus took part with .M.S. Viscount in an attack on a number of submarines which were shadowinga convoy in the North Atlantic during the night of the 24th/25th August. the norwegians claim two submarines for certain and two probably destroyed.Minesweeping.45. The Norwegians have now token over all the minesweeping duties atDundee under the command of a Norwegian Senior Naval Officer.Ships Commissioned.46. The &apos;&apos; Hunt&apos;&apos; class destroyer Eskdale was commissioned on the20th July.47. President Roosevelt presented a patrol vessel to the Norwegian navy and she has been named King Haakon VII. She is at present based atHalifax. N.S.. but will probably come to the United Kingdom in the near future.48. The 30th M.T.B. Flotilla has now been constituted with eightNorwegian-manned boats. The flotilla will be based at Invergorden and will use Lerwick as an advanced base.Ship to be Loaned to the Roycd Navy.49. The torpedo boat Draug, which has been used latterly as a depot shipat Port Edgar, is to be loaned to the Royal Navy for use in towing a high speedtarget for gunnery practice.Recruiting.50. The personnel of the Royal Norwegian Navy has increased by 450 duringthe quarter. Very few of these men arrived from Norway. The great majorityare merchant seamen who have come from different parts of the world.Royal Navy (Section Beige).Ships Commissioned.51. The second motor minesweeper No. 191, was commissioned on the27th July. It was not possible to form a complete Belgian crew and most of the engine-room personnel is still British, but it is hoped to make up the deficiencyshortly, partly by a number of men released from the Belgian army.Recruiting.52. Recruiting has been slow, and only eight men have joinedH.M.S. Royal Arthxir for training during the quarter. The Belgian authorities,however, expect a considerable improvement in the near future.Future Plans.53. Four minesweeping trawlers are in process of being fitted out for service in the Belgian Congo. The manning of these ships is the first commitment on future recruiting.  About seventy men will be required.54. The first Belgian officer to join the Section Beige, Lieutenant Billet,R.N.R., took part in the Dieppe operation in command of a T.L.C. This craftdid not return and he and her crew are missing.Royal Hellenic Navy.Morale and Efficiency.55. The incident referred to in the last report, when a number of Greekratings refused duty at the R.N. Barracks, Chatham, resulted in eighteen men being court-martialled for collective disobedience in time of war. Six of them weresentenced to imprisonment for life and the remainder to eleven or twelve years.There i&amp; little doubt that the trouble having started, it was fomented by elements in Greek Seamen&apos;s Unions. No further trouble has since occurred. the discipline of the men in the barracks is certainly slack when judged by ourstandards, but in the ships now in commission it appears to be satisfactory andthere is little doubt that, after the crews have become more accustomed to theirrhips, they will be of some use to the Allied cause.
56. The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, has reported very favourablyon the increased efficiency of the Greek submarines operating under his command.Ships Commissioned.57. The destroyer Adrias was commissioned on the 20th July and the destroyer Kanaris on the 28th July.58. His Majesty the King of the Hellenes attended the commissioning ofthe Kanaris and also visited Scapa Flow, where he inspected Kanaris and A driasduring their working-up.59.   The Miaoulis will not complete before November.60. The destroyers Pindos and Kanaris, after working-up at Scapa Flow,have left for the Mediterranean. Unfortunately, the Adrias, having alreadydamaged a turbine due to lack of usual precautions, ran aground when leavingScapa and sustained considerable damage. She will not be ready for serviceuntil the end of the year.Recruiting.61. Certain age groups of Greek citizens in the Middle East having been called up, an addition of 450 men was secured for the navy.62. The crews for the fifth and sixth destroyers and the two corvettes tobe manned in this country have not yet left the Middle East, but it is hopedthey will sail shortly.Royal Yugoslav Navy.63. As the Yugoslavs were unable to reman the submarine Nebojsa she hasbeen lent to the Royal Navy. A few Yugoslav ratings are believed to have remained in her.64.   No personnel to man the prospective corvette has as yet materialised.Welfare of Allied Navies Generally.65. The Welfare Officer on the staff of P.N.L.O. has continued his visits to the ports where Allied naval personnel are based. Clubs, canteens and hostelshave been added to those already in existence, notably at Greenock, Cowes andMil ford Haven.66. Private hospitality is continually increasing and the proportion ofAllied seamen who have British homes to visit must now be large.67. The Allied naval authorities themselves are taking a greater part in the welfare arrangements for their own nationals than they did previously.PART II.-ALLIED ARMY CONTINGENTS.Free French Forces.Location.68.

A French troop of the Inter-Allied Commando is stationed at Criccieth,N. Wales.71. On the 14th July a party of 350 all ranks from the Free French Forcesattended a parade at Wellington Barracks.72. A party of Free French troops also took part in the Aldershot &quot; SovietWeek.&quot;73. A second party of 20 O.R&apos;s spent a few days at the A.F.V. ranges atCastlemain at the beginning of July.74. A number of men were decorated in London on the 20th July by HisMajesty King Haakon for their services in Norway in 1940.
75. Captain Stadler attended exercises in August in Northern Ireland with american Forces there.76. A new unit called the &quot; Batterie Tractee &quot; has been formed which hasa strength of 3 officers and 27 O.R.&apos;s. This unit carried out firing practices atLarkhill on the 24th/25th August and the 22nd/23rd September.77. The Compagnie Portee is being trained on Battle School lines andrecently held an all-day exercise, which included the crossing of a lake.78. A.T.E.W.T. was held in the Officers&apos; Mess on the 16th September atwhich General Gentilhomme, Colonel Rouger and Colonel Renouard were present.It was considered by the Liaison Officer who was present that the scheme was ona rather too ambitious scale.79. The A.F.V. unit (Escadron Mixte) is sending 3 parties of about 25all ranks each for three weeks&apos; attachments to 5th Canadian Armoured Division.80. 8,000 rounds of -300 ammunition have been made available to enablerange practice to recommence.81. The P.A.D. arrangements at the camp have been overhauled in view of areport from the Inspecting Officer of Aldershot District and a new P.A.D. officerhas been appointed.Security.82. Satisfactory. The security officer has been replaced by a Sergeantwho has attended a security course at Matlock.Welfare.83.   Satisfactory.Morale.84.   Satisfactory.Notes by Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents.85. The Free French Forces at Old Dean Common, Camberley, are princi-pally a training depot and there are no trained units or fixed establishments.I gathered, however, that they are beginning to feel that they should now keepwhat men they have got, and if possible be reinforced, against the day when they hope to re-enter France under arms. This is important, as a tangible sign thatthe flag has never been pulled down.86. Officers and men go to our schools and courses of instruction and arevery keen when they return, though this is apt to wear off owing to lack of mento practise what they have learnt.  This can&apos;t very well be avoided.87. Their camp is well laid out, for a larger force than they have at present,and particularly well cared for. The troops are well fed and well catered for asregards living rooms, library, canteen, &amp;c; all they require is to be about tentimes the size to make them all feel that they are a serious and tangible asset.Polish Forces.Establishment.

The Polish Army Corps are located in an area North and South of the firth of Forth, with Corps Headquarters at Kinnaird House, Falkirk.91. In July a tented camp for 1,000 men was pitched at Auchterpool forthe reception of Polish recruits from the Middle East; tented camps were alsoerected for troops in the Polish Tank Training area.92. Black Barony Hotel, Eddleston, has been taken over as a Staff Collegefor Polish (and Czechoslovak) officers to accommodate 50 students.
It eorganisa tion.93.   The reorganisation of the Polish Forces as shown in the last quarterlyreport is proceeding apace.94.   A Polish troop will shortly join the Inter-Allied Commando in north wales.95.   Major-General Boruta-Spiechowicz, who returned from Russia, took over as 2nd-in-Command of the Polish Corps at the end of July (vice Major-General Kossakowski, who left for the Middle East in June), and has now taken over command of the Corps in succession to Lieutenant-General Kukiel. who has\       been appointed Minister of War at the Polish Ministry in London.96.   Lieutenant-Colonel Rosner, Chief of the 2nd Bureau, Polish CorpsHeadquarters, was killed on 14th September in a motor accident.Equipment.97. The present position regarding major items of equipment in possessionof the Polish Forces is as follows : 	Guns.			Machine Guns.			Anti-Tank Kifles.	Mortars.		Carriers.			Tanks (Cruiser).	McD.	Fid.

In addition to normal training and the attendance of large numbers ofofficers and other ranks at Polish and British Schools of Instruction (200 officersand N.C.O.&apos;s are at present attending the A.F.V. School at Bovington), the polish forces have taken part in a number of exercises and demonstrations during thelast three months, the more important of which are as follows.99. In July the 16th Armoured Brigade provided demonstrations to localHome Guard and Army Cadet Force units, opportunities being given to these units to watch tank training and to ride in the tanks.100. A combined tactical scheme, involving field firing from squadron of tanks, anti-tank and 25-pr. guns was carried out on 29th July on LammermuirArtillery Range.101. Early in August the Polish Forces provided two independent forma-tions (a Rifle Brigade Group and an Armoured Group) for a.large scale exerciselasting a week, in co-operation with British troops. The Polish troops showed a high morale and fighting spirit throughout, and considerable power ofendurance. For instance, two Polish battalions at- one time were continuouslyeither in action or on the march for 37 hours, during which time they got no food,but they appeared just as full of keenness as ever at the end of it. Theexcellence of the work of the Polish engineers was most noticeable. The capability of the actual tank crews in carrying out repairs on the battlefield was note-worthy. During the exercise the co-operation between British and Polishformations was, on the whole, excellent. The Poles not only got great value outof the seven days&apos; exercise, but thoroughly enjoyed it.102. On the 19th August a combined tactical scheme was held on theLammermuir Artillery Range, involving units of the Support Group and16th Armoured Brigade of the Armoured Division. The object was to demonstrate the combined use of tanks and artillery on a given objective. Liveammunition was used.103. On the 22nd August a demonstration of a parachute landing operation was given by the Parachute Brigade, aircraft and a good deal of equipmentbeing provided by the British Airborne Division. The demonstration was attended by the Commander-in-Chief, Norwegian Forces, and a number of localBritish commanders and staffs.[24504] c
104. A parachute landing operation on the 23rd August was witnessedby the Commander-in-Chief, Norwegian Forces, and several American officers,including the Military Attache.105. On the 8th September an exercise was held involving units of the PolishArmoured Division. The most noticeable features were, in the first phase of the battle Practice, the work of the individual infantrymen, who advanced well,making good use of the ground, and in the second phase the co-operation of the artillery, whose fire wras well timed, in support of the tank attack.106. On occasions Polish units have been exercised in attacks on aerodromes,including one by a company of their paratroops, who made an excellent landing.Fifth Columnists, in R.A.F. uniforms, from the Parachute Brigade operated toassist the attack from within.- Apart, however, from one platoon, which layhidden and advanced skilfully later, the attackers would have suffered heavy casualties from this hurried attack.107. On the 22nd September an exercise was held, in co-operation with R..A.F., to test the possible density of vehicles on roads. As a result the GeneralOfficer Commanding, Polish Armoured Division, considers the best density to,enable easy deployment for battle is 40 V.T.M. for unarmoured and 60 V.T.M.for armoured vehicles, in blocks of from 4 to 10 vehicles to constitute tacticalgroups. On this basis he considers that the interval between the unarmouredportion of the column would be an average of 25 yards and the interval betweenblocks 150 yards; and in the armoured column 15 yards and 100 yards respectively.108. During August and September 42 officers, staff and regimental, fromthe Polish Armoured Division did a fortnight&apos;s attachment (in two batches) toour 42nd Armoured Division.109. During September Polish troops have assisted farmers with the cornand flax harvests in Fife.. A artillery.110. In July and August the 10th Anti-Tank Battery fired on theLammermuir Range and the 1st Medium Regiment carried out firing practiceson Harperleas Range, Fife: The Medium Regiment carried out battle practiceshoots at Redesdale Practice Camp, when 4-5-inch howitzers and 5-5-inch gunhowitzers were fired.111. On the 6th September a ceremony of presentation of RegimentalColours to the 1st Polish Light Artillery Regiment by the town of Coatbridgetook place at St. Andrews. At a subsequent March Past. Lieutenant-GeneralKukiel and Lord Elgin took the salute.112. On the 16th and 17th September a motorised Artillery Regimentcarried out practice shoots with squadrons from the Armoured Regiments onLammermuir Artillery Range. This training tanks with artillery support isto be continued for a period of three months (one shoot per week) to accustomindividual squadrons to co-operate with a battery of 25-pr. guns,, and moreparticularly to reduce&apos; the time taken in tuning the No. 11 Wireless Sets(Artillery) to work with the No. 19 Wireless Sets (Tanks) on the same frequency.Teaching of English.113.. Sixteen officers attended a month&apos;s course in English for RegimentalCommanding Officers, 2nd-in-Commands and Adjutants in July. Six weeks&apos;courses under a British Council teacher were run in August for 16 officersadvanced class, 14 officers elementary class and an N.C.O&apos;s. class, in addition to a staff and Regimental Officers&apos; Course run by a British Army Education Officer.114. At the end of August, after an entrance test, a six weeks&apos; course for20 Polish instructors in English began at St. Andrews University.115. Fifty-four candidates were tested for the Interpreters&apos; Coursecommencing on the 1st September. The standard of candidates was so high itwas difficult to select the 15 best required.116. Several lectures in English have been given to British units by PolishOfficers on various aspects of Poland and the Polish Campaign, 1939.Security.117.   Satisfactory.

In July the Brigade Headquarters, 1st Battalion, and Armoured CarSquadron, in combination, took part in a 3-day Central Midland District exercise.On another occasion these units undertook a 2-day exercise to practise the occupa-tion of an outpost position, followed by a withdrawal at night and an attack against an aerodrome.133. In addition, during the past three months, individual units have carried out over 30 exercises.134. On the 16th August a party of 30 all ranks attended the AirborneForces Depot at Hardwick Hall for a fortnights preliminary parachute training,followed by a fortnight at the Parachute Training School, Ringway. A furtherparty of 30 all ranks did a course of parachute training at Ringway from the16th&apos; to the 29th September.135.

A Norwegian troop will shortly join the Inter-Allied Commando in north Wales.Liaison Courses for Norwegian Personnel.150. The Norwegians have run two courses in Scotland. Lectures weredelivered by British and Norwegian officers, and attachments of the Norwegianpersonnel to appropriate British units and formations have been arranged. a third Liaison Course is now running in London. This will mean that 20 officers,23 N.C.O.&apos;s and 60 civilians from Norwegian Government offices in London (to beicommissioned when required as liaison officers) have been through Liaison Courses,though it does not follow that this number will all be available for such dutyas 10 of the officers referred to above have been posted away from the Contingentsince the 1st Course.Equipment.151.

At the moment, the Norwegians are suffering from trying to do too much with too few. They have on hand a reorganisation of their contingent,which,-requires, amongst other units, the building up of four IndependentMountain Companies with horsed transport (carts and pack); and they havecontracted to find a troop for the Inter-Allied Commando, to train with the help of our Airborne Division a Parachute Company, to send officers and men for training with our coastal artillery, to start a war academy in London, and finally to find reinforcements for their Navy and Mercantile Marine.. All thesematters are a sign of the increasing interest in soldiering, and a. realisation of how much they have to plan foi their future.Belgian Forces.Establishment. Officers.

On the 21st July a party of 23 officers and 350 other ranks took part ina parade in London on the occasion of Belgian Independence Day.177. On the 24th July the Armoured Car Squadron carried out an exerciseto test communications and the speedy and accurate passing on of information and orders, with satisfactory results.178. On the 30th and 31st July, and on the 18th and 19th September, theField Battery attended a practice camp at Traws Fynydd.179. On the 3rd/4th August the brigade held a night exercise to be followedby.a dawn attack, which, in fact, took place much later and spoiled the realismof the exercise.   The night patrolling, however, was carried out well.180. On the 14th August a senior officer from &quot;Headquarters, WesternCommand, visited all units and was impressed by the appearance of the troops and the ingenuity displayed by the parachute company in providing methods of preliminary training.181. On the 19th August a party of 60 officers and other ranks commenceda month&apos;s course at the Allied Special Training Centre, Inverlochy. about half a dozen were found physically unfit to undergo this strenuous course and hadto be returned, but this lack of judgment in the selection of personnel is not likely to be repeated on future courses at this school.182. On the nights of the 24th and 25th August two companies of the1st Battalion carried out night firing on an assault course in the Central Midlanddistrict, and on the night of the 27th the parachute company had a successfulnight&apos;s training, including firing on a range with the aid of flares.183. The units detailed to be attached to the 49th Division left theLeamington area for their new locations on the 2nd September, took part in alarge exercise from the 8th to the 15th and were highly commended by the ArmyCommander.as the result of a decision taken by the Belgian Council of Ministers on the3rd September. Colonel Lecomte assumed command at Leamington on the7th September.Organisation.170. There has been no change in the composition of the Belgian land forces since that detailed in the last report.171. The contingent has provided a troop for the Inter-Allied Commando,located at Abersoch, North Wales.A accommodation.172. The units attached to the 49th Division are accommodated undercanvas at Penybont, Harpton Court and Porthcawl, in Wales. They will shortlygo into winter quarters.
184. On the 13th September 30 all ranks attended the Airborne Forces Depotfor a fortnights preliminary parachute training prior to attending the ParachuteTraining School at Ringway for a fortnights parachute training.Security.185.

The General Officer Commanding, Central Midland District, paid afarewell inspection of the departing units on the morning of the 31st August;the Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents visited the establishmentsremaining behind in the Leamington area in the afternoon of the 31st, and thenext morning had a talk with the Commanding Officers of the three field unitsgoing to the 49th Division. The late and present Belgian Brigade Commanderswere present at this talk.Note by Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents.189. Since the last report the Belgian Contingent has given cause to a gooddeal of anxiety, due to increasing discussions and disagreements amongstthemselves which finally affected their discipline. The Acting Defence Minister,in trying to deal with various complaints in his own person by direct contact with disgruntled individuals, tended to lessen the authority and prestige of his military commanders and so matters grew worse instead of better, until finallya request was made by the Belgian Ministry to the War Department forintervention on our part. As the result of a discussion between the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, the D.C.I.G.S. and the C.L.A.C., it was proposed thatthe field units of the Belgian Contingent (a battalion, a battery and an armoured car squadron) should be attached to a British Division for an intitial period ofthree months, each to its corresponding arm of the service; that the departmentaland training units should remain, but under .a more junior officer with a smalladministrative staff; and that the existing Commander of the Belgian Contingentshould be employed elsewhere. This was agreed in toto and immediately by theBelgian Government, and the changes took place within a few days.190. An upheaval of this sort must leave an aftermath, but I believe that theposition of the troops has been bettered and that their morale and discipline willonce again be satisfactory.Czechoslovak Forces.Establishment.

The organisation of the Czechoslovak Independent Brigade Groupremains as given in the last Quarterly Report. As tanks will not be availablefor the Czechs for some time to come, their wish to be organised into an ArmouredFormation is not likely to be fulfilled in the near future; so the CzechoslovakCommander-in-Chief is submitting new proposals for consideration.

In addition to normal training the points of greatest interest duringthe last three months are as follows :  197. The 2nd Battalion had an operational role on the beaches at Seaton,handed over to a British battalion on the 19th August, prior to the move of the brigade to the East Coast. On the 7th Jufy this battalion carried out a counter-attack exercise at Beer Head.198. The Anti-Tank battery carried out firing practice at Okehamptonranges in July, registering 74 per cent, hits, and again on the Foulness A/TankRange in September.199. On the 21st July certain units of the brigade practised, a quick decisionexercise, utilizing the special protective detachments of all arms, and on the22nd July other units carried out firing practice at Merrival Range, Devon, everyweapon being fired; the firing of the mortars and 25-pounders was particularlyaccurate. This was repeated on the 4th August, when the Commander, 8th Corps,was present.200. On the 28th/29th July the brigade took part in an exercise to practisecounter-attack in an anti-invasion role.201. During August the brigade moved from the Southern to EasternCommand, and was occupied in settling down to new locations and taking over their new operational role in the Lowestoft Area.202. An interesting artillery test was carried out on the 18th Septemberwith 6-pdr. Hotchkiss and 25-pdr. guns, firing out to sea, the former from the beaches.203. On the 19th and 20th September General Miroslav, the CzechoslovakCommander, directed an exercise caried out by the brigade under arrangementsmade by our 54th Division, involving reconnaissance and attack withco-ordinated fire plan, consolidation with all-round defence and a tank counter-attack by a detachment of the Royal Armoured Corps.204.

210. General Loyd, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, SouthernCommand, paid a farewell visit to the Brigade on the 7th August.211. Since their arrival in the Lowestoft Area the Czechoslovak Brigadehas been inspected by the Commander 11th Corps District and the Commander54th Division.212. The Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents visited the Brigadeon the 10th September.Note by Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents.213. The Czechs are still without reinforcements, nor is there any likelihood of any appreciable increase in their strength in this country. They have hopes of getting some more men for their contingent in the Middle East. Theirauthorities still feel that it would be best to have all their troops under onecommand, and of the two alternatives they would prefer to concentrate in theMiddle East.PART III.-ALLIED AIR CONTINGENTS.Combined Operation against Dieppe on August 19, 1942.214. In this operation eleven Allied Fighter Squadrons played a conspicuouspart, not only in the protection of our land and sea forces, but also in thedestruction of enemy aircraft, which was one of the major results of the operation.This was not achieved without loss, and losses in these Allied Squadrons were atthe same average rate as the losses incurred by Royal Air Force Squadrons taking part. The following comparative figures of gains and losses will enable the workof the Allied Squadrons to be fairly assessed.Enemy aircraft claimed as :       Our losses in :PilotsProbably Aircraft   killed and destroyed, destroyed.

These did not have the sameopportunity of destroying enemy aircraft and suffered proportionally greater casualties.)215. The part played by the various National Squadrons was briefly asfallows : 216. The Northolt Polish Wing, consisting of 302, 303, 306, 308 and 317(Polish) Squadrons, was led by Wing Commander Janus and Squadron-LeaderNowierski and operated from Northolt, Heston and Redhill, flew five fighter coverand two bomber escort patrols during the day. Two of these patrols were particu-larly successful: viz., (i) at 0930 hours when 303 and 317 Squadrons attacked anddispersed a formation of Do. 217s with their fighter protection which were about to bomb our shipping, inflicting severe casualties on the enemy without loss to themselves (three Ju. 88s, 1 Do. 217 and 3 F.W. 190s were destroyed, 5 F.W. 190sprobably destroyed, and three other enemy aircraft damaged); and (ii) at1550 hours, when 303 and 317 Squadrons were detached from the wing byWing-Commander Janus and detailed to attack a formation of bombers whichwere approaching a convoy, while the remainder of the wing remained over the convoy. 303 and 317 Squadrons carried out their attack with good effect, shootingdown 4 He. Ills, 1 Do. 217 and an F.W. 190. A patrol at 1245 hours by 302, 303,308 and 317 Squadrons accounted for 2^ F.W. 190s. destroyed. All other patrols were carried out according to plan and without event.217. The flying discipline of this wing appears to have been remarkablygood. It should be noted that two out of the five Polish Squadrons (viz., 302 and308 Squadrons) were not engaged at all during their patrols.218. Two Czech Squadrons (310 and 312) led by Wing-Commander Mrazek,flew four patrols during the day from Redhill. The first of these on escort toHurribombers detailed to attack enemy &quot; E &quot; boats, was uneventful and pilotsjoined in an attack on enemy vessels near Boulogne. Their second sortie at1050 hours encountered some 12 Do. 217 bombers with a cover of some 20
F.W. 190s; 310 attacked and dispersed the former while 312 engaged the latter,and as a result 3 enemy bombers and 2 fighters were probably destroyed, while9 bombers and 4 fighters were damaged without loss to our squadrons. A patrolat 1430 hours by 310 Squadron was uneventful; 312 Squadron on their last patrolsighted and attacked a number of Do. 217s just before they were due to be relieved,destroying two of them and damaging a third.219. The two Norwegian Squadrons (331 and 332) operated with the NorthWeald Wing and were led by Wing-Commander Scott Maiden and later by major Maehre. They were conspicuously successful in engagements with enemy fighters, with whom they were in combat during their first patrol at0655 hours. Shortly after arriving over the convoy they sighted an equal forceof F.W. 190s, engaged them, and destroyed four, probably destroyed three and damaged seven others for the loss of three aircraft and two pilots; and again at 1415 hours, when they were attacked by some 17 F.W. 190s, they destroyed 2,probably destroyed 1 and damaged 5. In the meantime, on their 1200 hours patrolthey attacked and nearly annihilated a formation of 10 Do. 217s. shooting downfive of them, probably destroying one, and damaging three others; only one ofthese bombers got away scot free.220. No. 340 (Fighting French) Squadron, operated with the HornchurchWing (Wing Commander P. H. Hugo) and flew four patrols during the day. Intheir first they acted as bottom cover to the wing on shipping cover from0515 hours and were attacked by 6 FW. 190s, which they beat off without loss;at 1000 hours on their second patrol they attacked 6 Do. 217s. which were divingon our shipping, destroying two and scoring hits on the rest. Their third patroltook place at 1220 hours, when five pilots shaved in the destruction of a Do. 217.and at 1910 hours they flew a final patrol to cover our shipping 15 miles southof Beachy Head, and were instrumental in heading off a number of enemy bomberswhich were attempting to attack from cloud cover.221. No. 350 (Belgian) Squadron were stationed at Redhill and flew withthe Kenley Wing. This Squadron was also most successful in combats with enemy FW. 190 fighters, of which they destroyed six during their four patrols and damaged 11 others. Two of these (those shot down during their first sortieat 0720 hours) were part of a formation of F.W. 190s carrying bombs which wereattacking our shipping and which were dispersed as a result of 350 Squadron&apos;sengagement. At 1000 hours 350 Squadron engaged strong enemy fighter cover toa formation of Ju. 8Ss and damaged 5 in addition to two destroyed, and theyrepeated this score again at 1500 hours, when they were patrolling our returningvessels and met a strong force of enemy fighters.General Note on Morale.222. Subject to some qualification, particularly that in paragraphs 296-300,morale in the Allied Air Forces remains remarkably high.Free French Air Force.Operations (see also Appendix IV).223. No. 340 (Free French) Fighter Squadron moved from R.A.F. Station,West Hampnett, to R.A.F. Station, Hornchurch, on the 28th July, 1942, and toR.A.F. Station, Biggin Hill, on the 24th September, 1942. The Squadron hasbeen actively engaged throughout the period, and its part in the combined operations against Dieppe on the 19th August has been described inparagraph 220 above.General.224. It has been decided to bring to the United Kingdom from the middle east the personnel of the Lorraine and Alsace Squadrons, and it is hoped thatthe move can be effected at an early date in order that they can be re-formed aspart of the Metropolitan Air Force.225. The Free French authorities finally decided to send a Fighter Unit, tothe Russian Front (see paragraph 48 of the Twenty-first Report), and at their request eight pilots were withdrawn from R.A.F. Squadrons of fighter command. These pilots, together with certain Administrative Staff in the free french Headquarters, are now on their way to Russia via Middle East, wherethey will be reinforced by further pilots and a number of ground personnel fromSyria.[24504] d 2
226. At the request of Air Headquarters, West Africa, a Liaison Officerhas been attached to the Free French in French Equatorial Africa to advise on training and operational matters. This Officer, although directly responsible to air Headquarters, West Africa, will co-operate with No. 20 Military Mission.Two R.A.F. Officers are also being attached for operation liaison duties to theFree French at Pointe Noire and Douala, where the G.R. Anson nights will be stationed. The number of Ansons to be allotted to the Free French for coastalpatrol work has been increased from 6 to 8, three to operate from Pointe Noireand three from Douala, each station holding one aircraft in reserve. It is hopedthat all the aircraft will be ready for despatch to West Africa early in October.227. The Air Assignments Sub-Committee have approved the allocation of5 Lockheed Lodestars to the Free French for use in French Equatorial africa and Syria, two to be delivered in October, two in January 1943 and one inMarch 1943. Although not fully satisfying the demands of the Free french authorities, the, release of these five aircraft will go a long way towards meeting communication requirements in these territories. In addition, 20Monocoupe aircraft (two-seater single-engined light communication aircraft witha range of about 600 miles) will be made available for communications in Syria.228. As a result of General Valin&apos;s recent conversations with theA.O.C.-in-C, Middle East, six Blenheims Vs are being handed over to the free french Air Force for use in the Chad.Morale.229. Morale of aircrews in the United Kingdom remains high, and that of ground personnel has shown great improvement. The latter worked tirelesslyduring the Dieppe operation to ensure the serviceability of their aircraft.Training.230. * During the Quarter under review 15 Free French entered Initial Training Wing.9 Free French entered Elementary Air Navigators&apos; School.9 Free French qualified as Service Pilots.3 Free French entered schools of Technical Training.17 Free French pupil pilots        Left tho United Kingdom to complete1 Free French pupil navigator )    training in Canada.Polish Air Force.Order of Battle (see also Appendix II).231.

Although Polish Bomber Squadrons have in the past shown a tendency to bomb from too great a height, this has been largely overcome and bombingheights now approach the average levels of their Group.Fighter Command.236. For the part played by Polish Fighter Squadrons in the combined operation against Dieppe in August, see paragraph 216.
Coastal Command.237. During the quarter under review, 304 Squadron has been employed in anti-submarine patrols, with the following exceptions : (a) Seven aircraft operated with Bomber Command in a heavy attack onBremen on the 25th-26th June, 1942.(&amp;) Two raids on enemy shipping at La Pallice and Bordeaux.238. Of the successes reported for this Squadron, the following are the morenotable : August 13, 1942. Attack on enemy submarine by one aircraft.Crew congratulated by A.O.C.-in-C, Coastal Command.September 2, 1942. Attack by one aircraft on a surfacedU-boat. Two depth charges exploded alongside conning tower and deckraked with machine-gun fire. Aircraft left U-boat down by the bows andwith definite list to port.September 16, 1942. One aircraft when attacked by 6 enemy aircraft(Ju. 88s.) succeeded in destroying one and in probably destroying two.Aircraft returned safely to base although considerably damaged. Crewcongratulated by A.O.C.-in-C, Coastal Command.239. It is reported that, although individuals in 304 Squadron have donewell, the Squadron as a whole is poor and not up to the standard required, whilst the morale is not very high.240. A number of individual members of crews have very recently been replaced by Polish aircrew personnel from Bomber Command and it is hoped thatthis will bring about the required improvement.A rmy Co-operation Command.241. During August, one of the three Lysander flights of 309 (A.C.)Squadron was re-equipped with Mustang aircraft.   (Fighter-Reconnaissance.)242. This squadron has not taken part in operations during the quarterunder review.243. In July 1942, the initial training of Polish airmen was transferred from No. 12 Initial Training &quot;Wing, St. Andrews, to Polish Initial TrainingSquadron in R.A.F. Station, Brighton. The Squadron is commanded by a PolishOfficer and has been established for a Polish population of 250. Training isbeing carried out satisfactorily.244. In the same month the Technical Training Section of the R.A.F.Polish Depot, Blackpool, was transferred to R.A.F. Station, Ffalton, where it hasbeen established under a Polish Commanding Officer as the Polish technical training School, with capacity for 525 pupils. This move has greatly facilitatedtraining and improved morale.245. The responsibility for the operational training of replacement crewsfor No. 304 Polish Squadron will shortly be transferred from No. 18 (P) O.T.U.(Bomber Command) to No. 6 O.T.U. (Coastal Command) in which a Polish flightwill be established.246.   During the quarter year 247. In addition, the following- training has been carried out in No. 309 (P)Army Co-operation Squadron, which is still not actively engaged : Training.Hours flown 1,373 by day, 17-9 by night.38 live shoots for artillery.19 gas spray sorties.
60 reconnaissance sorties in various formations.3,162 photographs taken for British and Polish Units.10 pilots have completed at No. 41 O.T.U. Operational Training onMustang aircraft (with which one flight of six aircraft was re-equipped inAugust) and three of these pilots have been attached to No. 26 Squadron to gain experience, one taking part in operations.All ground personnel of the Fighter-Reconnaissance Flight and half theservicing echelon have completed conversion courses on Mustang aircraft.These ccurses were arranged by Technical Training Command.14 pilots and observers have completed a short navigation course atCranage.Recruiting.Polish A ir Force Mission in North A merica.248.   Recruiting from this source has virtually ceased.   Only three aircrewvolunteers were recruited during the period under review.249. Polish Air Force personnel of United States citizenship recruited bythis mission have been afforded facilities to apply for transfer to the UnitedStates forces in this country, and 46 applications are receiving the considerationof the United States authorities.Polish personnel ex Riissia for the Polish Air Force.250. By agreement with the Polish Army authorities, the number of polish Air Force personnel who commenced to arrive in United Kingdom earlyin June 1942 ex Russia is being supplemented from Polish Army volunteersup to a total of 1,500. Of this total approximately 1,300 have so far beenaccepted for service with the R.A.F. in the proportion of 35 per cent, aircrewto 65 per cent, ground personnel.251. A further contingent of Polish Air Force personnel, consisting of13 officers and 150 airmen, is on its way to this country from the Middle East.This personnel was originally earmarked to form a Polish CommunicationsSquadron in- Russia which, however, never materialised.Transfer of Polish Army personnel from the Middle East.252. It has now been decided that a further 2,000 Polish Army personnel are to be transferred from the Middle East to the Polish Air Force in the UnitedKingdom. Of these, 1,200 are to be selected&apos; for aircrew training and 800 forground duties.   Selection is to commence forthwith in the Middle East.Policy, Polish Bomber Squadrons.253. The future policy for the employment and re-equipment of the fourbomber squadrons has recently been decided on as follows : 254. No. 304 Squadron, which has been temporarily attached to Coastalfrom Bomber Command, is now to remain in Coastal Command where it willcontinue to be employed on general reconnaissance duties.255. The three other bomber squadrons are to remain in Bomber command and will operate at reduced rates of effort until such time as their crew positionjustifies their return to full-scale operations.256.   These three squadrons are to remain equipped with Wellingtons(medium -bomber) for the time being, but it is the intention that they shall beare-equipped during the first half of 1943.257. Subject to the crew and aircraft situation at the time, the re-equipment programme will either be for two squadrons to re-arm with heavy bombers andone with Bermudas (day bomber), or one with heavy bombers and two withBermudas.Morale.258. Except in the case of No. 304 Squadron (see paragraph 237), thereports received from Operational Commands indicate that the high standardof morale is being maintained in the Polish Air Force squadrons.General.259. The formation of a new Polish Air Force unit has been approvedwith effect the 1st November. 1942.    This unit, which will be located at
Blackpool, will be known as the Deputy Inspectorate of the Polish Air Force,and the Polish Officer Commanding will be responsible direct to the PolishInspector-General in London.260. The unit will be administered under Polish military law and willembrace many of the activities hitherto carried out by the Royal Air ForcePolish Depot, Blackpool. The Royal Air Force will provide liaison personnel and essential services.Royal Dutch Naval Air Service.Operations.   (See also Appendix IV.)261. The squadron has been employed mainly on strikes, patrols and air-searescue work during which only 10 per cent, of sorties were non-effective. Adirect hit was obtained on an enemy merchant vessel on the 9th September.Order of Battle.   (See also Appendix II.)262. A Dutch Naval squadron armed with Catalinas has been formed inthe Indian Ocean and is known as No. 321 (Dutch) Squadron. It was formed from personnel and aircraft evacuated from the Netherlands East Indies andit was brought up to the equivalent of two Catalina squadrons by the additionof 12 Catalina IIIAs, purchased by the Dutch Government in the United States.The aircraft establishment of the squadron is 12 I.E. and 6 I.R. Catalinas.Recruiting.283. During the period 25 Dutch Naval cadets have been accepted foraircrew training and enlisted in the R.A.F.V.R.Morale.264. Morale remains high. The re-arming of No. 320 Squadron with acomplete establishment of Hudson VI aircraft has contributed to the contentmentof the crews.Royal Dutch Army Aviation (R.A.F.Y.R.).Recruiting.265. Three Dutch engineers and two glider instructors have been commisioned into the R.A.F.V.R. and ten volunteers for aircrew training arebeing accepted every month.Morale.266.   Morale remains high.Training.   (For both Services.)267.   Sixty-one Dutch have entered I.T.W.&apos;s during the period under review.Czechoslovak Air Force.Operations.   (See also Appendix IV.)Coastal Command.268. No. 311 (Czech) Squadron has been employed regularly on anti-submarine sweeps in the Bay of Biscay. It has carried out several bombing raids on enemy shipping off the west coast of France and one on a town on the North coast of Germany and has sent seven aircraft to attack a tanker at La Palliceand six aircraft to attack shipping in harbour at Bordeaux. On the night ofthe 25th-26th June, 13 aircraft operated with Bomber Command against Bremen.269. During the period, nine enemy submarines were attacked by individualaircraft of this Squadron. Headquarters Coastal Command claim that all were damaged, eight severely and that two were probably destroyed. On two of theseoccasions congratulations were received from the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Coastal Command.270. Aircraft of the Squadron flying singly also had a number of heavy and successful engagements with enemy aircraft, and one when attacked by&apos; fourJu. 88s, destroyed one, damaged another and fought off the remainder. For thisoutstanding performance the pilot received the congratulations of the Air OfficerCommanding-in-Chief, Coastal Command.
Fighter Command.   (See also Appendices IV and V.)271. The part played by Czechoslovak Fighter Squadrons in the combined operations against Dieppe in August is referred to in paragraph 218.Morale.272. Headquarters, Coastal Command, report that No. 311 Squadron hassettled down happily in Coastal Command and has embarked on operations with enthusiasm, showing a very thorough attention to the details of operational andtactical instructions. The Squadron has been most successful in all its operations and shown an urgent desire to co-operate; it is making an important contributionto Allied counter-measures against the U-boat. Morale in squadrons of bothPoastal and Fighter Command is very good throughout.Recruiting.273. During the period 9 officers were transferred from Czechoslovak army for aircrew training, and 37 other ranks from the Czechoslovak Army or civiljlife have been accepted into the Czechoslovak Air Force. Two airmen have beenenlisted in Canada.274. Negotiations for the transfer to the Czech Air Force of nearly200 Czechoslovak Army personnel in the Middle East, mainly for aircrew training,have been concluded. They are expected to leave the Middle East aboutmid-October.The Future of No. 311 (Czech) Squadron.275. It has been decided that this Squadron shall remain in coastal command for an indefinite period. Its return to Bomber Command will be thesubject of discussion some time during 1943. During the period No. 1429 CzechOperational Training Flight became merged in No. 27 Operational Training Unit.It is shortly to be transferred to No. 6 O.T.U., where it will be established as the czech Flight.Training.276.   During the quarter :  37 Czechs entered Initial Training Wing.11 Czechs entered Elementary Air Navigators&apos; School.14 Czechs entered Signals School.15 Czechs entered Air Gunnery School.16 Qualified as Service Pilots.7 Entered Schools of Technical Training.33 Czech pupil pilots have been sent to Canada to complete their training.Royal Norwegian Air Force.Order of Battle.   (See Appendix II.)277. No. 330 (Norwegian) Squadron is to be established at 6 -t- 3 CatalinaIIIA and 6 Northrop float planes.Operations.   (See Appendix IV.)278. The part played by No. 331 and 332 (Norwegian) Fighter squadrons in the combined operations against Dieppe in August is referred to in Part I.No. 330 Squadron, based on Iceland, is being engaged on general reconnaissance and anti-submarine patrolling. Ten enemy aircraft were sighted during the.period, of which three were attacked, and three enemy submarines were sighted,two of which were attacked.Morale,279. Morale remains very high. The successes obtained by No. 331 and332 Squadrons in the combined operation against Dieppe have created a consider-able pride of achievement in these two Squadrons.Recrxdting.280. Recruiting continues, but on a smaller scale than hitherto, escape from Norway becoming increasingly difficult.
Training.281. 13 Norwegian fighter pilots are being trained in operational training units in the United Kingdom, 51 Norwegians are receiving Service flying training in Royal Air Force Transferred Schools in Canada and approximately60 pupils are in Elementary Flying Training in the Royal Norwegian Air ForceSchool at Toronto.282. Ten Norwegians have entered Signals Schools in the United Kingdomand others are being given elementary Wireless training by the NorwegianAuthorities, both in the United Kingdom and in Norwegian Schools at Toronto.General.283. Arrangements have been made for three pilots and three observers tobe attached to Operational Squadrons of Bomber Command equipped with heavy bomber aircraft, and for three pilots to be attached to Operational Squadronsequipped with light bomber aircraft.Belgian Air Force.Operations.   (See also Appendix IV.)284. The part played by No. 350 Belgian Squadron in the combined operation against Dieppe in August is described in Paragraph 221. Throughout,the period this Squadron has been employed on convoy patrol, sweeps andBomber escorts.Morale.285.   Morale remains high.Training.286.   During the period : -46 Belgians entered Initial Training Wing.21 Belgians qualified as Service pilots.11 Belgians entered Schools of Technical Training.8 Belgian pupil pilots have left for Canada to complete their training.Recruiting.287. Further trained Belgian Air Force personnel have escaped to thiscountry during the period under review, 4 of whom have been commissionedand 7 enlisted in the R.A.F.V.R.288.   Commissions have been granted to Belgian officers as follows : Two in the Meteorological Branch.One in the Medical Branch.One in the Technical Branch.Five in the General Duties Branch as aircrew under training.289. Thirty-six recruits from civil life and from the Belgian army have beenenlisted for training as ground personnel.290.   Forty-one Belgian army personnel have accepted for aircrew training.Royal Hellenic Air Force.Operations.291. No. 355 Fighter Squadron and No. 13 G.R. Squadron are stilloperational in Middle East Command. It is expected that the strength of thelatter will be brought up to 16 IE. by the end of this quarter year.Training.292. On the 31st July there were 139 Greek pupils awaiting or undergoingtraining in Southern Rhodesia (R.A.T.G.).293. As a result of the visit paid by Group Captain Vilos to R.A.T.G. tosettle the grievances of 72 pupils who refused to participate in training, the[24504] e
great majority of the dissatisfied returned to duty. Five officers were sent to palestine for court martial, fourteen others were dismissed the service but have since been rehabilitated in Middle East.M or ale.294. Except for the incident referred to in the previous paragraph, moralehas been good.General.295. In the face of strong objections on the part of the Greeks, the proposalto bring them into the R.A.F.V.R. has been dropped. An agreement on the linesof that for the organisation of the Norwegian Air Force is now being negotiated.Yugoslav Air Force.Operations296. No Yugoslav personnel have been used on active service since thedispute over the Yugoslav High Command.Training.297. There are at present twenty-five trainees in Southern Rhodesia,fifteen of whom are undergoing flying training. The remainder are awaitingcourses in the Union.Recruiting.298. The Yugoslav Government hope to get about 150 recruits in the Unionfrom their nationals resident there. There are also in the Union 2,000 italian prisoners of war of Slovene origin from whom suitable air force recruits are tobe selected.Morale. .299.   Morale is as good as may be expected in view of recent events.General.300. The loss of some 200 dissident personnel, the pick of the YugoslavAir Force, as the result of the crisis over the High Command, has left theair force so depleted that a revision of the Yugoslav Air Force Agreement isnecessitated. It is hoped to persuade the Yugoslav Government that the only practical solution of the problem at the moment is the training of their personnelas individuals in the R.A.F.V.R. until such time as there are sufficient qualifiedpilots and ground personnel once more to form a Yugoslav Flight with a BritishSquadron.Great George Street, S.W.1,October 1942.
