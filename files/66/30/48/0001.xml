THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1942.SECRET. Copy No.-W.P. (42) 518.November 9, 1942.WAR CABINET.RELATIONS WITH GENERAL DE GAULLE: ADMINISTRATION OFMADAGASCAR.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Prime Minister and I spoke to General de Gaulle yesterday aboutthe operations in North Africa. As a result General de Gaulle declared himselfwilling to come to an agreement with any French authority fighting on the sideof the United Nations. He broadcast last night a strong appeal to Frenchmenin North Africa to support the Allies.2. We now wish, both in order to strengthen General de Gaulle and to allaysuspicion in the minds of Frenchmen, to proceed immediately with the arrange-ments for handing over the civil administration of Madagascar to the french national Committee.3. The Committee have agreed that Madagascar should remain permanentlypart of the East African Command. They propose, however, that the british general Officer Commanding, Islands Area, should retain the command in the island itself only until Fighting France is in a position to take a predominantshare in the defence of Madagascar.4. Our own proposals give the National Committee &quot; the right to raise and maintain land forces &apos;&apos; in Madagascar, which would be armed, trained and equipped in agreement with us. They would be placed at the disposal of theBritish General Officer Commanding if required for the defence of the island.5. It is unlikely that the Fighting French will be in. a position to take overthe defence of the island for a long time to come, but we must, of course, lookahead. If and when the case arises, will there be any serious risk in handing over the command to them ? The risk, whatever it be, seems to me to be outweighed by the advantage of agreement now with General de Gaulle. The fighting french hold the independent command in French Equatorial Africa. In this instance they would hold the command in Madagascar under General Platt.6.   I should be glad to know my colleagues&apos; mind on this point.7. Whatever we may say here and now, it would be difficult politically torefuse to allow the French to take over the defence of their own territory should they later be in a position to do so, particularly if, as is possible, we have to dealthen not with the French National Committee but with a provisional Governmentin North Africa.8. We have suggested to General de Gaulle that a communique in general terms should be issued at once. A draft is attached embodying the suggestions of the National Committee.A. E.Foreign Office, November 9, 1942.11894   [24599]
