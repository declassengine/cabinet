S. C.November 2, 1942.(*) VV.M. (4-2) 145th Conclusions, Minute 2.ANNEX.Facts as regards Herr Hess&apos;s Arrival in Great Britain so far as known to HisMajesty&apos;s Government.Herr Hess flew to Great Britain in a Me. 110, from which he landed byparachute in the evening of the 10th May, 1941, at Eaglesham in Scotland.He was wearing the uniform of a captain in the German Air Force. He gavehis name as Alfred Horn and stated to the Home Guard and the Police thathe was on a &quot; special mission &apos;&apos; to see the Duke of Hamilton, and that he had intended to land at Dungavel, 12 miles distant from the spot where he landed.The prisoner was taken to Maryhill Barracks and amongst his possessionswere found photographs of himself and of a small boy, also the visiting cards of dr. Karl Haushofer and Dr. Albrecht Haushofer, his son. No other documentsor identifications were found on the prisoner.On Sunday, the 11th May, at 10 a.m., Wing-Commander the Duke ofHamilton arrived at Maryhill Barracks and visited the prisoner with theinterrogating officer and the Military Officer on guard.At the prisoner&apos;s request the latter two officers withdrew. He then statedto the Wing-Commander that the latter had lunched in his house in Berlin atthe time of the Olympic games in 1936 and added : &quot;I am Rudolf Hess.&quot; TheWing-Commander had no recollection of the prisoner and was not aware thathe had ever seen or met Rudolf Hess.The prisoner then proceeded : &quot;I am on a mission of humanity. The Fuhrerdoes not want to defeat England and wants to stop fighting.&quot; His friendHaushofer, he stated, had told him that the Wing-Commander was an Englishmanwho would understand his point of view. He had tried to arrange a meeting inLisbon.* He had three times before tried to fly to Dungavel, the first time being in December 1940, but had been turned back by weather or various other reasons.* note. The Duke of Hamilton had in fact received a letter dated 28rd September fromHaushofer suggesting a meeting in Lisbon but without any reference to the presence of Hess.This letter was brought to the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government nt the time of its arrival.As Sir Archibald Sinclair stated in the House of Commons, the Duke&apos;s conduct in relation toRudolf Hess had been in every respect honourable and proper.11886   [24568]
He did not want to come during the time of British successes in Libya lestit should appear that it was the weakness of Germany which prompted the flight,but that now Germany had had some success there he was glad to come.He stressed that his presence showed his sincerity and the German willingnessfor peace.His main theme was that the Fiihrer was convinced that Germany would winsooner or later; that he (the prisoner) wanted to stop the unnecessaryslaughter. He asked the Wing-Commander to get together the leading membersof his party to talk over things with a view to making peace proposals. He thenstated that he could tell him what the Fuhrer&apos;s peace terms would be. The Wing-Commander pointed out that there was now only one party in Great Britain.The Wing-Commander immediately flew to London and reported this con-versation, stating that, though he could not be sure, he believed the prisoner was,in fact. Rudolf Hess.Mr. Kirkpatrick of the Foreign Office, who had during the period of his official duties in Berlin before the war become acquainted with Hess, was at onceflown up to Scotland to identify the prisoner. He had three interviews, on the13th, 14th and loth May. At the first of these he confirmed that the prisconerwas Rudolf Hess.During these interviews Hess further elaborated the object of his visit. Hestressed the enormous power of Germany in the air and in U-boats, which latter,he stated, would grow much greater. He affirmed the certainty of England&apos;sdefeat by blockade, if not very quickly, in the course of two or three years.He expressed his horror at the prospect of the prolongation of the struggle.He had come, he said, without the knowledge of the Fiihrer to convince responsiblepersons that, since England could not win, the. wisest course was to make peace atonce.He gave his word of honour that the Fiihrer had never entertained anydesigns against the British Empire, nor had he ever aspired to world domination.The Ftihrer would sincerely regret the collapse of the British Empire. hitler had declared to him as recently as the 3rd May that he had no oppressive demands to make on England.The solution which Hess put forward was as follows :- (i) That Germany should be given a free hand in Europe;(ii) That England should have a free hand in the British Empire, exceptthat the ex-German colonies should be returned to Germany;(iii) That Russia should be included in Asia, but that Germany had certaindemands to make of Russia which would have to be satisfied either by negotiation or as the result of war. There was, however, no truth in the rumours that the Fiihrer contemplated an early attack on russia.(iv) That Germany could not leave the Iraqis in the lurch, they had foughtfor Germany and Iraq would, therefore, have to be evacuated;(v) The peace agreement would have to contain a provision for the reciprocal indemnification of British and German Nationals, whose property had been expropriated as the result of war.(vi) The proposal could only be considered on the understanding that it wasnegotiated by Germany with an English Government other than thepresent British Government. Mr. Churchill, who had planned thewar since 1936, and his colleagues, who had lent themselves to his war&apos; policy, were not persons with whom the Fiihrer would negotiate.Hess concluded by emphasising that the Fiihrer really wanted a permanentunderstanding with Great Britain on a basis which preserved the BritishEmpire intact. His own flight was intended to give Great Britain a chance of opening conversations without loss of prestige. If this chance were to be rejected it would be the Fiihrer&apos;s duty to destroy Great Britain utterly and tokeep the country after the war in a state of permanent subjection.These so-called &apos;&apos; terms &apos;&apos; were restated in a document in writing signed by Hess dated the 10th June. The only new point made in this document wasthe provision that a simultaneous armistice and peace must be concluded with italy.The only further persons who interviewed Hess, apart from those responsiblefor guarding him or attending to his health, were two members of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, the first on the 9th June and the second upon the 9th September.
These interviews were with the object of ascertaining any information of value that Hess might have to give, and to ascertain whether there was anythingfurther of interest that could be found out as to the state of affairs in Germany.It was, of course, made clear to Hess that there was no question whateverof any talks or negotiations of any kind taking place with the Fiihrer or hisGovernment.Hess has been dealt with as a prisoner of war since his arrival in thiscountry and will so continue to be treated till the end of the war. He has seenno visitors apart from those above mentioned.The following deductions which were made by the member of theGovernment who interviewed Hess on the 9th June are the best that can bemade from the information given by Hess.(a) Hess came on his own initiative.(b) He was under the impression that he was engaged upon a mission whichhad a considerable prospect of success, especially upon the anti-Bolshevik basis.(c) He believed there was a strong &quot;opposition&quot; party in this country which wanted to end the war and that he could get into.contact with it.(d) Hess&apos; plan was an attempt to reproduce Hitler&apos;s own mind as expressedin many conversations.(e) Hess had contemplated carrying out his mission ever since the fall ofFrance.On the 7th July, 1941, Hess wrote a long document entitled &quot; Germany-England from the Angle of the German-Bolshevik War &quot; a copy of which was handed to the Minister who interviewed him on the 9th September.This is a long argumentative document based upon the view that it is inEngland&apos;s interest to side with Germany against Bolshevism.
