NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.I. Our submarines and aircraft continue to inflict serious damage on enemy shipping in the Mediterranean.Only two ships are reported sunk by U-boats during the week. bad weather has restricted their operations in tKe Atlantic.One U-boat has been sunk and four promising attacks have been made.The Japanese Fleet in the Solomons area has been damaged by Allied air and surface attacks.Northern Waters.2. The Fighting French submarine Junon torpedoed a ship in TennholmFiord on the 18th. The ship was subsequently beached. On the following dayshe sank another ship in Saltfiord (entrance to Vest Fiord, Narvik area).Home Waters.3. During an attack by four enemy aircraft on the 16th, four naval bargeswere sunk and several damaged in Sharpham Reach, River Dart.Mediterranean.4. H.M. Submarines have reported the following attacks: Between the2nd&quot; and 10th October P. 211 torpedoed four ships in the Adriatic, two of whichwere subsequently beached. On the 20th she sank a ship with a deck cargo of motor transport to the north of Tripoli (L.). P. 37 torpedoed a 3,000-ton shipladen with petrol, and sank a coaster and a schooner off the coast of Tunis onthe ,8th and 9th. On the 19th she torpedoed a ship in a southbound convoy30 &quot;miles south of Lampion. Turbulent sank a small ship off Derna on the 8thand P. 43 sank an 8,000-ton ship, southbound and escorted off the south coast of Greece on the 10th. P. 42 was slightly damaged after carrying out an attackon a convoy S.W. of Lampedusa on the 19th.  ,5.   H.M. Corvette Gloxinia shot down an Me. 109 off Alexandria on the 15th.6. Naval aircraft from Malta torpedoed a ship off Pantellaria and attackedan escorted convoy off the Tunis coast; torpedoing one ship. A tanker was alsotorpedoed off Tripoli (L).   (See &quot;Air Situation.&quot;)During the week 24,158 tons of French merchant shipping have passed gibraltar eastbound under escort.Pacific.7. On the 15th enemy warships shelled the U.S. positions on the North coast of Guadalcanal Islands. United States M.T.B.&apos;s attacked these ships andprobably torpedoed one Japanese cruiser.8. On the 20th reconnaissance showed in the Buin-Shortlancl ai&apos;ea 32 ships,including one heavy, four light cruisers and 17 destroyers, and at Rabaul a smallnaval force with 41 merchant ships. Reinforcements, equal probably to one division, were known, to be on the way to Rabaul which may account&apos;for this large number of merchant ships. During the last few days two U.S. destroyershave been damaged by bombs.9. Up to the -18th October 57 Japanese ships of all types have been sunk or damaged in the Solomon Island area.10. During the night of the 14th/15th October U.S. positions on EspirituSanto Island, New Hebrides, were shelled by an enemy ship believed to be aU-boat.II. On the 15th U.S. aircraft damaged two Japanese destroyers N.W. ofof Kiska, Aleutian Island.Anti-Submarine Operations.12. H.M. destroyer Fame, escorting a homeward bound convoy, rammedand sank a U-boat on the 16th in mid-Atlantic.   Thirty-nine survivors were
-Ataken prisoner. On the following day the Norwegian Corvette Potentilla, another of the escorts, carried out a promising attack. H.M. Corvette Celandine, escortingan outward-bound convoys in mid-Atlantic, probably destroyed a U-boat onthe 16th.A Catalina and a Liberator aircraft each caused damage in attacks north-east of the Azores and to the west of the Bay of Biscay.Exclusive of ships and aircraft operating from the U.S.A., reports havebeen received of 14 other attacks by aircraft, and one by a surface craft duringthe week; seven of these attacks were made in mid-Atlantic, three north of theFaeroes, two south of Iceland (C), two in the Caribbean and one in the N.W.Approaches.Enemy Intelligence.German.13. Photographic reconnaissance of the Narvik area on the 21st showed theTirpitz, Scheer, Hipper and three destroyers under way exercising.In the Baltic tide Prinz Eugen is out of dock with her new stern fitted and ispresumed to be ready for service. Lutzow is still in dock and Scharnhorst is atGydnia.Italian.14. The slight increase in the Libyan traffic which was noted last week hasnot been maintained.Japanese.15. In the S.W, Pacific the Japanese have now obtained a superiority ofcarrier-borne aircraft, though they are still markedly inferior in shore-based aircraft. It is considered that the main building-up of the air strength is nowcompleted, though one converted aircraft-carrier is still being used for bringingaircraft from the Ambon area. Four enemy heavy cruisers and three light cruisers may be damaged.U-boats.16. There is still considerable activity in the North Atlantic, though some-what less than of late, and it is estimated that at present there are fewer U-boatsthan usual in the area south of Iceland (C). There are indications of anincrease in the number between the Azores and the Bay of Biscay. U-boats arestill operating near Capetown, and the second group may arrive there withinthe coming week. In the Freetown-Trinidad areas, shipping casualties have beenlight, but it is clear that U-boats are still present. Bad weather has undoubtedlyhampered their activity in.the North Atlantic, but there are still about 100U-boats at sea.Protection of Seaborne Trade.17. During the week ending 18th/19th, 935 ships have been convoyed. Ofthese 204 were in ocean convoys and 731 in British coastal convoys. One anti-aircraft ship, 52 destroyers (including one U.S. destroyer) and 84 sloops, cuttersand corvettes (including four U.S. cutters), were employed on escort duty.During the week 109 ships in three ocean convoys arrived in Home Waters.Six ships were sunk.18, Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending 17th October totalled 684,000 tons compared with 813,000 tons duringthe previous seven days and an average of 696,000 tons for the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports 201,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.19. Only three ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boats duringthe week. Of these, a straggler from an outward-bound convoy was sunk in mid-Atlantic; one ship was sunk north-east of Trinidad, and another, which was torpedoed off Trinidad, has reached port.A tanker was set on fire by aircraft in the Gulf of Suez on the 19th andsubsequently beached.In Northern Waters a Russian ship on British Government charter was mined in Yogorski Strait (south-east of Nova Zembla).
MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.Northern and Central Sectors.26. There has been fighting of minor importance at Rzhev and in the Orelarea, but elsewhere in the Northern and Central Sectors there has been littleactivity. The weather has deteriorated, and the roads are likely to becomedifficult.20. Reference last week&apos;s Resume, paragraph 3 the Caribou was aNewfoundland passenger ferry-ship of 2,222 tons. There were 136 killed ormissing.H.M. Destroyer Brilliant has picked up 267 survivors from the s.s. Oronsay,which was hit by four torpedoes and sank 400 miles S.W. of Freetown on the 9th.British Minelayrng.i:. Mining by surface craft took place off the East Coast and in northern waters.Aircraft laid mines during the week in the Bay of Biscay area, off the frisian Islands and in the Baltic.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.22. Enemy minelaying by aircraft took place on one night off Harwich.Minesweeping off the east coast of Iceland (C) has been carried out, a total of eight mines having been destroyed. Enemy aircraft shadowed the sweeping-operations.The mine totals to date are : acoustic 1,320, magnetic 2,708. 1,754 moored.The Russians have destroyed nine mines in the entrance to the White Sea.Enemy Merchant Shipping.23. In continuation of paragraph 22 of last week*s Resume, when Italyentered the war her tanker fleet totalled 101 ships of 441,389 tons, of which 41were,. and have remained, outside the Mediterranean. Of the 60 tankers inside the Mediterranean, five were requisitioned as Naval oilers, leaving 55 totalling181,291 tons for non-naval purposes. To this fleet Italy has since added 23 tankerstotalling 138,932 tons, of which nine Avere new vessels and 14 were acquiredthrough salvage or capture. The losses are reported to total 24 ships of132.803 tons. The Italian tanker tonnage available to the Axis in theMediterranean and the Black Sea on the 1st September, 1942. amounted, therefore,to 54 ships of 187,420 tons. The average amount of tonnage continuouslyimmobilised through marine and war damage is reported to be 25,000 tons, whichreduces the estimated available tonnage to 162,420 tons. Of this total only twotankers totalling 1,388 tons were in the Black Sea.vichy French Shipping.24. The 35 Allied ships now in French ports which are about to betransferred to the Axis Powers a^e reported to be composed of : 15 ex-Norwegianships of 65,257 tons (including four tankers totalling 36,934 tons); ten ex-greek ships of 30.645 tons and ten ex-Danish ships of 22,279 tons. It is believed that three or four of these ships have already left Marseilles for Italian ports, and that three ships are now being prepared for delivery to Italy. All the tankers are togo to Germany.Russian Intelligence.25. On the 19th, Russian submarines sank the Trelleborg Ferry steamerDeutschlancl, which was then carrying German troops. There are now only twoSwedish ferries left and services have been suspended.Russian destroyers and other craft have bombarded isolated points in the crimea. A submarine sank an enemy ship of 6,000 tons off the St. George&apos;s mouth of the Danube on the 10th.
Stalingrad Sector.27. The Russians have continued to attack both north and south of stalingrad, but it is not known what success they have had. After a short lull theGermans have renewed their offensive on Stalingrad itself, and claim that this isto be their decisive effort. They have made progress in the factory area in thenorthern part of the city and the situation has deteriorated, although there hasbeen no weakening of Russian resistance and the initial rate of progress has notbeen maintained.Caticasus Sector.28. The Germans appear to have made no further advance eastwardstowards Grozni. Heavy fighting has taken place south of Mozdok, but there isno evidence that the Germans have made any appreciable progress.They are making a determined effort to take Tuapse by advancing from threedirections. From the north-east and north they have made some progress,although they are still about 20 miles from the port. East of Novorossisk their third thrust has been held. In the whole area weather conditions tend to retardoperations.Summary.29. Hitler&apos;s promise that Stalingrad would fail, suggests that the germans will make every effort to take the city regardless of cost, and the vigour of thepresent attack strengthens this impression. Whatever the outcome of the fighting,the Germans have already been held up so long at Stalingrad that any majoroffensive further north is unlikely this year. A continuation of German pressuretowards Tuapse is to^be expected, and if Stalingrad falls the Germans are likelyto intensify their thrust towards Grozni.Egypt.&quot;30.   Patrol activity has continued along the whole front.Madagascar.31. After entering Ambositra on the 14th, our forces were delayed by bad weather. The bridging train arrived on the 15th and some progress was madeto the west and south on the 16th and 17th; roads were repaired.Continuing their advance, our troops captured several villages on the 19th,including Ivato, eight miles south of Ambositra. Approximately 700 prisonersAvere taken. By the 21st our advanced troops were some 25 miles south ofAmbositra.Far East.Burma.32. On the 17th a small force of our troops and guerillas inflictedcasualties on a Japanese force, strength unknown, which had penetrated intothe Chin Hills. The Japanese were reported using mortars and the guerillaswere forced to withdraw. This is the first occasion Japanese have been reportedactually in the Chin Hills and indicates a more aggressive policy on their part.The monsoon is now slackening off and fine weather can be expected from theend of October.South-west Pacific.33. In the Kokoda area (New Guinea) the Australian forces have made only slow progress since they reached Myola, ten miles from Kokoda, on the 8th.On the 21st they were some eight miles south of Kokoda.A small Australian force is operating in the Yodda Valley, about 20 miles north of Kokoda.South Pacific.34. Early on the morning of the 15th considerable Japanese forces coveredby naval units landed on the north coast of Guadalcanal Island, in the SolomonsGroup, west of the U.S. positions. . No report has been received of any offensivethrust by the enemy, but fighting has continued intermittently. The U.S. troops have been reinforced.
Intelligence.Burma,35. The Japanese strength in Burma is now estimated to be four divisions.One division is believed to be at Rangoon, one in Central Burma, one covering the Western frontier, and a fourth stationed around Myitkyina and along the burma Road.AIR SITUATION.General Review.36. A very successful daylight raid was made by a strong force ofLancasters on the Schneider Works at Le Creusot. and a heavy night attack was made on Cologne.Enemy aircraft continued their large-scale attacks on Malta and Spitfiresagain prevented many attacks and inflicted heavy casualties.Successful attacks were made on enemy shipping in the Mediterranean.United Kingdom.37. Fighter Command flew 1,041 defensive sorties by day (including sixby U.S. aircraft) and 206 by night.Enemy activity against this country was again on a small scale, and only52 aircraft flew overland by day and 16 by night. During the morning ofthe 19th, the enemy took advantage of low cloud and mist to operate 33 long-range bombers against targets in East Anglia.Our fighters destroyed six enemy aircraft, probably destroyed two and damaged three.  A.A. guns destroyed another.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.-&apos;38. Fighter, Bomber and Army Co-operation Commands despatched 610.160 and 16 offensive sorties respectively, which compare with 797, 14 and 6 lastweek. In addition, 107 U.S. Bomber and 84 U.S. Fighter sorties, were flown;the comparable figures last week were 115 and 79.The most ambitious daylight operation yet undertaken by Bomber command aircraft was the despatch of 94 Lancasters to attack the Schneider Works atLe Creusot (45 miles S.W. of Dijon), an operation which entailed a roundflight of about 1,720 miles, of which 660 were over enemy-occupied territory.These works, which are the French equivalent of Krupps of Essen, manufacturearmaments (including artillery of the heaviest calibre, heavy armour plating and armoured fighting vehicles) and locomotives. The majority of the products arenow being manufactured to German pattern. The works are divided into three main and separate sections the Le Creusot Steel Works, the Breuil Steel works and the Processing Shops the whole covering an area approximately 1-1 mileslong by f mile wide.The weather over France was cloudy but clear over the target; the attackbegan within one minute of the time ordered and the whole operation was overin 6-1 minutes. Identification presented little difficulty and 81 aircraft attackedfrom about 5,000 feet, dropping 256 x 1,000-lb. bombs and 2,896 x 30-lb.incendiaries. The attack was a complete surprise, no enemy aircraft and verylittle flak being encountered. From reports, it seems that the rolling mills, steelworks, turbine buildings, foundry machine shops and other buildings were left in flames; towards the end of the attack, the whole area had become completelyenveloped in smoke.. A thorough visual reconnaissance on the day followingconfirmed that all the plants appeared to have been hit and that some buildingshad been completely demolished. Very little damage was noticed inresidential areas.Six of the Lancasters were detailed to the transformer station at Montehanin,just south of Le Creusot. These attacked from below 500 feet, direct hits resulting in many vivid blue flashes.One aircraft was lost over Montchanin, being seen to crash into a building.The remainder returned safely. An aircraft, which had to turn back early owingto engine trouble, was attacked, off Brest by three Arado Seaplanes, two of whichit destroyed.Another large-scale operation was attempted when 90 U.S. bombers(24 Liberators and 66 Fortresses) were despatched to attack submarine pens in
the Keroman Port area at Lorient. A deterioration in visibility unfortunatelyforced 69 aircraft to turn back before reaching the French coast, and the 21which proceeded were engaged in a running combat with about 36 F.W. 190s,from the coast to the target.Fifteen aircraft attacked, dropping 30 x 2,000-lb. bombs, and numerous bursts were seen on the central pen, the southern pen (which is still under construction),and in an area which includes the slips to the south of these pens. Nine enemy fighters were destroyed in combat, six probably destroyed and six damaged for theloss of three Fortresses.As a diversion to the Lorient attack, a further 17 Fortresses were despatched to bomb Maupertus Aerodrome on the Cherbourg Peninsula. Bad weather againinterfered but bursts were seen in the dispersal area to the south-east of the aerodrome.Escort cover and support to the above operation were provided by 19squadrons of fighters (including two squadrons of U.S. Lightnings), but &quot;these were not engaged in combat.Targets in Germany were attacked by Mosquitos and Army Co-operationMustangs, the latter being the first single-engined fighters based on thiscountry to carry out harassing operations over Germany. These attacked canaltraffic at Meppen, a factory and a gasometer at Lathan and a hutted camp nearAschendorf. The Mosquitos, of which one is missing, bombed Bremen, Minden.Varelhafen (near Wilhelmshaven), Lingen and factories at Norden and. Nordhorn.In Holland, three low-level attacks by a total of ten Mosquitos were made onthe Stork Engineering and Diesel Engine Works at Hengelo; the glow of firesthrough dense brown smoke was seen as well as hits on important parts of thefactory. Other Mosquitos bombed the aerodrome at Leeuwarden, where buildings and the perimeter track were hit, and the Port area of Den Helder. Mustangs&quot; shot-up &quot; gasometers at Katwijk and Vlieland, as well as locomotives and rolling-stock elsewhere in Holland. At least six small coastal vessels off the dutch coast were damaged.Spitfires carried out similar operations over northern France, destroying ordamaging at least four locomotives.Shipping in the harbours at Havre and Lezardrieux was attacked by Bostonsand Hurricane bombers respectively. At the former, bombs were seen to burst onthe quays, buildings and near No. 1 Dry-Dock. At Lezardrieux, two trawlers and an E-boat were damaged.   One of the escorting Spitfires is missing.The Photographic Reconnaissance Unit flew 36 sorties, from which two air-craft are missing, and a further 18 sorties were flown by aircraft of army co-operation Command.Night.39. Bomber Command activity against land targets was severely restricted by weather, and only one operation, when 289 aircraft were despatched, wascarried out.  Last week&apos;s sorties totalled 347.The target was Cologne, which was attacked by 237 aircraft; 216 tons ofH.E. (including three x 8,000 lb. and 69 x 4,000 lb.) and 257 tons of LBs. (includ-ing six x 4,000 lb.) were dropped. Weather over the area varied considerablyduring the operation, with heavy cloud prevailing during the main weight of the attack. Numerous fires, some of them large, were seen in the town, and many others were observed scattered on both sides of the river. Two 4,000-lb. incen-diaries were seen to ignite in the town. Eighteen aircraft failed to return andanother crashed in this country.Leaflets were dropped over France by five aircraft of Bomber command and six of Army Co-operation Command.Coastal Operations.40. Coastal Command despatched 337 sorties, of which 190 were on anti-U-boat operations, three on mine-laying, and ten on convoy escorts. bomber command despatched 30 aircraft on patrols in the Bay of Biscay area: (Resultsof anti-U-boat operations are summarised under &quot; Naval Situation.&quot;) Aircraftunder Fighter Command flew 525 sorties (including 12 by U.S. aircraft)on shipping-protection patrols, and a further 75 offensive sorties against enemy shipping.A 3,000-ton ship off South Norway was hit by a torpedo from a Hampden.and a night-bombing attack by four Hudsons on shipping off Boulogne resultedin a hit on a vessel of about 4,500 tons.
From patrols in the Bay of Biscay area six aircraft are missing andanother failed to return from an anti-U-boat patrol north of Scotland. Spitfiresdestroyed a Ju.88 off Dunkirk and a further three were damaged off our coastsby Beaufighters.Forty-eight aircraft of Bomber Command, of which five were lost, laid 117sea-mines; a further three were laid by naval Swordfish operating under coastal command.Mediterranean.Egypt and Libya.41. Air operations over the battle area were again restricted owing to heavy sandstorms. Allied aircraft flew 1.157 sorties compared with 1,617 lastweek.Our fighters maintained reconnaissance and offensive patrols over the battle area and provided protection for shipping oft&apos; the Delta and in the Gulf of Suez.Beaufighters on offensive patrols between Crete and Libya attacked Ju.52s someof which were towing gliders. At least two Ju.52s were destroyed. OneBeaufighter crashed in the sea.Fighter-bombers continued their attacks on enemy landing-grounds,mechanical transport, camps, gun positions and the coastal railway. A largenumber of vehicles were destroyed or damaged, several aircraft on the groundwere hit, casualties were inflicted on working parties, and at least three railwayengines were destroyed or seriously damaged. A W/T station was alsodestroyed.British Liberators and U.S. Liberators and Fortresses made daylight attacks on shipping at Benghazi and Tobruk, on railway sidings and barracks at mersa matruh and on mechanical transport between Tobruk and Bardia. At Tobrukseveral ships were hit.Landing grounds at El Daba, Qotaifiya (west of El Daba) and Fuka were heavily attacked in daylight by Baltimores. Bostons and U.S. Mitchells,escorted by Allied fighters. Bursts were observed in blast shelters containingaircraft and among dispersed aircraft. Several large fires were started,including one in a stores dump. ,Tobruk Harbour was attacked on four nights by a total of about 100Wellingtons and five Halifaxes. One ship was probably hit and near misseswere obtained on four others. Other Wellingtons bombed Sollum and landing grounds at Bardia, Sidi Barrani and Fuka. Sidi Haneish was bombed by 17Bostons. A landing ground west of El Daba was bombed by Bostons and naval Albacores.Enemy activity was on a moderate scale. Fighter-bombers carried outsmall-scale attacks against our landing grounds, A.A. positions and mechanical transport. Three long-range bombers operated over the Gulf of Suez and sank a tanker off Ras Gharib.Malta.42. In the week ending the 19th October our aircraft flew 873 sortiescompared with 1,834 by the enemy.Small formations of Ju. 88s, He. Ills and Me. 109 fighter-bombers, heavilyescorted by German and Italian fighters, continued their attacks against Malta.Many of the formations were intercepted by our fighters north of the Island anddispersed before making land-fall, the bombers being forced to jettison theirbombs in the sea. Bombs were dropped on Takali, Hal Far and Luqa Aerodromes.Takali was rendered temporarily unserviceable, but only slight damage was caused to the others. One of our aircraft was destroyed on the ground, and sevenwere damaged.  At Kalafrana the engine repair hangar was damaged.Towards the end of the week there was a noticeable reduction in the numberof long-range bombers employed, whilst fighter effort showed an increase.Our fig-hters, although outnumbered, destroyed 32 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 16 and damaged 43. A further three were destroyed by A.A. and two were shot down by our Intruders over Sicily. We lost 15 Spitfires, but eight pilotsare safe.Since the offensive on Malta began on the 10th, enemy aircraft casualties areas follows : Destroyed ...      ............      120Probably Destroyed     ......      ...      ...        53Damaged ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      149We lost 31 Spitfires, but 17 pilots are safe.
Gibraltar.43. On the 20th and 21st a total of six Italian aircraft approachedGibraltar. Bombs fell harmlessly on the east side of the Rock and on Spanishterritory.Sea Communications.44. Photographs reveal that the 7,000-ton ship reported in last week&apos;resume as having been torpedoed by a naval Albacore east of Horns (L) wasbeached near the harbour. A further attack was therefore made on the ship byan Albacore, but results were not observed.Two naval Swordfish and an Albacore torpedoed a 4,000-ton ship 30 miles .N.E. of Pantellaria, and left the ship down by the stern.A convoy consisting of two 6,000-ton ships and five destroyers on a south-westerly course was attacked by naval Swordfish and Albacores off the coast of tunis. One ship was torpedoed. Later the convoy was bombed by Wellingtonsand one ship was hit.A 8,000-ton tanker, escorted by two destroyers and two torpedo-boats, coursenorth-east, was attacked and torpedoed by a Wellington east of Corfu. Anothertanker of about 5,000 tons, escorted by three destroyers, course south, was torpedoed by naval Swordfish 76 miles N.N.W. of Tripoli (L).A Wellington fired a torpedo at a ship 35 miles N.W. of Apollonia. Owingto an effective smoke screen the result was not observed.A schooner, believed to be carrying petrol, was sunk by Beaufighters southof Crete.Russian Front.45. Owing to the deterioration in weather conditions, there was a consider-able decrease in the scale of air activity on the Russian front, except in theStalingrad area.In the Far North, Russian bombers raided Petsamo and Kirkenes.In Stalingrad, enemy troops in the occupied parts of the town werecontinuously bombed and machine-gunned.In the Caucasus, the Russians maintained a brisk activity, especially in theMozdok-Terek sectors, where bombers and fighters continuously attacked enemyland forces.  Krasnodar Aerodrome was raided three times.Aircraft of the Black Sea Fleet attacked Feodosia, in the Crimea, andNovorossisk.The German Air Force heavily attacked Russian troops in Stalingrad and communications on and to the east&quot; of the Volga. Elsewhere German aircraft operated mainly against artillery positions, troop concentrations and supplycentres. Railways in rear of most sectors of the front were attacked and it is claimed that much Russian railway stock was destroyed.During the week ending the 17th October, the Russians claim to have destroyed 130 German aircraft against 49 of their own.Burma.46. Twelve escorted U.S. Mitchells (operating from China) bombed Lashiotown and aerodrome. The aerodrome runways were hit and fires started in thesouth-west part of the town.Blenheims bombed road vehicles at Kan, and targets at Monywa where alarge building was (hit.U.S. aircraft machine-gunned barracks at Lonkin (70 miles W.N.W. ofMyitkyina); bombed and machine-gunned stations and villages north ofMyitkyina, and maintained continuous defensive patrols over the Dinj an area.A twin-engined enemy aircraft was probably destroyed in combat with aU.S. Mohawk.Pacific Zone.Solomon Islands.47. During the main landing of enemy forces on Guadalcanal Island onthe 15th, and also on the 16th, Allied aircraft attacked the covering force andtransports; one battleship was damaged, a cruiser torpedoed, and four transportsset on fire.   Eight enemy aircraft were shot down.
A night attack by five Catalinas on Buka Passage Aerodrome resulted in large fires, which probably destroyed fuel dumps and some aircraft on the ground.On the following day, there was no activity at this Aerodrome.Targets in the Buin area were attacked by a total of 29 U.S.Fortresses. A heavy cruiser is believed to have been damaged, a light cruiserwas damaged and left stationary, two other cruisers were probably hit and asmall cargo vessel was set on fire. At least one flying-boat was destroyed and six others damaged.U.S. aircraft made two attacks on enemy installations at RekataBay. Fuel-storage dumps were set on fire and about 20 enemy aircraft on theground were either destroyed or damaged. Two enemy aircraft which wereairborne were shot down.Between the 14th and 17th October, a total of about 70 enemy bombers with fighter escorts made four attacks on U.S. positions and the aerodrome onGuadalcanal. Interception by Allied aircraft resulted in the destruction of 23bombers and six fighters for the loss of two TJ.S. aircraft.Up to the 18th October, 291 enemy aircraft had been destroyed in the solomon Islands area.In attacks on U.S. destroyers by enemy bombers, 12 Japanese aircraft were destroyed for the loss of three U.S. aircraft.Neiv Guinea area.48. U.S. Mitchells, usually operating in threes, bombed the aerodrome atLae and targets in the Salamoa, Mabu and Wairopi Bridge areas. A supplydump near Wairopi Bridge was hit.U.S. Bostons attacked enemy positions near Templeton&apos;s Crossing, - and villages and tracks in the Buna-Kokoda area.Two night attacks on enemy positions on Goodenough Island were made byHudsons.New, Britain area.49. U.S. Fortresses bombed Vunakanau Aerodrome by day, and targets atRabaul by night. At the latter, a large explosion was observed on anunidentified ship.U.S. Mitchells attacked Pilelo Island (74 miles W. of Gasmata); a seaplanewas hit and fires were started in the village.Timor.Hudsons bombed and damaged several large buildings at Ailpu, and also attacked enemy positions in the Dilli area.Three enemy aircraft attacked Same (40 miles S. of Dilli).Admiralty Islands.50. A U.S. Fortress attacked and set on fire a weather-reporting ship inLorengau Harbour.Aleutians.51. The camp area at Kiska was attacked by.U.S. bombers on the 11th,and again on the 14th by bombers with fighter escort. In the second raid, manylarge fires were started and three enemy seaplanes were destroyed on the water.On the 17th, an attack was made on shipping in Kiska Harbour, and also onthe camp area, but cloud prevented observation of results.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.52. Bombs have been dropped on five days and two nights during the week.On the 19th between 0700 and 1300 hours there were incidents at 37 places (13 inSuffolk, 12 in Norfolk, 10 in Essex, one in Cambridgeshire, and one in Lincoln-shire). From present reports more than 70 H.E. were dropped and at 15 of the places there was cannon or machine-gun fire.

Works (Aero engines), as well as somerailway workshops which mount heavy calibre guns, suffered damage.Kassel.The premises of Otto Fennel have been completely destroyed, ^his concernwere makers of binoculars.General.The German Government has suspended all further insurance against war risks in respect of property in the districts of Hamburg and Bremen onaccount of heavy losses already sustained in these areas.A reliable informant reports that recent attacks have made deep impression on the Germans and in certain districts the populace has given way to panic.This is not always confined to those cities actually attacked, for a noticeableexample occurred in Baden-Baden some 20 miles S.of Karlsruhe. The Gauleiter hadto make several personal appeals to the population of Baden-Baden to maintain their calm and confidence. The informant states that confusion after raidsis heightened by a shortage of tiles and the almost entire lack of glass. Theglass shortage is serious and the problem which confronts people living in thebombed towns in winter is a formidable one. It has become impossible now toreplace the thousands of windows broken in bombed towns within forty-eight hours as was possible in the winter of 1941-42, and this will entail serioushardships in the coming winter. The emergency food supplies for the wholeof the Stuttgart district, which were stored in Karlsruhe, were completely destroyed during the raid and this has lead to instructions to all Mayors of thelarger towns in the area to move the Municipal Food Depots and install themoutside their towns as soon as possible. The informant expresses the opinionthat contrary to statements of certain Anglo-Saxon experts, Germans and persons of other nationalities coming from Germany that he has met are convinced thatmass and methodical bombings are likely to bring the war to an end far more quickly than is anticipated.
It is learned that the generous special relief arrangements for raided ares which Reichsmarschall Goring has promised are not so speedy as has been notedheretofore. The first convoy of clothes, underwear and extra rations for thebombed-out population of Karlsruhe only arrived there on the 18th October, thatis, some six weeks after the attack. This is an outstanding example of the recentnoticeable decline in the efficiency of the Relief Organisations of the Reich.Occupied France.M ecmlte.Photographs of small-scale taken on the loth October show that the attack by U.S. Fortresses on the 2nd October on the Avions-Potez Aircraft Factoryresulted in destruction of two areas of camouflage on the main machine shopsnorth of the road, severe damage to the transport garage, experimental shop and both assembly shops. The latter have been stripped of roof lights.
