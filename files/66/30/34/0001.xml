THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT1 *nPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1942. x o **MOST SECRET. Copy No. O ()W.P. (42) 504.November 1, 1942.TO BE  KEPT UNDER LOCK   AND  key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this documentARMY STRENGTHS.Directive by the Minister of Defence.WE have now in Great Britain and Northern Ireland (including canadian and Allied troops) 8 armoured divisions, 14 standard motorised infantry divisions, 1 Royal Marine division and 1 airborne division, total 24 fully mobiledivisions, well equipped with guns and transport, with an average strength ofabout 15,300 men, with 9 corps organisations and corps troops (53,000). Wehave 3 brigade groups with artillery and engineers, which ai&apos;e equivalent toanother fully mobile division. Of the 14 standard infantry divisions 5 have beenreorganised in the past year to include a tank instead of an infantry brigade,thus increasing their striking power. There are also 9 lower establishmentdivisions, averaging about 10.000, organised for semi-mobile defence with reducedscales of artillery and engineers and little transport. In addition, there are3 armoured, 5 tank and 10 infantry brigades not included in divisions and17 un-brigaded battalions; furthermore, 95 home defence and young soldiers&apos;battalions are employed on vulnerable points and airfield defence.2. During 1942 we have sent abroad 1 armoured and 5 infantry divisions which are not included above; also 252,000 men in non-divisional units anddrafts. Under orders for overseas are 2 armoured, 2 infantry and 1 Royal Marinedivisions : total 11 divisions. Of these 5 divisions must be taken from those given in paragraph 1 and will require, their quota of corps, army, anti-aircraft and base units. These additional forces for overseas service could only be found at the expense of troops in the United Kingdom; and it is necessary to take stepsto build up the forces remaining.3. It is proposed to transform the forces remaining in the United Kingdom,after despatch of the 5 divisions mentioned above, into 7 armoured divisions(increase of 1 Canadian armoured division), 18 standard motorised infantry divisions and 1 airborne division, total 26 fully mobile divisions. The 3 brigadegroups will remain as at present. Of the 18 standard divisions 7 will includetank brigades and 6 will be formed from lower establishment divisions brought[24557] b
up in strength. There will be a reserve organisation consisting of 4 divisions and1 officer training brigade, whose main task will be to complete the training of reinforcements for the considerable forces overseas instead of our having, as atpresent, to find these men from the mobile divisions to the continuous detriment of their efficiency.Independent tank and armoured brigades will be reduced to 2 and infantry brigades not in divisions to 5. Battalions for vulnerable points and airfielddefence will be reduced to 24 and the task of guarding aerodromes handed overmainly to the R.A.F. Regiment.The fore&quot;-oin&quot;- will constitute the Home Field Army which ran be reckoned as the equivalent of 33 divisions.4. The object of these changes is to increase the war-power of the Army by concentrating scattered defensive elements into proper formations which can be turned later on into forces for overseas operations. There will be an increase indivisions with an armoured element and additional field, anti-tank and flakartillery will be provided.5. Xo reduction in the force mentioned in paragraph 3 is compatible withour war needs; indeed, it is necessary that rearward services should be provided in 1943 for as many of the divisions as possible with a view to passing to the offensive on the Continent of Europe or elsewhere. To maintain the Army, toprovide for the replacement of casualties as they occur and to build up thenecessary units for offensive action, there will be required an intake to the Armyaveraging 45.000 men per month from Xovember till April 1943, when a further review will be made.6. A.D.G.B. has been reduced to 280.000 men by using women and HomeGuards to the maximum extent possible under present circumstances. 76,000 atleast of the 280.000 will be formed into mobile flak units to accompany any field army divisions used for offensive operations, and further examination is being-made to reduce overheads and make additional savings in the number of fit men employed on anti-aircraft defences in the United Kingdom. The anti-aircraftforce is formed into 7 groups which are the equivalent of 12 divisions.7. The Army of the Xile has lost the services of the Australian corps with  Australian divisions, and the remaining Australian division will be returned toAustralia in 1943. Also the 70th British Division was sent to India to assist in meeting the Japanese threat to Burma and Ceylon. These reductions have beenoffset by the arrival in the Middle East of the 8th British Armoured Division,and 44th and 51st British Infantry Divisions. A separate Command has beenestablished for Persia and Iraq to which the 5th British Division from Indiaand the 56th now at sea have been assigned.8. It is proposed to reorganise the forces in the Middle East to include3 British armoured and 2 South African armoured divisions, 2 British, 1 NewZealand. 2 Indian and the equivalent of 2 Allied divisions of Fighting Frenchand Greek troops; total, 12 divisions.9. The Army in Persia and Iraq will comprise 1 Indian armoured division and 1 British armoured brigade. 2 British. 3 Indian divisions and the Polish
Army of the East of 2 divisions and 2 tank brigades; total, 9 divisions. Grandtotal field divisions in North Africa, Palestine and Syria, Persia and Iraq :26 divisions.10. For the defence of India there will be assembled and ready by next spring 1 Indian armoured division and 2 tank brigades, 2 British divisions and1 brigade group, 10 complete Indian divisions and the equivalent of 2 furtherdivisions in brigade groups, &amp;c. This excludes troops for defence of the North-West Frontier and for Internal Security, which amount to the equivalent of4 divisions and 92 battalions; the whole totalling 20 divisions. There are, inaddition, 2 Chinese divisions which are in process of being formed and equipped.11.   There remain our garrisons abroad, to wit : Gibraltar and Malta the equivalent of 2 divisions.East Africa, including Madagascar that of 3^-.West Africa ancl minor garrisons that of 3-i.Total division equivalent of garrisons, 9.12. We have suffered grievous losses in Malaya, Burma and the Middlei&quot;ast, including the loss of 4 complete divisions at Singapore and 1 South Africandivision in Tobruk. In spite of this, the total strength of British, Dominion and allied forces has been maintained at the equivalent of approximately 100divisions. In maintaining our fighting strength. India has provided the greatestcontribution and has expanded by several divisions, but we have had to findBritish cadres for these divisions.13.   If we estimate our Army in divisions or their equivalent, the generallav-out for 1943 is as follows : United Kingdom   ...      ...      ... ...       ... ... 33Under orders for overseas operations ...       ... ... 5Anti-aircraft divisions    ...       ... ...       ... ... 12Army of the Nile.................. 12Army of Persia and Iraq ...      ... ...      ... ... 9Army of India     ......      ... ...... ... 20Garrisons in Africa and elsewhere ...       ... ... grand total       ...............       100It must be realised that, in setting out the numerical distribution of forcesin equivalent divisions, anti-aircraft and static troops have been included wherethe total numbers of such troops approximately equal a division. these divisions are not provided with artillery, engineers and signals and cannot be counted on as field divisions. The number of field divisions are specifically mentioned in paragraphs 2, 3, 8, 9 and 10.14.   It is our duty to develop, equip and maintain all these units during 1943.W. S. C.November 1, 1942.[24557]
D.O. (41) 18.October 9. 1941:ARMY STRENGTHS.Directive by the Minister of Defence.WE have now in the United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland)26 standard motorised infantry divisions and the Polish division, total 27, wellequipped with guns and transport, with an average strength of about 15,500 men,with 10 Corps organisations and Corps troops (61,000). There are 8 countydivisions for work on the beaches, averaging about 10.000. without artillery otherthan coast artillery and with little transport. We have 5 armoured divisions and 4 Army Tank brigades: the wdiole comprising 14 armoured brigades (with divisional elements); 4 Brigade Groups with artillery and transport; 7 infantry brigades and 12 un-brigaded battalions : furthermore, 8 aerodrome defencebattalions and the 100.000 men in the Hume Defence and Young Soldiers&apos;battalions.2. It is proposed to transform this organisation into 27 standardiseddivisions (hereinafter to be called Field Divisions), plus the Polish Division (whichwill have an armoured element), total 28: and to increase the armoured forces to7 armoured divisions with 8 Army Tank brigades, the whole comprising22 armoured brigades (with 7 divisional elements). The 4 Brigade Groups are toremain. Instead of the 8 county divisions and other units mentioned above,there will be 13 brigades, plus the equivalent of 2 Ally brigades, and 8 &quot; DetachedBattalions&quot;; the foregoing constituting the Home Field Army, which can thus be reckoned the equivalent of 45 divisions. In addition, there will still be the 8 aerodrome battalions and the Home Defence and Young Soldiers&apos; battalions.3. The object of these changes is to increase the war-power of the army,particularly in armoured troops; and to provide additional field, anti-tank andflak artillery, including that required for 5 additional Indian divisions, to be formed during 1942. For this last purpose also it will be necessary to provideup to 17 British battalions for the Indian army.
4. No reduction in the force mentioned in para. 2 is compatible with our war needs. To maintain it during the next nine months. i.e., to July 1, 1942;and also to maintain the drafts for the army of the Middle East, for India and forour garrisons in Iceland, Gibraltar, Malta ancl Hong-Kong. &amp;c, with a normal-wastage of 50,000 a quarter there must be provided an intake to the army of278.000 men. Measures are being taken to provide this. The army also requiresat least 142,000 more women above the 63,000 already recruited.5. In my directive on A.D.G.B. I have proposed that the personnel shouldbe fixed at 280.000 men and that the suggested increase of 50,000 be disallowed :also that the suggested increase of 9,000 in the Coast batteries should bedisallowed. The savings thus provided will be applied towards strengthening theField Army. Finally A.D.G.B. will continually endeavour to develop for theservice of the Home Field Army the largest amount of mobile flak possible, andalso a transferable force available to strengthen the coastal batteries should theEmergency Period of Invasion be instituted. As it is unlikely that the enemycould afford prolonged and widespread bombing of our towns in the advent of invasion, a shuttle arrangement of this kind should be possible, enabling us tomeet according to events either a sustained air attack or Invasion. The Anti-Aircraft force is formed into 12 Divisions.6. The Army of the Nile now consists of the 50th and 70th (formerly 6th)British Divisions, the 1st. 2nd ancl 7th Armoured Divisions with the CavalryArmoured Division (forming) ancl two Army Tank Brigades: the threeAustralian Divisions; one New Zealand; two South African, one Polish andForeign equivalent, ancl the 4th and 5th Indian Divisions, total 16 Divisions.It is intended to reinforce the Middle East with two British Divisions, the 18thand 2nd, from the United Kingdom as convenient.7. Apart from the 2 divisions mentioned above, India has in action in persia and Iraq the 6th, 8th and 10th Indian divisions, ancl General Wavellproposes to send the 17th by the end of the year. During 1942. 4 extra indian divisions and one Indian armoured division will also take the field; total 9.8. For the defence of India, there will remain the equivalent of 3 british divisions and 5 Indian divisions, over ancl above those which will operate outsideIndia.9.   There remain our garrisons abroad, to wit : Iceland (C) the equivalent of 1 division.Gibraltar and Malta that of 2.Singapore that of 3.Aden. Hong Kong ancl other minor garrisons that of 1.Total division-equivalent of garrisons. 7.
10. If we estimate our Army in divisions or their equivalent, the generallayout for 1942 is as follows : United Kingdom    ...      ...... ... ...      ...      45Anti-Aircraft divisions ...      ... ... ...                12Army of the Nile    ...       ...... ... 16Army of India in Iraq and Persia ......... 9Army of India at homeFortress Garrisons ... ...      ... ... ...        7Native African Divisions ... ... ... ...       ...        grand total     ... ......... 9911.   It is our duty to develop, equip and maintain all these units during 1942w. s. c.10 Downing Street. S.W. 1,October 9, 1941.
