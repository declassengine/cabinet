(42) 480.October 22, 1942.Copy No.2JTO BE kept unIt is requested that speciaiensure the secrecy oL-rnitj document.toWAR CABINET.POST-WAR ATLANTIC BASES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Lie, has on several occasions mentioned his view, to which public expression has also been given byNorwegian official spokesmen, that it will be essential after the war for thesecurity of Norway and the peace of Europe that permanent measures shouldadopted for the defence of the Atlantic in which Norway should participatetogether with this country and, it is hoped, the United States. He has statedfurther in strict confidence that, in his view, as part of this scheme it wouldbe necessary to place at our disposal bases in Norway, and desirable that similarbases should be established in Iceland (C) and the Faroes, and possibly alsoin Denmark, Greenland, Ireland and France. The Netherlands Minister forForeign Affairs, Dr. van Kleffens, has also informed me that following on con-versations between his Government and the Governments of Norway andBelgium, the three Governments were considering submitting to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the United States Government joint proposals for bases in theirrespective countries. Mr. Lie intends to take these matters up with the UnitedStates Government in the course of a probable visit to the United States inNovember.2. On his recent visit to the United States the Netherlands Minister forForeign Affairs discussed the matter with Mr. Hull and Mr. Sunnier Welles.He says that he found them favourably disposed and that the proposal is nowbeing examined in detail by the United States experts. When the matter hasbeen raised with me by Mr. Lie and Dr. van Kleffens, I have, of course, not committed myself. But Mr. Lie has now made it plain that he and Dr. vanKleffens consider it of the utmost importance that definite plans should be worked out now. Clearly, therefore, it is desirable that we should reach agree-ment with the United States Government as to the reply to be given to Mr. Lie,when he raises the matter formally on his visit to the United States next month.Dr. van Kleffens raised the matter with me again to-day, and made it plain thathis Government would like to know soon what we thought of the plan.3. The Military Sub-Committee of the Ministerial Committee on Recon-struction Problems have examined the military aspects of this Norwegian-Netherlands-Belgian proposal, but not unnaturally feel unable to express adefinite view upon upon them at the present stage. They recommend, however,that we should take grateful note of the generous offer of post-war bases in norway, Belgium and the Netherlands, but not commit ourselves finally.4. The political arguments in support of encouraging the favourableattitude which the United States Government are reported to be inclined toadopt, are strong.   If my colleagues agree, I propose to instruct Lord Halifax,11880   [24530]
as in the annexed Draft Despatch, to take the matter up with the United StatesGovernment on the political basis. In so doing, we should not be committing ourselves as regards the military aspects of the matter pending further examina-tion. From the political points of view, one of the chief merits of this proposals is that, if adopted by the United States Government, it would represent adefinite undertaking by the United States to bear a share of responsibility forthe maintenance of peace in post-war Europe. ^Foreign Office,October 22, 1942.
ANNEX.Draft Despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington.My Lord, Foreign Office, October    , 1942.IN my despatch No. 634 (N 3906) of the 14th August I informed Sir R.Campbell &quot;that the Norwegian, Netherlands and Belgian Governments had approached His Majesty&apos;s Government unofficially and in strict confidence withthe suggestion that His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Governmentshould have joint naval, military and air bases in their respective territories afterthe war. You will be aware of the early stages of this question from Sir O.Sargenfs letter of the loth May, and it will suffice for me to describe here the subsequent developments.2. There has been one further development in Washington. The Nether-lands Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed me that, during his recent visit to that capital, he spoke to Mr. Cordell Hull and Mr. Sumner Welles of thescheme of Atlantic collaboration, and both of them told him that they were interested&quot; in the idea and that it was being actively studied. Dr. van Kleffenshad only mentioned it in general terms to Mr. Hull and had discussed it in more detail with Mr. Welles, to whom he had presented it not as an isolated idea, butas part of a general scheme of arrangements covering different maritime areas.In Dr. van Kleffens5 s view there should, of course, be other areas similarlytreated, i.e., the Pacific and the Indian Ocean (in which the Netherlands wouldclaim an interest), and even the Mediterranean and the Baltic. Mr. Welles told him that the idea of Atlantic co-operation was being studied, and he hoped thatthe United States Government would be ready to discuss it before the end of theyear.3. I enclose a copy of a despatch from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador toNorwayQ on this subject, from which it will be seen that in the opinion of theNorwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and according to Mr. Lie in that of dr. van Kleffens, it is important to make a start in the preparation of regionalschemes now, without waiting for a general scheme co-ordinating all the regionalarrangements and acceptable to all the Allies. Mr. Lie, possibly accompaniedby Dr. van Kleffens, is planning to visit Washington probably next month and to carry the discussions there a stage further.4. You should also know for your secret information that during my visit to Moscow last December Mr. Stalin said to me that, if France were not revivedas a great Power in the near future, it would, he thought, be in the british interests to have military and naval bases on the French coast, and declared thatthe Soviet Union would be prepared to support His Maiesty&apos;s Government ifthe latter desired to maintain naval and air bases, and also troops if necessary,in Belgium and Holland, and would have no objection to Great Britain havingnaval bases in Norway or Denmark, whilst the Soviet Union would like aguarantee by &quot; certain Powers &quot; as to the entrances to the Baltic Sea. It maybe assumed, therefore, that unless their ideas have changed since last Decemberthe Soviet Government would view the proposals of the Norwegian, Belgian and netherlands Governments benevolently.5. As regards developments in this country, your Lordship will remember that, when Sir O. Sargent wrote to you, the Joint Planning Staff had expressed their views on the Norwegian aspect of the proposal only. The subsequentNetherlands and Belgian offer made it necessary to re-examine the strategicaspect, and I enclose herein copies of correspondence(x) exchanged with the newly-formed Military Sub-Committee to the Ministerial Committee on reconstruction Problems, from which you will see that the MilitarySub-Committee suggest that we should, in principle welcome these offers, butrefrain from committing ourselves to their acceptance, pending further study of the general problem of which they only form a part.6.   We must recognise therefore that the military advisers of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment do not wish to commit themselves at this stage in regard to theurely military aspect of the proposal.     In reality, however, the problem isrst and foremost a political one, for the doubts of the military advisers to(l) Not printed.
His Majesty&apos;s Government were raised upon political considerations, that isto say, whether others besides ourselves will accept the commitments in question or not. It seems to me, therefore, that we may reasonably put the position tothe United States Government quite frankly, telling them that as a politicalproposition these proposals have our support. It would seem, in view of what mr. Hull and Mr. Welles said to Dr. van Kleffens, and to Mr. Law on his recent visit to the United States, that they would be generally sympathetic to proposalsof this kind.7. We should. I consider, say that we are much attracted by the political implications of this idea, which presupposes the abandonment of the conception of neutrality and might be developed into one of the corner-stones of future international policing arrangements, especially if the idea can be adapted foruse in other parts of the world as well. In the broadest sense our aim is topromote joint action to achieve the security and political and economic stability of Europe as a whole, and this Norwegian-Netherlands-Belgian proposal seemsto us a step towards these objects. It is, moreover, difficult to conceive ofpermanent stability in Europe unless the United States take with us some degreeof responsibility for it; and the Norwegians, the Dutch and apparently the belgians have shown quite clearly that thev attach importance to Americanas well as British participation. We ourselves, of course, attach importanceto it. too. and if proposals of this nature were acceptable to American opinionwe would welcome them on that ground alone.8. We should go on to say that from the purely military point of view,and as far as our General Staff here have been able to examine the question,the advantages of the proposal are not so clear. A commitment to maintainbases in foreign countries would seem to involve a commitment for the defenceof those territories as a whole, and the experience of this war suggests thatbases by themselves as strongholds in a hostile or undefended territory are of little value. NeA&apos;ertheless, the existence of bases of this kind would go far,in our view, to provide that element of confidence which has been soconspicuously lacking since the conclusion of the last war. Moreover, evenif we assume that their actual value daring a war would be negligible, theymight still have a great value as one of the buttresses of peace. You couldconclude by saying that we attach so much importance to the political aspectsof the proposal that if the Americans agree with us on the political side wewould be prepared to have the military aspects of the question re-examined.We should, therefore, welcome an expression of the views of the United StatesGovernment on this question, which we understand is already the subject of expert study in the United States.9. Unless you see any objection I shall be grateful if you will speak toMr. Hull or to Mr. Sumner Welles in this sense.
