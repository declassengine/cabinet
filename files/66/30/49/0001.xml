S. A.India Office,November 7, 1942.03Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated November 4, 1942.(19118.)Personal. Parliamentary question for Tuesday, 10th November, asks&quot; whether I will accept the offer of Rajagopalachari to visit this country and will invite him to discuss the present situation in India.&quot;2. Simultaneously I have received letter from Cripps to effect that it wouldbe useful as evidence of continued action by His Majesty&apos;s Government to getRajagopalachari over here and that, though unlikely to produce any definiteresult, it would show our friends here and in America that we are doing our best to try to get a settlement. He adds suggestion that if Rajagopalachari were tocome he should be enabled, without publicity or advertisement, to see congress leaders first, so as to be able to say what are their thoughts on the presentsituation.3. I should be grateful for your suggestions as to replies to both enquiries.It seems clear that no fruitful results can emerge from discussion with representa-tive of one element only unless he can show some indication of agreement byother main elements also. That being so, action taken, despite foreknowledge ofits failure, simply to show well-meaning but ignorant people that- we are notinactive, would seem only to raise expectations that must be falsified. In lightof Jinnah&apos;s uncompromising attitude to Rajagopalachari&apos;s offer and suggestions of the same order from other quarters, I should anticipate that whatever effectinvitation to Rajagopalachari might have here and in America it would onlyexacerbate position in India.[24595]B
Tele a ram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, dated November 5, 1942.(Immediate.)(No. 3170-S.   Personal.)Your personal telegram of 4th November, 19118. Rajagopalachari. entirely agree with your criticisms. Rajagopafachari&apos;s scheme has fallen corn-pletely fiat here, having much more attention outside India than in it. It hasbeen condemned by Jinnah and has had no support from any party. I should in these circumstances be wholly opposed to giving any facilities for the journeyhome (for which he has not, in fact, so far as I can ascertain, asked). It wouldbe an advertisement to Rajagopalachari and Congress, and Cabinet should know (a) that though Congress leaders and Gandhi have for some considerable time now been receiving newspapers, &amp;c, there has not been the veryslightest sign of any change in their attitude or any move to suggestthat they are not in as open opposition and rebellion as in August:(b) while Rajagopalachari has formally broken with the party, I doubtif that breach has had any effect on his close domestic relationor his close political sympathy with Gandhi.2. These considerations apart, it would be out of the question to single out an individual, however important, so closely associated with the work of one party to go home and negotiate or discuss with His Majesty&apos;s Government, orpublicise a particular solution in the United Kingdom. There would be instantoutcry from the other parties, and in my view that outcry would be justified.3. Finally, now that we are committed to post-war discussions here betweenIndians themselves, I am strongly of the opinion that India, and not the UnitedKingdom, should be the venue for political exploration in the meantime. It willconfuse issues and raise hopes destined to be disappointed if we lead people tothink that by going home they can take advantage of the inevitably less closefamiliarity of His Majesty&apos;s Government with the position in this country and get solutions accepted that would have no hope of success out here. And any facilities for Rajagopalachari or anyone else associated with Congress atthis stage would be taken as a sign of surrender by Moslems, Princes, depressed classes and our other supporters.4. Invitation would again be likely, as you suggest, to raise the difficult question of allowing Rajagopalachari to visit Gandhi or other Congress leaders.To that I would be entirely opposed, and I am sure Cabinet will realise the forceof my reasons, which  I will, if necessary, develop. Publicity or advertisementcould not be avoided, nor could we refuse facilities to other prominent politiciansif we gave them to Rajagopalachari.5.   I suggest following answer : (a) &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government welcome the endeavours of Mr. Raja-gopalachari and others to clear the ground for a settlement of theIndian problem. But Mr. Rajagopalachari,/however well meaning, isnot a party leader, and does not represent or carry any mandate fromany important party or interest. His scheme has* attracted littleattention in India, and that attention predominantly critical. Inparticular, Mr. Jinnah has made it clear that the Moslems are notprepared to consider it. Nor can His Majesty&apos;s Government dis-criminate in this matter by giving special facilities to a singleindividual or representative of a single party.&quot;(&amp;). Supplementaries. Question: Has Mr. Rajagopalachari asked for facilities.   Answer : No, sir.(I am asking Hope to confirm that he has made no request inMadras, and will telegraph further. I have little doubt myself that what he is waiting for is an invitation by his Majesty&apos;s Government orby me, with increase in stature which that would inevitably involve.)
Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, dated November 7, 1942.(Immediate.)(No. 3182-S.   Personal.)Following private and personal telegram from Hope is repeated for informa-tion. Hope has separately confirmed that Rajagopalachari has not made any application for passport facilities : No. 9 (? 0) 18/M, dated 6th November.   Private and personal.Your telegram 3168 S of 5th November. I gave Rajagopalachari an interview yesterday at his request and shall be reporting to you separately onthis. Actually, the conversation was inconclusive and of no great import orsignificance.As regards his visiting England, he said he did not want to undertake the trouble and anxiety of journey unless he saw some chance of it beingfruitful, and for this to be the case he felt some sign of a &quot; change of heart onthe part of British Government &quot; to be necessary.I did not specifically ask him if he had applied for a passport, but ampractically certain he has not. However, I will check up and telegraph toyou again, repeating to Secretary of State.APPENDIX A.Mr. Rajagopalachari&apos;s Plan.(Reuter Mesi age from New Delhi dated October 21, 1942.)4 iMr. RAJAGOPALACHARI, former Madras Premier, who resigned fromthe Congress Working Committee, told press men here to-day : &quot; If I can get aplane and a passport, neither disinclination nor work will stand in the way ofmy going to England.&quot; &quot; I feel,&quot; he added, &quot; that the British people have beenmisled in connection with the Indian problem and that I can make them see the truth.&apos;&apos;Mr. Rajagopalachari stressed the importance of a national government forIndia and the guarantee of Burma&apos;s future status before any offensive was undertaken.Nothing is known in London. Reuter adds, of any suggestion thatMr. Rajagopalachari should visit this country.Referring to statements that no specific proposals for a settlement of theIndian question had so far been advanced, Mr. Rajagopalachari outlined ascheme for a provisional government, which he claimed would&quot; necessitate theminimum of parliamentary enactments, and which, speaking with knowledgederived from his recent talks and also of the issues involved, he was convincedthat both Congress and the Muslim League would accept. He suggested that theViceroy should act as the Crown would in a crisis in England. The viceroy should select those who were the most popular and most responsible and ask themto run the Government. The Viceroy could visualise what kind of legislaturewould come into being if elections were held, and he could, if he liked, select men for the Government who could face a proper Legislature. Such a governmentshould be formed straightaway. Then arrangements should be made to holdelections, direct to the Provinces, and indirect to the Centre from the provincial legislatures.Mr. Rajagopalachari added : &quot; 1 press so much for elections because unfairuse has been made of the position by British propagandists who want to tell theworld that we desire to have a national government responsible to nobody. We-don&apos;t desire any such thing. We want the national government of which I amspeaking to be responsible to this Legislature. I am suggesting that it should bebrought into existence immediately.&quot; There was nothing, he added, to preventthe Government selecting five important Congressmen whom the Viceroy feltwould top the list in elections anywhere at any time, and would command the respect and loyalty of the people throughout the country. Mr. Rajagopalacharisaid it would include people in prison, adding : &quot; Let there be no mistake about that.&quot; He suggested that the Viceroy should ask Mr. Jinnah to join this Govern -ment with as many men of his choice as the Moslem League Leader liked. Thepurpose of this was to meet Mr. Jinnah&apos;s fear that the issues might be prejudicedT24595] - B 2
by the formation of such a government. That was in accordance withMr. Gandhi&apos;s express offer that he was prepared to have the entire governmentgiven to Mr. Jinnah on the real transfer of power from the British, saidMr. Rajagopalachari. These men from Congress and the League should thenadd to themselves three persons, representing roughly any important factors leftout or anyone the Government might feel was sufficiently important and might beaccepted as a cementing factor for the time being.Mr. Rajagopalachari added that this Government would be an ideal one to face the Legislature and serve the country at the present juncture. &quot; I don&apos;tthink,&quot; he said, &quot; that Congress or the Moslem League can refuse the offerwithout losing their leadership. If this Government faces the new Legislatureit wnll get the confidence of that Legislature, but if it does not, the Viceroy, acting )in the position of the Crown, will know what to do dissolve one or the other.&quot;Mr. Rajagopalachari made it clear that the transfer of power which hevisualised would include protection for the Commander-in-Chief and war strategyas agreed on more or less definitely at the time of the Cripps talks. declaring that any &quot; reasonable &quot; Viceroy should agree to his scheme and press it on theGovernment, Mr. Rajagopalachari said he was convinced that the BritishGovernment would not take upon themselves the responsibility of standing inthe way.   The Viceroy must take the initiative.After stating that he was prepared to go to Britain, Mr. Rajagopalachariwas asked, what about America ?&quot; I don&apos;t want pinpricks on England,&quot; said Mr. Rajagopalachari. &quot; I want to go direct to Britain. If America in her own interest feels that she should tellBritain what she should do, Amerioa may do so. If there is American pressureit should be spontaneous not indirect pressure from India. I feel the british people have been misled in this matter. I feel I could make them see the truth.&quot; Commenting on the Duke of Devonshire&apos;s references to &quot;prelates,&quot;Mr. Rajagopalachari remarked: &quot;I think that prelates are as good as the landlords in this matter. When there is a great quarrel between a great people and a great government, it is good even for prelates to intervene. I think theLondon Times right and the Duke of Devonshire wrong when it says it is dangerous to start an offensive with a hostile nation behind.&quot; The story that popular government in India would be unpopular with thepresent Armed Forces is entirely false.&quot; Mr. Rajagopalachari said he was prepared to take a vote of the present soldiers on whether they want a national government for India or not and abide by their verdict. They would die morecheerful if they had a national government.Declaring that India is not in any sense a domestic concern of the BritishEmpire, Mr. Rajagopalachari asserted : &quot;If the British Government had notstated clearly, as they have done, that post-war India shall be independent, itcould be claimed that it was a domestic concern, but seeing at the end of the warour independence has been declared and assured, the position of India during thewar period is a war matter and not an imperialist one. The Allied Nations,&quot; hesaid. &quot; should all sit together and consider what is the best thing to do with thepresent Indian Government for the war period. Incidentally, it is no use theUnited Nations coming to India to take evidence, because if their object were only to gain time and feed us on hopes, it would be a good plan, but if their object is to do something now, I would advise the United Nations Mission tosettle down in London and discuss it with the British Government who are obviously in possession of all the facts, and if necessary send for the importantmen from India. After all, it is not a permanent settlement, but only for timeof war and for the purposes of war. That would bring about speedy results; theparty to be convinced most is the British Government, and action is to be takenby the-British Government.&quot;APPENDIX B.Note, on Mr. RajagopalacharVs Plan.Mr. RAJAGOPALACFIARrS object is to put forward a scneme which,purports to remove the difficulties stated by His Majesty&apos;s Government to standin the way cf a political advance.   The ex-Premier of Madras is an experiencedadministrator, but his present proposals are of the nature of a political manifestoand lack the precision of a specific and workable scheme.
He proposes the complete transfer of power to a provisional indian government (it is to be presumed that his proposals include the exercise by theprovisional government of all the powers now exercisable by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment through the Viceroy and Governors in the Indian Provinces), withthe important reservation that control of military policy and operations would remain with the War Cabinet in London and the Commander-in-Chief in India.But the implications of this reservation, if it is to be satisfactory to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, are not discussed. The Commander-in-Chief, in directing and carrying out military policy, requires the full co-operation and support of thecivil power in all manner of ways finance, supply, transport, recruiting, themaintenance of law and order, to mention some of them and this would necessitate maintenance in the hands of the Viceroy of an overriding authorityenabling him to control and intervene at need as now in almost every branch ofthe civil administration. But Mr. Rajagopalachari would no doubt deny thatthe Viceroy, as the servant of His Majesty&apos;s Government, needs for war purposesor should have such power. The point was crucial in the breakdown of the Crippsnegotiations. Mr. Eajagopalachari says that the transfer of power should besubject to the reservations regarding the Commander-in-Chief and Defenceroughly agreed at the time of the Cripps conversations. The extent of Congressagreement is stated on page 10 of the White Paper. Where they disagreed isstated in the latter part of the Congress resolution issued on the 11th April(White Paper, page 18) &quot; It has been made clear that the defence of india will in any event remain under British control .... to take away Defencefrom the sphere of responsibility at this stage is to reduce that responsibility toa farce and nullity.&quot; Presumably Mr. Rajagopalachari would not be satisfied with a transfer of power less than what Congress demanded in April. Theproblem remains, how are the Commander-in-Chief and the War Cabinet, from whom he must continue to receive his orders, to be assured of the support of an autonomous Government to the extent essential to the execution of his functions ?The proposals now put forward purport to answer the questions that havebeen asked by Government Speakers here -to whom- is power to be transferred?and to whom is the new executive authority to be responsible&apos;?The new executive authority is to consist (a) of five Congress leaders selected by the Viceroy as persons who he feels &quot; would top the list in elections anywhereat any time&quot; (and who would include persons now under detention); (b) ofMr. Jinnah and as many of his Moslem League colleagues as he would wish tobring in; and (c) of three persons selected either by (a) and (b) or by the viceroy to represent other important factors or as persons of importance who &apos;&apos; mightbe accepted as a cementing factor for the time being.&quot; In defence of (b) reference is made to Gandhi&apos;s paradoxical statement that he is prepared to have thewhole government entrusted to Mr. Jinnah if there were a real transfer of power by Great Britain. (Those who will may believe him !) Neither Congress nor the moslem League could refuse the offer, it is said, without losing their leadership.This composite body must surely have a leader, but the proposals contain no reference to him, to the manner in which he is to be chosen (presumably the onusof selection is to fall on the Viceroy), or as to his functions and powers.This new executive is to be responsible to the Indian Legislature, not to thepresent body, but to one newly constituted (after, not before, the provisionalgovernment takes charge). It is proposed that there should be fresh elections ofthe Provincial Legislatures and that the persons so elected should in turn electthe Central Legislature. Nothing is said as to the constitution and size of thelatter, but we may perhaps suppose that Mr. Rajagopalachari has in mind theindirectly-elected Federal Legislature contemplated under the 1935 Act insofar as it is representative of British India (for his proposals leave no room for the representation of the States in the provisional Government).The first hurdle here is the holding of Provincial elections, which it wasdecided to postpone owing to the internal excitement and interference with thewar effort which they would cause. Mr. Rajagopalachari meets those objectionsby the argument that it is a heavier task to suppress disturbances than to holdelections. Even if the choice were as simple as that, the argument is notnecessarily convincing; an electoral campaign covering the whole of British India,with such momentous issues at stake, might weli engender enough excitement(extending possibly to the Indian Army, by whose political views Mr. Rajago-palachari says he would be content to abide) to paralyse temporarily the countiVspreparedness for defence against an invader. Assuming, however, that thishurdle could be got over, or avoided by making use of the existing provincial legislatures, what would be the make-up of a Central Legislature elected by thex rovincial members?  How would the two principal parties stand?
The 1935 Act provides that the Federal A ssernbly shall consist of 250 members from British India (and half as many, in addition, from the Indian States). The250 seats are divided as follows: General, 105; Moslem, 82; Commerce, 11;Labour, 10; others (European, Sikh, Christian, &amp;c), 42. It seem unlikely thatat the most more than 90 Moslems would occupy seats, and it would be unwise to suppose that all of these would support the Moslem League, though undoubtedly a far higher proportion would do so now than would have done, say, in 1937.As regards Congress, we could hardly assume that they would capture fewerseats in the Provincial Legislatures than they did in 1937. Taking the 1937returns, and assuming that the proportion of Congress seats in the provincial legislatures would be reflected in the Central Assembly, calculation suggests that116 of the 250 members would belong to the Congress Party. They would undoubtedly be the strongest single party, and although not having an absolutemajority would probably enjoy the support of enough other members to dominatethe position.It would be rash to suppose that an Assembly so constituted would for longsupport a ministry in Avhich the Moslem League held half or more of the seats. Itwill be open to the Viceroy, says Mr. Rajagopalachari, to dismiss the ministry ordissolve the Legislature. That would almost certainly mean that the moslem league would &quot;walk out,&quot; cease to co-operate and possibly attempt by force to set up Pakistan. In any case, what would the Viceroy do (and this in themiddle of a war) ? Set up a predominantly Congress Ministry to ensure to Congresspredominance in the Legislature; or hold fresh elections with the certainty ofthe same results; or return (if that were conceivably possible) to the presentsystem of government ?Mr. Rajagopalachari&apos;s scheme is really only another device for securing to congress, or at any rate to the Hindu elements, the immediate control of India.It has been far too transparent to take in Mr. Jinnah, who has roundly condemnedit. It has in fact found no support from any party, and such attention as it hasreceived in India has been predominantly critical. * It is impossible, therefore, to regard the scheme as it stands as a promising basis for a solution of the politicaldeadlock, or as justifying an invitation to Mr. Rajagopalachari to visit thiscountry.
