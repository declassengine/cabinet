NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. In the Eastern Mediterranean our light craft and destroyers have been active in support of the Eighth Army&apos;s advance.Our destroyers and light craft have inflicted damage on enemy ships in threeengagements in the Channel.Three convoys in the North Atlantic and one in the Caribbean have been attacked by U-boats.   Shipping losses have been severe.A German U-boat has been sunk.Northern Waters and Baltic.2. The Norwegian submarine Uredd, while on patrol off the north-west coast of Norway on the 18th, torpedoed a 3,000-ton ship which went ashore offAraldan Island.A Russian submarine sank the Finnish s.s. Agnes (2,983 tons) off Gdyniaon the 1st November.Black Sea.3. The enemy attempted a landing from about 30 R-boats E.S.E. ofXovorossisk, on the 30th, but were driven off. On the same day Russian lightcraft carried out a raid on Anapa, where they inflicted casualties and took offsome personnel.Home Waters and North Atlantic.4. On the night 29th/30th, north of Cherbourg, four of our light craftengaged enemy forces, which opened fire on one another. A trawler and an R-boatwere left out of action after being heavily hit by M.G.B.S. Our craft came underthe fire of shore batteries, but had no casualties, although M.G.B. 317 andM.T.B. 50 were slightly damaged.On the night 31st/Tst, H.M. Destroyer Brocklesby fought a running engage-ment in fog with an enemy convoy of three ships, escorted by two destroyers anda trawler, which had been reported and shadowed by aircraft off the coast ofBrittany. One ship was seen to be on fire. Brocklesby received minor damagebut had no casualties.On the following night, H.M. Destroyer Tynedale and the Polish DestroyerKrakowiak. with four M.T.B.s, intercepted two escorted 2,000-ton ships, boundto the eastward, south of Guernsey. One ship was set on fire and a ship and atrawler were probably torpedoed. Our destroyers were slightly damaged andthere were two casualties in Krakowiak.5. A Focke-Wulf 200 was shot down west of Cape Finisterre by thes.s. Omega on the 31st. Three days later another Focke-Wulf was shot downwest of ITshant by a Hurricane catapulted from the s.s. Empire Heath in ahomeward-bound convoy.Mediterranean.6. A feint landing at Ras el Kanais was made by destroyers and light crafton the night of the 28th/29th. Enemy shore batteries were engaged by M.T.B.S,but our forces sustained no damage or casualties. Similar operations were carriedout by M.T.B.S on the night of the lst/2nd at Ras Gibeisa and El Daba. Rafts,calcium flares and balloons were dropped and drew the enemy&apos;s fire.7. Naval aircraft have attacked enemy shipping and, in conjunction withthe R.A.F., have carried out bombing and machine-gun attacks on land targetson the Egyptian front.8. A reinforcement of Spitfires for Malta were flown off from H.M. Aircraft-carrier Furious and arrived at Malta on the 29th.Two minesweeping groups manned by the Greek Navy have now joined theMediterranean Fleet.9. It is estimated that, during the week, some 15,000 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or seriously damaged by our aircraft.
10. On the 31st the Vichy French Submarines Oreade ancl La Psyche passed gibraltar westbound.During the week 18,027 tons of French merchant shipping also passed gibraltar westbound.Pacific.11. It was announced from Washington on the 3rd that U.S. submarines in Far Eastern waters have recently sunk two large tankers and five othermerchant ships, ancl damaged one converted aircraft-carrier, a destroyer and a medium-sized tanker.12. The U.S. aircraft-carrier, which was reported in last week&apos;s Residueto have been seriously damaged, was sunk in a second attack by aircraft on the26th October.Allied bombers attacked Japanese warships in the Solomons area on the30th and 31st.   Details are given in the &quot;Air Situation.&quot;13. A Japanese destroyer, which was believed to have been carryingreinforcements to Guadalcanal Island, was torpedoed on the night 29th/30th by .S. M.T.B.s.Anti-Submarine Operations.14. A German U-boat was sunk off Port Said on the 30th after continuedattacks by aircraft and destroyers. The Captain, four officers ancl 35 ratingswere taken prisoner.A Catalina probably damaged a U-boat on the 1st, south of Iceland (C).Twenty-one other attacks have been reported; seven by surface craft and14 by aircraft. Of these, seven were carried out off the coasts of newfoundland and Nova Scotia, one north of Iceland (C), and two in the Mediterranean. Inthe Indian Ocean, an attack was made by a Catalina off the Maldive Islands.Enemy Intelligence.German.15. The Scheer was sighted by air reconnaissance on the 31st in Lofiord,Trondheim. It is possible that the Hipper has moved to Altenfiord, on the North coast of Norway.Italian.16. There has been considerable decrease in the traffic from Italy to Libyaduring the week.A daily air reconnaissance of Gibraltar is now carried out by the enemy.Japanese.17. Two heavy cruisers, several light cruisers, 16 or 18 destroyers, three possible seaplane-tenders, a tanker and 12 merchant ships were sighted in theBuin/Faisi area on the 29th October.U-boats.18. There are possibly 120 German U-boats at sea. It is considered thatthe rate of new production from the yards is now between 20 and 25 a month.Activity in the area between Gibraltar and the Azores has increased.Several U-boats are believed to have been moved across the Atlantic from theWest Indies.In the South Atlantic, two are still off Capetown ancl four others may be tothe eastward.Protection of Seaborne Trade.19. During the week ending the 1st/2nd November, 846 ships have beenconvoyed. Of these, 155 were in ocean convoys and 691 in British coastal convoys. Two armed merchant cruisers, one anti-aircraft ship, 65 destroyers(including two United States destroyers) and 80 sloops, cutters and corvettes(including three United States cutters) have been employed on escort duties.During the week, 49 ships in one ocean convoy arrived in home waters.[24589n b
Enemy Attack on Shipping.20. During the week 39 ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boats,of which ten are known to have sunk.Eight, including the s.s. President Dourner (11.998 tons) with service personnel from the Cape, were torpedoed in further attacks on a homeward-bound convoy from Freetown, and two more were torpedoed in the homeward-bound convoy which was heavily attacked in mid-Atlantic last week. During the latter part of the current week, 15 ships were torpedoed in another homeward-bound convoy from Canada, which was repeatedly attacked to the east of Belle Isle.Two were sunk in Wabana Anchorage. Newfoundland.In the South Atlantic two were torpedoed east of Durban, two south ofCapetown, one 900 miles south of St. Helena, one in the Gulf of Guinea, and onesouth of St. Paul Rocks. Four ships in a United States convoy were torpedoed inthe Caribbean.The s.s. A bosso (11,330 tons) homeward bound from the Cape with service personnel, was sunk in the South-West Approaches.Five ships proceeding independently to North Russia were attacked by -boats and aircraft.One ship was mined and sunk off Trinidad.The United States s.s. President Coolidge (21,936 tons) was mined and sunkin the entrance to Espiritu Santo harbour. New Hebrides, on the 25th.British Minelaying.21. During the week mines were laid by surface craft between Scotlandand the Faeroes.Aircraft laid mines of! the Frisian Islands, in the Bay of Biscay and in the mouth of the Seine.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.22. Minelaying by E-boats off the East Coast was suspected on one night of the week.  Aircraft may also have laid mines on one night.Fourteen mines have been destroyed during the week; twelve of them inthe Lyme Bay area. The mine totals now7 are : acoustic 1,329; magnetic 2,718;moored 1,769.A total of 100 mines has been sw^ept in the approaches to Malta by one motorlaunch flotilla up to the 29th October.Enemy Merchant Shipping.23. It is reported that regular sailings have begun of oil barges towed bytugs between Roumanian and Crimean ports.The Italian tanker Albara (2,104 tons) arrived at Istanbul, fully loaded,from Constanza on the 1st November. On the same day the Hungarian Szeged(595 tons) sailed from Istanbul for Burgas. It appears likely that a regularshipping service is to be established between Budapest and Istanbul.vichy French Intelligence.24. The following are estimated to be the dispositions at Toulon and north African ports of the French warships which are believed to be fully effective :-Toulon. One battle cruiser, the Strasbourg; two 8-inch cruisers, two 6-inch cruisers, 13 large destroyers, seven destroyers, four submarines.Dakar. One battleship, the Richelieu; &apos; three 6-inch cruisers, one armed merchant cruiser, two large destroyers, seven submarines.Casablanca.

Two submarines.
MILITARY SITUATION.Egypt.25. During the 29th further enemy concentrations in the northern sectorwere dispersed by our artillery fire. That night the enemy launched two attacks against the flanks of the wedge, which we had gained the previous night, butboth were driven off. In the southern sector our patrols were very active, and afeint attack against Hemeimat failed to provoke any enemy reaction.26. The following night an attack was launched in the northern sectorby the Australian division. This attack was successful, and isolated severalenemy positions.   Elsewhere on the front there was only very slight activity.27. Throughout the afternoon of the 31st a counter-attack against theAustralian division appeared imminent, but by dusk it had not materialised.During the evening, however, some enemy tanks succeeded in joining the enemyisolated positions remaining behind our forward troops in the northern sector.28. During the night of the 1st/2nd November one of our infantry divisions,supported by tanks, attacked in the northern sector to clear a gap in the enemydefences, through which our armoured forces could be passed four miles west of Tel El Eisa. In spite of strong enemy resistance and counter-attack, by the morning of the 2nd our forces had penetrated nearly three miles into the enemyline on a front of 4.000 yards. The northern face of the corridor thus achievedwas secured to a distance of 6 miles west of Tel El Eisa, and strong enemypressure during the day was resisted. During the afternoon the enemy launcheda counter-attack from the south-west, and later in the day we attacked west and north-west from the corridor. To the north-west our infantry was held up bystrong enemy positions on a track leading S.S.W. from Sidi Abd El Rahmanand the attack was recalled. To the west we captured Tel El Aqqaqir (6i- miles.S.W. of Rahman) and held it. At dawn on the 3rd an armoured formationadvanced south-west from the corridor, but their advance was delayed by mines and anti-tank guns.29. During the night of the 1st/2nd the enemy also attacked against ourextreme right flank. Enemy units which had been cut off when our line \vasextended to reach the coast made a determined effort to co-operate with enemy attacks from the west. Our positions, however, remained unchanged. Enemymovement was observed to the west of our position throughout the 2nd, and during the night of the .2nd/3rd there were signs that the enemy to. the east of this position might attempt to break out. No movement had, however, beenreported up to mid-day of the 3rd. To support our main attack on the night of the 1st/2nd, diversionary attacks were made by our forces to the south inthe area W.S.W. of Tel El Makh Khad and astride the Ruweisat Ridgefeature. These diversions appear to have deceived the enemy. Explosions wereheard behind their lines in the southern sector and some slight withdrawalsof enemy infantry were observed, and our line was then advanced.30. Some of our light mobile forces were passed through the corridor early on the 2nd and, operating from the south of El Daba, &quot;destroyed 53 enemyM.T. during the day. By the morning of the 3rd they had located a concentration of enemy aircraft on a landing ground 15 miles W.&quot;S.W. of Daba, and a R.A.F.raid on it was arranged.31. During the 3rd there were signs that the enemy was continuing tothin out in the forward areas. By the afternoon our aircraft found good targetson the main road as the enemy withdrawal in the northern sector began.In the southern sector our reconnaissance units maintained touch with theenemy forward elements who were withdrawing. By last light our forwardpatrols had advanced on an average some 4 miles.32. During the night of the 3rd/4th the isolated enemy pockets behindour forward troops in the coastal area were cleared up;After preliminary attacks by our leading infantry on enemy positions sputhof the gap, our forces passed through. Infantry arid armoured troops movedfirst south-west and then turned north-west towards El Daba. By the afternoon of the 4th our leading elements were established on the escarpment4 miles south of El Daba. Our light mobile forces had meanwhile advancedstill further westwards.[24589J B 2
These leading elements were followed through the gap by some of ourarmoured forces, which moved in the direction of El Daba. By the morning ofthe 4th these armoured troops had reached a line running approximately South from Ghazal, and by afternoon they had encountered the remnants of the15th and 21st Panzer and 90th Light Divisions and an engagement was inprogress.Our advance in the southern sector continued during the night of the 3rd/4thand the following day. By mid-day progress of some 8 miles had beenreported from all formations in this sector.33. During the night of the 4th/5th our armoured and infantry forcesadvanced rapidly, and by first light had reached the railway west of El Dabastation and were within 10 miles of Fuka.34. In the course of our advance General von Stumme (said to have beenin command during RommeFs absence in Germany) is known to have been killed. We have so&quot; far captured over 9,000 prisoners, including General Rittervon Thoma, Commander of the German Afrika Corps, and a number of othersenior German and Italian officers, and destroyed more than 260 German andItalian tanks and captured or destroyed at least 270 guns.The Russo-German Campaign.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)Northern and Central Sectors.35. South-east of Lake Umen the Germans have gained ground in an attack which appears to have been of local significance only.Stalingrad Sector.36. Attacking apparently with small forces, the Germans continue to advance slowly in the northern -factory area of Stalingrad. The Russians, fortheir part, have been delivering strong relieving attacks in the area 5 to 10 miles south of Stalingrad.Caucasus Sector.37. West of the Upper Terek River, the Germans, in a sharp pushsouthwards, have taken Nalchik and, they claim, Alagir. The latter town liesat the northern end of the Ossetian military highway,- one of the two channels of supply to the Russian forces in this area which can be kept open during thewinter, the other being the Georgian Pass. The Germans are still some 35 milesfrom the Georgian Pass itself. In the Western Caucasus continued Germanefforts to approach Tuapse are meeting with strong Russian resistance.Summary.38. For the past two months, the German rate of advance in South Russiahas been extremely slow.Since the 3rd September, the Germans have given ground in the area ofYelansk, on the River Don, but have approached and entered Stalingrad. InCaucasia German detachments, pushing - eastwards across the steppe, had approached the Volga and the railway Astrakhan-Kizlyar by early September.Communications in this area are, however, difficult; at this season they areaggravated by mud and rain. It is believed, therefore, that the Germans havenow relaxed any firm hold on the region eastwards of the line Obilnoe-Valizhavoa;and the detachments have probably been withdrawn. Between the Rivers Kumaand Terek the Germans have fanned out, while from the Mozdok area they sought,in the first half of September, to strike southwards and south-eastwards in thedirection of Grozni. Thwarted in that effort, they advanced up the eastern bankof the Upper Terek. When that advance in its turn had been halted, they brokethrough west of the Upper Terek and are now in the neighbourhood of Alagir,if tljey are not actually in possession of that town. In the mountains themselveswinter conditions have set in, without the Germans having been able to effectany crossing in force. It may be accepted, therefore, that detachments whichadvanced up to and through the passes have either had to retreat or have beenannihilated. In the western Caucasus the Germans, since the 3rd September,have approached to within 15 to 20 miles of Tuapse from the north-east and havetaken Noyorissisk.
39. In the Terek sector German efforts, though they have varied theirdirection, have been persistent. The latest thrust towards Alagir would appearto have had as its main purpose the cutting, off of Russian forces west of theUpper Terek and thus the clearing of the German southern flank. At this lateseason, at any rate, an attempted advance southward over the Georgian andOssetian Passes seems highly unlikely.40. For the greater part of the two months under review the Germansdirected their main effort against Stalingrad. The city, however, has now lostits strategic importance the route of the Volga will automatically be closed bywinter; and the capture of Stalingrad would have little more than prestige value.Largely&apos;for that reason, no doubt, the Germans appear latterly to have beenemploying reduced forces against the town.Madagascar.41. By the evening of the 27th October our forward troops had reached a point six miles north of Alakamisy (15 miles north of Fianarantsoa). Alakamisywas occupied early on the morning of the 29th and late that afternoon our troopsentered Fianarantsoa. Opposition was slight and our troops received a somewhatindifferent welcome. By the evening of the 29th the road had been cleared for a distance of six miles south of Fianarantsoa. In this advance we captured355 natives and 85 Europeans, including the last two battalion commanders onthe island.   Our own casualties were light.Obstructions and road blocks continued to delay our advance southwards fromFianarantsoa. One company of our troops has arrived at Manakra (on the east coast S.E. of Fianarantsoa) by rail.  The situation there is quiet.India and Burma.42. In the Akyab coastal area there have been some minor patrol skirmishesa few miles south of the Bengal frontier.South-West Pacific Area.43. In the New Guinea area the Australian forces have occupied Kokodaand are in contact with the Japanese at Oivi (three miles east of Kokoda).South Pacific Area.Solomons.44. The U.S. forces on Guadalcanal island consist of three equivalentbrigade groups, with a total strength of 20,000. They &apos; have success-fully repulsed the recent Japanese attacks and are reported to be improving their positions to the westward. An additional Japanese landing on Guadal-canal has been reported to the east of the U.S. position. ,A landing in force has been made by the Japanese on the north^ coast ofMalaita Island. The Japanese are not yet in contact with the small U.S. forcein the north-western part of the island.AIR SITUATION.General Review.45. Owing to bad weather, Bomber Command did not operate by nightagainst land targets.In Egypt, our aircraft co-operated fully and effectively with our land forces.Successful attacks were made on enemy shipping in the Mediterranean, andin the Solomons area.United Kingdom.46.   Fighter Command flew 853 defensive sorties by day and 203 by night.Enemy activity against this country was again on a small scale.  Seventy-fiveenemy aircraft flew overland by day and 35 by night.At dusk on the 31st, 60 enemy fighters and fighter-bombers composed&apos; ofF.W. 190s and Me. 109s crossed the Kent Coast, and while half of them delivered
a sharp bombing and machine-gun attack on Canterbury, the remainder, acting as rear cover, operated nearer the coast, where they indulged in indiscriminateand scattered bombing. This attack was followed up on the same night by twowaves of Do. 217s. The first, composed of about 15 aircraft, dropped bombs overa wide area in Kent and Essex. The second wave of nearly 20 aircraft againattacked the Canterbury area. Fourteen enemy aircraft were destroyed and six were damaged.   We lost two Spitfires.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.47. Fighter, Bomber and Army Co-operation Commands despatched 280,65 ancl 6 offensive sorties respectively, which compare with 388, 77 and 20 lastweek.Targets in Germany were attacked by small forces of Wellingtons andStirlings. Bombs were dropped on Emden. Wesel and at Lingen, where therailway workshops are believed to have been hit.Mosquitos bombed the airfields at Langeoog. Wangerooge and Leeuwarclen,and the docks at Den Helder. Lockheed Venturas, operating for the first time from this country, bombed and hit the railway track near Amersfoort and destroyed a canal bridge near Utrecht.In Northern France, power stations near Mazingarbe, Beuvry, Lille, andtwo in the Point-a-Vendin area were attacked by Bostons and in each case hitson the target are reported. Other Bostons attacked and hit factories near Bruayand Roulers. and, with fighter escort, bombed Longuenesse airfield.Spitfires and Army Co-operation Mustangs, on harassing operations over the coastal districts of Belgium. Holland and France, attacked hangars on Berckairfield, three factories, an armed trawler, a 1.000-ton vessel ancl a number ofgoods trains, locomotives and gun-posts. Whirlwind bombers hit a railway linenear Cherbourg and a hutted camp at Etaples.Owing to the prevalence of low cloud, only four fighter sweeps could be attempted, and only one of these encountered any enemy opposition. Four enemy fighters wrere destroyed, one was probably destroyed and five were damaged.From all the above operations, seven bombers, three Whirlwinds and fiveSpitfires are missing; one pilot was rescued. Two aircraft crashed in thiscountry.Night.48. Owing to adverse weather conditions. Bomber Command was unableto operate against land targets.A total of 19 Whitleys of Army Co-operation Command dropped leafletson three occasions over French towns.Coastal Operations.49. Coastal Command despatched 465 sorties, of which 205 were on anti-U-boat operations and 78 on convoy escorts. In addition, Bomber Commanddespatched 50 aircraft on patrols west of the Bay of Biscay, and 14 Halifaxeson escort duties. Aircraft of Fighter Command flew 384 sorties, including sixby U.S. aircraft, and a further 35 offensive sorties against enemy shipping.Very little shipping was sighted and the only attacks reported were by aWellington on three mine-sweepers off Lorient, and by a Spitfire which &quot; shot up &quot;a 3,000-ton tanker off Havre.Interceptions off our coast resulted in the destruction by Beaufighters of threeJu. 88s. .On anti-shipping and anti-U-boat patrols, five aircraft were lost (two crewsrescued) and four aircraft, including one U.S. Liberator, crashed.Fifty-five aircraft, including four naval Swordfish, laid 91 sea mines. Twoof these aircraft are missing.Mediterranean.Egypt and Libya.50. Allied aircraft, which flew 6,146 sorties, compared with 4,842 lastweek, carried out continuous night and day attacks on enemy landing grounds,M.T., camps and other objectives.A large number of enemy aircraft was destroyed or damaged on theground.   In an attack by fighters on the landing ground at Maaten Bagush at
least nine aircraft were destroyed and several others were damaged. In anotherattack on the airfield at El Adem. five Beaufighters destroyed five Ju. 52s and damaged at least three others.The following are examples of the intensity of our bombing attacks on enemy vehicles. On the night 1st/2nd. Wellingtons and naval Albacores droppedabout 180 tons of H.E. bombs on M.T. and tanks in the northern and centralsectors. The majority of the bombs were seen to burst among the vehicles, and atleast 20 fires were burning simultaneously. On the following night Baltimores.Bostons and U.S. Mitchells and war hawks dropped nearly 140 tons on similartargets.When the enemy began to retreat in the northern sector on the 3rd, our light bombers, fighter-bombers and fighters operated continuously at maximumintensity against slow-moving columns on the main road. The enemy made no attempt to disperse, and therefore offered excellent targets. It is estimated that over 300 vehicles were destroyed or damaged. A.A. guns were silenced and heavy casualties were inflicted on troops. On that day a record number of 1.000daylight sorties were flown by our light bombers and fighters.Heavy attacks were also carried out on enemy strong points, preparatory toattacks by our troops. In one instance, Baltimores, Bostons and Kittyhawksdropped more than 30 tons of H;E. bombs on strong points in the northern sectorwithin 40 minutes. This was followed soon after by six attacks by a total of 72fighter-bombers.Our fighters maintained reconnaissance and offensive patrols over the battle area and provided protection for shipping off the Delta and in the Gulf of Suez.On the 4th, our fighters intercepted two formations of Ju. 87s, escorted byMe. 109s, over the battle area. They forced one formation to jettison its bombs and destroyed eight Ju. 87s and two Me. 109s, probably destroyed ten Ju. 87sand damaged seven others. We lost one Spitfire and five Hurricanes. TwelveSpitfires attacked the dock area at Mersa Matruh, inflicting many casualties onlabourers and troops.Tobruk Harbour was bombed in daylight by U.S. Fortresses. The jettieswere set on fire and a 2,000-ton ship was hit. A photograph taken next dayshowed the ship burnt out.  Benghazi Harbour was bombed by U.S. Liberators.Enemy activity was again primarily of a defensive nature. Dive-bombers and fighter-bombers carried out harassing attacks against our artillery positions.M.T. and tanks. Long-range bombers continued to be used on convoy escort duties, at the expense of bombing operations. There was a material increase inthe number of transport aircraft carrying supplies from Crete to Africa.Malta.51. Our aircraft flew 333 sorties against 394 by the enemy. These totalscompare with 419 and 1,050 respectively last Aveek.There was a continued absence of operations by enemy long-range bombers and a decrease in fighter activity. Our fighters intercepted the enemy formationswell north of Malta, and only a few aircraft reached the Island. Luqa airfieldwas rendered temporarily unserviceable, otherwise damage was negligible.A reinforcement of 36 Spitfires reached the Island during the week.Twenty-nine were flown off a carrier and seven flew from Gibraltar.Crete..52. Maleme airfield was heavily attacked on five nights by Halifaxes andLiberators and by U.S. Liberators and Fortresses. Results were&quot; difficult to observe owing to cloud, but several large fires were started. Attacks were also made on the harbours at Heraklion and Suda Bay, and on gun positions at Caneaand Tymbaki.Sea Communications.53. Two ships of 5,000 and 3,000 tons escorted bv destroyers, course south,were attacked by Wellingtons and Beauforts between Crete and Tobruk. Theships and two destroyers were hit by bombs, the larger ship being set on fire.A convoy consisting of two ships of 1,500 and 1,000 tons and a destrover,on a south-easterly course, was attacked .25 miles north-east of Bomba&quot; by wellingtons and Beauforts.   Both ships were sunk.Wellingtons torpedoed a tanker and a heavily-laden ship, course south,north-west of Benghazi. When last seen the ship was down by the bows. Hitswith bombs were obtained on another ship and on a destroyer.
Two Beaufighters obtained several hits on an east-bound schooner 30 miles east of Empedocle.Naval aircraft attacked with torpedoes a ship and a destroyer east ofHoms (L). but results were not observed.Russia.54. On the Northern &quot;Front German aircraft heavily bombed Murmanskby day and by night, and sank a ship, two tugs and a number of barges on lake ladoga. The Russians raided Helsinki and supply dumps behind the Finnishlines. They also destroyed a train and bombed the garrison of an unspecifiedplace.   In the Kalinin sector activity increased considerably on both sides.On the Central Front the Russians operated with strong forces west of moscow.   The road and railway junctions at Vitebsk were successfully bombed.Although the German Air Force claimed to have damaged two-thirds of the airfields used by the Russians for the defence of Stalingrad, the Russian AirForce continued to operate with success against superior numbers.In the Caucasus the Russian Air Force operated continuously in the Tuapseand Nalchik areas, both in bombing enemy land forces and in air battles.German reports indicate a fairly heavy scale of effort against Russian shipping in the Caspian Sea.During the week ending the 31st October, the Russians claim that theGermans lost 202 aircraft against 128 of their own.Burma.55. - Ten Blenheims bombed the airfields at Pakokku and Shwebo, and on thefollowing day the latter airfield was again attacked by 13 Mohawks; a W.T.station and two aircraft on the ground were damaged. In combat, the Blen-heims destroyed one enemy fighter and damaged two others.Three attacks were made on Lashio, two by escorted U:S. Mitchells and one by U.S.&apos;Kittyhawks operating from China. The runway, a hangar and an A.A.post were hit.   One Kittyhawk was lost.Akyab was bombed by three U.S. Liberators, and several attacks by single aircraft were made on villages and river craft on the Mayu and Kaladanrivers. ,Fifty-five enemy aircraft made an attack on Din j an and aerodromes in north-east Burma. U.S. fighters destroyed a bomber and a fighter, and damagedtwo other aircraft.China.56. The airfield at Kweilin (340 miles N.W. of Hong Kong) wTasattacked by 12 escorted enemy bombers. LT.S. fighters, of which one is missing, intercepted and destroyed three fighters and probably destroyed abomber.Pacific Zone.Neiv Guinea Area.57. Allied medium bombers made three attacks on targets at Lae andSalamoa, and five attacks on enemy positions and M.T. in the Buna/Kokoda area.Three enemy fighters were probably destroyed in combat.A convoy which was attempting to land reinforcements in New Guinea was attacked twice by a total of 14 U.S. Fortresses and ten U.S. Mitchells. Onetransport was hit, two more were probably damaged and four enemy fighters were shot down.Enemy aircraft made two ineffectual raids on Port Moresby.New Britain.58. Nine U.S. Fortresses attacked shipping at Rabaul; one vessel was seton fire and others are believed to have been damaged.A Fortress, reconnoitring Rabaul probably destroyed three enemy fighters.Timor.59.

APPENDIX VII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week : Italy.All reports tell of the success of the recent attacks and of their great effect upon morale. In Genoa there was a definite wave of panic amongst the popula-tion after the first attack. This spread to Milan, and prior to the daylight attack many people had already moved away from the latter city. The daringand skill of the daylight raid&apos; is said to have been praised in Italy, and thedifficulties at Milan to have been accentuated by the fact that part of the fire services had already left to assist the fire-fighters in Genoa. The Genoa autho-rities begged that the King should visit the city to calm the people : a request thatwas acceded to. &apos; At Savona, workmen&apos;s dwellings and industrial targets were hit. Slight damage was also caused at Turin. Casualties at present are reported as.: Genoa 500 killed, Milan 100 killed, and Savona 50 killed:The principal features of damage at present known are : Genoa.The port area suffered the weight of the attack, and damage is described asheavy. The Tirreno fitting-out yards received several hits. Workshops were damaged and the main administrative buildings very severely damaged. several small vessels in the harbour were sunk and two liners damaged. These latter were the Roma and the Augustus, both of over 30,000 tons. The Roma (which isbeing converted into an aircraft-carrier) was hit in two places, but the damage-caused was not very serious and repair work is in progress. The A ugustus, on theother hand, was more severely damaged. Her funnel was split in half and herupper deckwork seriously damaged by fire. There is talk of not proceeding withrepair-work on this ship, and photographs show that she has been removed fromthe Ponte dei Mille, where she was lying at the time of the attack. There is alsoa large crater on this quay, which in peace-time was the embarkation and dis-embarkation quay for Atlantic passenger traffic. The Brignole Station was heavily hit, and public buildings damaged included the Royal Palace, theUniversity and the St. George Palace.Milan.Thirty major and 300 minor fires resulted from the daylight attack, and considerable rail dislocation was caused. The main line at Lambrate was cut andblocked for 24 hours, and the Greco Station on the main line to Chiasso was severely damaged and rail services completely interrupted. Damage to the lineat Lambrate would cause suspension of all traffic south to Bologna and east toVenice, while interference with the main line to Chiasso would cause stoppage ofcoal supplies over the St. Gothard route, one of the principal lines for this classof traffic. Many incidents of damage were caused throughout the city. damage is stated to be most severe in the Via Monforte (to the east of the main station), inthe Porte&quot;&apos;. Genova area1 (where the Genoa railway station was hit), in the PortaTicinese area and. in the Corso Buenos Aires and the Piazza Baconi.Industrial property damaged included the Pirelli Rubber Works and tyredepot. The main station suffered slight damage from a bomb which fell in the square facing the main entrance.Germany.Wilhelmshaven.In the raid on; the 14th/15th September, the naval yards suffered further damage and casualties among the population were very heavy.
