(42) 142nd Con-clusions, Minute 1), the War Cabinet &quot; Invited the Chiefs of Staff to ask the Joint Staff Mission in washington for fuller information about the operations in New Guineaand the Solomon Islands, and for an expression of their opinion as to whythere were such relatively weak American forces in those areas/&apos;2. A telegram from the Joint Staff Mission containing the requiredinformation is attached.(Signed)       E. E. BRIDGES.Great George Street, S.W. 1.,October 30, 1942.Copy of telegram No. J.S.M. 442, dated October 27, 1942, from Joint Staff!&quot;   Mission, Washington, to Chiefs of Staff, London.Reference C.O.S. (W.) 319.The following is the situation in the South and South-West Pacific as we see it, based on the information at our disposal: 1. In July it was clear that Japanese, having established themselves in new Guinea and Solomon Islands, would probably continue to move graduallyeastwards to seize Fiji and other islands in order to cut American line of com-munication with Australia and New Zealand, and establish a defensive barrierfrom^yyhich it would be difficult to eject them.,;2. To put a stitch in this ladder in the stocking before it spread too far,thevAmericans decided to capture Guadalcanal and Tulagi and thus seize theinitiative.3. It seems open to question as to whether it would not have been wiser to&apos; use the forces available to secure the Northern shores of New Guinea and thence stike at Rabaul. But, apart from the fact that this appeared too bigan enterprise at the time, these places were in MacArthurs theatre ofresponsibility, and it may be for this-reason that this possibility was not seriously considered by the American Navy.4. American forces struck on the 8th August at Guadalcanal and Tulagiand, achieving complete surprise, captured Tulagi and gained the airfield on[24556]
Guadalcanal. The blow was well timed, as the landing ground at Guadalcanalhad just been completed, but had as yet an inadequate garrison for its defence.5. This operation was designed to put an immediate stop to the spread ofthe Japanese eastwards to other islands. It owed its success to the rapidity withwhich the forces were organised tor it, but this very rapidly constituted ahandicap to the consolidation of the position gained. There were insufficientarmy troops available to relieve the marines who carried out the assault, andthe marines themselves, being organised for amphibious operations, do not possess the supply and support organisation necessary for protracted operations.There was, moreover, a lack of shipping in the area, particularly of the smallcoastal type necessary in these islands, and heavy bombers had to be based atEspiritu&apos; Santo until a landing strip suitable for bombers could he made atGuadalcanal.6. The retention of Guadalcanal is not only a matter of prestige for theforces of America, but it is of the first importance to check Japanese eastwardor southward aggression. Its retention depends primarily, if not entirely, oncommand at sea in the area. The American losses at save Island and elsewherecaused the American fleet to be withdrawn, and the Japanese, though harriedby American aircraft and suffering losses, were able to land reinforcements.7. There is little doubt that American command was ineffective after the capture of Guadalcanal. There was no urge to reinforce and consolidate theposition gained, and no concerted naval action to strike at the enemy&apos;s naval forces wherever opportunity offered. Nevertheless, spirited air attacks andisolated naval action met with considerable success, and caused the Japanese loss and delay. On the 21st August and again on the 13th September enemy naval units and transports approached Guadalcanal, but withdrew after sufferinglosses from air attack. The Japanese, however, succeeded in landing troops,including guns outranging those of the Americans, on (the north shores ofGuadalcanal on the 25th October, and possibly on other dates in smaller numbers.8. It does not seem that on Guadalcanal to-day the Americans, comprisingtwo marine and one army combat teams (some 20,000 in all) are outnumberedby the Japanese. They may for the time being be able to hold the position.But the Japanese do predominate at sea and may at any time be able further to reinforce their troops, though not without loss by air attack. The airfieldis still in use by all except the heavy bomber type of aircraft, in spite of the factthat it has been bombed and shelled both from the land and from the sea, and losses on it have been heavy.9. However serious the situation on Guadalcanal may be, a new and more serious threat is now developing. A Japanese force in three columns, and believed to include four battleships and three carriers and transports, is driving from thenorth due south, directed on Espiritu Santo. This force, the position of whichis not exactly known, has been sought three times by B. 17&apos;s from Espiritu Santo,but only once located and attacked. It is claimed that two carriers have been hit,the Shokaku and Zuikaku, and are probably out of action for some time.10. A small American force of one battleship and one carrier andattendant cruisers and destroyers, which was moving from Hawaii to join mainAmerican naval forces in south-west Pacific, was ordered to strike at the rear ofthe three Japanese columns. Both the American battleship and the carrier(Enterprise) are now reported to have been hit by bombs and torpedoes. Aboutthe same time the United States aircraft carrier Hornet, operating with the mainAmerican naval forces to the south, was sunk, and transferred her aircraft to the enterprise to be landed at Espiritu Santo.11. Espiritu Santo is an important base area from where the heavy bombershave been striking in support of the Guadalcanal operations. It is believed to contain a great number of aircraft (exact number does not appear to be known),and its organisation as a defended base is far from complete. Its defence, apartfrom its army garrison, will depend upon the B. 17&apos;s based there. Bad weatherhas somewhat restricted their action, but if they can locate the Japanese naval forces there is no doubt that they will act with boldness.12. With the southward movement of the strong Japanese naval forcetowards Espiritu Santo a smaller Japanese force (exact size unknown), alsoapproaching from the north, has reached the island of Malaita and has landedtroops on the Northern shores. Malaita has only a small American garrison,which could not withstand any serious attack.
13. In New Guinea the Allies, consisting of eight Australian infantry brigades with artillery and two American regimental combat teams (some 60,000strong), greatly outnumber the Japanese, who are believed to have landed only12,000. The Japanese acted with great boldness in taking the Owen Stanleymountain passes, but they were unable to maintain these forces south of the ridge,and withdrew.14. The Allies have, moreover, superior air strength, and have repeatedlyand with success struck at Japanese air bases within their reach, includingRabaul.15. At present the Australians are only making local progress, while an american force on a track to the eastward of the pass is attempting to strike at the Japanese left rear.16. The fact is that at present no serious attack on the northern ports ofNew Guinea by land, except possibly Buna, is possible because of the difficultyof maintenance, and no seaborne attack can be made while American naval forces and shipping are so heavily engaged elsewhere.17. General MacArthur has been doing what he can to assist the SolomonIsland operations by striking at Rabaul and. Shortland Island with long-range bombers. Port Moresby is not, however, an entirely satisfactory base from which to operate. Apart from its distance from Rabaul, it is exposed to attack fromthe three Japanese air bases on the north of New Guinea to an extent which has sofar prevented it from being used as a permanent base for heavy bombers.18. It is felt in some quarters that the operations in South-West Pacificas a whole are suffering from the fact that they are not under one command. TheAmerican navy would hardly appreciate being put under General MacArthur&apos;command, and General MacArthur&apos;s command could hardly be made subordinateto Admiral Nimitz.19. Operations in the South-West Pacific have entered a critical phase.The serious naval losses which the Americans have sustained, particularly in aircraft carriers, render their ability to command the seas problematical. Theirhope of retrieving this dangerous situation lies in their superiority in air forces,particularly in heavy bombers. These air forces will be used with boldness, andthe approach of the Japanese naval forces to Espiritu Santo may give them greatopportunities.20. Should Guadalcanal fall, as well it may, and should Espiritu Santo alsobe taken, which appears less likely, the Americans will be thrown back on NewCaledonia and Fiji. Australian fears will be multiplied and difficulties of a renewed American offensive will be greatly increased. The drain of aircraft and shipping to the Pacific will increase.2335Z/27.
