Additional points;(f)   The original proposal to manufacture Mustangs wholly in U.K. is not now favoured.   The proposal to provide erection capacity only would not result(g)   Owing to the time necessary for U.S. to make the necessary alterations(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)*m-on. .......... nrr,m-M,..,. ................-secret * -Copy No.   3.W.P. (42)49429th October, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY,It is requested that special care may betaken to ensure the secrecy of this document.MINISTER OF PRODUCTION&apos;S VISIT to america,(Previous Paper Y/.P. (42)486, also J.W.P.S.  (42^ 84 Final).At the meeting of the Chiefs of Staff on the 29th October I v/as askedto amplify certain points in my note of the 27th October, I now circulate the f following memorandum.Paragraph 5 .(ii)The main reasons in favour of the Mustang Merlin proposal are asfollows:-(a) Only in this way vail American pilots in U.K. obtain a fighter whichwill be good enough against the enemy1 s best.    Out of the 400 Mustangs a month,300 would, in the first instance, be flown by American pilots and 100 would beavailable to the R.A.F. to fulfil American obligations for replacement &quot;aircraft for American types in service with the R.A.F.(b) The Americans would send over a strong technical staff who would thus be able to keep pace with technical developments in a &quot;way which would beimpossible in U. S.    They would become quality minded and this would have its -repercussions in U.S.-(c) The proposal is strongly favoured by Mr, &quot;Winant, Mr. Harriman,Mr. Ted Wright, Mr. Hedgcock (U. S. test pilot) and other Americans who support us most strongly for quality.(d) The main shortages in U.K. are skilled labour, machine tools and capacity for fabricating light alloys. All these would be found in U. S. ifthe Mustang were ore-fabricated and the engines mo.de in U. S. The resourcesrequired to erect Mustangs in this country could produce less than half thenumber of, say, Spitfires and even then we should require raw material and additional machine tools, from U. S. Pre-f abrication in U, S, and erection inthis country would save a considerable amount of shipping.(o)   Our Spitfire production is at present mainly concentrated inCastle Bromwich and Southampton.   The Mustang proposed, would result in one,and possibly two, additional insurances a.gainst enemy action by bombing.

to take the Merlin engine and to produce ?nd ship pre-fabricatod peaces, it ionot expected that ISistangs could &quot;be erected in this country &quot;before mid-1943.(h)   Tho original Mustang was a private venture in U. S. which was naaocdover by the U.S. Array Mr Corps but adopted and ordered from U.K.   The U.S.A.A.C.arc, therefore, likely to he prejudiced against it.Paragraph 5 (iii)It is not yet possible tc state the time or the extent of the loss in heavy bombers which would he involved in r. change over to Lancasters.The Stirling, Halifax and v7ellingtcn may be involved out a decision as to   &apos;&quot;which aid when must wait upon investigations now being made and due for review jr. Friday, 30th October.    whatever tho loss it --ill not begin to bofelt until after r.dd.-19L3.     ny loss will be impossible under the Prime:;inister&apos;s directive to increase the bomb carrying capacity on a steadilyrising curve throughout 1S45 unless it can be compensated for by AmericanHeavy &quot;bombers delivered to us on a firm contract and fit for night flyingand ether operations required in this theatre.Parngruph 9 - Shipping Rc-.xidrenentc.Lord Leathers is prepsring me a brief justifying a request to the americans for transfer to this country of 2J? million dead weight tons insteadof 2 million as stated in the paper.    Lord Leathers&apos; calculations will showthat wo shall need this amount of shipioing throughout the year if wo are toreach 27 million tons cf importation,Parat-raph 12The last&apos;point raised concerned the figure of 750,000 persons, whichis stated in paragraph 12 as tho deficit by the end cf This figurerepresents the absolute minimum deficit, based on administrative calctilatiensof the further possible intake, end taking into -account that there may be somereductions in the requirement figures.   No precise figure cf the gap that mustbo filled by curtailment of British programmes can be given until the &quot;warCabinet has examined the labour situation as a whole end decided, among other things, what further sacrifice&quot; are- expedient in :,less essential&quot; industries.If the requirements stand at 2v million men and -women, the &quot;gap&quot; may bera^vthdng up to l4 jv&amp;Ilion.O.L.Ministry of Production,Great George Street,o.
