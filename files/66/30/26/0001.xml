R, A.Dominions Office, October 30, 1942.REPORT OF COMMITTEE APPOINTED TO EXAMINE the establishments OF THE THREE SERVICES.1. AT the War Cabinet&apos;s special meeting on the 28th July, 1942, on theShipping Situation, we were appointed as a Cabinet Committee with the following terms of reference : &quot; To examine the establishments of the three Services. The object ofthis Inquiry would be to reduce the overall numbers in non-combatant roles,and thus to facilitate any necessary increases in combatant troops.&quot;2. The Inquiry was directed mainly to Army establishments, and we have so limited it. It emerged at an early stage that it is a mistake to regard thenumber of 40,000 men as an accurate standard for a British Infantry Division&apos; that figure only related to the establishment of a Division in the Middle East.Accordingly, we made our starting-point the examination in some detail ofvarious Headquarter establishments, and the scrutiny of the Order of Battle and establishment of a complete Corps in this country (not earmarked for overseasoperations). The 11th Corps District was taken for this purpose, consisting ofone higher establishment division and two lower establishment divisions; the overall total of 17,434 per division for this Corps represented the actual total of personnel allotted to it so far back as and including Corps troops, but excludingstatic installations. Examination on paper of these establishment figures revealedsigns of apparent over-elaboration to name one, the &quot; one-job one-officer &quot; (withattendant clerk, batman and driver) principle was a common feature of the estab-lishments which we examined. There appeared to be a marked degree ofspecialisation of function, the full justification, of which would have called fora follow-up to examine matters &quot; on the ground,&quot; It appeared to us, further,that the proportion of officers to men in our Army was high, and that the ratio of fighting to administrative units in the British Army ought to be measuredagainst some outside yardstick.[24558]
3. Our next step was to make a comparison between British, German and american Divisions, including transport in each case. Such comparisons are difficult to base on common ground, and differences of terminology are apt toobscure the issue. The American Divisions were, in our opinion, less likely tobe worth study than the Germans. In both Infantry and Armoured Divisions itdefinitely appeared that the British overall proportion of officers to men is higherthan the German, due to a proportionate excess in the fighting units (the oppositetendency, though in less marked degree, occurs in administrative units, where theGermans use a higher ratio of officers to men than we do). The ratio of fightingto administrative units as between British and German Divisions varies accordingto the premises adopted. On our first analysis, it looked as though our rearwardservices, in both Infantry and Armoured Divisions, were in excess of thosedeployed by the Germans to support a given number of fighting men. The WarOffice, however, have produced to us a detailed functional comparison, appendedherewith, with a wider ambit for definition of the &quot; fighting &quot; category. It willbe seen from this that the proportion of staff in administrative units to those in fighting units is 1:5-9 for both British and German units on the infantry division comparison; on the Armoured Division comparison, the corresponding figure is 1 : 4-8 for the British and 1:4-7 for the Germans.As regards transport, no marked difference in the proportion of vehicles perman in the two Armies has appeared from our investigation.4. We have had the benefit of the Adjutant-General^ views on certain points which had come up during the Inquiry, in particular : (i) the causes of the relatively high ratio of officers to men in our Army, andthe possibility of reducing the number of *&apos; specialist &quot; officers we use;(ii) the functions performed by the Rear services of the British Army onbehalf of other Services and on behalf of Allied troops, both at homeand abroad.As to (i), we believe that there is a danger of specialists, who should have completed their initial task and become free for other duties, being embodied and taking their place permanently as in a sealed pattern. We are satisfied that theGermans do with less officers proportionately and, as the Adjutant-Generalagreed, that the time has come for further pruning, particularly of specialists inthe Corps. It is true that many specialist activities, e.g., those of the judge advocate-General, Salvage, Catering, &amp;c, are a reflection of our democratic formof government, and that a proportion of the specialists are of low medical categoryand would not be fit for combatant duties; but a cut in these numbers would leadto ancillary economies elsewhere. Moreover, as Divisions went overseas, a cutcould be made in the number of Corps H.Q. officers.As to (ii), the Adjutant-General gave us a picture of the extent to whichthe Army &quot; rearward services,&quot; besides serving the Army, acted as the thirdline for the Royal Air Eorce, providing them with food, water and clothingas well as building roads and aerodromes. Similarly, the Army acted in a senseas the Ministry of Supply for Egypt, supervising the production of ordnancestores, &amp;c., from salvaged or local materials. In West Africa likewise, whitesupervision of black labour is taking shape on a large scale.5. None the less, we think that it emerges from our inquiries that thesystem of having more or less rigid establishments must be conducive to waste of man-power. The tendency towards undue specialisation already mentionedextends, in our view, to other ranks as well as to officers. A new idea sets up anew service which secures a place in the establishment, and then all these newservices attempt to justify their creation, and tend to grow independently and sometimes divergently. There is almost certainly room for telescoping two (ormore) of these specialist functions, and man-power shortage, no less than theneed for economies in shipping-space, dictate the necessity for some suchconcentration or, more precisely, reconcentration. A possible application ofthis &apos;&apos; dual purpose &apos;&apos; principle is in the field of vehicles. We have been told that the shortage of highly skilled tradesmen in the Army leaves no alternative to the policy laid down for the manning and repair of vehicles, viz., withdrawingskilled personnel from forward units in order that they may be pooled and usedto the best general advantage at the base depots; but we feel that its applicationhas led to Ordnance workshops being flooded out with minor jobs, to a dissipationof the enthusiasm of vehicle teams and to waste of time and petrol. We have,accordingly, asked the War Office to re-examine the personnel of vehicle and
tank crews on the basis of their present skill, with a view to the possible extensionof the schedule of permissive repairs.6. We have examined the figures of the Non-Field Force units in theUnited Kingdom, whose actual strength (over 600,000 men) accounts for some35 per cent, of the total strength of all units in the United Kingdom. Itappeared that there is a tendency for the allotments made periodically by theGeneral Staff on the basis of what can theoretically be spared for thesenon-combatant units to be adjusted upwards to fit the prevailing strengths, ratherthan for strengths to be brought into line with what is theoretically available outof the total man-power allowed to the Army. While appreciating that, since theArmy does not stand still, the allotments cannot remain static, we have formed the view that, whatever other purpose they serve, the General Staff allotments donot act as an effective check on the day-to-day size of the Non-Field Army. Thefigures for allotment and strength in August 1942 were 503,000 and 613,814respectively, whereas the same figures for September 1942 were 610,000 and613,266 respectively. There seems to be no reason why between August and september the allotment should have been stepped up by 107,000, that is, over20 per cent., especially in view of the fact that it had remained almost staticsince the previous April. Either the allotment is meaningless and indeedmisleading or else there should have been a reduction between April and Augustof 100,000 in the strength to make it fit in with the allotment. Of the strengthof the Non-Field army as at the 1st September, 1942 (613,000), static units,viz., R.A.S.C.. R.A.M.C., R.A.O.C., Pioneers, and the like, account for some130,000 men, and staffs, schools and miscellaneous units for 60,000 more. Theincrease in static and miscellaneous units is primarily due to this country beingthe base for overseas operations, these units covering supply and stores services which increase in proportion with the increase in forces overseas. In consideringtheir size, account should be taken of the services of which the Army relieves theRoyal Air Force, and allowance should be made for the extent to which, notably in the Pay Corps, A.T.S. and civilian women have already been introducedalongside Service men, outside the numbers stated above.7. We cannot say that we have been able to adduce evidence in general support of the underlying assumption of our terms of reference, viz., that the ratio of rearward to fighting services is excessive on an overall basis. That isnot to say that, in circumstances of acute shortage of man-power, cuts in the rear services will not have to be made. The changes which have already beenmade by the Service Departments, and which have been proceeding simultaneously with our Inquiry, have indeed sometimes been in this, though they have alsobeen in the reverse, direction. A Committee such as ours cannot, of course,operate as a whole-time commission, paying random visits here and there up and down the country, or, alternatively, visiting selected units which had appearedfrom our earlier investigations to be deserving of detailed scrutiny.8. In conclusion, we do not see any alternative to fixing a total for each service, in the light of competing demands on man-power and of strategic requirements, leaving each Service to make the best possible use of its available resources within such overall limit. Decision on these lines would be a matter for the War Cabinet, who would have to decide not only the ceilings respectively to be allocated to the three Services, but also, in broad terms, the number of fighting units to be got out of those allocations. In particular, it would be forthe Army authorities to make such adjustments in Establishments as to providethe number and type of Divisions which the War Cabinet demanded.C. R. A.R. S. C.A.
