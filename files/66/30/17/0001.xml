We have considered operations in the Solomons and in new Guinea separately.       Operations in the Solomons are underthe control of Vice Admiral  Halsc^    whose headquarters are in new Caledonia, while operations in New Guinea are under general macarthur, whose headquarters are in Brisbane.      information available on operations in the Solomons is scanty.      information on this area contained in this report is largely conjectural.American conrnmiiques are the ixsual sources of information.     Inthis connection it is pointed Out that the U.S. Army Authoritiesdivulge information more freely than the U.S. naval authorities.     Moreover, so far as wo can judge, the array are notkept fully informed by the Navy.3.      The first Japanese landings in tho South West Pacific area were made at Rabaul (New Britain) on 22nd January, 194-2 and atCavieng (New Ireland) on 23rd January.     The Japanese have since then developed this area as their main base for operations bothagainst New Guinea and against the Solomons.OPERATIONS IN HEW GUINEA.4.      The Japanese first landed at Lae and Salomon on the 7thand 8th March, 1942, where they encountered one AustralianIndependent Company.     Following their landing, the Japanese- advanced northwards up the Markham Valley but were forced backby floods and tropical rains.      Since then, no major Japaneseoffensive has taken place from this area.5.      In May,  the Japanese attempted a direct sea assault onPort Moresby by approximately 1 division in transports escorted by Naval Forces.      The f :-rce was located by Allied naval and airforces, resulting in the engagement known as the &quot;Battle ofthe Coral Seas&quot;.     The Japanese have not since attempted a directseaborne assault.6,     In July, the Japanese began their overland attack on Port-Moresby by landing in the Gona-Buna area with a force of about,000 men,      In spite of Allied resistance by about 1,500 men atKokoda, the Japanese crossed the Owen Stanley Range by the6th September, and by the 13th, had reached a point 25 miles north of Port Moresby,     By the 24th September,  supply difficulties and the stiffening of Allied resistance   had brought theRABAUL.H C.0.S.(48)294th meeting, Minute 2.

Japanese to a halt at lorabaiwao     Harassed by an air offensive against their lines of communication^   they then withdrew overthe Owen Stanley Range to their present position atTempleton&apos;s Crossing, 10 miles south of Kokoda, where the australians are still on the offensive.7o     During this advance, Allied Air Forces carried outvigorous raids on enemy aerodromes in New Guinea, on transportsand landing craft,  and also on their lines of communication,particularly on the Wairopi Bridge, over the Kumusi RiverAs a result of these heavy raids throughout August and september, the aerodrome at Buna has been rendered unserviceable.Ho use has been made of the landing ground at Gona nor of the aerodrome at Kokoda which were demolished by the Allies beforeevacuation in July.-      The aerodromes both at Lao and Salamoaare reported to be unserviceable,  and the. aircraft reportedto be at Lae in July appear to have been withdrawn for use in operations against tho Solomon. Islandsu       There arc to-day noJapanese aircraft based on New Guinea-80    &apos;While the operations from Gone and Buna were in progressthe Japanese landed on 26th August on the eastern extremityof New Guinea,  at Milne Bay, with a force of about one regimentin order to establish themselves on tho aerodrome on the flank of Port Moresby:.      But they were forestalled by an Australianbrigade who surprised ohem, broke them up, and re-established allied control in the areac     This was followed by prolonged mopping-upoperations which duly liquidated the Japanese*     An Australian forceof about 500 men has   recently landed at Collingwood Bay, betweenMilne Bay and Gonao9.      Progress by the Allied Forces In New Gu:nea though slowis continuingoOPERATIONS IN THE&apos;SOLOMON ISLANDS.10*     After their unsuccessful direct assault on Port Moresby,the Japanese continued their penetration into the South EastSolomons, and landed at Tulagi on the 22nd May, following thisby occupying Guadalcanal Island and developing the airfieldthere.     No effective&quot;Allied resistance could bo offered against these attacks, and, by the beginning of August, the Japanese had established seaplane bases at Buka Island, Birln(Bougainville Island), Giso Ieland,  and Rekata Bay (Isabel Island).11.      American forces based on New Caledonia and New Zealandcounter-attacked on the 6th August, and after 5 days fightingcaptured Tulagi and Florida Islands and tho airfield onGuadalcanal Island.      Comparative figures are difficult to estimate,but the probable Japanese strength was then 4-6,000 against which 10,000 United States Marines were ultimately deployed.12. By the 10th August, the United States Navy Departmentclaimed that major Japanese resistance had been overcome onGuadalcanal and Florida Islands.13.     But from the end of tho first week in September theJapanese began a serious attempt to regain these positions.By landings from transports and by infiltration at night using smallboats they have built up a force of about 12,000 men onGuadalcanal Island.      It is thought that a full-scale landattack will shortly take place on the American positionssurrounding the Guadalcanal airfield.      This airfield is undoubtedly the key to the position in the S.I3.  Solomons, for as long as the americans can make effective use ef it,  any full-scale Japaneseseaborne attack will be liable to heavy damage.

14.     The Navy Department declared   on 15/10 that 57 Japanese vessels of all types had been sunk   or damaged and 291 aircraft shot down sinethe beginning of the operation in the Solomons.The greater part of these losses wore inflicted by theUnited States and Allied Aircraft operating both from GuadalcanalIsland and Australia.     They have maintained a high level of activity and have attacked enemy shipping in the South west pacific wherever seen.15.     According to an American Navy Department Communiqueof the 18th October, Marine and Army Units are having the better of the struggle in Guadalcanal, Island   but despite thisreassuring statement, the Americans are having supply difficulties and the position must he regarded as critical.      The japanese have a large fleet still intact to the north of the island;they are bringing up aircraft from the Netherlands East Indies;and they have some 45,000 men in the base area at Rabaul.      Itis believed that further land reinforcements are on their way.COMPARISON OP JAPANESE AND ALLIED STRENGTHS IN THE SOUTHWEST PACIFIC.16.
