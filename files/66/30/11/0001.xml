STRENGTH OF BOMBER COMMAND.Secretary of State for Air. M. 378/2.C.A.S.1. It is necessary that the Bomber Command at home should be raised from 32 operating squadrons, which it now has, to 50 squadrons fully operative,by the end of the year. The expansion should be progressive. No Americansquadrons should be counted. Let me have the best plan that you can make for achieving this prime military object. For this purpose you should bring undernew and close scrutiny all the following spheres, so as to obtain Squadrons.From the Coastal Command        ...      ...      ...      ... 2From the Air-borne division        ...      ...      ...      ... 1By restricting the flow of heavy bombers to the middle east and India ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... by improving the  working-up arrangements  of  the bomber Command itself so as to make operationaladditional ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... by present promised increase from M.A.P.      ...      ... 9Bv further exertions of M.A.P. additional       ...      ... 2Total .........      ...      ...      ...    182. You should, of course, vary these apportionments if the same result canbe produced more conveniently. When the resulting plan has been shaped, i will bring it before the War Cabinet and ask for discussion and approval. Itwill then become binding and will have, within the above limits and for theabove period, priority over every other competing claim.w. s. c.17.9.42.Prime Minister.Your Minute M.378 of the 17th September.2. There are now 37 Heavy and Medium Bomber squadrons in bomber command of which 32 are operational. The other five will become operationalwithin the next few weeks. The problem, therefore, is to form 13 new bomber squadrons and make them operational before the end of the year. Simultaneously,the operational training organisation must be enlarged.3. The dominant factor in this problem is the supply of aircraft whichgoverns both the formation of the squadrons and the training of the crews. Newsquadrons to be operational by the end of the year must be formed before theend of November, so that from the production standpoint October and Novemberare the vital months.4. I accordingly asked the Ministry of Aircraft Production to let me know what output of Heavy and Medium Bombers could be counted on during thisperiod on the assumption that a special effort is made. The Minister promptlysummoned the heads of the aircraft building firms and exhorted them to increase their production. As a result he has promised to supply 780 Halifaxes, Stirlingsand Lancasters during September, October and November, which is fewer than[24505]
were forecast in the M.A.P. programme issued on the 28th September. As formedium bombers, so far as I can ascertain from the figures now supplied, while no additional output is anticipated from factory production, some 140 moreaircraft will be provided by accelerated output from aircraft storage units (thistakes account of the supply of 100 Albemarles to Russia). These promises arecontingent on the fulfilment of the Ministers outstanding demands for labourand machine tools. The Minister has, however, offered a further contributionto the plan by a reduction in the pool of aircraft used for experimental anddevelopment purposes.5. Estimates prepared on the basis of the Ministers figures show that,failing additional measures to ensure the completion of the plan, we shall fall short of the target by five squadrons. Against this deficiency can be set theagreement of the First Sea Lord to the return to Bomber Command of two ofthe four Medium Bomber squadrons now on loan to Coastal Command. One ofthese squadrons is returning immediately, the second by the 1st November.6. The net deficiency is, therefore, three squadrons, and this must bebridged within the next two months. A short-term acceleration of this kindcan only be effected by an immediate cut in some of our external commitments for heavy and medium bombers.7.   My proposals are as follows : (a) Airborne Forces. The Airborne Forces constitute a heavy commitment for medium bombers, which, though obsolescent, are suitable for operational bomber training. Over 100 medium bombers are alreadyso employed, and during the next two months about 100 additionalbombers will be needed to provide for further expansion and wastage.To carry out the 50-squadron plan the flow of heavy and medium bombers to the Airborne Forces must be suspended over the next twomonths. This will mean that the Airborne Division must curtail itstraining programme and live for a time on its existing resources.More drastice recommendations respecting the future develop-ment of Airborne Forces will shortly be under discussion on the Chiefsof Staff Committee.(b) Middle East. The flow of heavy bombers to the Middle East is now atthe rate of eight per month. I propose to halve this commitmentand to arrange for the aircraft to be flown out to the Middle Eastby Ferry Command pilots, thus effecting an economy in both crewsand aircraft.I am most reluctant to interfere with the flow of Wellingtons tothe Middle East in view of the very heavy potential commitments of the medium bomber force there and in India. While, therefore,I propose no cut in the allocation of medium bombers for overseas,I am arranging that roughly one-third of the monthly quota shouldbe flown out by Ferry Command crews.Crews.8. So much for aircraft. A small deficiency in crew requirements will bebridged by a number of expedients, including an acceleration of the return oftour-expired pilots from the Middle East.Maintenance Personnel.9. An increased supply of mechanics to Bomber Command is an indispensable requirement of the plan. If the squadrons are to be ready in timethe Operational Training Units must be brought up to strength in ground staffimmediately, and the men must be available for the new squadrons as theyare formed.The economies in the provision for Airborne Forces will meet part of the commitment. In addition, a start must be made with the gradual return to theRoyal Air Force of the airmen now on loan to the aircraft industry. Thebalance will be found by an immediate decision to give priority to bomber command over all other Commands for the next three months. In the meantime,the intensive scrutiny of existing establishments, which has been going on forsome time, will, it is hoped, make good to some extent the losses of the otherCommands by means of economies.10. Provision has been made for a progressive development of trainingcapacity to match the accelerated rate of expansion.11. It is important that the Ministry of Aircraft Production should fulfill their part of the plan without reduction in the spares programme.   Any such
reduction would react most sharply on our ability to operate the forceeffectively.12. The most serious brake in the past on Bomber expansion has been theextraneous commitments, from which it will henceforth be freed by yourassurance that this 50-Squadron plan will have priority over every other claim.13. If these proposals are approved, I believe that 50 Heavy and Mediumbomber squadrons will be operational by the end of the year. Thus the presenthitting power of Bomber Command will be increased in three months by morethan half.A. H. M. S.October 9, 1942.Secretary of State for Air. M. 455/2.1. I agree that the development of the Airborne Division may be retardedfor two months within the limits you suggest; but it will certainly have to be expanded, and pressed forward in the Spring, as it may have a great strategic and political role to play in the summer of 1943.2. I hope it will not be necessary to withdraw any of the Airmen nowr lentto industry except in very special cases of key men, without whom more bomberscannot be flown.  Anyhow, this should be the last source to tap.3. Subject to the above, your proposals seem to me admirably conceived tosecure the massive war objective in view. The papers must now be brought beforethe Chiefs of Staffs Committee, as both the other Services are affected.W. S. C.16.10.42.
