THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT^Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 475.October 16, 1942.WAR CABINET.POSTHUMOUS HONOURS AND AWARDS.Note by the Prime Minister.IN reply to a recent Question in the House about posthumous awards, Ipromised to consider the matter again.I attach a memorandum on the subject which has been prepared at my request.W. S. C.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,October 16, 1942.Memorandum on Posthumous Honours and Awards.A question on the subject of posthumous Honours was addressed to thePrime Minister on the 20th May and Mr. Attlee replied as follows :  &quot; This question was reviewed in October 1939 by the Committee on thegrant of Honours, Decorations and Medals in time of war, and in Februarythis year by the Chiefs of Staff Committee. The main purpose ofdecorations is to reward the living, and it has always been felt to be fittingand dignified that posthumous grants should be limited to the very highestawards for gallantry. Moreover, a high proportion of fatalities occur whenacts of heroism leave no surviving witnesses. To extend the system to otherHonours would make it extremely difficult to justify in the eyes of thenext-of-kin the great numbers of necessary exclusions.&quot;[24506]
The matter was reviewed on several occasions during and after the FourYears&apos; war, again in 1938. and subsequently, as mentioned in the reply above.2. On the 29th September the Prime Minister answered a similar question by reference to the above reply. The supplementary questions and answers were as follows : &quot;Mr. Thomas: Although I cannot at this moment recollect the reply,will the right hon. Gentleman consider giving posthumous decorations to persons mentioned in despatches, at least in cases where they deserve it?The Prime Minister : I have thought a good deal about this, and I knowit is being carefully studied, but hitherto opinion has been against multiply-ing posthumous decorations.Sir W. Davison : In view of recent events, is it not possible for theCommittee which has been giving careful consideration to this matter to reconsider it ?The Prime Minister : I will consider that.Sir W. Bavison : Thank you.&quot;3. The military awards which may be given posthumously for services inaction with the enemy are the Victoria Cross. Mention in Despatches andCommemorative Campaign Medals. For Indian troops there is in addition theIndian Order of Merit. This, when created, was the highest Indian award forgallantry.The civil awards which may be granted posthumously are the George Cross,the Albert Medal, the King&quot;s Police and Fire Services Medal, for gallantry, theEdward Medal, confined to industry, and the Sea Gallantry Medal. All theseare of an extremely high standard. Commendations for brave conduct, may alsobe awarded posthumously. The George Cross may be given in the military services for actions not in the presence of the enemy. The Albert Medal is also given very occasionally in the Royal Navy for acts of gallantry in saving life.Very rarely a Peerage or Baronetcy has been conferred on a son in respectof services rendered, by a deceased parent, and. in exceptional circumstances,rank has been granted to a widow as though she were the relict of a KnightCommander of the Order of the Bath.4. If it were proposed to consider making a recommendation for theextension of the system of posthumous awards, it would be necessary to haveregard, to the position of all the following awards : Military gallantry atvards :D.S.6.. D.S.C., M.C.. D.F.C., D.C.M., C.G.M.. D.S.M., M.M.. D.F.M.,I.D.S.M., B.G.M. (Burma Gallantry Medal).Military awards for good service, also available for gallantry :R.R.C.. A.R.R.C.
Awards available for military personnel for gallantry not in the presenceof the enemy, also given for good service :O.B.E., M.B.E., B.E.M.(The position of the C.B., C.S.I., C.I.E., C.B.E. might also require consideration. The C.B., however, though given for services inaction, is not usually regarded as a personal gallantry award.)Award available for military personnel for gallantry not in the presence ofthe enemy :G.M.Civil award for gallantry in any circumstances :G.M.Civil axvards for gallantry in any circumstances, also given for good service :O.B.E., M.B.E.. B.E.M.It will be seen that an extension of the present system would requirealterations in a large number of Statutes and Warrants and would involve a notinconsiderable change in the Honours system as a whole.5. As was stated in the reply by Mr. Attlee on the 20th May, this question has been considered since the outbreak of war by the Committee on the grant ofHonours, Decorations and Medals in time of war. and also b5r the Chiefs of staff committee. Among the difficulties which impressed these Committees, thefollowing may be mentioned.One of the main problems is the difficulty of selection when a vessel either in the Fleet or the Merchant Navy has gone down after a gallant action and nosurvivors, or very few, remain. It is, in practice, impossible to make a selectionon good grounds from among all the dead; in fact, the selection might again and again be in favour of the wrong man.Much the same applies to aircraft crews. Frequently all members of a creware lost together. To grant a posthumous award by selection without justificationand without knowledge of the circumstances from among all the dead would bea matter of the greatest difficulty.If posthumous awards were to be made in such circumstances, perhaps byrank or blindly with a pin, the result, it has been thought, would ultimately beto cause far more dissatisfaction than gratification among the next-of-kin.Clearly, the number of recipients would be only a fraction of the total of thebereaved.Another difficulty which would arise if some new practice were authorisednow in the middle of this war would be the demand for the examination of allpast cases. Requests would be made for the consideration of the circumstancesof the death of all those killed in action, so that those who have already given their lives would be treated on the same basis as those who are killed during theremainder of the war.
(i. The Canadian Government grant forthwith to the next-of-kin a smallsilver memorial cross hanging from a narrow purple mourning ribbon ofminiature width. This was the practice in Canada in the Four Years&apos; War. andthe Canadian Government are using now exactly the same design.They and the other Dominions. India and the Colonies are all using theRoyal Message of Condolence. It has not been thought desirable to consider theinstitution here as yet of any permanent memorial other than the Royal Message.In respect of services in the last war the next-of-kin received, after the war. inaddition to the commemorative campaign medals and any emblems in respectof mentions, a bronze plaque some six inches across and an inscribed memorialmessage. It has been considered up to now that before venturing on presentationsof this kind, we should await events to discover what the volume of casualties islikely to be, and how far casualties in the merchant navy, in civil defence, thenational fire service, the police and so forth should be included in any such scheme. This course has been approved. There are obvious objections at thepresent time to the use of the metal, the labour in production and so forth.The Royal Message of Condolence is. therefore, at present the permanentmemento for retention by the next-of-kin.It is important to note that a Mention in Despatches may be grantedposthumously, and that the appropriate Honours which become the propertyof the next-of-kin. in the case of death in action or during hostilities, are thecommemorative campaign medals which may be instituted, together, in particularinstances, with any authorised despatches emblem which may be awarded.Treasury, October 7. 1942.
