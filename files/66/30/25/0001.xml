I have much sympathy with the view that it would be in the&apos;-test interests of. the British civilians in Malta who are not engaged onssential services that thev should be.evacuated.      But this considerationopinioncivilians oncomment in Malta, andthe people at this time.services that the .     .-J plies with hardly less force to the Maltese.

Such a Conclusion could hai aeLjyave. a depressing effect on public morale generally and it might naveIncreasing privation, heavy n tr attacks areIf. at this juncture it becomes known, thattheleavetofail topermanently
permanently damaging results on the&quot;political relations&quot; &quot;betweenthe British and tho Maltose.6.       I do not suggest that a complete can on tho use oftho improved opportunities available for removing non-essential-personnel from Malta should be maintained, hut it is not advisablein my judgment for the Government to he associated with any active measures for compelling .or encouraging civilians, whetherBritish or Malteseto leave the colony, or with any policy which&apos;involves discrimination in this&apos; matter between the tv/o  races.I suggest therefore that the present policy in regard to theevacuation of civilians from Malta should be relaxed to  the extent that the Government should be prepared to accept applications from,and to allot passages to,  any non-essential persons who apply for permission to leave Malta without discrimination between British andMaltese.      Persons so -evacuated whether it.&quot;be via Cairo and the Cape orvia Gibraltar should be provided with&quot; free&apos; passages to the UnitedKingdom, and.in the case of Maltese it will be necessary for special arrangements to bo made for tho maintenance of those who are unableto pay for themselves.      There should be no compulsion, no discrimination-,  and no official encouragement to anyone to leaveMalta.&quot; M. .7.        If this policy is approved by the Cabinet I should proposeto consider in consultation&quot; with the Minister of Health -and. the-&quot;Governor the steps which should be taken to carry it into effect.The extent to which -evacuation on these lines could be carried would-depend to some extent on the numbers of Maltese who applied forpassages arid were&quot; unable to &quot;make provision for themselves in thiscountry.      It is quite impossible to estimate&apos; what numbers would be involved.      If no special publicity is given to the matter in Malta Ishould expect the numbers to be small-, but the flow to this country of Maltose who arc-unable to provide for themselves would have to be regulated with due regard to the arrangements which can be made fortheir accommodation here.C.Colonial Office.30th October 194 2.
