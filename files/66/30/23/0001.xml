NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.I. Naval and air operations in the Solomons have increased in intensity.Successful attacks on enemy shipping in the Eastern Mediterranean havebeen maintained.Three convoys have been attacked by U-boats in the North Atlantic. Ship-ping losses in consequence have been heavy.Two U-boats have been sunk by our submarines.Mediterranean.2. To assist operations by the 8th Army, a feint sea-borne landing wasmade by light naval craft on the night of 23rd/24th west of Ras el Kanais.Despite enemy air attacks, our forces returned safely; one M.T.B. was slightly damaged.3. H.M. Submarines report the following attacks : Traveller torpedoed anorthbound tanker of 6.000 tons west of Crete on the 9th, and one of the escortingdestroyers may also have been torpedoed. On the 12th and 13th Thrasher sank two 200-ton schooners west of Lemnos and on the 20th she sank a 2,000-tonescorted ship north-west of Rhodes. P. 37 sank an escorting destroyer inaddition to the ship previously reported, in convoy south of Lampion on the 19th.P. 35 on the 23rd torpedoed a ship which was aground near Horns (L) as a resultof an air attack.4. H.M. Trawler Ronaldshay was torpedoed and sunk by aircraft on the night of the 21st/22nd at Port Safagi (northern end of Red Sea).5. During the week, 23,920 tons of French merchant shipping westbound,and 36,237 tons eastbound, have passed Gibraltar under escort.Black Sea.6. Russian M.T.B&apos;s have made night attacks in the Black Sea. On the23rd a tanker was probably sunk in the bay west of Sevastopol. On the 25th atug and two landing craft w7ere sunk at Anapa. Russian aircraft sank an E-boat and a schooner at Anapa on the 24th.Russian submarines sank two medium-sized ships off the mouth of the danube on the 7th and the 21st. Two Roumanian destroyers were also sunk by russian submarines on the 7th and 14th September respectively.South Atlantic.7. H.M. Cruiser Phcebe was torpedoed off Pointe Noire on the 23rcl but was able to reach port.Pacific.8. On the 25th, Japanese destroyers sank a U.S. Fleet tug and a smallpatrol boat near Tulagi. Shore batteries shelled the destroyers and two ofthem were later sunk by U.S. dive-bombers.9. It was reported on the 27th that during a co-ordinated land, sea and air attack against U.S. positions on Guadalcanal Island three enemy cruisers andtwo aircraft-carriers had been damaged. Another aircraft-carrier was torpedoed.The U.S. Destroyer Porter was sunk and a U.S. aircraft-carrier severely damaged.10. In recent engagements in the Gilbert Islands two Japanese patrol craft were sunk and a destroyer and a merchant ship damaged.II. On the night of 22nd/23rd, U.S. positions on the Island of EspirituSanto, New Hebrides, were again bombarded.12. The loss of the U.S. Aircraft-Carrier Wasp, as a result of a U-boatattack in the South Pacific on September 15th, is announced.Anti-Submarine Operations.13. On the 21st H.M. Submarine Graph sank a U-boat N.E. of Finisterre.Apart from attacks carried out from the United States, 14 other attacks weremade, four of which probably damaged U-boats. Of the promising attacks, two were by aircraft in the Bay of Biscay, one by aircraft in the Mediterranean andone by H.M. Corvettes Geranium and Jonquil N.W. of the Canaries.   Of the
remaining ten, two attacks were made in the Arabian Sea and one in theMediterranean.A belated report has been received that H.M. Submarine Clyde probablytorpedoed a U-boat in the Eastern Mediterranean on the 10th.Enemy Intelligence.German.14.   Air reconnaissance on the 29th showed the Tirpitz.nX Trondheim.Italian.15. There has been a slight increase in the traffic from Italy to north africa.Japanese.16. Japanese heavy ships are in the main kept well to the north of theSolomons and of New Britain, out of range of land-based Allied aircraft.Two heavy cruisers, three light cruisers, one seaplane tender, approximately22 destroyers and patrol craft, three possible U-boats and seven merchant ships were reported in the Bnin-Shortlands area on the 23rd.- photographic reconnaissance of Rabaul on the same day showed one light cruiser, one seaplanetender, four destroyers, two small tankers, 26 merchant ships and 75 small vessels.Allied air attacks on shipping at Rabaul are described under Air Situation,paragraph 54.U-boats.17. There is considerable activity on the convoy routes in the North atlantic and near the Canaries. At least one U-boat is operating off East London. Thereis probably a large concentration of U-boats in the Azores area.Protection of Seaborne Trade.18. During the week ending the 25th/26th, 936 ships have been convoyed.Of these 209 were in ocean convoys and 727 in British coastal convoys. Oneanti-aircraft ship, 55 destroyers (including two U.S. destroyers) and 85 sloops,cutters and corvettes (including three U.S. cutters) were employed on escort duties. During the week 60 ships in three ocean convoys arrived in Home waters without loss, and one convoy, originally consisting of 39 ships, lost eight ships.19. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 24th totalled 607,000 tons compared with 684,000 tons during theprevious seven days,&quot; and an average of 699,000 tons for the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports 151,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.20. During the week 17 ships are reported to have been attacked, by U-boats,of which seven are known to have sunk.Two ships in an outward-bound convoy, and five ships, including two largeoil refinery ships, in a homeward-bound convoy were torpedoed in mid-Atlantic.Five ships in a homeward-bound convoy from Freetown were torpedoed west ofthe Canary Islands. Two ships were attacked off East London; one in the arabian Sea and one in the West Indies. The s.s. Empire Star (12,656 tons),outward-bound to Capetown with Avar stores, was torpedoed and sunk in theS.W. Approaches.A Swedish ship was mined and sunk off the south-west coast of Norway.British Minelaying.21. No minelaying operations were undertaken by surface craft during theweek. Aircraft laid mines in the Bay of Biscay, North Sea and Channel, and offthe Norwegian coast.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping. *22. No fresh minelaying was reported during the week. Eight magneticand two moored mines were destroyed in Home waters. One moored mine was destroyed off Iceland (C).Mine totals to date are : acoustic 1,329; magnetic 2,716; moored 1,757.Nine acoustic mines were destroyed in the Yugorski Strait, North Russia.H.M. Minesweeper&apos; Hazard was slightly damaged by a mine on the 24th.[24550] . B 2
Enemy Merchant Shipping.23. Three Turkish ships with a total tonnage of 5,723 have been charteredby the enemy for service in the Black Sea.24. Since the entry of Japan into the War. five German ships totalling32,656 tons, and three Italian ships of an aggregate tonnage of 17,880, havereached Biscay ports from the Far East. Another German ship, the Spreewald, of5.083 tons, was sunk by an Axis U-boat north of the Azores early this year.Between September-1941 and May 1942 six German ships, totalling 41,669 tons,have almost certainly proceeded to the Far East. Between May and August 1942no sailings took place, so far as is known, but since the 10th August seven shipsaggregating 53,000 tons have succeeded in leaving Biscay ports, in spite ofrepeated attacks by our aircraft. Some of these ships may be used as supply ships to raiders and U-boats. Activity in Biscay ports indicates further sailingsshortly.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.Northern and Central Sectors.25. The Russians have been attacking in some strength in the Bely area(north-north-east of Smolensk), but elsewhere fighting has been on a small scaleonly.Don Sector.26. The Russians continue their attempts to cross to the western bank ofthe Don. Apart from a slight extension of their bridgehead in the Yelansk areathey do not appear to have met with any success.Stalingrad Sector.. 27. The German attack on the northern part of Stalingrad has met strong-Russian resistance and has gained only little ground. Russian attacks againstthe German northern flank between the Don and the Volga appear to have abatedsomewhat, but latterly the Russians have increased their pressure south of stalingrad.Caticasus Sector.28. There has been little fighting in the Mozdok area, but west of the Terekbend German satellite forces have made an advance southwards. They have made some slight progress towards Tuapse both from the north-east and the north, butthe Russians are counter-attacking strongly.Summary.29. The Germans continue to direct their main effort against Stalingradand towards Tuapse, and also, in a lesser degree, in the Terek Sector. elsewhere the Russians have the initiative. Fighting has been hampered by autumn rains,though in South Russia the weather has lately improved. In the Northern and central Sectors, if normal weather conditions hold, operations should again be facilitated during the period of frost which is likely to intervene between thepresent rains and the snow of winter. At Stalingrad and in the Terek Sectoroperations are hardly likely to be affected by winter, except during periods ofintense cold and of fierce blizzards. In the hilly region north of Tuapse fighting-is not likely to be seriously hindered by winter conditions before December.Egypt.30. Other than patrol activity there was nothing of importance to reportup&quot; to the night 22nd/&apos;23rd. The concentration of 8th Army was completedwithout incident by dawn on the 23rd and the offensive commenced at 2200 hoursthat day after 20 minutes intensive artillery bombardment of the enemy positions.By 0530 hours on the 24th our troops attacking in the Northern Sector supportedby tanks had succeeded, in the main, in reaching their final objective. Duringthis period others of our armoured formations were moving forward behind theattacking troops and by 0630 hours a portion of them were starting to pass
through the gaps in the enemy minefields created by our initial advance. At1000 hours our line ran approximately from a point three and a half miles west of Tel el Eisa to a point four and a half miles S.W. of Tel el Eisa, thence to apoint five miles W.S.W. of Tel el Makh Khad and thence roughly S.E. passingsouth of Sanyet el Miteiriya to a point one mile S.E. of Deir el Dhib. Meanwhile,in the Central Sector of the front, our troops carried out raids in the RuweisatRidge area, and further south less important attacks achieved penetration of theenemy minefields in several places. Our troops in this Sector were delayed byhostile machine gun and anti-tank gun. positions sited in tb.e foremost enemyminefield. An enemy counter-attack early on the 24th compelled some of our troops in the extreme south to withdraw slightly.31. The following day in the extreme north an enemy counter-attack wasrepelled and our own troops mopped up isolated enemy resistance in their finalobjective. The passage of our armoured formations through the gaps made inthe most easterly enemy minefields, somewhat delayed by enemy air and artilleryaction, was eventually completed, but further minefields west of the originalobjectives of our attacking infantry have so far prevented unrestricted manoeuvreby our mobile armoured forces. An inconclusive minor engagement with Germantanks followed. In the Southern Sector one of our armoured formations whichattempted the passage of gaps made in the enemy minefield was held up by intensefire from German tanks, anti-tank guns and artillery..32. During the night 25th/26th, in the Northern Sector, our troopssuccessfully attacked enemy forces and captured an important position on thewest fringe of Tel el Eisa, inflicting considerable casualties on the Germans.Enemy resistance six miles west of Tel el Makh Khad had not yet been overcome by early morning of the 26th, but other localities in this area were in our hands and our patrols were active. During the afternoon of the 25th, about 100 enemytanks attacked our armoured forces, but the engagement was indecisive. Theenemy withdrew, leaving some of his tanks behind.In the Southern Sector, a successful attack was made on the Deir el Munassibfeature and enemy troops were harassed by artillery fire. Mopping up continuesand formations are reorganising.33. The threat of enemy counter-attacks- against our forward positions in the Northern Sector persisted until dusk on the 26th, but, as a resultof successful bombing of enemy concentrations, this attack did not develop andfurther progress by the enemy towards our positions during the night waschecked by defensive fire. Our troops carried out a successful attack during the night 26th/27th and captured Kidney Ridge, a small feature five miles west of Tel El Makh Khad. So far we have been unable to exploit any furtherwestwards.Another small advance was made in the Deir El Dhib area, and in theSouthern Sector enemy maps were captured which gave us valuable information.The clearing of the second enemy minefield in this area continued, despite enemyinterference.34. On the 27th enemy infantry and tanks attacked the extreme north ofour line, but were repulsed without difficulty. Meanwhile our bombers heavily attacked enemy armoured units south-west of Tel El Eisa which were forming upfor attack. This attack developed later in the afternoon, but was unsuccessful,and reports indicate that enemy losses were considerable.*35, On the 28th an enemy concentration with a large tank force was built up west of Kidney Ridge and carried out careful reconnaissance of our positions.This concentration was heavily bombed during the afternoon, and the expectedenemy counter-attack did not develop.36. During the night the 28th/29th our troops attacked northwards fromwest of Tel El Eisa. On the left they attained their objective, but the right metstiff opposition. Early on the 29th an enemy counter-attack on the north-east of this salient was driven off by our artillery fire.Madagascar.37. Our advance southwards has continued during the week, and by the evening of the 27th our troops were six miles north of Alakamisy. Road blocks,damaged bridges and sniping by the French forces have delayed our advance.
Burma.38. In Upper Burma. Maingkwan, 80 miles north-west of Myitkyina, hasbeen occupied by hostile Burmans after some resistance by local Kachins. Therehave been no further developments in the Chin Hills area, although unconfirmedreports state that the Japanese have been reinforced at Kalewa.In the Akyab area, small Japanese forces have started to push northwardstowards the Bengal frontier. Their advance is being opposed- by small detach-ments of our forward troops.South-West Pacific.39. In New Guinea the Australian forces are reported to be at Alola, fourmiles south of Kokoda. A small U.S. force operating to the south of the mainKokoda-Buna track has compelled the Japanese in that area to withdraw to apoint three miles south of the Wairopi Bridge (15 miles east of Kokoda).South Pacific Area.40. It is reported that U.S. forces at Guadalcanal (South-East Solomons)are being continuously engaged with strong Japanese forces, including tanks,and are holding their own.AIR SITUATION.General Review.41. Ports and industrial targets in Northern Italy were heavily attacked by home-based British bombers, with considerable success.Allied aircraft co-operated with our ground forces in Egypt: attacks were concentrated on enemy aerodromes and on enemy troops massing to counter-attack.Successful attacks were made on enemy convoys in the Mediterranean.Allied aircraft carried out destructive raids on shipping in the Pacific zone and attacked targets near Hong Kong.Japanese aircraft operated in some force against aerodromes in Assam.United Kingdom.42. Fighter Command flew 1,200 defensive sorties by day (including 10 by .S. aircraft) and 303 by night.Enemy activity against this country was again on a small scale; fifty-two aircrafts flew overland by day and ten by night. On the 26th about 20 Ju. 88stook advantage of low clouds and made individual attacks, mainly on south coastlocalities.Two enemy aircraft were shot down, two were probably destroyed and sixdamaged.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.43. Fighter, Bomber and Army Co-operation Commands despatched 388,77 and 20 offensive sorties respectively, compared with 610, 160 and 16 last week.In addition, 60 U.S. fighter sorties were flown, compared with 84 last week..A total of 56 tons of H.E. bombs were dropped during the week. Wellingtonsdropped over 50 tons of bombs during raids on industrial objectives inN.W. Germany and the Ruhr, including targets at Essen, Lingen and Krefeld.Mosquitos bombed the Stork Diesel-engine works at Hengelo (vide Appendix VII)and submarine slipways at Flensburg, where a 2,500-ton ship was left on fire.Low-level harassing attacks by Spitfires and by Mustangs of Army Co-operationCommand were made against rail-yards, locomotives, camps and other objectives in Northern France; many of these targets sustained damage and at least13 locomotives were hit.A number of fighter sweeps were flown but were uneventful.
A     4   C%Night.44. Twenty-one Intruder sorties were flown. Attacks were made on12 railway trains; a locomotive was derailed, the trucks of a train set on fire and many hits were made on other rolling-stock. Propaganda leaflets were released over Occupied France, 15 sorties being flown for this purpose. Otheroperations by Bomber Command are given in the next paragraph and under&quot;Coastal Operations.&quot;Italy.45. Home-based British bombers carried out three heavy raids at night andanother by day against Italian communications and war industries in the Genoa-Milan-Turin area. Totals of 245 tons of H.E. bombs and 327 tons of incendiaries were dropped.One hundred Lancasters delivered the first attack on Genoa in brightmoonlight and excellent visibility. The operation, involving a flight of over1,500 miles, was completed without loss. Genoa, besides being a powerful naval base much used for supplies to North Africa, houses the Ansaldo naval componentfactories together with aircraft, munition and locomotive works. Large, well-established fires were started in the town and clock area. The raid ranksamong Bomber Command&apos;s most effective attacks. On the following night,98 Halifaxes, Stirlings and Wellingtons bombed Genoa, Turin and Savona.Turin, a big railway and engineering centre, contains the Italian Royal Arsenal.Fiat aero-engines aud Lancia transport are made nearby. The. port of Savonahas iron and shipbuilding works. Weather at Genoa was less favourable thanon the previous night but gaps were found in the clouds; fires started in thethree towns were seen to take a good hold. Totals of 152 tons of H.E. bombs and192 tons of incendiaries were released during these two raids.For the first time in daylight, home-based bombers crossed the Alps to delivera highly successful attack on Milan, second largest city in Italy, where importantsteel works and aero-engine and magneto factories are situated. Seventy-threeLancasters dropped 46 tons of H.E. (including 12 x 4,000 lbs.) and 81 tonsof I.Bs. There was low cloud over the city and several crews attacked frombelow 4,000 ft. and a few from as low as 100 ft. A large number of bomb-bursts in the town and a notably large fire were seen (vide Appendix VII).A further force consisting of Halifaxes, Stirlings and Wellingtons began a nightattack on Milan before the last of the Lancasters had landed at its home base.Pathfinders operating with this force saw good fires from the afternoon&apos;s raid,but low cloud and haze covered the target and detailed identification was difficult.Several Halifaxes bombed from below the cloud haze. A total of 55 tons of bombswas released.From these four long-range operations, involving 393 sorties, eleven of our aircraft are missing and three crashed.Coastal Operations.46. Coastal Command despatched 411 sorties, of which 214 were on anti-U-boat operations and 87 on convoy escorts. Bomber Command despatched45 sorties on patrols west of the Bay of Biscay. (Results of Anti-U-boat operations are summarised under &quot; Naval Situation.&quot;) Aircraft operating under fighter command flew 481 sorties, including 46 by U.S. aircraft, on shipping protectionpatrols.Anti-shipping operations off the French, Belgian and Dutch coasts bySpitfires and by Mustangs of Army Co-operation Command involved a further112 sorties. Five armed trawlers, a tug, a 1,000-ton dredger and two ships,believed to be tankers, were damaged by cannon and machine-gun fire.A total of 123 aircraft of Bomber Command, of which four are missing, laid252 sea-mines in enemy waters.Mediterranean.Egypt and Libya.47. Allied aircraft flew 4,842 sorties, compared with 1,157 in the previousweek. A general offensive by the 8th Army commenced on the nio-ht of the23rd/24th October.
Prior to the opening of the offensive a heavy-scale attack was maintainedday and night on enemy advanced landing grounds at Fuka, El Daba, andQotaifiya. At night, the bombing was carried out by Wellingtons and Bostons,assisted by naval Albacores carrying flares. In daylight, light bombers (includingU.S. Mitchells) and fighter-bombers, escorted by fighters, continued the attacks.Bombs burst among dispersed aircraft, some of which received direct hits, and anumberof fires were started.Offensive patrols were maintained over the forward area, escorted fighter-bombers attacked enemy M.T. and military targets in the battle area, and eightBeaufighters flew an offensive reconnaissance along the coastal road to Sollum. Inthis raid a tractor, a heavy gun and six vehicles were destroyed and 43 othervehicles were damaged, in addition to which two camps and a W/T station were shot up.Enemy activity was confined to a defensive role. Seventeen enemy aircraft were shot down and 13 of our aircraft are missing or destroyed.On the night of the 23rd/24th. Wellingtons, assisted by naval Albacores,concentrated their attacks on enemy gun positions and M.T.. and dropped over130 tons of IT.E. bombs and 41 containers of fragmentation bombs with good effect. Hurricanes machine-gunned enemy ground targets between El Alameinand Fuka, and destroyed four ammunition lorries and hit 25 M/T vehicles, aM/T repair shop and a small dump. Bostons laid smoke screens in front of ouradvancing troops. On the day following, our main bomber effort was directed against enemy M/T near gaps in the enemy minefields, and fourteen attacks were carried out. Fighter bombers attacked M/T with good results in the northern and southern sectors. Eight bombers made two attacks on El Daba landing ground, and special Hurricanes obtained hits on 18 tanks on El Taga Plateau,eight of which were probably destroyed. During this 24-hour period a recordfigure of over 1,000 sorties were flown.On the subsequent days, in operations overland our main bomber effort was directed against M.T. and enemy forces in the Northern Sector to prevent theenemy concentrating for counter-attacks;, the effectiveness of the bombing was confirmed by our ground forces. Fighter-bombers and special Hurricanes also made harassing attacks on M.T. in the battle area, and a number of petrol lorries,tanks, and other vehicles were destroyed.Escorted light bombers and fighter-bombers maintained their raids on enemy aerodromes, while fighter offensive patrols were flown over the battle area and enemy forward landing grounds. Enemy activity increased somewhat duringthe week, but our fighters maintained control of the situation. In the course ofthese offensive patrols and attacks on enemy aerodromes, fighters destroyed43 enemy aircraft (including 15 by U.S. war hawks) and probably destroyed over20 others for the loss of 15 fighters.An offensive patrol of Beaufighters, between Crete and Cyrenaica, inter-cepted 33 Ju. 52s escorted by six Me. 110s. Four Ju. 52s were shot down and two others damaged; one Beaufighter is missing.At night Wellingtons and Hurricanes attacked M.T. and other military targets in the battle area, resulting in many fires. Intruder patrols were main-tained over enemy landing grounds.The success of our air attacks on the enemy air force appears to have been confirmed by their relatively small effort in reply to our attacks and the continueddefensive nature of their operations. The employment of Ju. 87s for dawn anddusk attacks,&apos; and even by night, seems to indicate that adequate protection couldnot be provided for their aircraft by day. - .Malta.48. In the week ending the 26th our aircraft flew 419 sorties against 1,005by the enemy; these totals compare with 873 and 1,834 respectively during theprevious week.Enemy attacks were carried out by formations of from 20 to 40 fighters, and fighter-bombers. In most instances these raids were intercepted by Spitfires wellnorth of the Island, and frequently the bombers were made to jettison their bombs in the sea. As the enemy frequently had the advantage of height, some combatswere inconclusive.Takali and Luqa aerodromes were cratered, but little material damage was caused. One Wellington was destroyed on the ground and four fighters were damaged.Sixteen enemy aircraft were shot down (four by A.A. fire), five were probably destroyed and thirteen damaged.  Three Spitfires are missing.
Sea Communications.49. A small ship and a destroyer were attacked by Beaufighters off Tobruk,and both were set on fire. Four fighters which were escorting the ships were destroyed.A southbound convoy consisting of one tanker, one large and one small ship,and escorted by four destroyers, was attacked by Wellingtons north of Tobruk,and the tanker was straddled. A later attack was carried out by 33 heavy U.S.bombers, who claimed two hits on the tanker. The tanker was subsequently hitfive times by Beaufighters and Blenheims and left ablaze; near misses were madeon the small ship. Wellingtons attacked at dusk and obtained six hits on thelarge ship, followed by a violent explosion. During this operation we lost eightaircraft, and two enemy aircraft were shot down and eight others damaged.A tanker and a ship each of 5,000 tons were attacked off the West Coast of greece by two Wellingtons from Malta.   Both vessels were probably sunk.U.S. Liberators obtained a direct hit on a ship in Navarino Bay.Crete.50. During the week three night attacks were made on Maleme Aerodromeby heavy bombers. Many good fires were started, some of which were probablyburning aircraft.  Two bombers are missing.Russian Front.51. The Air Force of the Russian Baltic Fleet were active over the gulf of Finland, where a collier, a patrol boat and two transports totalling 12,000 tons were reported to be sunk. Three low-level attacks were made on a Germanaerodrome and 20 German bombers were destroyed.The Russians claim that in air action against an attempted landing on an island off the southern shore of Lake Ladoga, 15 German aircraft were shot downand 16 naval vessels carrying troops were destroyed.On the Stalingrad front the weather was very bad during the earlier partof the week. The Russians state that on one day Stormoviks and bombers were operating in strength against enemy defences and ground forces.The main German effort at Stalingrad was directed against communications and supply depots, and also occasionally on Russian artillery positions on islands in the Volga and on the east bank of the river.During the week ending the 24th October, the Russians claim to have destroyed 114 German aircraft against 51.of their own.India and Burma.52. Small forces of Blenheims successfully bombed Rathedaung, Buthe-daung, Maungdaw and Prome and single Blenheims attacked a number ofBurmese villages in enemy occupation.Twenty-nine Japanese fighters carried out a machine-gun attack on the aerodrome at Chittagong (Bengal); a Blenheim was destroyed on the ground,otherwise damage was slight. Two attacks were made by a total of 95 Japanesebombers and fighters on the aerodromes at Din j an and Chabua (Assam).Bombing was ineffective, but enemy fighters destroyed a number of U.S. aircraft on the ground. It is reported that one or more raiders were shot down by .S. fighters and that three more were destroyed by A.A: gunfire.China Zone.53. On the 21st, U.S. bombers raided the Kailan coal mines near Tientsin,involving a round flight of 2,000 miles. Pilots&apos; first reports claim hits on thepower house, the transformer plant and the main pit-head shaft. photographs show bursts on or near the plant which is one of the main Japanese sources ofcoal.Power installations near Hong Kong and shipping at Kowloon docks were bombed by U.S. Mitchells. It is reported that the power station was destroyed and that warehouses and shipping were hit. After bombing, the U.S. forma-tion was intercepted by 18 Japanese fighters, of which 10 were destroyed and five damaged. Later in the day, six TJ.S. fighters intercepted 20 enemy fightersapproaching Kunming; three enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat and fourprobably destroyed. Two U.S. aircraft did not return from the raid on HongKong. The following day, White Cloud Aerodrome (north-east of Canton) was attacked.[24550]c
Pacific Zone.Solomon, Islands and Bismarck Archipelago.54. U.S. aircraft successfully attacked a number of enemy ships in theSolomons area (vide Naval Situation). Japanese aircraft, of which at leasttwenty are claimed to have been destroyed, made numerous attacks onGuadalcanal aerodrome. Catalinas, in a night attack on Buka aerodrome,damaged an enemy bomber on the ground and left several large fires which were probably fuel and ammunition dumps.In continued support of the operations in the Solomons, concentrations ofshipping at Rabaul (New Britain) were heavily bombed by Fortresses betweenthe 22nd and 28th. One cruiser, one destroyer, one gunboat and two ships are believed to have been sunk in low-level attacks and more than six ships were damaged, one seriously. Three other ships were set on fire and may have been destroyed and a tanker was hit.Kavieng aerodrome (New Ireland) was attacked by Catalinas: fuel dumpswere hit, large fires were started and a bomber was destroyed on the ground.New Guinea.55. Two enemy bombers were destroyed and two others damaged during anattack on Lae aerodrome. Destructive attacks with bombs and machine-gun firewere maintained on enemy positions in the Kokoda-Wairopi area.Japanese raids on aerodromes near Port Moresby were ineffective.Australia and Timor.56. Small waves of enemy aircraft raided aerodromes near Darwin on three occasions; the resultant damage was slight. An attack was also made in theMilne Bay area, with negligible results.Hudsons started fires in a stores dump on Koepang aerodrome (Timor).Dilli Was also attacked and buildings were destroyed in the Tobisse area.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.57. There has been no concentrated bombing. On four out of the five dayson which attacks were made, bombing was mainly confined to the south and south-west coastal areas; on the remaining day (the 26th) incidents were reported from23 inland and coastal towns, extending from the South-West to the HomeCounties and East Anglia. The only raid of the week during the hours ofdarkness (the 24th/25th) was confined to areas of the East Coast.Damage.58. There has been no damage of national importance. Incidents involvingcasualties and damage took place as follows : On the 22nd at Orford and Deal.During the night the 24th/25th at Hull, Skegness and Grantham. (AtGrantham 500 people were rendered homeless.)On the 25th at Torquay, where an R.A.F. hospital was hit causing15 fatal and 36 serious Service casualties.On the 26th at H.M.

The above table is an aggregation of the material in the employment tables of non-tankers and tankers in Statistical Digests E and F respectively. in combining the figures for non-tankers with those for tankers, certain slight differences have had to be brought into a common form. The figures for non-tankers relateto the last day of the month while those for tankers relate to the 15th of the month to February 1942 and to the last day of the month from Marc!) 1942.(1) (a) Tankers on Admiralty service include vessels importing oil fuel to the United Kingdom; in September 1942 these comprised 39 tankers of 329,000 gross ions.(6) Non-tankers allocated to the fighting services which are under repair are excluded from this column.   All tankers on Admiralty service are, however,- included,(c) A substantial part (in recent months nearly one-half) of the tonnage in these columns brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage (see note (3))., (2) These columns give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair. They do not,therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward voyages to the Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries other than United Kingdom and Eire

APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week : Germany.Hochst. During the attack on the 8th/9th September the I.G. Farbenchemical works w-ere hit and five buildings in the western part of the works (not covered in photographic sorties) were destroyed. Three of these buildingsproduced benzylchloride, chlorsulphonic acid and pyridine respectively, and theother two were large laboratories.Italy.Milan.The Popolo if Italia states that 30 major fires and 300 minor fires resulted from the daylight attack.Occupied France.Le Creusot. Photographic cover obtained on the 22nd, after the attack onthe 17th October, is incomplete, but an immediate interpretation discloses thefollowing major damage : (a) Le Creusot Processing Works.&apos; (Southern half only covered.) The southend of the locomotive machine shop has been destroyed, and there issevere damage to part of the cold bending and finishing shop. A four-bay shed and others adjoining the main turbine building shop are completely demolished, many other buildings are partly destroyed or damaged by blast and there are signs of damage to railway lines.(b) Breuil Steelworks. Three direct hits, two of them on the generalmachine shops, have caused partial collapse of the framework of thebuildings and severe blast damage to the roofs. A warehouse is half destroyed and another severely damaged by blast.(c) Le Crettsot Steelworks. (Central part only covered.)   There is serious damage to one large and two or three smaller buildings.It is reported that the raid was most successful and caused a complete stoppage of work.Photographs show the following results of recent attacks by U..S. aircraft: L%rient j Keroman. The submarine pens here were attacked on the21st August by Fortresses, and a considerable concentration of bombs directly onthe target is evident. There were many bursts on the northern part of theincomplete block of shelters, between the central block of shelters and the southernincomplete block of shelters, and about the shelter entrance. A large buildingbetween the central block of shelters and the Long Basin has suffered at least two direct hits, and there,are many bursts on and about the adjacent buildings.Many bursts are evident near a 750-ton U-boat and among three floating docks,two of which were apparently hit.Lille. A more complete examination of photographs taken following the attack on the Cie. de Fives-Lille Steel and Engineering Works, shows that themain steel boiler works shop (1,030 feet by 130 feet) has had at least three direct hits, a building used as general store (360 feet by 40 feet) has been almost completely demolished, and a number of neighbouring workshops have been affectedby blast. Other bombs appear to have fallen in the centre and towards the northend of this part of the factory affecting particularly the tool shops, pipe shop,welding shop and assembly shops. In these latter shops about 180,000 square feet of roofing has been severely damaged.
Courtraij Wevelghem. This target was attacked by a single Fortress on the2nd October. A large shed on the south side of the aerodrome and a smalladjacent building have been demolished. This shed was damaged at one endduring the raid by U.S. aircraft on the 29th August and at the time of the second attack was being re-roofed.Rouen I Sotteville. Recent photographs of this area show that, in additionto previously reported damage caused on the 17th August by Fortresses, the roofof a factory building (230 ft. by 180 ft.) was seriously scorched by fire and anadjacent factory building was damaged.Occupied Belgium.General. The effectiveness of machine-gun attacks on railwav engines is illustrated by a report that on the 28th July there were seven engines at a stationnear Dixmude (between Dunkirk and Bruges) out of action. The boilers werepierced from one side to the other and repairs were expected to take several weeks.Sea-Mining.On the 20th September a U-boat and a large merchant ship were sunk inDanzig Bay.On the same day a large merchant ship of the Wilhelmsen Line was seen tohave sunk off Swinemunde, her funnel being awash.In the second week of October a U-boat struck a magnetic mine off Lorientand sank immediately.The Vichy wireless has announced that the tug Les Baleineau-x of 180 tons was mined and sank on the 13th October off La Pallice.It is learnt that, by the end of September, in view of the danger from mines,Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and German ships intending to pass into the Balticthrough the Oresund had for some days ceased to navigate at night. Theyanchored and only proceeded in daylight.
