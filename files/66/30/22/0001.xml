THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1942.SECRET Copy No.W.P. (42) 492.October 26, 1942.WAR CABINET.Mr. RICHARD LAWS VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith a report by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on a visit which he paid to America atthe end of August.A. E.Foreign Office, October 26, 1942.ANNEX.DURING my stay in Washington and New York I had talks, generally atsome length, with thirty or forty people in the Administration or prominent in political life outside of it. I had long talks with&quot; Mr. Cordell Hull, Mr. sumner welles, Mr. Adolf Berle and others in the State Department; with the Vice-President and Mr. Milo Perkins; with Mr. Norman Davis, Mr. Lippmann,Mr. Louchlin Currie, Mr. Taussig of the Anglo-American Caribbean Commission,Mr. Phillip Murray of the C. 1.0., Mr. Green of the A.F. of L., Mr. Morgenthau,Mr. Elmer Davis, Mr. Felix Frankfurter, Mr. Stettinius, Mr. Eugene Meyer,Mr. Henry Luce and many others.2. From so many people, talking so much an.d so rapidly, I derived a variety of impressions, somewhat confused but still capable of analysis. It is very easy to understand how it is that there is very little settled policy in the Administra-tion. So many eager and expressive minds are so very active. Each man has hisown policy and has no hesitation in stating it. But each man knows that his isnot the policy of the United States. That will come, at the appointed time, fromthe White House. It is difficult to know how much importance to attach toexpressions of view, even from highly responsible quarters. Nevertheless, I amfairly certain that a good deal of what I heard did in fact represent the presentview of the President or, at least, that it represented ideas which he wished tosee canvassed.3. In a sense, therefore, policy is being formed, even in the chaos of war-timeWashington. And amidst all the diversity of view, and over-riding it, thei*e is a clear-running vein of common purpose. Mr. Hull and Mr. Wallace, for example,did not seem to me to be nearly so far apart in their objectives, at any rate, as Ihad supposed. Nor, I fancy, are they nearly so far apart as each suspects.Policy is being formed, even though, in the end, it is the White House whichwill state the future policy of the United States. And public opinion will dictateto the White House. But I find it difficult to believe that so many highlyintelligent men, so vigorous and so confident, are not capable- of exertingconsiderable influence upon public opinion if, indeed, they are not alreadyexpressing it.4.   I found in Washington, to a degree far greater than I had expected,dissatisfaction with and criticism of the war effort.   It is said that there is too much authority in the hands of one man who is unable to devolve it; that agencies and committees are substituted for decisions; that initiative is throttled with11884   [24541]      . b
red tape; that the general public is altogether remote from the realities of war,and so on. I found, too, a good deal of criticism of the President. I am notreferring to those business circles which have always been so violently opposedto his social policies. But a number of people whom I have hitherto regarded asbeing among his staunchest supporters are beginning to wonder whether he is anything more than a fool of genius, with an extraordinary nose for public opinion.A fairly intelligent newspaperman gave me the sardonic advice that I should visitHollywood, for, he said, no one who does not understand Hollywood can possiblyunderstand contemporary Washington. He went on to explain that the Adminis-tration was already spending 830 million annually on public relations. It struckme that this kind of feeling, that the President is far more interested in effectsthan in results, and that he has become incapable of dealing honestly with hisown people, is gaining ground. It is not a factor of great importance as yet, butif it persists it may become of great importance. In the meantime, and among those elements which, without being in any sense reactionary, are distrustfulof the Presidents integrity, the figure of Mr. Cordell Hull looms large and leanand&apos; reassuring.5. There is a great deal of criticism and self-disparagement so far as thewar is concerned of self-abasement even. But alongside of all this there is theevident conviction, disturbed by no inner questionings whatever, that the UnitedStates stands for something in the world something of which the world hasneed, something which the world is going to like, something, in the final analysis,which the world is going to take whether it likes it or not. It struck me forciblythat America, at long last, had passed through the stage of adolescence. Goneare those inner doubts and hesitancies. Gone is that pathetic desire for approval.The prevailing attitude of mind is one of &quot; I&apos;m telling you.&quot; And it is themore impressive because it is so quiet, so unassertive; in short, so un-American.It is implied rather than stated. Conversely, I had a curious &quot;through thelooking-glass &apos;&apos; kind of an impression that Americans are beginning to regardus as we &quot;have been accustomed to regard them, as a people essentially amiable,but touchy, truculent and difficult, striving to cover up an inner lack of confidencewith a cloak of unnatural assertiveness.6. All this is interesting and exhilarating. It is also rather alarming.There is. of course, very great over-simplification. Washington sees worldproblems through a telescope where we look at them through a microscope.Washington is thinking in terms of centuries and continents when we arethinking of question-time next Wednesday and the Free Austrian movement. Itis easy to understand what critics of the Administration mean when they speak of &quot; the lunatic fringe &quot; at Washington. For these people are not men of theworld.   They are children, playing with bricks and &quot;making the world over.&quot;7. It is not this, however, which should alarm us. Perspectives, after all, are subject to correction, and it may well be that the true perspective liessomewhere between our own and the American. And if they are not men ofthe world it may not be so very important after all. Men of the world havemade our world, and we are familiar with their handiwork. The real danger is twofold. First, there is the danger that we will resent their enthusiasm, orcontent ourselves with smiling gently at their over-simplifications. The seconddanger is consequential upon the first. It is that through lack of guidance theywill run their heads against so many, and so hard, brick walls that there willbe utter disillusionment. I think that they are not unwilling to be guided,but guidance will demand of us a degree of understanding which it may wellbe beyond our power to give. It is important, too, that Americans shouldunderstand us. I am certain that they will not understand us unless, first, weunderstand them.8. In particular it will be necessary, I think, for us to realise that wecannot have it both ways. We cannot have a confident and assured United States,looking outwards, eager to assume responsibility and eager to help, and, at thesame time, a United States without a mind of its own, ready to accept ourleadership and to follow meekly in our paths. We can only work with the americans upon a basis of partnership. And we must realise that, on paper,we shall not appear as the senior partner. That position must go to theUnited States by virtue of their resources and their population. We, for our part, can hope to redress the balance and more-by virtue of our experience.and our greater political sagacity.9. In what light do the Americans regard us? I am satisfied that, with two or three exceptions, all the men I spoke to are convinced that Anglo-
American co-operation is essential for a complete solution of the problems of reconstruction. I am satisfied, too, that very few cf them are hopeful thatthis co-operation will be forthcoming from us and I have no doubt that atthe back of their minds they are preparing a partial solution. This, if it comes,will be based upon the ideas of &quot; America First &quot; and will be satisfactoryneither to us nor to them. I do not think that they want a solution of thiskind but they have a lurking fear that they may be driven back to it. The mostnotable of the exceptions that I have mentioned are Mr. Lauchlin Currie andMr. Ray Atherton. The former is violently anti-British but this emotion is notbased fundamentally upon hatred of Britain. It is founded, far more, upon apassionate, spiteful and feminine kind of liberalism. Mr. Currie is an american (and a more influential) Kingsley Martin if one can imagine aKingsley Martin whose office is not in Bloomsbury but in a room adjoining theCabinet Room at No. 10. I do not think that Mr. Ray Atherton is anti-British,but he has some kind of a chip on his shoulder. It may be that his careerhas had a set-back. It may be that his long sojourn in London has given himan exaggerated contempt for the over-simplifications of his colleagues. but whatever the reason, he filled me up with warnings against taking too seriouslyanything that I might hear. He warned me, too, against any attempt on our part to extract from the Administration binding commitments of any kindwhatever.   On this point, at any rate, I am sure he is right.10. I should add, perhaps, that very much to my surprise Mr. FelixFrankfurter, too, sang in a minor key. He professed the greatest scepticism asto the prospects of the United States undertaking any responsibility in Europe or,indeed, anywhere else in the world outside the Western Hemisphere. I was left,however, with the strong impression that Mr. Frankfurter was disgruntled. Ithad evidently been made clear to him that it would be convenient if he were ableto absent himself from Washington during those periods when the SupremeCourt was not in session. His enjoyment of his country retreat was thereforesomewhat qualified by a feeling that Washington, without him, was probably onthe wrong lines altogether.11. I will deal later with the doubts and suspicions of our intentions sogenerally entertained in official circles. These, to my mind, are far moreimportant than any surface currents of anti-British feeling of which one hearsfrom time to time. They are more important because they exist in the minds ofthose who are in power and who, from the standpoint of their own policies, would very much sooner have them exorcised. They are important, too, because it is atleast possible to exorcise them. But equally important is the quite clear recog-nition of the fact that Britain and the United States have got to work together if anything better than a bad second best is to be achieved.12. This takes different shape in different minds. Mr. Finletter, a new york Corporation lawyer, who is serving as head of a department in the state department, believes that the American people would welcome a straightforwardalliance with England, not so much, because they are fond of the British asbecause they are tired of humbug. Mr. Adolf Berle, who makes no secret of hisdistrust of Britain, yet maintains that the two countries must work together, since they have a common goal. This goal Mr. Berle defines as &quot; The Good Life.Moderation. The development of the individual personality with a consciousnessof his responsibility towards society.&quot; But Mr. Berle goes on to say that Anglo-American co-operation must be wrapped up in a United Nations cloak. For, he says, the elements in American life which are most pro-British are not thosewhich support the kind of things for which Britain stands. Their interest inGreat Britain is not so strong as their interest in themselves or their oppositionto the Administration. Too plain an insistence upon Anglo-American co-opera-tion would rally the quite worthless support of those pro-British elements (quiteworthless because as soon as their own special interests were at stake they wouldrat), and antagonise the rest of the population to a degree that would makeco-operation impossible. Mr. Sumner Welles, on the other hand, does not believethat there would be any antagonism to Anglo-American co-operation as such, but expressed a variation of the same idea when he said that the real difficulty wasthat the American people would not willingly tax themselves for a hundred years in order to maintain the British Empire.13. There are those, like Mr. MacLeish, who are passionate friends of GreatBritain, or, like Mr, Walter Millis of the New York Herald Tribtme, who are anxious to find a basis for friendship, but perhaps a little doubtful of the possi-[24541] b 2
bility. There are others, like Mr. Wallace Murray of the State Department,whose anti-British feeling is based, I believe, primarily upon the conviction thatwe are effete and lacking in moral fibre and ready, ourselves, to abandon ourdestiny. This feeling of doubt, not so much of our intentions as of our guts, is avery important element in Anglo-American relations; and, as I will endeavour toshow later, I do not think that doubts of this kind can be removed merely by astubborn refusal to explain or to complain. And then there is Mr. Cordell Hull.I am inclined to think that Mr. Hull is more genuinely in sympathy with thiscountry than anyone else in the Administration. Mr. Hull is a traditionalist,who no longer believes in fairies, or that the moon is made of green cheese. Hehas, I would judge, a genuine respect for our experience and our traditions. Heis a man of the highest integrity as well as being (with all his crotchets) far moreinfluential than is generally supposed in London; and he would always work withand for us unless, by so doing, he would prejudice the interests (and he wouldtake a long-sighted view of what those interests were) of his own country. Byand large, I am certain that the majority of those with whom I talked aregenuinely determined to work with this country if it is at all possible; and the others would be very willing to do. so if they believed, as they do not now believe,that a basis for co-operation could be found.14. I was warned, when I reached Washington, that I would find far too much emphasis upon the economic aspects of reconstruction and far too littleupon the military and political aspects. In particular, I would find that therewas no understanding of &quot; the German problem.&quot; I do not think that thi?warning was justified.15. There is certainly an emphasis upon the economics of reconstruction.This is&apos;natural, for every American is aware of the extreme vulnerability of american industrial economy; and realises, too, that we and other countries are equally vulnerable. Failure to solve the economic problem will lead to economicwar, and economic war, if it does not lead to physical war, will certainly lead tosome other form of social disintegration. But the Americans realise that mandoes not live by bread alone; they would only affirm that bread, too, has its place.This is not to say, however, that they disregard political considerations or thatthey pin their hopes to the Economic Man.16. Still less do they disregard Germany. Mr. Sumner Welles, for example,gleams and glitters with icy displeasure (like a glacier caught in a sudden shaftof light) if it is suggested to him that his long armistice is a device to lessen the pressure upon Germany. He states emphatically that Germany will have to be occupied &quot; for five, ten or twenty-five years,&quot; and he appears confident that theUnited States will support and contribute to such an occupation.17. I did not find in the State Department (or, indeed, outside of it) anydisposition to underestimate the importance of political frontiers, for instance.There was no suggestion that the nationalist spirit could be expunged from theslate merely because it was inconvenient. On the contrary, there is, in some respects, an undue emphasis upon the value as well as the importance ofnationalism; this emphasis markedly influences their thinking upon the Far East.As far as I could judge of current opinion in Washington, the economic andpolitical aspects of reconstruction are thought of as parallel but interdependentstructures. They would say that no political settlement would be lasting unless there were both economic and military support for it. They would say, also, that economic reconstruction would be quite impossible unless regard was had to political realities, and unless there was, in addition, military security. But, theywould add, given this triple base, political, military and economic, and givensufficient and sufficiently enduring determination upon the part of the victoriousdemocracies to enforce their will, purely political considerations would loom lesslarge in men&apos;s minds and the degree of military force required to ensure securitywould progressively diminish. By an adaptation of Marxian theory the old-world would wither away and be succeeded, over the generations, by a new world in which purely political questions like frontiers would no longer be an obsession.Their line of thought on Germany is similar. Germany must be held in check by force, perhaps for years, perhaps for generations; but eventually Germany&apos;sneurosis, too, would be cured and Germany take her place in western civilisation.18. I have reported elsewhere talks that I had with Mr. Cordell Hull andMr. Sumner Wells. I had, too, a series of long talks witih Mr. Adolf Berle.Mr. Berie is a complex and baffling character. I met no one, either British ar american, who liked or trusted him.   &quot; His inner faithlessness is absolute and
unqualified/&apos; one of his colleagues in the State Department said to me. Anothereminent American said : &quot; He is the most evil man I have ever known.&quot; but mr. Berle&apos;s influence is admittedly very great. Without friends and withoutparty, he probably relies upon his association with the President, which is saidto be close, and upon his intellectual gifts, which are remarkable. He is generallysupposed to be anti-British. And so he is, although, as I have already indicated,he seems to place a certain value upon Britain. But he is also, I think, anti-American. In short, he is a misanthrope and a misfit with a lively interest inthe Oxford Movement, and, it is said, about to be received into the catholic church.19. To talk with Mr. Berle is a curious experience. He is a small, slightman who bends low over his desk as he talks. It is like having a conversationwith a pocket compass. He looks up at you, and his eyes wander, in a graduallydiminishing arc, from one shoulder to another until finally they come to rest,for a brief second, on your own. And then, as it were, the compass is joltedagain and &quot;the eyes again begin to wander. It is difficult to know just what herepresents. My impression is that he does not reflect the conclusions of theState Department, but that he does reflect current trends of thought. Mr. Berlehas a mind like quicksilver. He does not draw up blueprints. He thinks inblueprints. He seizes upon an idea and in an instant the idea, with all its implications, appears fully formed in his mind, complete and symmetrical,, andis expressed, the whole picture, in easy and logical speech. His conceptions are obviously far too symmetrical to represent any settled policy. It is a fact, too,that his ideas are constantly changing the whole picture, frame and all.Nevertheless, his views, as he expressed them to me, seemed a reflection far tidierand more orderly than the original image of so much that I heard in washington, that I think they are worth recording.20. It was impossible, said Mr. Berle, to compare conditions as they wouldbe when this war was over with the state of Europe in 1919 or 1920. We must look forward to a long period of absolute chaos during which American andBritish forces would have to police Europe. It was clear, however, that therewould be certain questions, frontiers for example, which would have to be settled at once. Versailles had been much maligned, and the territorial arrangements of Versailles were a good deal sounder than was generally allowed. So far asWestern Europe was concerned the frontiers of 1919 ought to stand.21. Germany would have to be partitioned possibly into three States thesouthern States including Austria, and an Eastern and a Western Germany,divided by the Oder. (Here Mr. Berle was clearly speaking beyond his brief.Mr. Norman Davis, who is very much in Mr. hull&apos;s  confidence in these matters,said that they had been considering the partition of Germany but had reluctantlycome to the conclusion that it was not a solution.) In Eastern Europe there ought to be a single federation, reaching from the Baltic to the mediterranean and the Black Sea. It might be that a State like Yugoslavia would be broken up, with each of its components a constituent member of the federation. Mr.Berleadmitted that this idea of an all inclusive federation might be an impossibility,but, he said, an impossible problem might require an impossible solution. Somesolution at any rate, would have to be found. There was Russia to consider asweir as Germany. Eastern Europe must be made strong as a counterpoise toRussia. These questions of frontiers would have to be settled, but we must learnto think of frontiers in a new way. A frontier was no longer a fixed andimpenetrable wall, reaching from deep down in the earth to high up in theheavens. Every nation had half a dozen different frontiers. There was thepolitical frontier proper. There was an economic frontier which might differ from the political frontier. There was the military frontier which might differagain; and so on.22. There were other questions, Mr. Berle went on, apart from politicaland military questions. There were those in Washington who thought that the-whole world could be planned and regulated. &quot; A world like that,&quot; saidMr. Berle, &quot; would need gods to run it. I don&apos;t know how it is with you, but here in Washington there s quite a bottle-neck in archangels.&quot; In the economic sphere there were three major problems : There was the balance of payments.There was the problem of communications. There were commodity prices. Theyhad done a lot of work on the first, and the solution would be some kind of inter-national bank, in which the United States would take a participation of 6 or[24541] &apos; &apos;       b 3
7 billion dollars. From the internal political point of view, this was a relativelysimple thing to put across, for the subscription of capital could be carried throughat a single stroke and before any reaction had set in.23. The problem of communications would be a very serious one after thewar. It was necessary, if the economic structure of Europe was to be satisfac-satisfactorily developed, to unify the railway system gauges, trucks, rates and so on and this would require strict measures of international control. Shipping was another headache. The war would end with the greater part of the world&quot;sshipping in the hands of the United States. That shipping could not be left tothe undivided control of United States interests. Here, again, some measure ofinternational control would be necessary. Finally, there was the question of civilaviation. Mr. Berle had grown very tired of the situation in Africa and theMiddle East. Pan-air had been trying to use the exigencies of war to securecommercial advantages after the war. B.O.A.C. had been childish in itsattempts to protect itself. This situation could not be allowed to develop againafter the war, but it would not be difficult, nor would it require any very elaborateorganisation, to keep it under control. As to commodity prices, that was a problem which, Mr. Berle thought-, they were just about ready to tackle.24. Nearly all those with whom I talked, notably Mr. Hull, Mr. Welles andMr. Berle, seemed to be convinced that some form of international policing wasnecessary and that the United States could be relied upon to participate. Inthis connexion, however, it is interesting to recall some views expressed byMr. Herbert Agar and others at dinner one night. They said that the anti-British feeling in the training camps was beyond belief. On the following day was talking to Mr. McCloy, Assistant Secretary for War, and I mentioned this to him. - He confirmed what Mr. Agar had said, and expanded it. This anti-British feeling, he said, was being deliberately inculcated by certain higherofficers, notably General Somervell. Throughout the Higher Command of thearmy anti-British feeling was intense. There was violent jealousy of the PrimeMinister, who was regarded as dominating and bamboozling the President. TheJoint Chiefs of Staff organisation was a pure cypher, and the American sidewere about as friendly to the British as they would be to the German GeneralStaff if they sat round a table with them. Mr. McCloy was trying to bring thesituation under control but it does not seem a happy augury for future jointpolicing arrangements.25. The attitude of mind described by Mr. McCloy is, of course, highlydisturbing. It is, however, confined to the professional soldiery, and the Adminis-tration as a whole are not influenced by it, and would like to be rid of it. It is all the more important, therefore, that we should have the confidence of theAdministration so that they will be able to support us against their professionalswithout feeling at the back of their minds that in the end we will let them down.This is important now, in relation to the soldiers. It will be equally importantwhen the war is over and when the military caste has been supplanted by business interests.26. As I have said, politics and economics are regarded as parallel butinterdependent structures. There is, or so it seemed to me, a very general measureof agreement upon the political picture. And there is far less disagreement than   had anticipated in the economic field. Mr. Hull and Mr. Welles, it is true, areinclined to regard Mr. Wallace as an inexperienced visionary who has clamberedon to the band-waggon of reconstruction. Similarly Mr. Wallace and Mr. MiloPerkins regard Messrs. Hull and Welles as indolent cowards who refuse to facefacts, or who, having faced the facts, refuse to state them. But this, I think,on both sides was an expression of professional jealousy rather than of anyfundamental divergence of view.27. The differences between the two sides, it seemed to me, are far more amatter of emphasis than of principle. I asked Mr. Flawkins, who advisesMr. Hull on trade agreements, whether it was the Secretary&apos;s view that suchelimination of trade barriers as could be achieved would of itself suffice to getinternational trade going again. Mr. Hawkins returned an emphatic negative.There must be positive action as well. Mr. Hull thought, however, that nocurrency devices, no schemes for the expansion of trade, would be of avail unless they were based upon a relatively free world economy. There were plenty of people to emphasise the need for positive measures and all too few to stress the underlying need for a free economy. Mr. Hull kept harping upon the &apos;&apos; Hullpolicies&quot; far more because he wanted to draw attention to facts that were
generally forgotten than because he believed he had found a panacea. Mr. Hullhimself said to me that some measure of economic planning would be necessary.28. Mr. Milo Perkins, on his side, admits the need for the maximum freedomof trade. But the objective could never be reached by a frontal attack; people were too selfish, management and labour alike. Selfishness, which was naturaland not discreditable, could not be carried by assault. It could only be outflanked.He would outflank it, in the United States, by taxing Americans to flood theworld with capital goods. And he would not expect a return for a generationor longer and then not as a matter of book-keeping. Only by increasing the wealth of the world as a whole would it be possible to get real freedom of trade;and only by industrialising the waste spaces of the earth could wealth be increased.To reduce the American tariff, said Mr. Perkins, would be a direct attack uponthe most powerful vested interests in the United States. To tax Americans to subsidise the world would, in fact, be exacting equal sacrifices, but fewer people would be aware^of them and there would be plenty of vested interests to supportyou. I was impressed by the fact that Dr. Pasvolsky, one of the arch-priestsof the Hull policies, and Mr. Milo Perkins, in talking these matters over with me, both used practically identical language on one point. They both said that,if the American money that had been poured into Europe in the &quot; twenties &quot; hadbeen used for capital equipment instead of consumer goods, for industrial plantinstead -of swimming baths, the depression might have been avoided a similarityof outlook that I, for one, had not suspected.29. Mr. Henry Wallace, with whom I had a long talk one night after dinner,is a remarkably attractive man. I heard many accounts of him in washington and New York. To some he is a visionary and a crank. To others he is an extremely shrewd politician. I heard him spoken of, by fairly good judges, as having proved himself, at the Department of Agriculture, one of the ablestadministrators in Washington. He is ignorant of the outside world, exceptLatin America, and his suspicion of this country is deeply ingrained.&quot; Suspicion &quot; is perhaps hardly the right word, for I think he likes us. It is rather that it has never occurred to him that we could be in any way disinterestedor far-sighted. The education of Mr. Henry Wallace would be a task well worthundertaking, not only because if the President were to fall under a &apos;busMr. Wallace would be installed in the White House; but Mr. Wallace is a ratherfine type of American, Henry James&apos; &quot; American,&quot; in fact, translated from NewEngland to tJhe Middle West.30. It would be a mistake to suppose that Mr. Henry Wallace&apos;s economicideas were limited to &quot; a pint of milk for every child.&quot; He is obsessed withthe idea that the crucial problem in American economic life arises from thefact that the last frontier has been reached, and that American industry cannotexist except in an expanding economy. The only solution is to find new frontiersto push back, and these frontiers are in Europe, in South America and in China.In Mr. Wallace&apos;s view the best hope for American industry lies in theindustrialisation of the rest of the world. This suggests, perhaps, Americaneconomic imperialism in its most ruthless form.. But Mr. Wallace is not, inthis sense at any rate, an imperialist. Some weeks ago he wrote an article inthe New York Times denouncing those who spoke of maintaining, by tariff orsubsidy, the synthetic rubber industry after the war, and explaining that theUnited States could not afford to throw into the world economy a monkey-wrenchof this magnitude. He told me that he had hundreds of letters from all overthe country attacking him, and only three in support. &quot; I expected thatreaction,&quot; he said, &quot; but I was surprised by its violence. But people are selfishenough to be persuaded of their true interests if only you have sufficient patience.In any case I was able to persuade the President to put a clause in the Billgiving the Administration powers to buy up the industry.&quot; I think that this incident is significant, for it indicates that the lunatic fringe is not altogetherremote from the world of the sane.31. I have been so greatly impressed by the apparently disinterestedcharacter of American economic thought that I am inclined to wonder whethermy impression is not sheer illusion. I think not, for there is a&apos;hard core oftoughness and realism behind it that reassures me. M. Monnet told me thatAmericans are very expert traders with very, big minds. If you can match theirbigness you&apos;ll probably be all right. If you prefer to put it on a basis of puretrading they&apos;ll have the shirt off your back. I think that M. Monnet is right.Another acute observer conveyed something of the same idea when he said :Americans do business in two stages; first in the cocktail bar and then round the table.  The first stage is generous and understanding.   The second is shrewd
and tough. When you&apos;ve mastered the technique it isn&apos;t so bad. The Britishmake the very worst of both worlds. Thoy&apos;re reserved, suspicious and ill at easein the cocktail bar and then, when they get to the conference table, they panicand give way all along the line. It would pay them a great deal better to relaxfrom the start.&quot;32. When I suggested to Mr. Morgenthau that the prevailing idea (thatthe United States should foot the bill for the recovery of the whole world)seemed a little too good to be true; he threw up his hands and said : &quot; What elsecan we do? We can&apos;t save the capitalist system without it, and I guess that most of us want to save it.&quot; He said that if I would talk to the real peopleof America,to shop stewards and people like that, my mind would be at rest.&quot;They know where their interests lie.&quot; I did not speak to any shop stewardsbut I did have a long talk with Mr. Philip Murray, of the C.I.O., who certainlyseemed to confirm Mr. Morgenthau&apos;s view.33. Earlier in this paper I referred to the suspicions of our motives, whichare so general even among those well disposed towards us. These suspicions are based, all of them, upon serious misconceptions about the British Empire. while was in Washington or New York I had no desire to discuss the Colonial question or the Indian problem. I was trying to form some impression of the extent towhich we might rely upon American co-operation after the war in the politicaland economic field. But it was impossible to get away from the British Empire;whenever two or three were gathered together the subject inevitably cropped up;and it very soon became clear to me that unless we were able to remove themisunderstandings which exist in the mind of the average intelligent American,the chances of genuine Anglo-American collaboration would be small. This is so, because the Administration, whether this one or some successor, and howeverenlightened or friendly it may be, cannot go further than its public opinion will allow it. It would be untrue to suggest that American opinion would not takekindly to the idea of partnership with the British Empire. It is certainly thefact that it would not accept the idea of partnership with the kind of BritishEmpire which exists, highly coloured and completely distorted, in the Americanimagination. There is an intense interest in these questions. And there is themost astonishing ignorance -which is admitted with the utmost candour. Butit would be a mistake to suppose that, because the American attitude is rootedin ignorance far more than in malice, it is unimportant or that it will be easy to remove.34. Nor, I think, would it be wise to assume that the American attitude towhat they think of as &quot; imperialism &quot; is a surface agitation which has beenprovoked by events in the Far East and in India, and which will subside whenthe war takes a turn for the better. The normally prevailing attitude of mindhas been intensified by recent developments; it has not been created by them.&apos;There are ghosts which haunt the American scene ghosts of North and theHessian troops, ghosts, too, of ancient tyrannies from which so many of theAmerican people have fled in the past hundred and fifty years. It may be thatthese ghosts will never be laid, and that it will not be possible to instruct&apos; theAmerican people in the real nature of the British Empire. But it ought to bepossible to instruct the Administration and those influential circles outside ofit which are anxious to befriend us. And instruction is needed, not only in thefacts but also in our own attitude towards them. For there is everywhere thegreatest ignorance of our own intentions and doubts of our own faith in ourselves.I was very much struck by the very general belief, implied rather than stated,that we were ready ourselves to abdicate. And I found that protestations to thecontrary were received, not with anger, but with gentle and kindly incredulity.35. It is very necessary, I think, for us to understand, first of all, thenature*of the interest which Americans have in the British Empire. It is sostartling to find a blend of such fierce dogmatism and such bland ignorance, freelyconfessed, and, indeed, almost gloried in, that one is inclined to dismiss thewhole thing as the amiable aberration of a well-meaning but incurably meddle-some people.36. But the interest of Americans in these matters is very real and, in its way, very practical. If one were to say to them, as one is so often sorely tempted to do : &quot; Why are you so passionately anxious to instruct us in our relationships with native populations when you are quite unable to solve, for example, your ownnegro problem1? &quot; they would probably reply : &quot; Yes. You are absolutely right.The negro problem should never have arisen, reflects very badly upon us and is
probably quite insoluble. But we have a very much more practical interest in, say,India or Malaya than you have in Harlem or Alabama. Whatever we may or maynot do to the American negro you will hardly be affected. But we have a deepinterest in India, for we share the defence of India with you. And we have adeep interest in what you may feel called upon to do hereafter in Malaya or inthe Caribbean. For you may have to call upon us at some time to share in thedefence of those areas.&quot;37. This feeling that the Americans have of interest, almost of self-interest,in the British Empire is most marked in relation to India for India is the more urgent problem; India is regarded as part of the Japanese problem which is, ofcourse, far more real to them than it is to us. It would be difficult, I think, to exaggerate the importance of India in the minds not of American liberals onlybut of thoughtful Americans everywhere. I do not think that there is a greatdeal of interest among the general public (although Mr. Henry Luce would not agree with me).38. The general opinion about India in influential circles is roughly asfollows. &apos;&apos; India is a far more difficult problem than we had imagined. TheCripps mission taught us that. It taught us also that Britain is a good deal more enlightened than we have supposed. Nevertheless, the present position isclearly full of danger not only for Britain but for us as well. You may succeed in controlling violence for the moment. We do not believe that you can sit onthe safety valve for ever, and violence may become the more dangerous when it isdriven underground. Somehow or otiher you must come to terms with India.Is there nothing we can do to help ? &apos;&apos;39. This kind of opinion is widely held, and is deeply rooted. And it isfull of danger for the war effort. In the first place, I am inclined to think thata number of newspapers (the Washington Post is one) who have so far held them-selves back in the belief that, after all, we must know our own job best, may come out into the open with very strong criticism. If this happens, and if there is apublic storm, it will become much more difficult, I would think, for the president to hold his military in check (from the point of view of assignments forexample); and it will be more difficult for him to hold a balance between theFar Eastern war and the European war it is very difficult for us at home torealise how much closer Asia is, than Europe, to the minds of theAmerican people.40. The feeling about India in the United States is based in ignorance andmisunderstanding, but it is deeply rooted and, I think, it is dangerous. Never-theless it would not be altogether impossible to change it. The ignorance of the americans is such that one cannot help feeling resentment at what we regard as their unwarrantable interference. We feel, very justly, that these are matters for which we have the responsibility and in which the decision must be ours alone.It is an unfortunate fact that the Americans do not see things in the same light.They believe that they have an interest in these matters, and they believe that weshould admit their interest. It is difficult, in the circumstances, to avoid giving them the impression that we are determined to keep them at arm&apos;s length. this impression, however, only increases their anxiety to interfere. At the same time it does not convey to them an idea of strength and confidence and power. Onthe contrary, it gives support to the view which, unfortunately, more and more of them are beginning to hold, that we are little men of little minds and that thevision that has made England great has gone for good. I cannot help feeling that,if we could somehow let them see that we admit their interest in the problem(while maintaining our own responsibility for the final decision), we should gaintheir respect and diminish, rather than increase, the chances of an embarrassingAmerican initiative.41. As to China, Mr. Ashley Clarke and others have pointed out the quiteextraordinary feeling for China that there is in the United States. It is almost exactly comparable to the popular feeling in this country for Russia, but it is oflonger standing. But I do not think that I have seen anywhere an account ofone element in American thinking about China which to me, at any rate, is very marked. I mean their fear of China. I have already said that the Americanstend to think, in centuries and continents. And they are beginning now to see, inthe distant future, China as a greater and infinitely more dangerous Japan. they see China succeeding, as Japan never succeeded, in rallying the races of the East and arming them. They are anxious, therefore, not only to keep on terms with china, but, somehow or other, to bring China into the mainstream of Westernlife. . I had the impression very strongly that this conception of a militant China
leading a militant Asia against the West will become increasingly the background of their Far Eastern policy.42. It is difficult to know how we are to deal with the United States onthese great questions of imperial and world policy. When I left England 1thought that we ought to begin to formulate our own views and then state themclearly and fearlessly. I do not think now that this will be good enough. Forone thing it is very likely to land us in open controversy with the United states administration. The evil consequences of such a situation would be immeasurablydisastrous. It would be far better, I think, to discuss these problems informallywith the Americans before we make any public statement. I feel fairly confident that it would, be possible to make them see our point of view. And if they didsee it, they would find, I believe, that they were more in sympathy with it thanthey (or we) suppose-.43. I have found in Washington, as I have said, a genuine anxiety to work with us and a deeply rooted suspicion of our intentions. I believe that, withgreat difficulty and great understanding on our side, suspicions can be removed and a real basis for co-operation be found. always postulating the continued existence of the present Administration or of one remotely resembling it. Butit will be a most exhausting task, and the question must arise whether it is, in fact,worth attempting, or whether the Roosevelt Administration will be supplantedin two years&apos; time by one with which it will not be possible for us to co-operate.44. This is a question to which no clear answer can be given. It did seemto me that the position of the Administration was not so unchallengeable as it hadbeen; and I thought that the Presidents own prestige was not so high as it hadbeen. It is necessary to remember, too, that the Administration has been main-tained in power for so long by the votes of the underprivileged, that there are unlikely to be any underprivileged after two more years of war industry and warwages, and that gratitude is never so lively an emotion as a sense of favoursto come. But I would not venture to predict upon an issue so incalculable and soremote.45. I feel strongly, however, that there is everywhere, in all classes, the conviction that this war must not be allowed to happen again, and that theUnited States will have to see that it does not happen again. Sir RonaldCampbell has already compared the atmosphere in Washington to-day with thatof twenty-five years ago. He pointed out that then there was a minority ofpassionate crusaders, while to-day there is no passion and no crusade only amatter-of-fact realisation everywhere that tedious, unpleasant but inescapableresponsibilities have devolved upon the United States. In any case, I am convinced that Lord Halifax was absolutely right in his despatch of the summer of 1941, when he indicated that nothing was to be lost by our trying to come to terms with the present Administration, even though, in the event, it weresucceeded by a Republican Administration. As Lord Halifax pointed out, theRoosevelt Administration is organically well disposed towards us, it is likely to suit our book better than any other, and it is more likely to remain in power if itcan work with us.46. But, in any case, the co-operation of the United States (one might goso far as to say the support of the United States1) is so vital for the future&apos;of theBritish Empire that we must strain every nerve to remove misunderstandings.And it is important to remember that these misunderstandings upon which Ihave touched in this paper, those currents of opinion which we must divert intocourses more favourable to us, are not related only to the Democratic party.These misgivings are characteristic of Americans as a whole, irrespective of party.47. Above all, we must remember that the United States is not a cypher.There are infinite possibilities in America for good or evil. There is immensestrength and a wealth of good intentions. There is what must strike us as achildish over-simplification of problems of great complexity, and there is greatinexperience. But America is not a cypher. The Americans are going to make our world or mar it. Which they do will depend very largely upon us and uponthe extent to which we are able, first, to gain their confidence, and, secondly, to influence their policies.RICHARD LAW.Foreign Office, September 21, 1942.
