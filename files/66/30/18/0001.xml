Q2THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENi1,SECRET. war cabinet. orW P iL.2jL.88 copy no.6 2w,r* ^h /h labelling of cargoes.28th October, 19L-2,Note by Minister of War Transport.1. In view of tho interest which the Press has taken in therecent discussion in the House of Lords on the labelling of cargoes, I think my colleagues may like to have for their information the following brief outline of the arrangements whichare made to secure that no useful information reaches the enemyconcerning the routeing of cargo ships.2.    TRADE CONVOYS.As far as ordinary convoys, i*e.  convoys other thanoperational, are concerned, the Military Authorities ana theSecurity Executive rely on obtaining security through the keeping secret of sailing dates and of routes.      There is no advantage in concealing from the public that goods are being sent, e.g., to the Middle East or to North Russia.      Indeed,cargo sent for Malta via Alexandria has deliberately beenconspicuously labelled on occasion.For all these ordinary convoys the destinations of thepackages are marked in clear..     The Inter-Services Security Board,the Security Executive, the Movement Control and my department are satisfied that a general system of marking destinations incode is undesirable,      The security value is slight and isheavily outweighed by the resulting confusion and delays.Experience has shown that any code name becomes compromisedwithin three weeks.      To be effective,  therefore, codes wouldhave to be changed every three weeks, and since arrangementsfor the forwarding of cargo to a particular destination maystart a long time ahead, confusion is inevitable.It is, in any case, impossible to avoid giving clues toexperienced workers on ships on the quayside as to the destination of the ship.3.     SPECIAL CONVOYS.In the case of operational convoys such as those to Maltaor to Madagascar;, all cargo must be marked in code.In August j 19UI? an enquiry was held by theInter-Services Security Board on the security arrangements for aMalta convoy, because it was known the enemy had prior knowledgeof its approach, to the Mediterranean.      I am informed that although it transpired in the course of the enquiry that certainpackages labelled &quot;Malta&apos;&apos; were shipped by the convoy, theconclusion arrived at was that the knowledge was obtained byoperational and not intelligence means.The Board, however, recommended (inter alia)&quot;Marking of stores, baggage and mails - the port of discharge in clear, except that Egyptian ports would be grouped together as &quot;M.E.&quot;       In the case of special convoys,the markings will be fictitious.&quot;Subsequently, however, it was found necessary by theShipping Departments of the Services, to mark Middle East cargoby the name of the port, e0g., Alexandria, and in the case ofspecial convoys, to use a code word, and not the name of an actual port different from the real destination.-1-

In the ease of special convoys, Security Authoritiesattend at the embarking and loading ports, in order to observe that all security measures are adequate and are properly carried out.NORTH RUSSIAN CONVOYS.Convoys to North Russia are not treated as &quot;special&quot;,as they have been of a fairly regular nature and any codewould quickly become compromised.      Indeed, articles suchas tanks for Russia frequently bear conspicuous messages ofencouragement or greeting from the factory workers to theRussians.In any case, it would be almost impossible to concealthe destination of a ship bound for Russia.     The ships are specially strengthened to meet ice conditions, many portablestoves are added to fixed heating appliances, Arctic clothingis provided for the crew, some of the ships are speciallycamouflaged (by painting white), and Russian officials arcinvariably present.The arrangements for sailing P.Q.  convoys, however, are such that it is not possible for anyone to discover theactual sailing date or to estimate when the ships will arrive in the dangerous Northern waters.VIEWS OP SECURITY EXECUTIVE.In August last the U.S. Authorities proposed to put intoforce a system of code markings for all cargoes shipped fromthe U.S,       This proposal was considered by the Security Executiveon 15th September;    all Departments were agreed that such asystem was unworkable and Security Co-ordination, New York,was accordingly informed in detail of the reasons for this view.-The signal stated:    &quot;Use of code or false names of ports ofdestination should be used for special Military operations only*For ordinary shipments, ports of destination should be markeden clair and attention concentrated upon preventing enemy fromlearning the date and time of sailing, the route to be followed and whether the vessel is in convoy or unescorted.&quot;No recent allegation of breaches of the security measuresoutlined above has been substantiated.In the House of Lords I gave an assurance that the whole subject would be investigated, and in view of the wide interest which this matter has aroused, I felt it desirable to ask anindependent person to review the arrangements.      I am glad tosay that Mr. Justice Tucker has, with the Lord Chancellorrsconcurrence, undertaken to make this examination.L.Ministry of War Transport..28th October. 19U2.
