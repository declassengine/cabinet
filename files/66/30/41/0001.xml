[rpHTS DOCUMENT IS THE, PROPERTY Of HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)SECRET If&quot;P.  1 (U2)  511 COPY NO 25th llovcribor, 19h20WAR CABINETQuestion of the liability of Members ofParliament for compulsory fire prevention dutyaMemorandum by the Home Secretary and minister   of   Home   Security.,I feel that I must ask for the guidance of the Cabinet onthe fo3.1owing question that has arisen in regard to the liahilityof Members of Parliament for fire prevention dutye2c     The Cabinet will recall that when in September 1941 compulsoryregistration v/as ordered for the greater part of the country, itv/as decided not to exempt Ministers of the Crown as such but that,wherever a Minister considered that compulsory fire preventionduty v/as incompatible with the discharge of his duties as a Minister,I should be authorised to grant him an individual certificate of exemption.-,    In the case of Scottish Ministers certificates were issued by the Secretary of State for Scotland.,    The certificates soissued cover fire prevention, duty both where the Minister works and under the local authority in the area where he lives.3*      No question of exempting Members of Parliament as such was raised at that time but one Member of Parliament (Mr*T.L.Horabin, MJ%who, apart from being a Member of Parliament, is liable to compulsory enrolment in the place where he livesf. has now claimed that under the statement made by t.he Prime Minister in regard tothe liabilities of Members of Parliament to be called up for service in the Armed Forces, he is entitled to decide for himselfv/hether or not to- perform such duties-,    mr Horabin has not in.fact registered (which is the first step towards compulsoryenrolment) but he has informed the Town Clerk that he will do sowhen his duties permit, and in a letter to me he has stated that&quot;at no time have I claimed, that a Member of Parliament is exempt from registration4&apos; 0    As regards enrolments he has gone so far asto inform me that in view of the Prime Minister ?s statement he cannot see his way even to apply to me for a certificate of exemption as &quot;to do so would strike at the roots of theconstitutional position of a Member of Parliament&quot;.    (Copies ofmy correspondence with him are attached)0he     As I understand it;, the declaration made by the Prime minister was concerned only with &quot;full timo,! compulsory service in the armed Forces,,    On the other hand, I consider that we ought not topress a Member of Parliament to give part-time service for fire prevention (or other civil defence) dutiesj, if the performance ofsuch duties is likely to interfere with his Parliamentary dutiesoI consider further that this doctrine should be interpreted in abroad and tolerant spirits5e     The position is somewhat different in the case, of a Member ofthe House of Lordsr since he is not under an obligation constaWi,jto visit a constituencyo    I feel, however,  that if such a casewere to arise it would not be possible to&apos;draw a distinctionbetween a Member of the House of Commons and a Member of theHouse of Lords*After consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland,

-2-I accordingly recommend :-(a) that we should take the line that Members of the Houseof Commons are required to register;(b) that where a Member of the House of Commons sitting foran English or Welsh seat or for a seat in Northern Irelandfeels unable to reconcile the performance of his parliamentary duties with a liability to perform fire prevention duties, he should apply for exemption fromenrolment to the Minister of Home Security;that if the Member concerned sits for a Scottish seathe should make application &quot;to. the Secretary of Statefor Scotland;that such application should normally be granted;that a similar procedure should be followed if anapplication for exemption were received from a Member ofthe House of Lords.7*     The above memorandum has been shown, in draft, to the attorney-General, who has been good enough to furnish me withhis observations as set out in his note herewith attached.    I gather the Attorney-General thinks it important that care should be taken in framing any reply to Mr. Horabin&apos;s letter tome to avoid expressing any opinion on the question of privilege,and that any offer of exemption should be put on the basis thatI think it convenient and important in the public interest thata Member should not be required to carry out fire preventionduties if in his judgment they would interfere with his parliamentary duties.H.M.(c)(a)(s)HOME OFFICE.6th November. 19U2.

Question of the Liability of Members of parliament for Compulsory Fire Prevention Duty.Note by the Attorney-General.Mr. Horabin is not disputing his liability to register,nor is he disputing that Members are included in the&quot;persons&quot; to whom the relevant Orders apply.     His point isthat he has a free choice where his duties as a citizenconflict with his duties as a Member.     He therefore objectsto applying for exemption to &quot;the Home Secretary, and on thispoint he refers to the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.     Tu;Vtstatement was dealing with full time service in the Army.In any case, however, it contemplates, as I read it, that the member would apply to the appropriate Department either.for release or for exemption from calling up, but it gives anundertaking that the Department will accept the Member&apos;s view and act accordingly.     If the principle laid down in thestatement is regarded as applicable here the last sentence of the Home Secretary&apos;s letter to Mr. Horabin of the l6thSeptember is in some conflict with it.The legal position is not that a Member can decide thesematters for himself but that, if summoned by some authority in circumstances which would, in his view, conflict with hisprivileges as a Member, he can claim privilege.     In the last resort Parliament or the Courts can adjudicate on the matter.There is of course nothing in the Prime Minister&apos;s statement in conflict with this.     Pie was stating the attitude ^hich the   .Government took up with regard to the particular subject matter with which he was dealing.     Although it would be aninconvenient course, I think a Member, without getting anyexemption from the Home Secretary, could wait and claimprivilege if and when summoned for fire watching on an occasion when obeying the summons would conflict with his parliamentary duties.     It is however important that those responsible for the organisation of fire watching should know whether those who may be liable to fire watch will or willnot be available.     It is reasonable therefore to ask a member in advance/* or that a Member should make clear in advance,whether so far as he can foresee he will be unavailable oravailable only on certain nights.     The proper line istherefore, I&apos;think, not that tho Member must get an exemptionin order to be able to claim privilege, but that, if he thinkshe is unlikely to be available or fully available on grounds of privilege, he should make this clear in advance..     If he sodesires there seems no reason why he should not take the matter up with the Home Secretary rather than with any subordinateauthority so that the Home Secretary can give the necessary instructions.     The matter can be I have no doubt, and in man;cases probably has been, settled by the Member with the localauthority, the Member agreeing to watch on certain non-parliamentary nights ancl undertaking to give sufficientnotice if ho finds he cannot be available on parliamentarygrounds.There remains the question whether, if a Member claims that his duties prevent his doing any fire watching, this

should be accepted.     It would probably go beyond anythinghe could establish on the facts as privilege.     If it is decided not to accept such a claim, I think it would bebetter for the Home Secretary not to purport to decide it,but to express his opinion and suggest that the Membershould raise the matter in the House so that the House can,after reference to the Committee of Privileges or otherwise,give a ruling.     The fact that the Deputy Prime Minister andI are both on the Committee of Privileges makes it undesirable, if it can be avoided, that the government or a Minister should appear to have come to a firmconclusion on a matter or privilege.(intld.)

16th September, 1942Dear Mr. Horabin,The Town Clerk of Paddington has been in correspondence with my Department regarding yourregistration pursuant to the Civil Defence Duties(Compulsory Enrolment) Orders.I am informed that you claim that as aMember of Parliament you have the right to decideyourself whether or not the carrying out of duties in the Forces or other services would interferewith your duties as a Member of Parliament.     I amcausing the Town Clerk to be informed that you arenot exempt from the liability to register.If, however, you put in an application to myDepartment for exemption from enrolment, such anapplication will, of course, be given consideration.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.) HERBERT MORRISON.T. L. Horabin, Esq., M.P.

copy-House of CommonsSeptember 24th, 1942.Dear Mr. Morrison,Thank you for your letter of the 16th September.At no time have I claimed that a Member of parliament is exempt from registration.What I did refuse to do was to appeal to the localtribunal for exemption on the grounds that a Member ofParliament has a free choice in such questions where Ms duties as a citizen may be in conflict with his duties as a Memberof Parliament.On the same grounds I cannot put in an application for exemption to you.     To do so would strike at the roots ofthe constitutional position of a Member of Parliament.I would refer you to the following extract from astatement made by the Prime Minister on 11 D^g.c.m.g..ber 1941(Hansard Vol. 376 Col. 1684)&quot;In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government it would notbe appropriate to confer on Members of Parliament a statutory exemption from the obligations which tJaeyshare in common with everyone else.     Members of&apos;Parliament have, however, also the high duty of service in the Legislature, and they must themselves be the judges of hov; that duty can best be performed.     Theyarc therefore given a free choice by virtue of their position as Members of Parliament and not as a favour.This was the position in the last war, and has alwaysbeen maintained in the present war.&quot;Yours sincerely,(Sgd.) T.L. HORABIN *
