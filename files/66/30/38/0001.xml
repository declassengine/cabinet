THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1942.SECRET.W.P. (42) 508.November 3, 1942.WAR CABINET.ENEMY BREACHES OF THE RULES OF WARFARE.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.I was asked by the Cabinet(&apos;) to get out a statement which would demonstrate inhumanity with which the German army had treated prisoners of war and civilians, so that it might be used if the Germans denounced the Geneva Conven-tion upon the basis of our breach.The general lines of the attached document (which has had to be preparedvery hurriedly) is to show (i) how wide has been their disregard of convention;(ii) how brutal has been the behaviour of their soldiers.I have made it rather full, as otherwise it would look like a studiouslyselected list which would not be very convincing spread over the wide area and long time period of the war.R. S. C.Gwydyr House,November 3, 1942.Copy No*ENEMY BREACHES OF THE RULES OF WARFARE.A. Introductory.The Hague and Geneva Conventions, as a perusal of the relevant provisionsreferred to later in the memorandum will show, were designed to avoid so faras possible amid the horrors of war unnecessary suffering to the non-combatantcivilian population and to the helpless, including the sick, wounded and prisonersof war. The Germans, on the other hand, have sought to introduce into this warevery circumstance which could add terror and suffering and misery to non-combatants and to the helpless. Their aim has been, by recourse to practices towhich the conscience of the civilised world has already expressed its ahhorrence,to frighten their opponents into refraining from actions which they themselvesfear, and ultimately, as they hope, into submission. They have failed, and theywill continue to fail, to achieve their object. But it is not surprising that, intheir pursuit of it, they have been driven to disregard cynically many of theinternational conventions to which they pledged themselves. Their policy is sofundamentally inconsistent with the principles underlying honest adherence tothose conventions that at first sight it seems idle to make any specific examinationof. the breaches which they have committed. Nevertheless, it is perhaps not wholly without profit to observe once more the contrast between German professionand German performance. This memorandum is not intended to be exhaustive,but it is at least instructive as an illustration of the degree of reliance to beplaced on the word of the German Government.H W.M. 144th Conclusions.[24585] B
B. merchant t Shipping.The Germans began the war by an immediate contravention of the Proces-Verbal relating to Rules of Submarine Warfare in Part 4 of the Treaty of london of the 22nd April. 1930 (Command Paper 5302 of 1936), to which the Germansacceded in 1936. By rule 2 of that document it is provided that &quot; except in thecase of persistent refusal to stop on being duly summoned, or of active resistance to visit or search, a warship, whether surface vessel or submarine, may not sinkor render incapable of navigation a merchant vessel without having first placedpassengers, crew and ship&apos;s papers in a place of safety. For this purpose theship?s boats are not regaided as a place of safety unless the safety of the passengers and crew is assured, in the existing sea and weather conditions, bythe proximity of land or the presence of another vessel which is in a position totake them on board.&quot;From the beginning of the war the Germans persistently violated this rule in their attacks on Allied and Neutral merchant ships. As early as the30th September, 1939, they sank a Neutral ship by a submarine without wrarningand with loss of life. This was the Danish ship Vendia bound for the Clyde in ballast. The submarine fired two shots and shortly afterwards torpedoed theship. The torpedo was fired when the Master had already signalled that he would submit to the submarined orders and before there had been any opportunity toabandon ship.By November 1939 submarines were sinking Neutral vessels without warningas a regular thing. On the 12th November the Norwegian Arne Kjode was torpedoed in the North Sea without warning. She was a tanker bound from oneNeutral port to another. The Master and four of the crew lost their lives, andthe remainder were picked up after many hours in open boats. From that time on merchant ships were constantly sunk without&apos; the slightest regard to theobligation imposed by the ride for insuring the safety of passengers and crew.A good illustration of this practice is afforded by the sinking of the City ofBenares on the 17th September, 1940. The City of Benares was an 11,000-ton linerwith 191 passengers on board, including neariy 100 children. She was torpedoedwithout warning just outside &quot; the war zone &quot; with the loss of 258 lives, including77 children. It was blowing a gale with hail and rain squalls and a very roughsea when the torpedo struck her at about 10 p.m. In the darkness, and owingto the prevailing weather conditions, at least four of the twelve boats loweredwere capsized. Others were swTamped and many people were wrashed right outof them. In one boat alone 16 people, including 11 children, died from exposure.In another. 22 died, including 15 children. In a third. 21 died. &apos; Such resultsas this are inevitable when a belligerent disregards the rules of sea-warfare asthe Germans do. The Commander of the U-Boat must have known that this wasa large merchant ship, probably with civilian passengers on board, certainly witha crew of merchant seamen. He knew7 the state of the weather, and he knew thatthey were 600 miles from land. Yet he followed them outside the Blockade area which the Germans themselves had defined and deliberately abstained from firinghis torpedo until after nightfall, when the chances of rescue would be enormouslvdiminished. There could hardly be a more flagrant disregard of the rule regardingsubmarine warfare by which the Germans, like ourselves, had agreed to be boundsC. Hospital Ships.By No. 10 of the Hague Conventions of 1907, namely, the Convention for the adaptation of the Principles of the Geneva Convention to Maritime War, it isprovided in Article 1 : &quot; Military hospital-ships, that is to say, ships constructedor adapted by States for the particular and sole purpose of aiding the sick,wounded, and shipwrecked, the names of which have been communicated to the belligerent Powers at the commencement or during the course of hostilities, andin any case before they are employed, shall be respected, and may not be capturedwhile hostilities last.&quot; By Article 16 of the same Convention it is furtherprovided : &quot; After every engagement, the two belligerents shall, so far as militaryinterests permit, take steps to look for the sick, wounded, and shipwrecked, andto protect them, as well as the dead, against pillage and improper treatment.&quot;It is, of course, possible in darkness, or when the hospital ships concerned are not plainly marked in accordance with the Hague Convention, for mistakesto arise and hospital ships to be attacked unintentionally. But it is certain thatduring operations in Home Waters the enemy had, by the middle of July 1940,execute deliberate and flagrant attacks by aircraft and shore batteries uponBritish hospital ships and carriers.   Many of the ships attacked were severely
damaged, with heavy casualties, and three ships the Maid of Kent, Brightonand Paris were sunk. Over half of these attacks took place in broad daylightand all the ships concerned were marked in accordance with the Hague Conven-tion and were, in all other respects, conforming to the requirements of theConvention.In consequence of these and other infringements of the Hague Convention,His Majesty&apos;s Government announced on the 3rd July, 1941, that they had decidedto detain the Italian hospital ship Ramb IV, which fell into our hands atMassawa, for a minimum period of six months in replacement of the ships lostor damaged by the enemy&apos;s wilful action. If, afterwards, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were satisfied that the enemy had the firm intention of refraining from further attacks ancl the power to ensure that Axis forces carried out thatintention, they would consider the return of the Ramb IV to the ItalianGovernment.After this announcement, British hospital ships in the Mediterranean fora short period enjoyed the immunity to which they are entitled under Inter-national Law, though two torpedoes were fired by a plane at the hospital shipAtnra in the Red Sea on the night of the 6th/7th August. Then between the endof November 1941 ancl the end of February 1942 eight separate attacks were made upon British hospital ships in the eastern basin of the Mediterranean and thehospital ship Somersetshire was torpedoed and severely damaged by an Italiansubmarine in broad daylight on April 7. On the 10th May the Italian hospital ship Ramb IV, which was being employed as a British hospital ship in accordancewith His Majesty&apos;s Governments declaration, was attacked and sunk by Axisaircraft while carrying sick and wounded from Tobruk, with severe loss of life.The ship was carrying all the marks which normally distinguish a hospital ship.D. Hospitals.Article 27 of Chapter I, Section II, of No. 4 of the Convention of 1907provides for all necessary steps to be taken in sieges and bombardments to spareas far as possible hospitals and places where the sick ancl wounded are collected.It is obvious that in indiscriminate attacks upon towns from the air it isdifficult and in some cases impossible to safeguard against the bombing of hospitals, but there have been many cases in which the enemy have deliberatelyselected hospitals for attack. For instance, on the 25th and 26th April, 1942,well-identified military hospitals at Malta were deliberately attacked and heavily damaged by Italian and German aircraft. These attacks were carried outrepeatedly and resulted not only in the demolition of many hospitals but also inthe death of several patients and the injury of others. Similarly, in Crete, onthe morning of the 24th May, 1941, at about 8 a.m., several waves of bombers anclfighter planes repeatedly crossed and recrossed at an extremely low altitude thearea of No. 7 General Hospital. Several sticks of bombs were released. Thiscontinued for about three-quarters of an hour. Two or three marquees wereobliterated, several medical officers and other ranks were killed. The hospitalbuildings bore the Red Cross marking on the roof. In addition a large Red Crosson a white background was set out on the ground in the centre of the hospitalarea ancl flags were also flying at each end of the hospital site.In France, in May 1940, there were several instances of German bombersmachine-gunning the whole length of a convoy of ambulances, and on May 23,1940,No. 6 C.C.S. at Bailleul was bombed in daylight by enemy aircraft. The station was clearly marked with many Red Crosses and there was no military activity in the neighbourhood.E. Improper use of Red Cross Markings.By Article 27 of Chapter I of Section II of No. 4 of the Hague convention of 1907 it is provided that the protection afforded to hospitals, among other places,is subject to the proviso that they are not being used at the time for military purposes and it is further laid down that it is the duty of the beseiged to indicatesuch buildings or places by distinctive and visible signs which shall be notified to the enemy beforehand&apos;. It is similarly provided by Article 8 of -No. 10 of thesame Convention that hospital ships are no longer entitled to protection if theyare employed for the purpose of injuring the enemy.These are provisions designed to prevent the abuse of the protection whichthe. conscience of civilised, mankind has agreed to be proper for hospitals and hospital ships. It is a necessary corollary of affording such protection thatprovisions should be made against its abuse. The Axis powers have consistently[24585] . b 2
abused this protection. On the 23rd December. 1941. the Italian hospital ship&quot; Sieilia&quot; left Benghazi for Tripoli in Libya carrying a large number ofunwounded persons including naval officers, soldiers and prisoners of war.Similarly on the 8th September. 1941, unwounded military personnel wereembarked on an Italian hospital ship at Vathy (in Samos) for the Piraeus.During October 1941 many Italian troops were billeted in the main hospitalof Hermoupolis at Syra, and the hospital bore prominent Red Cross markings.On the 24th November, 1941, Italian hospital ships were frequently used to carrytroops between the islands in the Mediterranean. Again troops, ammunition and fuel were kept in the European Barracks south of Misurata and in Home Barrackswhich bore Red Cross markings on the roofs.In June 1941 the Italian hospital ship &quot;Toscana &quot; discharged ammunitionat Samos and then sailed after loading 300 sick and one Italian artillery regiment.There are other examples of the same practices, but it is unnecessary tomultiply instances of this wholesale disregard of the terms of the Convention.F. Prisoners of War.The International Convention of 1929, relative to the treatment of prisonersof war. provides by Article 2 as follows : &quot; Prisoners of war are in the powerof the hostile Government, but not of the individuals or formation whichcaptured them. They shall at all times be humanely treated and protected,particularly against acts of violence, from insults and from public curiosity.Measures of reprisal against them are forbidden.&quot; Article 30 of the sameConvention provides: &quot;the duration of the daily work of prisoners of war,including the time of the journey to and from work, shall not be excessive andshall in no case exceed that permitted for civil workers of the locality employedon the same work. Each prisoner shall be allowed a rest of twenty-four consecutivehours each week, preferably on Sunday.&quot;By Article 31, &quot; work done by prisoners of war shall have no direct connectionwith the operations of the war. In particular, it is forbidden to employ prisoners in the manufacture or transport of arms or munitions of any kind, or on thetransport of material destined for combatant units.&quot; By Article 50 it is laiddown as follows : &quot; Escaped prisoners of war who are re-captured before theyhave been able to rejoin their own armed forces or to leave the territory occupiedby the armed forces which captured them shall be liable only to disciplinarypunishment. Prisoners who, after succeeding in rejoining their armed forces orin leaving the territory occupied by the armed forces which captured them, areagain taken prisoner shall not be liable to any punishment for their previousescape.&quot; Again, by Article 54, limitation is imposed on disciplinary punishment for prisoners of war; this article provides : &apos;&apos;&apos; Imprisonment is the most severedisciplinary punishment which may be inflicted on a prisoner of war. the duration of any single punishment shall not exceed thirty days.&quot; Moreover, by article 56, prisoners of war may not be transferred to penitentiary establishmentssuch as prisons in order to undergo disciplinary sentence there.Not only do these provisions demand humane treatment and protection for prisoners of war during the whole period of their captivity, but they prescribespecifically that escaped prisoners of war who are recaptured shall be liable onlyto a limited period of disciplinary punishment. A plain case of German contra-vention of this international agreement is that of No. R. 6360 F.-Sgt. H. M.Robertson, R.C.A.F. On the 30th April, 1942, this N.C.O., with three comrades,attempted to escape from a train while in transit between Stalag IXc and StalagLuft III. They were all recaptured within a few hundred yards, and afterrecapture were clubbed by their guards with rifles and kicked and beaten and shot when their hands were up and while getting back into the train. No atten-tion was paid to their injuries during the remainder of their journey : they were refused water and medical attention. As a result of his wounds and injuries onthis occasion Sgt. Robertson died.In September 1940, No. 3444749 Cpl. M. J. Hogan, R.A.S.C., was recapturedin France wearing civilian clothing and passing as a French civilian! TheGermans discovered that he was an escaped prisoner of war, but, nevertheless,imprisoned him in. solitary confinement in Loos prison for five months. At oneof the several interrogations by the Gestapo he was struck in the face and kickedby the sergeant and guards of the escort. No. 4915273 L/Cpl. S. Green, R.A.S.C.,was captured at La Bassfe on the 26th May, 1940. His valuables and moneywere taken from him. When he protested at a soldier tearing up his personalphotographs another soldier knocked him out by a blow across the face with ahand grenade.   He still bore the scars in October 1941.   Between July and
September 1940, after an attempt at escape from Staiag XXa, he was strippedand beaten with rubber truncheons by young Nazis until he lost consciousness.He witnessed the murder of a Polish prisoner who attempted to escape. Thisprisoner was kicked and then trampled until he was dead.There is another instance of three British officers who escaped from a camp,were arrested by the German Secret Police and kept in solitary confinement in prison at Lille for five months. They were kept in cells 15 feet by 9 feet with noartificial lighting, were allowed no exercise, and their only food was dry bread and a little soup. From time to time they were subjected to interrogation, but were allowed no communication with the military authorities. (When the latterheard of their plight, they had them at once transferred to a proper prisoners-of-war camp.)There are many cases where the obligation to treat prisoners humanely andto protect them and to limit their disciplinary punishment has been disregarded.One such case is that of Sgt. Jack, P/W 6437. This N.C.O., on the 11th June,1941, at Staiag XXI C/H, was ordered by the guards to re-enter the barrackbuilding and while doing so was shot and killed.At Staiag XX B there was, in February 1942, a Sonder Kompanie described by the German guards in their less cautious moments as a Straflage, in whichprisoners of war seven French and three English lived in earthen hutsbehind barbed wire, which separated them from the rest of the camp. They weremade to work without pay and were kept apart from the other prisoners. Theyhad undergone disciplinary punishment and were being subjected to what was described as &quot; re-education! &apos; A similar system was to be found in Staiag IXcin November 1941 and April 1942.There are numerous other manifest breaches of the Code established in 1929 :cases in which, in May to July 1940, prisoners on the line of march throughFrance and Belgium were shot dead for falling out through exhaustion : cases inwhich prisoners were brutally struck with rifle butts, with hand grenades, withrubber truncheons and with bayonets : cases in which prisoners of war, captured in Norway, were kept in the hold of a ship for seven days; they were given souponce a day, but no water; the only provision for sanitation was a barrel loweredinto the hold. On arrival the prisoners were so weak that they had to be carriedup the ladders from the hold and collapsed on the quay. They, were sent on by rail to Thorn so tightly squeezed into a truck that the door was shut with difficulty. They were made to travel twenty-four hours without food or water.On detrainment men fell out of the truck fainting. Again, prisoners of warcaptured in France in 1940 were sent from Holland into Germany by barge. the voyage lasted five days, during which they were kept below deck without food,except for one slice of bread each provided by the Dutch Red Cross. They could hardly walk when they landed.Our prisoners of war captured in Greece and Crete suffered particularly from this type of infringement of the Geneva Convention. One train-load, atleast, of British wounded who were sent from Greece to Germany travelled inlocked baggage and cattle trucks for five days without any provision of food orsanitary facilities. On the 20th May, 1941, shortly after the capture of MalameAerodrome, 30 men were forced to march with their hands up towards a british position, thus acting as cover for German troops. Several of the party were killed and others wounded. On the morning of the 24th May, 1941, Germanparachutists forced some 5 or 6 hundred patients and medical personnel who hadtaken cover from the bombing of No. 7 General Hospital in Crete out of the slittrenches in which they had taken cover. By threatening these patients and.medical personnel with tommy guns, rifles and hand grenades parachutists com-pelled them to march into the olive groves towards Galatas. Thus the sick and wounded and doctors were used as a screen and came under fire from the18th Battalion of the New Zealand Infantry and suffered casualties. In July1941, a party of prisoners of war were taken from Canea Camp to a place about miles from Malame Aerodrome, where the Germans were putting coastalguns into position. The prisoners were forced to carry shells for these guns to anunderground dump. They were employed on this job for four days. On the21st May, 1941, some 40 prisoners of war captured on the previous day were compelled to work on Malame Aerodrome. One who refused in face of threats to drive a partly unserviceable bren gun carrier out of the dry river bed was shotdead before the other prisoners. On the aerodrome they were forced to unloadfield guns and ammunition from Junker planes. Several men who refused to do this work were killed. The work continued for several days. For the first three days the prisoners received no food. For some time the aerodrome was under[24585] .&apos; b 3
heavy shell fire from British artillery and the prisoners suffered many casualties.They were not allowed to attend to their own wounded. They were also exposed to bombs and machine-gun fire from British aircraft. They were further employedunder fire to fill in bomb and shell craters. No. 966694 L.A.C. Williamson, R.A.F.,though badly wounded in the right arm, was compelled to use a spade to fill inholes. No. 563314 Sgt. H. Wilkinson, R.A.F.. who objected to the work, waskicked and beaten and had to be laid down at the side of the aerodrome.The Geneva Convention is largely concerned with matters of clothing, shelter,food, health, washing and exercise facilities, and hours of work. There are numerous examples of German breaches of these provisions, but it is unnecessary to set them forth here since the matters already detailed in the above paragraphare enough to show how shamelessly the rules laid down have been violated bythe enemy.It should, however, be stated that reports of intolerably long working hourshave been received from work detachments, particularly those attached to StalagsHid. Vila. VHIb, IXc and XXb, and Work Camp IVa. For example, in one case prisoners were forced to work 12 hours a day for seven weeks without a break,in direct contravention of Article 30.The infringements of the convention -which have been recorded above inrelation to British prisoners of war cannot be regarded in isolation. There is an overwhelming mass of material illustrating callous and brutal treatment ofprisoners in the cases of our Allies.In the case of Soviet war prisoners, instances are recorded along the wholelength of the front from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea of the finding of bodies of Soviet war prisoners who had been tortured to death. Such instances are given on the Crimean front in the area of Height 66 - 3, and in the village of Dzhantora,where on the 2nd and 6th March, 1942, Soviet troops found 9 bodies of capturedRed Army soldiers so savagely mutilated by the enemy that only 2 bodies couldbe identified. These prisoners who had been tortured to death had had theirfinger nails torn out and their eyes gouged out. One body had had the wholeright side of the chest cut away; others bore traces of torture with fire, numerousknife wounds and smashed jaws. In Feodosia scores of bodies of Soviet Azer-baidjanians were found who had been tortured to death in a similar way. Inthe village of Krasnoperovo. in the Smolensk region, advancing Red Army unitsfound the naked bodies of 29 Red Army men and commanders without a singlewound inflicted by fire-arms they had all been stabbed to death by knives.In the same district, in the village of Babayevo, the enemy put 58 capturedRed Army men and 2 girl stretcher-bearers beside a hay stack and set light toit.  When the prisoners attempted to escape from the fire the Germans shot them.These are but typical cases, of which many other instances could be quoted.Moreover, there are a large number of examples where Soviet prisoners have been used by the German Command for clearing mine-fields. In the area of the villagesof Bolshaya Vgoya and Malaya Vygova, in the course of four days scores ofprisoners of war were driven by the enemy in close formation across the mine-fields. Each day several war prisoners were blown up by mines. This methodof murdering war prisoners was recommended by Order of the Day No. 109 ofthe 203rd Infantry Regiment, which read : &quot; The Commander-in-Chief of theArmy, General Field-Marshal Runstedt, has ordered that with a view to thepreservation of German blood, the search for mines and clearing of mine-fields,apart from actual war operations, must be carried out by Russian prisoners ofwar; the same refers also to German mines.&quot;If further evidence were required that oases of ill-treatment of prisoners ofwar by the enemy were not isolated and unauthorised acts by individual groups,but were sanctioned and encouraged by higher authority, it is to be found in such orders as that issued as an Order of the Day of the Headquarters of the88th Regiment, 34th German Infantry Division, entitled : &quot; Situation withregard to clothing.&quot; This provides as follows : &quot; Without any hesitation stripRussian war prisoners of their foot-wear.&quot; Again, in the files of the 234thInfantry Regiment of the 56th Division, a circular was found, No. 121 /4, datedthe 6th June, 1941, entitled : &quot; On principles of supply in the East,&quot; on the8th page of this it is stated : &quot; Do not rely on supplies of clothing. there forfeit is particularly important to take from war prisoners foot-wear fit for use and immediately to make use of all clothes, underwear, socks, &amp;c.&quot;G. -Occupied Territories.In the 4th Hague Convention of 1907, Section III is concerned with military authority over the Territory of the Hostile State.   By Article 43, &quot; the occupant
shall do all in his power to restore and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety, respecting at the same time, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country.&quot;By Article 45, &quot; it is forbidden to force the inhabitants of occupied territory to swear allegiance to the hostile Power.&quot;By Article 46, &quot; family honour and rights, individual life, and private property, as well as religious convictions and worship, must be respected. private property may not be confiscated.&quot;By Article 47, &quot; pillage is expressly forbidden.&quot;&apos;By Article 50, &quot; no collective penalty, pecuniary or otherwise, shall be inflictedupon the population on account of the acts of individuals for which it cannot beregarded as collectively responsible.&quot;By Article 52, &quot; requisitions in kind and services shall not be demanded from local authorities or inhabitants except for the needs of the Army of Occupation.&quot;By Article 56, &quot; the property of local authorities, as well as that of institu-tions dedicated to public worship, charity, education, and to science and art, even when State property, shall be treated&apos; as private property. Any seizure or destruction of. or wilful damage to, institutions of this character, historicmonuments and works of science and art, is forbidden and should be made thesubject of legal proceedings.&quot;The world has become so accustomed to the horrors which have been perpe-&apos;trated by the German Army in Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Russia,among other countries, that it is almost impossible to believe that the Germanspay even lip service to the provisions of the Convention set out above. It wouldbe wasted labour to set out individual instances of breaches of particularobligations described in those Conventions, when it is manifest that the policypursued by the Axis, for example, in Poland and that part of Yugoslavia whichthey intend to include in the greater Reich, is wholly incompatible with theprinciples of the Convention. The policy in these territories is one of extermina-tion of Poles and Slovenes for the purpose of Germanising the area. As a result,mass killings of local inhabitants contrary to Article 50 of the Hague Conven-tion No. 4--are a common feature. It takes an outrage of the enormity of thecrime of the 10th June, 1942, to stir the anger of the Allied peoples to a realisation of what the Germans are doing contrary to their pledged word. On that datethey razed to the ground the village of Lidice, near Kladno. Its men were shot,the women dragged off to concentration camps, and the children torn from theirmothers and taken off by the Nazis. It was then officially announced that thiswhole Czech village had been exterminated. It is of little use in such circum-stances to consider the extent to which in this and other cases there has been a breach of a provision designed to protect family honour and rights, individuallife and private property.In Yugoslavia in 1941 Slovene girls, between the ages of 16 and 20, were sent off from some of the villages in batches of sixty in sealed trucks marked&quot; F.M.M.&quot; (Freie Militar-Maclchen) for the use of the German Army. Whensome of the clergy, hearing of this plan, helped the peasants to get theirdaughters married hurriedly so as to have husbands to protect them. Churchmarriages were forbidden, and those who were engaged in speeding up theprocess were arrested.The provision which necessitates that no collective penalty shall be inflictedupon the population on account of the acts of individuals, for which it cannot beregarded as collectively responsible, has been infringed, over and over again. on one occasion in Warsaw fifty-three male Jews were shot because the inhabitants of one house had obstructed the police in their search for a criminal.In November 1939 twelve young boys, between 11 and 16, were shot at Thorn,in Western Poland, because a pane of glass in the police station had been brokenby a stone.The total number of executions in Poland, up to April 1941, has risen to70,000. According to provisional calculations made by the Polish Government,the number of German murders can be estimated at a minimum of 400,000.There is also a great increase in the number of people sent by the Germans tothose vast colonies of torture and death, the concentration camps.The worst possible treatment is meted out by the Gestapo to those who aresubjected to interrogation insults, degrading mockery, torture. As a result,mortality in the camps and prisons is very high. Some of the deaths are dueto suicide, which the victims prefer rather than face a repetition of the tortureswhich await them.As stated above, German district governors have decreed collective responsi-bility for whole districts.   The following examples may be cited:  On the
23rd November, 1941. the whole population of SzczepankoAvo, Krzesiny, nearPoznan, was arrested under the pretext that threatening letters had been sentto the head of the German police of that district. Many hundreds of men andwomen were maltreated, ten of whom died as a result of blows and woundsreceived.During March 1942 a German policeman having been killed near Kalisz,sixty people were shot. In the same month, at Sulmierzyce, near Kepno, tenpeople were shot. Also in March, 100 hostages were shot in Warsaw forthe killing of one German: In May, also in Warsaw, at the Pawiak prison,198 people were executed. The same thing happened at Modlin on the 28th May,1942 18 men and 22 women. In the district around Vilno. 400 hostages were shot to avenge the death of two German soldiers.Mention should be made here particularly of the murder of Polish citizens of the Jewish faith, for example at Lublin, Stanislawow, Vilno and Chelmo,where tens of thousands were killed in asphyxiating gas chambers.This last method of execution should he described, horrible as it is to readabout, as an example of how calculated and deliberate Nazi brutality can be.Here is an account by an eye witness: The Jews were driven with batonsand rifle-butts into two : execution cars.&apos; .... Wild scenes of panic and despairtook place. The cars were grey lorries, with doors at the back which could bebolted and hermetically sealed. The sides were lined with sheet metal and therewas a wooden grating on the floor, underneath which there were pipes coveredwith wire netting. These pipes were connected Avith a gas apparatus, workedfrom the driver&apos;s cabin. After the victims had been piled in and the lorrieshermetically sealed they were driven off to a forest about five miles away in thedirection of Kolo. The place of execution Avas a little off the road and waspatrolled by policemen armed with light machine guns. By the edge of the roadwas a pit 16 ft. deep, 5 ft. wide at the bottom and 16 ft. wide at the top. Therewere about thirty German police and S.S. men and a group of Jews stripped tothe waist, who had been brought along to bury the dead. The cars stopped about110 yards away from the grave, and the drivers who were also the executioners connected the gas apparatus and got out of the lorries. Both drivers were S.S.men in uniform. The screams and cries of the unfortunate victims were thenheard as they banged in frenzy upon the sides of the lorries. After 15 minuteshad elapsed, however, all was quiet.&quot;&apos;Mass murders of civilian population in Russian territory occupied by theenemy have become so much a matter of common knowledge that it will suffice to give a few instances only to show how ruthlessly and completely the germans have contravened the provisions of the Convention quoted above. To take one area alone, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, Russians, Jews, Moldaviansand peaceful citizens of other nationalities were murdered in Ukrainian towns.In Kharkov alone during the first days of the occupation, the Germans executed14,000 persons. In the Ukrainian capital of Kiev in a few days the Germanskilled and mutilated 52,000 men, women, old people and children. The Germansdealt mercilessly with all the Ukrainians. Russians and Jews who showed loyalty to the Soviet authorities. Into the Jewish cemetery in Kiev a large number of jews were driven, including women and children of all ages. They Avere split up into groups and forced to lie doAvn at the bottom of the pit, after which they were shot and subsequently covered with earth. In Lwow not less than 6,000 peopleAvere shot. In Odessa more than 8,000. In Kamenetz-Podolsk about 8,500 were shot or hanged. In Dnepropetrovsk more than 10,500 persons were machine-gunned. In Mariupol more than 3,000 local inhabitants were shot, amongst themmany old men, Avomen and children who had been robbed and stripped of theirclothes.   There are figures of the same order for Kerch, Rostov and other towns.The circumstances of outrage against the honour of women and organisedrape, often followed by the murder of the victims, are too bestial to be chronicledhere, but they are well authenticated and recorded in detail by the Soviet Govern -ment. When, during last winter, the enemy retreated before the Russian Armymany thousands of Soviet women, children and old men perished from cold andstarvation in open fields and woods into Avhich they were driA^en by the Germaninvaders. The list of mass murders by the occupying troops is endless. Childrenwere beaten up before the eyes of their parents, parents in the presence ofchildren. Man-hunts were staged. People were killed by grenades, bursts of machine-gun fire, or burnt at the stake or buried alive. Water was poured overthem in frost, which converted them into pillars of ice. Thousands of urbanresidents Avere shot and whole village populations exterminated. To take asingle illustration.   On the 7th January, 1942, 110 peaceful residents of the
village of Pobuzh in the Kozelsk district of the Smolensk region, nine old men,51 women and 50 children were put to death. The Germans slashed them withknives, stabbed them with bayonets, showered them with grenades, shot themwith machine-guns and automatic rifles. According to a report dated the15th March, 1942, after similar massacres of peasants in the village of Lykovoin the Orel region, out of 730 peaceful inhabitants only 50 survived. In the villages of the Lotoshino district in Moscow region, the Germans burned alive13 families of collective farmers, tortured to death and hanged 153 men andwomen collective farmers and shot 507 persons including many women and children. In the town of Novozybkov, in one night, the invaders killed380 families comprising over 1,000 old men. women, boys and girls and burnedalive dozens of children. A catalogue of these atrocities could be extendedalmost indefinitely, but the above instances afford a fair picture of the whole,and make it plain that the horrors which have been perpetrated in violation ofthe Convention could not have taken place or continued without the authority and approval of the highest German authorities.The horrors perpetrated in Russia contrary to the Hague Convention wereparalleled by similar atrocities in Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, Norway andother countries. These facts make it clear that the callous and brutal disregard of the most elementary standards of behaviour have been organised by theGerman High Command for the purpose of terrorising the peoples of the occupied territories. After such a record of wanton repudiation of their solemnagreement, it is hardly necessary to refer to their less shocking violations. It is,however, to be noted that in Poland Polish Law and administration weresuppressed in the annexed territories as early as April 1940 and, for example,compulsory German military service was introduced. This is in direct violation of Article 23 of the Hague Convention. Apart from mass murders, there were many collective penalties in violation of Article 50. Many villages were burntby way of punishment. Many executions took place as a result of condemnationsby military or special tribunals. There was, for example, a law of the Governor-General of the 13th April, 1940, imposing the death penalty for stealing woodfrom forests after nightfall. It is estimated that up to the end of 1940,1^ million inhabitants of the annexed territories had been deported and this involved expropriation. An order of the Governor-General of the 26th October,1940, introduced compulsory labour for all Poles of either sex from 14 to 60,for the benefit and at the orders of the occupying authorities. There is, inaddition, abundant evidence of interference with religious freedom and destruc-tion of churches (see Articles 46 and 56), of vandalism and sacrilege. Many ofthe clergy were tortured and shot: 630 out of 650 ecclesiastics in PolishPomerania have suffered ill-treatment at the hands of the enemy. Works of artwere seized under the authority of orders on the 16th December, 1939, and the15th January, 1940. Many of these were sent to Germany. Many were destroyed. Libraries were burnt. This is organised pillage. There has beena systematic attempt to destroy Polish culture (see Articles 46 and 56). primary schools were reopened in October 1939 but many in Warsaw were closed again in January 1940. The Secondary schools are in German hands. The Universitieshave been closed. No printing or publication is allowed except with specialauthorisation. On the 6th November, 1939, 179 Professors of Cracow Universitywere arrested and taken to Oranienburg. Seventeen died as a result; 62 are stillthere.H. Conclusion.His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Governments of our Allies are keepinga&apos; detailed record of enemy atrocities and breaches of the Conventions. Theincidents quoted above are only a selection from a mass of well-documentedmaterial. They are enough, however, to show that in attacks on merchantshipping, on hospitals and on hospital ships, in abuse of the Red Cross, in treat-ment of prisoners of war, and in the administration of occupied territories, theenemy have shown a disregard, both brutal and cynical, for the international conventions to which they pledged themselves, and an inhumanity for which eventotal war provides no shadow of justification.F R.
