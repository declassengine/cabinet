DOCULIEKTS CONCERNING THE MALTREATMENT OP GERioAN PRISONERS BY THE BRITISH.STATEMENT BY THE HIGH COiilAND 0? THE ARMED FORCES Oil THE BRITISHEXPLANATIONS.Berlin:   With reference to the profusion of statements made in the last few days &quot;by the British Prime Minister or &quot;by the British Government, the high command of the Armed Forces announces:(l)   At the landing attempted by the English at Dieppe on the 19th August,1942, the British operational order for this so-called &quot;Enterprise Jubilee&quot;, lib aaioce:other things, fallen into the hands of the German armed forces.In appendix L, paragraph A, number b2, it is stated:&quot;Wherever it is possible, the prisoners have their hands bound so thatthey cannot destroy their papers.&quot;In the statement of the British Government of the 10th October, 1942,which, was circulated by Reuter the existence of this order is not denied, but itis said that it was &quot;issued without authority&quot;.An explanation as stupid as it is incredible, since it is not to beassumed that the erders for an enterprise of which the British Government had letit be known that the preparations for it had been made over a period of ten months should not have been known to the British War Office and thus to the BritishGovernment.In reply to this order concerning captures the High Command of the Armed.Forces on the 2nd September, 1942, made the. following annovuicement:&quot;The British order captured at Dieppe states in appendix L, paragraph 4,number b2:  &apos;Wherever it is possible, the prisoners have their hands bound so thatthey cannot destroy their papers.*     In the official description of the High command of&quot; the Armed Forces of the 30th August, 1942, this section, among others, of theBritish operational order was published.The English Government did not define its attitude to this.     The GormanHigh Command has therefore ordered that all the British officers and men taken prisoner at Dieppe will be placed in fetters -as from 14.00 on the 3rd September.The reason for this- treatment lias been made known to the prisoners.     This measure will be cancelled only when the British Government in an official pronouncementwithdraws the instruction on.the fettering of German prisoners given in the ordermentioned above.The Gorman High-Command declares further that all future Wild Westmethods of &quot;his kind which amount to disgrace and disrespect for gallant soldiers      *are answered immediately with the sharpest reprisals.Tho German troops have up. to, now - as proved by many photographs taken .at Dieppe - treated, and taken care ofthe captvirod British soldiers as. decentopponents*     It is left to the British Government to judge whether this change inthe treatment of prisoners after the experiences of Dieppe which was caused by itwill affect more German or British prisoners.&quot;The British War Office at the time hastoned to deal with this ,throat,for as early as in the evening of the 2nd September, 1942, tho following statement*f the British War Office was circulated by Reutcr;:&quot;Tho German High Command communique has stated that tho English, in thecase of the Dieppo enterprise, issued orders to tho effect that prisoners shouldhave their hands tied, in order to prevent thorn from destroying their papers.Investigations into the question whether or not such orders had actually boonissuod, wore made,It is emphatically denied that any Gorman prisoner has had his handstied. &apos; &quot;Any such order, if ovc r issuod, will be countermanded.&quot;
-2-Truating the sincerity of this statement, the High&apos; Command of the armed forces withdrew the meosures against the British prisoners of war, announced on 2nd September, 1942, at noon, even before they were carried out.The already mentioned statement of the British Government of 10th Octooe:1942, now explains that the said announcement made in the evening of the 2nd Septet1942, had been issued before there was any time for investigation.   The Government,as it were, was of the opinion that such orders might convey the impression that,without regard to circumstances obtaining, the hands of prisoners of war should be tied. The English Government added in its statement of 10th October, 1942:    &quot;the investigation completed, no proof was found that any of the prisoners brought back from Dieppe had had his hands bound..&apos; &apos; : However, the existence of the mentioned ordt.was brought, to light, and it was countemanded.&quot;     The. statement of the British ?ar[Office, .&apos;-issued on 7th October, 1942, 21.00, goes still farther.     It says:&quot;All : 2rman prisoners of war which were brought to the United Kingdom, were!interrogated and stated unanimously, that they were not bound by the hands and thatlthey were humanely treated. The proof given by the enemy rests with his statements!for which there is no evidence.&quot;Both these statements - both that issued by the British War Office and tha^of the British Government - constitute a deliberate falsification of facts such asthey have meanwhile been proved.The High Command of the Armed Forces in its declaration- of the 7th October]1942 merely stated   that German soldiers and members of the Organisation Todt whohad been temporarily made prisoners by the British and later freed had been fettered]and that evidence for this were in its possession. &apos; What had happened to the GerEaBJprisoners who had been brought to England was outside the knowledge of the high command of the Armed Forces and remains to be investigated -through the protecting power.After the statement by the British War Office of the 2nd September in whichit was emphatically denied that any German prisoner had his hands bound, the high command of the Armed Forces let itself be induced, not to carry out the fettering ofBritish prisoners, that had been threatened as a reprisal..;-  However, this statement!of the British War Office of the 2nd September, 1942 was a lie.   .&quot;.; The High Command of the Armed Forces meanwhile received with reference to-the many cases, of fettering which occurred at Dieppe not only shocking photographsOf the tailor Starke of the Organisation Todt who, still in fetters, was found dead,]but many statements made on -oath and in due order before a military judge (Kriegs-gerichtsrat) by soldiers and labour-soldiers of the Organisation. Todt who werefettered for periods of between 1Q- minutes and 1-g- hours.     Only some of these statements will be quoted below.     They show at the same time in which incredibly.^rude way the fettering was carried out.(i) The then corporal (now lance-sergeant) Kurt Huber stated:&apos;&quot;I fell into English captivity-on the beach of Dieppe near the Casino...iv be estimated that about half an hour had passed when the Englishmen began toSter us.     I had.the hands.bound together on the back, in such a way that the[ were cross-like placed on each other. .,  Lance-sergeant Mueller was also-ed although he had a slight injury&apos; on one arm.     The fettering was done in such that his two thumbs were^bound together on the back.     The other soldiers were-ed in the same way as&apos; I..,. &quot;    (Dots by D.N.B. ).(2) The corporal Albert Do err&apos;said in his statement:&quot;On the meadow on to which we,&apos; too, were led, several OT (Organisation Todt)jsre lying.       They were all fettered.     The men whom I saw were all fettered ini way that the hands were tied together on the back.     Da front.of me there wasa nan-of the Organisation Todt,     His hands were&apos; bound on his back in such a wajjoth his thumbs were tied together.     From these tied hands a rope led to his,1 such a way that this rope wasTaid in front of the neck and went behind-alcM]*s back where it was tied to the hands.     The result of this binding was that5 hands and arms tired the rope round the neck was drawn downwards so that th l\ man could not breathe.....&quot;
(3) Rifleman Johann Schulz was bound in a very similar way. His statement, made under oath, says on this point:

"My hands were tied behind my back rather tightly. Apart from this a rope was bound round my neck and led backwards to my hands. When walking I had to hold my head high so as to be able to breathe. In this manner I was tied for some one hour and a half...."

Together with Schulz, Rifleman Meyer had also been made prisoner but they had lost sight of each other. After he had been freed again Schulz - as he stated under oath - "found rifleman Meyer bound on the beach, the next day. He was dead. His hands were tied behind his back. He, too, had a loop round his neck which was linked with the hands tied on his back. He was fettered in exactly the way I had been."

(4) The labour-soldier (Arbeitssoldat) of the Organisation Todt, Fritz Garrecht, stated under oath:

"On the 19th of August I, too, was temporarily an English prisoner. Together with the men of the Organisation Todt Andreas Matheiss and Jacob Moster, I was captured by the English. We had to kneel down, then our hands were bound in front of us in such a way, that the thumbs, middle and little fingers of both hands were tied together and that the cord was then wound round the wrist. In this condition I remained fettered for one to two hours. My two comrades had the fetters removed somewhat earlier. They were to carry a wounded man. I had to carry in a bag the things which had been taken from us, the bag was laid around my Arms".

(5) To the comrades of Garrecht who were to move a wounded Englishman to the beach belonged also a labour soldier of the Organisation Todt, Andreas Matheiss. He stated on oath i.e.

(6) When we went back with the wounded Englishman, I saw our tailor lying dead on the wayside. His hands were loosely fettered. He had a wound at the lower chin of which I assumed that it resulted from a stab. But I cannot of course say so with certainty.

Beside Matheiss and some other OT (Organisation Todt) men the labour-soldier of the Organisation Todt, Josef Boellinger, also saw the dead tailor Starke. Boellinger made on oath the following statement to this point

"I myself have not been in English captivity. On the 19th August 1942, about evening, our "Frontfuehrer" Reinhardt told me that we were to fetch the tailor Starke who was on the path above. When we came to him we found Starke lying dead on the wayside. His hands were fettered in front. The fists were clenched together. Between the hands were a little latitude. He had rather a big wound on the body. I cannot say for certain whether it was a bullet wound or a wound from a stab. He also had a wound on the other side of the abdomen. Futhermore he had injuries on the lower chin. It looked like a wound from a stab, but I cannot say for certain whether it was one".

If sofar, the English Government believed the German statements concerning the bindings at Dieppe to be short of proof, the statements made in Court, which are herewith published, should well be sufficient. In spite of this the Reich Government permitted the statements quoted and others which are still available in addition to the above-mentioned ones, to be checked up by renewed interrogations of those concerned through the protecting power.

As already mentioned before, the English Government assorted in its statement of 10th October 1942, that the orders given for Dieppe concerning the binding of prisoners had been rescinded on the basis of the investigation made at that time. Since the Dieppe operation had long ago been completed this statement can only mean anything, if it is taken to refer to the future.

(2) However, the fresh experiences made during the (last) (Note, this word withdrawn by DNB) English descent (Ueberfall) on the island of Sark on the 4.10.1942, have proved that the assurance that the rescinding of the order to bind prisoners, the existence of which was first doubted, represents either another untruth or is not being complied with owing to the lack of discipline among the English troops. For during the operation against Sark too, the
English have again fettered all five German prisoners. This results ? from the statements, made under oath to a military judge (?) by the two sapper lance corporals (Pioniergefeiton) Klotz and Just, who got away alive. Each of these five sappers had been attacked at night by two Englishmen, and forced to go with them without being permitted to dress before. On the fettering the Lance Corporal Klotz stated under oath:

"After this, one of the soldiers tied my hands in the region of the wrist with a thin, very strong rope. Dressed only in my shirt I was then led into the corridor of the hut. (Barracke). On this occasion I saw that lance sergeant Bleyer and Lance Corporal Esslinger were also led fettered out of their rooms.

Later, after I had freed myself from captivity, I had a look at the way in which Lance Corporal Esslinger was fettered. He was lying on the ground, his hands still fettered. He was injured. I cut through his fetters. I noticed that the way of fettering was different in his case, since the rope was several times drawn through between his hands so that it was apparently more difficult for him to break his fetters."

The statement, made under oath by Lance Corporal Just contains the following passages:

"The two English soldiers explained to me with signs that I was to be fettered, and put a rope crosswise with six double turns around both wrists. The cord was plaited. I still possess a piece of it. When they had finished fettering me. Lance sergeant Bleyer came fettered into my room and sat down on the bed in order to put on his stockings. This also was not permitted. He was pushed out of the room. Lance Sergeant Bleyer was fettered in exactly the same way as I was. Outside I attempted to burst my fetters. But I did not succeed in this because of this crosswise tying".

Both this criminal incident on the island of Sark and the subsequent enquiries after the landing attempt at Dieppe have thus proved beyond doubt that the British War Office made two false statements on the 2nd September, 1942, when it "denied emphatically that any German prisoner had his hands tied"

and assured that "any order of this kind if it should have been issued will be countermanded".

Consequently, the High Command of the Armed Forces saw itself compelled to make on the 7th October, 1942, the following announcement in a broadcast declaration, after short indication of the evidence reproduced here at length:

(1) As from 12 o&apos;clock noon on the 8th October all British officers and men captured at Dieppe will be fettered. This measure will remain in force until the British War Office gives evidence that in future it will make truthful statements on the fettering of Germans prisoners of war or that it will make sure that its orders are enforced with the troops.

(2) In future all terrorist and sabotage troops of the British and their confederates who behave not like soldiers but like bandits, will be treated as such by the German troops and wherever they appear will be mercilessly killed in the fighting."

Since the British War Office was not willing to issue satisfactory statements on this point, 107 officers and 1269 men of the prisoners taken at Dieppe were put into fetters on the 8.10.1942.

In the case of Sark the English Government has, it is true, admitted in a broadcast statement, that the five German soldiers were fettered but said that this had only been done "so that the men who took them prisoner could lead them off by passing their arms through those of the prisoners." The statement then continues:

"The prisoners, on their way to the boats had to be led past barracks occupied by the Germans and for this reason precautionary measures were necessary. In spite of these precautionary measures four or five of the German prisoner broke away, shouting aloud and had to be shot to prevent them raising the alarm".

Already on 11th October 1942 it has been pointed out in a statement to the German Press how ridiculous and self-contradictory these explanations are. The following supplementary statement is now made:

1. In the case of the two surviving sappers the English have, in any case, not made use of the possibility of passing their arms through those of the prisoners. 
have the two observed that this method was used in the case of the other prisoners. The last lines should be inset).

2. The entire way of retreat from the quarters where the sappers were attacked, to the landing place of the boats, did not lead past a single further building, let alone past a barracks occupied by the Germans! There is only one uninhabited, dilapidated house which has never been garrisoned by troops, about 100 metres north-east of the way of retreat.

Even a British Government will be unable to deny that the shouting of the German soldiers, defending themselves against the shameless treatment, was far less able to raise the alarm than was the firing of the shots by which two of the prisoners were murdered.

3. Therefore the assiduously invented reasons for the documented English attitude towards the German prisoners are mendacious; It is equally far-fetched that the British Government in its declarations of 8th and 10th October should point out, in face of the measures now taken by the Germans, that reprisals against prisoners of war are forbidden according to Article 2 of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War.

The British Government is right in so far as it points out that in the same article 2 of the so-called Geneva Convention "Humane treatment" of the prisoners of war is prescribed. But if the British Government "Humane treatment" of the prisoners of war is prescribed. But if the British Government believes that it can describe as a "controversial question" what is to be understood as humane treatment, it thereby declares at any rate its incapability of being a party of a treaty  in this sphere.

Anybody who has only a trace of decent soldierly feeling must admit that the treatment of the German prisoners at Dieppe and on Sark as described, is a mockery at all humanity and a soldierly conception of, honour and a gross violation of the most primitive rights of soldiers. The English people, therefore, are those who have made themselves guilty of grave offences against the Geneva Convention regarding prisoners of war. Nor can the justification of the English procedure by an entirely arbitrary and devious interpretation of the Geneva Convention which the English Prime Minister, Churchill, attempted in the House of Commons, make the slightest difference. His attempt to represent as an offence against the convention the fact that the German armed forces have not allowed the illegal procedure of England against the German prisoners of war to pass without acting upon it, is just as arbitrary and devious.

From the point of international law the following is decisive: At the head of the Geneva Convention stands as guiding principle the obligation to treat prisoners of war always humanely and to respect their honour as soldiers. If a belligerent Power, as the English have done at Dieppe and Sark with German prisoners of war, violates principles of the Convention, it cannot itself quote the same principle in its own favour and demand that the opponent should make no alteration in the treatment of prisoners of war in his hands. To interpret the Convention, as that gentleman Churchill does - namely that the adversary of a belligerent power must acquiesce even in actions contrary to international law, taken by the other power against the prisoners of war it holds - would lead the entire Geneva Convention ad absurdum. In such a case, the English Government could, for instance, claim the right to let German prisoners of war starve to death, whereas, according to Mr. Churchill&apos;s interpretation, the German Government would, nevertheless, remain obliged not to allow any change in the provisioning of English prisoners of war. This characterises sufficiently the attitude of the British at Dieppe and on Sark.

4. This attitude is up to the "standard " of innumerable gross infringements of the British against the simplest and most natural commandments of respect for human beings and against the basic rules of the international law of warfare. Some of the most serious cases are now to be submitted to the public, in order to complete the picture of the methods of English warfare.

A document among the booty on "Explosives", demolitions, technical instructions, traps and mines" contains extensive service instructions for sappers on the use of explosives and mines.

On page 28 there is the following note:

"To take one or two prisoners of war along with the search parties is a considerable asset and may render valuable services for the finding of hidden explosive charges."

This order for the sending forward of prisoners for the removal of mines is a clear documentary proof for not only the toleration but indeed the ordering of a particularly grave offence against the law concerning prisoners of war.

In innumerable case shots have been fired at soldiers in distress at sea.
Cr.3ea of -chic kind have occurred again and again particularly on route to Crete, andthey wore so frequent that those cases of shooting cannot &quot;be isolated cases of offences &quot;by subordinate quarters, but hawe again taken place at the command of highBritish service authorities,also responsible for thesewealth of material:Those high British military quarters arc thereforevcr crimes,     Throe cases only may be chosen from tho(11On 22nd IZag, 1941, a two-mast fishing beat with about 80 men on board en route for Crete was shot at from a distance of about l^O to 200 metres with cannonsand machine-guns by four English war chips although in vicv: of the impossibility of defence the v;hitc flag had been hoisted.     At least 20 men on boax-d v;erehilled by this action alone.     The English continued fir in;; &quot;&quot;hen the remainingpeople tried to save themselves in the water.     All those swimming were killedwith the exception of 22 men.   A3 they had life jackets and thewasmo otamirror, nobody need have been drowned but for this shooting.(2) Duringing tho night of 22/23 Kay, I34I, a motor sailing ship to Crete, was attache:&quot; and fired at by si:; English units.dinghy^ which was picked up by a searchlight and then fired aton her way from Piraeus]The crew took to a-billory and machine gang.(3) The most -monstrous case of this kind is the sinking on 12th May, 134-*-&apos; 0^ &quot;^1Cmotor sailing boat Osia ?-raskovi of 35 tons on her way from the island of Loanoato Cavalla. Sworn ovi3.eri.ee of the survivors of the Greek crew (Captain and fivemen) is on record and this is what it reveals:(I1TSEHE xwhite sheTho Genoaofficer wshot atwith /land3 0 .Apart from the Greek crowdy; there wore on board one German office.:, one IT.CO.0 men.

For all thesehappenings the Gorman Soich loverrmcnt possesses irrefutable proof in tho consularfiles which wore found on Crete.! IIIIn the course of the fighting on Crete which lasted ^for only ton days, it &quot;was notonly the insurgents who raged, but in association -with thorn Englishmen, Australiansand Now Zealanders also again and again ruthlessly disregarded the basic commands ofwar law, behaving thorns elves not like soldiers&quot;but like convicts.The details about all of whifh sworn statements have been recorded, are in partsso outrageous and horrible that it has 00 far not boon possible to make them public.At any &quot;rate there are so many ce.so3 that evidence on them fills a stately printedvolume.6,        In tho course of the attack of the German-Italian Panr-,or Army on 4&quot;th Jane, 19$]tho &quot;standing orders&quot; of tho 4th English Armoured Brigade wore captured.     This i&apos;Swhat is stated on tho treatment of prisoners of war in Section 26:&apos;&apos;The interrogation of prisoners is an extremely valuable source of information,in particular when it takes place at a time at which the prisoner in questionis still shaken and has not quite regained his normal mental state.     the prisoners is to bo granted neither food, sloop or drink nor any kindness orcomfort.     All conversation is prohibtcd until competent quarters have complete^
The Interrogation."



The British Government, it is true, outwardly disavowed also this order rapidly before the counter-measures, threatened by the German High Command on 5th June, 1942, became effective, and declared:

"Immediate steps were taken to make investigations and to countermand orders of this kind, should it have been issued by a subordinate command without authorisation. Precise instructions have been given in order that the Axis prisoners of war are treated in strict agreement with the regulations contained in the Geneva Convention."

71. Finally, the following instance of the criminal English fighting methods deserves to be made public:

At the end of December, 1941, a (one word missing in transmission), trained in London, landed from the air in the wider vicinity of Copenhagen, but was fatally injured because the parachute had not opered in the regular way. The examination of the dead man showed that under the flying suit he carried the typical gun of a ganster in a bolt. The peculiarity was that the owner, by using his hand, can shoot in every position by operating  a special Bowden wire hidden under the sleeve.

The purpose for which this arrangement is intended is obvious. It is to kill off from very close quarters anyone who tries to arrest the bearer in a treacherous manner while simulating surrender by raising the hands; for this contraption makes it possible to shoot with either hands raised, put behind the head or put on the back, or with raised arms.

These examples out of the wealth of available material are meant to prove:-

(1) That the British fighting methods uniformly in all theatres of war are running counter to the international agreements and general rules of war law

(2) That the British War Office promised twice under the pressure of the reprisals threatened by Germany to be willing to cancel orders which are contrary to international law, but it does not hesitate to operate only with fabricated declarations in order to avoid German reprisals and yet to use the same barbaric methods for the treatment of German prisoners on the next occasion.



THESE ALONE ARE THE REASONS WHICH HAVE CAUSED THE HIGH COMMAND ON THE ARMED FORCES THIS TIME TO WAKE REPRISALS. FOR IS I UNDER MY OBLIGATION TOWARDS THE GERMAN PEOPLE NOT ONLY TO PROTECT THE HONOUR OF ITS SOLDIERS BUT ABOVE ALL TO ENFORCE A HUMANE TREATMENT OF GERMAN PRISONERS BY AN OPPONENT WHO COMPLETELY LACKS THE FEELING FOR ANY HUMANE, NOT TO SPEAK OF HONOURABLE TREATMENT OF CAPTURED SOLDIERS.

 In view of these German counter-measures the English radio announced at 15 o&apos;clock, on the 9th October, 1942, over the transmitter Daventry:

"In London it is being considered that the English Government will regard all prisoners of the Axis Powers under the same angle and make no difference between Italian and German prisoners."

IN VIEW OF THIS NEWS WHICH THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT HAS HAD CIRCULATED BY THE RADIO. THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT SEES CAUSE TO REGARD ON THEIR PART PRISONERS OF WAR TAKEN FROM THE ALLIED ENEMIES ON ALL FRONTS AS A WHOLE. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PRISONERS BROUGHT IN BY GERMANY WILL FROM NOW ONWARDS HAVE TO ATONE FOR ILLEGAL OR INHUMAN TREATMENT OF GERMAN PRISONERS OF WAR IN ANY THEATRE OF WAR, E.G. ALSO IN SOVIET RUSSIA. - H D -
