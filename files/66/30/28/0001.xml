(42) 498.November 16, 1942.WAR CABINET. /DEMOBILISATION AND RESETTLEMENT.Memorandum by the Paymaster-General.ON behalf of the Committee on Reconstruction Problems, I submit: (1) the Second Interim Report of the Official Committee on Post-WarInternal Economic Problems, on the general o^uestion of &quot;the demobilisation and Resettlement of Labour &quot; (pages 34-51 below);(2) the Interim and Final Reports of the Inter-departmental Committee onthe Machinery of Demobilisation (pages 4-33 below) .I.-THE DEMOBILISATION AND RESETTLEMENT OF LABOUR.2. In their First Interim Report, now before the War Cabinet (Appendix IIto W.P. (42) 347), the Official Committee on Internal Economic Problems pointedout that one of the major problems of the post-war transitional period was thetransfer of resources, both human and material, from war to peace-timeemployment. The Second Interim Report deals with the general labour aspectsof this transfer as affecting members of the Forces, Civil Defence workers and civilian workers. It is recognised that the transfer of labour resources is dependent upon, and must proceed concurrently with, a similar change-over inthe industrial machine, and discussions with various industries are being carriedon by the Departments concerned. The Reconstruction Problems Committee have asked that these discussions and the promised further report on the industrialaspects of demobilisation and resettlement should be expedited.3. The present Report is concerned in the first place with the general principles on which the demobilisation and resettlement of labour should proceed.While there is reason to expect some years of good employment supervening onthe change-over from war to peace, the change-over itself may be a period of far greater dislocation with heavier unemployment than the corresponding period after the last war. An attempt to reduce this unemployment by deliberatelyprolonging the process of demobilisation, both military and civil, is likely to be attended with very great difficulties and to delay the process of industrialreadjustment. The Official Committee reach the conclusion that the national interest will best be served (i) by letting military demobilisation proceed as rapidly as Service needs,transport and the machinery of discharge will permit;(ii) by not attempting to hold civilian workers for whom continuing employ-ment is not available;(iii) by controlling, where possible, the rate of execution of war contracts with a view to the orderly conversion of industry to peace-time production.4. The Committee envisage the desirability of continuing .&quot; for a timemany of the existing controls over the importation, distribution and prices of essential materials, over foreign exchange, over capital investment and overactual production and supply. Much influence can be exerted in this way overthe post-war distribution of labour without raising the serious issues, both political and economic, that would be involved in any attempt to continue afterthe War the powers of industrial conscription at present vested in the Ministryof Labour and National Service. ...[24572] - bPrinted for the War Cabinet,   ft or ember 1942.
&quot; Finally, in view of the possibility that the change-over in industry may be attended with considerable unemployment, it is of the highest importance thatthe public should be fully prepared for this contingency, informed as to the causes and as to the probability of its lasting only a short time, and given good ground for confidently expecting thereafter years of good employment. In our view, itis not too early even now to begin this process.&quot;5. The Reconstruction Problems Committee submit these conclusions forthe approval of the War Cabinet as the general basis of our demobilisation and resettlement policy.6. As regards specific action the Official Committee recommend that, inaddition to the measures to be proposed later for speeding up the provision ofemployment, steps should be taken : (a) during the War as soon as the general situation makes it practicable andtimely :(i) to set up a Committee to decide the criteria to be adopted in granting prior release to special categories and individualswhere this is essential to a rapid revival of peace-time production;(ii) to consult  the  British  Employers&apos;   Confederation  and  theTrades Union Congress as to action to be taken to clear up theconfusion in regard to rights of &quot; reinstatement. &quot;;(iii) to formulate Government policy in regard to any preference inemployment to be granted to ex-Service personnel;(iv) to take measures to provide for the essential housing needs ofthose who will be engaged in post-war production;(b) after the end of hostilities (i) to give as early release as possible to men and groups determined under (a) (i) above;(ii) to provide training &amp;c, for ex-Service men and civilian workersnecessary to fit them to take their place in industry.The War Cabinet are asked to agree that the Departments respectivelyconcerned should proceed accordingly subject to the submission for War cabinet approval in due course of the policy to be followed under (a) (ii) and (iii).II.-THE REPORTS ON THE MACHINERY OF DEMOBILISATION.7. Demobilisation after the last War was planned on the basis of releaseas employment became available, but owing to abuse and to its inherent unfairnessthe scheme broke down. On this occasion the Inter-departmental Committee(including representatives of all three Services and the Ministry of Labour and national Service) recommend that demobilisation of all ranks, both men andwomen, should proceed, subject to the prior demands of the Services, by groupsaccording to a combination of age and length of service in the present War. the precise definition of the groups is left until nearer the end of the War, but theCommittee give an illustration of possible grouping based on counting six monthsof service as equivalent to five years of age.  Thus men of 45-50 with 12 to 18 months&apos; servicemen of 40-45 with 18 to 24 months&apos; serviceand so on down to men of up to 25 with 42-48 months&apos; service would be demobilised together.8. The operation of this basis is, however, to be subject to the immediaterelease of men in special priority classes of such limited dimensions as not to-endanger the main scheme, e.g.: (a) individuals or industrial groups and occupations vitally needed for reconstruction;(b) returned prisoners of war and internees;(c) those qualifying on grounds of extreme compassion for domestic or business hardship;(a) married women.
9. Where demobilisation of any group is being spread over any length oftime, priority within the group is to be accorded, by Commanding Officers, acting under broad general instructions, to include (a) industrial groups and occupational classes of importance to industryother than 8 (a) above;(b) individuals who have a guarantee of employment;(c) married men.10. The Committee&apos;s Report includes recommendations as to repatriation ofpersons normally resident abroad, demobilisation abroad, the calculation ofservice and other matters of detailed administration, stressing the desirabilityof placing &quot; upon some body such as the Chiefs of Staffs Committee the duty of suggestingto the War Cabinet at the appropriate moment the issue of a preliminarywarning to all Departments to complete their preparations for demobilisation.&quot;11. They conclude by urging that the success of the scheme will depend upon&quot; the fulfilment of three conditions : (a) That all possible steps are taken, by training and otherwise, to assistmen and women released from the Forces in finding suitable employ-ment as soon as possible.(b) That the policy of the Government, both internal and external, is directed to the provision of full employment, so that men and womenretained in the Forces under our scheme of priorities will not be placed at a serious disadvantage in comparison with those released early fromthe Forces, from Civil Defence and from war industries.(c) That the scheme of demobilisation and the general resettlement policy ofthe Government are fully explained in good time to the personnel ofthe Forces and to the general public, every form of publicity andpersuasion being employed to secure general acceptance.&quot;12. The Reconstruction Problems Committee have examined these Reports,and, subject to possible second thoughts by the War Office on one point, theyapprove the recommendations. The House of Commons is aware that a report has been received, and the Committee think that I should make some referenceto the subject in the course of my general statement in the debate on the Address.Any detailed discussion at the present time is, of course, to be deprecated andwe do not contemplate immediate publication. I propose merely to say that a plan has been drawn up which provides, subject to military needs, for an orderlydischarge from the Forces based in the main on age and length of service, butnot to be drawn into any detailed discussion. While it may no doubt be advisableat a later date to give opportunities for discussion and possibly in the light of itto.make some adjustments in the details of the scheme, we are satisfied that themain lines of the scheme are sound.13.   The War Cabinet are asked to agree :-(i) that a statement on these lines should be made during the debate onthe Address in the course of any general survey of reconstruction;(ii) that the Departments concerned should, without any detailed publicity for the present, proceed with any necessary preparatory measures onthe general lines of the Reports;(iii) that the chiefs of Staff Committee be given the responsibility for initiating the action indicated in paragraph 10 above.W.

[R.P. (41) 13.]May 22, 1941.WAR CABINET.Committee on Reconstruction Problems.INTER-DEPARTMENTAL  COMMITTEE ON THE  MACHINERY OFDEMOBILISATION.Interim Report.Minister without Portfolio.IN January 1941 you set up an Inter-Departmental Committee, consistingof representatives of yourself, the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary ofState for War, the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of Labour and national Service, with the following terms of reference : &quot;To consider what machinery is necessary for securing thatdemobilisation can be effected according to an orderly system of priorities and what action should be taken now to secure that such machinery will bein working order when required.&quot;2.   The Committee was constituted as follows :-War Cabinet Offices (Chairman) Sir George Chrystal.Admiralty *Captain R. H. V. Buxton, R.N.Mr. G. Dunn.War Office-Brigadier G. E. H. Sim.Mr. L. A. Munro.Air Ministry Air Commodore J. W. Cordingley.Wing Commander S. J. Bailey.Ministry of Labour and National Service Mr. J. S. Nicholson.Mr. V. A. Goddard.War Cabinet Offices Mr. S. B. R. Cooke.Ministry of Labour and National Service (Secretary) Mr. G. W. J. Cole.3. The Committee has held eleven meetings and is now in a position topresent an interim Report.4. We have not so far given other than incidental consideration to the demobilisation of officers. This subject and also the demobilisation of theWomen&apos;s Auxiliary Forces constitute distinct problems which we propose to dealwith in a later Report.* Since the 22nd April, 1941, Captain A. B. Greig, R.N., has represented the First Lord ofthe Admiralty in place of Captain R. H. V. Buxton, R.N.
5.   We have addressed ourselves primarily to the following tasks : A. To consider whether the information available to the Government aboutpersons serving with the Armed Forces is adequate for the purposesof any scheme of demobilisation which is reasonably likely to beadopted.B. To devise a general scheme of demobilisation which, while satisfying the broad requirements of-equity, is sufficiently flexible to enable provision to be made for the early release of persons to whom the Governmentdecides to give special priority of demobilisation.6. Throughout this Report we have assumed that the Government will wishto be in a position, so far as is possible, to treat sailors, soldiers and airmensimilarly in any demobilisation scheme.A. Collection and Arrangement of Information.7. We think it essential that the Government should have the means ofobtaining statistical information as to the composition of the Armed Forces whichwill enable reliable estimates to be made of the numbers who are likely to take up any particular occupation in civil life and of the numbers who are likely toreturn to any particular area on demobilisation. For this purpose we think that each Service Department should, in relation to every man in the Service, keep a record of the following facts (in addition to any other facts which may be recorded for Service purposes) : (a) The nature of his civilian occupation (if any) at the time of his entryor enlistment, and the industry in which he was employed;(b) The place in which he was domiciled at the time of his entry orenlistment;and that this record should be kept in a form in which statistical informationcan be readily abstracted from it.8. We think that the nature of a man&apos;*s civilian occupation should be recorded exactly. For instance, it will probably not be sufficient to know thata man s peace-time occupation was warehouseman. In order to determine whether he belongs to a class urgently required in civil life it may also be necessary toknow the industry in which he was employed (e.g., textiles, paper manufacture,food manufacture). We therefore think that the record should indicate both thenature of the man&apos;s civilian occupation at the time of his entry or enlistmentand the industry in which he was employed.9. General information as to the numbers of men who are likely to wishto return to particular places may well prove necessary for the purposes of any scheme for relating demobilisation to industrial requirements. If a local shortageof a particular class of labour develops in Glasgow, information may be desiredof the number of men in a particular occupation who are likely to return to Glasgow on demobilisation. In general, it may be presumed that a man will wishto return to the district in which he was domiciled at the time of his entry orenlistment. We have therefore selected forty large urban centres in the UnitedKingdom, a list of which is given in Appendix A to this Report, and we recom-mend that in the case of persons domiciled in these towns at the time of entryor enlistment, the town of domicile should be recorded. In the case of personsdomiciled elsewhere, we think that it will be sufficient to record the county ofdomicile. In the case of men domiciled abroad, we think it will be sufficient simply to record the country of domicile.10. It will also be useful for the purpose of any scheme of demobilisationto have information, in a statistical form, as to the number of men of anyparticular class who are serving in various parts of the world. The Army andAir Force Authorities are prepared to keep records which will indicate in general terms the part of the world in which each man in the Service was last known tobe serving. The records will be in a form in which they can be used for statisticalpurposes. The task of keeping such records up to date in the- case of men serving in the Navy would present formidable difficulties, and we recommend thatit should not be attempted. All three Services have alternative methods ofdiscovering the location of particular individuals.11. Hitherto the Navy and the Air Force have kept a card index recordingcertain information relating to persons in the Service.   The records containing
information as to men in the Army have been kept at Record Offices, but the WarOffice are in process of setting up a central card index. None of the service departments is yet in possession of all the information which is required bythe above recommendations in relation to the whole of its personnel, and each service Department has undertaken to conduct a census to collect the informationstill required. The results of the census will in the case of the War Office be incorporated in the central card index now in preparation. The Air Ministrypropose to institute a new index which will supplement the information which is available in their existing index. The Admiralty propose to abandon their existing index and substitute for it a comprehensive new index. Thesystem of recording information as to occupation and domicile, and the detail in )which it is recorded, will be identical in the case of all three Services. The cardindexes are kept in a form in which the information recorded may be readily-analysed for statistical purposes.12. The census of the Army is already nearly complete, and the information obtained is now being sorted and collated for transfer to the cards. TheAdmiralty and the Air Ministry are preparing plans for the necessary censusin consultation with the War Office and the Ministry of Labour and NationalService so that, as far as possible, the census may be conducted in accordancewith a uniform scheme for all Services.B. Outline of Proposed Scheme of Demobilisation.13. All schemes of demobilisation must be based on the assumption that each service concerned will have the legal power to retain its men, and any realisticscheme must envisage the possibility that we shall be compelled to maintain our armed Forces at considerable strength after the process of demobilisation hasstarted. For this purpose it may prove necessary to call up new classes of young-men while older men are being demobilised. In preparing this report we have therefore assumed that the various powers under which men can be called to andretained in the Services will remain in force throughout the period with whichwe are dealing.14.   We accept as fundamental the following two principles : (a) That the rate at which any demobilisation scheme is to proceed shouldbe so determined that the strength of each of the Services is not atany stage reduced below the numbers necessary to enable the service to perform effectively the functions required of it. It is possible toconceive of a situation in which large numbers of men might be demobilised within a comparatively short space of time, but we have felt it incumbent on us to devise a scheme which will operate satis-factorily whether the process of demobilisation is rapid or slow.(b) That in general no individual should be demobilised so long as his services are required by the Force with which he is serving.15.   Subject to these principles, we think that the essential conditions to be fulfilled by any demobilisation scheme are : (a) That it should recommend itself to the men concerned and to the general public as fair and reasonable. For this purpose and also for purposesof administrative convenience it is highly desirable that the mainoutlines of the scheme should be as simple as possible.(&amp;) That it should make ample provision for the early release of men on industrial, compassionate or other grounds. The result of theoperation of the Schedule of Reserved Occupations has so far beensuch as to retain in civil life a pool of labour capable of meeting a wide variety of post-war requirements, and for this reason it ispossible that there will be no strong pressure for the early release oflarge numbers of men on industrial grounds. We cannot, however,rely confidently on the realisation of this possibility. The framework of the scheme which we propose is, we think, sufficiently flexible toenable special priority to be given to any classes of persons in thelight of the situation existing while demobilisation is in progress.16. We think that the main factors determining a man&apos;s claim to earlydemobilisation on grounds of fairness are his age and the length of his service in the present War. We accordingly recommend that, as a basis for demobilisationarrangements, the personnel of each Service should be divided into demobilisation
groups based upon age and length of service. We propose that all persons abovean age (say 50) to be fixed by the Government before the commencement ofdemobilisation should be placed in the first group for demobilisation, and thatall other persons in the Forces should be divided into demobilisation groups on asystem of age weighted by length of service in the present War. The tablecontained in Appendix B &quot;to this Report is an illustration of the principles onwhich groups might be formed on the assumption that the War lasts for threeyears. The application of the principles on which the groups are formed willrequire modification according to the length of the War and the age distributionof the Services at the time of demobilisation, and can, of course, also be modified so as to vary the relative weight given to length of service and to age. When theplan is settled finally the manner in which it can be carried out will naturallydepend largely upon the structure and operational requirements of each of theServices. We realise that the principles which we recommend could be appliedmore completely to the demobilisation of the Army than of the other two Services,but we feel it would not be easy to defend the application of differing principles to the three Fighting Forces.17. If the scheme we suggest is adopted the size of the various demobiiisa-tion groups may vary considerably. For reasons which will appear from our recommendations as to the principles on which demobilisation should proceedwithin each group (paragraph 21) we do not think that disparity in the size ofthe groups will present any insuperable difficulty.18. It will be necessary for the purposes of this scheme to frame a definition of the expression &quot; service in the present War.&quot; It is possible that the expressionmay bear a slightly different meaning in relation to the different Services. Weare giving further consideration to this question.19. We are conscious of the difficulty of giving adequate weight both tolength of service and age. We think that the scheme proposed enables a reason-able compromise to be made between the claims of these two factors, which are tosome extent inconsistent. The representatives of the Admiralty would have pre-ferred to regard length of service, not as a factor in determining the group inwhich a man is placed for demobilisation purposes, but simply as a factorentitling a man to claim early demobilisation within the group in which he was placed on grounds of age. The Committee as a whole, however, anticipate thatthere will be very strong pressure in favour of regarding length of war service as a particularly important ground for claiming early demobilisation. Theydoubt whether the simplified scheme suggested by the Admiralty would be adequate for the purpose of meeting this pressure, and the Admiralty representa-tives have accepted this view.20. Upon this general scheme of priorities it will be possible to superimposeany special scheme of priorities which the Government may think necessary.Thus, any particular individual urgently required in civil life could be demobilised at once, whether or not his group had been reached. Again, if theGovernment decides that: (a) Men of a particular occupational class, or(b) Men of a particular occupational class above a certain age, or(c) Returned prisoners of war, or(d) Men whose retention in the Services would cause exceptional hardshipshould be demobilised forthwith, such men could be demobilised at once, notwith-standing that their group had not yet been reached. In this report we have giventhe name &quot; special priority class &quot; to a class of persons selected for demobilisationirrespective of the group to which they belong. It will be possible to put consider-able numbers of men into special priority classes without destroying the generaloutlines of the scheme which we recommend. If, however, the special priorityclasses were to become so big as to absorb all or nearly all the available quota for demobilisation at any time, as it might well do if very large Interim Forces had tobe maintained, the principle of demobilisation by age and service would breakdown altogether, with a risk of discontent arising. We wish, therefore, to recordour opinion that, if men are demobilised too freely before their group has beenreached, there will be a danger that age and length of service will not be givensufficient weight to satisfy tne demands of public opinion inside and outside theServices.
21. The men constituting each group cannot, of course, be demobilisedsimultaneously. The actual rate of demobilisation within the groups will depend (a) upon the requirements of the Services, and(6) upon such factors as the location, transport facilities, &amp;c.Where for any reason demobilisation of a group is slow, the determination of priorities within the group will assume greater importance. We propose that theactual order of priority within each group should be determined by commanding-officers in accordance with general instructions settled by the Government and issued by the Service Departments.It is at this stage, if the scheme we propose is adopted, that (apart fromspecial priority classes) claims to priority of demobilisation on grounds otherthan age and length of service will be considered. Thus, for instance, command-ing officers might be instructed to give special consideration within a group tomarried men, to men whose education or apprenticeship has been interrupted, tomen with employment awaiting them, &amp;c. The instructions issued to commanding-officers would leave scope for the exercise of a reasonable discretion. We thinkthat the discretion of commanding officers, controlled in the way we have indicated, will provide the best guarantee that each man will receive fair and reasonable treatment within the group in which he is placed.22. There will probably be a large number of men of whom it may be saidthat employment awaits them on demobilisation. For instance, Section 14 of theNational Service (Armed Forces) Act, 1939, which applies to all men called upfor service under that Act, and all men called out as members of the Reserve and auxiliary Forces, makes it obligatory upon the person by whom the man was lastemployed within fourteen days before he was called up or called out to reinstatehim in his previous employment on &quot; the termination of his service.&quot; Employersand prospective employers may wish to make application for the early release ofparticular men. Such applications are particularly likely in cases where an employer has been supplementing his employee&apos;s Service pay. Our provisionalview is that, where an employer or prospective employer applies for a man&apos;s early release, the man should have a claim to early demobilisation within the group inwhich he is placed. Subject to this, we do not think that a man should beentitled to priority of demobilisation on the ground that employment is availablefor him. We are studying further the subject of persons for whom employment is available on demobilisation, and we hope to deal with it in detail in a laterreport.23. The scheme we propose would apply to all members of the Armed Forcesexcept persons entered or enlisted on a regular engagement whose term of active,colour or regular service has not expired at the time for demobilisation. Somepersons entitled to demobilisation under the scheme may not wish to be demobilisedimmediately. Such men, if the Service authorities are willing to retain them,need not be demobilised within their group, and special arrangements should bemade for them to continue their service.24. We have examined all the considerations which we think might conceivably be put forward as affecting the priority of release of individuals or groups of Individuals and have tentatively grouped them into four categories : (a) Considerations which preclude release.(b) Considerations which would justify early release irrespective of age and service (special priority class).(c) Considerations which would justify priority of release within the age and service group into which the individual falls.(d) Considerations which should be ignored.These are set out in Appendix C. We desire, however, to emphasise thatthis classification is only tentative and must be subject to revision in accordancewith the conditions prevailing at the time of demobilisation.25. We recommend that this scheme should be adopted for all three Services.The actual operation of the scheme will, however, inevitably vary according tothe Service concerned. Thus, for instance, it cannot be assumed that the demobilisation of each Service would begin on the same date. Again, the WarOffice would probably wish to fix the same date for the demobilisation of eachage group in all units, whether the units are serving at home or overseas, subject
to military considerations and transportation facilities. It is premature to say whether such a simple rule could be adopted in the case of the Air Force. In theNayv, demobilisation must depend on the reduction of ships and services thatbecome surplus to requirements, and the return of their personnel to the Depots.The men available for demobilisation at any time will be largely fortuitous as tonumbers and composition and the possibilities of redistributing them will belimited. Generally, therefore, the age groups and other priorities will tend to operate over a smaller field than they &quot;will in the Army.26. The nature of the Service requirements which will disqualify a manfor demobilisation within his group or retard the date at which he is demobilisedwithin his group will also vary considerably. For instance, in order to providefor essential maintenance work, the Air Force may find it necessary to retain aconsiderable number of men in certain trades after men in other trades in lowerdemobilisation groups have been released. The rate at which men can be demobilised from the Army will depend on the rate at which the equipment ofdemobilised units can be disposed of and may vary in different arms and indifferent theatres of war. Until the equipment of a unit can be disposed of, itwill be necessary, as it was at the end of the last War, to retain a cadre or skeletonstaff to take charge of it. It may be necessary to retain persons required for thesecadres in the Forces after the date on which they would otherwise have beeneligible for demobilisation.27. When demobilisation begins, it may be found that the Navy and theAir Force will be in a position to demobilise men in the lower groups (i.e., youngmen who have served for a comparatively short period) at a time at which menin much higher groups are still required for service in the Army. To discharge the men in the lower groups in such circumstances might be considered as giving them an unfair priority of demobilisation, and it is necessary to contemplateprovisions (which would require legislation) for the compulsory transfer of such men to the Army.   We propose to give further consideration to this question.C. Miscellaneous Matters.28. In addition to devising the general scheme set out above, we haveaddressed ourselves to certain other problems of demobilisation, not all of whichare clearly within our terms of reference.Prisoners of War in Enemy Hands.29. We recommend that when prisoners of war are released, they shouldnot be retained in the Services unless they are serving on regular engagementswhich have not expired or volunteer and are accepted for further service.Repatriation of Persons of Dominion, Colonial and Foreign Domicile serving inthe Imperial Forces.30.   These persons fall broadly into two classes : (a) men who enlisted abroad or who were brought from abroad at theGovernments expense to enlist in the United Kingdom.(b) men who came from abroad at their own expense to enlist in the UnitedKingdom.Under the rules now in force, the former, but not the latter, would be entitledto repatriation at public expense. We are considering whether we should recommend that more generous provision for repatriation should be made, possibly,on the lines of the schemes which were in force at the end of the last War, andwe hope to present a further report on this matter.Transport A rrangements.31. Arrangements for the transport to their countries and their homes ofmen about to be demobilised must depend upon many factors (e.g., the location of the Forces and the amount of shipping available), which are incalculable at thepresent time. We therefore feel unable to make any immediate recommendation on this subject. We recognise, however, that no demobilisation scheme is completeunless proper provision has been made for transport arrangements, and we thinkthat further consideration should be given to this question when the circumstances in which demobilisation will have to be effected can be more clearly foreseen.
Training for Resettlement in Civil Life.32. An Inter-Departmental Committee has been set up under the Chairman-ship of Sir Alan Barlow to deal with certain educational aspects of resettlement.The whole question of the education and vocational training of persons discharged from the Forces will require exhaustive study. In general, the persons to beconsidered fall into two classes : (a) those whose education or vocational training has been interrupted bytheir service in the Forces; and(b) those who before entering the Forces have had no training at all, but would desire to take advantage of any facilities that may be provided.Any scheme which involves granting special priority of demobilisation to either of these classes could probably not be worked unless each Service Depart-ment were in possession of information indicating what persons were eligible for educational courses and vocational training. The system of records which wehave recommended cannot provide this information, which must necessarily comefrom the man himself or from some educational or other body interested in hisparticular case. We wish, however, to record our opinion that the criteria by.which eligibility for educational courses or vocational training can be judgedare much too vague to provide a clear definition of a class to be selected forspecial priority of demobilisation, and we would deprecate any attempt to formsuch a class unless the national interest appears clearly to require it.Measures to prevent Dissatisfaction with Demobilisation Scheme.33. We think it our duty to point out that any demobilisation scheme,however justly conceived and fairly applied, is certain to create discontent in individual cases. We think that a scheme of the type we have recommended is,on the whole, more likely to do substantial justice than any other and, therefore,to enlist the support of the men concerned and of the public at large, but wethink that every form of publicity and persuasion should be used to convince the men* concerned and the general public of its fairness. Whatever scheme ofdemobilisation is adopted, the nature of the scheme should, we think, be announced to members of each Service before the scheme is put into operation. Theannouncements to be made to the various Services will probably differ in- theirdetails and in the methods of their publication. Well-organised and accurately-timed publicity will be an essential factor in the smooth working of the schemewhich we propose, and, indeed, of any other scheme. At the end of the last. War.discontent with demobilisation arrangements was serious and widespread, andit was necessary to devise financial palliatives to reconcile those who could not be demobilised early to their fate. We have no reasons to suppose that the ratesof service pay are now a cause of serious dissatisfaction, and we hope that specialfinancial measures will not prove necessary this time. There can, however, beno certainty that this hope will be fulfilled, and it is possible that the Governmentmay find it expedient to introduce increases in service rates of pay which mayhave financial repercussions, the consideration of which is far outside the scopeof this Committee.D. Future Arrangements.34. Your Committee has thought it proper to present an interim report atthis stage in order to ascertain whether the general scheme of demobilisationwhich they envisage is such as is likely to meet with the approval of Ministers.Subject to such approval, we propose to consider further, and in due course report upon, the following subjects : (a) The demobilisation of officers (paragraph 4).\b) The demobilisation of the Womeirs Forces (paragraph 4).(c) The   meaning  of   the  expression   &quot; service   in   the   present   War&quot;(paragraph 18).(d) The machinery necessary for the early demobilisation of pivotal men.\e) The machinery,  if any,  necessary for granting special priority ofdemobilisation to persons for whom employment is waiting and to persons who are proceeding to educational or vocational training courses (paragraphs 22 and 32).(/) Possible provisions for transfer from one Service to another of young-men who have served for a short period (paragraph 27).(g) Provision for repatriation of persons of Dominion, Colonial and Foreigndomicile serving with the Forces (paragraph 30).

[R.P. (42) 33]October 9, 1942.WAR CABINET.Committee on Reconstruction Problems.INTER-DEPARTMENTAL  COMMITTEE  ON  THE  MACHINERYOF DEMOBILISATION.Final Report.To the Right Hon. Sir William Jowitt, K.C, M.P.Sir,1.   The Committee was appointed by the Minister without Portfolio inJanuary 1941, with the following terms of reference : &apos;&apos; To consider what machinery is necessary for securing that demobilisa-tion can be effected according to an orderly system of priorities and what action should be taken now to secure that such machinery will be in working order when required.&quot;2. Since it was originally appointed there have been several changes inthe membership of the Committee, its present constitution being as follows : Sir Alfred Hurst, Reconstruction Secretariat (Chairman).Admiralty Captain Lord Ailwyn, R.N.Mr. G. Dunn,Mr. P. E. Marrack.War Office-Brigadier G. E. H. Sim.Mr. L. A. Munro.Air Ministry Air Commodore J. W. Cordingley.Wing Commander S. J. Bailey.Ministry of Labour and National Service Mr. J. S. Nicholson.Mr. V. A. Goddard.Miss E. Whyte.Reconstruction Secretariat Mr. C. V. Davidge.Mrs. M. A. Hamilton.Ministry of Labour and National Service (Secretary) Mr. G. W. J. Cole.3. In considering the demobilisation and repatriation of members ofHis Majesty&apos;s Forces normally resident abroad, we have had the assistance ofrepresentatives of the Government Departments mentioned below :  Colonial Office. Flome Office.Dominions Office. India Office.Foreign Office. Ministry of War Transport.4. We have interpreted our terms of reference to cover the demobilisationfor which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will be responsible.Our Report does not extend to Forces for whose demobilisation arrangements
will be made by the Governments of the Dominions, the Colonies, India, burma and Allied countries. We have not made separate reference to the Royal Marines,regarding them as included in the Royal Navy.5. In our Interim Report presented in May 1941, we took it is axiomaticthat in general no individual was to be demobilised as long as his services were required for the Forces in the immediate post-war period the Interim Forces.We indicated, however, that in deciding who should be retained the services should, where possible, give preference to those wishing to remain with theForces over those anxious to be demobilised. We also regarded it as axiomaticthat the scheme of demobilisation should be such as would operate satisfactorilywhether the process were to be rapid or slow. Subject to these overriding con-siderations we thought it essential that the scheme should be not only fair and reasonable, but acceptable as such by all concerned, and that simplicity in its main outlines would therefore be important.6. The general basis on which we recommended that demobilisation should proceed for men in all three Services was one of dispersal by groups determinedaccording to age and length of service during the present War, the first suchgroup to consist of older men qualified by age alone (over 50 was suggested) andthe remaining groups to comprise men according to their age but weighted bylength of war service. The operation of this system was, however, to besubject to the immediate release of men in special priority classes to be deter-mined by the Government, but of such limited dimensions as not to endanger the main scheme, e.g., returned prisoners of war, men urgently needed for essential industry, either as being pivotal individuals or as being of a class withspecified qualifications, men qualifying on grounds of extreme compassion.7. Where demobilisation of any group was being spread over any lengthof time, priority within the group would be granted by commanding officersacting within certain broad general instructions.8. Subject to the approval of Ministers of the proposals in our InterimReport which was duly conveyed to us we stated therein that we proposedto report further on the following subjects :  (a) The demobilisation of officers.(b) The demobilisation of the Women&apos;s Forces.(c) The meaning of the expression &quot; service in the present War.&quot;(d) The machinery necessary for the early demobilisation of pivotal men.\e) The machinery, if any, necessary for granting special priority ofdemobilisation to persons for whom employment is waiting and to persons who are proceeding to educational or vocational training-courses.(/) Possible provisions for transfer from one Service to another of young-men who have served for a short period.(g) Provision  for repatriation of persons of Dominion,  Colonial  andForeign domicile serving with the Forces.(h) The factors entitling a man to claim early demobilisation on extremecompassionate grounds or for strong reasons of personal hardshiparising out of his business or occupation.9. We have now held forty-four meetings in all and have completedconsideration of these questions, and herewith submit our Report. Subject tothe need for referring to us any further matter connected with the machineryof demobilisation, and to any directions you may give for reconsideration ofany matter, this Report can be regarded as final.10. Our Interim Report and the next?&apos;section of this Report on the demobilisation of officers relate primarily to the male personnel of His Majesty&apos;forces. The application to the Women&apos;s Forces of the general scheme for the demobilisation of officers and other ranks is dealt with in the next following-section of this Report. Thereafter any reference to officers and men apply equally to members of the Women&apos;s Forces unless it is clear that such interpretation isnot intended.Officers. .11. In considering the scheme for demobilisation of men we regarded itas fundamental that, in general, no one should be demobilised so long as his services were required, and that, in deciding who should be retained, preference
should, where possible, be given to those wishing to remain in the Forces over those anxious to be demobilised.   The same rule should apply to officers.12. We realise, however, that Service requirements will be more exacting inregard to the demobilisation of officers than in the case of men. In general,officers are far less interchangeable than men, and greater consideration will haveto be given to their individual qualifications in determining whether they are needed for the Interim Forces. The qualifications of age and service, whichwould render a man eligible for demobilisation, are likely to be inoperative inthe case of the large number of officers who, for Service reasons, cannotimmediately be made available for demobilisation. On the other hand, thereare in each of the Services many officers engaged on special duties, the need forwhich will diminish after the cessation of hostilities. Such officers are often not qualified for general duties, and a proportion of them will therefore have to be demobilised immediately, irrespective of their position under the general rulefor demobilisation priorities,13. The selection of personnel for the Interim Forces will be the responsi-bility of the Service Departments, which will make arrangements to meet theirown special problems. These problems differ widely in the three Services and alsoin different branches of the same Service, and the arrangements will thereforediffer. In the case of other ranks, it is anticipated that in the Army it will bepossible to effect a more general sorting of personnel between units than in theother two Services, thereby making available for early demobilisation a greater proportion of those in high priority classes under the rules. In the case of officers,however, such a general sorting will in all three Services be restricted by the considerations set out in the preceding paragraph.14. In spite of the limitations imposed by the above considerations, we areof the opinion that age and service can be taken into account to a limited extent in determining which officers are to be retained for the Interim Forces and whichdemobilised. The order of demobilisation of the latter can, however, bedetermined to a far greater extent by the criteria of age and service.We therefore recommend that the principles we have proposed for determing the demobilisation priorities of men should also be adopted for officers as far as possible. The limitations on the application of those principles to officers should be made clear in any announcement.15. We have considered whether the procedure we have recommended above for the demobilisation of officers should be modified in any way in its applicationto chaplains, doctors and dentists, whose withdrawal from civil life is regulated by special schemes. Men in holy orders and regular ministers of a religiousdenomination are not liable to be called up for service under the National service acts and representative bodies of various religious denominations have been responsible for the nomination of candidates for commissions as chaplains.Members of the medical and dental professions are liable under the NationalService Acts for service but are called up for service only in their professionalcapacity. Special arrangements are in force, however, whereby the CentralMedical and Dental War Committees, representing the professions in Englandand Wales, and the corresponding Scottish Committees, advise on the applicationto doctors and to dentists of their liability to service, subject to review by theappropriate Government Departments. Recommendations of these representative bodies of religious denominations and the medical and dental professions aremade in the light of the needs of the civil population.16. Subject to the overriding needs of the Services, officers in these classesshould as far as possible be given the priority to which their age, length of serviceand their other circumstances would entitle them under the general scheme for demobilisation. Nevertheless, we think it advisable to recommend that service departments should consult with the Government Departments and theauthorities representing the religious bodies and professions concerned, so that special priority of demobilisation can be freely given to individuals whose earlydemobilisation would be in the national interest.The Women&apos;s Forces.17. The Women&apos;s Forces consist of Nursing Services, a Teaching service for the Army and large auxiliary forces for all three Services the Women&apos;royal Naval Service, the Auxiliary Territorial Service and the  Women&apos;s
Auxiliary Air Force. The Nursing Services comprise several different classes-with various conditions of service, and it is not expected that any dffieulties willbe experienced in arranging for their demobilisation when their services can be spared. The Teaching Service consists of only a comparatively small number ofwomen, who will probably continue in the Service after the War and no special arrangements for their demobilisation appear necessary. The Auxiliary forces are, however, already large and the number of women to be demobilised will eventually reach several hundreds of thousands. It is essential, therefore, thattheir demobilisation should be carefully considered and regulated.18. Although the A.T.S. and the W.A.A.F. are respectively subject to the discipline of the Army and the Royal Air Force, the W.R.N.S., which is a smaller force, is not as yet subject to naval discipline. In consequence, althoughmembers of the W.R.N.S. have engaged to serve for the period of the emergency,they cannot be held against their will, and no action of a disciplinary charactercan be taken against a member who leaves the service without permission. Itis, however, the considered view of the Admiralty that the number of members who will leave the Service in this way on the conclusion of hostilities will not be large and that the vast majority will loyally adhere to the terms of theirengagements. Nevertheless, it is assumed that the proportion of members whowill be desirous or willing to return to civil life as soon as possible will makeit necessary to apply an ordered scheme of demobilisation. Our recommendations are therefore directed to the demobilisation of the W.R.N.S., as well as theWomen&apos;s Auxiliary Services of the Army and of the Royal Air Force.19. In the case of male personnel we have accepted the fundamentalprinciple that in general no person should be demobilised so long as his services are required. We accept the same principle in regard to the demobilisation ofthe Women&apos;s Forces. There are branches in each Service in which the economicuse of man-power has demanded the extensive employment of women on certainduties previously allotted to men in order to release men for more active duties.In certain directions, for example in Record and Pay Offices, the military organisation is now very largely dependent on the employment of women. the demobilisation of the Forces at large will throw additional burdens on such offices,,and it will undoubtedly be necessary to retain many members of the Women&apos;forces for this work for some considerable time after demobilisation begins.20. We have approached the problem of demobilising the Women&apos;s forces by considering whether the scheme recommended as fair and reasonable for men would be equally so for women, and if so, what modifications, if any, are desirable and practicable. We have reached the conclusion that, subject to the modifications to which we refer in the following paragraphs, the scheme wehave recommended for the demobilisation of men, based on age and service, issuitable for the demobilisation of women, and we recommend accordingly.Subject to some special provision for married personnel (see paragraphs 22 to24) we recommend that the special priorities which would entitle a man to early demobilisation irrespective of or within his age and service group, should operate in a similar manner in the case of members of the Women&apos;s Forces (seeAppendix B). We understand that necessary arrangements are being madeto record the personal information required for this purpose in a central cardindex for each of the Women&apos;s Forces.21. It must be borne in mind that the age composition of the Women&apos;forces is very different from that of the Men&apos;s Forces. A high proportion ofwomen in the Forces are at present not above 21 years of age, and it follows thatin applying a scheme of priorities based on age and length of service thedetermining factor in the majority of cases will be length of service.As in the case of men, the first group for demobilisation should, irrespective of the length of their service, comprise women above an age to be fixed by theGovernment before demobilisation commences. The suggested age limit formen was 50, but the same age limit for members of the Women&apos;s Forces wouldhave negligible results owing to the very small number of older women in theForces, the proportion of whom is decreasing continuously owing &quot;to the com-pulsory enrolment of young women. We suggest, therefore, that personnelaged 35 and over, irrespective of their length of service, would be appropriate for the first demobilisation group of the Women&apos;s Forces.22. We agree on the principle that a married woman should be given special priority of demobilisation to enable her to rejoin her husband or[24572] d
children. We are, however, unable to reach agreement on whether it is necessarythat such preference should extend to every married woman irrespective of herdomestic circumstances.23. The opinion of the majority of the Committee is that special priority should be limited to the married woman who declares her intention of setting uphome and whose husband or children are, in fact, in a position to live with her.The early demobilisation of married women irrespective of their domesticreponsibilities would be unfair to those unmarried women who, by reason ofage or service, have stronger claims to priority. It must be realised in this connexion that the great majority of women in the Women&apos;s Forces to-day areunmarried and that although in general no married woman can at present becalled up for the Women&apos;s Forces, marriage during service constitutes no ground for the release of a woman during the War. Further, the married woman whodesires to set up home for relatives or dependents, other than her husband orher children, will be able to apply for early release on compassionate groundsin common with the unmarried woman with similar responsibilities.No difficulty in administering these arrangements is anticipated inasmuch asthe Officers of the Women&apos;s Forces are generally familiar with the domesticcircumstances of women in their charge.24. The Admiralty representatives take the view that, subject to theproduction of acceptable evidence of marriage, all married women should beincluded in a special priority class. This view is based on the following con-siderations : (a) An absolute priority is clear-cut and easy to work.   A refinement uponthe definition would involve enquiries, consuming time and labour at a moment of extreme pressure.(b) These enquiries may be of an ruiusually embarrassing nature, likely to cause resentment and in respect of many details may not admit ofproof.(c) - The condition of &quot; intention to set up a home with husband or children &quot;is uncertain and speculative. The conditions of the time transport,political disturbance, &amp;c. may throw out any forecast of a husband&apos; return from the Forces or from munition work : he may turn upunexpectedly or be delayed for months.(d) The condition is inappropriate to the wives of long service naval personnel and its application would complicate their demobilisation.(e) The premature release of a large number of married women with no real priority claim will cause less social and political trouble thanthe unjustified retention of one woman whose husband or family isawaiting her return in vain.25. We think it desirable to add that we do not recommend the earlydemobilisation of women on expressing an intention of marriage. Women whointend marriage will be able to qualify for leave for the purpose without regardto their possible claims to early demobilisation on other grounds. Subsequently,they will receive such preferential treatment as the Government decides shouldbe given to married women.Persons vitally needed for National Resettlement or Reconstruction.26. After the last War, special steps were taken to arrange for theimmediate demobilisation of individuals whose return to civil life wouldrapidly create employment for others or who were urgently required for thereconstruction of some important business. Such persons, who were described as &quot;pivotal men,&quot; were identified before demobilisation commenced and weregiven priority of demobilisation over all others. We have considered whether any arrangement of this nature should form part of the plans for demobilisationon this occasion.27. The withdrawal of men from civil life for His Majesty&apos;s Forces duringthe present War has been very carefully regulated. A Schedule of reserved occupations was brought into operation on the outbreak of war, the effect ofwhich has been that a very large number of men in important occupations havenot been called up for service. The Schedule was not applied to men called up under the Military Training Act, nor to Territorials and Reservists mobilisedon the outbreak of war, but large numbers of these men who would otherwise have
been &apos;; reserved &quot; in the most important of the occupations have been released for civil employment.Apart from the operation of the Schedule of Reserved Occupations, it hasbeen possible, on application by employers, and latterly on application by employees themselves, for the calling up of a person to be deferred so long as theimportance of his civil occupation showed that this course was in the national-interest. Further, Joint Recruiting Boards have been able to recommend whetherit would be in the national interest for a university student, or one of equivalentstanding, to continue his studies, and in regard to qualified technical and scientific students, whether they should be allocated to the Forces or retained incivil life according to their qualifications.28. In addition to the control exercised over the withdrawal of men from,civil life, the Service Departments are able to release officers and men from theForces when the military situation permits, and it is clearly in the national interest that they should take up the civil employment in question. In such casesthe period of release may be limited, but several thousands of officers and men have been released for an indefinite period and will probably not be required toreturn to their units.We feel therefore that the individuals required for positions of the first importance in connection with national resettlement and reconstruction will to alarge extent be already available from civil resources. The Government Depart-ments most likely to be concerned with the transition from war to peace conditions have given considerable support to this view.29. The immediate demobilisation of special Industrial and OccupationalGroups vital for national reconstruction has already been provided for(Appendix B, item 2 (b)), but exceptional individual cases not covered by such arrangements are bound to arise. In view of the close attention which will bepaid, both by the Forces and the general public, to cases in which individuals are granted immediate demobilisation, it is important that the privilege should belimited to those of unquestionable merit. We recommend therefore that such applications should be dealt with under a procedure based on that for the release from the Forces of men required for civil employment during the War.&apos;Under this procedure employers are required to make their representations to the Government Department which is most closely concerned with the work forwhich the member of the Forces is required. Where the Government Departmentdesires to recommend the case, it completes an application form on which thegrounds for release are fully stated. The form is then sent to the appropriateService Department, which has the advice of the Ministry of Labour and NationalService in co-ordinating the competing demands of other Departments and therequirements of the Services.30. During the last War arrangements were made for the identification inadvance of individuals who were to be demobilised immediately on the cessation of hostilities, but such arrangements caused a great deal of fruitless work in keeping lists of names up to date. Provided a scheme is ready for introductionat short notice, we do not think that any identification in advance is necessary.Moreover, any early announcement of the arrangements contemplated would leadto a flood of enquiries and applications which would engage the attention of staffwhose energies are being better used in the war effort.Other Persons for whom Employment is Waiting.31. In our Interim Report we dealt briefly with the claims to earlydemobilisation of men for whom employment is waiting. Such claims are entirelyopposed to those of men who desire early demobilisation to find employment,fearing that this may become more difficult later on. We do not know to what extent the provisions of Section 14 of the National Service (Armed Forces) Act,1939, for the reinstatement after the War of certain members of His Majesty&apos;forces in their previous civil employment, will be effective. This Section doesnot apply to time-expired regulars or to men who have enlisted voluntarily duringthe War, and claims to early demobilisation by such men on the grounds that,their employment is not protected by these provisions cannot be ignored. On theother hand, it will be argued that it is in&apos; the national interest, and in theinterests of the men concerned, that they should not be demobilised only to remainunemployed for long periods while others who could be employed are retained in[24572] d 2
the Forces. It is also probable that pressure for the early release of formeremployees will be brought to bear by employers who have been supplementing their employees&apos; service pay.32. We have given clue weight to these considerations, and, bearing in mind the general objections to increasing the number of special priority classes, we nowconfirm our provisional recommendation that the priority to be granted to suchcases should be limited to the demobilisation group. The value of such prioritywill obviously depend on the size of the groups and the rate at whichdemobilisation proceeds.33. Even with this limited priority it is a matter of importance that onlyunquestionable claims should be admitted. An analogous scheme which was inoperation after the last War was considerably abused, and this no doubtcontributed in no small measure to the discontent and unrest prevalent at onetime among those men who were retained in the Forces. It is inevitable thatthere will be many applications, and the arrangements for dealing with themmust be decentralised as far as possible. We are therefore of the opinion thatany practicable course which will give the desired results must involve the use ofthe Employment Exchange Service of the Ministry of Labour and NationalService.34.   We recommend that the following procedure should be adopted :  (a) Applications should be accepted only if made by a man&apos;s employer foran employee, or, in the case of a person working on his own account,by a partner, a relative carrying on the business of a member of theForces in his absence, or a business associate. Applications shouldnot be accepted from members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces in respect oftheir own demobilisation.(b) Applications should be made in the form set out in Appendix A to thisReport, which provides for an undertaking by the proposed employer to employ the person concerned on the recognised terms andconditions for at least six months in a specified occupation and at a specified place, subject to his being demobilised within six months ofthe date of the application. In the case of members of HisMajesty&apos;s Forces who are not employees, the applicant must declareof his own knowledge that the services of the persons conceimed arerequired in the business in which he was engaged before he joined the Forces.(c) Application forms should be available at the local offices of the Ministryof Labour and National Service, to which they should be returnedwhen completed. Officials of this Department, from informationalready in their possession, or which can be easily obtained, shouldgenerally be able to determine at once whether the application ismade in good faith and should be accepted, though exceptionally,enquiries or investigation will be necessary before a decision can bereached. Officials should not hesitate to give an adverse decision ifthey are not satisfied that the application is genuine. The applicantshould be notified of the decision reached on his application.id) In order that in all cases the member of the Forces concerned can beinformed of the result of the application made on his behalf, allapplications should then be passed to the Service authorities and clearinstructions will have to be provided by Service Departments as to where application forms should be sent. If, when an application hasbeen accepted, the individual concerned does not desire to be demobilised, this fact should be recorded by the Commanding officer on the application form. In other cases, the man&apos;s name should belisted for demobilisation in due course in accordance with the prioritygranted.Persons Proceeding to Educational or Training Courses.35. Among the categories for which it may be suggested that special priority of demobilisation should be granted is that of persons proceeding tocomplete their educational training, especially those accepted for State assistance under the Government scheme which is now being drawn up by an Inter-Departmental Committee.  We understand that that Committee has recently been
, instructed to revise its scheme on the basis that State assistance should be availablenot only to members of the Forces and of the Civil Defence Services, but to othercivilian workers, and in consequence the field of selection will be very wide.If training facilities are likely to be available on demobilisation for allService applicants who qualify under the Government Scheme, there is no sufficient reason for granting them special priority of release. As, however, thisis by no means certain, we have some anxiety lest members of the Forces who donot otherwise qualify for early demobilisation may be placed at a disadvantage in comparison with civilian workers. Even if a suitable proportion of vacancieswere set aside for the Forces it might still be necessary to make special arrange-ments for the release of accepted applicants in order to ensure that full use couldbe made by the Forces of their quota. This would be a comparatively simplematter for those serving at home, but there will be practical difficulties in selectingapplicants who are serving abroad. No doubt the Inter-Departmental Committeewill give special consideration to this matter.Priority on Grounds of Hardship.36. We stated in our Interim Report (paragraph 15 (6)) that any schemefor demobilisation must contain ample provision inter alia for early release oncompassionate grounds. In Appendix C to that Report we recorded our view thatin extreme compassionate cases demobilisation of the person concerned should beeffected at an early date, irrespective of his age and length of service, but that,if a strong case of personal hardship arising out of a person&apos;s occupation or business were established, any preferential treatment should be limited to priority of demobilisation within that person&apos;s age and service group. We have come tothe conclusion that this distinction between the two classes, according to the causeof hardship to the individual, cannot be sustained, and that in both classespriority of demobilisation should be irrespective of age and service.37. After the last War provision was made in regulations as to the precisecircumstances which were to be accepted as constituting domestic or businesshardship for this purpose. In general, domestic hardship had to involvenecessitous circumstances of dependent relatives of prescribed degrees of rela-tionship, coupled with illness or infirmity. Business hardship was confined toproprietors of one-man businesses, and was restricted by conditions, such as age. and length of service overseas. These regulations were intended to applyrigidly : if they did not cover a particular case, the soldier concerned could not qualify for early release, however pitiful the circumstances might be.The regulations relating to the release of officers did not provide for any similar restrictive definitions of circumstances, nor set up any special machineryfor considering such cases.38. We understand that the restrictive procedure outlined above was foundto be extremely difficult to work, and to a large extent it became ineffective asdemobilisation proceeded. Rank attained in the Service has little relation to aperson&apos;s position in civil life, and we have not found any reason which wouldwarrant discrimination between the treatment of officers and men in this respect.Since the last War considerable improvement has been made in financial assistance by the State in cases of need, and we think that necessitous circumstances need no&apos; longer be regarded as essential part of the grounds on which compassionate releasecan be sought. We feel generally that no hard and fast definition of whatconstitutes hardship or adequate grounds for compassion is practicable or desirable. Any case in which the circumstances connected with a man&apos;s domesticor business affairs cause real distress demands sympathetic consideration, and if,without detriment to the national interest, the distress can be alleviated by early release of the man, this should be allowed.39. The successful administration of such a scheme will depend largely onthe sound judgment of Commanding Officers and their superiors, to whom a wide measure of discretion will have to be given. The competent authority will belaid down by each Service Department. In order to secure a reasonable degreeof uniformity of treatment of cases those responsible for decisions will need an authoritative indication of the standards to be set. We therefore indicate belowthe degree of hardship which would justify early demobilisation on compassionate grounds.   Items (a) to (e), inclusive, and item (A) would be appropriate to both
male and female personnel, items (/) and (g) to members of the Women&apos;s Forcesonly :-(a) Where there is grave illness of a near relative, such as husband, wifeor child, likely to terminate fatally at an early but unascertainabledate, so that leave would not meet the difficulty.(b) Where there is grave illness of a near relative and the presence of theman would make a substantial contribution to the patients chanceof recovery.(c) Where the individual responsible for the man&apos;s home dies or falls ill,and there is no one to take charge of the home, and the case cannot bedealt with by a reasonable amount of leave.(d) Where the man&apos;s home has been broken up as a result of the death of his wife, and the children are with various relatives or in Homes,and he wishes to be demobilised for the purpose of re-establishing thehome.(e) Where an existing business is likely to be lost by a man&apos;s further absenceas, for example, where a sole surviving partner dies or falls ill and.cannot attend to it. (The term &quot;a man&apos;s business&quot; is intended torefer to any business in which he has a substantial interest other thanmerely as an employee, i:e., as a partner or director, or to a business in which he has a reasonable expectation of future benefit, e.g., wherea man is the paid manager of his wife&apos;s father&apos;s business. the term &apos;&apos; business&quot; is to be interpreted widely and includes an agricultural holding and the like.)(/) Where a relative for whom a member of the Women&apos;s Forces normally. keeps house is demobilised from His Majesty&apos;s Forces or ceases tobe employed on full time war work, and her presence is desirable inorder that the house may be re-established.(g) Where a member of the Women&apos;s Forces desires to re-establish a home in order that her own dependants may be properly cared for.(h) Exceptional circumstances constituting a similar degree of hardship tothose indicated in (d)-(g) above.40. While it is a necessary condition of any scheme for dealing with applications for release on compassionate grounds that a decision should bereached quickly, it is of course essential that the scheme should not be abused.Proper verification must be made of facts on which an application is based, but such verification should not be so exacting as to cause undue delay. It will therefore be necessary for all personnel to be informed that applications for earlydemobilisation on compassionate grounds should be submitted to commanding officers supported by corroborative evidence which should be in one of thefollowing forms : (a) A report by an officer of the Assistance Board.(b) A police report.(c) A report by the Command Welfare Officer, the Soldiers&apos;, Sailors&apos; and airmen&apos;s Families Association or other institution having the requisite machinery for making enquiries.(d) A medical report when the question of illness arises.(e) In cases of business hardship a report by a firm of accountants, solicitorsor a bank or. where the business is small, by the Assistance Board.It should be the duty of the Commanding Officer to obtain furtherindependent verification of the facts whenever he thinks such a course is necessary.41. There will be cases in which, if the alleged, circumstances are true, therelease of a man will be a matter of great urgency. In such cases the position canbe met by granting an immediate period of leave pending verification of the facts in the manner recommended above.Summary of Demobilisation Priorities.42. In Appendix C to our Interim Report we set out tentatively the considerations that might be put forward as affecting priority of release of;individuals or groups of individuals. It will be seen from the recommendations which we have made above that on further consideration we have modified ouropinion in certain respects. Our later recommendations have been embodied ina revised Appendix which is attached as Appendix B to this Report.
Meaning of the Expression &quot; Service in the Present War.&quot;43. We have recommended that the basic scheme for demobilisation should depend on age and length of service in the present War. In calculating the ages of members of all Forces, Service Departments will no doubt find it expedient toadopt the simple rule that a man&apos;s age for this purpose should be his age on thepreceding 31st December. It is also necessary to define clearly what is meant by&quot; service in the present War.&quot; As far as is reasonably practicable the definitionshould be the same for each Service, both for officers and other ranks and both forthe Men&apos;s and Women&apos;s Forces. It must be borne in mind that assessment ofservice for this purpose will normally have to be made by the Commanding Officerwith reference only to documents available in the unit: meticulous accuracy onminor issues is neither possible nor necessary.44. We recommend that, subject to the exclusion of the periods referredto in paragraph 45 below, the period of &quot; service in the present War &quot; should in each case date from whichever of the following dates is the later : (a) 3rd September, 1939, or x(b) The date of entering the Service or of reporting on being mobilised.To simplify calculations and statistics, the period should terminate on a fixed date to be laid down for all personnel.Many classes at the time of demobilisation will have had continuous servicesince before the outbreak of war on permanent engagements, such as reservistsrecalled, for duty or Militia men under the Military Training Act. Such men will be able to count the maximum service possible under this scheme and, although there may be some pressure to allow service prior to the 3rd September, 1939,to count, these classes will have little, if anything, to gain by a concession whichwould complicate the calculations involved. Further, we are of the opinion thatthere is a real difference between service in peace-time and service during the War,and that on grounds of equity these classes should not be placed in a better position than their colleagues who were serving in the Territorials or the reserves and who reported for duty on general mobilisation.45. We are of the opinion that the following periods should not counttowards &quot; service in the present War,&quot; but that for reasons of administrative convenience any such periods of 28 days&apos; duration or less should be ignored, evenif they occur on more than one occasion in respect of the same individual:  (a) Leave without pay.(b) Temporary release from the Service for any reason.In general, periods referred to at (a) and (b) above are spent incivil life on civil activities either at the request of the individualconcerned or with his consent.(c) Absence without leave.(d) Time spent in desertion.A conviction for desertion entails forfeiture of the whole of theservice rendered prior to the date of conviction, although for Terri-torials only the time spent in desertion is forfeited. The normal ruleseems unnecessarily severe for this purpose, and it is proposed todisallow only the actual time spent in desertion.(e) Detention.(/) Imprisonment.46. We have also considered how time spent as shown below should be takeninto account, and we recommend that such periods should be reckoned as&quot; service in the present War.&quot;(a) Leave with pay.(b) Time spent in hospital.We have considered whether time spent in hospital for causeswithin a man&apos;s own control should be excluded. Although we shouldbe disposed to recommend that such time should not be treated as&quot; service in the present War,&quot; it seems unlikely that such periods couldbe identified readily at the time of demobilisation.(c) Time spent as a prisoner of war or in internment in a neutral country.47. Persons who have served both as officers and in the ranks, whethercontinuously or after discharge or termination of commission or warrant, shouldbe credited with all periods of service which would otherwise have been treated
as &quot; service in the present War.&quot; Persons who rejoin a Service after dischargeor who, on transfer or after discharge from one Service, join another service should be treated similarly, provided that in all cases the earlier Service wasacknowledged when entering into the last engagement.48. These rules could, at the moment, by applied by Commanding Officers toall cases with the following two exceptions : (a) Naval Officers whose full service will not be recorded on documents in the possession of the Commanding Officer. Generally, their own state-ments of service will have to be accepted unless they appear to be soimprobable that verification seems necessary, in which case it will be.possible to obtain such verification from Headquarters quickly.(b) Soldiers (Army other ranks) for whose service Commanding Officers must depend on Army Form B. 103, which may at present be incompletewith regard to service prior to the middle of 1940. The War office are, however, contemplating measures to remedy this deficiency.49. In describing the periods of service to which we have referred above,each Service uses different technical terms. There should, however, be nodifficulty, when regulations are framed, in adopting the appropriate phraseologypeculiar to the Service concerned.Transfer of Young&quot; Men from one Service to another.50. On the conclusion of hostilities there will be under training in the RoyalAir Force, and to a less extent in the Royal Navy, a very large number of youngmen with short service, whose training it will not be profitable to complete andwhom the Services concerned will wish to release as early as possible, a course which would be contrary to the general scheme of demobilisation we have recom-mended and might give rise to discontent among other men in all Services.Moreover. - it is envisaged that the National Service Acts or some similarlegislation will continue until the end of the emergency and that further classeswill be called up for the Army. We feel that the demobilisation of men from theRoyal Navy and Royal Air Force who are in the same age classes as men still being called up for the Army could not easily be defended. The transference of theseyoung men to the Army would permit the demobilisation of older men. who would otherwise have to be retained.51. In our Interim Report we pointed out that further legislation would benecessary before men could be transferred compulsorily from the Royal Navy andthe Royal Air Force to the Army. This difficulty has now been overcome by theNational Service (No. 2) Act, 1941, Section 4 of which provides, inter alia, for theservice of an enlistment notice on any member of the Armed Forces subject to theNational Service Acts, notwithstanding that there is no proclamation underSection 1 of the principal Act applicable to him. The way is now clear, therefore,for the compulsory removal of a man from one Service to another when it is decided this action should be taken.52. We do not consider it necessary or desirable that similar steps shouldbe taken in regard to officers, nor in regard to members of the Women&apos;s Forces,whether officers or other ranks.Repatriation of Persons Normally Resident Abroad and of their Dependants.53. In the paragraphs which follow we have used the term &quot; repatriation &quot;to refer to the return of persons to countries other than the United Kingdom, butnot necessarily to the countries of which they are nationals or citizens.54. Members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces whose normal places of residence are outside the United Kingdom may be divided into the following classes : -(a) Persons who enlisted abroad otherwise than under approved schemes,including reservists recalled to duty from abroad.(b) Persons who, under approved schemes, left their places of residenceabroad for enlistment in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.(c) Persons who made their own way to the United Kingdom for the purposeof enlisting in His Majesty&apos;s Forces.(d) Persons who joined His Majesty&apos;s Forces while temporarily resident inthe United Kingdom.
Repatriation at public expense is at present assured to persons in class (a)under Service regulations and to persons in class (&amp;) under the terms of theiragreements. Persons in classes (c) and (d) have no title to free repatriation, butwe feel that they are morally entitled to be treated, as after the last War, notless favourably than classes (a) and (&amp;).We recommend, therefore, that in addition to the right of members ofHis Majesty&apos;s Forces to repatriation under existing regulations or under theconditions of approved schemes, repatriation at public expense should be madeavailable to all members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces who, on demobilisation, wish toreturn to the countries in which they normally resided prior to enlistment. Suchrepatriation at public expense should include the cost of any onward journeyfrom the port of disembarkation to the normal place of residence.55. We think that, as a general rule, a person should be regarded as&quot;temporarily resident&quot; (paragraph 54 (d) above) in the United Kingdom, if hearrived here after a date to be specified, which we suggest should be the1st September, 1938. The adoption of such a rule would reduce cases of hardship to a minimum by giving a title to free repatriation to those persons serving inHis Majesty&apos;s Forces who came to this country at any time after the Munichcrisis. Any such rule should not, however, operate to exclude any person whowas temporarily resident in the United Kingdom for the purpose of attending are recognised educational or training course (including an apprenticeship), theperiod of which did not exceed four years. This class was given similar treatmentafter the last War.56. Many members of the Forces normally resident abroad have been joined by their wives and families; others have married while serving in the Forcesoutside their own countries. Exceptionally, men normally resident in this country have married women who were normally resident abroad. We have consideredwhat title to repatriation should be given to the dependants of members ofHis Majesty&apos;s Forces in these circumstances, and we recommend that the titles ofmembers of His Majesty&apos;s Forces to repatriation at public expense should extend to their dependants as defined in special regulations to be laid down for thepurposes of repatriation.Although not strictly within our terms of reference, we have given incidentalconsideration to the claims of dependants of personnel who have been killed or have died while serving in His Majesty&apos;s Forces. We think it may be helpful to place on record our opinion that such dependants, as defined in the specialregulations referred to in the first part of this paragraph, should (i) have the same title to repatriation at public expense as they would havehad if the member of the Forces concerned were still alive, or(ii) be entitled, if appropriate, to repatriation at public expense to their ownnormal places of residence abroad, even though the deceased memberof the Forces concerned, having been normally resident in this country,would have had no title to repatriation.In the case of dependants who come from abroad, we think that it will benecessary to lay down a condition that they shall have embarked for this country,or made all arrangements&apos; to do so, before the cessation of hostilities.57. We are unable to reach agreement on the classes of dependants to be covered by definitions in special regulations referred to above.The general view of your Committee, the War Office representativesdissenting, is that definitions should be drawn widely and embrace those classesset out in Appendix C, Part I. This view is primarily based on the desirabilityof repatriating, if at all possible, those classes of dependants who, if they remainin this country, may have to be supported out of public funds for long periodsat a cost far in excess of the cost of their repatriation. In particular, the opinion is held that the free repatriation of &apos;&apos; unmarried wives &quot; and their children followslogically from the recognition of their dependence by the payment during the war of Special Dependants Allowances and their right to pensions, &amp;c, and.that publioopinion will demand the inclusion of such dependants in the scheme. their inclusion in the scheme under the special circumstances of demobilisation shouldnot prejudice the maintenance of the existing rules as to the free passage todependants of service personnel proceeding overseas in peace time.58.   The considered opinion of the War Office is that from a Service pointof view a case has not been made out for a scheme on broad lines for free passagesat the expense of Service funds which would throw an additional burden on[24572] , e
Service machinery in sifting claims and arranging transport at a time whenmachinery is strained to the utmost. As the result of their experiences after thelast War, they are of the opinion that a repatriation scheme which covers the limited classes of dependants defined in Appendix C, Part II, will need all theattention and energy which the army staffs can give it. The definition proposedin Appendix C, Part I, especially paragraph 4, would entail exhaustiveinvestigation into the circumstances &quot;of each individual case and adjudicationthereon, whereas the definition proposed in Appendix C, Part II, would entailonly the verification of essential facts which would be recorded on the applicantsdocuments. On the particular point of granting free repatriation to unmarrieddependants living as wives and their children, the War Office feel that as suchdependants do not obtain free passages in peace time when a soldier is sent overseas, this concession might create a dangerous precedent.59. The admission by a Service Department of applications for repatriationwhether of members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces or of their dependants will not givethe persons concerned any right to enter the countries to which repatriation is desired. Permission to enter such countries, even if within the British Empire,is subject to approval by the Governments concerned. It will be essential for the member of His Majesty&apos;s Forces to apply for free repatriation for his dependantsat the same time as he applies for his own repatriation and for permits of entry to the country of intended residence to be obtained for the man and his dependantsbefore passages can be allotted. We assume that normally there will be no obstacle in the way of the return of members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces and their wives and children to the various parts of the Empire which they left in orderto fight for the Empire, though there might be some difficulty on a wider inter-pretation of dependency, and no doubt it will be possible to negotiate a simplifiedprocedure dealing with claims for admission to the countries concerned of those persons to whom repatriation at public expense is available. On the other hand,the return of persons to foreign countries, whether nationals, other aliens or british citizens, will undoubtedly present many difficult problems. We hope thatthe earliest possible steps will be taken to secure the agreement of Allied andother foreign Governments to the adoption of as simple a procedure as possiblefor granting to members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces permission to return with their dependants.60. We understand that there may be cases in which it would be in thepublic interest to repatriate those members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces whose applica-tions for repatriation at public expense would not be granted by service departments under our recommendations. In order that this possibility may beconsidered, Service Departments should notify details of all cases in whichrepatriation has been refused to the Dominions Office, the Colonial Office, the india Office, the Burma Office, or the Foreign Office, as may be appropriate.61. Aliens who fail to apply for repatriation or whose applications are notgranted will be demobilised in the United Kingdom in due course. To assist theHome Office in resuming control of these aliens it is essential that Service Depart-ments should notify the Home Office of all such cases that can be identified,irrespective of whether or not the person concerned was resident in this country before joining His Majesty&apos;s Forces.62. In respect of the conditions to be attached to free repatriation, usefulguidance is afforded by the experience gained after the last War. Men who wishedto take advantage of the arrangements for free repatriation were then given the option of remaining in the Forces until passages could be provided for them orof being demobilised in this country and taking passages later after dates whichthey nominated. This procedure, however, led to considerable difficulties inregard to men who, having exercised the option of being repatriated afterdemobilisation in this country, exhausted their financial resources before theywere repatriated. It was also found that, if persons were repatriated while serving in the Forces and still subject to Service discipline, it was a comparativelysimple matter to arrange their passages as shipping became available. Further,when passages were provided before the accommodation of ships had been con-verted to meet normal commercial requirements, a considerable saving in the costof repatriation was effected. In view of this experience, we think that personswho wish to be repatriated at public expense must remain in the Forces until theycan be repatriated or until it becomes clear that they cannot obtain permission toenter the countries to which they wish to return. It would follow that any person who applies to be demobilised in this country, or in appropriate cases fails to
apply for repatriation before being so demobilised see paragraph 64 below would thereby forfeit any title to free repatriation which he might otherwise havehad : it is particularly important that this should be made clear to servingpersonnel before they are demobilised in this country.63. We realise that among those awaiting demobilisation in this countrythere will be many persons normally resident abroad to whom a visit to this country will be a unique experience. Many of them will prefer to be demobilised in thiscountry, and be repatriated at a later date, so as to have an opportunity forvisiting places of historic or personal interest, for spending some time withrelatives and friends, or for exploring the country-side. There is, moreover, little doubt that, for some time after the War, the demands for passages will exceed the shipping accommodation available, and we feel that it will be possible for theServices to meet all reasonable requests for opportunities to travel in this country by granting leave, in so far as the shipping position permits.64. It has been represented to us that members of His Majesty&apos;s forces who were normally resident abroad should not be demobilised in this countryexcept for good cause. Apart from the administrative difficulties in deter-mining what circumstances would constitute good cause for demobilisation in thiscountry, such a course appears to us to be impracticable. Many persons normallyresident abroad cannot be identified as such, and unless they apply and qualify for free repatriation under arrangements to be made by the Service Departmentsthey will be demobilised in this country as a matter of course. We feel, therefore,that it would be difficult to resist the claims of others who, although they could be identified as normally resident abroad, wished to be demobilised in this country,and particularly so in the case of British subjects whose admission to this countryin ordinary circumstances could not be refused.65. We are, however, alive to the serious social consequences which might arise from the demobilisation in this country of any appreciable numbers ofcertain classes of coloured men who are serving in His Majesty&apos;s Forces. our attention has been drawn to the difficult problems which were presented in theareas of certain ports as the result of an influx of coloured men after the last War,and we are of the opinion that all possible steps must be taken to prevent anyaggravation or recurrence of these difficulties. Although it could not be argued that men of colour could not be identified, most of the men in the classes con-cerned are British subjects and. as stated above, they could not be refused admission to this country, nor could they be deported if they proved to be undesirable citizens. Moreover, any apparent discrimination in the nature of a&quot; colour bar &quot; could not be accepted as a solution of the problem. If we haveappreciated the situation correctly, the only course open to us is to recommendvery strongly that Service Departments should do all they possibly can by adminis-trative action to reduce to a minimum the opportunities these men might have ofbeing demobilised in this country. The concentration of these men in separateunits, the restriction of their service to theatres of war overseas, and the repatria-tion of men in complete units would do much to prevent a serious social problemarising.66. We think it desirable to draw special attention to the fact that a largeproportion of aliens, especially Germans and Austrians, in the Forces are refugees who, when they enlisted, were either resident in this country or on their way to america. There are also in our Forces some hundreds of Czechs who refused tocontinue serving in their national army, and the legislation for conscripting allied nationals in this country will add some further hundreds of dissident Alliedcitizens. These persons, in the eyes of the Allied Governments, have committed a grave offence in refusing to serve in their national Forces, and it will thus bedifficult to send them back to their own countries. Many persons in the abovecategories would not be entitled to repatriation under the arrangements recom-mended above, or, if so entitled, might not wish to take advantage of them toreturn to their own countries, and questions will arise after the War whether theyshould be assisted to leave this country and, if so, for what destinations. Theresponsibility for dealing with these questions will, however, not be &quot;appropriate to the Service Departments; they will involve discussions with foreign Govern-ments and will have the attention of the Home Office and the Foreign Office. Werecommend, in the meantime, that the Treasury should consider whether it wouldnot be in the public interest to provide free passages for any Service aliens who desired to return to countries of which they are nationals or citizens or to proceedto other countries which they had obtained permission to enter, but who were not.[24572] . e 2
entitled under the above recommendations to receive free passages to suchdestinations.67. Our recommendations on the repatriation of members of His Majesty&apos;forces should in general apply to members of the Womens Forces in the same way as to men. It follows that some members of the Women&apos;s Forces may beentitled to repatriation both as members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces and asdependants of men who are serving or have served in the Forces. If a womanserved as an officer and her husband in the ranks, or vice versa, she could obtaincertain advantages according to whether she claimed repatriation in her own rightor as a dependant. The position of her children or other dependants may varysimilarly according to the manner in which a claim on their behalf is put forward.In order to remove any doubt which may exist in these circumstances we makethe following recommendations : -(a) The title of a member of the Women&apos;s Forces to repatriation should bedetermined in accordance with the rules laid down for repatriation of members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces generally.(b) For the purposes of repatriation the dependants of a member of theWomen&apos;s Forces should be as defined in special regulations to be laiddown (see paragraphs 57 and 58 above), and their title to repatriationshould be determined in accordance with the rules laid down for there patriation of dependants of members of His Majesty&apos;s Forcesgenerally.(c) If members of the Women&apos;s Forces or their dependants have a dual title to repatriation, they should, if they wish, be allowed to claimrepatriation in the manner which is more beneficial to them.68. . We have recommended (paragraph 54 above) that repatriation at public expense should be extended on demobilisation to classes which include personsnormally resident overseas, but who have only a moral claim to free repatriation.Such persons will have no title to repatriation except under regulations made forthe demobilisation of the Forces. We think it desirable, therefore, to draw attention&quot; to those members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces who, though normally residentoverseas and morally entitled to repatriation at public expense, are dischargedduring the War under existing regulations and have no opportunity for sub-mitting a claim for repatriation. Consideration of the steps to be taken to dealwith such cases is not within our terms of reference, but we have no doubt that theauthorities concerned would wish to treat such men not less favourably than their colleagues who remain in the Forces until they are demobilised after the War.Demobilisation Abroad of Personnel Serving Overseas.69. Our attention has been drawn to the opportunities there may be afterthe War for members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces to take up civil employment in thecountries in which they are serving, and the consequential need for arrangementsfor the demobilisation on the spot of men who secure such employment.70. The consideration of any scheme for the resettlement of servingpersonnel in this way is outside the scope of our terms of reference, but we are assured that there will be no difficulty in arranging the demobilisation in thecountries in which they are serving, of those men who are otherwise available for demobilisation and are acceptable to the Governments of the countries in whichthey wish to remain.71. The question has been raised whether those demobilised in this wayshould be given, for ia reasonable period, a deferred right to free repatriation tothe United Kingdom as a safeguard against failure to settle down. In the specialcircumstances of the war period such a right is now being given to men dischargedin South Africa for a period of two years or to the end of the War, whichever is earlier, and it is thought that some Dominions, which normally require animmigrant to be possessed of substantial capital, may ask for a similar deferredright for those demobilised in their countries after the War who are unable to fulfil this condition. We feel, however, that it is difficult to deal with thisquestion apart from the general problem of migration within the Empire afterthe War, and we therefore go no further than to point out that the grant of adeferred right of repatriation to the United Kingdom of those demobilised abroadwould make it difficult to refuse, as recommended in paragraph 62 above, the grantof a similar deferred right of free return home, to personnel from other partsof the Empire demobilised in the United Kingdom.
Transport Arrangements.72. The factors to be taken into account in considering the arrangements to be made for the transport of men about to be demobilised cannot yet be foreseen,and we can therefore make no recommendation on this subject.The Administration of the Scheme.73. In paragraph 15 of our Interim Report we laid stress on the desirabilityof the demobilisation scheme being as simple as possible, and we have kept this objective constantly in mind. We recognise, however, that in the endeavour alsoto meet, to a reasonable degree, the wide variety of circumstances calling forspecial treatment, we have been forced to introduce many detailed provisions. Ifthe scheme is to operate smoothly when the time comes it is essential that thosewho will have charge of its administration, whether in the Services or in theDepartments concerned, should make themselves thoroughly familiar in advancewith all its details and should have already issued or have available the necessary instructions, explanatory leaflets, forms, &amp;c. These should be in the clearest andsimplest terms. It would also seem to be very desirable to place upon some body..such as the Chiefs of Staffs&apos; Committee, the duty of suggesting to the War cabinet at the appropriate moment the issue of a preliminary warning to all departments to complete their preparations for demobilisation.74. It will be readily appreciated that the return of a member of HisMajesty&apos;s Forces to civil life involves the completion of a number of documentsfor various civil and military purposes. Hitherto such documents have not beenstandardised and have been completed separately, which has led to duplication insome directions and has been expensive in the use of staff and stationery. TheWar Office have been in consultation with the Civil Departments concerned, andhave planned a &quot; Demobilisation Booklet&quot; which will contain all the formsrequired for demobilisation purposes. The forms have been simplified as far aspossible and their number reduced to the absolute minimum necessary for efficient administration. They will be completed and detached as the man passes throughthe various stages of demobilisation, and this will ensure that all the returnswhich should be rendered are, in fact, rendered promptly to the correct destina-tions. The &quot; Demobilisation Booklet,&quot; which is at present only in provisionalform, is under examination by the other Service Departments who have agreed in principle to a similar course.Re-establishment in Civil Life.75. In the course of our consideration of arrangements for the release ofmen and women from the Forces we have had brought to our notice the need forsome further machinery to give to those seeking to establish themselves in civil life guidance, and possibly in.some cases financial assistance also, of a kind ratheroutside both the present scope of the Appointments Department of the Ministryof Labour and National Service and the plans now being formulated for thefurther education and training of demobilised personnel and others. Thoseplaced in employment and those sent for further education to the universities or similar institutions as well as those placed with professional firms for training will mostly find in their new associations the guidance that they need in their further careers. But not so in all cases or in the case of some of those setting upon their own account. It was one of the tragedies of the last War that so manyyoung men who had served their country with distinction in the field and withoutany experience or knowledge of business conditions should have embarked theirall in ventures that had little, if any, prospects of success. In this War largenumbers of youths have joined the Forces, especially the Royal Air Force, on leaving school, have received their commissions at an early age and may on demobilisation receive substantial gratuities.The matter is clearly outside the machinery of demobilisation. We do not feel that we should say more than that an organisation which could give expert advice both to officers and men as to the prospects and conditions of success invarious spheres, and could keep in touch, giving practical help as and when itwas needed, would in our view do much to prevent repetition of the grievouswastage and, disappointment that constituted a reproach to the nation afterthe last War. If anything of the kind is to be done, it is important that plans should be worked out and approved in advance of demobilisation and thenecessary machinery be ready when demobilisation begins.
Conclusion.76. Throughout our enquiry into the machinery of demobilisation we havebeen very conscious how close is the interdependence of machinery and policy.We found it necessary to submit for Ministerial decision the question whether on this occasion, as after the last War. the immediate availability of employmentwas to be a primary consideration in determining priority of release. ministers have accepted our recommendation that, oh the contrary, priority of release after this War should in the main be dependent on a combination of age and lengthof service, availability of employment conferring only a limited degree of priority.77. The scheme which we have devised on this basis will enable the personnel %of the Services to be demobilised in an orderly system of priorities, whetherthe process be fast or slow. The rate at which demobilisation can proceed will depend on a number of factors, the chief of which will be ihe size of the InterimForces which have to be maintained for operational reasons. Whatever thecourse of events, it may be that civil industry will for a time be unable to absorb men and women as rapidly as they can be demobilised.There is little doubt that the vast majority of members of the Forces willbe anxious to return to civil life at the earliest opportunity. Experience after&apos;the last War suggests that, though men may be reconciled to a postponement of release if they are satisfied that their services are needed in the Forces, a slowingup of demobilisation for other reasons would be resented, and the service departments have emphasised the serious effect this would have on Service morale and discipline.78. We respectfully urge that the success of the scheme which we haveevolved for the demobilisation of the Forces will be dependent upon the fulfilment of three conditions : (a) That all possible steps are taken, by training and otherwise, to assistmen  and women  released  from  the Forces  in  finding  suitable.&apos; employment as soon as possible.(b) That the policy of the Government, both internal and external, is directed to the provision of full employment, so that men and womenretained in the Forces under our scheme of priorities will not beplaced at a serious disadvantage in comparison with those releasedearly from the Forces, from Civil Defence and from war industries.(c) That the scheme of demobilisation and the general resettlement policyof the Government are fully explained in good time to the personnel of the Forces and to the general public, every form of publicity andpersuasion being employed to secure general acceptance .79. Finally, we desire to express our high appreciation of the help wehave received throughout our enquiry from our Secretary, Mr. G. W. J. Cole,of the Ministry of Labour and National Service. Amid the pressure of departmental duties he has by his unfailing industry and courtesy greatly easedour task, especially the preparation of our two reports.Signed, on behalf of the Committee,A. W.

THE DEMOBILISATION AND RESETTLEMENT OF LABOUR.Second Interim Eeportof theOfficial Committee on Post-War Internal Economic Problems.I. INTRODUCTION.1. In our Interim Report of the 30th June, 1942, we pointed out that oneof the three major problems of the Post-War Transitional Period was the transferof resources, both human and material, from war to peace-time employment.The transfer of labour resources is obviously dependent on, and must proceedconcurrently with, a similar change-over in the industrial machine which givesthem employment, and it would have been convenient, therefore, to deal at thesame time with the considerations of policy affecting both of them. many difficulties arise, however, on the change-over of industry which have not yet beenfully explored, and on the whole it has seemed better to us to limit this reportto the demobilisation and resettlement of labour; leaving to a subsequent reportthe presentation of the considerations of policy bearing on the demobilisation and resettlement of industry.In the meantime the Board of Trade and Department of Overseas Trade are engaged in discussions with industries on their post-war prospects and problems.The discussions are directed not only to a consideration of markets both homeand export but also to the prospects they afford, of employment and to their probable needs as regards the recovery of specialised workers. Some twenty-fiveindustries have so far been covered; but certain industries important for employ-ment have not been approached : coal-mining, for example, has been left to theMinistry of Fuel, the transport industries to the Ministry of War Transport: themain engineering sections of industry and tbe shipbuilding industry are being dis-cussed separately with the Supply and Defence Departments. Distribution is another important factor in employment the future of which is still too uncertainto allow accurate estimates. The great field of employment in building, including-the repair and reconstruction of war damage, is being reviewed by the Ministryof Works and Planning in consultation with the English and Scottish HousingDepartments. They are framing estimates of labour requirements under thelimits impjosed by scarce materials and are exploring the possibility of trainingnew labour.The Position at the Armistice.2. It is, of course, quite impossible at this stage of the War to give a precisepicture of the man-power situation as it will present itself at the date of theArmistice if indeed we can refer to this as being one point of time. One canonly give figures based on the present distribution of man-power and estimates of probable further changes. The nation is now, however, so highly mobilised forwar that it is unlikely that any error in these estimates will greatly affect the picture as sketched below.3. (a) If we assume a standing Army, Air Force and Navy of one million men after the War, the numbers likely to be released from the Armed Forceswithin the year of the end of hostilities would be about 3,000,000 men and 370,000women.(b) The additional war-time Civil Defence establishments number approxi-mately (July 1942) 235,000 men (including the Police War Reserve) and 78,000&apos;&apos; [24572] f 2
&quot;women most of whom will presumably be demobilised almost immediately afterthe end of the War. The effect on these figures of the recent arrangement to release Civil Defence workers for munition production, &amp;c, is referred to inparagraph 13. In so far as those released are not recalled later in the War, theyshould be deducted from this category and added to (c) below.(c) The numbers in the munitions industries will have grown during the Warby about 800,000 men and 1,500,000 women. Some of these may be retained on themanufacture of munitions or of civilian products in munition factories, but themajority will have to revert to other types of civilian employment.(d) In addition to the foregoing, amounting to about 6,000,000, who may beregarded as engaged on war-work proper, large numbers of persons, mostlywomen, are to-day replacing men who have been called up for the Forces or otherwar service from agriculture, transport, distributive services and. other industry,and from national and local government services.4. We set out in Appendix I a statement prepared in the Ministry of Labourand National Service, showing in broad industrial groups the numbers of menand women within the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Acts (i) At the outbreak of war;(ii) Expected towards the end of the War;(iii) Expected, towards the end of the War increased by those demobilised.The figures under (iii) are. of course, purely provisional, since they assume that the Armed Forces (after allowing for 500,000 battle casualties and a standingforce of 1,000,000 in the Armed Forces after the War) will have returned to theindustries from which they wei^e drawn prior to enlistment or enrolment, withoutany concurrent change in the distribution of civilian employment as it stands atthe end of the War. It is thought, however, that these figures are of value, since&apos; they indicate the magnitude and general nature of the problem.5. In some respects this problem is likely to be far more difficult after this war than after the War of 1914-18. There has been a more extensive mobilisa-tion of the nation and its resources for war on this occasion, and this, coupled with large movements of population for security reasons, and the extensive air raid damage, has already resulted in a greater dislocation of our normal civil life. The same is true of a very large part of the rest of the world, but most ofall of the Continent of Europe, and it is already clear that the resumption of normal economic activity in the world at large, and the restoration of a soundforeign trade position for this country after this War, will present unprecedenteddifficulties. On the other hand, much as the people of this and other countries will desire to begin the great task of reconstructing their civil life at once, itseems highly probable that it may not be possible to demobilise either so rapidlyor so completely as last time. Hostilities may, for example, continue for sometime against Japan after Germany and Italy have been defeated, and it may benecessary for this country to maintain larger military forces for a longer period,either as an army of occupation or as a guarantee of peace, resting, it may be,on a system of compulsory general military training. In so far as these factorsreduce the extent of demobilisation and spread it over a longer periocf, the grave difficulties of resettlement will be diminished, though the problem of maintainingmorale in the Armed Forces, referred to in paragraph 10, may be correspondinglyincreased. .6. It will be gathered from our First Interim Report that we approach theproblem of demobilisation and resettlement on the assumption that the country will need, and should be able to use, the labour, in some form or other, of all itscitizens who are able and willing to work, once the immediate dislocation of thepost-war period and the shortage of materials have been overcome. Full and sufficient grounds for that assumption are given in that report, but these shouldnot blind us to the immense difficulties of the dislocation period. The task of thefirst twelve, or perhaps eighteen, months will be the transfer of resources, andespecially labour, from the contracting occupations of war to the expandingoccupations of peace. The scale and pace of this transfer will be withoutprecedent, even in the War itself, and extensive unemployment may develop. It ishoped, and indeed believed, that such unemployment will be purely temporary,but every effort should be made to shorten the period of dislocation.
II. DEMOBILISATION.A.   The Armed Forces.7. Two months before the Armistice of November 1918 the visible approach of the end of hostilities created such unrest in the Army on the subject ofdemobilisation that it was found necessary for the Minister of Labour personally to address the troops at various advanced points in France in order to assurethem both of early release from service and of the existence of plans for placingthem in employment. The general basis of these plans was the release first ofthose men who had offers of employment. No machinery was provided, however,for checking the validity of such offers, and, when the demobilisation actuallybegan, abuses in this respect became widespread and serious unrest developed,with the result that the element of seniority had to be hastily introduced, along with liberal concessions in regard to the pay of those retained in the Forces.Even so, acts of indiscipline occurred at a later date.8. The considerations referred to in paragraph 5 above may make the demobilisation of the Armed Forces a less formidable problem this time, but itwould nevertheless be unwise not to give the greatest weight to that experience.The Interdepartmental Committee appointed to consider the machinery ofdemobilisation after this War has in fact already recommended and ministers have endorsed the recommendation that the basic principle on this occasionshould be priority of release according to age and length of service; subject,however, to the immediate release of men and women in certain special priorityclasses of limited extent to be determined by the Government, e.g., pivotalindividuals, classes with special industrial qualifications, returned prisoners ofwar and those qualifying on grounds of extreme compassion. Availability ofemployment is to give no higher title to release than priority within a man&apos;sappropriate age and service group. In their Final Report the Committeeindicate the machinery for giving effect to such priorities.9. The Committee further recommend that in deciding who should beretained in the Forces preference should be given by the Services wherever possible to those wishing to stay on. In order to reduce still further the numberof men to be retained against their will, consideration will no doubt be given to (a) the encouragement of volunteers for the Forces from those in civil life,especially the younger men in the munitions industry and the civil defence Services which are then being demobilised;(b) the continuance of conscription with the object of calling up for a limited period the younger age groups which have not seen active service.10. Assuming, as we must, that demobilisation will have to proceed in stages, there seems little doubt but that the basis of priority according to ageweighted by service is likely to commend itself to those directly concerned as onthe whole the most equitable, but it must be recognised that there is a funda-mental conflict between such a basis and the needs of industry. Generallyspeaking, it is those who have been called up last who will be needed back in industry first. This difficulty has been avoided to a very considerable extent bythe close regard paid to industrial needs in the calling up of men for the forces and in the release of men for war industries during the War, and it will befurther eased by the grant of special priority of release to pivotal individuals and selected groups. But it will not be wholly removed, and, granted that themain demobilisation must proceed according to age and service groups, the claims of industry are likely to be best met by speeding up the process in so far as theneeds of the Services and transport considerations permit. As already mentioned,this may lead to considerable, though temporary, unemployment, but the service authorities are emphatic against any slowing up of demobilisation on this account,holding that this would be most detrimental to Service morale and discipline.11. Even without such slowing up the demobilisation of the large numberof men and women who will be serving in the Forces at the Armistice and spreadover the various theatres of war is bound to take a considerable time, and the
Demobilisation Committee, in their Final Report, emphasize three considerationsas essential to the success of the scheme : (a) That all possible steps should be taken, by training and otherwise, toassist men and women released from the Forces in finding suitablecivil employment as soon as possible.(b) That the policy of the Government, both internal and external, should bedirected to the provision of full employment, so that men and womenretained in the Forces under the scheme of priorities will not be placed at a serious disadvantage in comparison with those released early fromthe Forces, from Civil Defence and from war industries.(c) That the scheme of demobilisation and the general resettlement policy ofthe Government are fully explained in good time to the personnel ofthe Forces and to the general public, every form of publicity andpersuasion being employed to secure their general acceptance.B.   Civil Defence Workers.12. The Civil Defence workers bear a certain resemblance to the armed forces inasmuch as they are under some measure of direct Government control;but, except for the new National Fire Service and the Civil Defence Reserve(Regional Mobile Columns), they are technically in the service of some hundreds of Local Authorities. The majority serve on a part-time unpaid basis, havingother means of livelihood, and will, as Civil Defence Workers, clearly form no part of the demobilisation and resettlement problem.13. Exclusive of regular police, the whole-time paid strength of the Fire,Police War Reserve and general Civil Defence Services at present is in theneighbourhood of 313.000, as stated in paragraph 3. This total is, however, in process o&apos;f reduction by a substantial amount as the result of the decision ofApril last to release certain whole-time personnel from the Civil Defence services for employment in war industry.(a) A.R.P. Services.14. The whole-time membership of the A.R.P. and Casualty Services(Wardens. Rescue, Decontamination, Report and Control, Ambulance. First aid and Nurses) at present comprise about 92,000 men and 46,000 women. The factthat they are to be found distributed throughout the country and mostly in smallcontingents should make their reabsorption into industry relatively easy.(b) Police and Fire Services.15. The position in regard to the Police and Fire Services is somewhat moredifficult. There are at the present time some 41,500 whole-time PoliceAuxiliaries : most of them are additional to the peace-time establishment, buta considerable number are filling vacancies due to natural wastage and the lossof regular policemen to the Armed Forces, and, to a small extent, to industry.Normal recruitment has been suspended during the War, but the shortage isbeing temporarily relieved by the retention of suitable men due for retirement.Even after the return of those in the Forces there will be many vacancies in thepermanent estalishment to be filled, and it may be that conditions immediatelyafter the War will require a strengthened Police Force. It will therefore be necessary to retain many of the Auxiliaries for a time, but it is unlikely that itwill be possible to offer peace-time posts to more than a small proportion ofthem except perhaps on a short-term basis to tide over special post-wartransitional needs because most of them are over 30 and the recruitment ofyounger men will be essential.16. The position of the Fire Service is somewhat similar : by the end of theWar the number of ex-regular firemen included in the whole-time establishmentof the Service will be well below future requirements, and it will be necessaryto retain a proportion of the auxiliary personnel in order to cover normal fire risksuntil the regular Service can be brought up to strength. The peace-time whole-time strength was between 15,000 and 16,000.  The total strength of whole-time
firemen and officers is at present about 105,000, which includes about 8,000ex-regular personnel, but it is expected that this establishment will be reducedto 97,000 in the near future through the release of firemen to war industry andthe return of Class W Army Reservists to the Colours. The strength of whole-time firewomen, which is at present 28,000, is expected at the same time to increase to 33,000. The post-war organisation of the Service has yet to be determined,but it is clear that, as in Police Service, there will be a much smaller peace-timeestablishment than the war-time strength, and that only a small proportion ofthe temporary, war-time, personnel will be absorbed into the permanentestablishment.17. In the case of both Services, many more are likely to want to stay onthan can be absorbed, and it is suggested that at the appropriate time the two services should be told that those wishing to leave should apply for dischargeand that in the case of the National Fire Service they will, subject to the exigencies of the Service, be released forthwith. In the case of the Police it may have to be indicated that a proportion only can be released. The vast majority of them will be living at home and in touch with the industrial life of their areas and,like the A.R.P. workers, should have little difficulty in finding employment.C.   Civilian Workers.18. Regarded as an executive act of Government, demobilisation, in its application to civilian workers, would mean the release of those held in theirpresent civil employment by statutory authority, whether the National service acts or the Defence Regulations, but in its wider connotation it would extend to the discharge of all those civilians who will not be carrying on their presentjobs after the War. There is, of course, a very large number of workers held inspecified employments, e.g., in engineering, mining, shipbuilding, docks, and building and contracting, under Essential Works Orders, who are in factpursuing their normal occupations, and it may be presumed that a high propor-^tion of these will continue in such employment if work is available for them.These will present no demobilisation problem, though there may be a problem ofmaintaining employment in their industry. On the other hand, there are many people now working voluntarily in industry especially those replacing men called to the Forces who will be discharged as soon as the normal type of labour is once more available.19. From the point of view of demobilisation three classes of civilianworkers may be broadly distinguished : (a) those engaged on war operations which have no ready application to peace-time production, e.g., the filling of shells;(b) those engaged on operations which, though at present applied to war purposes, can be converted to peace-time production, e.g., much ofthe engineering and building industries;(c) those engaged on making goods substantially the same as will be neededafter the War, e.g., clothing, merchant shipbuilding and motor vehicles.20. The Armistice will find us with a vast continuing programme of armament production with work in all stages of completion. There will, ofcourse, still be a demand for munitions, dependent on the general militarysituation. In order to guarantee the peace on the lines foreshadowed in the atlantic Charter it will be necessary to provide for the future needs of our ownpost-war forces, and probably to re-equip the forces of other Governments. Itwill be a matter for decision how far the progressive evolution of new types ofarmaments shall be continued for these purposes and how far they shall beprovided for out of the stocks that will then be available. On any reasonableforecast, however, the need for munitions will be very greatly reduced. Howrapid the reduction is will depend on how the War ends.Much will then depend on the extent to which it is practicable to plan the conversion of war production factories, whether private or State-owned, to peaceproduction and the rate at which the plans can be carried out. Little difficultywill arise in regard to those making goods substantially the same as will be needed by the civilian population after the War.&apos; On the other hand, operations under
(a) in the preceding paragraph should clearly be reduced as rapidly as possible tothe level of post-war demand. The most fruitful field for planning will befound in the conversion to civil production, especially for export, of buildings,plant and machine tools in the engineering and allied industries, at presentmaking munitions of war. The time necessarily involved in such a change-overis often long and where materials can be made available without detriment to more essential needs, it is desirable to avoid a break in employment by dove-tailing war and peace production This is a subject with which we shall deal inthe later report forecast in paragraph 1 above, but it may be noted here that therate of demobilisation in war production factories, depending as it does on thecontrollable rate of execution of contracts, appears to offer scope for the planned and orderly conversion of an important part of industry from war to peace.21. However vigorous may be the action to provide alternative employmentin the war production factories, it will clearly be impossible to give permanent employment for more than a fraction of their existing personnel, and the question arises whether Government action should be taken to control the exodus of thosewho sooner or later will have to be discharged. Probably a high proportion ofthose who have gone into industry during the War will wish to depart the momentit is over; many others will have work awaiting them elsewhere; still more will be anxious to leave as opportunities of permanent employment present themselves.Unless, therefore, some measure of compulsion is exercised, there is bound to bea large drift away from many of the factories after the Armistice which willrender it more difficult to organise employment for those who remain. Thequestion of continuing for a time after the War the powers of the Ministryof Labour and National Service to hold persons in specified employment is closely linked with that of retaining such powers in order to guide labour into the rightchannels for meeting the peace-time needs of the nation. This we discuss inparagraphs 25-28 below, but we may say at once that we doubt whether generalaction of this character for either purpose will be politically possible even if itwere economically desirable.22. Even so, the question of discharge according to some system of prioritieswill arise in regard to those civilian workers who desire to stay on but cannot begiven permanent employment. All work, even in munition establishments, willnot -cease abruptly at the Armistice, but, as already stated, there should obviously be an immediate slowing down of production for which no continuing demand canbe envisaged by stopping overtime, Sunday work, night shifts, &amp;c, so as to spread the available work over a longer period. In so far as government establishments are concerned, any workers urgently needed by other industry might be discharged first, single men might be discharged before married men, andso on. It will be difficult to enforce similar action in regard to staffs underprivate control that had to be discharged at the end of the War, but a considerable measure of voluntary co-operation could probably be secured by suitableconsultation.III. RESETTLEMENT.A.   Preparations for Peace.23. Labour Priorities. Both in the reports of the DemobilisationCommittee dealing with the demobilisation of the Allied Forces and in the earlier part of this report the importance is accepted of giving priority of release to individuals and groups who are essential to the resettlement of industry on a peace footing. This would clearly conflict in practice with the principle of release according to age and length of service. The Demobilisation Committeeemphasise the importance of so limiting the grant of special priority on industrialgrounds as not to undermine the general rule of demobilisation in order of age and length of service. Only workers on whom the employment of a substantial number of other workers depends should be classed as &quot;pivotal,&quot; and it is obviously important that there should be no delay in their release. Both inregard to such workers and also in regard to the industrial or occupational groups to be given immediate release, the Demobilisation Committee recommend a procedure based upon that for the release of military personnel for civil employ-ment during the War. General instructions would have to be drawn up by anational authority which might take the form of an interdepartmental committee
(like the war-time Man-Power Committee) under the chairmanship of theParliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Labour. Among the grounds forearlier release which would have to be considered by this committee, production for export should rank high. In addition to industrial requirements, considera-tion must be given to the urgency of providing or restoring or extending social services, for example, education and housing. The interdepartmental committeeshould be able to draw up instructions based on the various criteria, and if thisproposal is accepted it would be desirable to appoint the committee as soon asconsultations with industry had reached an advanced stage. The activities ofsuch a committee must clearly be based on the fullest information of the typelikely to be yielded by the enquiries mentioned in paragraph 1, relevant to theprobable post-war demands for labour in the various industries and as to theman-power that will be available.24. Planning for post-war production. In certain fields it may be possibleeven during the War to take action which will be of great, value to industry inshortening the post-war period of dislocation, either by improving methods of recruitment of personnel or by preparing plans for post-war production. special attention is, we understand, being paid to the recruitment and training of boysfor the mining and the building industries. As the peak of war production isreached and the need for scientists, research workers, draughtsmen, architects, &amp;c,falls off, it should be possible, without prejudice to the war effort, to allowindustries to divert some of their research staff to post-war planning and to thepreparation of designs, production and sale plans, jigs and tools, &amp;c. Thiswould be of particular advantage in the export industries. The matter would,of course, need to be handled with great care to avoid giving rise to suspicioneither at home or abroad that the Government and employers were diverting their attention and energies from the War.B.   Direction of Labour.25. It is inevitable that the survey to be made of the post-war labour require-ments of industry in relation to the available labour supply should show the needfor very considerable changes in its pre-war distribution. The great changes that the War will bring in the political and economic make-up of the world, andthe vital need for this country to expand its exports of goods and services, willimpose on us a difficult task of readjustment. The heavy world demand for goods in the period immediately following the War will present opportunities for winning a footing in new markets such as may not recur for a very long time,and we should be prepared to make the fullest use of them. This involves notonly the careful drawing up of plans by industry in advance to which reference has been made but the&apos; guidance of labour and other resources into the rightchannels of employment when the time comes.26. We have already expressed the view in our First Interim Report thatit will be necessary to continue into the post-war period much of the powers ofcontrol over material resources, and the question arises how far it may be necessaryalso to retain the powers of direction in regard to labour exercised by the Ministerof Labour and National Service during the War. If these powers are relinquishedand war workers are released quite freely there will no doubt be a period ofdislocation during which workers will be changing from one job to another, butthis period is likely to be shortened rather than lengthened by the speedy releaseof large numbers; this policy may therefore serve the national interest better inthe long run. If, on the other hand, powers of direction are exercised, they mustof course cover as they do during the War not only the power to direct aperson to take.up a specified employment, but also the power to compel him toretain it. The continuance of such industrial conscription into peace-time islikely to arouse the strongest political opposition, and it is clear that it wouldbe accepted, if at all, only if an overwhelming case for it could be made out.We doubt for two reasons whether such an overwhelming case could he made out.27. In the first place, the conditions under which such powers would fall to be exercised after the War are likely to be very complex, rapidly variable, and difficult to forecast with any precision. Industrial conscription in such circum-stances might tend to introduce a rigidity into the economic system which mighthinder instead of helping its speedy adjustment. During the War, a large[24572] G
number of men and women have been collected in ones and twos for the war industries from small firms and scattered individual occupations in an immensevariety of trades and industries, and it would be extremely difficult for theMinistry of Labour and National Service to carry out the reverse process quickly.The quickest way to get these persons back into civil life will be to set them free.In any case, the thousands of small employers, who will have to feel their wayvery carefully under post-war conditions, can hardly be expected to commit themselves in the matter of labour needs in a way that would enable the ministry to organise supply in advance. Yet speed is essential; and detailed administrative arrangements designed with the best intentions to guide labour back into peace-time work might well impede the numerous complicated adjustments that willbe necessary, and in consequence slow down the whole process of resettlement.28. In the second place, in so far as the Government would feel justifiedin taking responsibility for the allocation of labour under such conditions, webelieve that it will be able during the critical period to exert sufficient influence (i) by the control over imports of materials, through shipping and foreign exchange;(ii) by the control of internal distribution of essential materials;(iii) by schemes of training in new occupations backed up by suitablepropaganda and, it may be, by definite undertakings on the part oftrainees to stay in their new occupations for a specified period.Further influence of a general character will be afforded by the post-war useof Government-owned factories and plant, by the power of the Government to influence capital investment, and by the provision of financial inducements ona more generous scale than before the War for workers to move to areas and to industries which offer the greater employment prospects.C.   Reinstatement in Former Employment.29. In any event it is to be expected that a high proportion of those falling to be discharged either from the Forces or from war work will wish to return totheir old home and their previous employment, and many will have a statutoryright of reinstatement. In the pre-war Military Training Act provision wasmade for the compulsory reinstatement of those called up for the six months&apos;military training under &quot;the Act an obviously reasonable provision. When theNational Service (Armed Forces) Act was being drafted a similar provision was at first felt to be inappropriate, as neither the length of the War nor thecircumstances of its ending could be foreseen. Subsequently, however, it wasdecided that its inclusion would facilitate the passage of the Bill through parliament, and in due course it became Section 14 of the Armed Forces Act, 1939.30. That, part of Section 14 of the Armed Forces Act, 1939, as amended by subsequent Acts, which relates to the employees liability to reinstate, is reproduced in Appendix II. It will be noted that the rights of reinstatementdo not apply to the large numbers of men and women who have volunteered. Onthe other hand, they have been extended to men and women compulsorily enrolledin the Civil Defence Forces and to women enrolled in the Armed Forces.31. There has been considerable discussion during the War as to whether these rights of reinstatement should be extended to men and women transferredto munition production, especially those transferred compulsorily. There is no need here to set out the arguments for and against such an extension; sufficeit to say that the rights have not been so extended.32. It cannot be disputed that the existence of reinstatement rights fora portion of those due for demobilisation will be a considerable embarrassment.It is hardly practicable at this date to level up rights by retrospective legislation.On the other hand, although the Act provides so many loopholes that evasionby unwilling employers will not be difficult, it is understood that the existing rights are highly prized by many of those to whom they apply, and they have of course recently been reaffirmed&apos;in the National Service Act, 1941.  As regards
older men who may need the rights most, it may be observed that they will benefit considerably by the decision to give considerable weight to age in determining order of release from the Armed Forces. But as regards the younger men and also those more recently posted to the Forces, employers mayplead that, if they cannot get their ex-employees back at the time when thevneed their services, they are thereby morally absolved from the obligation ofreinstatement-though there is no limitation to the period of the rights inthe Act. A young man conseribed in the last month of the war and retainedcompulsorily in an Army of Occupation for (say) three years would be able onreturn to civil life to make a claim to reinstatement, and the Act implies thathis employer should not fill his job on a permanent basis during the whole period.There is no corresponding duty on the man to return to a post kept open for him. This whole question therefore may prove a source of considerableunsettlement and controversy. It is one important question amongst many others on which consultations at the appropriate time with the british employers&apos; Confederation and the Trades Union Congress should be productiveof good results. The difficulties of making good the promise of reinstatementcould be frankly disclosed and indications given that, while the Government forits part would &quot;fulfil the promise as far as practicable, the chief reliance wouldbe placed on measures for maintaining a high level of employment so as tomake it less necessary for those having rights of reinstatement to insist onexercising them and to make it less difficult for employers having obligations of reinstatement to comply with them.33. Concentrated Industries. In industries dealt with under the schemesfor Concentration of Industry, arrangements have already been made to keeplists of the names of workers transferred to other employment through theEmployment Exchanges, so as to facilitate their return after the War to their previous firms. It has been generally recognised that orderly arrangements ofthis sort will be to the mutual advantage of the firms and the workers, thoughit is to be expected that some of the establishments which have been closed will never return to their pre-war production. Moreover, it is only a proportionof the workers who have taken advantage of these arrangements for registration.When the end of hostilities is seen to be approaching, all the industries dealtwith under concentration schemes might be asked to consider their future plans,with a view to giving as early warning as possible to any workers who are not likely to be able to return to their old industry and should therefore seek some new type of employment.34. Reinstatement as affecting Women. At the end of the War there willprobably be round about two million women- to be discharged from the women&apos;services or employed on jobs which will shortly come to an end. There will, inaddition, be large numbers of women who have been engaged as war-timesubstitutes for men in occupations outside the munitions industries (as, forexample, land workers, bus conductors, railway porters and clerks in government offices and business houses). The latter will tend to be discharged graduallyover a considerable period as the men whom they have replaced return from theForces or from war industry. Very few women will have rights of reinstatementunder Section 14 of the Armed Forces Act, but considerable numbers will expectreinstatement under the Concentration of Industry arrangements referred to inparagraph 33.35. It is impossible to estimate the extent to which women engaged on war work will wish to remain in wage-earning employment. Probably a largeproportion of those who were not in wage-earning employment before the Warwill wish to revert to private life; but, on general grounds, it is not unlikelythat one effect of the War will be an expansion of the employment of women or,at any rate, a demand from women for such an expansion. After the last War,roughly half the new women entrants into all occupations during the war periodremained in employment until the slump of 1920-21. Thereafter the proportionof women to men &quot;gainfully occupied&quot; was no higher than before the War,although there was a considerable redistribution of occupied women- as between different occupations post-war and pre-war. In so far as the employment ofwomen did not show the rise that might have been expected, this was probably due mainly to economic circumstances, but partly also to Government policy asexemplified by the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act and the discharge ofwomen from Government Departments in order to provide vacancies forex-Service men.
36. Women are playing a far more important part in the present War,especially in the Armed Forces, and they have come under measures of compulsionsubstantially similar to those applying to men. This may well result in theirestablishing a claim to equality of treatment except in so far as they may beaffected by the policy of restoration of pre-war trade union practices to whichthe Government is fully committed. The extent to which this issue will arisewill depend very much on the general level of employment. If when the bulkof the Forces come to be demobilised there is widespread unemployment, a strong demand is likely to be put- forward for some degree of preference to be accorded to ex-Service men, and ex-Service women may not unreasonably claim to share in that preference. If, however, as we anticipate, a short period of dislocationin industry is followed by some years, at any rate, of good employment, a demandfor women workers may arise in certain industries in excess of the numberwishing to stay in regular work, especially if women continue to be employed ata lower wage than men. In either event the Government will be expected to givea lead as far as its own services are concerned.D.   Resettlement in New Employment.(i) Machinery of Placing.37. Before the War the work of the Employment Exchanges was mainly confined to manual workers, but the raising of the non-manual workers&apos; insurancelimit to  420 per annum and the difficulties of demobilisation will probably leadprofessional and technical workers to rely to an increasing extent on the help ofthe Ministry of Labour and National Service. Not only has the machinery of theExchanges been greatly strengthened during the War to meet the many new and heavy demands made upon it, but recently a new Appointments Department hasbeen established, absorbing the former Central Register and the SupplementaryRegister, to deal with all persons, whether they have served in the Forces or not,who possess qualifications superior to those normally expected of persons withinthe-range of insurable employment. If openings are available, it is believed thatthis machinery will be able to meet the demand that will be made upon it afterthe War for placing men and women in touch with offers of employment forwhich they are qualified.(ii) Training.38. From the outbreak of war in September 1939 up to the 30th September,1942, 217,598 persons have been trained in the Government Training Centres, or,under the Emergency Training Scheme, in Technical Colleges and in individual firms under the supervision of the Ministry of Labour and National Service. Ofthese, 80,391 were women, the training of whom commenced in January 1941,14,923 were serving soldiers and 3,280 were serving sailors who were trained forwork in the Forces. Practically all the civilians were trained in engineering orshipbuilding occupations, and a large proportion of the women have been placedin aircraft manufacture. Training under the Ministry of Labour&apos;s scheme,however, is to be regarded only as a necessary supplement to training in industrial establishments; it is estimated that over 800,000 persons, or four times the number of civilians trained under the Ministry&apos;s scheme, have been so trained.39.   In so far as employment is available it is to be expected that industry will provide its own training facilities for its employees, where training is       necessary, but it appears to be probable that there will be need for the continua-tion of Government Training Schemes to meet both personal and industrial needs.The following are circumstances in which -this may be desirable : (a) While a certain number of juveniles may be able to commence trainingduring the War for an industry such as Building, in which there willbe a large volume of employment available after the War, it isprobable that intensive training will be necessary to provide thenumber of operatives able to undertake work in the skilledoccupations.   Such training will not produce fully skilled operatives
unless prolonged, but a short course under proper instruction willenable the trainee to make rapid progress on production work.Discussions are already taking place as to the training facilities required for this purpose. The review of probable employment inother industries may reveal other occupations for which suchpreliminary training may expedite the rate at which the industry can reach its full employment capacity.(b) It has always been the case that Government training has been confined to occupations in which employment is available. Those trainedhave an immediate production value to employers, and their chanceof getting employment is greatly increased as a result of training,especially when, as is now the practice, that training is completed in actual production. A large number of those in the Forces have hadno industrial training at all, and may find it difficult to getemployment suited to their capacity unless facilities for training areavailable.(c) Many Service men will have their chances of good employment greatlyincreased by a refresher course, and others who have had only a partial training will be assisted by a short intensive course.(d) A large number of those who have been employed on munitions work willrequire retraining in another occupation.The Ministry of Labour and National Service has had a wide experienceduring the War of providing for training and will be able at short notice to make provision for post-war requirements. As has been the case during the War,these arrangements Avould be made in close association with industry and, asfar as possible, it would be desirable to secure the co-operation of industry inthis field. In many industries training must take place in industrial estabiish-ments with or without the assistance of training in technical schools.40. The cases referred to in the preceding paragraph are those of personswho will readily recognise their need of training as an essential preliminary tothe securing of suitable employment. There will, however, be a further problemof workers adequately equipped for their old occupation who will not findopenings in that old occupation in the place where they normally lived and whowill either have to move elsewhere or in some cases transfer to a new occupation,or in some cases both move and transfer. In view of the hopes with which theworkers will start of re-employment at the old occupation in the old home, andof the natural reluctance of any particular individual to recognise that he willnot succeed, this problem will be slow to show itself and it will probably notappear until the later stages of resettlement. It will, however, be of considerable importance both to the completion of resettlement and to the prevention of thedevelopment of chronic structural unemployment that arrangements should bein readiness to deal with it as a matter of urgency when it does appear. such arrangements would consist partly of financial assistance towards expenses ofremoval and partly of training facilities.41. Training in general, but especially in the class of case discussed in thepreceding paragraph, is so unsatisfactory as to be almost impracticable unless there is a definite prospect of employment on its completion. Power to compelit when there is no such prospect would be useless and harmful. Moreover,under such conditions resistance from those already in an industry is likely to be an effective barrier. On the other hand, if employment is known to be available, it is unlikely that resistance will be encountered or that any form of compulsion willbe necessary. Should the need arise, however, it would no doubt be possible toget support for a policy which ma.kes training a condition of the payment ofUnemployment Insurance Benefit, when employment was not likely to be otherwiseavailable.42. It is desirable, therefore, that, as soon as is practicable, an estimateshould be made of the probable employment position in the various industries afterthe War in order that consultations with industrial representatives may take place and plans may be made, both by the Ministry of Labour and National Serviceand by industries themselves, for any training that may be necessary. in industries in which employment will be delayed by the change-over from war to peace conditions, the training period might with advantage oe extended both toincrease the skill of those concerned and also to keep them from idleness.
(iii) Resettlement of Special Classes.43. Special problems will arise with regard to the resettlement of certainclasses of workers and some of these are already the subject of special examination by the Departments concerned : (a) Rehabilitation and Resettlement of Disabled Men. The preparationof comprehensive measures for the rehabilitation, training and resettlement of disabled persons has been remitted to an Inter-departmental committee under the chairmanship of the Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry ofLabour and National Service (Mr. Tomlinson); their terms of reference coverthose disabled from any cause and not only war casualties.(b) Further Education or Training for Demobilised Personnel, &amp;c. There will be many whose education or training for business or the professions was interrupted by the War and others who, by reason of their war-time experience, have shown themselves suitable for professional orhigher managerial posts in the post-war world. A Committee under sir Alan Barlow&apos;s chairmanship has recently reported on &quot; the plans whichshould be made to enable suitable persons, both men and women, who have served in the Armed Forces or in the Civil Defence Services, to obtain thefurther education or training necessary to equip them for appropriate occu-pations in civil life after the War.&quot; It will be noted that the terms ofreference of this Committee did not cover persons who have served in industry,but these have recently been extended and the Committee are re-examining the question from this angle.(c) Further Measures for the Re-establishment of Ex-Service Officersand Men. In their Final Report the Demobilisation Committee call attentionto the need for some further machinery to give to officers and men seeking to re-establish themselves in civil life guidance, and possibly in some casesfinancial assistance also, of a kind, rather outside the present scope of the appointments Department of the Ministry of Labour and National Service,and&apos; the plans are being formulated by the Barlow Committee. They pointout that in this War large numbers of youths have joined the Forces,especially the Royal Air Force, on leaving school, have received theircommissions at an early age, and will, on demobilisation, receive substantialgratuities. While not feeling justified in making any specific recommenda-tion they say that &apos;&apos; an organisation which could give expert advice as to theprospects and conditions of success in various spheres and could keep in touch,lending a helping hand at times when things went awry, would in our viewdo much to prevent a repetition of the grievous wastage and disappointmentsthat constituted a reproach to the nation after the last War.&quot;(d) The Establishment or Re-establishment of Persons in Bxisiness ontheir own Account. The Final Report of the Demobilisation Committeesuggests as grounds for priority on demobilisation the risk of a businessbeing lost as a result of the further absence of the owner or manager. the wider aspects of the establishment or re-establishment of persons in business on their own account are more property treated as a part of IndustrialDemobilisation on which the Committee hope to make a further InterimReport at a later date.(e) Apprentices. Many apprentices have been reserved from calling upuntil their apprenticeship has been completed, while arrangements have beenmade &quot;that others should count a period in a tradesman&apos;s job in the armed forces as completing their apprenticeship. Nevertheless, in the non-metalindustries a large number of apprentices will have been posted to the Forcesin the middle of their apprenticeship and will return as grown men withadult needs and commitments. The Minister of Labour and National service has already drawn the attention of the industries concerned, to this problem and asked them to examine it and report to him on the way in which theythink it should be handled.E.   Preference to Ex-Service Personnel.44. After the last War special financial help was given to Ex-Service mento bridge the gap between demobilisation and employment, and there was generalagreement that they and especially the disabled men should be given a
preference in relation to employment generally and particularly to employmentin the Government service. Although civilians have been exposd to more danger in this War than in the last, and although many men have been prevented fromthe commencement of the War from joining the Forces, public sentiment is more easily aroused on behalf of men and women who have served, in the Armed Forces.Also, notwithstanding the recent decision to give post-war credits to those in theForces, it will be argued that those who have remained in civilian work have had better opportunities of saving money and of accumulating a post-war creditthrough their income tax payments. At the moment public sentiment would be specially favourable to those who have served their country in the air and on thesea, whether in the Royal Navy or in the Merchant Navy, but the future courseof operations may well create an almost equally strong feeling in regard to theArmy.45. Preference in Employment. The preference accorded to Ex-Servicemen after the last War proved an embarrassment in many ways. The political pressure exercised by the British Legion and the Association of Ex-Service CivilServants led to Government pledges which had unfortunate results in the long-run. The War Veterans&apos; Movement in the United States of America had stillmore dangerous implications. Reference has already been made to various ways in which Ex-Service men are likely to obtain special assistance after the War infitting themselves for and obtaining civilian employment, and it is suggested thatthe proper course for the Government to adopt in this matter is to pursue thepolicy of helping Ex-Service men and women to take their place in civilian life ontheir merits rather than to concede them by preferential treatment positionswhich they are not properly qualified to fill. There will certainly be a widespreaddesire on the part of the public to give them assistance which may in factconstitute a substantial measure of preference, but it is important that this shouldnot find expression in definite Government pledges which, however carefullyworded, will be the subject of continuing political pressure for an ever wider-interpretation, and in view of the Government&apos;s position as a large employer oflabour will have repercussions far outside the sphere of Government employment.As the matter may be pressed on the Governments attention even before the endof hostilities, it is desirable that it should be considered in good time and a definite policy adopted of resistance to any proposals which may have the effect- of reducing industrial or administrative efficiency.46. Special Unemployment Pay. Before 1920 the UnemploymentInsurance Scheme only applied to engineering, building and shipbuilding andother industries engaged in the production of munitions and war materials;though a great part of the monetary relief available to persons unemployed wasgiven by way of a special out-of-work donation. In 1920 the UnemploymentInsurance Scheme was widely extended and since then its scope has been further increased and the rate and conditions of benefit have been steadily improved.Moreover, a further review is now being undertaken by the Beveridge Committee,which may well result in bringing the rates of benefit still more closely intoaccord with present ideas of a proper minimum maintenance standard. Howeverstrong may be the claims of ex-Service men to special treatment, there can belittle doubt that it would be very difficult to limit any special rate of benefit thatmight be accorded them either to the immediate resettlement period or indeed tothe ex-Service men : it would be made the ground for a permanent levelling up allround. If, therefore, the claims of ex-Service men are held to warrant further financial recognition over and above the post-war- credits referred to above, it is most desirable that they should be met in some other way that will not prejudice the stability of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme.F.   Housing in Relation to Resettlement.47. One of the problems which will arise immediately after the War inconnexion with the resettlement of men and women in new peace-time employment will be the availability of housing accommodation for them. This is likely tohave an important bearing both on the return of industry to areas which have suffered severely from air attack and also on the use which can be made ofGovernment-owned factories. The capacity of the building industry after theWar is likely to be severely limited for a time both by lack of trained personnel and by shortage of essential materials, and if essential needs are to havepreference it will be necessary to continue in some form the system of licensing ofbuilding operations, especially if the absorption of workers in particularlocations is likely to be hindered by lack of housing accommodation.
G.   civil Liabilities.48. Many of the normal processes of law in relation to civil liabilitieshave been suspended, or severely modified, during the War and its terminationwill leave a mass of problems to be cleared up. In regard to men and women inthe Forces the War Service Grants Scheme administered by the Ministry ofPensions has been giving substantial relief, but it will probably be necessary atthe end of hostilities to deal with civilian liabilities on a more comprehensivebasis. We understand that the matter is under examination by the Ministry ofLabour and National Service.IV.-CONCLUSION.49. As pointed out at the beginning of this Report, the demobilisation and resettlement of labour is dependent upon and must proceed concurrently with the demobilisation and resettlement of industry, and on some issues decisions can onlybe taken properly on a review of both aspects of the change-over. There are,however, a number of questions discussed in the course of the foregoing Report onwhich it would seem to be both possible and desirable to reach provisional conclu-sions as a working hypothesis on which to carry further the work of reconstruction problems, and it is on this basis that we submit the following brief and tentativenotes on the major points of policy arising on this Report.50. -(a) While there is reason to expect some years of good employmentsupervening on the change-over from war to peace, the change-over itself maybe a period of far greater dislocation with heavier unemployment than thecorresponding period after the last War.(b) An attempt to reduce this unemployment by deliberately prolonging theprocess of demobilisation, both military and civil, is likely to be attended with very great difficulties and to delay the process of industrial readjustment. Onthe&quot; whole, it would appear that the national interest will best be served by (i) letting military demobilisation proceed as rapidly as Service needs,transport and the machinery of discharge will permit;(ii) by not attempting to hold civilian workers for whom continuing employ-ment is not available;(iii) by controlling, where possible, the rate of execution of war contracts with a view to the orderly conversion of industry to peace-time production.(c) Assuming, then, that the Government policy is to be one of speedy change-over, even at the cost of temporary unemployment, all possible steps in additionto rapid demobilisation should be taken to reduce the period and extent ofdislocation.  These will be of two kinds (i) action designed to speed up the provision of employment;(ii) action to make suitable labour available therefor.(d) Under the former heading the Board of Trade and other departments are investigating, in consultation where necessary with the industries concerned,the post-war prospects and problems of individual industries, including those that have undergone concentration during the War (paragraphs 1 and 25),and in particular are giving thought to the problem of converting to peace-timeuse many of the factories now engaged on war production (paragraph 20). Ourdetailed suggestions in this field will in due course be submitted in a furtherInterim Report.(e) Such investigation and planning may be expected to afford much usefulinformation as to the post-war labour needs of industry, indicating probableshortages and surpluses and the scope for useful Government interventiondirected to making suitable labour available. It is with such action that thepresent report is principally concerned. In the course of it we have referred tothe steps now being taken to increase the recruitment of juveniles for the building and coal-mining industries and we have suggested that action should also betaken during the war on the following lines, in each case as soon as the generalsituation makes it practicable and timely : (i) The constitution of an inter-departmental committee to decide the criteria to be adopted in accepting claims for the early release of
special categories and individuals whose prior demobilisation isessential to a rapid revival of peace-time production (paragraph 23).(ii) Consultation  with the British Employers&apos; Confederation and   theTrades Union Congress as to action to be taken in regard to&quot;reinstatement.&quot;   (Paragraphs 29-32.)(iii) Formulation of Government policy to be adopted in regard to theprobable claims of ex-Service personnel for preference in employment.(Paragraph 45.)(iv) A survey of the housing situation with special reference to theprobable needs of those who will be engaged in post-war productionand the formulation of plans to secure that essential needs are provided for.   (Paragraph 47.)(/) After the end of hostilities, with the same general objective of speedingthe change-over : (i) Pivotal men and industrial groups determined under (e) (i) above shouldbe released from the Forces and war industries as early as possible.(Paragraphs 22 and 23.)(ii) Such training, &amp;c, should be provided for ex-Service personnel and civilian workers as is needed to fit them to take their place in industry.   (Paragraphs 38-42.)(g) It will be of great importance that the national resources, both humanand material, should after the War be used to the best advantage in view notonly of the requirements of the home market but also of the vital need tore-establish the export trades (and our shipping position). For this purpose it will no doubt be desirable to continue for a time many of the existing controls over the importation, distribution and prices of essential materials, over foreign exchange, over capital investment and over actual production and supply. Muchinfluence can be exerted in this way over the post-war distribution of labourwithout raising the serious issues, both political and economic, that would be involved in any attempt to continue after the War the powers of industrialconscription at present vested in the Ministry of Labour and National Service.Such influence would, be supplemented by any action taken by the Governmentto convert war factories to peace production and by any special measures to recruit labour for particular industries, whether by special training schemes,for adults or juveniles, coupled, it might be, with financial inducements, ormerely by general propaganda.   (Paragraphs 25-28.)51. Finally, in view of the possibility that the change-over in industry may be attended with considerable unemployment, it is of the highest importance that the public should be fully prepared for this contingency,&quot; informed as tothe causes and as to the probability of its lasting only a short time and givengood ground for confidently expecting thereafter years of good employment. Inour view it is not too early even now to begin this process. Otherwise, if thistemporary unemployment assumes considerable&quot; proportions, there will be widespread fear of a repetition of the slump that set in in 1921 wage-earnersare now much more &apos;&apos; unemployment conscious &apos;&apos; than they were after the last war and irresistible pressure may&apos;lead to heavy &quot; pump priming &quot; expenditure by the State which, if undertaken, would in all probability be beginning to take effect at about the same time that the pent-up demand for goods of all kindswas leading to intense general activity. This conjunction of economic forces might well make it impossible to adhere to the policy of price stabilisation towhich we attach so much importance. It is of the highest importance that inthe period immediately following the war Government action to promoteemployment should be directed primarily to the speedy resumption of industryand trade in normal channels, any supplementary measures that it may bedeemed necessary to undertake being of such a character that they can be discontinued at short notice should inflationary tendencies begin to develop.Signed on behalf of the Official Committee,-     A.

Some of theso will have been drawn from the non-insured population. The figures do not take account of the redistribution of the civil populationupon the cessation of hostilities, and serve, therefore, only to give a general indication ofthe character and magnitude of the problem of resettlement.(6) Changes now in contemplation may reduco the total number under Building and civil engineering in Section B to about 500,000.
