4-      After 3-4 months in bed he refused for several months further to go out of doors and in consequence becameunhealthy looking;, but on careful examination he showedno signs of physical disease05o      His mental state became worse.    He developedhysterical and emotional crises., suffered from sleeplessnessbut refused all sedatives for fear of poisonings6o      This fixed delusional idea of poisoning has persisted;,though at times it is more in the back-groundo    He had&apos;insisted upon having someone to eat with him or else to tastehis food at every mealo    He had refused to touch his foodparcels from Berlin saying that he might have enemies there too07o Twice he has had periods of mental improvement andthese seem to correspond to some extent to periods of &quot;betterwar news for Germany0So     Throughout he has given evidence of a child-likeconceit of outlook and of a feeling of self-importance9o     He has aoparently/^been in the habit of consulting-chiropractors and other unorthodox healers in connection withhis health in addition to medical men and on his arrival hispockets were&apos; filled with a variety of medicaments?The general conclusion drawn by the leadingPsychiatrist   who has had him constantly under observationthroughout the whole period is as follows&quot;Hess is a man of good intelligence but of poorcharacter and personality0    He had certainly been over-anxiousand &quot;neurotic1 earlier in life,,   Whilst under observation herehe has shown definite delusions and for more than half histime has been unable to control them and has in fact beensuffering from a sparanoid1 psychosisa-1-ijinco Hess3 arrival in this country he has all thetine bee,i u/ider medical supervision and has been closelyobserved by Psychiatrists who have been constantly with hin.,From the beginning it was reported by these skilledobservers that JI ;ss -/as a man of peculiar and difficultpersonality with mental abnormalities which have varied indegree from time to time     The following summary of reportsgives the progressive history of Hess1  state of healtholc      C i arrival in Scotland he was physically fit apartfrom the bruises9 etc resulting from his landings-20      Shortly after he complained of insomnia anddepression and had the characteristics of a depressed personsufficiently marked to make precautions against suicidenecessary,He v/as suspicious of plots on his life,  especially by poisoning of his foodo30      In JunOp 1941, these mental symptoms became moredeveloped and as a result of this increasingly suspicious(paranoid) and confused state of mind he made a cunninglyarranged attempt at suicide by throwing himself down c baiys^mj^lfU.This resulted in a fracture of his left thigh which was 1*successfully treated with a perfect result*

This unsoundness of mind might very well be hiddenif he had to take the lead in a ?party5 onc-&quot;* more, but his personal rclationships and his judgment would? however,be disturbed by it0    The fluctuations in the severity of his symptoms will recur and there is a perpetual riskof another? suicidal attempt without much warningo   For that&apos;reason ho raus? bu under constant psychiatric and nursingsupervision.-Were he an ordinary civilian patient it wouldhave   cor di .&apos;&apos;fj rube tc justify certification;    save justafter hit attemot at suicide^    lie could moreover bo livingat home and doing his ,/orlc although his difficult personalityand eccentricities would probably lead to trouble0From the angle of 5 responsibility^  it is in myopinion doubtful whether at any time he has been prevented by his me:&apos;:,tal difficulties from knowing the nature and quality of his actso&quot;
