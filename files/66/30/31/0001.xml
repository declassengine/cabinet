THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1942. 1 82SECRET Copy No.   30W.P. (42) 501.November 2, 1942.WAR CABINET.Mr. WENDELL WILLKIE&apos;S BROADCAST,Memorandum by the Minister of Information.AT the request of the Prime Minister I circulate below for the informationof the War Cabinet the more important passages from the broadcast made byMr. Wendell Willkie on the 26th October, 1942.B. B.November 2, 1942.Mr. Willkie, after describing his journey, said that he found that &quot;peoplelike our works not only because they help to make life easier and richer, butalso because we have found that American business enterprise, unlike that of most industrial nations, does not necessarily lead to political control orimperialism.&quot;&apos;&apos; I found this dread of imperialism everywhere. The fact that we are notassociated with it in men&apos;s minds has caused people to go much farther in their approval of us than I had dared to imagine. I was amazed to discover how keenlythe world is aware of the fact that we do not seek anywhere in any region toimpose our rule on others or exact special privileges.All the people of the earth know we have no sinister designs on them, that,even when we have in the past withdrawn from international affairs into a falseself-sufficiency it was without sinister purpose. They know that, now we are inthis war, we are not fighting for profit, or loot, or territory, or mandatory powerover the lives or Governments of other people. That, I think, is the single andmost important reason for the existence of our reservoir of goodwill throughoutthe world.Now, as I see it, the existence of this reservoir is the biggest political fact of our time. No other Western nation has such a reservoir. Ours must be usedto unify the peoples of the earth in the human quest for freedom and justice. . . .I bring you assurance that this reservoir exists. I also bring you warning that it is leaking. It is leaking dangerously. It is leaking at a thousand points.It is leaking through steadily spreading cracks and holes. These holes have notbeen punched in the reservoir by Hitler.   They have been punched by us. . . .For I tell you that if we continue to fail to deliver to our Allies what theyare entitled to expect from us, or what we have promised them, our reservoir of goodwill will turn into one of resentment. We cannot laugh this off, or shrug-it away, or hide it by censorship. Five million Russians and five million Chinesehave given their lives in this struggle. Each of these countries have lost as many men as we have in our entire army. We owe them more than boasts and brokenpromises.[24566]
We are also punching holes in our reservoir of goodwill every day by failing to define clearly our war aims. Besides giving our Allies in Asia and in eastern europe something to fight with we have got to give them the assurance of what we are fighting for. Two hundred million people of Russia and four hundredand fifty million of China people like you and me are bewildered and anxious.They know what they are fighting for. They are not so sure of us. Many ofthem have read the Atlantic Charter. Rightly or wrongly, they are not satisfied.They ask : What about a Pacific Charter; what about a World Charter?Their doubts were expressed to me in simple and unmistakable questions.Is there to be a Charter only for millions of the Western Hemisphere? they asked.Is there to be no Charter of freedom for the billion people of the East? Isfreedom supposed to be priceless for the white man of the Western world, but ofno account to us of the East? Many of them asked me the question which hasbecome almost the symbol all through Asia : What about India? Now, I did not go to India.I do not propose to discuss that tangled question to-night. But it hasone aspect, in the East, which I should report to you. From Cairo on, it con-fronted me at every turn. The wisest man in China said to me: &quot; When theaspiration of India for freedom was put aside to some future date it was notGreat Britain who suffered the loss of public esteem in the Far East; it was theUnited States.&quot;This wise man was not quaiTelling with British imperialism in India whenhe said this benevolent imperialism, if you like. He does not happen to believe it. but he is not even talking about it.   He is telling me. and through me you. that&apos; .... o o 0.1/-for our silence in India we have already drawn heavily on our reservoir of good-will in the East. The people of the East who would like to court us are doubtful.They cannot ascertain from our Governments wishy-washy attitude towards theproblem of India what we are likely to feel at the end of the war about all theother hundreds of millions of Eastern peoples. They cannot tell from our vagueand vacillating talk whether or not we really do stand for freedom, or what wemean hy freedom.In Africa, in the Middle East, and throughout the Arab world, as well as inChina, and in the Far East, freedom means orderly but scheduled abolition of thecolonial system. I can assure you that this is true. I can assure you that the rule of the people by other peoples is not freedom and not what we must fight to preserve.Please understand-1 am not talking about the Commonwealth of FreeNations. I am talking about the colonial system wherever it exists, under what-ever nation. We Americans are still too apt to think and speak of the BritishEmpire. We must recognise the truth that in the vast areas of the world there isno longer any British Empire, but, instead, a proud Commonwealth of FreeNations. British colonial possessions are but remnants of the Empire. We must remember that throughout the commonwealth there are men and women numberedby millions who are working selfiessly and with great skill towards reducing theseremnants, extending the Commonwealth in the place of the colonial system. This,it seemed to me, was what General Smuts was talking about in his recent dramaticspeech before the cheering British Parliament.As Americans we must also recognise that we share with these men andwomen of the British Commonwealth of Free Nations the responsibility of makingthe whole world a Commonwealth of Free Nations. The grim, relentless progressof this war is teaching all of us that in a world forced to choose between victoryand slavery, between freedom and fascism, there are no purely local problems.India is our problem. If Japan should conquer that vast sub-continent we will be the losers. In the same sense the Philippines are a British problem. Ifwe fail to deliver by force of arms the independence we have promised to theFilipinos the whole Pacific world will be the loser. We must believe these simpletruths and speak them loudly and without fear.Only in this way can the people of the world forge this strength and confidence towards each other which we will need to win the peace. . . .There are other holes that we are blindly punching in our reservoir of goodwill which can be more easily repaired. One of them is the half-ignorant,half-patronizing way in which we have grown accustomed to treating manypeoples in Eastern Europe and Asia.The rulers of our allies and our potential allies are proud and intelligentmen. The Shah of Iran, the Prime Minister of Iraq, the Prime Minister or foreign Minister of Turkey, the Generalissimo of China to mention just afew are men who understand the world and who have important ideas about
the future. They are in substantial agreement, for example, as to the necessityof abolishing Imperialism, of liberating the peoples of the world, of makingfreedom a reality instead of just a nice word. They feel unanimously, I think,that the United States can and must make an enormous contribution to the newsolutions. They are able and eager to work with the representatives of theUnited States and to begin now. . . .But consider our policy. We have consistently failed to send to these menrepresentatives with authority to discuss such problems intelligently and to takerealistic steps towards their solution.One of our representatives to a great Power, for example, although he has worked for more than twenty years in the country where he is stationed, hasnot troubled to learn the language of the proud and sensitive people to which heis accredited. On our special mission to Russia, no one of Cabinet rank hasbeen sent from this country to talk to Mr. Stalin. It was the British PrimeMinister who primarily spoke for us on the last such mission. Between Cairo andTeheran live Arab-speaking peoples of half a dozen lands with great traditionsand great futures. Yet when I was there, we had in all this area nominister or ambassador in residence.We must wipe out distinction from our minds between  &quot;first-class&quot; and&quot; second-class &quot; allies. We must send to represent us among ail our allies, reallydistinguished men who are important enough in their own rights to dare to tellour President the truth.Mr. Willkie went on to say that another leak in the reservoir of goodwillwas caused by the &quot; atrophy of the intelligence which has been produced bystupid, arbitrary or undemocratic censorship.&quot;&quot; It has been suggested much of late, for example, that private citizens,particularly those not expert in military affairs, or those Jiot connected withthe Government, should refrain from makins; suggestions with reference to theconduct of the war military, industrial, economic or political. It is said thatwe must remain silent and allow our leaders and experts to solve these problemsunmolested.This position threatens, I believe, to become a tight wall which will keeptruth out and lock misrepresentation and false security within. I have reportedto you to-night that in many important respects we are not doing a good job;that we are on the road to winning the war but that we run a heavy risk of spending far more in men and materials than we need spend. This report isbased on facts. Such facts should not be censored. They should be given tous all. For unless we recognise and correct them we may lose the friendshipof half of our allies before the war is over, and then lose the peace. . . .The record of this war to date is not such as to inspire in us any sublimefaith in the infallibility of our military and naval experts. Let us have no more of this nonsense. Military experts, as well as our leaders, must be constantlyexposed to Democracy&apos;s greatest driving power the whiplash of public opiniondeveloped from honest and free discussion. Men with great, power usually liketo live free from criticism. It is said when they get that way that is the timeto increase criticism.For instance, it was public criticism of the constant failures in North Africathat brought about the change of command there. When I was in Egypt that new command stopped Rommel. It has now begun aggressive fighting. I hopeour aid in this action will be adequate and prompt so that Britain and Americawill be able to eliminate Rommel and free North Africa from Axis dominationand begin the assault of the soft spots of Southern Europe. I reiterate : we and our Allies must establish a second fighting front in Europe. I also hopethat shortly we can put a considerable force in India for aggressive use in anall-out attack on Burma as General Wavell has urged. Thus we will relieve the pressure of our enemies on China and Russia, our superb fighting Allies. . . .To win that peace three things seem to me necessary first, we must plannow for peace on a world basis; second, the world must be free economically and politically for nations and for men that peace may exist in it; third, Americamust play an active constructive part in freeing it and keeping its peace. . . .When I say that in order to have peace, this world must be free, I am onlyreporting that a great process has started which no man certainly not Hitler can stop. Men and women all over the world are on the march physically,intellectually and spiritually. After centuries of ignorant and dull compliance,hundreds of millions of people in Eastern Europe and Asia have open books.Old fears no longer frighten them. They are no longer willing to be Easternslaves for Western profits.   They are beginning to know that men&apos;s welfare
throughout the world is interdependent. They are resolved, as we must he, thatthere is no more place for Imperialism within their own society than in a society of nations. The big house on the hill surrounded by mud huts has lost itsawesome charm.Our Western world and our presumed supremacy are now on trial. Ourboasting and our big talk leave Asia cold. Men and women in Russia and china and the Middle East are conscious now of their own potential strength.They are coming to know that many decisions on the future of the world lie intheir hands. They intend that these decisions shall leave the peoples of each nation free from foreign domination, free for economic, social and spiritualgrowth.Finally, when I say that this world demands the full participation of a self-confident America I am only passing on an invitation which these peoples of the East have given us. They would like the United States to be one oftheir partners in this grand adventure. They want us to join them in creating a new society, global in scope, free alike from the economic injustices of theWest and the political malpractices of the East. But, as partner in that greatnew combination, they want us to be neither hesitant, incompetent, nor afraid.They want a partner who will not hesitate to speak out for the correction ofinjustice anywhere in the world.&quot;
