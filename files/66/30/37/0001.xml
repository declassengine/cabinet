THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1942.secret copy No;9 C\W.P. (42) 507 (Revise).November 14, 1942.WAR CABINET.OUTLINE OF STATEMENT ON RECONSTRUCTION PROBLEMS.ON the 29th September, 1942, I undertook to make a statement in the nearfuture on reconstruction. In any statement I make I shall, of course, describe the method and machinery of our approach to reconstruction problems, but thestatement may perhaps serve as a convenient opportunity to correct some currentmisapprehensions and to give the public a better idea of what is aimed at and what has been done. The purpose of this note is to sketch broadly the line whichI should propose to take in making this statement.Here are some of the reasons why it is very important to put this across : (a) It excites the impatience of those who think that we should be concen-trating all our efforts on winning the war.(b) It arouses suspicion in the minds of all who remember the &quot; Homes forHeroes&quot; slogan in the last war, and the disenchantment which followed.(c) It is also clear that, if there is to be speedy rehabilitation of industryand the restoration of wealth and resources, these will involveconstructive effort and hard work. But, while the early prospect isarduous, the distant vistas offer great opportunities.(d) The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to say a word of warningon the subject of finance, viz. : &quot; Finance need not be our master, butwe must make sure we use it properly as a servant. It is obviousthat all our plans must be subject to the limitations of our availablefinancial resources. We have a great task before us and weare working hard to think out how best to perform it. Butwe cannot do everything at once. We cannot step straight fromthe rigours of war into a world of abundance. We must take firstthings first and try to find by good management an order of prioritieswhich reflects the priorities of the national need. If we do thisproperly we may reasonably hope that the resources for the executionof our plans will become available at a steadily increasing rate.&quot;Memorandumm by the Paymaster-General.I.Reconstruction is not the framing of Utopias.[246231B
The vital and immediate task of Reconstruction consists of those skeleton plans which must be prepared during the war to meet the complicated situa-tions which will arise immediately at the end of the war. These planscannot be extemporised.The essential point here is that it is the stern necessities of practical administra-tion which call for the preparation of these plans.The outstanding difficulty for which the plans must be prepared is thechange-over from war to peace.  This involves many problems : (a) Demobilisation. It is obvious that, while mobilisation has of necessitybeen intense, plans for demobilisation must be prepared at the sametime to provide for orderly discharge from the Forces. The principle on which the plans have been drawn up is that discharge will, inthe main, be based on age and length of service. Nor have weforgotten that many in the services will have missed the opportunityof education and training to fit themselves for careers. This applieswith special force to the disabled. The measures necessary to dealwith these problems have been under detailed review.(b) Setting our people to work on peace-time jobs without delay so as tomaintain, if we can, our standard of living. This involves questionsof orderly termination of war contracts; liquidation of stocks;decisions as to the future of Government factories, and activepreparation of plans by industry in collaboration with the Governmentfor peace-time production.(c) Getting&quot; a sufficiency of food and raw materials into this country andseeing that food is available for all at reasonable prices. If we are tobe able to pay for such supplies all possible steps will have to be takento rehabilitate our export trade. This will involve not only energeticaction by our own producers, but international co-operation as well,and such co-operation will also be required to secure an equitable distribution of world supplies with due regard, inter alia, to the needsof the liberated territories (cf. paragraph (f) below).(d) Continuance or relaxation of various measures of control. In order to direct the whole national resources to the war effort, very far-reachingmeasures of control have been adopted, covering every form ofindustry, man-power and raw materials. As has already been said on several occasions by Ministers, it is quite out of the question that all these measures could, be immediately relaxed. For one thing, it is very possible that war will come to an end at different times in various parts of the world so that we might haveto maintain the economy of this country on a war footing even afterthe collapse of one or more of our enemies. A far greater proportionof our national resources has, moreover, had to be mobilised duringthis war than in the last, and for this reason alone it is obviousthat any corresponding demobilisation process must be more gradualthan last time. For a considerable period shortages and the dangerof inflation will persist. Clearly no hard and fast rule can be laiddown and each measure of economic control and the question of itscontinuation will have to be looked at in the light of circumstances as they exist after the war. Otherwise the difficulties of the transitionwill be multiplied and essential raw materials and resources will notbe directed, as they should be, to turning our economy over speedilyfrom war to peace.(e) The provision of houses. This involves questions of temporary housing,the rebuilding of devastated areas as well as the overtaking of arrears of building and the improvement of housing conditions, especiallymaking good the shortage of cottages for agricultural workers. Itraises the whole question of the development of land. Unless this hasbeen thought out and practical schemes devised during the war and,indeed, unless arrangements for the acquisition of sites: for housing and the preparation of building plans are far advanced before the
war ends, either there will be long and unnecessary delays beforebuilding work is started, or the work will be done in an unorganisedway. In addition, the desirability of embarking on a limitedprogramme of building before the end of the war to provide bothnew houses and the necessary training for a great programme afterthe war cannot be overlooked, though it must not be allowed toimpede our war effort.(f) There must also be plans for the organisation of systematic relief to the liberated territories which have already been plundered and strippedbare by the enemy. I shall refer to this subject on lines suggested to me by the President of the Board of Trade.III.While the immediate tasks of reconstruction are forced upon us as matters ofcommon prudence and foresight, this does not mean that we need to limit, or have limited, ourselves to such tasks.The years immediately following the war will set the course for the nextquarter- or half-century. Tn them we shall be called upon to settle many issues of first importance. Is it not reasonable that we should hope that in this vitaltask there will emerge a considerable measure of agreement between all men ofgood will as to certain broad objectives which transcend the lines dividingpolitical Parties1? At any rate, it would seem reasonable to work on the basis that this will be found to be the case. Here are some major problems which one might hope would be tackled on this basis : (a) Post-War International Security. The structure of post-war securityis, of course, primarily a matter for the Foreign Secretary, but myorganisation is at his disposal for elaborating the details of any plan.Certain general objectives have already been laid down in the atlantic charter and in the United Nations Declaration. The development ofthe United Nations idea holds out the greatest hope for a system ofthe future. General Smuts has already given us his view that an approach to such problems as these must this time be morepragmatical and less theoretical, and he has also suggested thatwe should take the United Nations as the basis for any scheme and build up on them. Surely we should be wise to develop this suggestion.(This paragraph is on lines suggested by the Foreign Office, and isfor use at my discretion if it appears appropriate at the time.)(b) Economic   Expansion   and   Stabilisation   of   Employment. Afterexperiencing the benefits of brisk employment in two great wars,the people of this country will not willingly revert to the view thata large volume of unemployment is inevitable. We have learned much on this matter in the last twenty years and it should not be beyond our powers, by a combination of methods, to achieve far greater success in the future than in the past. To create conditions making 2jt fulland stable employment is a task of great difficulty and much depends on the international settlement. In accordance with article 7 of the mutual Aid Agreement we shall enter into conversations with theUnited States with a view to creating the conditions for world-wideeconomic expansion. It would be premature to attempt to say moreabout this at the moment. Certain underlying factors in the situationare being studied.I shall also refer to the International Labour Office in terms suggested by the Minister of Labour and National Service.(c) Social Security. Here, again, we may hope to find general agreement that we may continue the process of eliminating the grosser forms ofpoverty by an extension and consolidation of our great system of social services, in which so much pioneer work has been carried out in thepast by Parties of all political complexions.(d) Health. I shall refer to the fact that the Government have under activereview all the health and hospital services of the country-cf. inparticular the Minister of Health&apos;s statement on hospital policy onthe 9th October, 1941 (Hansard, Col. 1196).[24623] . B 2
(e) Food and Nutritional Standards. The Minister of Food has suggested the following : &quot; The distribution of food has been so organised as tosecure the proper feeding of all classes to a degree never beforeachieved. Means have been devised for getting the food to thepeople, in the best condition ancl the right proportions, with aminimum of waste, and with little regard for the accident of the size of the individual consumers income. We have acquired whatis, perhaps, more important than any piece of administrativemechanism a new sense of corporate responsibility for satisfying the basic needs of even the humblest individual citizen. Workscanteens and British Restaurants in ever-increasing numbers arebeing installed to&apos; provide for working people an opportunity of having a good hot meal during working hours. Never before has somuch attention been given to the food requirements of mothers and young children as in these war years.&apos;&apos;:; Many thoughtful citizens are asking : &apos; Is it only in a periodof war that special priorities are to be provided for workers, formothers, for young children and infants? Is it conceivable that what has been done to keep our people in good health and heart in a periodof food shortage shall cease to be done when supplies become abundantonce again?&apos; I, for one, cannot believe that the wise developments which have taken place in national nutrition during the last threeyears must be abandoned when the war is over.&quot;(f) Planning the future development of town and countryside. This hasalready been mentioned as one of the immediate tasks, but it is alsoa long-term problem.[The Reports of the Scott and Uthwati Committees, made to theMinister of Works and Planning, invoice the following main questions: (i) The machinery of the Centred Planning Authority.(ii) The acquisition by the State of the development rights in allundeveloped land outside built-up areas.(Hi) Conferment on local authorities of wider and simpler powersof compulsory acquisition of land,(iv) Periodic levy on tirban site value.Recommendation (iv) is not urgent and could not become effectiveuntil five years after the valuation had been made. It is probablycontroversial, and therefore could be left over for the time being. TheOfficial Internal Economic Committee have prepared a report to theReconstruction Problems Committee on (i). The Minister of works and Planning and I both hope that zve shall soon be able to announcesimultaneously a decision on this matter. As regards (ii), there are indications that this is likely to prove highly contentious. TheGovernment are already committed to (Hi), bxit a further announce-ment on this should be made. Lord Portal and I find that localauthorities are concerned not so much ivith the poxvers as with theassistance they xoill get from the Exchequer to enable them to exercise their powers. I hope to be authorised to make some statement ingeneral terms regarding this.^(g) .Planning the proper use of our natural resources. This involvesquestions of agriculture and of forestry.We are committed to a policy to secure a healthy and well-balanced agriculture. The Minister of Agriculture authorises meto say that detailed plans are well advanced and that his Departmenthope to be in a position to start discussions with the industry earlyin the new year. I am in touch with the Secretary of State forScotland also on the subject.As regards afforestation, in view of the depletion of our home-grown timber, the clanger of a general shortage of timber, and thefact which has now been demonstrated that timber can be grownin this country at least as efficiently as in any other country, we propose to adopt an extensive policy of planting after the war. Wemust make sure of a continuity of national policy, which in its turninvolves continuity of finance. The importance of research is also recognised. (The Reconstruction Problems Committee have expressed agreement with a statement on these lines, and have asked me tocontinue the detailed examination of this question.)
(h) The organisation and development of our utility services, such aselectricity, transport, water.I can say that we are looking into these matters with a view to seeing whether a large measure of agreement can be obtained as to future policy.(i) Education. There is a world of detail to tackle here, but on the broadaim of securing a system which gives equal opportunities to all thereis no important difference of opinion to-day.On all these matters, concerning as they do the work of other Departments.I should ask the Ministers in charge of those Departments to agree with me in greater detail the lines of my statement, where this has not already been done.(Initialled) W.
