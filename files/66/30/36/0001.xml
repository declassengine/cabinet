(42) 506.November 4, 1942.WAR CABINET.APPLICATION OE THE ATLANTIC CHARTER TO INDIA.Extract from the Prime Minister&apos;s Statement of September 9, 1941.Note by the Secretary.THE annexed extract from the Prime Minister&apos;s Statement in the Houseof Commons on the 9th September, 1941,* is circulated by direction of thePrime Minister.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES.Offices of the War Cabinet,Great George Street, S.W. 1.&quot;..................,   ,   .   It is a wise rule thatwhen two parties have agreed a statement one of them shall not, thereafter,without consultation with the other, seek to put special or strained interpretationsupon this or that passage. I propose, therefore, to speak to-day only in .an exclusive sense.First, the Joint Declaration does not try to explain how the broad principlesproclaimed by it are to be applied to each and every case, which will have to bedealt with when the wrar comes to an end. It would not be wise for us, at this moment, to be drawn into laborious discussions on how it is to fit all the manifoldproblems with which we shall be faced after the war. Secondly, the joint declaration does not qualify in any way the various statements of policy whichhave been made from time to time about the development of constitutional government in India, Burma or other parts of the British Empire. We arepledged by the Declaration of August 1940 to help India to obtain free and equalpartnership in the British Commonwealth with ourselves, subject, of course, tothe fulfilment of obligations arising from our long connection with India apdour responsibilities to its many creeds, races and interests. Burma also is covered by our considered policy of establishing Burmese self-government and bythe measures already in progress. At the Atlantic meeting, we had in mind,primarily, the restoration of the sovereignty, self-government and national life of the States and nations of Europe now under the Nazi yoke, and the principles governing any alterations in the territorial boundaries which may have to bemade. So that is quite a separate problem from the progressive evolution of self-governing institutions in the regions and peoples which owe allegiance to theBritish Crown. We have made declarations on these matters which are complete in themselves, free from ambiguity and related to the conditions and circum-stances of the territories and peoples affected. They will be found to be entirely in harmony with the high conception of freedom and justice which inspiredthe Joint Declaration.....................&quot;* Hansard, Cols. 68-69.26[24583]
