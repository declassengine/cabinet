United States technicians (and in this United States technicians are not greatlydifferent from those of other nations) the principal difficulty which had to be faced was the inadequacy of Lend-Lease funds to meet the overall british requirements, but this situation was largely met by a system of careful budgetingand by the prospect of the provision of further Lend-Lease money at a later date. To sum up, relations between the British and the Americans during the Lend-Lease period started well and grew increasingly co-operative.The Period since the U.S.A. entered the War.With the entry of the United States into the war on the 7th December,1941, the situation underwent a radical change. In the first flush of enthusiasmthe Americans readily accepted the system of combined organisations to controland implement the war policy of the United Nations, which was evolved duringthe visit of the Prime Minister to Washington at Christmas, 1941. Thatenthusiasm has to a very large extent continued in the Executive Staffs of the combined Boards themselves, but a reaction has been increasingly felt in theService Departments. These Departments are exceedingly powerful bodies. Noone below the President has so far succeeded in standing up to them, eventhough the powers have been provided for certain individuals to do so, andthe President himself only rarely dictates policy to the Service Departments.The attitude of die Service Departments is, therefore, the crux of the problem and it is proposed, in the following paragraphs, to analyse the situationprevailing in the War Department.Soon after the entry of the United States into the war the United StatesWar Department made clear its fixed determination, which had been maturingover the previous eighteen months, to build up an army of a size commensurate with that of the Germans. The Department apparently was prepared toco-operate with the &quot; combined&quot; idea and to cater for the needs of DefenceAid only to the extent that it did not interfere with the implementation of itsplans for a big army expansion. It regarded the measures taken previouslyto provide Defence Aid as a useful step towards the equipment of its own forces in that material, which was being procured for the Defence Aid countries,could be diverted in that direction. The idea of a big American army is apparently a purely American conception. In that only a small proportion ofit can be sent overseas for a very long time to come it does not have thesupport of the Combined Chiefs of Staff and, in fact, is contrary to the conception of the strategy of the war as already^ evolved by that body. The staff of theWar Department or, at any rate, the important part of it pays only lip service to the Combined Chiefs of Staff and in many cases it does not even do that.It is therefore interesting to analyse the reason underlying the insistenceof the War Department on a big United States army. In the following para-graphs are outlined some of the various component parts which go to make upthe War Departments view. These are not all universally held, or even widelyheld, and some of them are, perhaps, contradictory, but it is difficult to ignore the fact that they do exist and that they have in the aggregate considerable influence on the building up of the War Department&apos;s attitude. The component parts are:  (a) Mistrust of British military policy and practice and the conviction thatthe United States will have to step in and take complete control ofthe war. France, Greece, Crete, Libya, Hongkong, Singapore and burma are included in the list of British incompetences.(6) Jealousy of the British, arising out of many causes, some quite ill-founded. To salve her pride America must have the biggest andbest-equipped army.(c) Mistrust of London and its policy as to the conduct of the war whichthe Americans regard as being based on serving British interests.(d) American troops must not be defeated in action and they must, there-fore, not be committed to battle unless in sufficient numbers andadequately equipped to ensure every chance of victory. To secure this a high degree of over-insurance must be achieved, and theremust be no question of American troops being sent into battle without an abundance of supplies. The fact is ignored that, while thisabundance of supply for the United States Forces is being built up.
the armies of other countries already engaged have to hang on andsuffer heavy losses through inadequacy of their equipment and supplies.(e) The feeling that Russia is finished, that the Middle East, Iraq, Persia,etc., will be lost and that the United Kingdom may be overrun bythe Germans, leads to the conclusion that the United States may haveto accept a Hitler-dominated Europe and consequently an armedpeace.(/) In modification of (e); that it is too difficult to beat Hitler in Europe,and that it is easier to prosecute an &quot; island hopping&quot; war in the pacific which, incidentally, may secure high dividends in superficialsuccesses. This is largely the United States Navy&apos;s attitude, butit appears to be gaining increasing support in the War Department.It is also the feeling of others who are becoming bored with the warnow that the first excitement has worn off and there seems to be along dreary pull ahead of them.(g) The need for the United States to be militarily strong in order to dominatethe policy of the United Nations, both during the war and the making of the subsequent peace. This attitude takes various forms, ranging from the establishment of a &quot; Pax Americana &quot;, in substitution for the&quot;Pax Britannica&quot; (now regarded by many Americans as havingfinished its useful life), to a definite American Imperialistic policywhich aims at the building up of American power and prestige invarious parts of the world. It is difficult to ignore the fact that,under the guise of the war effort, this is already being attempted orachieved, at Britain&apos;s expense, in the Argentine, New Zealand, Persia,Australia, India, Egypt, Turkey, to mention only a few places.(h) A national inclination towards the German idea of a large army, caused by german successes in the field but disregarding the dissimilarity of thetwo cases.The foregoing is an estimate of the reasons underlying the United states attitude. The effect is to make the requirements of the United States Army in-increasingly dominate the activities of the International Supply Committee, the combined Munitions Assignment Board and the Munitions Assignment Committee(Ground). The United States Army must have what it wants and Defence Aidcan take the rest. The conception of the Combined Chiefs of Staff as to assign-ment on an operational basis is at variance with this and is largely ignored. Theneeds of the United States Army are regarded as sacrosanct by the United states representatives. While most of the members of these Committees would like tobe co-operative they cannot escape from being dominated by their superiorswhose aim is to implement the great American army policy. The situation is complicated by the fact that the staff of the United States Army has very littleexperience of large scale warfare and their requirements, often drawn up onnebulous theories, or on no proper basis at all, are drafted on most extravagantlines. In addition, the shortage of raw material and, in many cases, industrial capacity, are making it impossible for the War Department to achieve its owntarget figure of requirements and it is having to cut its coat according to its cloth.This process makes it even more difficult for the Defence Aid to get a hearing.The result of all this is to put negotiations for Defence Aid procurement andassignment on a business rather than on a combined operational footing. Insteadof regarding each case in the light of the needs and strategical plans of the united nations it becomes very largely a straight fight between the United States Armyand the British, the former usually holding most of the cards. Whereas in the days of straight Lend-Lease the British encountered the generous side of theAmerican character they now come up against the equally well-known businessside with all its ruthlessness and determination to achieve its object at any cost.It must be remembered that American commercial morality is not high, and that whatever they have pledged themselves to do in the past will not prevent themacting in a contrary manner in the future, especially if they think it will help towin the war or, simply, will help America. The problem thus reduces itself toone of the fundamental differences between the American and British character.This difference was on one occasion summarized by the late Arthur Purvis in the
following terms &quot; The difference between the American and the Englishman is thatthe American must win and will go to any length to do so, while the Englishman will do his utmost to win but would rather not win than do anything outside his acceptedcode of rules.&quot; It is obvious that under such circumstances the American must always be at a considerable advantage, even if it is only a temporary one, andespecially as he is the giver in all these cases. Possession is more than nine partsof the law.The foregoing paragraphs are an attempt to analyse, in very general terms,the situation confronting the British representatives on the International supply committee, and the Munitions Assignment Committee (Ground). The question of how the situation is to be improved claims the continuous and intensive attentionof those representatives and no effort is spared in order to evolve a satisfactory solution. In spite of these efforts, however, there is no disguising the fact thatthe situation continues steadily to deteriorate.Unless there is a change of attitude on the part of the Americans thesituation, from the point of view of obtaining supplies, is unlikely to improveunless and until there is an abundance of production, sufficient to cover bothUnited States Army requirements and the needs of Defence Aid. With the curtailment of production on account of raw materials and the limitation of facilities this situation is not in sight.(b42/127)   65   11/42   W.O.P.   12090
