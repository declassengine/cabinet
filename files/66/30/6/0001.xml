Photographic reconnaissance has been much hampered bythe bad weather.In September 1,114 mines were successfullv laid only 46 short of the Junerecord of 1,160.Operations.Bombing.Night-lubeck    (Submarine   BuildingYards)Flensburg (Submarine Yards)...Wismar (Town)Wismar,     Dornier     aircraft factory ......Krefeld......Aachen   ...      ...      ...      ...OsnabruckDay-Anti-Submarine Patrols      ....Anti-Submarine partols anti-Submarine PatrolsSluiskil (Chemical Works)   ...Ghent (Shell Oil Refinery)     ...Anti-Submarine partols anti-Submarine Patrols&apos; Liege (Steel Works)    ......Anti-Submarine PatrolsBremen   ...Saar Valley      .......Hengelo   (&quot;Engineering   works and Power Station)SaarbriickenAnti-Submarine partols anti-Submarine Patrols       :..Duisburg, Dusseldorf,  Gelsen-kirchenAnti-Submarine Patrols[24519]1/2 October1/2      ,,1/21/22/35/6 .6/727 September29301 October1199366688925 aircraft27      ,,5820191256237598011566511110657B
Operational Achievements.Liibeek and Flensbiirg Submarine Building Yards (lst/2nd October).Flensburg was attacked from very low altitude by 27 Halifaxes in the face of an intense light flak barrage; a high proportion of the crews are confident that they hit the target, but they were too low to take photographs at the time of bombing.   Daylight reconnaissance has not yet been possible.The attack on the Lubeck yard by25 Stirlings was frustrated by very lowcloud.Wismar (1st/2nd October).Wismar and the adjacent Dornier aircraft factory which had been attacked on 23rd/24th September were again raided on lst/2nd October, it is believedwith good results. Three aircraft attacked instead the Arado aircraft works and aerodrome at Warnemunde. A highly efficient smoke screen was operatingwhich covered not only the aerodrome and factory but also part of the sea-inletwhich is a good landmark for both Warnemunde and Rostock. Part of thesmoke screen is seen in Print No. 1.Krefeld (2nd/3rd October).190 aircraft attacked this large industrial city on the western outskirts of the Ruhr. The weather was fine but the night was dark and very hazy. TheGerman communique referred to damage and civilian casualties &quot; particularly at Krefeld,&quot; and some of the night photographs show fires in the town. No daycover has yet been secured.osnabruck (6th/7th October).This important railway centre and industrial town has already been severely damaged, and fifty-five acres of its business centre and docks devastated. On this occasion 237 aircraft attacked. The target was well illuminated by the Path-finders and all crews are confident that the attack was most successful.Photographs taken during the attack show large and rapidly growing fireswith clouds of smoke in the centre of the town and around the railway workshops,and indicate that a good concentration was achieved. The German high command communique admitted destruction and damage in osnabruck,particularly to residential and public buildings.Aachen (5th/6th October).Aachen, which is the centre of a large number of small but importantmanufacturing concerns, had been left in comparative peace since the10th/11th July, 1941, when 60 aircraft succeeded in burning out the middle ofthe town. On the 5th/6th October 257 aircraft were directed against it, butsevere electrical storms and icing conditions, together with cloud over the target,hindered navigation. A proportion of the force identified and attacked the town,and the crews reported fires which are confirmed by a night photograph taken atthe time.Daylight Raids.The 2 most successful daylight raids appear to have been that on theMunster marshalling yard and that on the Stork Engineering Works and power station at Hengelo in Holland.The Stork Works are engaged exclusively on the production of submarinediesel engines, and the two pilots who attacked them are quite certain that theyobtained hits; one claimed that his bombs exploded in the Power House, whichhe then saw engulfed in flames and smoke.Attacks on Submarines.No fewer than 5 attacks were made on submarines in the Bay of Biscay bythe O.T.U. Whitley aircraft of Bomber Command.On the 29th September a submarine was sighted on the surface and 4 depth-charges were dropped near it from a height of 50 feet before it had time tosubmerge completely.On the 30th September a submarine was attacked. An hour later itresurfaced, but the aircraft had expended all its depth-charges. The fact thatthe submarine took the risk of surfacing in the presence of aircraft suggests thatit had sustained damage.
On the 2nd October one aircraft straddled a submarine with depth charges.&quot;Another &quot; near missed &quot; one submarine with depth charges and then sightedanother on the surface, which it attacked with its machine guns, causing thesubmarined gunner to fall over the side while another member of the crew waswashed overboard as the vessel submerged.Information regarding Previous Raids.Munich.Photographs taken of Munich are on a small scale only and insufficient toallow of proper assessment.Items of damage so far revealed are as follows : The Baumann Engineering Works completely destroyed.The Kusterman ammunition works completely destroyed.Two gas-holders destroyed.The Opel depot for repairing cars and A.F.V.s severely damaged.Considerable damage to commercial and residential property, including a built-up area of 5  acres close to the centre of the city. One ofthe largest incidents of blast occurred within 75 yards of the BrownHouse.A tram depot partly destroyed.- It is reported that casualties were heavy, including 2,000 killed; thatparticularly severe damage occurred near the main station, and that the RosenbergTemple, which is the headquarters of the National Socialist Cultural Fraternity,was destroyed.It is also reported on good authority that the midnight express from Munichto Augsburg was wrecked and that some German officers travelling in the throughcoach from Rome were killed.The Munich press of the 22nd September announced that in order&apos;to placeall party. State, Municipal and Wehrmacht authorities at the disposal of the victims of the R.A.F. attack, Gauleiter Paul Gissler had ordered that the proposedparty day in Munich and all meetings should be cancelled.Duisburg.Duisburg is the largest inland port in the world, and three-quarters of thewhole of the Rhine cargoes are handled there. It will be recalled that the city and port was successfully attacked on 6th/7th September. The destructionrevealed by photography has already been reported.Reports from reliable ground sources, however, continue to accumulate. Theseconfirm that port traffic was completely stopped for some time after the attack,and indicate that no less than 90 barges were sunk. The effect of this stoppageat such a vital focal point in communications would hold up deliveries not onlythroughout the Ruhr, but also in the-whole area of the Rhine basin.It is also reported that 2,000 workers of the D.E.M.A.G. firm, which was engaged on producing gun barrels, machine guns, rifles and aircraft under -carriages, are still unemployed owing to the heavy damage to their works.The Saar.An interesting and important result of raids in the Saar Basin has just cometo light. Apparently the enormous concussion of our big bombs had disruptedmany of the ventilation shafts in the coal mines; repairs will take some timeand all work in the mines affected has been suspended.Wilhelmshaven.It is still not possible to assess the results of the successful raid onWilhelmshaven on 14th/15th September, but some parts of the city have been covered by day photographs taken in hazy conditions. These show a number ofnew areas of devastation and give promise that complete cover may reveal wide-spread success. This belief is supported by the plot of night photographs .taken during the attack, which shows excellent concentration over the target. A copyof this plot is attached.Dusseldorf.When   the  outstandingly  successful   attack  on  Dusseldorf   (10th/11thSeptember) was first reported a photograph was attached showing the ruins of[24519] B 2
the main station after being hit by a 8,000-lb. bomb. It is now known that anexpress train arrived at the same &quot;time as the bomb. 5ft passengers were killed,including some leading industrialists.It is also reported that the main telephone exchange was destroyed and thatcrops in the surrounding districts suffered heavily from fires started by strayincendiary bombs.Bremen.Since the big raid on Bremen on the 13th/14th September it has been impossible to obtain anything approaching complete photographic cover. A few of the suburban districts have been photographed, however, together with part ofthe Foeke-Wulf works at Neuenland.A considerable amount of industrial damage is revealed in these out-lyingareas although it is known that the main bombing concentration was on thecentre of the city. 5 factories have been severely damaged, including the LloydDynamo works and an A.F.V. factory, both of which are shown on print No. 2.At the Focke-Wulf works one third of a worker&apos;s hutted camp, which coversan area of 19 acres, has been demolished. This is shown on print No. 3. reports had previously been received that serious housing difficulties for the Focke-Wulffactory workers already existed before this attack.Danzig.It has now become known that during the attack on Danzig Harbour on the27th/28th August an alcohol distillery was burnt out and that a laden ship at thequayside was sunk.   Bombs also fell on a station and on some barracks.Kassel. &apos;It will be remembered that photographs taken after the last raid on Kasseishowed damage to one of the main buildings of the Henschell Sohn works. It isnow learned that this caused a production loss of 30 locomotives, a most satisfac-tory result in view of the known shortage of locomotives, the production of which now ranks in priority with aircraft and submarines.Effect of Raids on Goal and Steel Output.As a result of raids on the Ruhr, Saar and Aachen districts, coal productionin this area has dropped from 440.000 tons to 360,000 tons per day. Inparticular, the output from the Rhein-Preussen mines near Duisburg has fallenfrom 12,000 tons to 9,000 tons, due to damage sustained by miners&apos; homes in theneighbourhood. No less than 2,000 hoirses out of 5,000 are said to have been rendered uninhabitable.Damage to blast furnaces in the same areas has compelled the Germans to open up two partially idle steel works in France, to which they are having tosupply the necessary materials.German Reactions to Raids.   .An interesting example of the nervous tension under which the inhabitants* of towns in Western Germany are now labouring is the effect of the Karlsruheraid (the 2ncl/3rcl September) on the population of Freiburg. Freiburg has a.population of 110,000 and is 75 miles south of Karlsruhe. It is reported that. large numbers of Freiburgers spend their nights in the Black Forest fearingthey will be the next to be bombed. At home they are prohibited from takingbaths owing to fear of a water shortage in the event of air attack.Mining.The following successes have been confirmed : -. (i) On the 14th August, 1942, a German minesweeper was mined and sank in the Drogden Channel.(ii) In the middle of August two trawlers, one German and one Danish,were sunk to the south of Copenhagen.(iii) On the 21st August the German motor ship Ninrich (523 tons) was mined and sank off Faemo, in the Great Belt.(iv) On the 24th August the Finnish Steamer Else (1,360 tons) was mined.two miles S.E. of Vesberg Light, in the Great Belt.
(v) On the 24th August a German steamer, Peter von Dantsig (880 tons&quot;),was mined and sank N. of Fornaes, in the Kattegat.(vi) On the 6th September the Finnish Brittannic (2,242 tons) was minedin the Kattegat.(vii) On the 16th September the German steamer Scliamhoern (3,000 tons)was mined in the Kattegat,(viii) On the 17th September the German minesweeper Ann I (172 tons) was mined and sank off Svanegrunden in the Great Belt,(ix) On the 19th September the Danish patrol vessel K.1 was mined and sank off Espergaerde in the Sound,(x) On the 20th September the Danish Emile was mined&apos; and sank inAggersosund in the Great Belt.(xi) On the 21st September the Danish fishing vessel Pool was mined and sank in the Sound.(xii) On the 22nd September the Danish steamer Falken (369 tons) was mined and sank oft&quot; Espergaerde in the Sound.(xiii) On the 22nd September the Danish schooner Sara was mined and sankoff Espergaerde in the Sound.(xiv) On the 22nd September the German M/V Hilde (491 tons) was minedin the Great Belt.(xv) On the 22ncl September the German Heimat (231 tons) was mined and sank outside Copenhagen.(xvi) On the 23rd September the German steamer Hast was mined in the little Belt.(xvii) Recently, two of the smaller vessels carrying ore to Bayonne weremined and sank at the entrance to the port. It has been reportedthat from about the 26th September all ships carrying iron orebetween Bilbao and Bayonne were stopped due to the danger ofour mines.(xviii) The Finnish freighter Navigator, reported previously as having been damaged by mines on the 25th September, has now been beached.Gneisenau.A photograph of the Gneisenau in floating dock at Gydnia is attached(Print No. 4). It will be seen that her bows have been completely removed, andthat there is a black hole where her after-turret was. Repairs should take atleast another 4 months to complete.Plots of Night Photographs.Reference has been made in this Summary to &quot; plots &quot; of night photographsas an indication of the success.of an attack in the absence of evidence revealed bydaylight reconnaissance. It is thought that a description of these plots would beof interest, and two examples are attached (Prints 5 and 6).Every crew attempts to take a photograph as its bombs are released. In thepast, technical and personal failures were frequent, but the present technique,which is largely automatic, is producing a high proportion of successful photo-graphs. These are plotted on a diagram whose centre is the aiming point of the attack. The photographs do not necessarily show the bursts of the aircraffsbombs, but the evidence of day photographs has proved that damage almostinvariably occurs within the area photographed. Thus the plot is ,a very goodindication of the degree of concentration achieved in the target area and bears a close relation to the plot of actual damage revealed by day photographs. Thisrelationship is apparent if the attached night photograph plot of the Karlsruheraid is compared with the damage plot of Karlsruhe attached to the last Summary.Copies of the plots are issued to Squadrons. The aircraft of each Group are indicated by a special symbol and within each symbol is a number which refers tothe name of the captain of the aircraft. Thus they serve also to stimulateefficiency and competition between Operational Groups and between individualcrews.A. H. M. S.October 20, 1942.
