naval SITUATION.General Review.1. Allied naval and air operations in the Solomons have inflicted seriouscasualties on the enemy.Our light forces have sunk a heavily escorted ship in the Channel.E-boats have again attacked shipping off our East Coast.Shipping losses have been considerable. A convoy from Canada, and shipping in the South Atlantic, have been heavily attacked by U-boats.Home Waters.2. On the evening of the 13th a heavily escorted  enemy ship, steamingdown Channel, was sighted and reported by a naval aircraft oft&apos; the french coast, 30 miles south-east of Cape Barfleur. Early on the following morning a force of our destroyers and M.T.Bs. intercepted the enemy north ofCap de la Hague. The ship was set on fire, and was subsequently torpedoed and sunk by M.T.B. 236. Two of the escorting torpedo-boats were left sinking.Another force of our destroyers, to the east of Sark, damaged a torpedo-boat and sank a mine-sweeper. Our forces came under fire from shore batteriesbut suffered no serious damage.In the course of three attacks by E-boats on a coastal convoy off Cromer onthe night of the 13th/14th, H.M. Destroyer Westminster sank one E-boat and damaged two others.West Atlantic.3. On the 14th H.M. Canadian Armed Yacht Caribou was torpedoed bya U-boat in the Cabot Strait.Mediterranean.4. On the 14th H.M. Submarine Utmost torpedoed a large tanker off thenorth-east coast of Sardinia; it is possible that the ship was subsequentlybeached. On the same day H.M. Submarine P. 46 sank two ships in theTyrrhenian Sea.During the week 27,436 tons of French merchant shipping westbound and2,536 tons eastbound have passed Gibraltar under escort.Pacific.5. The U.S. 8&quot; Cruisers Quincy, Vincennes and Astoria were sunkwhile covering the landing of U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal Island on the night of the 8th August.6. Two Japanese light cruisers and four destroyers were attacked north ofNew Georgia on the 9th October. One cruiser was seriously damaged, one slightly damaged and three seaplanes were destroyed. On the same day a Japanese heavycruiser, four destroyers and a 5,000-ton transport were sunk by a U.S. naval force north of Guadalcanal.7. U.S. submarines operating in Far Eastern waters have sunk one heavycruiser, one small tanker and one trawler; damaged and probably sunk one cargo ship; and damaged one large and one small tanker.8. Aircraft are reported to have sunk one enemy destroyer and damagedtwo cruisers, one seaplane tender, one destroyer and two transports. Details aregiven in the Air Situation.Anti-Submarine Operations.9. Early on the morning of the 15th, H.M. Destroyer Viscount, escorting ahomeward-bound convoy, sank a U-boat in the N.W. Approaches.On the 8th H.M. Destroyer A dive made a promising attack off the Cape ofGood Hope.Exclusive of ships and aircraft operating from the U.S.A., reports havebeen received of twelve other attacks by surface craft, one by a submarine and seven by aircraft during the week. Of these, three were carried out in thevicinity of the Cape, two off Freetown, one east and one west of Gibraltar, four
in the Bay of Biscay or to the westward, and three south-west of Iceland (C).In North American waters, two attacks were made in the St. Lawrence River,one in the Bay of Fundy and three in the Caribbean.Enemy Intelligence.German.10.   There is no change in the disposition of the German Fleet.Italian.11. There has been a slight increase in the number of ships arriving in north Africa from Italy during the week.U-boats.12. Six or seven U-boats are now operating in the southern part of theSouth Atlantic, and a similar number are probably on their way to this area.There has been some activity to the westward of Freetown, and a number havebeen reported in the vicinity of the Cape Verde Islands. There has been a lulloff the U.S. seaboard and east of Trinidad, but U-boats have been active in theGulf of St. Lawrence. The majority are at present concentrating on the convoyroutes in the North Atlantic.Japanese U-boats have been operating off Ceylon.13. Reports have been received that the Germans are now operating severalmodified and new-type U-boats. These include a 1,600-ton class, 500-tonand 750-ton minelavers, 1,000/1,200-ton cruiser U-boats, and supply U-boats of between 1.200 and 1,600 tons.Protection of Seaborne Trade.. 14. During the week ending 11th/12th, 934 ships have been convoyed. Ofthese, 184 were in ocean convoys and 750 in British coastal convoys. Twoanti-aircraft ships, 48 destroyers (including one U.S. destroyer) and 83 sloops,cutters and corvettes (including four U.S. cutters) were employed on escort duties.During the week, 67 ships in three ocean convoys arrived in Home Waters.One ship was sunk.15. During September, 379 ships in 12 ocean convoys arrived in Home&quot;Waters without loss. Twelve ships, three of which were stragglers, were lost in four convoys originally comprising 131 ships.Thirteen outward-bound convoys consisting of 286 ships arrived at their destinations without loss. Three convoys, originally of 84 ships, lost 21, twoof which were separated from their convoy.16. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending 10th October totalled 813.000 tons, compared with 570,000 tons duringthe previous seven days and an average of 700,000 tons for the past ten weeks.Of the week5s imports, 225.000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.17. During the week 25 ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boats,of which 18 are known to have sunk.. These include three transports which were proceeding independently to the United Kingdom with service personnel fromthe Middle, East. On the 9th, the Oronsay (20,043 tons) was torpedoed south-westward of Freetown, and, on the 11th, the Duchess of A tholl (20,119 tons) andthe Orcades (23,456 tons) were torpedoed and abandoned north-east of Ascensionand south-west of Capetown respectively. One thousand survivors were picked up from the Orcades, leaving 27 unaccounted for; 821 were rescued from theDuchess of A tholl, and reports have been received of 16 lifeboats with survivorsfrom the Oronsay.Eight ships in &apos; a homeward-bound convoy were sunk north-east of new foundland. A straggler from another homeward-bound convoy and one ship in an outward-bound convoy were torpedoed in the N.W. Approaches. Six ships,five of which were sunk, were torpedoed in the neighbourhood of Capetown andtwo others were torpedoed south-west of Freetown. A ship was sunk in the st. Lawrence River and another torpedoed in the Cabot Strait. In the indian ocean one ship was torpedoed to the south-west and one to the east of Ceylon.[24494] B
Since the 7th October, 15 ships, totalling 108,070 tons, have been torpedoedin the Capetown area.E-boats torpedoed two ships of a coastal convoy off Cromer.A fishing trawler was sunk by mine off the South Devon coast.18. Shipping losses from enemy action during September, as recorded todate, total 493,000 tons, as compared with 648,073 tons in August and 598.533 tonsin &quot;July. Over 88 per cent, of the September losses were due to U-boats, theremainder being caused by aircraft. Except for about 30.000 tons in the indian ocean and 74,000 tons lost in a convoy to Russia, the bulk of the losses occurred to  the eastward of Trinidad, in the N.W. Approaches, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence,and in the area north and south of the Equator between Freetown and ascension island.Only nine tankers, totalling 85.000 tons, were sunk in September, ascompared with 19 in August. 13 in July. 26 in June. 31 in May and 33 in April.British Minelaying.19. Mines have been laid by light craft off the Flemish coast, and mine-laying by our aircraft, including naval aircraft, has taken place off the north sea and Channel coasts and in the Bay of Biscay.Enemy Minelaying.   British Minesweeping.20. A considerable number of mines have been detected off the East Coast,but there has been no definite evidence of enemy minelaying by either aircraft or surface craft during the week. Thirty-eight magnetic and two acousticmines were destroyed off the Humber.The mine totals to date are : Acoustic, 1,327; magnetic, 2,687; moored, 1,749.H.M. Destroyer Bleasdale was damaged by a mine south of Selsey on the 10th.Enemy Merchant Shipping.21. Six enemy ships have left ports in the Bay of Biscay bound for theFar East, where they intend to load cargoes of fats and rubber. Eight german ships, at least one of which has reached the South Atlantic. ai&apos;e to attempt to run the blockade from Japanese ports to German or German-controlled ports.22. According to a recent estimate, about 1,096,000 tons of shipping in theMediterranean were available to the enemy at the end of August. This totalincludes ships captured from the Allies, but. excludes tanker tonnage and alsoabout 54,000 tons of shipping in the Black Sea, which is entirely employed in trade between Roumania and occupied Russia.This estimated tonnage is used for military and commercial operations and provides for shipping under repair. It is calculated that about 65,000 tons of available merchant shipping would be permanently laid up for repairs owingto damage caused by marine risks. The loss and damage through Allied action would, it is estimated, permanently immobilise a further 200,000 tons if the rateof sinkings and construction remains constant. The total, therefore, of tonnage available to the enemy is thus reduced to 831,000 tons, and this must be fully employed in maintaining present supply routes. There are military supplies to be carried to Libya, the Piraeus, and the Dodecanese, industrial and commercialcargoes for transit between Turkey, Greece and Italy, and the Italian coast trade,which includes journeys to ports in Sardinia and Sicily.23. It is reported from Massawa that the German s.s. Frmienfels (7,487tons) was taken in prize on the 14th.vichy French Shipping.24. It has been reliably reported that 35 Allied ships, totalling 118.190tons, now interned in French ports, are about to be transferred to the axis power. Of this tonnage. Italy is to receive 22 ships of 56,778 tons and Germany13 ships of 61,412 tons. The ships are to be manned by Axis crews with a certainnumber of Vichy French volunteers, but no information has been receivedregarding the actual dates of sailing.
Russian Intelligence.25. It is estimated that Archangel will be free of ice and open to trafficuntil the 20th November.The Russian patrol vessel Muscolonn was sunk off the coast of Nova Zemblaon the 11th.  Aircraft and U-boat mining is suspected in this area.It is believed that four or five Russian submarines are operating in theBaltic.The total Russian submarine strength in the Black Sea is 43, which includessix refitting and one completing.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.Northern and Central Sectors.26. Local Russian successes gained in September in the Leningrad area and south of Lake Ilmen appear now to have been largely nullified by german counter-measures.The Russians appear to have had no recent success in the Rzhev area, thoughthe position is obscure. They have been making determined efforts to gain thetown, and street fighting doubtless continues.Stalingrad Sector.27. Russian attacks against the German northern flank between theRivers Don and Volga continue to hamper the Germans in their efforts to takeStalingrad.In the city itself street fighting has been on a reduced scale and Germanprogress has been negligible.Caucasus Sector.28. The Germans have been fanning out in the area between the RiversKuma and Terek, but have met with resistance some 50 miles north-west ofKizlyar.The Russians have given ground slightly south-south-east of Mozdok and afurther German advance has been made up the eastern bank of the upper Terekriver.The Germans have made only slow progress in their attack towards Tuapsefrom the north-east, being now some 20 miles from the port.Summary.29. The lateness of the season and the continued Russian resistance atStalingrad have now rendered an attack against Leningrad this year improbable.If Stalingrad falls, the Germans seem likely to content themselves with extendingtheir occupation of northern Caucasia and, possibly, attempting to reach the southCaucasus. Winter conditions, however, are at hand in the higher Caucasusmountains and passage to the south by land can now be attempted only via the narrow coastal route which runs through Makhach Kala along the shores of the caspian Sea.Egypt.30. Patrol activity during the week has continued, and apart from one raidon the night of the 5th/6th, when we succeeded in occupying temporarily anenemy strong point in the Ruweisat Ridge area, there is nothing of importanceto report. The 16 Pistoia (motorised) division and a group of Italian parachutebattalions known as the Folgore Division, at present acting as infantry, haverecently been identified in North Africa.Madagascar.31. Our land forces have continued their advance south of Antsirabe inthe direction of Ambositra. By the evening of the 13th stiff opposition by the vichy French in prepared positions 4 miles north of Ambositra had been over-come, and we captured 170 prisoners (including 50 Europeans). On the following morning our leading elements occupied the town.  The situation is quiet.[24494] B 2
Far East.South-West Pacific.32. Between the 25th September and the 8th October the Australian troopsin Portuguese Timor were reinforced, bringing the total to 610. There are also185 Dutch troops operating in this area.In New Guinea Australian patrols have had successful encounters with japanese patrols 10 miles south of Kokoda.South Pacific.33. The U.S. forces on Guadalcanal Island, in the Solomons Group, have extended their positions westward on the north shore. The Japanese have beenlanding small parties by night on the north-west tip of the island from destroyers.The successful naval action on the 9th, however, seriously interfered with these operations.Intelligence.German Forces.34. The estimated total of German divisions has now been raised to 298 bythe identification of two additional training divisions in Germany. Thedistribution of divisions remains otherwise unchanged.Japanese Forces.35. Japan. The number of divisions in Japan which was up till very recently believed to be 15 is now thought to be six.  Seven divisions are unlocated.36. Burma. There is evidence that some of the Japanese troops now taking part in the operations in the South-West Pacific were withdrawn from Burmaat the end of the Burma campaign, but this does not necessarily mean that thereis any reduction in the total Japanese strength in Burma, which may have been reinforced by other troops from Malaya. Siam, Indo-China or even Japan.37. China.- An increase of two Japanese divisions in north and centralChina is thought to be due to the increase in the number of confirmed identification-tions. It is most unlikely that there is any growth in the total numerical strengthof the Japanese forces in China. On the contrary, it is known that some of the divisions, particularly in Shansi, are below strength and all evidence goes toshow that the Japanese are withdrawing some of their more experienced andseasoned troops from China for use elsewhere.38. New Britain-Solomons-New Guinea area. One division commandedby Lieut.-General Horii Tomataro is known to be in this area; there are alsotwo other divisions, one of which probably came from the Philippines, and a brigade from a division located in Burma commanded by Major-GeneralKawaguchi Seiken. In addition there are a number of marine landing parties,making the total Japanese strength in this area equivalent to at least four divisions.AIR SITUATION.General Review.39. A strong force of U.S. day-bombers attacked targets at Lille. At night,a heavy and concentrated raid was carried out on Kiel.Large-scale enemy attacks were resumed against Malta; Spitfires inflictedheavy casualties on the raiders.Intensive operations were maintained against Japanese shipping and aerodromes in the Pacific Zone.United Kingdom.40. Fighter Command flew 1,108 sorties by day (including four by U.S.aircraft) and 274 by night.By day a slight increase in enemy offensive operations was evident; thisactivity was, however&apos;, almost entirely limited to attacks on south and south-eastcoastal objectives, by groups of two or four fighters at a time.The only night attack against this country was carried out on the Tynesideby eight bombers.
Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.41. Aircraft of Fighter and Army Co-operation Commands flew a total of797 offensive sorties, and Bomber Command flew 14; these compare with 310 and14 sorties respectively during the previous week. In addition, 115 US. Bombersorties and 79 U.S. Fighter sorties were flown; last week&apos;s totals being 73 and97 respectively.The principal operation was a high-level raid directed against the Fives-Lille Steel and Engineering Works and the Ateliers d&apos;Hellemmes, (Locomotive,Carriage and Wagon Works). About 150 tons of bombs were released during the attack, which was made in good weather. An assessment of damage appears inAppendix VII.The bomber force employed against these targets and in diversions overCayeux and St. Omer comprised 88 U.S. Fortresses and 27 U.S. Liberators. Theirgun-crews accounted for 48 enemy aircraft shot down and many others damaged.Twenty-nine Squadrons of R.A.F. Spitfires and one of Defiants, together with three Squadrons of U.S. Spitfires and three of U.S. Lightnings provided coverand support and made diversionary sweeps, during which they succeeded indestroying five enemy aircraft for the loss of one Spitfire. Three U.S. bombersdid not return and another crashed (crew safe).Sixteen Squadrons of Spitfires and one of Typhoons swept the Dunkirk-Le Treport area and damaged four intercepting enemy fighters. Three Spitfiresare missing.Mosquitos, three of which were lost, dropped bombs at Hanover, Sluiskil.Limburg, Koblenz, Sieburg and on other targets in Germany. Mustangs of army Co-operation Command made low-level attacks on railway and military objectives in occupied territory.The Photographic Reconnaissance Unit made 51 sorties and a further28 photographic sorties were flown by aircraft of Army Co-operation Command.Night.42. Bomber Command despatched 347 sorties against land targets comparedwith 812 last week. About 265 tons of H.E. bombs (including 90 x 4000-lbs.)and 410 tons of LBs. (including 9 x 4000-lbs.) were dropped during the week.The naval base at Kiel was attacked by 233 aircraft. A total of 540 tons of bombs was released in an effective and concentrated raid in good visibilityassisted by flares accurately placed by the Pathfinder force, which consisted of28 aircraft. Numerous large fires in the dock area and town were reported to bewell established before the last of our bombers&apos;left the target. Eight aircraft are missing.Wismar and the adjacent Dornier factory were the objectives for the only other raid during the period. A total of 44 aircraft, two of which are missing,dropped approximately 100 tons of bombs. The aiming point was difficult to locate owing to low cloud but one crew reported a large fire in, or close to. thefactory and other scattered fires were seen in the target area.Intruder operations over enemy aerodromes were carried out by 14 aircraftbut no claims were made.Coastal Operations.43. Coastal Command despatched 561 sorties, of which 263 were on anti-U-boat operations, 44 on mine-laying and 16 on convoy escorts. Bomber Commanddespatched 37 aircraft on patrols in the Bay of Biscay area. (Results of anti-U-boat operations are summarised under &quot; Naval Situation.&quot;) Fighter Commandflew 610 shipping-protection patrols and 58 offensive sorties against shipping,the latter including Naval Albacores. A total of 26 U.S. aircraft operatedagainst shipping.An escorted tanker north of Cape Finisterre was probably damaged after an attack by Whitleys. Spitfires damaged an R-boat off Dunkirk. Other attacks on enemy shipping resulted in near misses and some were carried &quot;out under conditions which precluded observation of results.Three of our aircraft failed&apos; to return from longe-range anti-U-boat patrols and two crashed (crews safe). Beaufighters destroyed two Ju. 88s and a flyingboat and damaged a third Ju. 88 and a F. W. 200.Two hundred and fifty-four aircraft of Bomber Command laid 555 sea-mines and 42 more were laid by naval aircraft operating under Coastal Command.Seven aircraft, including two naval aircraft, are missing from these operations and one crashed.
sMediterranean.Egypt and Libya.44. Allied aircraft flew 1,617 sorties compared with 1,078 in the previousweek.   Weather conditions were not generally favourable for air operations.Photographic reconnaissance revealed that many enemy aircraft weregrounded on the waterlogged forward landing grounds in the El Daba area.On the 9th, light bombers &quot;(including some U.S. Mitchells) and fighter bombers,with strong fighter escorts, attacked these landing grounds throughout the day.Ten enemy aircraft were destroyed and at least 18 others severely damaged onthe ground; in addition one tank, two dumps and a number of M.T. vehicles were destroyed. In combat ten enemy aircraft were shot down, five were probably destroyed and six damaged. Our losses were 15 fighters and one bomber; nine of these were part of a formation of Hurricanes which was carrying out a low-flying attack.The operation was continued at night by 47 Wellingtons, which, with the aid of flares dropped by naval Albacores, attacked Fuka landing ground.A number of fires were started, four aircraft on the ground were-seen to be destroyed and some dumps were blown up.A combined attack by Beauforts and Bisleys was made on a traincarrying explosives and big guns south of Sidi Barrani; the train was blownoff the line and completely wrecked. Another attack on a train near Capuzzoresulted in direct hits on four* trucks and some near misses. Beaufightersdestroyed twelve railway trucks, and attacked a schooner which was left emittingsmoke.Offensive sorties were flown by fighters over the forward areas but the numberof combats was limited. One formation of 12 Ju. 87s, escorted by 20 Me. 109s,was intercepted by British and TJ.S. fighters. Two Ju. 87s and 2 Me. 109s were shot down, two Ju. 87s were probably destroyed and five other enemy aircraft were damaged; one U.S. Warhawk is missing. Fighters also attacked enemymotor vehicles along the coastal roads and behind the battle area. Hits were obtained on two tanks and on a number of petrol tankers and M.T.U.S. bombers made two daylight attacks on Benghazi and two on Tobruk.At the latter a possible hit and many near misses were made on two large ships.Tobruk was also bombed by Wellingtons and Halifaxes on three nights; one small ship was hit and some very large fires were started in the dumps area.Small numbers of enemy fighter-bombers were active in the battle area againstA.A. positions, artillery, M.T. and troops. For two hours on the 10th enemy aircraft bombed defended localities held by their own troops. A single enemy aircraft attacked our landing ground at Kufra, destroying one aircraft and damaging two others.Malta.45. Since the beginning of the war fighters and A.A. guns at Malta have destroyed over 1,010 enemy aircraft.In the week ending the 12th October our aircraft flew 455 sorties comparedwith 282 in the previous week.On the 11th, long-range bombers operating from Sicily, probably reinforced by units transferred from Crete, resumed operations against Malta on a large scale. Enemy daylight sorties from the 11th to 14th inclusive were 186 bombers and 734 fighters; our Spitfires flew 475 sorties.Enemy attacks were carried out up to six times each day by formations ofapproximately eight to ten bombers escorted by 40 to 50 fighters. The objective was our aerodromes, but the raids were intercepted well north of the Island, andalthough some aircraft made landfall, the bombing was erratic and ineffective.Our Spitfires, although outnumbered were most successful in combating theenemy and breaking up his formations. In four days&apos; fighting 80 enemy aircraft were destroyed, 34 probably destroyed and 100 damaged; only 16 Spitfires are missing, but nine pilots were saved.At night attacks were carried out by a small number of bombers, four ofwhich were destroyed by Beaufighters.Sea Communications.46. On the 7t&apos;h U.S. Liberators obtained several direct hits on ships atSuda Bay.On the 9th a southbound convoy of two ships and four destroyers was attacked south-west of Crete and an explosion was observed on one ship.
gWellingtons again attacked the convoy north of Bomba and hit a destroyer.A ship was seen to sink, but no hit on it was claimed by the Wellingtons.Two out of three Beaufighters were shot down in an attack on a ship of2,000 tons and a destroyer oft&apos; Horns; the results of bombing were not observed,but the ship was raked with cannon and machine-gun fire.A naval Albacore torpedoed a southbound ship of 7,000 tons East of Horns.Russian Front.47. The Russians claim that in the week ending the 10th October theGermans lost 123 aircraft against 78 of their own.At Stalingrad German close support of ground attacks north-west of thecity practically ceased, and attacks on Russian supply routes were less frequent.There has been an increase in the German air activity in the Caucasus area.Considerable damage was reported to have been caused at the oil refinery town of Grozni. Bombing attacks have been made on the harbour and town of Tuapseand in support of the advanced ground troops.The Russians claim to have sunk transports, barges and motor-torpedo boats in German occupied ports in the Black Sea, and attacks were again made onNovorossisk.Considerable air activity is reported in the Lake Ilmen area.Madagascar.48. On the 7th, Vichy aircraft were bombed and machine-gunned on the landing ground at Ihosy; two were destroyed and two were damaged.India, Burma and Ceylon.49. Blenheims successfully bombed Pakkoku Aerodrome (60 miles N.W. ofMeiktila), railway sidings at Ywataung (10 miles S.W. of Mandalay), barracksat Kalewa and road traffic near Gangaw (50 miles S. of Kalewa). A Hudsonbombed a 2,000-ton armed ship 132 miles S.E. of Akyab, obtaining one hitamidships.Catalinas are maintaining anti-U-boat patrols on the shipping route offthe coast of Ceylon.One enemy aircraft reconnoitred Fenny (45 miles N.W. of Cox&apos;s Bazar)and two flew over the Calcutta area.Pacific Zone.50. Allied, aircraft maintained intensive operations against Japaneseshipping and aerodromes.In the Solomons area, carrier-based aircraft damaged a heavy enemy cruiser, a transport and seaplane-tender south of Bougainville Island. During the landing of Japanese troops at Guadalcanal Island (vide Military Situation,paragraph 33), U.S. dive-bombers sank a destroyer and damaged a 7,000-toncruiser and a destroyer. Four 4-engined flying-boats were destroyed at Faisiand two bombers were shot down in the Shortland Islands area. A 10,000-tontransport, 100 miles East of Jacquinot Bay (S.E. New Britain), with 12 fighter aircraft aboard, was left stationary and on fire after being hit twice by bombsfrom a Hudson.Rabaul was raided three times by a total of 77 heavy bombers; fuel dumps,jetties, runways and a military camp were hit and many fierce fires were leftburning. Allied aircraft also attacked the aerodromes at Lakunai andVunakanau; bombs fell among dispersed aircraft and on runways. Twenty-three bombers raided Lae Aerodrome, where an ammunition dump wasdemolished. The aerodromes at Buna (New Guinea) and Buka (Solomon Islands)were each subjected to two raids; large fires resulted.Military objectives along the Kokada/Wairopi track were also successfullybombed.On the 11th, 35 enemy bombers and 30 fighters attacked Guadalcanal; Alliedfighters shot down eight bombers and four fighters for the loss of two US. fighters.Japanese air reinforcements, consisting almost entirely of fighters whichwere ferried from Japan in converted aircraft-carriers, have arrived in theBismarck Archipelago-Solomons area, raising the strength from 175 to 260aircraft.   In New Guinea, where enemy air strength has been declining for some
time, the small remaining balance has now been withdrawn, presumably to theBismarck-Solomons area. Local Allied superiority, based on Port Moresby, andsteady wastage in the Solomons appear to have compelled this withdrawal.China.51. On the 8th, 25 enemy bombers carried out the biggest air attack of recent months on the important railway town of Loyang, Western Honan; considerable damage was caused.Aleutian Islands.52. U.S. aircraft continued their attacks on Kiska Island. On the 6th, a cargo ship in the harbour was left on fire and sinking, the wireless station was damaged and a seaplane was destroyed and another damaged on the water.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.53. Small numbers of bombs were dropped on the South or South-EastCoasts on six days of the week. On one night, the 11th/12th, bombs were droppedaround the mouth of the Tyne.Railway shops and locomotives were damaged at Brighton (12th). The SouthShields Gas Works were extensively damaged, but the gas supply was not&quot;affected (11th/12th).Casualties.54.
