///TICS DOOUffiriT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HIS PPJTANNIC MATE STY&apos;S governmentSECRET copy no. %oY/.P. ./42)47.217th October, 19:2. j. 0m&amp;  C^EKETMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National ServiceReduction in the Minimum Age of Compulsory Recruiting to the forces.     The requirements of- the Forces for the remainder of the current year were considered at a meeting of Ministers under the Chairmanship of theLord President on the 12..th October and I undertook to try and meet additional commitments by taking certain measures which could yield recruits, in the nearfuture.     The most important of these measures is the reduction of the calling up age from 18-g- to 18,     Without it the supply of men -will fall very far short of the newly agreed programme for the months of November and December and inparticular I should be unable to satisfy the urgent requirements of the Navy.2.     The minimum age in the National Service Acts has always been 18 butin practice the rrdnimum ago of calling up was originally 20 and later reducedto 19;   it was further reduced to 18-g- last December,     The reduction nowproposed to 18 will make it necessary to consider the&apos;position of apprentices and students and I should propose to make any adjustments that might berequired in the national interest,3,     Hen who reached the age of 18 up to. the 30th June last have alreadybeen registered and arc being called up at the present time.     In order tosecure for the Forces in December the necessary further supply of men between18 and 18-g- it will be necessary to hold a registration early in November ofmen who have reached tho age of 18 since 30th June and I should propose to register on 7th November a three months&apos; supply of men who reached the age of18 between 1st July and 30th September,     This cannot be done however withouta further Royal Proclamation, since the last Proclamation dates from 23rd july and does not cover men?who have reached the age of 18 since that. date.     Junderstand that arrangements could bo made for; a further Proclamation.to.be signed on Thursday next, 22nd October, and this would give time to arrangefor tho registration on 7th -November. . ;1 ... . .-. ;4.     I suggest that a statement should be made: in the House by way ofa private notice Question and Answer on Thursday, .22nd .October, in order thatthe House i and thc:?public may be informed of -the reduction of the calling-upago to 18;     I attach a draft of a suggested Question, and Answer, which prefersto tho fact that tho reduction of the calling up age does not affect theminimum age at which ;men called up.,to.thq Army are posted for service, overseas.5,     A further proposal,, that could&apos; not..oporato7in..time to yield recruitsfor November and December, but would yield, additional recruits in the .&apos;    &apos;..New Year would be to amond the National Service Acts in order.to enable mbnto be registered and medically examined before reaching the age :of-18, so.&quot; &apos;that they may be ready to bo posted to the^Forcos without delay on reaching;that agoj   about a further two . months - supply of men would result from such&apos;ameasure in tho Nevr Yoar. . .17hr,tevor. view, however, may.be taken of thisproposal an a means of increasing the supply of recruits to the Forces in theNew Year, it will still be neoessary to operate tho measures set out in&quot; thepreceding paragraphs (which do not involve legislation),in order to meet theprogramme for November rind December., - \        &apos;    &apos;&quot;. ,
I ask, therefore(1) that the minimum calling up ago for men should ho reduced from18-2- to 16(2) that arrangements should be made for a further Royal Proclamationon Thursday, 22nd Octoberj(3) that the attached Answer should be given in the House of commons to a private notice Question on that day;   and(4) that, in addition to the proposals in (1) to (3) above and forthe purpose of increasing the supply of men early in the New Year, Ishould be authorised to introduce a Bill immediately to amend theNational Service Acts so as to enable men to be registered and medically examined before reaching the age of 18.. E.B.Draft Private Notice Question and AnswerQUESTION   - .    -   -To ask the Minister of Labour and National Service whether he has any statement to make &quot;with regard to the minimum.age for compulsory recruitment of men to the Forces,ANSTZEKYes Sir.The lower age in the National Service Acts has always been 18, but inpractice the miiiimum age of calling up was originally 20 and was subsequentlyreduced first to 19 and last.December to 18-g-.    Recruitment has continued inthe last ten months on a largo scale without calling up men under the age of182, but the-stage has now been reached when in tho Opinion-1 of the government this further reduction in age can no longer be postponed and is indeed urgently. .;.necessary.    I will not, I am sure, bo expected to.go into detail aboutrecruitment for the. Forcesj   but I may say that there are requirements for allthe three Services that necessitate this step.His Majesty has today signed a further Proclamation as- a result of which -men who have reachod the age of 18 up to this date will be made liable to becalled up under the National Service Acts and I propose to register on .7th  November thc^se who reached the age of 18 bet-ween 1st July and30th Sopteniber, -both dates inclusive j   thoy will be medically examined later -in the month and called up to the Forces as required, and many of. them may expect to join in December.I will consider as usual what adjustments may be necessary in the national interest as regards apprentices and students,I sh6uld like to mako it clear&apos; that tho reduction in tho age of calling up doos not affect tho minimum age, namely 19* at which men called up to theArmy are posted for service-abroad.H.Q.478-72 J.L
