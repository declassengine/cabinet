secret.P. (42) 489.October 28, 1942.Copy No.WAR CABINET.POLITICAL SITUATION IN SOUTHERN IRELAND.Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I think the War Cabinet may be interested to see the enclosed note bySir John Maffey on the political situation in Southern Ireland.C. R. A.Dominions Office, S.W. 1,October 28. 1942.Note by Sir John Maffey.Although.Mr. de Valera with his prestige and personality is generally regarded as the one man to conduct the affairs of Eire in the world crisis, never-theless from the British and American point of view there is something attractivein the thought that his long innings may be coming to an end and that this austerestonewaller may give way to more generous performers. It is probable that therewill be a General Election to the Dail early in the New Year. Mr. Cosgrave tellsme in confidence that the Catholic Hierarchy have been asked to consent to theElection being held on a Sunday but that they have banned the suggestion.Clearly, therefore, steps for an Election are being taken.In weighing up what an Election may bring about, it is important to bearin mind that Neutrality has a stronger grip throughout the country than ever before and. that therefore at the polls no party will stand a chance which does notaffirm the hedgehog policy. We must read election addresses with full realisation of this fact and of the difficulties of any government here which might endeavourto swing over a public which has been drugged by the censorship, appalled bystories and some small experience of &quot; blitz &quot; and which, when it thinks at all,considers that it is under God.&apos;s special protection and is called upon to sufferonly negligible hardships owing to a war in which wicked and violent men havebeen plunged as a punishment of sin.This is a gloomy picture and since, with the prospect of a Second Front andan intensification of conflict on this side of the Atlantic, Great Britain and america may be compelled to take a stronger line with the Government of Eire,it is important to consider whether a change of government here may not introducesome ray of light into the scene.First let us consider the parties which will contend in an Election. Thenormal term of the present Dail would end in June 1943. Recent successes ofthe Labour party in the municipal elections have revealed that Mr. de Valera&apos;party (Fianna Fail) is losing its hold on the country. The reasons are perhaps not very obvious. Charges of mismanagement of essential supplies are not reallyvalid in these times, but they count. The main factors are probably the swingof the pendulum, social discontents and the wish to see new men in place of theold gang,[24551]
The Dail consists of 138 Deputies and the position to-day is : Fianna Fail &quot; Government&quot; ...      ...      ... 78Fine Gael. &quot;- Cosgrave &quot; ......... 44Labour     ...      ....      ... ...      ...      ... 9Independent        ...      ... ...      ...      ... 7138There is little doubt that in an election Fianna Fail will lose ground.Mr. Cosgrave, who expects an election in January, thinks Fianna Fail might bereduced to 50. He may be optimistic, but his picture seems to be something like this : Fianna Fail      ...      ... ...      ...        50Fine Gael        ...      ...      ...      ...      ...        45Labour    ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...        30Independent     ...       ...       ...       ...       ...        13.138The Labour Party in their present mood refused to co-operate with FiannaFail and will not serve Mr. de Valera as head of a government. On the otherhand Labour has not indicated to Mr. Cosgrave that they will act with him andFine Gael.If a coalition government of the three parties is formed, it would be headed by Mr. Cosgrave and Mr. cle Valera would disappear from the government. IfLabour ploughs a lonely furrow Fianna Fail and Fine Gael -would have to patchup an uneasy two-party government. If Mr. de Valera led this combineMr. Cosgrave would disappear, and vice versa. As the head of such a combineMr. de Valera would, if he wished, and particularly if Mr. Frank Aikendisappeared from the Cabinet, be in a position to administer neutrality andcensorship with a more generous regard for our interests.&quot;The moment seemed to me opportune to explore with Mr. Cosgrave the shape of things to come, and in the course of a private talk at his house yesterday(Sunday) afternoon I said, to him that I fully realised that he could not get support in this Election except on the Neutrality ticket.   But after the Election the war would still be raging and would probably present problems of grave moment toIreland.  It was clear that the war at sea was the crux to-day.  The development and success of a Second Front depended on the outcome of the war at sea and ofour measures in countering, the submarine menace.  The action taken by Americain Liberia just announced was significant.   In our island we faced the long coast-line of Europe, seized and dominated by Germany.  If America looked forelbow-room to develop her co-operation with us on land and sea, clearly Eire cameright into the strategic picture.   How did he regard this prospect ?   He said atonce and with emphasis that it would be quite hopeless for any Government toattempt to change the policy of neutrality.    The hold which neutrality had established in the nation&apos;s mind seemed to him constantly to strengthen ratherthan to diminish.   I said that the question might arise in a form in which merenegation would not be taken as the end of the matter.   It would be too much to expect America to go clown because her Irish friends Withheld assistance which inthe last resort could be taken if not granted.    He said : &quot; That is why to-dayEire is afraid of America.&quot;   I said that there was obviously good reason for ameasure of apprehension.  There were 20 million Irish Americans in the UnitedStates, and I could not see how Eire could stand out against an approach if it took the form of an appeal to Irishmen from Irish America.  Mr. Cosgrave said :&quot; That would be the only possible line of approach.&quot;   This shows, at any rate,that he does not close his mind to such a development, but at the same time the conversation revealed the present firm and unyielding adherence of all parties tothe policy of neutrality.As regards the Labour attitude to this question, it has always been notice-able in the Dail how readily they play up the anti-British note, whether relevantor not; but that is a politician^ trick in this country and Mr. de Valera is himselfa past-master in its use. If it came to a show-down with America and GreatBritain on the neutrality issue, Labour would, I surmise, be disposed to inclineits ear to practical considerations more readily than Mr. de Valera, as Labourcan think of markets while Mr. de Valera thinks of martyrs.
My talk with Mr. Cosgrave confirms the views expressed to me recently byDr. 0&apos;Higgins (brother of the late well-known Kevin 0&apos;Higgins), a Front Bencherof the Fine Gael party and likely to hold office in any reconstruction of Govern-ment. Mr. 0&apos;Higgins pointed out that a feature of Fine Gael, which may operate in our favour, is their regard for Mr. Churchill, whose part in the Treaty negotia-tions of 1921 is not forgotten by their leaders to-day.Indeed, on the basis of the Treaty, men like Kevin 0&apos;Higgins would havebuilt up a position for Ireland in the British Commonwealth and could have madea statesmanlike approach to the Partition problem. But de Valera was jealous ofthe rising star of Michael Collins. It was his vanity which plunged his country-men into civil war, sharpened the animosities of Partition and created the modernEire. Since those days he and Cosgrave have exchanged no word except in thebitter clash of public debate. But, in spite of all this, or because of all this,&quot; Dev &quot; exercises a mighty sway over the emotions of Irishmen and. to give himhis due, I can see that his mind has mellowed somewhat, though its saccharinecontent is still definitely low.
