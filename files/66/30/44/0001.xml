THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1942.MOST SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 514.November 6, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY-,------It is requested that special care ma/ be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS BY BOMBER COMMAND FOR FORT-NIGHT ENDING 1200 HOURS, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1942.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Air.ITALY has suffered its first concentrated incendiary raids, and has been attacked for the first time from this country in daylight. Genoa has been attacked twice by night, Milan by day and by night; Turin and Savona havebeen bombed.A highly successful daylight attack was carried out by Lancasters on theSchneider armament works at Le Creusot; Kiel and Cologne were attacked by night.Owing largely to unsuitable weather there is an unusually long list ofphotographic reconnaissances outstanding; full assessment of damage on anumber of raids previously reported in these summaries is correspondinglydelayed.Operations.Bombinq.Night-Wismar and Aircraft FactorvKielCologneGenoaGenoaMilanDay-Le Creusot (Armament Works)Le Havre (Shipping)  ...Hengelo (Stork Diesel Works).Den Helder (Docks)Hengelo (Stork Diesel Works).Anti-Submarine Patrols   12,13Milan    ......Bremen  ...Hanover ...Emden   ...Minister...Osnabruck[24596]12/13 October13/1415/1622/2323/2424/25171515151615and 1624202020202059 aircraft288289113112719423416 .,,28 . .,881     .,,1111b

On this occasion itwas attacked by 288 aircraft, the objectives being the Germania Shipyard onthe East side of the Estuary and the centre of the city on the West side.An effective smoke screen was anticipated, and the Pathfinders were accordingly directed to illuminate the lakes 5 miles East of Kiel so that crewscould obtain accurate bearings. In the event, two smoke screens were inoperation one completely covering the Estuary and shipyards, the other covering the entrance to the Kiel Canal. Crews were thus deprived of two of the mostoutstanding landmarks close to their targets. The lakes, however, were effectivelylit up, and the majority of crews were confident that their bombs fell near theaiming points.The extent of damage revealed by day photographs is not comparable to more recent achievements. It is probable that a large proportion of bombs fell throughthe smoke screen into the Estuary between the two aiming points, with the resultthat the incendiaries which fell on the city and docks did not overwhelm theA.R.P. organisation and did not therefore develop into substantial fires. Thereis also a strong probability that some crews bombed the clocks and industrial area at the Holtenau end of the Canal 3 miles North of the City. photographic reconnaissance of this area is awaited.Shipping at Le Havre (15th October).A force of 23 Bostons attacked two ships at Le Havre by daylight. One ofthem was not hit, but several bombs fell among buildings on the dock side. Therewere several very near misses on the second ship see Print No. 1 resulting insevere damage below the water line.Cologne (15th/16th October).A force of 289 aircraft was despatched to attack Cologne, but conditions were very unfavourable, and the Pathfinders illuminated several towns, includingBonn. As a result, though there Avas no heavy concentration of attack, a numberof towns in the area suffered.   Detailed results are not yet available.Le Creusot (17th October).The Schneider armament works at Le Creusot were attacked by 94 Lancastersin daylight. The force flew below 1,000 feet during the whole of the outwardflight, which included 330 miles over Occupied Territory. The total flight was over 1,700 miles.The main attack was made on the factory from a height of 4,000 feet; asmall formation of six aircraft attacked the transformer and switching stationfrom 500 feet.  Only one aircraft failed to return.The Schneider works are the Krupps of France. Their total area is 287 acres and their chief products big guns and locomotives.Ten thousand workers were employed at this works and all plants were fullyactive. It is believed that the transformer and switching station was destroyed,thus depriving the works completely of electrical power. It is known that thereis a great shortage of transformers in France and Germany, so much so thatthey are believed to be virtually irreplaceable under existing conditions.
So far, it has only l)een possible to obtain photographic cover of a few of thefactory buildings.   The damage revealed is considerable.In the processing works, the locomotive machine shop, the turbine buildingshop and plate bending shop have been severely damaged, and a number of other buildings, including a 4-bay shed, have been totally or partially destroyed.In the steel works, the general machine shops have received two direct hitswhich have caused the partial collapse of the roof and which must have destroyedmuch machinery; one end of a large shop has disappeared; a hit on another partof the works has caused the collapse of a large area of roof and frame work;more than half of a large warehouse has been flattened, and there are many otherincidents of destruction and blast damage in the store yards and among adjoiningbuildings.Prints Nos. 2 and 3 show some of this destruction, but the full success ofthis raid cannot yet be gauged. Complete photographic cover will of coursereveal only external damage; but it is hoped that, as in the case of the Renaultworks, ground sources will give the full story in due course.Genoa (22nd/23rd ancl 23rd/24th October).The first of these raids was an outstanding success. Of a force of 112Lancasters; 99 dropped their loads of incendiaries and high explosives on thecity, and all returned safely. Night photographs show that fires had started25 minutes after the attack opened and had spread widely by the time the lastaircraft left 30 minutes later. A Plot of night photographs is attached(Print No. 5) which indicates the degree of concentration achieved, and print. 6, taken 44 minutes after the attack opened, shows substantial fires near theaiming point.A force of 122 aircraft, consisting of Stirlings, Halifaxes and Wellingtons,attacked on the following night, when the aiming point was shifted to the westend of the City. The weather was not so good as on the previous night; cloudsobscured the target and crews had to descend very low to find it. Crews who could not find Genoa bombed Turin and Savona. Night photographs showsubstantial fires at the latter.The Italian news bulletin admitted that bombs fell on Genoa and Turin andthat considerable damage was done in Savona. It was also announced that many casualties occurred in Genoa through stampeding at the entrances to air raidshelters.Milan (24th October, 24th/25th October).With a population of 992,000, this is the second largest city in Italy, and isone of the most important supply centres for the armed forces. It has grownround a very ancient and exceptionally congested nucleus and, even in the outersuburbs and industrial areas, the houses are unusually closely packed together.The great armament and aircraft factories of the Breda firm are centred here,and there are numbers of other factories producing tanks, cables, rubber andmilitary equipment of every kind. Milan is also a most important centre of rail communications.The attack was made on the afternoon of the 24th October by 73 of a forceof 88 Lancasters. The round trip was over 1,700 miles, the outward flight andthe attack being carried out in daylight. There were clouds down to 4,000 feetover the target, but crews went below them and saw their bombs and incendiariesfalling on the centre of the city; one crew bombed from 200 feet. The attack was over in twenty-five minutes, and the last aircraft to leave observed at least three large and many small fires.Owing to poor light and to the low height at which the attack was made,few photographs were taken, sufficient, however, to confirm the crews&apos; opinions of the success of this raid. Prints Nos. 7 and 8, which show fires starting in thecentre of the City, are good examples.A force of 71 aircraft attacked the city again during the night. It was still cloud-covered, but the glow of fires started during the afternoon helpedcrews to identify the target.It is interesting to note that on the 18th September, after the heavy raidon Bremen, 750 building employees were drafted there from Milan. their services will now be sorely missed in their home town.Minor Daylight Attacks.Ten Wellingtons attacked the Essen area on the 22nd October in daylightwith cloud cover, and a further seven attacked the same area on the following[24596] b 2

day. Included in their loads were four 4,000-lb. bombs, the first to be dropped on the Ruhr in daylight.Four other Wellingtons made a successful low-level attack through a gap in the clouds on Lingen (35 miles N.W. of osnabruck). where there ai-e importantrailway workshops.High-flying Mosquitos have attacked Bremen. Minden and Varel (southof Wilhelmshaven). In addition. Mosquitos made low-level attacks on a numberof factories in North-West Germany and Holland including the Stork DieselWorks at Hengelo. At this target photographs show considerable roof damage to the Diesel Motor store and to the iron foundry, and a number of workshopshave been demolished.Information regarding Previous Raids.Oslo.Photographic evidence is now confirmed by reliable ground sources. Themain damage to the Gestapo Headquarters was in the rear of the building; thedelayed-action bombs, which must necessarily be used in such low-flying attacks,passed clean through the Gestapo building and exploded next cloor.An observer regretfully remarks that if the bomb had been only three metreslower it would have hit the centre of the front facade. He adds : &quot; Germanairmen and flak officers are impressed by the precision bombing, which wasfantastically cleverly carried out; there are not so many German flags on thehouses any longer.&quot;.Krefeld.Reports from reliable ground sources refer to extensive damage in the Rhineharbour at Uerdingen, three miles East of Krefeld, where a considerable numberof barges, tugs, rolling stock and fuel tanks were destroyed.Munich.It is now known that considerable destruction was done to the B.M.W.aero-engine works as wrell as to some workshops which assemble heavy guns.Kassel.It is now known that, in addition to the destruction previously recorded, theOtto Fennel works, which produced binoculars, were completely destroyed inthe raid of the 27th/28th August,Hochst,During the attack on Frankfurt on the 8th/9th September, the I. G. FarbenChemical Works at Hochst (three miles West of the City) were severely damaged.Five buildings in the West part of the works were destroyed; three of these producedbenzylchloride and chlbrsulphonic acid and the other two were large laboratories.Mining.The following results have been reported : . (i) On the 28th August the German vessel Walter (177 tons) was mined, * and sunk in the Oresund.On the 9th October the Danish ferry Dan (799 tons), which pliesbetween Helsingborg and Helsingor, was&apos; damaged by a mine whenleaving Helsingor. The ferry had to be beached and the ferry service was suspended.(iii) On the 9th October a submarine was mined and sunk oft&apos; Lorient.Germany&apos;s Housing Problem.The Ministry of Economic Warfare has made a preliminary assessment ofair raid damage to German dwellings in which the following significantdeductions are made : &quot;In the period the 1st March-31st August, 1942, 322,440 Germandwellings in the 22 built-up areas considered have either been demolished,rendered uninhabitable or require immediate repair. 644,880 persons havebeen un-housed.
&quot; Damage on this scale presents the German authorities with a serious and complex problem which must be straining their resources in a field wherethey are unprepared. They will have to decide how much to divert building resources to this purpose from other economic activities or how far to submit to the deterioration in health, morale and working efficiency of labour byforcing the affected persons to continue to live in damaged dwellings duringthe winter.&quot;It is possible that, by requisitioning all available accommodation, byovercrowding undamaged houses and by evacuation of women and children.Germany has been able to meet the demand, but preparations for attacks onthe present scale had not been made. It is therefore certain that many of theexpedients adopted are of a most temporary nature, and it may be that&apos; saturation &apos; point is very near.&apos;&apos;A prominent neutral, who is particularly well informed on the conditionsin Germany, has said that he is now convinced that the material damage causedby our raids is beginning to have considerable effect on the average Germancitizen, because the replacement of ordinary articles is becoming a major problem and will, if the bombing continues, become acute within the next few months.When asked how he thought we should win this war his answer was: &quot;Thelargest individual factor will be your bombing policy. The more you can expandit, the quicker you can apply it, the swifter will be the result.&quot;Morale of the German Population.A reliable informant reports that our recent raids have made a deepimpression on the Germans and in certain districts the populace has given wayto panic. This is not always confined to those cities actually attacked. Forinstance, in Baden Baden, which is some 20 miles south of Karlsruhe, theGauleiter had to make several appeals to the citizens in order to avert panic.The informant states that confusion after raids is heightened by an acute shortage of roofing materials and glass. The winter will make the problemworse, for it has become impossible quickly to replace the thousands of windowsbroken in bombed towns as was done last winter.The emergency food supplies for the whole of the Stuttgart district, whichwere stored in Karlsruhe, were completely destroyed during the. raid of the2nd/3rd September, and this has led to the issue of instructions to all Mayorsof the larger towns to move the municipal food depots into the country. Theinformant, who has met many Germans and persons of other nationalities coming from Germany, is convinced that heavy and methodical bombings are likely tobring the war to an end far- more quickly than is generally anticipated.A.
