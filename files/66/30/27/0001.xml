Conclusions.(i) In the light of various changes affecting both sides of the shippingbalance-sheet which have occurred since the submission of our First Report, we now estimate the gap between imports and net consumption of imports in the18 months ending mid-1943 at 7 - 4 million tons as against 8 - 4 million tons in our first Report (S.C. (42) 20).*(2) On the other hand, we now estimate the maximum saving of import requirements which could be obtained by running down stocks at 5 &apos;7 million tons(of which 4 - 9 millions are materials and - 8 millions food) as compared with6 -15 million tons in our First Report.(3) Even, therefore, if stocks are run down to the fullest practicable extentthere will still be a deficiency of some If million tons in the first half of 1943 iomeet which American assistance is vitally and urgently needed if our war effort is not to be seriously crippled.(4) To reduce stocks to this extent, however, by mid-1943 would be ahazardous expedient since, unless sufficient assistance to rebuild stocks werespeedily given during the second half of the year, it would leave us with no margin to draw upon, at a stage in the war when unexpected calls upon our*shipping resources might at any time be made. It will be recalled that in w.P. (42) 294 the Lord President recommended to the War Cabinet that plans should be prepared on the assumption that destocking during this period shouldnot exceed 4 million tons. To ensure this, American assistance would be neededduring the first half of 1943 sufficient to provide a total addition of about  million tons to our imports.(5) Our need for American assistance during the second half of 1343depends to some extent on the amount of assistance given us during the first halfof the year and the resulting position of our stocks. Assuming that the fu\3  million tons referred to in Conclusion (4) above is provided, pur need f o-assistance during the second half of the year may be placed at 4 million to of imports, this being the amount required to cover our consumption and maintain our stock position unchanged.. Should, however, the United StatesGovapjiment find themselves unable to provide more than the If million tons* Also circulated as W.P. (42) 293.24554] b
of imports which we must at all costs secure, our stock position would have become precarious and it would be of importance that it should be restored assoon as possible to safer levels. If our object were to restore stocks to the levelcontemplated by the Lord Presidents Committee, American assistance of theorder of 5f million tons of imports would be needed during the second half ot1943.(6) No indication has as yet been received from the United States Govern-ment of the amount of additional assistance which they may be in a position to afford us. The present uncertainty regarding the amount and timing of this assistance hampers the drawing-up of departmental programmes and plans for production.B. Recommendations.We accordingly recommend (1) That a clear-cut appeal should be addressed to the United StatesGovernment at the earliest possible date for assistance on the scale indicatedin Conclusions (1)-(S) above, namely, for such additional tonnage as will enable us to import an additional 7  million tons during the year 1943. If possible,assistance during the first half of the year should be sufficient to provide importsof 3  million tons. But, in any event, assistance great enough to provide If million tons of imports in that period is an absolute and urgent necessity, the vital natureof which cannot be too strongly stressed.(2) That, pending a reply to this appeal, imports should be allocated between departments in the period ending mid-1943 in the following manner: (a) That the import of munitions into this country as programmed by theMinistry of Production should be given priority over other imports.(b) That the Ministry of War Transport should endeavour to secure to theMinistry of Food an import (other than from Eire) covering theirminimum requirements of 15-43 million tons for the 18 month period ending mid-4943 whatever the total volume of importing capacity.(c) That  all  imports  for  which  shipping  is  available  in  excess  of15-43 million tons reserved for the Ministry of Food should accrue tothe Ministry of Production.(d) That in drawing up plans for the future, departments should for thetime being assume that imports in the 18 months ending mid-1943 will amount to 34-75 million tons, the figure which we might expect toobtain if American assistance in the first half of 1943 did not exceedIf million tons, the lower of the two figures mentioned in Recommen-dation (1) above.
PART 2.-REPORT.I. Introduction.1. In our First Report, S.C. (42) 20, written four months ago we set out to forecast the import requirements of the United Kingdom over the eighteen-month period ending in mid-1943, to estimate the volume of imports for which shipping was likely to be available, and to suggest various methods wherebyimports and requirements might be brought into balance. In the present report we attempt to bring these forecasts and estimates up to date in the light ofvarious changes which have affected both sides of the shipping balance sheet. Wedo not in this Report seek to examine afresh ways and means of effectingeconomies in the consumption of imports or in the use of shipping. Nor do we seek to project our forecasts further into the future. We hope to present, inDecember, a further Report in which requirements and imports will be estimated as closely as possible to the end of 1943. Here only broad indications are given as to their probable order of magnitude in the second half of 1943. Since the statements of minimum import requirements approved by the Lord presidents committee in February of this year serve as a guide to the allocation of importsbetween departments only till the end of this year, we propose for the approvalof Ministers a formula of apportionment in the eighteen-month period endingII. The Measure of the Deficiency.(a) Importing Capacity of Available Shipping.2. In our First Report we estimated the amount of ocean-borne non-tankerimports, exclusive of additional American assistance, at about 25^ million tonsin 1942 and about 9^ million tons in the first six months of 1943. Since that report was written, a number of factors have supervened to diminish imports,and these may continue to operate for some months. They include delaysresulting from the introduction of convoys on the Eastern seaboard of America,the adoption of more circuitous routes for certain shipping and the generaldislocation inseparable from preparation for major military operations. Non-tanker imports for 1942 may now be put at 23^ to 24 million tons, while for thefirst half of 1943 we adopt a figure of 9 to 9^ million tons. In the latter caseparticularly, the possible range of variation is very much wider than the half-million tons shown here. All these figures, it should be noted, relate to thequantity of imports which could be shipped without any increase (other than thetonnage accruing under the Todd Agreement, and other than the civil imports which may be brought into this country in Bolero ships) in the volume of UnitedStates assistance. The following are the principal assumptions upon which these estimates are based : (a) that the output of ocean-going   non-tanker tonnage in the UnitedKingdom, Canada and Australia, excluding ships constructed on british account in the United States, will be approximately 1 - 5 million gross tons in 1942, and -87 million gross tons in the first half of 1943,as compared with 1-4 and -8 million gross tons respectively as estimated in our First Report;(b) that losses from all causes of ocean-going non-tanker tonnage operating in British interests will be about 3 - 5 million gross tons in 1942 and1-5 million gross tons in the first half of 1943, as compared with 3-3and 1-6 million gross tons respectively, as estimated in our first report;(c) that the tonnage allocated to the fighting services, which at the end ofMay was about 4-5 million gross tons, will rise to about 5-5 million gross tons by the end of this year, and will increase to about - 7 million gross tons on the average for the first six months of 1943.*(d) that there will be no material alteration in the tonnage specificallyrequired for civil imports into areas other than the United Kingdom.* The assumptions made regarding the Service demand on tonnage in S.C. (42) 20 are not easily comparable with those made in the present Report. In effect, however, the present estimates are very close to the earlier estimates as far as 1942 is concerned, but slightlv lowerfor the first half of 1943.[24554]
(b) Consumption of Imports.3. Four months ago, in our First Report, we put net consumption* ofimportable food and materials at 27-5 million tons in 1942 and 13-9 million tonsin the first half of 1943. These estimates can now be reduced somewhat as aresult of (a) an increase of 920,000 tons in the estimate of home-grown food supplies 540,000 tons in 1942 and 380,000 tons in the first half of 1943-resulting mainly from a bountiful harvest;(b) the decision of the Lord Presidents Committee (L.P. (42) 62nd Meeting)that national flour should be diluted to the extent of 5 per cent, withbarley and oats. (This measure, coming into force at the beginningof 1943, is expected to yield an import economy of 150,000 tons in thefirst half of 1943);(c) elimination of the special winter rations of fats and sugar granted lastyear (150,000 tons), and reduction in consumption of certain foods(compared with previous estimates), particularly wheat and flour,canned meat, dried and condensed milk, sugar and cocoa, amountingto almost 1 million tons over the eighteen-month period (i.e., some 2 percent of the previous estimate of total consumption);(d) the decision of the War Cabinet (W.M. (42) 98th Conclusions) thateconomies amounting to 600.000 tons should be effected in the con-sumption of materials, combined with the failure of raw materialconsumption to attain the level forecast for 1942. The former savingis being achieved by the allocation of reduced supplies of steel toconsuming Departments (400,000 tons) and by reductions in the. consumption of newsprint and othei- paper, cotton and woollengoods, packing materials, linoleum, &amp;c. (200,000 tons).4. Estimates of net consumption of food and. materials as now revised are presented in the following table, side by side with the original estimate tofacilitate&apos; comparison : (Million tons.)

About 300,000 tons extra consumption in the first half of 1943-100,000 tons of food and 200,000 tons of materials-has been allowed for this factor. No account has, however, been taken of possibledemands on food resulting from War Office or other requirements in connectionwith military operations in Europe. A statistical analysis of the net consumptionof food and materials is given in Appendix A.5. Imports of &quot;Munitions and Miscellaneous&quot; are running rather lowerthis year than was previously expected, but on the other hand, thanks to theexpansion of the North American munitions output, the estimated import ofmunitions into this country in the first half of 1943 has had to be raised. It is,unfortunately, impossible at present to forecast precisely what North Americanoutput will amount to, what proportion thereof will be assigned to theatres ofBritish responsibility, and what part of the latter will be shipped to this country.* &quot; Net Consumption &quot; is denned in our First Report as &quot; consumption hiss home production,less any imports from Eire not included in homo production.&quot; Net consumption can only be covered out of imports plus stock reductions.
The figure of munitions imports given below for the first half of 1943 must,therefore, be assumed to contain a margin of variation of perhaps half a million tons.(Million tons.)as estimated As at present estimated.Imports of Munitions    ln sc.Non-and  Miscellaneous      (42) 20.

In comparing prospective imports with prospective consumption ofimports it is convenient to count together with the net consumption of food and materials those items in the &quot; Munitions and Miscellaneous.&quot; import programme which are of a non-munitions character, leaving &quot;Munitions&quot; which enjoypriority over other forms of import as a separate category.

Action to Bridge the Gap.(a) Economies in the Consumption of Imports and in the Service Use of Shipping.7. Possible economies in the consumption of imports in this country were discussed in some detail in our First Report while the progress made by theServices in the economical use of shipping was examined in our Second Report(S.C. (42) 45)* of the 21st July, 1942. Since the appearance of these Reports,decisions have been taken, bearing on such economies, by the War Cabinet andby the Lord Presidents Committee. We do not feel justified in this Report inretraversing this familiar ground.(b) Destocking.8. In our First Report (S.C. (42) 20) we estimated that if stocks of import-able goods were reduced to their minimum working levels by the 30th June, 1943,there might be a saving in imports amounting to 6-15 million tons over thepreceding eighteen month period. To this total food contributed 1 - 05 and materials 5-1 million tons. JJestocking of this order, we then said, could be safelyembarked upon only if it were morally certain that the shipping situation of theUnited Nations in the second half of 1943, and thereafter, would be such as topermit us to import on a scale sufficient to cover our reasonable requirementswithout further drawing upon stocks. The Lord Presidents Committee, in con-sidering our Report, felt that such a degree of destocking would. be undulydangerous, and recommended to the War Cabinet which accepted.the recommenda-tion that plans should, be prepared on the assumption that a reduction in import requirements totalling about 5-g million tons (of which 4 million tons were tocome from destocking) would have to be secured over the period of eighteen monthsup to the end of June; 1943.   (W.P. (42) 294 and W.M. (42) 98th Conclusions.)* Also circulated as W.P. (42) 310.
9. Departments have now re-examined tihe limits of possible destocking overthe eighteen-month period. They consider it important to maintain adequatestocks, particularly in view (ft) of the sudden and incalculable encroachments thatmay be made on our importing capacity in the course of 1943 by militaryoperations and (b) of the additional requirements of food and possibly other supplies that may arise directly and indirectly from such operations in Europe.The Ministry of Food consider any reduction in food stocks inadvisable in thesecircumstances. If, however, it is decided that stocks must be run down to dangerlevels at end June 1943, and assuming food imports in the second half of 1943at least sufficient to prevent further destocking, the Ministry of Food nowestimate the maximum aggregate reduction over the eighteen-month period since january 1942 in stocks of foodstuffs imported in ocean-going non-tanker tonnageat 800.000 tons. In the case of imported materials the Ministry of Productionnow estimate the maximum possible stock reduction of materials over the eighteen-month period at 4-9 million tons : this very drastic reduction assumes that afterthe end of June imports of materials will increase by the large amount necessaryto enable consumption to be covered by imports as from 1st July. Maximumdestocking of food and materials for the eighteen-month period is thus estimatedat 5-7 million tons as compared with the figure of 6-15 million tons given in our first Report.IY. Need for American Assistance.10. In July last the Lord President (in W.P. (42) 294) regarding 4 million tons as the appropriate figure for destocking in the eighteen-month period ending the 30th June, 1943, recommended to the War Cabinet that the United states authorities should be pressed to increase the tonnage to be allocated in the first half of 1943 to areas for which we were responsible, to an extent sufficient tobring in at least 3 million tons of imports during that period. Since that timethe estimated import deficiency has declined by 1 million tons (see paragraph 6),but, on the other hand, the consumption economies of 1-4 million tons, on whichthe Lord President relied in part to meet the deficiency, have now been applied,and allowance has been made for their effects in the new estimate of the deficiency. These measures are therefore no longer available as a means of reducing the deficiency. Thus the need for American assistance is now some400.000 tons greater than it was. The present position is shown in the followingtable :  -Eighteen-month Period ending Mid-194z3.Million tons.(a) Net consumption of food, materials, &amp;c, plus imports ofmunitions = ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      40-4(&amp;) Maximum safe destocking as defined by the Lord President^Committee (W.P. (41) 294) -     ............        4-0(c) Import requirements ( (a) less (b) )    ...      ...       ...       ...      36-4(d) Ocean-borne imports   ...       ...       ...      ...       ...       ...      33-0(e) Need for American assistance ((c) less id) ) ...       ...       ...        3-411. If, on the other hand, stocks instead of declining by 4 million tons were allowed to fall by 5-7 million tons, i.e., to the minimum working levels illustratedin Appendix B. in spite of the dangers which that would involve, the need for american assistance would be, not 3 - 4, but only 1 - 7 million tons . Evenif this latter policy is adopted, it is clear that, in the absence of restrictions on consumption of imports far more drastic than any yet contemplated, there will still be a considerable deficiency in the first half of 1943, to meet which american assistance is vitally and urgently necessary.12. The War Cabinet, on the 28th July, 1942 (W.M. (42) 98th Conclusions),decided that an approach should be made to the United States Government,asking them to give us a definite undertaking that they would allocate to areas for which we were responsible sufficient tonnage to enable us to carry through anon-tanker import programme of 52 million tons in 1942 and 1943.13. The estimates of net consumption and of munitions import requirementscontained in the present Report permit a certain modification of the assumptionunderlying this decision, that the figure of 52 million tons represented an
irreducible minimum import. We saw in paragraph 10 that if 4 million tons were to be regarded as maximum permissible destocking, import requirements for the eighteen-month period ending mid-1943 would amount to 36-4 million tons. Assuming that no additional American assistance is likely to have anysubstantial effect upon imports in 1942, the latter may, as in paragraph 2, be put at 23-75 million tons. This would leave an import requirement for the first halfof 1943 of 12-65 (or approximately 12f million tons). Import requirements inthe second half of 1943 are, presumably since stocks have already been reducedto a safe minimum by mid-1943 to be regarded as at least equal to net consump-tion of food, materials, &amp;c, plus import requirements of munitions. We havenot as yet made a close estimate of net consumption in the second half of 1943 we propose to do this in a further Report in December but in the first half of1943 it is estimated (see paragraph 6) to amount to 14-4 million tons, and we see no reason to expect it to exceed 14-J million in the second half of the year.On this basis import requirements for the year 1943 as a whole work out at some271 million tons, and for the two years 1942 and 1943, at some 51 million tons.14. The above estimate of import requirements is calculated on the assump-tion of a stock reduction of 4 million tons over the eighteen-month period. If,however, stocks were to be cut down by 5-7 million tons by mid-1943 to the levelsillustrated in Appendix B and held at those levels for the remainder of the year,import requirements would be approximately 49  million tons in the two years,or say, 23f million tons in 1942, 11 million tons in the first half of 1943. and14J million tons in the second half of 1943. It should be borne in mind, however,that at this level of imports stocks would have to remain at extremely low levelsduring the entire second half of 1943. at a time when our imports may well be exposed to the risk of interruption. It may well be thought reasonable that ifimport requirements are put as low as 11 million tons in the first half of 1943,they should be raised in the second half of 1943 to 16^ million tons so as to permit a recovery of stocks by the end of the year to the level judged appropriate by theLord Presidents Committee.15. The estimate of American assistance necessary to enable us to meet our import requirements is set forth in tabular form below on three hypotheses :A. Stock reduction of 4 million tons in the eighteen-month period endingmid-1943, and constant stocks thereafter to the end of 1943.B. Stock reduction of 5 - 7 million tons in the eighteen-month period endingmid-1943 and stock-building of 1 - 7 million tons in the second half of1943.C. Stock reduction of 5-7 million tons in the eighteen-month period endingmid-1943 and constant stocks to the end of 1943.The estimates for the second half of 1943 are very tentative.(Million tons.)

on the assumption, among others, that the minimum United Kingdom dry imports,essential to the unimpaired conduct of the war effort were 25 and 27 million tonsin 1942 and 1943 respectively. The Report went on to show that an average of500,000 gross tons of American shipping, additional to the programmed alloca-tions, would be required during the nine months ending the 31st March, 1943. no direct request was made, however, for an assurance of American assistance on this scale, and no response to the suggestion contained in the Combined ShippingAdjustment Board&apos;s Report has been received from the United States Govern-ment.*17. In order to ship the additional 3-i million tons of imports in the first half,and 4 million tons in the second half, of 1943, for which, on Hypothesis A ofparagraph 15, we stand in need of American assistance, an average of some-85 million gross tons (2-8 million deadweight tons) of shipping would berequired throughout the first half, rising to an average of about 2-1 million grosstons (3-2 million deadweight tons) throughout the second half of the year.If Hypothesis B is adopted, on the other hand (i.e., an additional If million tons is imported in the first half year and 5f million tons in the second half year), anaverage of about -9 million gross tons (1-4 million deadweight tons) of shippingwill be required throughout the first half year, rising to about 3 million gross tons (4-6 million deadweight tons) throughout the second half. Whetherthe United States will be able to spare such a quantity as this out oftheir new production depends partly on the degree to which they decide to utilisetheir shipbuilding capacity and partly on the extent of the military obligations which they intend to assume. What the latter may amount to we do not know;but if they exceed in scope the requirements on account of &quot; Bolero,&quot; as these were estimated at the end of July, there may be very considerable difficulty in finding shipping to enable us to import an additional 7\ million tons in the year1943 as a Avhole, and still greater difficulty in providing us with 3-1 million tonsout of the 7-g million in the first half of the year.V. Conclusion.(a) American Assistance.18. The principal conclusion to which we are led by our review of the ship-ping situation is that it is of paramount importance to obtain an assurance oftimely and adequate American assistance in the first half of 1943. Even if wedestock by mid-1943 to the maximum extent practicable, we shall be in absoluteneed of United States assistance to the extent of If million tons in the first halfof the year. To reduce stocks, however, by mid-1943 to the full extent which thiswould imply, would be a hazardous expedient, since, unless sufficient assistanceto rebuild stocks were speedily given during the second half of the year, we shouldbe left with no margin to draw upon at a time when interruptions of supply and emergency demands might easily arise from a period of active warfare. If, how-ever, destocking on this scale is to be avoided, the only alternative (in the absenceof further restrictions on consumption) would be that further American tonnageshould be diverted to our use at a time when it may be urgently needed in other directions.19. Our need for American assistance during the second half of 1943depends to some extent on the amount of assistance given us during the first half of the year and the resulting position of our stocks. If our object were toensure that stocks by the end of the year should not be less than those con tern-plated by the Lord Presidents Committee, American assistance over the year as a whole would be required to provide not less than 7-g million tons of imports.20. We therefore recommend that a clear-cut appeal should be addressed tothe United States Government at the eai^liest ijossible date for such additionaltonnage as will enable us to import an additional 7-g million tons during the year.If possible, assistance during the first half of the year should be sufficient toprovide imports of 3-g million tons.  But in any event assistance great enough to.* It has been represented to us that the United States Government is more likely to respondfavourably to an appeal for aid in meeting some specific emergency than to a request for a promise of assistance based upon long term statistical forecasts of our shipping situation. Suchan appeal for aid has recently been transmitted at our request to the War Shipping Administrationby the Minister of War Transport. The assistance asked for amounts to 15 additional ships amonth from North America to the Indian Ocean theatres, for the period of four months ending81st January, 1943, and is necessary in order that the minimum import requirements of thesetheatres may be met at a time when severe calls on our own shipping are being made- elsewhere.
provide If million tons of imports in that period is an absolute and urgent necessity, the vital nature of which cannot be too strongly stressed.(b) A llocation of Imports between Departments.21. In February of this year the Lord Presidents Committee sanctioneddepartmental statements of minimum import requirements for 1942, and therebysupplied a guide to the relative apportionment of imports for the year, thoughaggregate imports have not attained the figure of 26 million originally eontem-plated. Now, however, in view of the changes in departmental requirements andin import prospects it may be opportune to suggest a new basis of allocation,designed to be operative until mid-1948.22. The uncertainty which attaches to the amount of American assistance we may obtain, to Service demands upon our shipping, to the import of munitionsinto this country and to other factors, makes it impossible simply to divide up aknown total of imports between the importing departments. The same circum-stances in our view make it unwise to establish a rigid percentage allocation ofimports between departments which would remain unaffected by changes in thetotal value of imports. On the other hand, a system whereby the share of each ofthe importing departments would depend upon expectations regarding the total volume of imports, though attractive in conception, would be difficult to administer.23. Bearing in mind that import requirements of food are much less capableof variation than are those of materials, we recommend to Ministers the followingarrangement:  (a) That the import of munitions into this country as programmed by theMinistry of Production should be given priority over other imports.(b) That the Ministry of War Transport should endeavour to secure to theMinistry of Food an import (other than from Eire) of 15-43 million tons for the eighteen month period ending mid-1943, whatever thetotal volume of importing capacity.(c) That all imports for which shipping is available, in excess of the15 - 43 million tons reserved for the Ministry of Food, should accrue tothe Ministry of Production.24. Departments require to make some assumption regarding the volumeof their prospective imports as a basis for production planning. Therefore, inspite of the uncertainty surrounding our import prospects, it is necessary tomake an operational assumption regarding total imports. As has been&quot; stated inparagraph 20 above, we regard, additional American assistance to the extent of1-f million tons of imports as an absolute necessity. Assistance on this scale would suffice to raise our imports in the first half of 1943 to a total of 11 million tons.We recommend that for the present this latter figure should be accepted by departments as an operational assumption. On this assumption the arrange-ment outlined at paragraph 23 above would work out as follows (figures relateto the eighteen month period ending mid-1943) :- (Million tons.)Net ConsumptionAssumed       as estimated in import. paragraph 6.

Up to July 1942 it was reasonable to assume that the stocks of these remained constant in total. This assumptionis not, however, valid for the year July 1942-Juno 1943, and it has been necessary to makeNotes.allowance for a substantial fall in the overall stocks of these materials. This fall will not be reflected in the stock changes shown in future Lord Presidents Committee returns.The number of items involved is about 200.(a) Bince December 1941 scrap has not appeared in tho raw materials import programme and the changes in stocks havo not been related to imports.(b) Changes in consumers&apos; stocks are included.

United Kingdom (153,000 tons at June 30, 1942), which are included in the other columns.Note on Variations between -previous and present estimates.General. The rate of consumption of various materials has been reducedsince the date of the estimates made in the First Report in accordance with the directions of the War Cabinet, referred to in the present Report (paragraph 3 (e)).Steel. The level of steelworks and Ministry of Supply stocks has had to beraised owing to there being less flexibility. The proportion of ingots has beenreduced and there is increasing difficulty in getting certain types of steel fromChrome Ore. Imports are running considerably above the programme levelowing to the necessity of using this material for bottom cargo at certain loadingports. With stocks at their present level, a total cessation of loadings would reduce them to the figure given in the last column of the above table.Copper. The figure for the 30th June, 1943, is adjusted to our expectation of the maximum supplies likely to be made available to us by the U.S.A.Lead. About 15,000 tons of the stocks are antimonial lead not available forgeneral consumption.Cotton. ILK. stocks have been very greatly increased owing to heavy importsof Egyptian, and to a lesser extent, Indian cotton. These imports were madepartly in order to dispose of available shipping tonnage and partly in order to liftall possible supplies from Egypt, when invasion seemed imminent. Egyptianand. Indian cotton can only be used in partial substitution for U.S. cotton.Mining Timber. The higher level of stocks at the 30th June, 1943, nowshown, is due to the recently expanded programme of home production. Miningtimber does not figure in the import programme.Phosphate Rock. The additional 40,000 tons now estimated for the30th June, 1943, is due to the decision of the Lord Presidents Committee (39thMeeting) that super-phosphate plants should be kept in operation.October 28, 1942.
