I have consulted with my-colleagues,  the Home secretary and the Secretary of State for War, and we have agreed upon the document for circulation with regard to the question of theAmorican Negro Troops.      The document as so approved isAppendix A.2.      The Secretary of State for War and I have further considered the question of its circulation in the forces and make the following recommendations:(a) The document to be circulated as &quot;Private &amp; Confidential&quot;in the Army and Royal Air Force.      It is not considered necessary to circulate it in the Royal Navy or civil defence Services.      It should, however, &quot;be communicatedto such senior officers in these two latter service as may he liable to be asked questions on the point,since it is important that the same attitude should beadopted in all the Services .(b) In the Army the document should be circulated to allGeneral Officers and Brigadiers,  Colonels in command of Troops and Lieutenant,r- Colonels in Command of Units,and to all A.T.S.  officers of the rank of controller and above and Group Commanders.      In the R.A.P.  andW.A.A.F.   the distribution should be-to officers of equivalent rank and status,3.      We have further considered the article for publication byA.B.C.A.   and have passed it,  subject to minor alterations, asbeing in full accord with the policy of the document inAppendix A. &quot;4.      As the A.B.C.A.  publication will certainly come to thenotice of the Press and as it is almost certain that the documentin Appendix A will also sooner or later be got hold of by thePress, we consider that it would be wise for the Minister ofInformation to arrange a Press Conference at which the Secretaryof State for War and the Secretary of State for Air and I could put the matter before the Press with a request that they shouldnot &quot;feature&quot; the A.B.C.A. publication or make any reference tothe document in Appendix A.     We believe, subject to the opinionof the Minister of Informations,  that on the whole this will bethe best chance of avoiding bad publicity and indeed allpublicity which is what wo wish.(Intld.)

1 9JL.   %appendix a.Private &amp; ConfidentialUNITED ST;J2ES NEGRO TROOPSIN THE UNITKD KINGDOMThe coming of American negro troops to this country mayplace members of the Services in difficult situations owing tothe difference of outlook between the white American personnel and the British personnel as to the relationship between blackand white people.It has, therefore, been thought advisable to issue thefollowing instructions as to the advice which should be given toBritish Service personnel in this matter.1.      iunong the American troops in this country are a number of units whose personnel are negroes.      Their Officers are whitethough there are some negro Officers.      It is to be borne inmind that they contribute a valuable effort to the prosecution of the war by the provision of labour both skilled and unskilled.Their presence in England presents a new problem to Britishmen and women brought in contact with them,      They are Americancitizens and have equal rights with the white citizens.      Thereis no legal discrimination between the two, but the racialproblem is there and cannot be ignored (as explained inparagraphs 4 and 5 below).It is necessary,  therefore, for British men and women torecognise the problem and to take account of the attitude of thewhite American citizen.      This will prevent any straining of ouramicable relations with the U.S- Army through misunderstandingwhich knowledge and fore-thought can prevent.2.      British soldiers and auxiliaries should try to understand the American attitude to the relationships of white and coloured people, and to appreciate why it is different from the attitudeof most people in this country who normally come into contact with only an occasional Negro.They should recognise that difficult problems do arise whenpeople of different races live together - especially when their numbers do not differ greatly, and they are learning to live on terms of equal citizenship.      Thus they should also be aware ofthe difference of attitude among Americans themselves, accordingto whether they come from the Southern States of the Union, wherethe Negro population is about one-fourth of the total,  or fromthe North where Negro people are a very small minority.3.      The historical aspect must be understood in broad outline.The U.S.  comprises a vast area and the South is semi-tropicalwhere labour is more fitted to the coloured man. &quot;    To supply thislabour Africans were brought over in the seventeenth and eighteenthcenturies as slaves.      They took root and multiplied, workingmostly on cotton plantations.      In the American Civil War of1861-64 one of the issues was the aboiltion of slavery.      As aresult of this war the Negro became a free man and, though thebulk of them remained in the South,  they began to percolate intothe North.      The Negro population of the&quot; United States is nowover 13 millions, of whom 9 millions live in the Southern Statesand 4 millions in the North.

4.      In the South Negroes live apart from the white population,leading their own lives in their own way.      They have their ownchurches, schools and social gatherings.      They have their ownareas in towns and villages to live in.      In cars and buses theyhave seats allocated and their own. reservations in cinemas.In the South the white population still tend to regardNegroes as children for whom they have a moral responsibility;like children Negroes commonly inspire affection and admiration;but they are not considered &quot;equal&apos; to white men and women anymore than children are considered equal to adults, although an increasing number of them are now playing an active andinfluential part in the public life of communities in which theylive.It is a matter of deep conviction in the South that thewhite men and women should not intimately associate with theNegroes.5.      In the North,  the Negro does not work in massed labour inthe fields but more individually and his personal contact bringshim a greater political consciousness.      He tends to demand moreequal treatment and becomes more sensitive to racial distinction.His treatment in the North is freer and he is given greaterlatitude and is not segregated to the degree that he is in theSouth.      Nevertheless, his social life is not intimatelyconnected with that of the white man who does not normallyassociate with him in social gatherings.6.      The Americans are making a great experiment in working out a democratic way of life in a mixed community, with races of very different characteristics and traditions.      In doing so they have to take account of the legacy of the past and fears ofthe future.      It is a difficult task and it is not for us to embarrass them, even if we have- different views on how racerelationships should be treated in our own country and in theEmpire.    .7.      There is no reason why British soldiers and auxiliariesshould adopt the American attitude but they should respect itand avoid making it a subject for argument and dispute.      Theymust endeavour to understand the American point of view and theymust always be on their guard against giving offence.8.      There is certain practical advice which should be given asfollows:-(a) Be friendly and sympathetic towards coloured american troops - but remember that they are. not accustomedin their own country to close and intimate relation-ships with white people.(b) If you find yourselves in the company of white and coloured American troops  (as for example if whiteAmerican troops come into a canteen or bar where you are in the company of coloured Americans) makeit your business to avoid unpleasantness.      It is- much the best, however,&apos; to avoid such situations.

(c) Per a white woman to go about in the company ofa Negro American is likely to lead tocontroversy and ill-feeling, it may also hemisunderstood &quot;by the Negro troops themselves.This does not mean that friendly hospitalityin the home or in social gatherings need heruled out,  though in such cases care shouldhe taken not to invite white and colouredAmerican troops at the same time.Avoid arguments over the colour question;    hutif it happens to come up in discussions with american troops listen patiently to what the americans have to say and, without necessarilyagreeing with them, make up your mind that youwill not allow it to become an occasion forill-feeling or open dispute.Be on your guard against ill-disposed people whoare out to use the colour question as a meansof stirring up trouble between the americans and onrse1ve s.(f) It is probable that enemy propaganda will make every effort to use the colour question to stir up bad feeling between people in thiscountry and the coloured troops and betweenAmerican white and coloured troops.      Neverpass on a story which would tend to createdisaffection and do all you can to scotch suchrumours when they come to your notice.If your personnel have an;/- difficulties on this problem they should be told to- ask their Officer for advice.(e)
