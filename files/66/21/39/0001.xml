THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  February 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 59.February 2, 1942. /WAR CABINET.THE INDIAN POLITICAL SITUATION.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.I have read with interest the Memorandum by the Secretary of State forIndia (W.P. (42) 42) and the telegram from the Viceroy (W.P. (42) 43), but Iam unable to accept the conclusion that nothing can or should be done at thepresent time. This seems to me to result from a dangerous ignoring of the presentsituation.2. It is, I think, agreed, as pointed out in the Simon Report, that Indiahas been profoundly affected by the changed relationship between Europeans andAsiatics which began with the defeat of Russia by Japan at the beginning ofthe century. The hitherto axiomatic acceptance of the innate superiority of theEuropean over the Asiatic sustained a severe blow. The balance of prestige,always so important in the East, changed. The reverses which we and theAmericans are sustaining from the Japanese at the present time will continuethis process.3. The gallant resistance of the Chinese for more than four years againstthe same enemy makes the same way.4. The fact that we are now accepting Chinese aid in our war against theAxis Powers and are necessarily driven to a belated recognition of China as anequal and of Chinese as fellow fighters for civilisation against barbarism makesthe Indian ask why he, too, cannot be master in his own house.5. Similarly, the success against- the Axis of a semi-oriental people, theRussians, lends weight to the hypothesis that the East is now asserting itselfagainst the long dominance of the West.6. If the successful outcome of the war is recognised as due to theco-operation of the big four : Britain, the U.S.A., the U.S.S.R. and China, thetwo Asiatic Powers will claim a powerful voice in the settlement. A Pan-Asiaticmovement led by Japan has been recognised as a danger; a Pan-Asiatic bloc ofour Allies is a possibility that should not be ignored. Incidentally, Americansentiment has always lent strongly to the idea of Indian freedom.7. Tlhe- increasingly large contribution in blood and tears and sweat madeby Indians will not be forgotten and will be fully exploited by Indians who havenot themselves contributed.8. The Secretary of State thinks that we may weather the immediate stormby doing nothing; but what of subsequent storms 1 Such a hand-to-mouth policyis not statesmanship.9. After having tried to assist in dealing with the constitutional problemof India for some five or six years I have no temptation to ignore the complexitiesof the problem, complexities which are made harder, not easier, by the war, moreand not less urgent by the approach of the war to the confines of India.10. The Viceroy, in paragraph 14 of his telegram, points out that &apos;&apos; Indiaand Burma have no natural association with the Empire, from which they arealien by race, history and religion, and for which neither of them has any naturalaffection, and both are in the Empire because they are conquered countries which[23417]
have been brought there by force, kept there by our control, and which hithertoit has suited to remain under our protection.&quot; This is an astonishing statementto be made by a Viceroy. It sounds more like an extract from an anti-imperialistpropaganda speech. If it were true it would form the greatest possible con-demnatioh of our rule in India and would amply justify the action of everyextremist in India. But it is not the whole truth. All India was not the fruitsof conquest; large parts of it came under our rule to escape from tyranny andanarchy. The history of at least 150 years has forged close links between Indiaand the United Kingdom.It is one of the great achievements of our rule in India that, even if they donot entirely carry them out, educated Indians do accept British principles ofjustice and liberty. We are condemned by Indians not by the measure of Indianethical conceptions but by our own, which we have taught them to accept.It is precisely this acceptance by politically conscious Indians of theprinciples of democracy and liberty which puts us in the position of being ableto appeal to them to take part with us in the common struggle; but the successof this appeal and India&apos;s response does put upon us the obligation of seeingthat we, as far as we may, make them sharers in the things for which we and theyare fighting.I find, it quite impossible to accept and act on the crude imperialism of theViceroy, not only because I think it is wrong, but because I think it is fatallyshort-sighted and suicidal. I should certainly hot be prepared to cover up thisugliness with a cloak of pious sentiment about liberty and democracy.11. While I have little or no faith in the value of &quot; gestures,&quot; I do considerthat now is the time for an act of statesmanship.  To mark time is to lose India.12. A renewed effort must be made to get the leaders of the Indian politicalparties to unite. It is quite obvious from his telegram that the Viceroy is notthe man to do this. Indeed, his telegram goes far to explain his past failures.His mental attitude is expressed in paragraph 8 when he talks of regaining lostground after the war. He is obviously thinking in terms of making minor con-cessions while resting on the status quo.There are two practical alternatives : (a) To entrust some person of high standing either already in India or sentout from here with wide powers to negotiate a settlement in India; or(6) To bring representative Indians over here to discuss with us a settlement.The first alternative seems to me preferable, because Indians sent over here wouldbe in the position of delegates bound by their instructions and unable to abatea jot or tittle of their demands.I consider that the best chance of getting a settlement would be by themethod of private and informal meetings of a very few men.13. It would be necessary to give to our representative very wide powersboth as to the future and as to the present, though I consider that the demands forsteps to be taken now are likely to be far less important than demands for thepost-war period.14. There is precedent for such action. Lord Durham saved Canada to theBritish Empire. We need a man to do in India What Durham did in Canada.15. There is no virtue in delay or in mere dilatory action. In all probabilitythe time saved will be less than the duration of the war. Delay will only makethe problem harder.16. My conclusion therefore is that a representative with power to negotiatewithin wide limits should be sent to India now, either as a special envoy or inreplacement of the present Viceroy, and that a Cabinet Committee should beappointed to draw up terms of reference and powers.C. R. A.February 2, 1942.
