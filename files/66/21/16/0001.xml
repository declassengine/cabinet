o iCmDRAFT TELEGRAM.SECRETAddressed Ottowa   No.Wellington No.Capetown No.We have been thinking over the machinery for consult-ationi between ourselves and the other members of the BritishCommonwealth on matters of urgency connected with the war inthe light of the new position resulting from the United States,entry into the war and recent developments in the Pacific,   Wehave also received requests from the Australian Government forsome change in the existing system, more particularly expressingthe desire that &quot;accredited representative of the CommonwealthGovernment will have the right to be heard,in the War Cabinetin the formulation and the direction of policy&quot;.We are now informing the Commonwealth Government thatwe are prepared.to agree to this request and Sir Earle Page, whois at present in London as &quot;the special representative of theAustralian Cabinet, will attend meetings of the War Cabinethere for the purposes indicated.We feel that CanadaNew ZealandThe Union     o1&quot;^uJ * ^n^.; this, in casethey felt disposed to avaxx themselves of the new arrangementson a similar footing to. Australia.     I need not say that theywould be warmly welcomed.We have also considered whether any steps can be takento improve the machinery for consultation below the Ministeriallevel so as to ensure that every possible opportunity is givenfor such consultation at all stages*bof ore policy is finallysettled.With this in view we consider that, as regards Defencequestions, the best course would be that any Dominion Governmentwhich so desires should appoint a service liaison officer orofficers.to keep touch vrith the Chiefs of Staff organisationhere.     Such an arrangement would ensure that the Dominionrepresentative in London would be informed of any plans thatmight affect the Dominion at an early stage before finality isreached, so as to afford an opportunity for. the- expression ofDominion views while the matter is still in a formative stage.It would also be desirable that the officer or officers shouldbe of an appropriate rank, neither too junior nor too senior,and it is suggested that the level of Colonel or Lieutenant--Colonel in the Army would be the most suitable.You will no doubt inform us if you wish for rcpre-sentation of this kind.As regards Foreign Affairs, there&apos; is already machinerywhereby special Dominion officers appointed for the purpose canmake contact with the Foreign Office,     We are, however,examining the machine^ in the Foreign Office to see whether anyimprovements can be made to facilitate liaison of this kind,. iA separate communication as regards liaison in mattersof supply and production will be sent to you at a very earlydate.
