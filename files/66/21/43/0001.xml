C) c%Jjs DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS, BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT, )&quot;42)-63,ft February..  1948.COPY NO.-   WAR   CABINET..CONSIDERATION UNDER LEASE LEND,Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I circulate herewith, for the consideration of mycolleagues, a draft telegram to Washington on the linesrequested by the Cabinet on Monday last0Treasury, S0W01CDraft telegram to Viscount Halifax,Your telegram 5420&apos;The matter has again been very carefully consideredin.the light of the report which has been made to you and ofyour viev/s thereon,, and. we are appreciative of what the &apos;President has said in the message brought to you by AchesoruWe do not feel,&apos; however, that our , difficulties can be set aside.,2.      In our telegrams 6914 and 7234 we set out at lengththe reasons why we felt that it-would be inappropriate at thisstage to sign an agreement embodying Article VII0    We feltthen, and we feel now, that before signing the Agreement weought to know more clearly than we at present do,-what wouldbe the practical results following upon the Agreement.    Thiswould be necessary also to place us in a position to answerpoints of view which would be expressed in Parliament here andin the Dominions.   As you are aware we are concerned with thepossible effect of the Agreement upon both our general post-wareconomic position&apos;-and upon the question of Imperial Preference,,5,     This is, not to say that we dissent in any Way fromthe general economic policy underlying the Agreement (and ofcourse the Atlantic Charter) namely to promote mutuallyadvantageous economic relations and the betterment of world-wideeconomic conditions and, as was stated in our telegram 6914, weare ready to start conversations at an early date on theissue of economic relations between our two countries.,    We donot exclude from the discussions any of the matters fallingwithin the scope of Article VII0   At the same time we feelthat it would be inappropriate that we should sign an Agreementembodying an Article dealing with these matters until such&quot;discussions have taken place.
