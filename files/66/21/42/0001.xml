(5* 0     *-*230SECRET,3 /Copy NoW.P.(42) 62.February 4th, 1942.&quot;WAR     CABINETCONSIDERATION UNDER LEASE-LEND&quot;After discussion with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,I circulate to my colleagues herewith an alternative draftreply to Lord Halifax^ telegram No0 l   of January 29th, 1942(see W.M.(42) 14th Conclusions, Minute 8)cYour telegram No, k5  [of January 29th]The War Cabinet have very carefully reviewed the wholequestion in the light of what you say.     It is unnecessaryto restate the grounds on which His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave hitherto felt that some alternative other than thesignature of the Agreement in its present form is bothdesirable and practicable0     This does not, however, indicateany dissent from what appears to be the general economicpolicy underlying the Agreement (and, of course, theAtlantic Charter; and His Majesty1s Government are, of course,ready to confer with the United States Government on waysmost likely to lead to a movement towards giving that policyeffect,2*    Present wording of Article VII must inevitablyprovoke awkward questions in relation both to our generalpost-war economic difficulties and to Imperial Preference,to which satisfactory answers would be difficult on the basisof the, text of the Article as actually worded,,    Nevertheless,His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to give the fullest possibleweight to the arguments of the State Department, which youhave supported with so forcible an expression of your ownA.E.FOREIGN OFFICE,4th February, 19420Iapproval/
approval and His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise the advantageof endeavouring to reach a settlement of the issue, if thisis at all practicable.3,    The United States Government must be as concernedas His Majesty1&apos;s Government to ensure that if the Agreement &apos;were signed and came up for discussion in their respectiveParliaments, the Ministers in charge of the debates shouldgive as nearly similar explanations as possible as to whatthe parties conceived their obligations to be.    The mostpractical way of ensuring that all the Ministers concerned,said the same thing would be to arrange for an.exchange ofNotes simultaneous with the signature of the Agreement set-ting out an agreed interpretation of what Article &quot;VII means.The Notes would furnish Ministers in charge of debates witha common brief and provide the Governments concerned withdocuments suitable for laying as White Papers, if occasiondemanded.    My immediately following telegram containsdrafts of Notes which might be exchanged between the  .&quot;State Department and yourself.U*    You will observe that the suggested StateDepartments Note follows the line suggested in your telegramNo* 6106, but with some modification.5*     Please discuss the matter again with the StateDepartment on this basis.    Most of the features of thedraft Agreement, which at first sight seem to call formodification in drafting, result from its reciting the termsof the Lease-Lend Act.     Certain other passages, however,could be modified with a view to giving the instrument amore up-to-date appearance..   Subject to this being done and asatisfactory interpretative exchange of Notes being agreed to.His Majesty1s Government would be prepared to invite HisMajesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions to agree that theUnited Kingdom Government should sign the Agreement forthwith.,6,    See my immediately following telegram. .IIFollowing are texts of draft Notes suggested in myimmediately preceding telegram.(a)    Your Excellency,I have the honour to refer to the conversations whichhave taken place between representatives of the Governmentsof the United States and the United Kingdom of Great Britainand Northern Ireland in connexion with Article 7 of theLease-Lend Provisional Agreement signed this day.
3a2.    During the course of these conversationsrepresentatives of the United States have indicated thattheir Government fully appreciate the post-war problems whichwill confront the Governments of the United States and theUnited Kingdom, and of other countries which may subsequentlyparticipate in&apos; the&apos;&quot;agreedfaction for the&apos;attainment of theobjectives stated in the said Article 7*;.3. ,   The representatives of the United States Governmenthave referred to the special position of -the United Kingdomby reason of its dependence on international trade, and to theseverity of the problem of the balance of payments with whichthe Government&apos; of the United Kingdom will have to. deal in thepost-war&quot;&apos;period, and they have recognised .the necessity oftaking:this problem into account in formulating agreed actionto attain the ends of Article 7.4.    The representatives of the United Kingdom Governmenthave stated that they do not understand the worddiscrimination1 as applying to special arrangements betweenmembers of the same Commonwealth or Federation, such as theBritish Commonwealth or the United States of America and itsPossessions, and that before accepting any definite commitmentinvolving modification of the existing system of ImperialPreference, the Government of the United Kingdom wouldnaturally require to consult with the Governments of theDominions.5*    The representatives of the Government of the UnitedKingdom have referred to the problem which will- confront theUnited States Government in making adjustments&apos; in theproductive system of the United States in order that the UnitedStates may take their appropriate place in the system of worldtrade that the respective Governments are striving to attain^6.    The representatives of both contracting Governmentsrecognised that progress in the attainment of the objectsstated in Article J must be gradual, and that nothing inArticle 7 binds either contracting Government to take actionunilaterally without regard to action by the other, as may beagreed after discussion such as is contemplated under theabovementioned Article.7.     I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that itis the understanding of the Government of the United States,in signing the Agreement referred to above, that each of theContracting Governments, in concerting the measures necessaryfor the attainment in common aocord of the objectives envisagedin Article 7, will take fully into account the problems andconditions set forth in the preceding paragraphs.
