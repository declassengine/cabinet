This is not an excessive rate of income, especially if the generalincrease in living costs is taken into account.However j examples of earnings on the most gorgeous scale are not hard tofind. They can readily be discerned among newspapers.The earnings of the Daily Express are more than double the pre-war rate,although advertising revenue has dwindled.All the other newspapers disclose an earning position just as good or betterthan, the Daily Express.Here are some examples of company earnings, pre-war and now:-Last peace-time Last financialyear. year.Aerated Bread Co.   ...             179,415 258,605E.
