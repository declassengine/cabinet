We were appointed by the War Cabinet on the 10th November,1941 (W.M.(41) 110th Conclusions, Minute 2) &quot;To consider andreport on a scheme for post war credits for Service personnel andwhole time personnel of the civil defence services.&quot;2.        We have found it desirable to widen the scope of ourenquiries to include the question whether current improvements inpay and allowances should be granted in response to the demandsrecently made in the House of Commons and in the Press.Consideration of a post war credits scheme could not properly bedivorced from the background of current conditions and the demandfor current improvements.     The whole subject of Service pay andallowances was debated in the House of Commons on the 17th Deeembe1941;   the Lord Privy Seal then announced, in relation both tocurrent conditions and to the post war position of the Forces that&quot;All these matters will be carefully considered by a GovernmentCommittee, and when the House reassembles after the Recess weshall perhaps be able to bring forward our conclusions.&quot;We have accordingly covered the whole of this field in thisReport. &apos; -3.        We have kept in close consultation with the ServiceMinisters and the Minister of Pensions throughout.     They haveinformed us that the discussion in the House of Commons and thearticles which have appeared in the Press represent an agitationwhich in their&apos; view is not supported by any definite or strongfeeling in the Forces themselves.     We have nevertheless thoughtit wise - and the Service Ministers do not wish to dissent fromour conclusions - to recommend certain immediate improvements aswell as a scheme of post war credits;,   we have felt that there wasforce in the contention that the families of serving men are oftenat a disadvantage compared with the families of men in industryand that steps should be taken to give to the Services both someimmediate easements and some post war benefit comparable withthe repayable income tax being accumulated by industrial workers.We hope that if our recommendations are accepted they may beregarded as constituting a settlement of the whole difficult

question of Service pay and allowances, and that the Governmentas a whole will adopt this view and will firmly reject suchsuggestions as may be made in the House of Commons or elsewherefor still further concessions,he We have considered in detail all the suggestions putforward in Debate in the House of Commons and as a result wemake the following recommendations for immediate improvements: -(A) Compulsory Allotments to Dependants.Under present arrangements ;the Service man who claimsan allowance for a wife or other dependant is required to makea minimum allotment of 7s. a week from his own pay towards thedependant&apos;s support, and this compulsory allotment rises on asliding scale as pay increases.      It was represented in theDebate that these, compulsory allotments constitute a hardship tothe man with dependants.     The effect in the lowest paid gradesis that whereas a man without dependants has 17s0 per week(after payment of insurance) for his own expenditure-, the manwith family responsibilities has only 10sa     While it is .arguable that this disparity is no greater than that which isusual in civil life between the two classes of men, attentionhas been focussed on this particular point0We recommendsuggestion put forwardthat the Government should accept thein.the Debate that all compulsoryallotments should be reduced by 3s.6d. a week, th&apos;being made up to the dependant by the Exchequerof course, torli f f erenceThe realeffect of this adjustment is, of course, to increase the weeklyemoluments of all soldiers who claim family or depen^^ivsallowances by 3s.6d.     The individual will be able either to usethis addition for his own needs or if he so desires to give itas an additional voluntary allotment to his family.     It isestimated that some 50 per cent, of serving men will benefitsby this concession and the annual cost for the three ServicesMil be  17i? millions.(?) Children&apos;s Allowances,The ratesthe outbreak of warof children&apos;;have been asi allowances in forcefollows:-sinceFirst childSecond     &quot;Third      &quot;Fourth andsubsequentchildren.Pre-war Rate,5s.3s.2s.November&apos;5scUs,3s,Is..3o o?resen t^ rate(introduced inNovember, &quot;l&quot;9ljl,7se 6d.5s,6d.Us.-2-

It will be seen from this table that considerableimprovements have already been madee     After carefulconsideration both of the general merits of the case and ofthe dangers of &quot;wide repercussions arising from furtheradjustments we feel justified in recommending an increaseof l/- per week for all dependant children of men in theServices,,     The rates will thus become 8/6do for the firstchild, 6/6do for the second child, and 5/- for otherchildren8     The cost to the Exchequer of this improvementwill be of the order of  4g- millions per annum.(g)    Dependants[ Allowances,The present position of these allowances is that,subject to various conditions, of which the most importantis a test of means on the very limited basis introducedby the Determination of Needs Act, if a soldier contributedbefore he joined up between 9s0 and 15s. the dependantreceives 13s0 a week;    if between 15s., and 20s. thedependant receives 18s0 a week;    if over 20s. the dependantreceives 21s. 6d0 a weekc     In the case of a   &quot;lone1  depend-ant or a dependant living in a household withno otherincome, the dependant receives a special rate of 25s. ifthe contribution was at least 24s.     We recommend that theallowance in each of the first three ranges should beincreased by lsQ a week, at a cost to the Exchequer of some 500,000 a year.     It is realised that not to raise therate of   the &apos;lone? dependant may give rise to somecomplaint, but that rate is the same as the allowance andallotment to a soldier&apos;s wife and it does not seemreasonable to exceed the amount given to a wife for thecase of the &apos;loneT dependant,     A few exceptional cases ofhardship to &apos;loner dependants which were mentioned in theHouse of Commons can properly be dealt with under the&apos; WarService Grants Scheme05. We make no recommendation for an increase in basicpay of the Forces and indeed no demand in this respect wasnut forward in the.Hop.se of Commonsc     We do not recommendeither that any adjustment should be made in the presentalloyance paid tp a, wife,,which inclusive of, the compulsoryulietfilent from the husband-s pay I which has hitherto beenV/- ana which we recommend should now become 3/6d.) amountsto 25 So as a minimum0     We consider too., that the WarService Grants Scheme should continue to operate withoutfurther amendment.     The Scheme was very substantiallyimproved as receonly as October 1941 and little or nocriticism of it in its present form has been voiced in theHouse of Commons or elsewhere0     Indeed it seems to befairly generally admitted that the Scheme does effectivelywhat it sets out to do and ensures a reasonable standardto the families of members of the Forces both by referenceto absolute needs and to pre-Service income.6. There was little mention in the House of Commons ofthe position of officers, though one or two Memberssuggested improvements for the  junior, commissioned ranks*The position of officers has been reviewed within the lastfew months and certain improvements in the allowancespaid to the junior married officers have been agreed.      Itmust also be remembered that the officer class, to aconsiderable extent,  is shielded from the effect ofincreased taxation and the rising cost of food andaccommodation by provision in kind and by the freedom of   -allowances from income ta.r0-3-

4.8POST&quot;&quot;&quot;WAR CREDITS.7. The proposals made so far are designed to meet thecase made in favour of some alleviation of the position ofdependants.    We feel that the other question which wasraised in Debate - that of the post-war financialposition of.the serving man - is one on which real anxietymay be felt by some of the men.   We have thereforeexamined various methods of meeting this anxiety.8. It has been necessary, in considering the questionof post war benefits for the Forces, to take account of thepossibility of awarding a war gratuity on dischargesimilar to that which was given after the last war.    Aprovisional scheme for payment of such a gratuity to non-regulars was drawn up some years ago as a result ofdiscussion between Departments.   No announcement was made,however, and no decision has yet been taken to apply thatscheme to the present war.    The Service Ministers have madeit clear that the Services will press strongly for theapproval of a gratuity scheme on the lines of the onealready discussed, which provided for gratuities subjectto certain maxima amounting to 10 per cent, of the paydrawn by the individual during service.    It has beensuggested, therefore, that the demand for the provisionof a post-war nest egg for members of the Forces couldbe met by an immediate announcement that a gratuity schemehas been approved.9..        We feel that there are considerable disadvantagesin adopting this course.    It is doubtful whether, if agratuity scheme were announced, it would be possible towithhold an announcement of the basis on which gratuitieswould be calculated.    But it would be difficult, andperhaps dangerous at this stage of the war, to lay down thelines of a gratuity based on a percentage of pay drawn.What the percentage might reasonably be, and what maximawould be appropriate, must depend entirely on the lengthof the war, which is quite unforeseeable, and on ourfinancial condition at the end of it.    If the war shouldcontinue for a long time, the rate of 10 per cent, whichhas been suggested would produce an aggregate liabilitywhich would be extremely heavy and might be-quite out ofproportion to the resources available to meet it.10.       We have, therefore, thought it wiser to put forwardat this stage a different proposal, of a simple andstraightforward character, designed to    ensure that acertain minimum sum is being set aside on behalf of thesoldier in a way which compares with what is being done forthe industrial worker&apos;.    We recommend that a sum of 6d. perday of service, from the 1st April, 1942, should be creditedto all &quot;other ranks and ratings&quot; and made available to them,iSL manner analogous to the income tax credits, after thewar.    This represents a real and general betterment in theService conditions.of all other ranks, while avoiding thedangers of increased purchasing power which would resultfrom an all round increase in Service pay.    It will beimportant in announcing this scheme to make it clear thatit does not represent an increase in current pay which isbeing withheld (the Service Ministers advise that to putthe. matter in this way might cause discontent) but as abenefit deliberately designed to be given to the soldierafter the war to meet his needs at that time.    The amountof 6d, per day is a yardstick by which his entitlement willbe measured.

The Women&apos;s Forces should no doubt participate inthis scheme, the amount to be accumulated as post-warcredit being, as in the case of their basic pay and war pay,2/3rds of the men&apos;s rate - i0ec 4dQ a dayc11.       Under this proposal a sum of  9 per year of service( 6 in the case of women) will accumulate in favour of all, non-commissioned members of the Forces-,    While&apos;no reallyvalid comparison is possible with the amounts accumulatingin favour of industrial workers by way of deferred inoometax (since the amount of the latter varies widely, not onlyby reference to income, but also to family responsibilities)the -sums proposed for the Services compare favourably withthe repayable income tax of very large numbers ofindustrial workers,,IS.       We have, in accordance with our terms of reference,considered the position of full-?time Civil &quot;Defence WorkerseTheir remuneration l;as been determined by a comparison withmembers of the Fighting Services, and in those cases wherethere are children in the family no income tax credits willbe, accumulating in favour of Civil Defence Workers paidat&apos; the basic rates.   We rocommend, therefore, that inprinciple there should be an extension to Civil Defence ofthe post-war credit arrangement proposed for- the Forces^The application of this principle in detail requiresexamination between the Ministry of Home Security and theTreasury.[0: r&apos;:&apos;,&apos;- &quot;...      &apos;-&apos;&quot;&apos;-&quot;&apos;:.&apos;-: :&apos;&quot;&apos;-&apos;---. -&quot;if^/::;-The ,cost of this proposal for Forces of the presentsize amounts (including provisions for Civil DefenceWorkers) to more than  J5 i.iillionn .u r,.    it may beexpected to rise to perhaps  40 millions ppr- annum,13.       This proposal does not do away with the question ofa post-war gratuity for the Forces,, more particularlybecause it does not affect officers?    For the reasonsmentioned in Paragraph 5 above, we do not think that anycase is made out for an increase, in the pay of officers,&quot;whether current or deferred.    Moreover., the commissionedranks in general, despite the fact that a considerableproportion of Service - emoluments takes the form of tax-free allowances, are sufficiently highly paid to beaccumulating repayable income tax credits and thereforeare not in the same category in this matter as other ranks,.As regards, the post-war gratuity in general, we recognisethat the Services will not be willing to forgo the claim-that something of a similar nature to the gratuity paidafter- the last war should be paid again this time,.    Theannouncement of the post-war credit should therefore statethat the grant of, this credit would ^oc prejudice the case;;for a gratuity on appropriate lines014,       A number of details arise on the scheme for post-war credits.    We -p-cpo.^j that in general the credit shouldbe made availab&quot;1 J to -the men after discharge from theForces, special arrangements being made in connection withRegulars and to meet cases where the man is killed orinvalided out of the Service,,    The arrangements should bekept in line with those which are made for repayableincome tax and should involve the making available of thecredits in the form of a deposit in the Post Off-ice SavingsBank or in such o-ther manner as may be decided eventuallyin the case of income tax,

15f       If the scheme as a whole is approved.these detailscan appropriately he discussed between Departments witha view to an early announcement in the form of a WhitePaper,.&apos;16* Summary of Proposals.(1)   It is proposed that, compulsory allotments fromthe pay of members of the Forces claiming allowances forwives or other dependants should be reduced by 3s. 6d. perweek.    This has the effect of an increase.in pay of 6d. perday confined to men with dependants.(2)   It is proposed that all children&apos;s allowancesshould be increased by Is, per week.(3)   It is proposed that allowances to dependantsother than wives and children should be increased by Is.per week, with the exception of the case of the &quot;lone&quot;dependant already receiving 25s. per week.(4)   The Committee does not recommend any adjustmentsin basic pay in the wife&apos;s allowance, or in the pay orallowances of officers.    It is also considered that theWar Service Grants Scheme should continue in its presentform.(5)   It is proposed that an announcement should be mad*o.that a post-war nest egg will be provided for   other ranksand ratings&quot; by the crediting of 6d. per day of servicefrom the 1st April, 1942 to each individual, the creditto be made available to him after the war; and that thisproposal should not prejudice the case for a post-wargratuity on appropriate lines,(Intld. ) K.vr,(Chairman)Treasury Chambers,- Great George Street, s.W,1.17th .January^ 1942,,
