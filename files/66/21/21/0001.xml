There is reason to fear thatfarmers have interpreted this pledge as meaning that any substantial increasein production costs will be automatically compensated by increased pricesregardless of increased profits : and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisherieshas urged that the pledge requires the Government to advance prices to the fullextent of the increase in production costs which has occurred since the last generalreview of prices in the summer of 1940. According to his calculations the fullamount of this increase is  30-584 million; and he recommends that the prices-.of;:tiie- jnain^\agricultural -products..should be advanced by amounts designed,toyield that total figure in a full year on the estimated output for 1941-42.      : s;: &apos; 3,. The Lord Presidents Committee cannot accept an interpretation of thepledge which would imply that changes introduction costs must be reimbursiedregardless of changes in profits. In their view, the Government are entitled^under the terms of the pledge, to take account of receipts as well as costs.And, further, as the pledge is a continuing pledge, it is right that theGovernment should take into account changes in the general levels of costsand receipts throughout the whole period since it was given; and, in particular jcan take into consideration the question whether the increase in receiptswhich has resulted from the 1940 prices has, in fact, corresponded with theincrease which was expected to follow when those prices were fixed.4. In these circumstances the Committee think it right to draw attentionto the substantial increase in farmers&apos; profits since the beginning of the war.Table 1 in Appendix II of this memorandum gives particulars; prepared by theCentral Statistical Office, of farmers&apos; receipts, expenditure and net income duringthe four crop years from 1938 to 1942..;. During that period the net income offarmers from all sources rose from  59^ million in 1938-39 to  158 millionin 1940-41; and, but for the increased labour costs resulting from the recentwages award, would have risen to  182^ million in 1941-42. This means that;while the national income has risen during this period.by 35 per cent., and averageearnings in manufacturing industry by 42 per cent., farmers&apos; profits would have[23384] &quot; r
rWen by&quot; no less than 207 per cent, if it had not been for the&apos; recent swage increase.(&amp; account is taken of the wage increase; and it is assuinfed that there is no oorres-pdnding increase in prices^ the figure is 176 per cent, in a full crop year,) , Ifthe objection is made (as it is by the Minister of Agriculture) that wasa bad year for farmers; and thatitis unreasonable to take that as the: base yearfor, such a comparison, the point which has impressed my Committee can beillustrated equally well by a comparison between later years- for farmers,&apos;, netinc6me:/ppse: from  98^ million in 1939-40 to  158 million. m-1940-^41and to^^l/miliion, in 1941-42 (assuming for this purpose no change in the pricesand wages ruling in December 1941).5. In view of the general prosperity of the industry, my Committee feelthat, if the matter could be considered on its merits, there would be no case fora general increase in prices to offset increased costs. They believe that, if theindustry could be considered as a whole, the additional costs could be carriedby farmers out of the very substantially increased profits which have been made.There are, however, two further factors which have prevented the Committeefrom reaching this conclusion&apos;:- : (a) With the authority of the Lord President^ Committee, the pledge wasreaffirmed by the Minister of Agriculture and by the Secretary of State forScotland, at the time of and in specific relation to the application for a wageincrease which resulted in the raising of the national minimum wage to 60s.A report of the statement made by the Minister of Agricultureon that occasion isgiven in Appendix I of this memorandum. This statement clearly gaye rise tothe expectation that prices would be advanced &quot; to the extent of &quot; increased costsarising from the wages award; and my Committee feel that the GovernmentWould be open to a charge of bad faith if prices, were not how advanced by a totalamount related to the estimated cost of that award.(&amp;) A second consideration is that, although large numbers of farmers areclearly making substantial profits, the Agricultural Ministers contend that someWho are cultivating marginal land-largely in. response to the C:overiilhent&apos;spressure for increased food production-are making little more than a bareliving. &apos; &apos; ; &apos;v;yThe Agricultural Ministers have represented in the past that prices mustbe fixed at levels which are remunerative to farmers cultivating marginal land.This, means that farmers on the richer lands will make excessive profits : andalthough further attempts should, and will, be made to recover a larger proportionof these profits in taxation, it is well known that there are great administrativedifficulties in collecting Income Tax from the farming community, the great bulkof whom rarely keep accounts. ,      . ..; Efforts have been made in the past to find some means of recouping theadditional cost of cultivating marginal land otherwise than by prices, whichapply universally to all farms. These hitherto have proved unsuccessful; butpry Committee have asked the Departments to hold a further enquiry into thisquestion and have suggested that on this occasion they should enlist the assistanceof a small number of &quot;independent &quot;experts [e.g., agricultural economists) ofstanding.This enquiry cannot, however, be carried through before prices for 1941-42are fixed. And, in fixing these prices, it will be necessary to take some account ofthe position of the cultivator of marginal land who, it is claimed, has not earnedSuch profits as to be able, without assistance, to carry the additional costs whichhave arisen since prices were last fixed.6. The Committee have therefore reached the conclusion that, whileincreases in costs other than wages may be regarded as fully covered by! the risein farmers&apos; profits and in particular by the increased prices granted since thegeneral review of prices in 1940, it will be necessary, in view of the terms inwhich the pledge was reaffirmed in October 1941, td advance prices by an amountrepresenting the increased labour costs, in respect of controlled commodities,resulting from the recent increase of the national minimum wage to 60s..&apos; The Agricultural Departments have no data &quot;enabling them to make an exactapportionment of costs between controlled and uncontrolled commodities. It isnecessary, therefore, to rely upon an estimate of the increase in the wages bill,on controlled commodities only, resulting from the recent wages award.   The
best estimate which the&apos; Central Statistical Office can make is that the increasedcost in a full&quot;year may be about  20 million. . This estimate is based on, theassumptions : (a) that the wage rates of individual workers will ! rise prQrportionately to the increase in the minimum rate, and (b) that the increased costis to be calculated on the basis of the difference between 48s. and 60s. ci.7 The Minister of Agriculture is unwilling to accept price increasestotalling  20 million as sufficient either to fulfil the Government&apos;s pledge or&apos;toprovide the incentives required to secure the desired level of food production..The Secretary of State for Scotland is prepared to invite Scottish farmers&apos;/toaccept this figure of  20 million as fulfilling the pledge, though hie hopes thatsome means&quot; may be found for providing additional assistance for the cultivation!of marginal land. -&apos;!The members of my Committee, on the other hand, feel that an award of 20 million Would amply fulfil any reasonable interpretation of the pledge; andwould, in fact, represent a very generous decision, having regard to the generallevel of farmers&apos; profits over the past three years. Indeed, some members of theCommittee think  20 million too high a figure and would have preferred a totalof the order of  15 million or  16 million. Apart, however, from the Chancellorof the Exchequer (who has felt obliged to reserve his position) the majority of theCommittee were prepared to accept  20 million as the figure resulting from thecalculation made by the Central Statistical Office on what the Committee regardedas the most reasonable bases for computing the additional labour costs..8-. \ Whatever decision the War Cabinet may reach regarding the total amountof the;price increases to be awarded, my Committee think it essential that, whenthe decision is communicated to the farmers&apos; representatives, they should be madeclearly aware of the view taken by the Government on the various points broughtout in this memorandum, in particular-(a) The substantial profits made by farmers as a whole over the past three&quot; &apos;       years, full particulars of which should be disclosed to the farmers:;&quot; \;    &quot;    representatives. - . ;&apos; (b) The proper interpretation of the pledge. -.-(c) The objections to fixing prices by reference to the cost of marginaliproduction, and the intention of the Government to investigate furtherthe possibility of  devising alternative means  of recouping  theadditional cost of cultivating marginal land, otherwise than through-      prices which apply to all farms.(d) The fact that, if such alternative means were found, the existing price*     structure might have to be reviewed de novo.J.

History of the Pledge. &apos; &quot; &apos;I &apos; l. On the 14th December, 1939, the Agricultural policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment was stated in the House of Commons, by Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith,in the following terms : I &quot;. . . . While it is the producers&apos; job to produce, it is the Government&apos;sfi   job to see that conditions are created&apos;which will enable the producers to&apos;v   deliver the goods.   The Government recognise, therefore, that if the desiredincrease in home production is to be secured, a higher level of prices will be*    necessary for agricultural products generally.   Naturally we. must avoidextravagant or uncontrolled prices such as those which occurred in, the lastwar.   They not only occurred then, but eventually led to disaster for agri-&apos; &apos;   culture itself.  But given a level of prices which will provide a reasonable&apos; &apos; return to the farmers and enable them to pay a fair wage to the workers, wecan, I believe, if the weather permits and any Minister of Agriculture isallowed to put in that proviso get that 2,000,000 acres ploughed up.andrelieve the strain on our shipping by saving a very large tonnage of importsi    of food and feeding stuffs.  f; &apos; . . - - ,.X.2. The first assurance that prices would be subject to review in the event ofany substantial changes in costs of production appeared in the official announce-ment issued by the Agricultural Departments on the 30th August, 1940, andheaded &quot;Agricultural Prices for 1940-41.&quot; In this announcement were giventhe prices for the 1941 crops of wheat, feeding oats and feeding barley; a generalassurance about the prices which would be fixed in 1941 for the 1941 potatoes;the winter milk prices for 1940-41; and livestock prices for 1940-41. At theend of the announcement it was stated that-&quot;In the event of any substantial changes in costs of production theprices now announced will be subject to review, and in this connection theGovernment are considering the possibility of stabilising prices of some or&apos;.. all feeding-stuffs and fertilisers with a view to avoiding as far as practicablefrequent changes in price scales, and enabling farmers to plan ahead withgreater security.&apos;&apos;The text of this announcement was approved by the War Cabinet (W.M. (40)237th Conclusions, Minute 1, 29th August, 1940).3. On the 26th November, 1940, the Minister of Agriculture made a generalstatement in the House of Commons on Government agricultural policy. Thisincluded the following : &quot; The Government has, by ensuring a guaranteed market at guaranteedprices for the principal agricultural products for a year ahead, helped tocreate more stable conditions up to the 1941 harvest. The Government hasnow decided to go further and to guarantee that the present system of fixedprices and an assured market will be maintained for the duration of. hostilities and for at least one year thereafter. Prices will be subject toadjustment to the extent of my substantial changes in cost of production.&quot;The text of this statement was approved by the Food Policy Committee(F.P. (M.) (40) 37th Mtg., 22nd November, 1940) on the authority of the WarCabinet, who at their meeting on the 19th November, 1940 (W.M. (40) 291stConclusions, Minute 8) gave general approval to the recommendations of theFood Policy Committee as set out in W.P. (G) (40) 303, including the offer of aguarantee to the agricultural industry that the present system of fixed prices andan assured market would be maintained for the duration of the war and for atleast one year thereafter.
4. On the 26th September, 1941, there was a discussion at the LordPresidents Committee on the question of agricultural wages and prices as a resultof which it was resolved that  , &apos; &apos;\- . . . in dealing&apos;with the question of agricultural prices at the forth-coming deputation from the National Farmers&apos; Union, the Minister ofAgriculture should not make this an occasion for any special announcement.He should confine himself, so far as possible, to reassuring the deputationthat the pledge of the 26th November still stood, and stating that the questionof price increases would be dealt with on the basis that, if the AgriculturalWages Board awarded an increase in wages, the question of correspondingincreases in prices would have to be examined in detail.&quot; (L.P. (41) 45thMeeting, Minute 2.) &apos;&quot;5;.&apos; A statement was accordingly made on these lines by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries to the deputation from the National Farmers&apos; Unionwhich he received on the 8th October, 1941, and the official press notice on thedeputation contained the following: &quot; As regards wages and prices the Minister said that the Governmentadhered firmly to the undertaking given in November 1940 that&apos; Prices wouldbe subject to adjustment to the- extent of any substantial changes in costof production.&apos; If as a result of increases in wage rates such substantialchanges took place the question of appropriate price adjustments wouldcertainly arise and would be examined commodity by commodity.&quot;APPENDIX II.a 1.

The figures for the years 1938-39 to 1940-41 arebased on records of what has actually happened. The figures for the year 1941-42are based upon the assumptions that certain levels of output will be achieved andthat the level of prices and costs (including wage-rates) ruling at the beginningof December, 1941, will continue until the end of the crop year.,  %   - Table 1. &apos;--       ----^Income and Expenditure of Farmers in the United Kingdom.*(  million.)Years ending May 31st.

Receipts from&apos; Sales-of Controlled Commodities 1939-40-1941-2.The Government does not control the prices of all agricultural products;and the range of commodities which have come within the control system hasincreased as time has gone on. The following table shows the movement ofreceipts since the last general review of prices in June, 1940, from sales ofcommodities which were within the control system at that date. Since then, theranges of controlled commodities has widened and the percentage whichestimated receipts on sales of the commodities now controlled bear to estimatedtotal receipts in 1941-42 is 82 per cent, as compared with the 74 per cent, shownin the table for the narrower list.

(42) 9, Table III.3. Alternative Estimates of Increased Wage Costs.In the course of examining the question by how much prices should beincreased, various estimates of the cost of recent increases in wages have beenconsidered. The differences in these estimates arise from differences in theassumptions on which they are based. These differences fall into two groups,depending upon : (a) Different assumptions concerning the effect on the actual wage-rates of;different classes of workers of the increase in the minimum ivage.When the minimum rate changes, it is possible for the rates paid toworkers above the lowest grade to rise by the same absolute amount(i.e., if the minimum rises from 48s. to 60s. a worker at 60s. beforethe change would get^s. after) or they may rise proportionately (i.e.,,with a similar movement of the minimum, which is 25 per cent., theworker at 60s. would &quot;rise to 75s.).(b) Different assumptions concerning the average of rates above which costsare to be met. If all increases that have taken place since the lastgeneral adjustment are to be met, then the basic figureds 48s.; if onlysn the increases in the yearly wage bill; which are duetto the increasessince the beginning of December 1941, then the appropriate figure is&apos;50s. 10c?., which is the average which would have obtained for the year1941^42, had the increases since the beginning of December not takenplace.*The following table presents, the alternative estimates classified accordingto the assumptions explained above.  The estimate of the amount of the wages* It should be noted that this average for the year 1941-42 (assuming beginning of,December rates to be constant) is not the same as the average of December rates, which was52a. 7\&amp;; The average for the crop year takes into account a period when&apos; fch&amp; &quot;monthly-averagewas, lower.
