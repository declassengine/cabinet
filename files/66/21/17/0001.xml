MOST SECRET*Reference your M, No,3^7^ ,In view of the Commonwealth&apos;s vital interests inthe Par East and the naval, military and air forces employedthere, the Government is surprised that these changes shouldbe made without preliminary notification of the UnitedKingdom Government&apos;s intentions.It appears extraordinary,  after twelve monthscollaboration between the A.B.D, powers for perfecting jointplans and machinery, that there should be any weakness at thehighest level of all in inter-Governmental consultation.Quite frankly,, we consider it strange, on the faceof things, to make a change in command in the Par East atthis critical stage.     Brooke-Fopham is familiar with theprobable areas of operations and has visited the surrounding-countries and established contacts with the neighbouringauthorities.      The following cable has been despatched toAir Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham..&quot;The Commonwealth Government has learnt with verygreat regret that you are vacating the post of Commander-in-Chief Far East,We would like you to know that the Government andpeople of Australia are deeply indebted to you for theunsparing manner in .which you have devoted yourself tostrengthening the defences of the area commanded by you, theresults which you have achieved and the manner in which youhave collaborated with the Government of the adjacent partsof the Empire and other neighbouring countries.We have most pleasant and happy recollections ofyour visits to Australia and you might like to know that wehad the fullest confidence in you as Commander-in-Chief inso far as our own.forces were concerned.I would extend to you my personal good wishes forthe future.&quot;     Ends,$   This telegram informed the Australian Government ofthe appointment, of Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Pownallas C,-in-C.
