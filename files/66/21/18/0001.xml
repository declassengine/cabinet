Any proposals&apos;emanating either from the Supreme Commander or from any ofthe.

Addressed to the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs Uo* 450   Bepeated to the prime Minister of theCommonwealth of Australia Ho, 300Following for your prise Minis ter*   Begins0Thank you for your telegram No* 61 of 24th January,which I am afraid, however, etill leaves us perplexed m&amp;sto fee eandidg unconvinced,,   An immediate reflection0 if youwill allow S6 to say so? is that your telegram seems to havefee*n drafted primarily, if not solely, with reference to the -AoBoD*A. areai in particular(a)   provision is made for representations to the proposedFar Bast Council emanating from M the Supreme Commander or anyof the AeB,D.A. Governments&quot; s   We assume, however, (and wouldhe glad of confirmation) that this is inadvertent and thatdespite the fact that lew Zealand is not one of the a*b,d0a9powers9 the Hew Zealand Government would he entitled to maketheir representations to the Far East Council on all matterseoaeerning the pacific, including the A.B.D.A. areaB theAisae area and tee general pacific area..(fe)   You refer in paragraph T to the appointment of aBritish General to command the Pacific; the appointment isof coursee to the A.B.D.A. area (and it is incidentally worthyat note in this connection that the mmnt attack on Rabaulis outside that area).   We are much concerned with the A,B.D.A.areas with the- affairs of which we wish to keep closely in touch,(and should he able to do so by the proposal referred to inthe Secretary of statevs telegram Ho* 64) &quot;but we are mostintimately concerned first with the affaire in the Anzae areaand secondly with affairs in the remainder of the PacificIn this connection 1 asked you in my telegram of 20th Januaryto confirm our assumption that the functions of &quot;tee proposedPar Eastern Council would include the affairs in these twoareas as well as co-ordination &quot;between them inter se   aztdalso &quot;between each and &quot;both of them and the aTb7dTaT&quot;srea*On more fundamental aspects 1 must again expressthe unanimous opinion of ay colleagues and rayself that9 inview of the proposed assumption by the United States of fullresponsibility for naval defence of the Anaae and pacific areas,(as distinct from the A*b0DSA0 area), it is completely essentialthat we should have direct contact with the Americans0   Yourproposals/

proposals as explained do not meet this requirement *   indeedthey provide no direct contact at all between Hew; Zealand ;and the 0.8. A. and indirect contact contemplated throughthe fallowing successive stages? namely (a) the HewZealand Government notify their views to the Hew Zealasadrepresentative on the Far gas t Council who conveys /these&apos;&apos;views to (b) the Council Itself for discussion.   Co) TheChairman conveys the result of the discussion to (d) theJoint Staff Mission in Washington who, in turn, convey themfor discussion to (e) the combined Chiefs of Staff Committeewho, if agreed, finally transmit the conclusion to it) thepresident or the United states authorities concerned.We cannot regard this as adequate for ourpurposes - it would surely he cumbersome and there couldhe no certainty that our representations on any particularsubject would in this manner reach the American authoritieseither in time for the appropriate action or in the form whichwe should wish?I am hound to say that the proposals as presentedare not attractive -to us and that, if we were obliged tCAchoose between a Council as contemplated in London, withoutfully adequate American representation, and a similar Council&apos;&apos;ea^a1)iished&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;;la:!W&apos;amhiiigtont where American representation:could be assured, then, with all the disadvantages whichthat course would involve, we would be forced to prefer thesecond^alternative *put shortlys we think it not only desirable butnecessary that there should be one co-ordinating authority-land, sea and air - for the whole war against Japan on whichwe should wish to be represented^   while we do net declineto co-operate in the proposal you have outlined, with suchamendments as may be possible to meet our views, and will,If-necessary9 do our best to make it a success, we wouldnot willingly accept any solution of this admittedly most  .difficult problem that does not afford us direct and;continuous, access to the p^wer which, under the arrangementsso far proposed, is solely responsible for the conduct ofnaval operations in that portion of the world which includesthis Dominion.It may well be that amongst the many possiblesolutions - all open to some, and possibly grave, objaction -the best might perhaps be as follows%(a) Dominion membership of the United KingdomWar Cabinet - indeed, as this is in effect accorded toAustralia, we must ask for a similar privilege for HewZealand.(fe)    A Committee of that War. Cabinet to be chargedwith special supervision, in respect,of the BritishCommonwealth, of the war against Japan and with co-operationwith the body referred to In sub-paragraph (c) below; and(c)     A Far Eastern Council on lines suggested to beestablished&apos; in Washington with representation on Governmentalplane of the United States of America, United Kingdom,Australia^ Hew Zealand, China and the Netherlands.-1 am really very sorry to worry you like this,but, try as we may. w*s cannot see your proposal as a workablemethod of meeting the situation as we think it should, and hopeit ean9 be met,,      EndSo
