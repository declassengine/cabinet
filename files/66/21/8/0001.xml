(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP KIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).-SECRET. - y      COPY NO.^/119th January, .194-2...      WAR CABINET.SUPPLY OF TECHNICIANS.&apos; TO TURKEY.Memorandum &quot;by Minister, of Labour andNational Service.1,     On 24th July, 1941, the War Cabinet invited me to co-ordinate action inthe supply of a number of technicians required for. work under the TurkishGovernment, and upon further consideration of the matter on 11th August,&quot; 1941,they approved suggestions which I had made in Paper W.P,(4l)l88.2,     In the first place the requirements of the Turkish Government neededclarification,&apos;,and this has been secured in so far as the Turkish Dockyardconstruction programme is concerned, by the Admiralty sending AdmiralsJ,A, Davies and, G,; Morgan to examine the position on the spot.     The Turksrevised their programme, postponed their demands for. some 16 technicians andasked for the immediate supply of one Senior Officer for advisory work.This- officer has&apos; already taken up his appointment.     The following posts willneed to be filled within the next few months and the Admiralty have suitablemen available for the purpose:-1  Naval Store Officer. 1   Expense Accounts Officer13 Senior Workpeople of operative rank.5t.    The War Office have available two officers who are experts in thetesting of motor vehicles and the machinery used by military engineers.   TheTurks have now indicated that&apos;they do not require these officers&apos;.4;     The remaining Turkish demands have been modified from time to time and^they have cancelled a number of posts.for which suitable men had been madeavailable.     The present known demands for technicians in addition to thosementioned above,&apos;, together with the extent to which suitable men have alreadybeen found to fill them, are shown   in Appendix I.     In due course the;Turks .may.add to these demands. .;    &quot; . - -.I agree vfith the Foreign Office that it is a matter of first-classimportance - to find and send the technicians whom the Turks are ready toemploy, and with the least possible delay.    A note by the Foreign Officeupon the-subject,is attached (Appendix II).     I understand from theMinistry of Supply that there is a natural reluctance among industrialiststo assent to the departure of men who are of great value in British industry.The number of men still needed is however small and I have no doubt that itis right that the men should be found, &quot;: For political reasons it is hotpossible to advertise these posts in the normal way, but the Ministry of$HPPly has done its utmost to obtain suitable candidates for the posts which: still remain to be filled.     The question has already been before theWar Cabinet, and I suggest that the Minister of Supply should beauthorised to inform the heads of undertakings in which suitable volunteers , :can be found, that the War Cabinet regards the finding of the men as of thevery first importance,   &apos; This would increase the chances of success in Vrecruitment.E.B.

MOST SECRET.&apos; &apos; AEPBFDIX,.!!.:   .-  : -   . *&apos;. &quot; Technicians for Turkey.Memorandum by the Foreign. Office. .One. of the principal weaknesses of the Turkish war potential ia lack ofteohnicjalj&apos;persanhel&apos;;.atii&apos;&apos;;fche-&apos;Turkishauthorities..-hafire. on. various occasions askedus to help them in the matter.     The principal requests have, been: for steeloperatives - for the itarabuk iron and. steel works and munitions experts for the &apos;Turkish military factories, arsenals etc.2.   iThese two requests came up before the War Cabinet at the end of July ofthis year, and for the foil owing reasons a decision was reached . that a specialeffort should be made&apos; to provide these men j- .(a) The Germans-have made a great success ,of the policy of-infiltration In,Turkey, and there seemed every good reason to take&apos;&apos;a leaf out of thairbook.     If we had a large number of respected,British subjects usefullyemployed in important positions in Turkey at this critical period, . t&apos;would certainly increase cur&apos;inf luence and prestige&apos;in the countrygenerally. . :(b) The Turkish request for munitions experts, coming so soon after theconclusion of the Turoo-German agreement was particularly significantand tantamount to an invitation to forestall the Germans;   if we missed- this opportunity the Turks were bound to turn to the Germans.(c) By providing the men we - would be going far to ensure that&apos;-the Tu^rkswere able to supply themselves with certain of their own requirements ofwar material, e.g. ammunition for their guns, which are on a continentalpattern and the ammunition for which cannot be provided from British orAmerican sources. &apos;.&apos;^;Uyc^.:.&quot;&apos;(d) The German invasion of Russia made it incumbent onus to strengthen in&quot;every way our position in Turkey so as to be ready to counter Germanpressure which would certainly be exercised if and when the Germanarmies were to establish themselves in the Caucasus.5.     The reasons which led the War Gabinet to take their decision in July, 1941,are still valid in January, 1942.     There are, however, the following additionalreasons why speedy effect should be given to this&apos; decision.(i) There has been a large influx of Germans into Turkey since the conclusionof the Turco-German economic agreement in October in the guise ofeconomic experts, and tourists, and His Majestyfs Ambassador at Angorahas stated that the best means of countering&apos;! this is to despatch as soonas possible the men required by the Turkish Government.(ii) As a result of the investigations into Turkish war industry conductedby Major General Whitham, the following facts have emerged;-(a) The Karabuk Iron and Steel Works are vital to the Turkish warindustry and the maintenance and increase of production there is allimportant.     One of the principal obstacles to this is, however,lack of trained personnel.(b) The equipment of the Turkish military factories is extremely good butproduction is probably not sufficient to keep an army in the field.One of the principal difficulties is that there is no correlationbetween production and actual army requirements.     All this is mainlydue to deficiencies on the administrative and technical sides and canlargely be remedied by the provision of the experts for whom theTurkish Government asked.5o
(idi) Though Turkey, as a result of the German reverses in Russia, hasreceived a short respite, she may well he the next country in whichwe shall have to fight the Geionans. -   In coming to the assistanceof Turkey in accordance with&apos;iourohligations under the Treaty ofMutual Assistance, we shall probably confine ourselves to providingspecialised formations such as squadrons of bombers and fighters,leaving the brunt of the land defence to the Turkish infantry, whoseeffeotive support will be essential unless the safety of our ownspecialised formations is to be imperilled.    It is therefore verymuch in our own interest to see that the Turkish infantry is properlysupplied, and we are concentrating on this in our military suppliesto-Turkey.    At the same time the major part of supplier for theTurkish infantry will have to be provided by the Turkish factories,and it is therefore highly desirable that we should supply all thetechnical assistance possible.4.    Considerable progress has been made in discovering exactly what sort oftechnicians the Turks require and how they should be lent to the TurkishGovernment.    The latter have new definitely deoided on a number of postsfor which the Ministry of Supply, owing to calls elsewhere, have been, unableto find the full quota.    For: the reasons given above, the Foreign Office,urge that -the.highest priority be given to the release of the men.requiredfor the posts in question, and in view of the fact that an attack on. Turkeymay we^^^:-pilce.a*.\any. tiae^from&quot;March onwards, that the men. releasedshould be despatched^.:air to Turkey at the earliest opportunity^&apos;FOREIGN OFFICE,S.W.1.13th January, 1942,H.Q.59&amp;-70 A.La
