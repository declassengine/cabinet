THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 40.January 30, 1942.WAR CABINET.AGRICULTURAL WAGES AND COSTS.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.1. I dissent from the conclusions in the Lord Presidents MemorandumW.P. (42) 41.* 2. After Dunkirk, the Government called upon farmers for a supreme effortto secure the maximum food production possible within the resources of labour,machinery and fertilisers that could be made available.3. Such an effort called for drastic changes in farming practice and heavylong-term commitments.4.   Two things were necessary: -(1) Finance, i.e., to provide farmers with adequate finance to enable them tostart and carry through the long programme of work involved.(2) Confidence, i.e., to remove once and for all from their minds the fear thatthere would be a repetition of the disasters which followed the repealof the Corn Production Acts in 1921 after the last war.5. To meet No. (1), the three Agricultural Ministers (myself, Mr. ErnestBrown and Sir John Anderson) stated to our colleagues in June 1940 that, asMinisters responsible for carrying into effect the Governments food productionpolicy, we could not regard a costings basis as the sole criterion in fixing prices.We pointed out that &quot; the whole of the food production campaign rests, and mustrest, on the willingness of farmers, the great majority of whom are small men, toput forward the increased efforts demanded of them.....The crucial test ofprices is their reception by the farmers.&quot; This was accepted. Prices wereaccordingly fixed in respect of each of the major agricultural products at a leveldesigned to secure the maximum production possible and the new balance betweenthe different products which was required for war-time purposes.6. The Agricultural Ministers recognised that this would involve, manyfarmers making substantial profits. They suggested the remedy was increasedtaxation. This was accepted by our colleagues and by farmers as a corollary tothe new prices.7. To meet No. (2) it was decided in November 1940, after full considerationby the War Cabinet, to make a statement of Government and all-party policy inregard to agriculture which would cover not only the immediate future but, inso far as was constitutionally possible, the post-war period. The terms of thatstatement, which I made in the House of Commons on behalf of the Governmenton 26th November, 1940, are as follows : &quot;The Government has, by ensuring a guaranteed market at guaranteed. prices for the principal agricultural products for a year ahead, helped to:   create more stable conditions up to the 1941 harvest.  The Government has[23398]
now decided to go further and to guarantee that the present system of fixedprices and an assured market will be maintained for the duration ofhostilities and for at least one year thereafter. Prices will be subject toadjustment to the extent of any substantial changes in cost of production.Agricultural wages will continue to receive the protection afforded by theminima prescribed under the Agricultural Wages Acts .... The Govern-ment, representative as it is of all major political parties, recognises theimportance of maintaining after the war a healthy and well-balanced agricul-ture as an essential and permanent feature of national policy.&quot;8. The statement achieved its purposes. It inspired confidence in the agri-cultural community and, on the basis of the assurance which it contains, farmersachieved remarkable results in 1941. They would not, and indeed could not, haveproduced the food which they did produce in 1941 without the cash andconfidence provided by the complementary decisions taken in the summer andautumn of 1940.9. The policy statement of November 1940 was of a composite character.It contained general assurances with regard to war-time and post-war policy, anda clear and definite pledge that &quot;prices will be subject to adjustment to theextent of any substantial changes in cost of production.&quot; With the authority ofthe Lord Presidents Committee, the pledge, was specifically reaffirmed in October1941 in answer to an enquiry by the farmers in connection with the proposalbefore the Central Wages Board to raise the minimum agricultural wage to  3a week.10. The pledge has always been taken by the agricultural community, bymembers for county constituencies in Parliament, and by me, to mean preciselywhat it says. It was not until a few weeks ago, when the question of imp levmenting it first came up as a practical issue, that any interpretation other thanwhat I suggest is the obvious meaning of the words, was suggested even by themembers of the Lord Presidents Committee who now put forward the proposalsoutlined in the Lord Presidents Memorandum. As recently as September last,when I specifically warned the. Lord Presidents Committee/that a decision bythe Central Wages Board to raise the agricultural minimum wage would call forthe raising of agricultural prices under the pledge, no one then suggested theequivocal meaning which it is now sought to place on it, and I was authorised toreiterate it without qualification, which I did.1.1. It is now suggested that, on the basis of statistical calculations whichindicate a large increase in the global total of the profits of farmers taken as awhole, it is not really necessary to adjust prices at all, notwithstanding anadmitted increase in costs of production estimated at  30 million in the aggregate.&quot;It is recognised, however, that, in view of the fact that the pledge was reiteratedwithout qualification at the time when agricultural wages were under considera-tion, it would be difficult to avoid a charge of breach of faith if prices were notadvanced by an amount related to the estimated cost of the wage increase  20 million.12. I cannot accept the view of my colleagues on the Lord PresidentsCommittee that the increase of  20 million, which incidentally would mean thatthere would be no increase at all, or only an insignificant increase, in the prices ofcertain important commodities, would be a fulfilment of the Government pledge.13. Admittedly, farming taken as a whole is remunerative. But whateverdeductions may be drawn from global statistics about farmers&apos; profits taken asa whole, there are tens of thousands of farmers and smallholders to-day, particu-larly those in whose farming pigs and poultry occupied an important place beforethe war, who are still struggling to make both ends meet. These men have enteredinto commitments on the strength of the Governments pledge, and it is no answerto them to say that other farmers are making unnecessarily high profits.14. I believe a dangerously mistaken impression about the profits ofindividual farmers is given by looking at a global total of farming incomes. Iannex a table giving^ rough estimate of the distribution of incomes amongstdifferent groups of farmers, according to the size of their holdings. This presentsa very different picture from that: conveyed in Table I and paragraph 4 ofAppendix II of the Lord Presidents Memorandum (W.P. (42) 41)
15. The policy which the Government has adopted for preventing undulyhigh profits or incomes being retained by individuals in time of war is to levyappropriate taxation. The application of this principle was, as stated above,suggested by the Agricultural Ministers when putting forward their proposalsfor price increases in June 1940, and was accepted by my colleagues. The profitsof the larger farmers were then made subject to income tax under Schedule Dinstead of Schedule B, Farmers have throughout been subject to excess profitsduty. I am perfectly willing that this principle of taxing farmers&apos; profits shouldbe extended by whatever practicable and appropriate means can be devised. Theannexed table indicates that the result would be fruitful for the Chancellor.&apos; 16. The issue now before the War Cabinet is one which involves the good&apos;faith of the Government in regard not only to the particular pledge in questioh,but to the whole policy statement of which it forms a part. This is the first testof the Governments bond fides in regard to that statement. Failure to implementthe pledge in the sense in which it has been universally interpreted hitherto willthrow doubt on the value of the whole of the Governments declaration. Theconsequences will be deplorable from every point of view.17.   I certainly oould not answer for the effect on food production.R. S. H.Ministry of A griculture and Fisheries.January 30, 1942.
Rough Estimate of the Distribution by Size Groups of Farms of the CentralStatistical Office Net Income Figures for 1938-39 and 1940-41, for the.United Kingdom.1. The following approximate distribution has been made of the 1938-39and 1940-41 net income figures in Table 1 of Appendix II of the Lord President^memorandum (W.P. (42) 41) by reference to size group data obtained from theMinistry of Agriculture&apos;s Farm Management Survey. The Survey relates onlyto a sample of 2,000 farms in England and Wales. The distribution of sizegroups in this sample is not fully representative of England and Wales, and stillless representative of Scotland and Northern Ireland, which also enter into theCentral Statistical Office calculations. It is used here as the only figure availableshowing a distribution of incomes according to sizes of farms. The CentralStatistical Office agree that the method employed is the only one available andshould give approximately valid results.2. Other points that should be noted are (a) that the method of calculationmay have under-estimated the absolute increases going to the larger farmers, assome of the 1-50-acre holdings will be occupied by them in addition to theirlarge&quot;r-holdings; and (b) that, on the other hand, the larger size groups will bepaying back a large proportion of their profits in taxation.3.
