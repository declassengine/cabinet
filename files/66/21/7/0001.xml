The President would,I think, like to have the shipping and raw materials agreements made the subjectof an early announcement and this might possibly include general reference tomunition assignments. It was not intended to issue the actual texts as theycannot really be explained without reference to the personal factors involved, andit is only prudent to see how things go. This procedure and my unexpectedlyearly return enable comments to be made by the Cabinet. I promised thePresident to let him have a draft of the announcement, and I told him on thenight of Saturday, January 17, on the telephone, that I would do this in a dayor two, remembering always Napoleon&apos;s maxim that &quot; A constitution should beshort and obscure.&quot;January 19, 1942.[23355]
