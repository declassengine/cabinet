Printed for the War Cabinet, February, 1942SECRETW.P. (42) 656th February, 1942Copy Np.  31TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEYIt is requested that special care may be taken to ensure thesecrecy of this document.WAR CABINETAIR TRANSPORTMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARI strongly support the principle in para. 6(b) of W.P.(42) 40, that suitableaircraft should be diverted from operational duties to increase the air transportcapacity for the Near East and beyond. But I am not satisfied that therecommendation of the Committee is commensurate with real requirements.2. For some time past I have been disturbed at the serious consequences tothe Army overseas of the present deplorable state of air communications; thesehave completely failed to meet the needs of the Army, needs which have recentlyincreased and which will increase further as operations overseas become intensifiedand more widespread.3. I have had urgent representations made to me recently that theinadequacy v of Air Transport with the Middle East is the most important singlefactor at present affecting the morale of the Army in that theatre. Not only isthe Air Mail service of correspondence very irregular and insufficient, but whenthe planes arrive they carry only the airgraph letters which, for psychologicalreasons, are not universally popular with the troops. The few planes availablefor normal air mail correspondence mean that the accumulated mail often has togo by sea, with the consequent delays, though air mail postage rates have beenpaid. ,Again, the exigencies of war have meant that there are many soldiers whohave now been in the Middle East as long as five years, with no home leave.Under the stress of war conditions, such men are showing signs of strain. Weshould get a value quite disproportionate to the effort involved if we could bringa few such men home on leave by air, and the moral value of such a &quot; token &quot;service would be great.4. In addition, the Army urgently requires adequate air transport for manyother purposes, such as : (a) Officers proceeding overseas to take up important appointments.(b) The rapid interchange of liaison officers, both for planning and to ensurethe quick dissemination of lessons learnt in action and the rapidconsideration of improvements or changes in design of equipment.(c) Interchange of officers between Home and overseas theatres.(d) Urgent freight such as tank and gun spares, and ammunition.5. I estimate that the weekly requirements of the Army to meet suchdemands are: Passengers.........      2,500 lbs. (the   equivalent   of   10. passengers with 30 lbs.of extra baggage each.)Urgent freight   ......      ...      2,500 lbs.Total...5,000 lbs.
This estimate is based, however, on the assumption that a regular servicewill be maintained, which is impossible at. present with the small number of*aircraft employed, owing to the need for frequent servicing and delays caused byunavoidable mishaps.6. It is clear that if these needs are to be met, as well as those of otherGovernment departments, a very considerable increase in the number of aircraftemployed on air transport duties will be essential. I realise that these can beprovided only at the expense of the operations of the R.A.F., but I submit thatfull consideration should be given to the equally urgent operational requirementsof the Army.D.
