.  NAYAL SITUATION.General Review.1.   A Japanese and a German U-boat have been sunk.Heavy weather in the North Atlantic has caused damage to shipping and Ihas delayed convoys.                                                            &quot; ILarge numbers of U-boats have been operating off the East Coast of N^orth . 1America.Shipping losses due to enemy action have been moderate. I; &apos; &apos; &apos; : &apos;V &apos;  IHome Waters.2. A twin-engined Dornier bomber which attempted to attack an EastCoast convoy on the 17th was shot down by the escorting destroyer,H.M.S. Walpole, off Harwich.Three M.G.Bs. were in action with armed barges off Boulogne breakwater ion the night of the 16th/17th.   Two M.G.Bs. sustained superficial damage.Six M.T.Bs. and M.G.Bs. engaged two enemy trawlers off Cape Gris Nezduring the night of the 17th/18th and came under heavy fire. M.T.B. No. 47 ismissing and must be presumed lost, and M.T.B. No. 38 suffered damage andcasualties.H.M. Destroyer Broke was damaged by weather and lost two men overboardon the 15th, and on the 21st H.M. Corvette Montbretia went ashore at the entranceto Lough Strangford (south of Belfast).Heavy weather in the Atlantic and on the western coasts of the British Isleshas caused numerous Casualties to merchant&apos;vessels: Reports&apos;of serious damageand grounding have been received from 13 ships totalling over 64,000 tons, andof these 3 ships (13,635 tons) are a total loss. These casualties are additionalto those which occurred in Iceland (C) mentioned later in this Resume.Atlantic.3. The Italian s.s. Duchessa D&apos;Aosta (7,872 tons) was intercepted on the18th by H.M. Corvette Violet 230 miles S.W. of Lagos, and on the 21st the GermanLikomba (199 tons) and Bibundi (not registered at Lloyds) were intercepted inthe same locality.  All three ships were sent into Lagos!    &apos; &apos; &apos;The transport Llangibby Castle, in an outward-bound troop convoy, wastorpedoed about 600&apos; miles west 6f Bordeaux on the 16th &quot;aid subsequently wasbombed by Focke Wulf aircraft. Her steering gear was disabled, but she was ableto proceed and has arrived at, the Azores.    -Northern Waters.4. An outward convoy to Russia was twice attacked by U-boats on the 17thoff the Kola inlet. In the first attack a Russian minesweeper was sunk, and inthe second H.M. Destroyer Matabele and the s.s. Harmatris (5,395 tons) weretorpedoed. The Matabele is believed to have sunk very rapidly and it is fearedthat there are no survivors; the Harmatris was towed to harbour.The Russian icebreaker Stalin (4,866 tons) was slightly damaged by enemyaircraft at the entrance to the White Sea; repairs will take about three weeks.During a violent gale over Iceland (C),on the 15th the American cruiserWichita (8-inch guns) and five me1 rdhaht vessels totalling over 25,000 tons weredriven ashore. Damage was also caused to the boom at Hvalfiord and to controlledminefields.  The Wichita and three merchant vessels have now been refloated.       IMediterranean.5.   A convoy has arrived at Malta and a convoy from Malta has reachedAlexandria. 1H.M. Destroyer Ghurka, part of the escort of the Malta-bound convoy, wastorpedoed and sunk north of Mersa Matruh on the 17th. Six officers and fourratings are missing; the remainder of the crew were rescued by the Netherlands Idestroyer Isaac Sweers.
The Norwegian s.s. Thermopylae (6,655 tons) under British charter wasforced by defects to leave the Malta-bound convoy. While returning to Alexandriaon the 19th, in company with H.M.S. Carlisle and two destroyers, she was bombedby a single aircraft, set on fire, and later sank.  Destroyers took off 350 survivors,During the above operations H.M.S. Carlisle shot down a Ju. 88.H.M. Submarine Unbeaten sank a German U-boat on the 12th off the Straitsof Messina, and on the 19th attacked and probably sank a 7,000-ton tanker offTaormina.H.M. Submarine Triumph is overdue from patrol and must be considered lost;H.M. Destroyer Foxhound, was damaged in collision off Alexandria on thenight of the 16th/17th during a severe and unexpected gale.During the week 34,400 tons of French merchant shipping westbound and13,800 eastbound have passed through the Straits of Gibraltar under escort.Far East.Netherlands East Indies.6. A Japanese U-boat, probably the I. 65 (1,600 tons), was sunk byH.M. Destroyer Jupiter on the 17th in the Sunda Straits. After being depthcharged the U-boat surfaced 500 yards astern and engaged Jupiter with gunfire,obtaining one hit, which caused twelve casualties and put one gun out of action.The U-boat was finally sunk by depth charges.Coastal batteries sank two Japanese destroyers during the attack on Tarakan.Fifteen warships with thirty to forty transports were sighted by aircraft inthe south-west Celebes Sea on the 20th on a southerly course.Pacific Islands.7. H.M.S. Monowai (A.M.C.) was unsuccessfully attacked by a U-boat andone aircraft on the 16th off Suva, Fiji.. -Malaya.8. H.M. Destroyer Isis was damaged by a near-miss during an air raid onSingapore on the 17th.One of H.M. Ships bombarded Muar on the 18th.Philippines.9. An American official announcement states that American aircraft sanka Japanese cruiser and hit a tanker in the Sulu Sea on the 20th.Japan.10. It is officially stated that an American submarine has sunk threeJapanese merchant ships in Tokyo Bay. .Anti-Submarine Operations.11. In addition to the German and Japanese U-boats sunk by H.M. ShipsUnbeaten and Jupiter respectively, other surface attacks were made near CapeTrafalgar, off Halifax and south of Suva.There have been eight attacks by aircraft, three by American aircraft offBoston and one off New York, two by Canadian aircraft off St. John&apos;s. (Newfound-land) and Halifax, and two by British aircraft off the Butt of Lewis and theLibyan Coast.  In none of these attacks was there evidence of success.Enemy Intelligence.Germany.12. There has been a report of the Tirpitz at Trondheim, but this has notso far been confirmed by reconnaissance.J apan.13. There are indications of a. concentration of Japanese naval forces,including aircraft carriers and possibly battleships at Jaluit (in the south of theMarshall Islands).[23371] B
U-boats.&apos; . &apos;      . &apos;14. During the period there has been a concentration of U-boats off theNorth American Coast from Newfoundland to Virginia. Smaller groups havebeen working in the North-Western Approaches, in the vicinity of the Azores andoff the Murmansk Coast. Activity in the Mediterranean has continued. NoU-boats have been located in the South Atlantic.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.15. Five ships are known to have been lost during the period. U-boats sanktwo, a British tanker near Long Island, New York, and an American ship nearCape Hatteras, North Carolina. Six other attacks by U-boats have been reportedfrom the East American and Canadian Coast; in these attacks one ship was hitby torpedo and reached harbour, a. second was hit and abandoned but is stillafloat, a third was reported sinking and a fourth was on fire from shell fire.Aircraft sank a British ship in Tees Bay and a transport north of Tobruk.A Dutch ship was mined near Singapore.Protection of Seaborne Trade.16. During the week ending the 22nd January 883 ships, including 213Allied and 25 Neutral, were convoyed. Two cruisers, 5 anti-aircraft ships,3 armed merchant cruisers and ocean boarding vessels, 76 destroyers (including15 American destroyers) and 85 sloops, corvettes and minesweepers wereemployed on escort duties.Owing to delays caused by bad weather, imports into the United Kingdomby ships in convoy during the week ending/7th January were only 180,000 tons,compared with 682,000 tons during the previous seven days and an average of747,000 tons during the past ten weeks. Of the week&apos;s total imports, 41,000 tonswere oil of various grades.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.17. Aircraft were thought to be laying mines in the Bristol Channel onthe night of the 17th, and E-boats, which were engaged by our patrols, weresuspected of minelaying off Sheringham.Seventeen magnetic and two acoustic mines were destroyed during theweek. The mine totals now are : 1,744 magnetic, 1,228 acoustic and 1,068 contact.German and Italian Merchant Shipping.18. The ship which was beached at Vaagso during the raid on27th December and reported to be the Anhaus, of about 3,000 tons, is now saidto have been the German A nita L. M. Russ (1,712 tons).The German Barcelona (3,101 tons) has been sunk by the R.A.F. at Aalesund.The German Windhuk (16,662 tons) and the Ttalian Conte Grande (23,861tons), both at Santos, and the German Montevideo (6,075 tons), at Rio Grande doSul, have been taken over by the Brazilian authorities. The Windhuk wasdamaged by sabotage and is reported to have been beached, but was expected torefloat again with the rising of the tide. Several officers and men from this shipwere arrested.Yichy Merchant Shipping.The Mediterranean.19. Single ships, presumably belonging to the enemy, are reported to havebeen, arriving lately off Susa (Tunisia) at dawn and sailing south, perhaps forTripoli, at dusk. It is understood that the French authorities order them toanchor some four miles outside Susa.The Cephee (ex Francois L.D., 5,800 tons), which arrived at Casablancafrom Saigon with 7,000 tons of rubber at the end of October, passed Gibraltaron her way to Marseilles on the 10th January. The rubber is being shipped fromNorth African ports to France.
MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this Resumeas an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.Leningrad Sector.20. The Russians stated on 13th January that their troops had crossedthe River Volkhov at four points between Chudovo and Novgorod and that afurther advance would threaten the German positions round Leningrad. Thereis still no rail communication with Leningrad, but the town is being suppliedacross the ice of Lake Ladoga. -Central Sector.21. South of Lake Selinger the Russians have recaptured Ostashkov andSelisharovo.In the area north-west and south-west of Moscow the Russian pincermovement has made considerable progress. One arm advancing from the northhas reached the area south of Rzhev, almost encircling this town, and the othera line running from Yukhnov to a point south-west of Mosalsk and thence toKirov and Lyudinovo. Between the pincers, in the area west of Moscow, theRussians, state that a German force of 30 divisions is retiring and is beingheavily attacked from the air.Following strong Russian attacks, Mozhaisk was captured on 20th January.Ukraine.22. East of Oboyan German counter-attacks have met with some success.Further south the anticipated Russian attack against Kharkov and the line ofthe River Donetz has just begun. There is no change along the River Mius andthe Germans still hold Taganrog.The Russian supply situation in the Ukraine is reported to be difficult owingto the destruction of the railway bridges at Rostov some time ago by the Russians.Crimea.23. The Germans have been concentrating their main land and air effortagainst the Russian line covering the Kerch Peninsula and running norththrough Feodosia. The situation in this important area is confused, but it looksas if the Germans have made progress. German air forces have also beenattempting to prevent Russian reinforcements crossing the Kerch Straits.Conclusion.24. The Russian advances south-west of Rzhev and north of Bryansk areplacing the German forces west of Moscow in an increasingly difficult position.The cutting of the important lateral railway Rzhev-Vyasrna-Bryansk mayseriously affect German plans for stabilisation.If the Russians succeed in capturing Bryansk a contingency which is byno means improbable the Germans&apos; difficulties will be immeasurably increased,as rail communicationjbetween Smolensk and the Ukraine would be severed.25. Some seven to eight German divisions may have been withdrawnfrom Russia via Poland. There is, however, no indication of a larger movementaway from the Russian front as yet. Compensating movement from other areasseems so far likely to have kept the total of divisions on the Eastern Front aboutthe same.There are indications that Germany is trying to obtain promises of tlhefullest possible support from Hungary, Roumania and elsewhere with a view toa spring offensive against Russia.Libya.26. The principal event in the Western Desert during the past week hasbeen the capture of Half ava.[23371] . B 2
After the surrender of Bardia, the 2nd South African Division was disposedwith a view to reducing the Sollum-Halfaya position, and, as described in lastweek&apos;s Resume, Sollum village was captured on 12th January.Meanwhile, Halfaya had been heavily shelled and bombed over a period ofseveral days and preparations were in hand for a final assault, which was to becarried out by the South Africans and a Free French Brigade Group, recentlyarrived from Syria, supported by infantry tanks. The supply situation of thegarrison, which had to rely on stores dropped from the air at night, was known,to be precarious, but the position was a strong one and the enemy had plenty ofartillery.  Strong resistance was therefore expected.On 17th January, however, the garrison, numbering about 5,500, sur-rendered unconditionally before the main attack was launched. All the enemy&apos;sguns and stores were taken intact and 76 of our own prisoners were recovered.Over 2,000 of the prisoners captured were Germans.With the reduction of the last enemy centres of resistance in EasternCyrenaica, we have been relieved of the necessity for maintaining a large forcein the Frontier area. This will help to ease the administrative problem in themain theatre further west.27. In Western Cyrenaica enemy resistance has been strong all along thefront from Mersa Brega, east of El Agheila, to some 60 miles southward towardsMarada. His forces are being maintained through the numerous small ports onthe Gulf o&apos;f Sirte and by road from Tripoli.28. The port of Benghazi is now open but the unusually bad weather hasinterfered with unloading operations and also with traffic to the battle area.The Far East.Malaya.29. On 13th January, a force known as Westforce, was formed to hold adefensive line from Muar to Segamat in north-west Johore. This force consistedinitially of 27th A.I.F. Brigade and 45th Indian Brigade and was later joinedby part of 22nd A.I.F. Brigade and 9th Indian Division after reorganisation.On 14th January, 9th and 11th Indian Divisions passed throughWestforce, their withdrawal not being interfered with. The following daycontact was regained with the Japanese near Gemas, where considerable fightingdeveloped without the enemy gaining much ground.On 16th January the enemy crossed the River Muar near the west coastand at the same time small parties landed near Batu Pahat. Subsequent fightingin this area has been confused. On 20th January the 45th Indian InfantryBrigade, reinforced by two Australian battalions, was surrounded. The Japanesepenetrated further east and attacked the 53rd Infantry Brigade, which had beensent up from Singapore to reinforce this area. The next day the 45th IndianBrigade and the 53rd Infantry Brigade attacked east and west respectivelywith the object of joining up.In the Gemas area our troops have withdrawn south of the Segamat Riverto conform.On the east coast fighting has been confined to patrols.30. There are indications that air-borne troops-are being made ready inIndo-China for use against Malaya. rBurma.31. On 15th January, after considerable patrol activity, Japanese forcesadvanced on Mergui and Tavoy, and occupied the latter town. Our forces inboth these places are being withdrawn. The garrisons at Moulmein andKawkareik have been reinforced.It is estimated that the Japanese forces in Thailand include three infantrydivisions.Chinese forces have moved into Northern Burma.32. The labour situation in Rangoon.is serious and efforts are being madeto obtain help in this respect from China.
Butch Borneo. * -33. It is now known that the destruction of the oilfields at Tarakan wascompleted before the garrison surrendered.A strong attack on British forces in West Borneo near the Sarawak borderon 18th January has caused our withdrawal.Philippines.Mindanao.34. A Staff Officer from General Sharpe, commanding in Mindanao, hasconfirmed that the Japanese hold only a limited area round Davao Bay. Americanforces total two Visayan divisions (Philippine National Army).Luzon.35. The Japanese have made a number of unsuccessful attacks on theBataan Peninsula.   The food situation of the American forces is serious.Intelligence.France and Spain.36. Movements of German troops out of France continue. One divisionhas left the Amiens area for the Baltic States, and it is possible that anotherdivision may have left the Bordeaux area. Movement from, the East into Franceis less well authenticated, but it is possible that two divisions which arrived inBrittany during November and December 1941 came from Germany or Russia.The number of divisions in France is at present estimated to be twenty-three.Reports indicate that there are no German military or air concentrations inSouth-West France and no signs of any preparations for early German operationsagainst or through Spain.Balkan States.37.   It is believed that the number of German divisions in the Balkans is.now eleven or twelve, and some reports suggest that a further reduction in thetotal may be impending.AIR SITUATION.General Review.38.   Adverse weather conditions again seriously restricted our operationsagainst enemy targets on the Continent, shipping in Home Waters, and in Libya.Aerodromes in Sicily were successfully attacked.Enemy raids on Malta continued.Singapore Island was heavily bombed by enemy aircraft.United Kingdom.39. Fighter Command flew 793 sorties by day and 173 sorties by night. Ourfighters destroyed one enemy aircraft in daylight and another at night. Wehad no losses. Anti-aircraft gunfire destroyed two other raiders and a fifthcrashed after striking a balloon cable.40. Hostile activity remained at approximately the same scale as duringrecent weeks. A few single aircraft operated overland, mainly over the Easterncounties, but ho major raids took place.Germany and Occupied Territory.Night.41. Owing to bad weather, bombing operations were undertaken on fournights only.   Four hundred and twenty-three sorties were flown, compared with
616 in the previous week, and nearly 360 tons of H.E. bombs and 44,000incendiaries were released. The principal targets were Emden, Bremen andHamburg.42. Emden was attacked on four nights of the week by a total of 115aircraft, which dropped 150 tons of HE. bombs and 9,300 incendiaries. On twonights visibility was poor, but on the other two the town and docks were clearlyoutlined in the snow. The attacks were pressed home in the face of intense anti-aircraft fire. Several bursts were seen in the docks and town; incendiaries tooka firm hold, and many of the fires which were started were visible for somedistance on the return journey.Bremen was raided on two nights by a total of 73 aircraft, which dropped94 tons of H.E. bombs and 4,000 incendiaries. On the first night thick cloudprevented observation of results. On the second the weather was good, althoughthere was some ground haze. Among the bombs dropped were two of 4,000 lbs.,one of which fell close to a road and rail junction.Over 30 tons of H.E. bombs and 2,300 incendiaries were dropped on Hamburg.Visibility was fair and bombs were seen to burst in the town and docks and nearthe principal railway stations.Attacks on a lighter scale were made on the aerodromes at Soesterberg andSchipol in Holland. At Soesterberg a Wellington machine-gunned seven enemyaircraft, some airborne and some on the ground. At Schipol, fires were startedin hangars and buildings, and an enemy aircraft attempting to land was shotdown in flames.Day.43. Operations were considerably restricted by continued bad weather. Nodaylight operations were carried out by Bomber Command, and Fighter Commanddespatched 18 offensive sorties only.44. Three Beauforts of Coastal Command attacked St. Peter Port,Guernsey. Sheds on the jetty were hit by bombs, an A.A. gun was silenced andtroops were machine-gunned.45. A few small offensive operations were carried out by Spitfires. AtNieuport, barges, a bridge and a locomotive engine were hit, and casualties wereinflicted on enemy troops; at Verton, in the Pas de Calais, hits were made ona distillery, a factory and on a goods train; and at St. Valery an attack wasmade on army huts and troops.Coastal Operations.46. Coastal Command flew 148 patrols (218 sorties) and despatched20 additional sorties on convoy escorts. Shipping protection patrols by FighterCommand involved 563 sorties.47. A Hudson attacked a small vessel of 600-800 tons off the Dutch Coast.Four bombs fell about 15 yards from the vessel, which was also machine-gunned.A small armed vessel was attacked off Ijmuiden by a Beaufighter. The shipwas hit several times and when last seen was emitting clouds of smoke.Two Spitfires attacked with cannon and machine-gun fire a large flak shipoff the Dutch Coast.48.   Many photographic reconnaissances were flown.49. In the past week, enemy aircraft on the Western Front have been chieflyengaged in anti-shipping operations and weather reconnaissance.Shipping attacks were carried out off Middlesborough and in the Humber,and off Yarmouth, Harwich, and Lowestoft.F.W. 200s, which operated on five days of the week, made one attack inthe Atlantic, west of Bordeaux..
Mediterranean.Libya.50. In the frontier area, our aircraft carried out sustained attacks on theenemy defences at Halfaya until its surrender on the 17th;gun emplacements,dug outs and M.T. were effectively bombed.Operations in the forward area were severely curtailed by sandstorms andrain, and by the waterlogged condition of landing grounds south of Benghazi.Whenever weather permitted, our bombers and fighters continued to attack targetson and near the coastal roads, damaging a number of vehicles and causingcasualties among personnel.Aircraft from Malta, in very bad weather, carried out small scale&quot; nuisance &quot; raids against Tripoli (L) on four nights; hits were made in the town,harbour and seaplane base. Horns (L) was attacked in daylight and barrackswere hit.51. Enemy activity was slight. One aircraft caused Army casualties atCyrene and light attacks were made on Benghazi, Derna, Tocra, Barce, Apolloniaand on Antelat landing-ground. Two of our aircraft were damaged on theground, but no other damage has been reported.Malta.52. The island was frequently raided in daylight by waves of aircraft,and by single aircraft spread over long periods at night.The heaviest attacks took place on the 19th and 21st, when 70 bombers andfighters operated on each day. Takali and Hal Far aerodromes were stillunserviceable from previous bombing and later they became waterlogged. Theseconditions seriously hampered operations by our fighters, but a limited number ofsorties were flown from Luqa. The enemy appeared to direct their attacks mainlyagainst aerodromes. Bombs which fell on Takali aerodrome caused some furtherdamage and some casualties, and three of our fighters were destroyed on theground at Hal Far, Many of the attacks were, however, ineffective. Some civilianproperty was demolished, and a wharf at Grand Harbour was slightly damaged,but in general the damage reported was not severe.Sicily.53. Catania aerodrome was attacked on three nights, a total of 24 tons ofbombs being dropped. On the first occasion at least seven large fires were startedand on the second 20 fires from burning aircraft were observed, A Ju. 88 andpossibly others were destroyed while landing.The aerodrome at Comiso was attacked, by bomb-carrying Hurricanes, whichreported two fires from burning aircraft.Sea Communications.54. Naval aircraft from Malta attacked a merchant vessel and destroyeroff Melita and two hits were probably made on the former, which was stationarywhen last seen. Two probable hits were also claimed on a 2,000-ton vessel offthe Kerkennah Islands. An 8,000-ton tanker and one of its escorting destroyerswere attacked with torpedoes off Lampedusa and both vessels were hit and leftstationary.55. Our fighters provided shipping protection on several days. On oneoccasion four enemy aircraft attempting to interfere with a convoy weredamaged; we lost one Beaufighter.Russia.56. Enemy activity during the past week has been principally in thesouthern sectors of the front from Kharkov to the Crimea, but whenever theweather has been fit for flying, operations by the German Air Force have beeninterrupted by frequent .attacks on most of the aerodromes from which theirfighters and dive bomber units are operating.In the Moscow sector operations against :the advancing Russian troops andthe forward lines of communications have been very limited.
It is estimated that the Germans are now operating about 1,500 aircraft onthe Russian front as opposed to over 2,500 during the first weeks of the campaignin July, 1941.The Far Bast.Malaya.57, Our aircraft made many photographic reconnaissances of enemy-occupied aerodromes. They also reconnoitred the coasts of Malaya and towns andcommunications in Pahang and north Johore.58. Enemy ships and barges which were seen approaching Sungei Tengah(north-west of Malacca) were attacked by three Blenheims and six Hudsonsescorted by Buffaloes. At least four barges were sunk. Launches, barges andsampans in the Muar and Malacca areas were*also successfully attacked, resultingin several vessels being destroyed and in heavy casualties among the troops whichwere being carried in them.Bombing and machine-gun attacks were made on road and rail communica-tions, especially in the Gemas, Tampin and Muar areas. Many motor vehicleswere destroyed and others were damaged. rTwo attacks were made on the aerodrome at Kuala Lumpur and one on theaerodrome at Kuantan. At the latter, five enemy aircraft were destroyed and sixothers damaged on the ground. At Port Swettenham considerable damage wasdone to oil cisterns.59. Singapore Island was attacked on six days of the week by a total of520 aircraft. Four oil cisterns at the naval base were set on fire, but the dockyardwas only slightly damaged. The aerodromes on the Island were heavily attackedand six of our aircraft were destroyed on the ground and several others weredamaged. At Sembawang a hangar was destroyed; at Tengah the runway washit and buildings were burnt out, and at Seletar there were casualties and somedamage. A.A. defences claim to have shot down nine enemy aircraft, and ourfighters, including Hurricanes, destroyed in air combat 16 enemy aircraft,probably destroyed 10 and damaged 12.  We lost 11 fighters, but 4 pilots are safe.Our troops in the Segamat, Muar, Endau, and Mersing areas were heavilydive-bombed and machine-gunned, and our communications in the same areaswere bombed.  One enemy bomber was shot down.Burma.60. Several reconnaissances of the Myitta, Raheng, Mesod and Cheng-Maiareas were made by our aircraft. Two Buffaloes were shot down when returningfrom one of these flights.61. Six Blenheims escorted by American fighters assisted our ground forcesin an attack on Mesod. All their bombs fell in the target area, starting fires anddestroying two enemy aircraft on the ground. During another attack on Mesodan enemy bomber was shot down.  One of our fighters is missing.At Prachuab Kirikhund, our fighters seriously damaged with machine-gunfire seven enemy aircraft on the ground and also attacked an armoured train,killing the gun crews.62. The enemy made two attacks on Moulmein. Two hits were scored onthe aerodrome runway, and one of our aircraft on the ground was slightlydamaged.  There were some civilian casualties.Netherlands East Indies.63. The Allies&apos; air base at Amboina on the Island of Serang was raidedtwice during the week, on the first occasion by 26 bombers escorted by 12fighters and on the second by an unknown number of aircraft. The aerodromewas rendered temporarily unserviceable. One enemy aircraft was shot down.Two American Catalinas were destroyed on the water, and two Buffaloes of theNetherlands East Indies and one of our Hudsons were destroyed on the ground.Two waves of enemy aircraft escorted by. fighters attacked Pakanbaroe inSumatra (150 miles south-west of Singapore). Considerable damage was done tostores and workshops. Two civil aircraft on the ground were destroyed and otherswere damaged.
Pacific.64. Aircraft of the Royal Australian Air Force bombed the Eten, Dublonand Kapinga Marangi Islands in the Carolines. At Kapinga Marangi the jettywas hit and a flying boat on the water and1 several launches were destroyed.65. Rabaul and Lakunai aerodromes in New Britain were raided by enemyaircraft, but only slight damage was caused.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.66. On two occasions midday attacks were made on lighthouses in theShetlands. On the 18th at Skerries Lighthouse one woman was killed and onthe 21st at Fair Island two women were killed and a number of houses damaged.At the same time on the 21st bombs were dropped harmlessly into Loch Ewe.67. Midday on the 20th three people were killed by bombs at Spittal onthe south bank of the Tweed, and before and after dusk on the 15th a numberof places around Teeside were bombed.68.
