NAVAL SITUATION.1. A U-Boat has been sunk off the Azores. Snipping losses, which haveagain been mainly due to U-Boats&apos; attacks off the east coast of North America,have been considerable.  \ t .Shipping and transports have been heavily attacked by aircraft in theapproaches to Singapore.Home, Northern Waters and North Atlantic.2. During the night of the 3rd /4th February H.M. Destroyer Atherstflneand the Polish destroyer Kujawiak engaged two laden eastbound ships of theDutch &quot; schoot &quot; type about 3 miles north of Alderney and left them in a sinkingcondition.The American cutter A lewander Hamilton was torpedoed off Iceland (C) onthe 29th January, and H.M. Cutter Culver (ex-American) was torpedoed andsunk south-west of Cape Clear on the 31st. On the same day H.M. DestroyerBelmont (ex-American Town class) was torpedoed and sunk south ofNewfoundland while escorting an eastbound convoy.On the 24th January H.M. Minesweeper Britomart, at the entrance to theWhite Sea, was attacked and slightly damaged by a Ju. 88 which she subsequentlydestroyed; on the 1st February H.M. Destroyer Atherstone shot down a Ju. 88which was attacking a coastal convoy off Trevose Head, and on the same day aFocke-Wulf aircraft,, which was shadowing an outward-bound convoy in theNorth-West Approaches, was shot down by one of the escort, H.M. CorvetteGenista. On the following day a Dornier 217 was shot down during an attackby aircraft on our minesweepers off Cromer.H.M.S. Gambia, a new cruiser of the Fiji class, has been commissioned fortrials and service.Mediterranean.3. On the 24th January ELM. Submarine P. 36 torpedoed a merchant shipof about 5,000 tons off Tripoli. On the same day H.M. Submarine P. 34 torpedoeda ship of 7,000 tons in the Straits of Messina, and on the following day shetorpedoed another ship off Catania, Sicily.On the 1st February a convoy of 3 merchant vessels, westbound, escortedby three destroyers, was attacked by H.M. Submarine Urge off Cape Spartivento.A ship of 3,500 tons was hit and probably sunk.In the period under review a total of 24,000 tons of enemy shipping hasbeen destroyed or seriously damaged by our aircraft. Details are given under&quot; Air Situation.&quot;During the week 11,700 tons of French merchant shipping westbound and27,300 tons eastbound have passed the Straits of Gibraltar under escort.Far East.4. Aircraft of the American Pacific Fleet made a surprise attack on theJapanese in the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. Many enemy fleet auxiliaries weresunk and damaged, while naval ships heavily bombarded shore establishments.The British naval auxiliary vessels Larut (900 tons) and Raub (1,100 tons)were bombed and sunk off the east coast of Sumatra on the 22nd January.A troop convoy from India was dive-bombed in the approaches to Singapore;s.s. Empress of Asia (16,909 tons) was set on fire and abandoned. The personnel,except for bombing casualties, were saved. The s.s. City of Canterbury(8,331 tons)and s.s. Felix Roussel (17,083 tons) were slightly damaged.       &apos;The American Transport Royal T Frank was sunk by a U-boat 30 milesnorth of Hawaii on the 28th.In demolitions carried out in Singapore Dockyard, the large floating dockhas been sunk, and the power station, graving dock, pirmping machinery andcaissons have been put out of action.
Anti-Submarine Operations.: 5:. H.M. Destroyer Wesicott rammed and sank a U-boat (believed to beU. 581) south-east of Fayal (Azores) on the 2nd. Thirty-nine prisoners weretaken.The Dutch s.s. Aagtekeek claims to have rammed and possibly destroyed theU-boat which torpedoed the transport Llangibby Castle on the 16th January600 miles west of Bordeaux. H.M. Canadian Corvette Summerside made apromising attack on a U-boat in mid-Atlantic.In the Mediterranean two U-Boats were attacked and probably damaged byaircraft off the Libyan coast. In the Pacific the American submarine Gudgeonreported that she had sunk a Japanese U-boat about 220 miles west of MidwayIsland on the 26th January. Other attacks were carried out in the WesternAtlantic, off Iceland (C) and in the Western Approaches without definite results.Enemy Intelligence.German.6. The battlecruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and the cruiser PrinzEugen appear to be now ready for sea. Seven minesweepers and five torpedo-boats arrived at Brest between the 26th and 29th January from points on theFrench west coast.In the Baltic the pocket battleship A dmiral Scheer and cruisers are alsoready for sea.The battleship Tirpitz was still at Trondheim on the 4th February.ZJ-boats.7. The number and dispositions of U-boats operating in the North Atlanticshow little change.Japan. \8. The main fleet appears to be still in the Mandated Islands, possibly inthe area between Palao and Truk in the Caroline Group, and a force of cruisersand submarines is believed to be at Jaluit in the Marshall Group.Three aircraft-carriers have been operating in the New Guinea area and onthe 30th a force of three cruisers and six destroyers covered the landing atAmboina in the Netherlands East Indies.U-boats.9. It is probable that a flotilla is now based at Penang. U-boats have beenoperating off Madras and to the westward of Ceylon.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.10. During the week eleven ships have been reported torpedoed off theeastern seaboard of North America, and four ships have been attacked by U-boatsoff Ceylon and Madras.In attacks by enemy aircraft, one ship was sunk and four were seriouslydamaged in the approaches to Singapore; one was sunk off Falmouth and anotherwas damaged off Yarmouth. One ship was bombed and machine-gunned northof the Faroes.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ending the 4th February 815 ships, including 210Allied and 22 neutral, were convoyed. Four anti-aircraft ships, 73 destroyers(including 26 American destroyers), 103 sloops, corvettes and minesweepers wereemployed on escort duties.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the week ending31st January totalled 570,000 tons compared with 1,014,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 784,000 tons for the past ten weeks. Ofthe week&apos;s imports, 153,000 tons were oil of various grades.[23432] B
British Minelaying.12.   Mines were laid by surface craft in the East Coast Barrier, off theFrench Biscay coast and off the French Channel coast.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.13. Minelaying on a small scale was carried out by enemy aircraft in theBristol Channel area during, the night of the 31st/1st and by day on the 2ndoff the East coast.  ,The Germans have declared dangerous areas due to mines off Bergen, inMalangen Fjord in the Tromso area, and in the vicinity of the North Cape.They are also suspected of minelaying between the Lofoten Islands and theNorth Cape.Eighteen magnetic mines and two acoustic have been destroyed during theweek, fourteen of them in the Thames Approaches.The mine totals are : 1,776 magnetic mines, 1,230 acoustic and 1,068 contact.On the East Coast three minesweepers have been sunk and three damagedas the result of enemy air attacks : one capsized and sank while sweeping.Foreign Waters.14.   Australian aircraft reported sighting two moored mines on 27th Januaryin the Dundas Strait north of Port Darwin.German and Italian Merchant Shipping.The Black Sea and Mgean.15. The German s.s. Salzburg (1,756 tons) is reported to have arrived atSalonika on 26th January with prisoners of war, captured guns and damagedaeroplanes.The Italian Tanker Albaro (2,104 tons) arrived at Istanbul on 31st January,and sailed for Italy the next day, fully laden. The Italian s.s. Merano (3,705 tons)arrived at Istanbul from Trieste on 3rd February with a general cargo.The Atlantic.  &apos;16. The German s.s. Spreewald (5,083 tons) sent out an S.O.S. in bothGerman and English on 31st January, stating that she had been torpedoed andwas on fire 450 miles north of San Miguel in the Azores, and that she had Britishprisoners on board. Ships and aircraft sent to search have failed to locate, her.The Spreewaid had not been heard of since last August, when she was atYokohama.Yichy Merchant Shipping.Mediterranean.17. The s.s. St. Etienne (1,971 tons), which sailed from Marseilles on23rd January for Sfax, is believed to have taken on board a cargo of Fiat lorrieswhich had arrived by rail from Italy, and also provisions. This is believed tobe the first of four ships which will take supplies from Vichy France for the useof Axis forces in Libya.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this Resumeas an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.Lake Seliger sector.18. The Russians have made considerable progress in this sector, advancingoh both sides of Stara Russa, which is practically surrounded, and also in the areasouth of Kholm and south-west of Toropets.
Central sector, . .19. South-west of Zapadnaya Dvina a fresh advance toy the Russians hasbrought their forces forward to near Velizh, some 50 miles north-east of theimportant nodal point of Vitebsk. Meanwhile, Vyasma is being threatened frottithe east and the west, the Russians having succeeded in pushing at least weakdetachments from the north astride the main German line of withdrawal throughSmolensk. To the south-west of Moscow they, have advanced from the Yukhnovarea to within 20 miles of Vyasma. These pincer moves are significant in vie^rof a reliable report of the 28th January that the front ran roughly north andsouth just east of Gshatsk. . -Ukraine.20. North-east of Kursk German counter-attacks have managed to hold theRussian advance. On the Donets front the Russian counter-offensive continuesto make excellent progress. The area of penetration has been widened anddeepened and has probably reached a point about 40 miles from Dnepropetrovsk.There has been no change along the River Mius, Taganrog being still in Germanhands,Crimea.21. The German claim to have recaptured Feodosia is confirmed, and theline now runs across the narrowest part of the Kerch Isthmus, which the Russiansstill hold.Conclusions.22.   The main developments of the week have been :-(1) An extension of the Russian drive towards the important lateral railwayleading from Orsha towards Leningrad.(2) Further progress by both arms of the Russian pincer movement westof Moscow.(3) A considerable Russian advance in the Donets area.23. Perhaps the most important is the last, for, unless the situation in thissalient can be restored by counter-attacks, the Germans may be forced to withdrawto the Dnieper and abandon their front at Taganrog. This in turn might evenresult in the abandonment of the Crimea.Libya.24. It now appears that on the 27th January the 7th Indian InfantryBrigade, which was covering Benghazi, was attacked in flank and rear fromthe south-east by a strong tank column, which, as indicated in last week&apos;s Resume,had deployed from the enemy tank concentration at Msus. At the same time, thisbrigade was heavily attacked from the South by a strong force of Italian tanksand lorried infantry. Owing to the bad going, an attempt by our armouredforces, which had been withdrawn to Charruba, to intervene by a thrust towardsEl Abiar, had to be abandoned. Under these circumstances, the Benghazi positionwas virtually indefensible and the commander on the spot had no alternativebut to order a withdrawal.The enemy managed to place himself astride the line of retirement of the7th Indian Infantry Brigade, which was thus cut off from the remainder of the4th Indian Division in the Barce area. A quantity of equipment and a greatdeal of transport had to be abandoned and destroyed, but isolated columns whichincluded the majority of the personnel of the brigade and its attached artillerysucceeded in fighting their way out to the east.About 1,000 prisoners are believed to have been taken by the enemyduring the operations in the Benghazi area. The personnel and movableequipment, which had been assembled in connexion with the development of theport as a base, was evacuated over a period of several days before the enemyentered Benghazi.While the 4th Indian Division was withdrawing north-eastwards throughBarce, the remainder of our forward troops were disposed on a line covering[23432] b 2
Mekili and Bir. Tengeder to guard against an enemy attempt to exploit his successeastward from Msus. ,After the capture of Benghazi General Rommel seems to have divided hisarmoured forces into two parts. The 15th Panzer Division remained in the Msusarea, while the 21st Panzer Division and part of the 90th Light Division followedup the withdrawal of the 4th Indian Division.^ Throughout the withdrawal the rear guards of the 4th Indian Division wereheavily engaged, but by the 2nd February the division (less 7th Indian InfantryBrigade) had reached the Martuba area, on the right of the covering positionwhich the forward troops of the 13th Corps were then holding! By 4th Februarythe withdrawal to the line running south-eastward from Gazala, which the Corpsis now holding, was successfully completed.Far East.Malaya.25. During the night 30th/31st January our forces, with the exceptionof one Indian infantry brigade which had been cut off previously, were withdrawnto Singapore Island, and the Causeway breached. A large part of two otherbrigades, which had been isolated oh the West coast, was evacuated by the RoyalNavy.Since the withdrawal, land activity has been confined to artillery shelling ofenemy communications around Johore Bahru.At the beginning of the week the following reinforcements reachedSingapore : 18th Division (less one brigade which had already arrived).Reinforcements for 9th and 11th Indian Divisions.100th Light Tank Squadron (17 Light Tanks).5th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery, LA.Burma.26. On 30t)h January the enemy attacked our troops at Moulmein from alldirections. Heavy fighting occurred and owing to strong enemy pressure ourforces withdrew from Moulmein on 1st February after inflicting considerablecasualties. All mountain guns and ammunition and most equipment were safelyremoved. Our troops have now taken up defensive positions on the west bankof the River Salween.Reinforcements reaching Burma during the past week include an Indianinfantry brigade and a British battalion.Netherlands East Indies.27. On 30th January the Japanese landed in Amboina. CommunicationsWith the defending forces have been cut and no details of the fighting are known.28. The Japanese are presumed to have occupied Pontianak, the capitalof Dutch West Borneo. On the East Coast, the Japanese are advancing onSamarinda aerodrome, from which Allied aircraft have been withdrawn.Philippines.29. The situation remains virtually unchanged. Japanese attacks in Luzonhave been repulsed with heavy losses.Intelligence.Far East.30. On 27th January, shipping was sighted off Amoy. This may contain aJapanese division moved from Manchuria or North China. There are alsoindications that the transports, now present in CamranhBay and the MoluccaStraits may contain two further divisions, one from Formosa and one from thePhilippines.   One division has moved into Burma from Thailand (Siam) and
probably been replaced from Indo-China. It is reported that there are at leasttwo, but probably four, tank regiments in Malaya. 1 ?i;    Events of the past week have1 shewn-      &apos; &apos; /. (a) The gradual extension of enemy bases south and south-west in Borneoand the Celebes, making a. definite threat against the Malay Barrier; in... . (b) Continued enemy air operations south and south-east from the, BismarckArchipelago. The presence of shipping and naval escort at Rabaulsuggests that these activities may be preparatory to a further movefrom this area. &apos;   - &apos; ,.,(c) Definite indications that the enemy plan to occupy an aerodrome in thePalembang district of Sumatra. One Japanese division from Malayacould probably be made available for this operation. It is alsopossible that enemy airborne troops tentatively located in Indo-Chinamight be used for the purpose.Balkan States.31. Although there are fresh reports that Germany intends to attackTurkey in the Spring, such an operation appears to be highly unlikely. In viewof the circumstantial reports of continued German withdrawal from Yugoslavia,the estimate of the number of their divisions in that country is reduced from sixto four. It is believed that there are no German divisions in Roumania orBulgaria, although various non-divisional units still remain in these countries.AIR SITUATION.General Review.32. Offensive operations by the Metropolitan Air Force were considerablycurtailed owing to adverse weather. Enemy shipping was hit in attacks byCoastal Command aircraft.Successful attacks were made on enemy motor transport in Libya and onenemy merchant vessels in the Mediterranean. Enemy attacks on Malta havecontinued.In the Far East American heavy bombers sank two enemy transports anddestroyed nine fighters.Japanese aircraft attacked Sourabaya and adjacent aerodromes.United Kingdom.33.   Fighter Command flew 850 sorties by day and 113 by night.Enemy activity was again on a small scale and consisted mainly of coastaloperations. Only 8 aircraft crossed the coast by day and 5 by night.Germany and Occupied Territory.Night.34. Owing to adverse weather, Bomber Command were only able to carryout operations on two nights, 146 sorties being flown compared with 507 in theprevious week. One hundred and six tons of bombs were dropped.35. Heavy bombers were despatched to attack the Tirpitz at Trondheim,but owing to heavy cloud and severe icing, no aircraft succeeded in locating thetarget. ,   ,: ; 36. The warships at Brest were again attacked, 74 tons of bombs beingdropped. The usual smoke screen again obscured the targets, and the only resultsobserved were bursts in the dry dock area, in the town, and in the vicinity of thetorpedo station. On the same night, lighter scale attacks were made on thesubmarine base at St. Nazaireand the docks at Havre.
Day- .37. No operations were carried out by Bomber Command, and FighterCommand despatched only 13 offensive sorties. Four Spitfires attacked an alcoholdistillery at Courseulles-sur-Mer, and hit the main building, the tower and fourtanks, one of which blew up.Coastal Operations.38. Coastal Command flew 157 patrols (230 sorties) and 34 additional sortieson convoy escorts. Shipping/protection patrols by Fighter Command totalled 619sorties.39. A Beaufighter attacked with cannon fire two vessels, of 300 and700 tons respectively, off the Dutch Coast, inflicting considerable damage on bothships.40. A Hudson bombed from mast height a 900-ton vessel off Cuxhaven,and smoke was later seen rising from the stern. Another Hudson scored twohits on a coastal freighter of about 3,500 tons, 15 miles North of Ameland.Dense smoke from amidships was observed.41. A Beaufort attacked, from 50 feet, a 5,000-ton tanker North-West ofBrest . One hit was estimated. Later, three Beauforts carrying torpedoes weredespatched against this vessel, but only one aircraft attacked, and no results wereobserved.  Two of these Beauforts crashed in the sea.42. At night, Fighter Command despatched five Hurricane bombers toattack shipping off Gris Nez. Three ships were attacked, but all bombs fell short.43. Anti-shipping operations by the enemy were on a very small scale excepton one night when about 23 aircraft operated off the East Anglian Coast.Mediterranean.Libya.44. Our aircraft continued to make heavy attacks on enemy M.T. and groundforces,45. By night Wellingtons concentrated on the El Agheila-Jedabya-Benghazi area. During the first three nights of the week 81 tons of bombs weredropped, more than half this total being released on the night of 30th/31stJanuary, when every available aircraft operated. Subsequently the weatherdeteriorated and the scale of attack, was reduced.During these attacks dispersed M.T. and supply columns were constantlybombed and machine-gunned, and many fires and some violent explosions resultedfrom direct hits. A suspected tank maintenance and repair organisation was alsoattacked, and a large fire was started at Jedabya.46. Attacks on enemy communications in western Libya were carried outby Wellingtons based on Malta,. Motor transport on the road from Tripoli toBuerat El Hsun was bombed and machine-gunned with good effect, barrack blockswere damaged, and direct hits made on a -blockhouse south-west of Misurata.South of Tripoli (L) M.T. parks were successfully attacked, and on one occasiona series of fires developed into a conflagration. A large fire was also started inthe town. Attacks were also made on the harbour at Misurata and near misseswere observed in an attack on destroyers and light cruisers at Buerat El Hsun.A day attack by Blenheims on M.T. in this last locality resulted in damage to anumber of lorries.47. In the battle area fighters maintained protective sweeps over our forwardtroops but encountered no opposition from the enemy. Low level attacks werealso carried out against M.T. columns, and in the Benghazi area Hurricanesdestroyed or damaged eleven lorries and inflicted casualties on enemy troops.
Beaufighters attacked five barges at Ras El Aali (23 miles west-north-west ofEl Agheila); two of which were destroyed. During another raid on the samelocality they destroyed or overturned twelve M.T, vehicles and damaged! manyothers.48. On 3rd February Blenheims escorted by Kittyhawks made two attackson motorised units west of Derna and south-east of Apollonia. All bombs fellamong a large group of vehicles, six of which were destroyed by direct hits.Fighter aircraft also. caused many casualties among enemy personnel anddestroyed 12 vehicles including one petrol tanker. The attacks were continued onthe following day.49. Enemy activity during daylight was negligible, but one night attackon El Adem aerodrome resulted in four of our fighters and one Blenheim beingseriously damaged, and twelve other aircraft slightly damaged. A raid made onTobruk caused no damage.Malta.50. Enemy day and night attacks on Malta were continuous, the formerbeing more damaging and intense than those carried out by night.51. The heaviest night raid was on 2nd/3rd, when 20 enemy aircraftcrossed the coast. During this attack a Hurricane was destroyed on the groundat Hal Far and other aircraft and buildings sustained slight damage. Theslipway at Kalafrana was also seriously damaged and a Sunderland wasdestroyed.   One Ju. 88 was probably destroyed by A.A. fire.52. Enemy bombers on daylight raids were strongly escorted by fightersand their attacks continued to be directed towards neutralising the aerodromesat Kalafrana and Hal Far. The heaviest raid took place on the 4th, when31 bombers and 43 fighters crossed the coast. In this attack serious damage wascaused to buildings at Takali, and big craters made on the aerodrome. Three ofthe Hurricanes which intercepted these raiders are missing. Two Ju. 88s weredamaged. In other attacks the damage caused was not serious, many of the bombsfalling in the sea.The aerodromes at Hal Far and Takali remained water-logged andunserviceable.Italy and Sicily.53. On the night 2nd/3rd five Wellingtons dropped over six tons of bombsat Naples. Hits were made on the docks, on the marshalling yards and therepair base; detailed observation was obscured by an. effective smoke screen.Another Wellington dropped one 4,000-lb. bomb on the quay at Palermo.54. On three nights Hurricanes carried out offensive operations over Sicilianaerodromes and destroyed or seriously damaged two aircraft. They also damagedor destroyed a number of M.T. vehicles and machine-gunned a train.55. By day Blenheims bombed a goods train near Palermo and damaged arailway bridge.  Four of these aircraft failed to return.Sea Communications.56. Air reconnaissance in the Central Mediterranean resulted in thelocation of a number of enemy merchant vessels, which were subsequently success-fully attacked at night by naval torpedo aircraft operating under A.O.C., Malta.57. On the night 29th/30th, a merchant vessel of 6,000 tons, accompaniedby a destroyer, was attacked 74 miles N.N.W. of Tripoli (L). One, or possiblytwo hits were made, causing a violent explosion, and the vessel stopped and wasleft on fire. One Swordfish was shot down by A.A. fire.58. The following night a hit was made on a merchant vessel of 4,000 tonsnorth of Cape Bon, causing her to stop and list to port. Hits were also madeon another vessel of 8,000 tons which was attacked north of Zuara, and she waslater seen on fire with a heavy starboard list. Finally, on the night 2nd/3rd amerchant vessel of 6,000 tons was hit and went aground east of Ras Mahedia(50 miles north of Kerkenah Islands).
Russia. &apos;59. The Russian Air Force is maintaining a considerable effort in co-opera-tioh with their ground forces to the west of Moscow. Most of the effort isdirected to bombing roads by which the Germans are retreating. On these, con-gested troops and vehicles offer excellent targets, and there is evidence of theeffectiveness of the Russian air attack. Liaison between the infantry and AirForce is maintained by an air staff officer With each infantry divisional head-quarters, and air support is generally forthcoming in about an hour after it isasked for. High-level attacks on supply bases and aerodromes have been on anincreased scale both by day and by night. There is evidence that parachute troopshave been dropped in considerable numbers on the Central Front.60. On the Central Front, the week has been marked by a growth in Russianactivity by night and a corresponding decline in that of the German Air Force.In the daytime, particularly in the Mojaisk sector, German Air Force activityhas been negligible, enabling the Russians to ignore the dangers of massedmovement along the roads and thus to maintain the maximum of pressure alongthe whole front. v61. On the Southern Front, a series of violent snowstorms has restrictedflying on several days, resulting in a decline in activity by the German Air Force.The Far East.Burma.62. Our light bombers were primarily engaged against objectives in theMartaban area, where they inflicted considerable damage on villages and rivercraft. An enemy battery on an island off Martaban was also attacked, and,following upon reports of enemy landings, other islands to the East and Westof Martaban were bombed and machine-gunned.63. An attack was also made on Singora, where bursts were observed amongstore buildings and an M. T. Depot, and a number of fires were started.64. A total of about 35 enemy bombers with fighter escort attacked Touiigooaerodrome, where damage was done to the runway, a hangar and stores, andaircraft on the ground. Apart from these operations, enemy activity consistedof small-scale attacks against Martaban, Yinnyein, Mingaladon, Ayattuin,Rangoon, Zayatkwin and Thaton. The only damage reported occurred atMingaladon, where a civil wireless station was damaged.Malaya.65. Our fighters provided cover for the withdrawal of our ground forcesto Singapore Island, the operation being completed on the night of 30th/31st.Our offensive operations have been on a small scale, consisting of an attackby four American Fortresses on Kuantan aerodrome, where many fires werestarted, and two attacks on Kluang aerodrome, where bombs fell on the runwayand on the railway South of Kluang.66. The enemy has made about twenty attacks on Singapore Island duringthe week. The aerodrome at Seletar remains unserviceable, but only slight damageis reported at Sembawang and Kallang aerodromes. Elsewhere on the Islanddamage has been done to dock buildings, and several godowns have been set onfire, involving considerable damage to material. At Kranji Oil Depot, an oiltank was fired.   There were numerous casualties among the civilian population.67. During these attacks six enemy aircraft were destroyed by our fightersand eight by A.A. In addition seven were probably destroyed and a furtherfour were damaged.  Our losses were three fighters, of which one pilot is safe.Netherlands East Indies.68. American Fortresses and Liberators made four attacks on shipping atBalikpapan (East Borneo), and one attack on shipping near Kendari (South-EastCelebes). As a result of these attacks, two, and probably three, transports weresunk. In addition, the Fortresses shot down nine enemy fighters. One Fortresswas lost.
69. Enemy activity covered a wide area. In the Borneo area, attacks weremade on Samarinda, Pontianak, Bandjermasin and Kota Baru, In Sumatra,bombs were dropped at Emma Haven, Sabang and Balai. Amboina andWaingapoe (Sumbawa) were also attacked, Kota Baru was reported to be inflames, but elsewhere the only damage reported is the destruction of two Nether-lands East Indies Fighters.on the ground at Samarinda.70. On the 3rd, the enemy concentrated on the Sourabaya area. Sourabayaitself was attacked by 26 bombers with fighter escort and considerable damage wasdone to the town and three Catalinas on the water also destroyed. : Malangaerodrome (50 miles South of Sourabaya) was also attacked by 20 bombers andlater by eight fighters. The bombing caused little damage, but the fighter attackdestroyed or damaged four U.S. Fortresses, ten fighters and twelve Naval aircrafton the ground or on the water. Madiun aerodrome (55 miles west-sOuth-westof Sourabaya) was also attacked, resulting in damage to the erecting shop andten aircraft.Fighters and A.A. destroyed three enemy aircraft, and a further four wereprobably destroyed.Pacific Zone.71. A total of 19 R.A.A.F Catalinas made four attacks on Rabaul three onshipping in the harbour and one on Vanakunau aerodrome. Three vessels wereprobably hit, and near-misses obtained on another.72. Manus Island, Gizo (Solomon Islands), Salamoa (North-East NewGuinea), Wau, Tulagi (Solomon Islands) and Port Moresby (North-East NewGuinea) were all subjected to light-scale attacks from enemy aircraft. At PortMoresby, damage was caused to buildings and to the power and telephone systems.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.. 73. On four days and three nights during the week some bombs were droppedat scattered points on the East coasts of England and Scotland and in Cornwall.Damage was slight.Casualties.74. Estimated casualties for the week ending 0600 hours Wednesday, the4th February, are 15 killed (11 at Rosehearty in Aberdeenshire on the night of29th/30th January) and 4 seriously injured.[23432]c

APP&amp;NDtX Yli.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following report has been received during the past week from AirIntelligence sources: R.A.F. Raids on Southern Italy and Sicily.A number of reports testify to the cumulative moral effects of the R.A.F.offensive against Southern Italy and Sicily. Pessimism among the general publicwas reported even before the German withdrawal in Russia and the Britishadvance in Cyrenaica, and, according to a source who left Italy in early January,there were indications at that time that repeated raids might give rise to seriousincidents in Naples. In Sicily also considerable popular disturbance is said tohave been caused, which; according to one report, has resulted in a recrudescenceof separatist activity. A recent visit by the King of Italy to Sicily is said tohave been made the occasion for an open demonstration against the Government.Yet another informant, in a tribute to the standard of accuracy attained in theNeapolitan attacks, declares that the only resentment felt by the Italians iscaused by the failure of the British to hit the two hotels in which the Germanheadquarters in Naples are located. In Brindisi it is stated that the localauthorities have been forced by public opinion to press for more thorough defencemeasures.
