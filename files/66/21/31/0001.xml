THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 51.January 31, 1942. /WAR CABINET.THE ATTITUDE OF THE EIRE GOVERNMENT TOWARDS THEARRIVAL OF UNITED STATES FORCES IN NORTHERNIRELAND. (Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I circulate to the War Cabinet the text of a memorandum which the HighCommissioner for Eire handed to me on the 28th January. I understood fromhim that this represented a note which the Government in Dublin arecommunicating to the United States Government.C.Dominions Office,Downing Street, S.W. 1,January 31, 1942.Memorandum handed in by the High Commissioner for Eire on January 28, 1942.IN reply to the Press, Mr. de Valera stated to-day that the Irish Governmenthad not been consulted either by the British Government or the AmericanGovernment with regard to the coming of the American Troops to the SixCounties.Everyone knew, he said, that Ireland had 20 years ago been partitionedand the Six Counties cut off from the rest of the country by an Act of theBritish Parliament, despite the expressed will of the Irish people.When the United States was entering the last war President Wilson declaredthat America meant to fight for Democracy and for the rights of peoples tonational self-determination. The Irish people took him at his word and in theGeneral Elections of December 1918 by an overwhelming vote (more than threefor to one against) declared for national independence and for the establishmentof a Republic. This decision was reaffirmed after two years of conflict withBritain in the General Elections of 1921, when the Partition candidates returnedwere less than one-fourth of the total representation.Nevertheless, the British Government cut the nation in two and set up aseparate Parliament for six of the thirty-two counties. These six countiesformed no natural, historic or geographic entity. The area was chosen solelywith a view to securing a majority within it for the anti-national minority. Inone half of the area, including the city of Derry and the whole territory adjoiningthe boundary with tlhe twenty-six counties, a majority of the inhabitants areagainst partition.To partition the territory of an ancient nation is one of the cruellest wrongsthat can be committed against a people.   The partition of Ireland is in essencenot different from the former partition of Poland, nor are the evils that flowfrom it less in kind than those Abraham Lincoln foresaw from the projected[23402]
partition of the United States when he determined to prevent it even at thecost of fighting one of the bitterest civil wars in history.The people of Ireland have no feeling of hostility towards and no desireto be brought in any way into conflict with the United States. For reasons towhich he referred a few weeks ago, the contrary is the truth, but it is pur duty tomake it clearly understood that,-no matter what troops occupy the six counties,the Irish people&apos;s claim for the union of the whole of the national territory andfor supreme jurisdiction over it will remain unabated.Four years ago the British Government and Parliament recognised fully thesovereignty of the Irish Nation over that part of the national territory includedin the twenty-six counties and the bond has been honourably kept in that regard.But the maintenance of the partition of Ireland is as indefensible as aggressionsagainst small nations elsewhere which it is the avowed purpose of Great Britainand the United States in this way to bring to an end.(Signed)        J. W. DULANTY.January 27, 1942.
