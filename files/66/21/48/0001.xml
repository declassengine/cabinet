(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SEC RE TW.P.(42) 686th February. 1942,   &apos; COPY NO.WAR CABINETCIVIL DEFENCE SERVICES AND HOME GUARDMUTUAL ASSISTANCE ARRANGEMENTS&apos;Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister; of Home-Security and the Secretary of State, for -War,1.     The Cabinet will wish to know of an arrangement,recently concluded between the War Office and the&apos; HomeOffice and Ministry of Honie Security, whereby, on the - :one hand, a proportion of Civil Defence workers may jointhe Home. Guard and, on the other, Home Guards may performCivil Defence duties.   The outline of the scheme is asfollows2. (l) Part-time members of the various Civil DefenceServices other than the. Casualty Services proper(Ambulance and First Aid Posts) will in future beallowed, within the limits of Civil Defence requirements,to join the Home Guard in those areas where the HomeGuard is short of the necessary numbers.     They willdo so on the same footing as other Home Guards whosecivil occupations may still in the public interesthave to be performed after mustering has taken place:i.e, they will report to their local Commander within.48 hours of general mustering, when they will betold, according to the operational situation at thetime, whether to parade for duty or to continue theircivil employment for a further period.    In practice,the understanding will be that they will not becalled out unless fighting breaks out in the vicinity.They will receive training in the use of\arms and willbe provided with Home Guard uniform to be worn with aCivil Defence armlet when on Civil Defence duty.    Ifthey already have a Civil Defence uniform those partswhich are not common to both will be called in.(2)    If any members of the Civil Defence Services ingeneral can be dispensed with outright now they will bereleased forthwith and retain no Civil Defence liability.(3)    It is unlikely that many members can be sparedfrom the Fire Service, but a certain number of part-timemembers of that Service may similarly be allowed to jointhe Home Guard and be provided wi h Home Guard uniform.(4)    Special Constables who can be spared will bereleased at once and will retain no police liability.3,     Members of the Home Guard will receive generaltraining in such Civil Defence tesks as may he required of, them and military commanders will be instructed to make theassistance of the Home Guard available to the Civil DefenceServices under normal present day conditions as well asduring and after heavy raids.    The extent to which the -present state of Home Guard training will enable this to be/done
done varies from one place to another, &quot;but, inrgepn^j^Jthey will co-operate to the fullest possible &quot;extent&quot;andin particular will ensure that, subject to the requirementsof military duty and training, Home Guards will, wherenecessary,. be available to undertake fire guard duties as aHome Guard duty.   Members will act as units under theirown commanders.  .4.  . These arrangements apply to the Civil Defence Servicesin general in Scotland.    We understand that the Secretaryof State for Scotland proposes to make similar arrange-ments in respect of the National Fire Service, the FireGuards and Special Constables.     As in England, andWales, however, it is/unlikely that many members of, theFire Service can be spared and in certain areas the.&apos;  .,&apos;limited arrangement proposed for Special Constables,&apos;under which they are to be released how if at all, mayhave to be applied also to the Eire Guards..5.     The Home Secretary proposes to announce- the newscheme in the House of Commons on 19th February in answerto an arranged question.H.
