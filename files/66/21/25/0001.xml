I circulate herewith Part I of the Second Report of the Beveridgo Committeeon Skilled Men in the Services.2S     The Beveridge Committee was appointed on the 9th June, &quot;194*1 with thefollowing terms of references-&quot;To examine in consultation with the three Service Departments, the usenow made in the Royal Navys the Army and the Royal Air Force ofskilled men and to advice in the light of the operational andmaintenance commitments of the three Services;-(a) whether the skilled man-power already at the disposal of the   &quot;Services is being used with due economy and effect?(b) whether the Service arrangements for training skilled men aresuch as to meet to the greatest practicable extent theService requirements for skilled menJ(o) whether the demands of the Services for skilled men as recruitsto Service trades during the period ending 3&quot;Ist March, 1942,should in any respect be modified&quot;*3*     The Committee made an Interim Report on the 30th July, 1941*     This waspublished in August (Cmd*6307)*4*     Part I of the Second Report of the Committee was made on the31st October, 1941*     The Report, while laying emphasis on the vitalimportance of securing the repairs and maintenance of machines . of war inaction and of the provision of skilled men needed for this purpose, givesreasons for believing that the use of the skilled men already in theServices could be improved, particularly in the Army, where the Committeeconsider there is a continuing large scale waste of engineers,.     The Reportstresses the urgent importance of increasing the skilled men available forvarious branches of the mechanised army, and suggests that the men required canbe found largely but not wholly through changes in the Army organisation andbetter use of existing personnel, and that the obtaining of the additionalnumbers required from industry depends upon re-assuring the public as to thesteps taken by the Army to make full use of the men already in it.     The Reportgoes on to make suggestions as to review of establishments, pooling ofmechanical resources, de-skilling of repairs, trade testing and trainings,5* In brief, the Report gives the following answers to the three questions intheir terms of reference.(a) T/hether the skilled man power already at the disposal of theServices is being; used with due economy and effect.The answer for the Navy is &quot;yes&quot;j   for the Army &quot;not yet&quot;j   for theAir Force &quot;not yet wholly&quot;.(b) Tfhether the Service, arrangements for the Training of Skilled Men aresuch as to meet to the greatest -practicable extent the Servicerequirements for skilled men. -     *For all three Services the answer to this question is &quot;yes&quot;, subject tominor improvements such as are continually being made by the Service Departmentsthemselves * 1oCOPY NO. 3 /
(c) Whether the demands of the Services for skilled men as recruitsto Service trades during the period ending ^tstjforohj, 1942*shoved in any respect be modified,&apos; &apos;As Regards the Navy 10^ of: the demands up to the 31st March, 1942 shouldbe met by better use of some of, the naval reservists.    As regards the Armythe revised requirements can be more than met from -within the Army itself,   .While that possibility remains there is ho case for supplying additionalnumbers of skilled men to the Army, from industry, though the need to recruita oer-^in number of highly skilled men as   artificers may be established..As regards the Air Force the position is dealt&apos;with in Part, II of the Report,^which is.a secret docuraent not intended for publication?6*    Since Part I of the Report was made last October it has been underconsideration by the Service Departments j in particular by the War Office,Delay in publication is causing criticism and giving rise to questions inthe House each week,     I would, therefore^ press for immediate publicationof this part of the Report.E.B.k Circulated to the Lord Presidents Committee, as LaP3(41 )211 *HwQ,924-70 A.L.2*

SECOND REPORT.  -CHAIRMAN^ gUMfJARY OP SECOND REPORT.A, The Committee on Skilled Men in the Services have conducted an audit of theuse made by each of the Services of men of engineering and allied occupations      .&apos;&apos;(including electricians and sheet metal workers) by examining individual menfrom lists submitted by employers and trade unions, and classifying them in accordwith the degree to which their skill is used or not used in their present serviceposition (paras,. 5-6&quot;)*    Detailed records of 169 men interviewed by the Committee-..&quot;at Headquarters are given in Appendix A to the Report.     187 other men have been ...interviewed on behalf of the Committee at Army Stations (para. 10).    A reporton these station interviews is given in Appendix B,B, The audit shows some failure in all three Services to make full use of theengineering skill already at their disposal in spite of the efforts of theServices to secure this (paras, 7-14).     The trade unions have made.out theircase (para. 15).     But the extent of the failure varies greatly between theServices and between different parts of the Army,     In considering this resultand the measures required, regard must be had to the.attitude of the men (para, 18),C, In the Navy, failure to use men according to their skill is rare and isconfined to naval reservists oalled up in their previous naval occupations, andnot remustered in trades appropriate, to. their civilian slcill (paras. 12-14),In general the arrangements of the Navy for discovering engineering talent,trade testing, technical training, review of establishments, interim use ofengineers while waiting to take up their posts., and self-scrutiny are excellent(paras. 19-25).D, &apos; In the Army, the problem of securing full use of slcill is much harder thanin the other Services (para.   27).     Failure to use the available engineering slcillis substantial in all the Corps examined and is very large in some of the Corps,More than half the soldiers seen at Headquarters were placed by the Committee     -.in their Class VI as men whose engineering slcill was not being used, while less &apos;than a third were in Classes I - III as being well or sufficiently used or inprocess of transfer to good use (paras, 9 and 29).     The Headquarters Interviewsrepresented a selection biassed in the direction of finding misfits.     Butthe Station Interviews, representing so far as possible a fair   sample of themen of engineering and allied occupations gave results differing only in degree,not kind.; of all the men seen at Stations nearly two fifths were placed inClass VI and the same proportion in Classes I - III.   &apos; Talcing the Corpsseparately, of those seen, at the Stations in the Royal Engineers more thantwo thirds, of those in the Royal Army Service Corps and the Royal Corps ofSignals more than one third, of those in the Royal Artillery nearly a quarterwere placed in Class VI (paras, 10 and 29).     About half of the men placed inClass VI by the Committee are mustered in service trades appropriate to theircivilian slcill, but are not working at those trades (Class VI a), and the otherhalf are not mustered in a Service trade corresponding to their slcili^or arenot mustered in any trade at all (Class VI b) (paras. 1 and 30),     The&quot;reservoir of unused engineering skill in the Army, if it could be made availablefor that purpose is probably more than large enough to meet the revised     &quot;. -&apos;     . -requirements submitted by the War Office, with the possible exception ofarmament artificers (paras. 30 and 46-475&quot;E, Before more men of engineering skill are taicen from industry for the Army,steps should be taicen to ensure full use of the men already available.     Thesesteps includeExpert review of Army establishments (para. 3l).Pooling of mechanical resources between Corps and units (para. 33).Selection of men for Service trades by expert interviews rather thanon paper forms (paras. 40^-41).&quot;Removal of many barriers to transfer (para, 39).Improvements of posting, trade testing and technical training (paras, 36-38).1.
The practicability of these and other steps may be found to depend upon largerchanges of organisation, including enlistment of men&quot; fp  the Army rather-thanfor particular Corps and the -setting. up of a Corps of Mechanical Engineers(paras. 42-45). - &quot; ;- &apos; ,&quot; -   &apos; &apos; &quot;. .       ^P.    The Committee&apos;s enquiries are less complete for. the Air -Force&apos; than for theother Services.    &quot;In general the arrangements made by the Air Force for recruitinand training technical personnel are excellent/arid the-larger workshops showa high degree of dilution of skilled men by traineea (paras. 48-49).   But theaudit has shown an appreciable number of cases-of failure ,to use skill fullyelsewhere.     These cases point to the heed:for a-careful review of technicalestablishments at operational and training stations, for re^examination of    .methods of selection and trade testing and for talcing further steps to removebarriers oh remustering according to skill, including restrictions uponremustering of men how engaged on ground defence (paras. 50-52).G. The Committee repeat the emphasis laid in their Interim Report upon thevital importance of keeping the machines.of war..in action;   this purpose;has aclaim of first priority upon what ever may be needed to&apos; secure it; (para, 55).Though some part of the needs of the Services for skilled men for this purposecan in all three Services be met by transfer.within the Services, they cannot   -be met.wholly in,this way.     Some further withdrawal of skilled men from industryis inevitable and will mean a loss of production unless withdrawal can be madegood by substitution or more effective use of labour in industry (paras. 60-6i);,H. Substitution of less skilbd men and womenfor skilled men in industry,depends upon substitutes being available.     The demands already made by the&apos;.. 1Services and by the munitions industries are approaching the limits of. the -available man-power of all kinds.     There is needed a scrutiny of. the -use. of &apos;   &apos;all man-power in the Services whether of men or of women and not of skilled men::only (para. 62). &apos; -- ,  &apos;I. Maintenance of machines of war in action needs not man.only but sparevpartg;.an adequate provision .of spare parts, by enabling repair in the&quot;&apos;field to take y &apos;,the form of replacement, is both essential in itself&apos; and a means&apos;;.o.f,economising&apos;-&quot;.&apos;&apos;,demands for skilled engineers (paras, 56 and 32),. &apos;   - .       ,J.     Engineers whose rare slcill cannot be used ir  her- Services should be releasedto industry;. in war, engineers are for those who can;.use them as engineers for&quot;a national purpose, (paras. 57-58)* S&apos; ^K.     Discussion of. the actual requirements of the Services, involving&apos; use- of &apos; -.extremely confidential figures, is reserved for Part ll of the Report., now In -.- -preparation.     The part now presented leds (para, 63) to the conclusions:.- -;(a) that Navy demands in so far as they.may bo approved statistically will, need&apos;: &quot;,to be met as to 9C$ from industry and as to 10/, by better use of naval,-. &quot;-;&apos;/&apos;^reservists.;  &apos; ,.&apos; &apos;.&apos;-.(b) that, apart &quot;from the possible exception, of armament artificers, Army demands:can probably be-met in full, by better.&apos;use of men in - the Service;; ,,(c) that the demands of the Mr Force can be met to ,some extent by better use- of.men in the Service, but how much can be met. in this way depends on mattersreserved for Part II and, upon further enquiry. ^L. - At the request &quot;of the Service Departments the * Committee .are continuing to&quot;&apos;.invite the eo-operation of associations of employers and workpeople1 in securinggood use - of skilled engineers, by furnishing lists, of&apos; such men, in the Forces withparticulars from which their skill can be judged.and the best&apos;use made of them &apos;(para, 16). -. ,-&apos;&apos;&apos;,&apos;.&apos;(intd.)

m i - SECOND REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON, SKILLED MEW&quot; , &quot;        .: IN. THE - SERVICES, VTo the Rt. Hon. Ernest Beyin, M.P., ...&quot;- -.Minister of Labour and National Service.&apos;.Sir, ^ ; &apos;&apos;   ^        ^ ;   r I1*&quot; - Terms, of Reference;   We. were, appointed by you on.the 9th June last as aCommittee instructed to &quot;examine;in consultation with the three ServiOev .Departments, the use&quot; now made in the Royal Navy, the Army and theRoyal Air Force of skilled men and to- advise in the light of the operationaland maintenance commitments of the three.Services ;-,. (a) whether the; skilled man -power already at the disposal of theServices is being used with due .economy and. effect;(b) whether the Service arrangements for training skilled men are suchas to. meet to the greatest practicable extent the Servicerequirements for skilled men&apos;;:        (c) whether the demands of the Services for skilled men as recruits to, Service trades during the period ending,31st March, 1942, should in&apos; \ .      any respect be modified&quot;. -,   -,-2*     J^JigrL^Re^ort.: . At your request, at/the.end- of July, we submitted anInterim Report, so that you could deal without&apos; delay with current, demands forskilled.&apos;men in-the Services,     In doing-so, we. emphasised the fact that wewere&apos; still at a-very early stage of our enquiry./-.,. But in view-of theimperative need of securing that the machines of war &quot;oh which the lives ofthe fighting men-.and the safety&apos; of the country depend&quot; should never failbecause: of.-inadequate, maintenance and,-repairs,, ,-we, recommended&apos;that certainpercentages.of the. requirements already.submitted by theVServioes should beadmitted on account. &apos;   We felt -justified-in. doingthis, hji view of the vigorousaction taken in the Services to re-muster men. for skilled work, of their ---extensive systems of technical training and of the high degree of&apos; dilution whichwe had observed in their&apos;workshops.     We-should add that, while1 -the- requirementsfor skilled men which were before us at. the time of preparing ourInterim Report,,.and to which our suggested percentages applied, Weresubstantial in respect of the Navy and-of the Air.Force, the requirements inrespect of the Army was small and related almost wholly to men of limited skill.Shortly after&apos;&apos;the presentation&apos;,of our. Interim Report, revised requirements on alarger scale -and including a high, proportion of&apos;fully skilled men from industrywere submitted by the War Office.&apos;,     These are the revised, requirements towhich we refer in the-present report.     : - -3.     Two Questions Reserved;   While making, to meet your request, suchrecommendations as we cpuld in the light of our Imowledge .at the &quot;end of lastJuly, we&apos; reserved for further examination two- questions.     One was the scaleof the demands for skilled men in the&quot;:Services which should ultimately beadmitted;   the,other if/as the extent to which such demands, when admitted,could be iflet within each Service by transference ,of men whose skill wasinadequately used in*their present positions.     The first of these questionsinvolve^&apos; examination of the- programmes and the establishments of theService Departments &apos;and discussion of: matters some of which are highly -confidential.     We deal with it; accordingly&apos; -5* so far as we are new able to dealwith/,.it - in a&apos; second part &apos;of our Report., detachable from the rest-.     The secondquestion is more suitable- for public discussion^  it is a matter in regard towhich it is desirable both to obtain, the help of organisations of employers andworkpeople in making enquiry and to communicate to them the results of theenquiry, so that industries which are called on to surrender skilled men to theServices may feel satisfied that the call is inevitable and that everythingpossible has been done to secure the most efficient use-by the Services of themen already belonging to them.     As we stated in our Interim Report &quot;in order .to throw &quot;light,, on the.extent and character of any-avoidable waste of scarceskill in the Services, we have invited associations of employers and ofemployees to bring to ,our notice cases of alleged misuse of skilled men.Until we shall have completed our examination of those cases, we are not in aposition to ;judge ho\7 much avoidable waste of scarce skill still survives theattempts made to reduce it&quot;, -/  *
4**     Scope of Second Report; . We now submit a Second Report, confined, likeour Interim Report, to men of engineering and allied occupations.    We t;continue to exclude from our examination.wireless and radio mechanics, whosesupply is under consideration by another Committee.&apos;   - We give, first, theresults of our investigation, with the help of employers and-trade unions, oMthe use now being made of skilled men. in the Services.   . We; deal then witheach of the Services separately,, in the light-both of the results of thisinvestigation and of other enquiries made by the study of. documents, by. . ,personal visits of members of the Committee and by inspections carried out .onOur behalf.     These enquiries have included,visits to Service establishments&apos;of all kinds in many different- parts&apos; of the country.     We wish to place.onrecord here the cordial readiness of the Service Departments to furnish uswith any information for which we asked and the courtesy and helpfulnessinvariably shown to us and to our representatives-..USE OF -S1QXLED 1.33XT 331 THE) SERVICES.;.&apos; -5&quot;     Employers&apos; and Union Lists;   In response to our invitation referred to inpara. 3 we received, in addition to many individual names, lists of men ofengineering experience, previously engaged by two important engineering firmsand by three Railway Companies, now serving in the Forces.     We received from-three trade unions - the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Electrical TradesUnion, and the National Union of Sheet Hetal Workers - substantial -lists oftheir serving members who appeared to be insufficiently employed according totheir&apos;skill; we received a few names also from other sources&apos; including certainother trade unions.     From the lists thus submitted we;selected upwards of200 men for interview at the Offices of the Committee and, by the cordialco-operation of the Service Departments concerned,; we were able^ in the bulk ofthe cases, to secure their attendance before us.     The interviews wereconducted by the Chairman of the Committee or by. him and one of the members ofthe Committee with, as a rule, the assistance of. representatives of theemployers or unions concerned as well as of representatives of the ServiceDepartments,     Some of the men summoned, for various reasons, were not .available, and&apos;a.few of.those who attended proved to fall outside the scope ofour enquiry.     But from these interviews we have been able to compile briefrecords of the civil experience and service careers of 16$ men of engineeringand allied occupations who are now in the Forces,     We have classified thesemen under six heads numbered I to.VI, with reference to the degree to whichtheir skill is being used or is nQt being used in their present positions.^*     Headquarters&apos; Interviews;   The results of this personal examination-of..men at.Headquarters&quot;are set out in Appendix A with the scheme of classificationadopted, a description of the types of men placed in each class, a Table (IV)-showing the numbers in each class, divided by Services and Corps and theindividual record- of each of the 16$ men.     This Appendix is an essential-partof our Report and should be read by all who seek to form a judgment upon ourconclusions;   it should be read subject to the cautions which we give inpara. 8.     As is stated in that paragraph, our Headquarters Interviews are nota; random sample from which an inference can be made as to..the quantity ofskill not used in the Forces;   they are concrete; illustrations of a practicalhuman problem whose nature cannot be. understood/ unless it is studied in theconcrete.    The classification of the men represents our judgments.     Thecomments of the Service Departments on some of the cases are given inbrackets at&quot; the end. ,of each individual record in Appendix A..    Here theresults of our interviews are summarised in the.briefest possible way.7.     Classification of Hen seen;   In our first three classes we have placed menwho appear to us either to be well employed (i) or sufficiently employed havingregard to the degree of their skill (II), or as to whom action has been takenbefore our interview which should bring about their suitable employmentshortly (ill);   of the total of 169 men 57 or just over a third are in one-orother of these three classes. &apos;..   In Classes TV and V we have placed men whoappear to us capable of better use than their present use in the Services,,either because though not fully skilled they are&apos; unused-good material fortraining (Class IV), or because their present1 occupation though responsibledoes not make full use oif their, special ability (Class: V);   31 men or ratherover one-sixth of the: whole number are placed by us in one or other of thesetwo classes.     In Class VI we have placed men each of whom represents definitefailure to use in his present Service position&quot;industrial qualifications forwhich there is an urgent unsatisfied demand elsewhere,,  either in the Servicesor outside;  .81 men, nearly half of the whole number interviewed, appear inthis ciass,  , The. men placed by us in this class an.d the- reasons which bringthem there are the critical part of our problem.    About ha^f; of these men,distinguished ,is Class VIb, are not mustered in a Service trade corresponding
fo-their skill.or are not mustered in a Service trade at all.     The other hadistinguished as Class Via, are mustered in a Service trade more-or less &apos;ponding to their skill, hut are not and have not been!working at that tradealf appreciable extent,   They are graded and paid as skilled ^men, as fitterselectricians, coppersmiths, patternmarkers and the like, but they&apos;4 are not and havenot been, doing work which requires, their skill-   some have been engaged almostwholly on general military duties.     Class- V^ wh^e representing less completef^if \ vtUSS    i   &apos; ?SO ?ails f6r ^^ation,&quot;    Of the men whom we have placedin -Class.VI as not used or in Class V as insufficiently used, five out of six are ll7*   i i   i   aany ef them are the product of formal apprenticeship, combinedlith technical education.                                                                  -g(    Three Cautions:   In interpreting these results, three cautions must beborne in mind.     First, the interviews record statements made by the. men andnot checked by reference to their units,   : Such references would undoubtedlyput a different colour cn some of the cases.     But the statements were made inthe presence both of Service officers and of employers or union officialsfamiliar with the trades in, question, and every effort was made by us to impressupon&apos; the men the need for accuracy and fairness in their statements.     Second,our procedure has involved a.scrutiny of the practical working of Service Departmentsin relation to man-power-closer, than that which it is possible to apply to; industry.It is an audit and every: audit shows errors which must be judged with due senseof proportion.     Third, the Headquarters Interviews represent not a fair sampleof the Services, but a selection heavily biased in the direction of bringing tolight misfits and misuse.     The men included in the trade union lists were men asto whose use complaint had been made to the unions.   In selecting for interviewfrom the employers&apos; lists, men who appear to be obviously well used were ingeneral omitted.     The employers&apos; lists accordingly, though less biased than theunion lists, have some bias towards showing misfits.     Bias enters into theemployers&apos; lists in another way as well;   these lists Include more than the normalproportion of men mobilised at-the outbreak of war as territorials or reservistsand therefore posted in the first instance without regard to their civilian-occupations.     It should be added that both the employers&apos; and the union lists,contain more skilled men relatively to semi-skilled and unskilled than would befound either in the engineering -industry as a whole or among men drawn from&apos;thatindustry into the Forces.     This in itself increases the proportion of men placed inClass VI or Class V; the Services in general .find it harder to make:, full use. Ofhighly skilled men than of those with less skill.     No conclusion can be drawn- fromthe Headquarters Interviews alone as to the proportion that would fall into Class VT,if all men of engineering occupations in the Forces could be examined.     Theseinterviews need to be supplemented and have been supplemented in two ways,described in paragraphs 10-13.9.    Differences between and within the Services;   In the summary just given, nodistinction has been made between the Services.     There are, however, markeddifferences between the three Services and within them.     Very, few cases relatingto the Navy were brought&apos; to our notice and none of the few men interviewed appearto us to fall into Class VI, though this negative result must be corrected by theconsiderations set out in paragraph Ik below.     The Air Force, in relation to thenumber of its Service tradesmen, has very few cases in our Headquarters Interviewsand those few show a smaller proportion in Class VI than does airy part of the Army.Within the Army difference Corps yield very different results.     This is illustratedby Table I setting out for each of the Corps of the Army mainly concerned, and forthe Air Force, the numbers of men ranked by us in Classes I - III,.Classes IV - Vand Class VI respectively.     The various corps are arranged in the order of theproportions shown by them in Class VI.     Of the men in each Corps or Service shown in-Table I, the Royal Engineers have much the largest proportion in our Class VI - fourout of every five men seen.     The Royal Army Ordnance Corps and the Royal Air Forcehave the smallest and roughly the same proportions - about one in four of those seen.The other Corps of the Army are intermediate in position, with the Royal Army ServiceCorps, the Royal Corps of Signals and the Royal Artillery coming next to the RoyalEngineers and each with much the same proportion in Class VI - about half those seen.Though the Headquarters Interviews are not a guide to the percentage of men whose&amp;cill would be found to be unused: if all men. of engineering skill were examined, theyare a^guide to the relative positions of different Corps.     There is no reason whybias in the selection of men for interview should affect one Corps more than another.Station Interviews; In the case of the Array, the Headquarters Interviews havebeen supplemented by interviews at stations conducted on the same basis and leadingto the same scheme of classification,- but covering so far-as-possible, all or a fairsample^of the men in each unit examined who, in civil life, had pursued engineeringor allied occupations.     These Station Interviews are; described in; Appendix B,     Thestatistical results are summarised in Table II below,vsetting out in parallelcolumns for each of four separate Corps the numbers in Classes I - III, IV - V andVI respectively.

But the menseen at the Stations should be a fair sample of all the men of engineeringand allied occupations.     71 out of the total of 187 or nearly two fifthsare placed in our Class vT,     Of the men in each Corps the proportion placedin that Class is more than two thirds for the Royal Engineers; about;one thirdfor the Royal Army Service Corps and the Royal Corps of Signals;   and nearly aquarter for the Royal Artillery.-   These proportions are, as we. should expectthem to be, less in all cases than those for the Headquarters Interviews.But they remain very substantial and the. order in which the Corps stand is., the same in Table- II as in Table I.     -Allowing--for the different method, ofselecting men to be seen, the Station Interviews, conducted at the unitsthemselves^-by different, persons and with opportunities for discussionwithUnit-commanders; confirm substantially :the conclusions suggested by theHeadquarters Interviews.11*     Workshops and other units;   The Station Interviews confirm also anotherresult of our other enquiries, namely that there is less failure to use skill -&apos;fully.in the -larger - workshops than elsewhere in the. &quot;Forces.     This appearsstrikingly in the contrast between the heavy workshop and the other units ofthe Royal Army Service Corps for which separate figures are given in Table IIabove * v Nearly-threequarters of the workshop group are In our Classes I - III,as against- a little more than a quarter&apos;of:the other group;   only a sixth ofthe workshop men are in&quot; our Class&apos;VX as.not used in their trades as comparedwith-, one -half..of. the. other men.     The inspectors who, at an&quot; early stage of ourinvestigation visited a number of Army workshops presented on the whole amarkedly more favourable picture-of vthe use. of --skilled&apos; men than-has emergedfrom our. subsequent enquiries which have covered men&apos; working; in units of allkinds.     In the pase qf the Air Fproe, both, our &quot;own Visits&apos; and-the- reports ofour inspectors led&apos; to&quot; asimilar oonclusibhi:   that in these workshops skilled!il men.:in general, were used with remarkable economy, and Pff eat,;..:&apos;.,The problem ofthe use. of skilled men&apos; in the &quot;Services , centres largely round the operationaland training units.

^3.     Service contrasts:   The results of the comparison made in Table III are -striking.  ., Of men/entering the Navy from these two engineering firms, nearlyf&amp;reequarters. are now- mustered in responsible or slcilled engineering posts.Among those entering the Air Force the proportion rmstered-as responsible&quot; orskilled engineers is much leas than in the Navy-, but.more than  tyi of&apos; thewhole number are In some engineering trade,. Skilled:or: semi-skilled;   another33^ are in air crews or under training for-them.    If the priority of flyingover technical duties, (discussed in paragraph 53.1helpw) is.accepted, the Navyand,the AiriForce, so far as this sample goes,,each in their different: ways,make good use of most of the engineers v/ho come to them.     Ambng;&quot; those, enteringthe Army, the proportion advanced to. skilled engineering posts is only one in ,seven, and at the end of. two years of war more than half those men whose civiloccupations were engineering, had,not been mustered in any engineering trade.14.     Nayal Reservists put.of place;: ;The Navy offers the best chance toengineers,    -Nevertheless, even in-the. Navy, there are men of engineering skillnot turned to full aocount. . Special enquiries made of the, employers showthat of the six naval reservists placed in Section D above.,; three are fullyskilled men&apos; whose civilian &quot;skill is not. being used;   a toolmaker serving as atelegraphist; --a horizontal miller^ serving as stoker;   a chargehand &apos;electrician serving -as signalman, ... One is a. &quot;good semi-skilled man!1 who shouldbe. fit for more than being an able . seaman.    ,One has been discharged from theNavy, for ill health and one is case .68; of the. Headquarters Interviews. placed inGlass V (a fitter serving as sick bay attendant).     It should be added thatpf the two air mechanics.named in Section B one is a skilled centre latheturner and one-a. semi-skilled- electrician;   both., are prima facie capable ofmore responsible-work., - ,&quot;    &apos;,.s &apos;. &apos;15. *&apos;- Extent of failure to use skill; -,When full -allowance has been made forthe , grounds for caution, set out in.. paragraph 8, the extent to which men ofrare-skill find that skill unused in the. Forces remains disturbing andsurprising.    ..It is the more surprising In view, of/the vigorous efforts made inall.three Services, and described&apos;-in, our Interim Report, to bring about a.re-mustering an  using of meh: according&apos;tp. their skill.     These efforts have beenalmost - continuous since-the early d^ys: of Ithe Var/&apos;   For one reason or anotherthey have fallen-short-o;f&apos;their&apos;purpose.r   In the figures given above, men fromthe employers&apos; , lists and&apos;from&apos;-the,...trade union lists havebeen combined.    As mightbe expected,-:the.former show, a larger proportion.of men well used than do thelatter-.since they are men- as, to, whom complaint&apos; or,representation had been made totheir union. ,, 0&apos;f the men brought to our: notice&apos; by trade unions and interviewed,two thirds&apos;have been placed by us in Classes V- or VI as insufficiently used or not-used.- The trade unions have made out their case;&apos;  they have, shown failure to usemen -according, to their skill in a substantial number of cases, and have provedthe heed to take more effective measures in future-. V&apos;16..&apos; . Continuing.co-operation with industry&apos;-&apos; In making -their case the tradeunions, and the employers who furnished- lists, have-hot only proved the need forbetter adjustment of skill to duties but have providedv.practical, assistance inbringing&apos;it, about.     The lists have-been welcomed by the Service Departmentsas;a means of bringing to their; notice men whose,technical qualifications, forone reason or another, had.escaped effective notice hitherto.    Steps have beentaken in all three Services to.&quot;secure better-use ofmaijy of the men interviewedby us or included ih lists &quot;sent to us, though n6t interviewed., as stated atthe end of paragraph/!?, the information furnished by -two employers hals beenfollowed, by &quot;instructions from, the War Office for training or, testing . of 79 menhot hitherto engaged vin their-trades,    5fhiie the present Report was beingprepared, we were invited by the Army Council to continue this process&apos;&quot; ofsecuring the- clp-operation, of&quot;industry-- in&apos;bringing about the-be&amp;t use of men; Of rare skill;&apos;, --that Isto-say, of asking employers, and trade&quot;&apos;unions to send-.us lists &quot;of-men-sillied in engineering and allied occupations now servingin the Army,, with particulars of their civilian work and qualifications-.    Withyour assent; we have .&apos;gladiy undertaken to &quot;do this., and the Army Council has.&apos; egtabiistie^ne^ machinery for examining in..consultation with ourselves thelists of &quot;men received, and discovering the men &quot;who could be used to&quot; more\advantagev;ll..The other Service&apos;Departments have welcomed application-of * the&quot;same procedure to theNavy and the.

17,    Meaning of our Classification:   This.continuing  oofopterationf^.-between the Service Departments: Jand industry willy we believe, be a measu^fiof great importance in bringing about progressively better use of skilled men 8in the Forces,   Before proceeding to consider what other measures may be  .needed in regard to each of the Services separately, we make- two generalcomments.     One comment relates to the meaning of our classification&apos;.     Theplacing of a man in Class VI does not of necessity imply that there hasbeen some error by the Service Department, - concerned in mustering -him or Hin trade testing.    About half of these men, as is stated above j are -   &apos; Jjcorrectly mustered.     The question is whether they should be so mustered        *Hhaving regard to the work to. be done, that is to say, whether talcing account    aboth of present and future commitments any men or so many men of theirqualifications are. required in the particular unit in which they findthemselves, - Again, either because of the special character.of their skill or  Ifor. other personal reasons some men are hard to fit into any Service trade;such men may appear in our Class VI because they have rare skill which is not   llbeing used, not because the Service Departments.-have neglected opportunities    mof turning them to account.     The Service Departments have done all that they  Icould to:use them;   4s we suggest in. paragraph 58 the only way of using their  Ispecial skill may be &quot;to return them to civilian Industry,18-,   v-Attitude of the men;   Out1 other comment relates to a general conditionaffecting the work of all Service Departments, that is to say, the attitude of 9the men themselves,&apos;   The Service Departments have compulsory powers, but the  Imaterial with which they deal is human- - the citizens of a free, countryt    A    anumber of men have joined &quot;all three Services, but particularly the Army andthe Air &quot;Forpe, as territorials, auxiliaries, reservists, or volunteers,, onunderstandings&apos; as to the Corps;or unit in which they should serve, which cannot Ibe disregarded.     Our own investigations have shown us skilled men whopreferred to-remain as balloon operators or drivers, as flight mechanics or. ; Istoremen, among their friends, in&apos; place of moving elsewhere to use their skill-nThey have shown&apos; us men who, on entry to the Forces concealed their skill and,. -IContinued&apos;to-conceal it during their service, -because they thought it. mightprevent their acceptance or their posting to the units that they desired.    Theyjlhave shown, particularly in the Air Force, men engaged on useful semi-skilled   mwork, capable of training for more skilled work, but reluctant - to make thechange;   talcing a course looked to them like ceasing to do things- in order to   Ilearn things, like going to school again after being-grown-up,.   &quot;Again&apos;,, though iskilled work,brings higher pay in the Services, there are men for whom, this &apos;    mfinancial inducement to remuster is ineffective.;   men whose Service pay is   &apos;   Ibeing made up to their civilian earnings by their employers may&apos;have nothing tojmgain by Servioe promotions,     Finally, accqunt muist betaken of&apos;;one great and   .1saving quality-of British people.; ;. readiness to..take -what come&amp;&apos; to them in war fjand to make the best of it.   &apos; When, to this general quality are-added the . specialscauses which may make, individual men re luctarit.,or-apathetic about re-musteririg,;8or their Commanding Officers . reluctant, to. lose them;, it, is easy to understand - ..mwhy re-mustering of every man- according to-,-.skill,&apos;j though accepted as a&quot;--principle by Service Departments,&apos; does not alwaysoccur in practice,. &quot; In        Isaying this wo do not mean to suggest that lack of desire on the part of the    mmen to be used according to their skill is a general cause of the misfits   . ;which -have, came to our notice. &apos; &quot;&apos;0n. the&apos;:&apos;contraryour investigations, whilethey.-have shown as the dominant -eharacteristift pf,-, the men!- in our-Forces sense-of discipline, and determination -to bear -and- make the-best . of everything that...-&apos;comes,, to them, have shown as another characteristic eagerness- to give thegreatest Service which they qould,...

THE ROYAL NAVY.        . ...^J.     Few misfits in the Navy;   None of the naval ratings-interviewed by theCommittee&apos;at Headquarters appeared so skilled or so little: used according to &apos;his skill, as to justify inclusion in. Class VI,   This negative result must&apos;:&apos;1be interpreted in the light of the Conditions uiider v/hich the Navy Virorks,   -The Navy has expanded in. war less, than either of the other services,-and has .been able to build on broad..:fouhdation.s&apos; firmly established.The greater partof its men are. at sea, and When at sea^-they are largely in action.   - The datafrom the employers1 lists, summarised in paragraphs 12-14, make it clear that /&quot;:among those who have been called to the .Navy as..,reservists there arevsome men &apos; &apos;vfhose engineeringskill. is ijot being&apos;/-used; It^-s-tepg- taken to comb out suchmen from their nontechnical occupations have;not.;worked with 100/&quot;efficiency,&quot;&quot;: ,It is probable,, also^ .from-.our other enquiries/that in the- relatively Jhew--&apos;fields.

Review Of Establishjnents^:   There has been reduction of establishmentsin the Navy by substitution &quot;of men of lower olass for those of higher, classamong Engine Room Artificers, by   introduction of new grades of mechanics.assubstitutes for Artificers, by reduction in the number of stokers and in otherways.     This was a means of meeting sudden calls for additional skilled and semi-skilled ratings to man new ships.    Recently a Committee has been appointed bythe Admiralty &quot;to review and staffing of horned bases with a view to ensuring thatthe complements are assessed on the most economical basis possible&quot; and withinstructions t,o report whether any&quot;;of the personnel at these bases can bedispensed with, whether any of the personnel can be relieved by men with lessprofessional,-experience or. lower technical:skill, or by members - of the Women1sRoyal-Naval-Service,, or by older men entered from shore...      &apos;      .&quot;    -.24*. .-.

THE ARMY.2i    Special difficulties of the Army; - There are several factors which havemaW &quot;adjustment of&apos; supply to demand and full use of skilled men harder for the riny. than it is for either of the other Services; or it may he added, forcivilian industry, .&apos; 1 -       &apos; , &apos; . &apos; &quot;&quot;&apos;   &apos;.The Army, has-expanded more than either of the other Services and much     --&apos;more than,tlrie munitions&apos; industries;   its rate of growth has &quot;been-subjectto violent &quot;fluctuations.    An industrial organisation which, after-&apos;aperiod of &quot;growth, comparable to that of the Army, was subjected to ascrutiny as ;thprbugh as that which has been applied to the Army wouldbe lucky if it.&apos;failed to show many misfits. ...At &quot;the beginning -of the war, the Army received&apos; numbers of men, eitherthrough&quot; calling up as territorials -and. reservists or through posting &apos;-..,-as-militia, in&apos;regard to whom it-Was not possible to exercise&apos;selectionin assigning them to appropriate &quot;trades or units.    A large part&apos; of thesteps taken in the past two years to comb-out skilled men has been \concerned with correcting&quot; this initial mal-adjustment.. &apos; &quot; (c) The Army, -:while growing, has had to change, its character, by progressive-. increase in.- the proportion of armoured and.-mechanised divisions to other.-.    arms*    It is--important to&apos;realise, however, that an Army can never  &quot;... become wholly mechanioal,.in the-sense- of a Navy or an Air Force, of- .....     fighting wholly.from -machines.^ ,   One. of the, special problems of Army-organisation^ saa^t^its^ask :mrder than that,of other Services,- is that,of co-ordinating Its:mech&apos;anical,;&apos;-and its Other arms..;. (d) The character of the inrar, with the expedition to France&apos; leading to a lossof &quot;so large a par t of, previous - equipment and to the subsequent long&apos; -&apos;. &quot;   period of restoration-&quot;and waiting, in England, has added to thedifficulties of adequate&apos;; use of the&apos;manpower in the Army*(e). The Army is--not &amp; cehtralispa! -Service- like the Navy or the Air Force, but. a combination pf distinct corps and of units with,- in many cases, strong&apos;&quot; local associations&apos;-or sectional traditions.    The;lpyalty both of men andof their commanders .is often, in the first instance,./! a loyalty to their. particular unit-or &quot;corps..and sets up obstacles to- transfer which do notoccur In the. Other Services,&apos;- : The machinery of transfer is necessarily&quot;- more c.omplioate6U-:.[ i &apos;These -difficulties in bringing about full use of skilled men in the Army mustbe recognised,; ; They make the task of the Army in this matter much harder than thatof either of the other Services,     The moral of this is not that we should becontent to waste rare skill- in the Army any more -than anywhere else.     The moral is .that stronger.... steps are needed&apos; to deal with a more difficult problem,28,- Measures already taken;   Before indicating the nature of these steps, it isappropriate to point out how much has been done already.    Under the twoArmy Council Instructions 1298 of October,&apos;1940 and 424 of March, 1941, referredto in our Interim Report, over 93,000 applications for technical training ortransfer have been received from men in the Army.    Of these about 23,000 in tradesother than engineering and electrical still remain to be classified;   70,000,including all those in engineering and allied occupations, have already beenexamined and dealt with,    6,000 have been found to be unsuitable for training and17,000, have been treated as unavailable for courses, because made from corps inwhich transfer was barred or relating to trades in which applications were notrequired.    But nearly 32,000 men have been sent to trade tests or course which theyhave passed or have-been sent to courses which they are still pursuing while another10,000 have been detailed to gb to courses, later.     In total the measures alreadytaken should bring about the/transfer of over 40,000 men. -; In addition, the Armyhas released to industry more, than 50,000 men.29,   The need for further measures;   Though so much has been done, there cannothe reasonable doubt that further measures are needed.    In respect of theArmy, our investigation has shown a continuing failure to use men ofengineering skill according to their skill, which has surprised us by its extent,lie
In the Headquarters Interviews, well over half of the men from the Army are ipClass VI and less than one-third are in Classes I - III,   (Table I) ,     In theStation Interviews, not biased in any way, nearly two fifths of the men are inClass VI, and the same proportion are in Classes I - III.   (Para. 10).     In theemployers&apos; lists analysed as a whole and equally without bias5 less than half ofthe engineers Joining the Army have been mustered after tavo years of war in anyengineering trade (para. 13),    A large proportion of the men placed by us inClass VI represent the cream of industry.     They include highly   skilledengineers of all kinds, millwrights, turners, toolmakers, fitters, coppersmiths,eleotricians, boilersmiths, panel heaters, pattern makers*    Most of these menhave come in as volunteers, through the Territorial Army&apos;6r as reservists, hutothers have come in under conscription some within the past, three months, bycancellation of deferments o    Nothing better can be supplied by any form ofde-reservation.    Every man of this type withdrawn from    civilian industryrepresents a blow to production of munitions.     Up to the present there is noguarantee that men of this type now supplied to the Army will be used oh workthat needs them.SO.   A reservoir of unused skill;   All our investigations point to the sameconclusion;   that the reservoir of unused engineering skill&apos; already in the Armyis larger   in total than the revised requirements for skilled men of engineeringand allied occupations laid before us by the War Office0    This does not meanthat every such requirement can be met from within the Army;   the men requiredare of different degrees of skill and responsibility and for one special classdiscussed in paragraph 46 below, special measures may be needed.     It does meanthat, apart from this special class, the, requirements can be met from within theArnr/j if the reservoir which we have found can be made available for thispurpose.    What steps are needed to secure this?    The possibility of makingthe reservoir available depends on changes in the organisation and theadministration of the Army directed to dealing effectively with the distinctproblems presented by those whom we have placed in Class Via and those who arein Class Vlb.    The former (Nos. 95-130 in Appendix A) are mustered in appropriateService trades, but not using their skill beoause the work with a view to whichthey are mustered is not available or because the work which they are doing ormay be required to do does not need their degree of skill.    The latter(Nos. 131-169) are men who are not mustered in any Service trade correspondingto their skill.^*   Review of Army Establishments;   The treatment of the first of these troclasses raises important issues of Army organisation and of provision foroperational emergencies.    More than half the soldiers whom after interview weplaced in Class Via are, in the Royal Engineers j   they are there normally thoughby no means invariably, in accord with the approved establishment of each unit.It may be claimed in regard to them that, however little their skill may havebeen required in this country hitherto, they are an essential part of their units,waiting to deal with .the unpredictable emergencies that may arise in action inthis country or abroad.     It would be absurd to reject such a claim altogether.As Tire pointed out in our Interim Report &quot;war in certain phases involves standingby to act rather than acting;&apos; .in war engineers like others must be kept waitingeither not fully occupied or occupied otherwise than as engineers but ready touse their skill in emergencies at a moment&apos;s notice&quot;.    We certainly do notreject a claim to hold power&apos; in reserve for emergencies.    But when it is seenhow much that claim involves -of lost production and of the resting of rare skillin idleness, it is fair and necessary to urge that the amount of such waitingshould be reduced to the irreducible minimum.     The establishments of thedifferent operational units of the Royal Engineers, the Royal Artillery, the&apos;Royal Corps of Signals and other corps in respect of engineering tradesmen werefixed before the acute, shortage, of skilled engineers was realised.     The time hascome when all these establishments should be reviewed by a committee of decisiveauthority and high technical&apos; qualifications, in the light of the newmaterial provided by our enqtiiry, with a view both to reducing wherever possible
the total numbers.of such tradesmen and to substitution of semi-skilled forskilled men.;:   This new systematic review-,of-establishments is vital,, because-without it nearly half the prbbjlji^ -the&apos;&apos;-men&apos; -of -ourClass VI a - will.be,-left&apos;.untouched.1 - The review should take-account (a)-1 ofthe famine of sld-iled^^hgfeeer&amp;l . (b) of the -changed operational &quot;requirementsresulting from mechanisation of&apos; the Army;   (c) of the possibility of revisingtitles and qualifications of Service trades so as to avoid drawjing &quot;skilled meninto trades which require at most semi-skilled&apos;menj   (d) of the-possibilityof substituting less-, skilled for more skilled men, through organising repairsupon a basis of assembly and replacement rather than of fitting;   (d). of-. thepossibility of economising men of rare, skill by pooling, resources betweendifferent Corps and Units.    The last two. points call for&apos;comment. -        - --.32.   De-skllling of repairs?   It is doubtful whether any large number ofhighly skilled men will ever be needed In such corps, as the Royal Engineers,the Royal Artillery, and the Royal&apos; Armoured Corps, or, will find&apos;, the- equipmentor material to exercise their skill in war conditions if they, are; there.Maintenance and repair of war machines in the field must,- to a large&apos; extent,take the form, of assembly and replacement, i,e. of using men of moderate skillfamiliar with these machines, to, take out damaged parts and replace themv    Alimited number of highly Intelligent, skilled men are needed for diagnosis andsupervision.    The bulk of the work is work for trainees.&apos;    The/place for;mostskilled men is in a workshop whether in this country or -.overseas,,    But&apos;,de-skilling of repairs depends on adequate, supply of spares arid getting themwhere they are wanted.     This is a point affecting Services other than theArmyj   ?/e return to it later (para, 56),33.   Pooling of mechanical resources:   The Army is based upon Corps and upon -units&quot;;   we do not undervalue the importance of seeing that each unit.&apos;.is &quot;-closely-knit and self reliant.. ,  But neither unit nor Corps-should seek to beself-contained,.    Break-up. of the- engineering work of the Army, between Corpsand units, to the extent to which it is carried today&apos;, involves,duplication ofworkshops and multiplication of reserves of skilled men&apos;and special equipment.The most economical use of scarce, resources depends upon pooling .them as-&apos;fullyas possible.    Extensive use of armoured fighting vehicles makes it Certainthat for their sake there must.be skilled men - and equipment capable of   -difficult mechanical repairs within reach of the front line, however, that maymove.    Pooling of mechanical &quot;resources, is - One of. the objects in view &quot;in theproposal made below (para. 44) for a.Corps of Mechanical Engineers. &apos;  It is notthe only object there in view and it could be realised to a large extentwithout that particular proposal.&apos;.- . &quot;v34.   Better use of &quot;men&apos; waiting;   By review of establishments, -on. the linessuggested, we believe that substantial economies of ,skilled men in-the Armycan be achieved without risk..    In so,far as some establishment &quot;of skilled, menmust be kept in units, without present. wcrk.-f or thereto &quot;deal with emergencieswhich may arise .in action though they have.not arisen yet, the economical wayof keeping such men is not&apos;. tb. keep - --them idling&apos; and -&apos; was ting; their skill, intheir engineering or artillery units, but to post them to large.-, organised-workshops such as those of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps.&apos;    The.. numberofskilled men now standing idle in &quot;other--corps would be&apos; ample. ,tb put&apos; night-shiftsinto all the main ordnance workshops.     They would use their-skill,. and -they. ..would be available at an instant&apos;s notice to &quot;fill their, emergency positions&apos;orto proceed overseas.    An unexpectedly large draft from such workshops would&apos; &apos;.&apos;,-merely mean that repair work Was passed back to. civilian Industry as it-is -----today. &apos;-.-. -       &apos;. -t      &apos;; -&apos;-.. -    \ %&apos; &apos;,    &apos;35*   Strengthening of Army machinery&apos;; - The, special problem of the men in  &apos;.&apos;.Class Via suitably mustered but not used in-their, trades,, heeds-special.   &apos;treatment.&apos;   But it is, part only of the Army&apos;s problem in the;.-use of skilled -engineers.    Our investigation both through interviews and through visitingArmy establishments, leads us to suggest a number of points in which theexisting machinery for economical-use of skilled men in the Army appears, tocall for strengthening.     They include improvement of posting arrangements,   .improvement of trade testing, improvement of technical ttaining,,.reduction of ,barriers to transfer and, most important of all, more effective sorting and;   .selection,   - :
36*   Improvement of posting arrangements;   Under the existing arrangements itis still top common for men to &quot;be posted to stations.without reference to thevolume of work to be done there and without reference to the establishment oftheir Station,    Sometimes there seems to be no reason for such postings.    (?)Sometimes the place to which a man is posted seems to be dictated byconsideration of where he can be housed, rather than by consideration of wherehe can be employed usefully.37,   Improvement of trade testing:   This needs centralisation andstandardisation.     The present methods often lead to anomalies.    Numbers ofhighly skilled men remain in Class III of their trades without any opportunityof testing and promotion/    Other less skilled men find themselves promoted.The   grading of a man today as 1* II or III in his trade is little guide to thedegree of his skill, and could not he used as basis of selecting men fortransfer.    We should add that representations have been made to us that testsfair in themselves are sometimes made unfair by failure to provide suitabletools*38e     Improvement of technical training;   The extensive training arrangemrntsof the Army organised since the outbreak of war through technical institutions,Government Training Centres and private firms are an admirable improvisation,but as is inevitable in such improvisation, some of the different parts of.this system are not sufficiently closely related to one another or to the .    .practical objects of training.&apos;&apos; The older Army establishments for technicaltraining, so far as we have seen them are excellent.    Some of the others, wellplanned in themselves, suffer from being established far too late.    But themain change required in the technical. training of the Army is a better seleotionof trainees,39,   Reduction of barriers to transfer;   In all the measures taken hithertoby the Army Council to bring about re-mustering of men according to their skill,special restrictions have been placed upon transfers from one Corps to another,Thus a. man otherwise suitable for re-mustering might be excluded fromconsideration, if this involved a transfer and he was already a Servicetradesman or held a certain rank or belonged to a particular Corps.As regards Service trades, under.the Army Council Instruction 1298 ofOctober, 1940, no man could be considered for transfer who was either &quot;alreadymustered as a tradesman or definitely earmarked to fill a trade vacancy in hisown corps in the immediate future&quot;.     This meant that skilled men. who were, inany kind of Army trade, including such trades as despatch rider,- drivermechanic, switchboard operator, locomotive cleaner or pioneer, were barred fromapplying.     Though, this general prohibition was modified in the next .   .instruction, men who had once fallen under it probably in many cases did notrealise the change.    The later Army Council Instruction... No. 424 of March, 1941,&apos;had a more limited list of exclusions, but still, barred men mustered astradesmen in Group 0 or higher groups.    Group C includes such trades as clerk,,lineman, driver operator, nursing orderly, sanitary assistant, storeman,tinsmith,&apos;.so that a man onoemustered in one of these trades, whatever hiscivilian skill, would lose the chance of transfer,    A more general effect ofthis restriction has been   to prevent consideration of men who, though musteredin their correct trade as fitters, coppersmiths, electricians and so forth -had no chance of working in their trades, unless they obtained a transfe!&apos;.Neither of these Instructions has done anything for the men of our Class VI a.As regards rank, A,C.,I.   1298 excluded men above the rank of Lance Corporal,while A.C.I. 424 excludes only those above Corporal rank.     Neither of theseexclusions applies to men under consideration for transfer or training asArmament Artificer, dealt with under a separate instruction (No. 326 of 1941).The formal rules in regard to rank as a barrier are unexceptionable    But itmay be doubted, from our interviews, whether even corporals and ianoe-corporalshave been, in practice, treated as free for transfer.    Certainly some of themhave thought that they were not.As regards Corps, the only general barrier to. transfer has been againstmoving men from the Royal Armoured Corps. -   This again in itself is areasonable rule, but it should   not be a rule without exceptions,     A fullyskilled toolmaker (Case No. 114 in Appendix A) is certain to be&apos; more valuableto the nation today if he works as a toolmaker than in almost any Serviceposition whatever.
Some restrictions on re-mustering men are clearly necessary.    But ingeneral&apos;a.man will&quot; &quot;be better placed in the national interest by reference toj&amp;kill which it has taken him (say) five years of apprenticeship, three yearsof night school and some years as a journeyman to acquire as&quot; a craftsman ina scarcity occupation, than by regard for -what he has learned as a soldierin a year or two yearsi    As a Service tradesman, he does noib cea&amp;e to &quot;be. asoldier or lose all that he has learned of soldiering.40*   Sorting and selection by interviews   The machinery for&apos; finding andselecting men for Service trades and/or training needs:-(a) to be stronger in itself, i,e, with more authority and a larger staff jto be able to ensure that the opportunity and duty, of re-mustering soas to use one&apos;s scarce slcill to the utmost in the general interest arebrought effectively to the notice of all menjto have authority to overcome obstruction on the part of the menthemselves to change of trade or units Efficient trade testing, byensuring that a really skilled man would be graded Class I or Class IIand paid accordingly would facilitate transfers, since the technical. .pay would compensate for loss of rank pay. There are other financialbarriers to re-mustering - such as loss of trade pay while training ;for a new and better trade - which should be removed. &apos;to operate not by paper forms alone, but by expert interviews,     Thecapacity of men for skilled work and for training cannot be judgedon the scanty forms now used or indeed by means of forms at all.Before sending men to a lengthy training course, it is worth while to;&apos; ...-have them up to a limited number of centres for interview by technicalexperts familiar with the training courses and their purpose,. -Selection by unit commanders who are&apos;neither expert engineers nor withany. knowledge of the courses is often haphazard.     We have found-cases&apos;- &apos;of men sent on-difficult courses though they lacked the most obvious -.and elementary qualifications for learning,&apos; and of men&apos;sent without    ---&apos;their knowing for what trade they were to be trained.    We have found, -on the other hand, men with years of apprenticeship and night schoolsent to waste their time on elementary courses, or men alreadygraded II in their, trades- drafted to courses for training third classtradesmen.    We,have found men being pushed into trades which wastetheir technical skill,41,   Selection of engineers&quot; by engineers.   The misuses illustrated in the last &apos;&quot;.paragraph - the illustrations could be multiplied indefinitely -.. imply no,    -reflection upon the-goodwill or the intelligence.of commanding officers of units..They arise from asking people who have been trained to perform one.set. ofduties, to undertake something else, something outside, the range of theirexperience and foreign to their major interests and responsibilities; &apos; theyarise from asking laymen to do&apos;the work of experts.     Asked to discoverengineers or to select-men for technical training., very often with little or,noinformation as to the nature of the training and&apos;normally-with no technical, -knowledge himself, the commanding officer-in many cases&apos;has an impossible&apos;task.It should be added that to some&apos;extent the misfits and misuses found in our.enquiries are, or ought to be, things of the past.     Of the 50,000 men- sent fortraining in engineering and allied trades during the first nine-months of 194-1about- 20,000 were chosen by officers commanding units and 50,00.0 by technicalselection boards.     The proportion coming,through the latter channel.is. -&apos;-becoming steadily greater.     The next stage should be for selection boards towork more and more by personal Interviews and not by examination of forms.42*   Two major changes:   We have set out above &apos;a-catalogue of minor, but -important&apos;changes, designed to ensure that the&apos;Army&apos;should use with economyand effect all the technical skill already at its disposal.     The possibility .of bringing about such minor changes may be..found to depend upon the two largerchanges of organisation, which we name in the next two paragraphs.
Proposals for each of these changes have &quot;been under consideration at one timeor another in the paste    Each raises a host of problems and of arguments infavour and against, &apos;   We have not the competence nor is this the place todiscuss these arguments or the possibility of making such major changes at-this moment.    We name,, those proposals because our enquiries, so far as tbiiy ftlhave gone, yield new arguments in their favour, &quot;43, . Enlistment for Army not,for Corps;   One proposal is that men should beenlisted not into this or that Corps, but into the Army as a single Sex^vice,as they are taken into the Royal Navy or into, the Royal Air Force, and thatbeing received, examined, and sorted at centres common to the whole Army, theyshould from those centres be posted to their definite Corps only when it isclear that they fit the requirements of those Corps and that any scarce skillpossessed by them will be turned fully to account.     Our enquiries suggest-that under the present system men get placed before they.can be sufficientlysorted;   they get mis-placed and cannot easily be put right.44*   A Corps of Mechanical Engineers;   The other proposal-is that thcro shouldbe established&apos; in the Army a Corps of Mechanical Engineers,     The success ofthe Navy in&apos;making good use of mechanical engineers is not due solely to thefact that, the naval problems are simpler than,those of the Army,     It is duealso to.the, fact that the Navy has had for,so long- an engineering branch ofhigh authority and has. had other technical&quot;branches specialised on torpedoosand&apos; electricity or ordnance.- &apos;  The Navy is machine-minded. -, The Army cannotafford to be. less so.     The Navy sets, engineers to catch, test, train and useengineers.    Until the Army gives to mechanical and electrical engineers, asdistinct, from civil engineers&quot;, their appropriate, place and influence in theArmy system, such engineers are not likely to be caught,. tested and trained 20well as.in the- Navy;&apos;, there is danger that they will be misused by men whosemain Interests and duties lie in, other fields.-     .. , y45, &apos; New, methods for new^tasks;   The Army, under our audit of the use ofskilied&quot;men^ shows&quot; less well Than do the other Services.,.    This is due mainlyto the fact that the Army&apos;s problems in this&apos; field are harder. &apos;   But, in part,it is due to failure to realise the organisational changes involved insubstituting for an. army mainly of foot-soldiers an army mainly dependent.upon machines and technicians. .. The officers and men of the Army are of thesame breed and spirit as their fellows in the Navy and the Air Force,    Butthey can work only within the frame of an organisation and the frame-needs tobe changed as the nature of war on land is ohanged.    Mechanisation of an Amyshould begin from the top,46.   The special problem of Armament Artificers:   Whether or not, if all theforegoing steps were taken, it would be possible for the Army to meet itsrequirements for skilled men with its existing resources- of such men, it isimpossible today to&apos; say with certainty.     The number of skilled engineersinoluded in the revised- Yfar Off ice requirements is ^probably less than thenumber of such engineers, who are. already- in the. Army and could be madeavailable to meet those requirements.     This applies not only to the totalnumber, but also to most of.the.different types of men required, with oneimportant exception:    that of the highest class of Army tradesnian, the.-Armament Artificers,     These are technical non-commissioned officers able tosupervise and direct expertly the work of other experts.     Such men ars rare. in-&apos;all walks of life.     Some such men there are undoubtedly in. the Army nowdoing inferior work, but it is too much to hope that there are enough of such-men there, to meet the needs of the Army when it, is, fully mechanised.     It islikely, in other wordsj that a certain number of Armament Artificers, as ofNavy Artificers, must be supplied from industry.     We hope that the, number willbe relatively small.     Whatever the number, once it is clear both that ths needfor such men exists and that the Army is organised to make full use of all theskilled men that come to it, we have no doubt that those engaged in industry,whether as employers or as workpeople, will give all the help that they cantowards meeting that need,47.   Conclusion as to the Army:   Apart from the special problem of thsArmament Artificers just mentioned, there is a clear possibility - on ourfigures there is a presumption - that the unused reservoir of engineering skillin the Army is large enough and varied enough to meet all the requirements thathave been submitted to us for men of engineering skill.    Until that presumptionhas been tested and disproved, there is no case for withdrawing men fromindustry to meet those requirements.
TEE ROm AIR FORCE.48*   Intermediate&apos;position of the Air Force;   The Air Force stands intermediatebgfeveen the older Services, in&apos;sxze, in rate of -expansion and in the complexityojrlts problems.    Adjustment of skilled capacity to the work to be done iseasier in this Service than in the Army, but harder than in the Navy,The Air Force stands intermediate also in the results of our investigations.-It is not. so clear or almost clear of complaints of unused skill as is the Navyjit has nothing comparable in scale to the misfits and misapplications, that &apos;-appear in some parts of the Army;   but it.&apos;shows sufficient misfits to call forexpansion Of the measures which the Air Force has &quot;been taking already to deal .with such cases.     This is no ground for weakened confidence in this Service,  &quot;sThe constructive imagination shown by those responsible for.developing the  .&quot;.Air Force and for preparing/ as part of its growth, for the vital task of.maintaining, servicing and repairing airdraft is beyond praise,,     ,vNever inhuman history was so much owed by so many to so few&quot;,    3ut immediately behind,.. -those few who fought Britain^ battle, in the air have been .the many withoutwhose unceasing service oh the ground the few&apos;could not have held the air.And behind those&apos;many,again have stood the few who were called to&apos;plan the ...recruiting, training and equipping of their numbers, and the setting them towork.    No experience is better calculated to.give confidence in our arms, thanto see at close quarters, as we have seen, the administrative machinery behind .-&apos;.-our aircraft, and to appreciate the &quot;organising ability which pervades .th&amp;   ....Air Force.     If, nevertheless, an, audit as meticulous as ours has brought to.&apos;light imperfections in the use of, skilled men, in the Air Force as in the otherServices, this suggests only that what has been done so well can be made better.and will be made better as the result of our enquiry.     The need for takingevery possible step to use men according to their skill has long beenrecognised by the Air Force,    .    . .&quot;&apos;--&apos;49.   Enquiry incomplete&apos;.   That enquiry for the moment is less complete in regardto the Air Force than in regard: to the other Services.,     The number of airmenseen by us at Headquarters is very small, particularly in relation to the largenumber of Service tradesmen,, and the Headquarters Interviews have not beensupplemented by systematic interviews at stations of all kinds.     The greaterpart of our enquiries as to the Air Force up to the present have been conductedin other ways.    We are not in. a position now to make any estimate of the stockof unused or incompletely used skill, in the Air Force or to compare it with therequirements of that Service for skilled men.    We can say only that some stockexists and should be drawn on to meet the requirement, so far as it can.     In  .the larger workshops of the Air Force, our investigators have reported a notableeconomy of skilled men and.a high degree of dilution.    The points to whichadditional attention should be directed are the numbers and grades oftechnicians allowed at operational and training stations;   the methods of tradetesting and selection;   and removal of obstacles to re-mustering.    We raise,also under the head of flying and technical duties, a general issue of .;  .priorities in the use of man-power,50.   Review of Establishments;   Several of the skilled men seen by us expressedthe feeling either that there were too many men of similar skill upon theirstations to leave full employment for all of them or that the work for whichthey were used did not need their skill and could be performed by others oflower qualifications.     There should be a close review of establishments:, witha view to ensuring that all men in the Air Force are pulling against-the collar,as all of them wish to do, . .51*   Trade testing and selection;   Other oases before us indicated occasionalimperfection &apos;of the machinery for selecting and trade testing,    Y/e have foundsome skilled men apparently mustered below their skill. &apos;&quot; We have&apos;met suggestionsthat both.the original tests at reception centres and the tests incidental tocourses of instruction are too &quot;theoretical&quot;.    There is, in respect of tradetesting, an interesting difference between the procedure of the Navy and thatof the Air Force,    Each of these Services, in contrast to the Army,, has.centralised its trade testing so as to secure standardisation, but here-theresemblance between them ends,    The Navy test is practical and mechanipalj   it.depends uppn performance of a set piece of work within a set period.    The testOf the Air Force as conducted at its reception centres is, in general, not apractical test but an interview, in which questions are asked, partly about thecandidate1s previous, experience and partly to probe his general knowledge of hissubjeqto    The view taken in the Air Force v.- is that it is not enough for men topossess mechanical skill; it is more important that they should:have intelligenceand education to learn the new kinds of work which they will -have to do.    We
express no judgement now on the respective merits .Jof these two systems for thedifferent Services.    The nature of the repair:work.to he done in the twoServices -and the conditions undor which it has to he done are different, andmay-well affect the type of men. that should he selected and.&quot;by ooneequer.ce&quot; the,,method of selecting.    One effect, however-, .of the Air Force -method, as we: &apos;have seen in our interviews,&apos;is that men Who&quot; are perfectly good mechanics, - ft &apos;hut either slow to express themselves or with- limited hook learning may findin the Air Foroe no. career that is worthy of their manual skills &apos;   If that isso, such men in place of being used, as some of them now come to be used, onlabouring or semi-skilled duties, should be-set. free for. skilled work-elsewhere. -52.   Obstacles to re-mustering.   Yet another point illustrated by.ourinterviews&quot; is the occasional failure ef men who have once been misplaced,,to be re-mustered according to their skill&apos;.     There is one specific- obstacle tore-mustering which we suggest- should be withdrawn..    This, is the restrictionimposed hitherto upon re-mustering- of men- assigned to. ground defence.-    Defenceof aerodromes is obviously vital, but does not justify retaining indefinitelyas aground1 gunner a man who is either a - skilled engineer or specially qualifiedfor technical training.    Some change has been&apos;made -recently in the rule on .this point, though we   are not sure if it yet has been carried a3 far asnecessary. -   It cannot, we think, be suggested that there would bo dif faculty-in training - all the ground gunners. required from men without engineering skillor experience.   -We-have met cases, also of skilled menkeptas balloon operators,in this case hot through a Service rule, but through their, having entered throughthe Auxiliary Reserve with a view to local servicej   this&apos;is clearly anuneconomical-use of men.     It has now been decided in principle to substitutewomen,for men generally in the operation of balloons and active steps to give&apos; &apos; -effect,to:this change have been taken.-   More important than any Service rule,such as that affecting men-on gr-ound-defence, are the various frictions ofapathy or personal inclination oh. the ,part&quot; of&apos;the men,- or interest or lack ofinterest on the part of their -suporiors.&quot;which1 may keop rare&apos;--skill unused.   Theaim of the Air Force on this- matter, is clear ;   to- secure, re-mustering of evexyman,&quot;according to&apos; his skill and-to push,men forward by trair.arig&apos;&apos;;to better work.But the aim is not always -realised,:- &apos;.&quot;jhere is&apos; perhaps &quot;heed of- -&quot; new maphinery forthis -purpose, -     -    . -    &quot; .-. .  t .&apos;.     - : . .   .539 .Flying and technical duties;   Table.

Awer are the skilled engineers required, the more can &quot;become all.sk for semi-skilled men and trainees under skilled supervision.   Thismethod is dictated by &quot;many considerations:   by the practical conditionsunderwhich repairs must be done in the field, by the famine of skilled engineers,by the risk of&apos; exposing them -end expensive equipment too near to the line ofbattle.   No Supply department -and&apos; no manufacturer, whether in this country orelsewhere, should-be allowed to count a tank or an aircraft as pi-oducod until,with it have been produced the spare parts without which it cannot fulfil itspurpose.57.   Engineers for. those who can us^them:.  Our other principle is. that inwar engineers are Tor tTIbse&apos;!iKb7can-ahoTwill use them as engineers.Mechanised war leads to a famine of skilled engineers.   In war, the firstclaim on the services of engineers is of that person or organisation which        -can use their, rare skill most fully for a national purpose.   With thepossible exception of,the responsible flying duties discussed in paragraph 53,no other claim should stand .against this.   If one branch of the Army can.usethe rare technical skill of a soldier while the branch in which he- happens-tobe cannot use It, the first branch is entitled to claim him.-  If no branch ofthe Army can use him he should be released to another Service or industry.Claims to retain in their present units as operatively vital men otherwisesuitable for transfer should be admitted hardly over, if at all. - .-- v58,   Release      special^oases to industry;:   The last paragraph does not mean:that we conteiflplate &quot;any&quot;&quot; large reTease&quot;of skilled engineers from the Forces toindustry.   Still less is it an argument for what &apos;is sometimes called a&quot;double purpose army&quot;3 for alternation of men between military and industrialservice.   That Is-a different issue, and one on which we express no judgment.Our concern here is only with a particular result, of our enquiries.   Thesehave shown us some mon whose skill is so specialised that, there is littledemand for it. in the Forces but a large unsatisfied demand outside the Forcesfor production of armaments.   They have shown us other men, who for -medicalreasons, can never be full soldiers or airmen but might be full producers inindustry.

Inour Interim Report, v/e emphasised thevital; neeq.. fpr secur-xng the maintenance and repair of. machines of-war in action.Everything that&apos;we .have learned and that experience has taught the world inthe last, three&apos;months, underlines this&apos;emphasis. .. In our Interim Report,,we ;described the .steps taken in the Services to re-muster men for skilled-work,-and their search for talent; , we could, not -judge then how, far these steps.-.were.. successful. The broad result&apos; of our enquiries since the date of -that,-;,.,vreport.: i&apos;s. to show that the success of those efforts has-been less complete; - *- than might, have been.hoped.   This is no reflection on the zeal and abilitywith which those- efforts have, been conducted. &apos; But war is a judgment ofresults, not of zeal or ability or intentions.-&apos;.- If what has been tried, hither-to.has. riot succeeded, there is need and time, and this is the time,;for.stronger measures.   Now is the time to &quot;build our coming mechanical Army, toensure the unfailing efficiency of our aircraft, to maintain unchallengeablethe Navy:,    If in some respects the results of our audit of skilled man-powerin the Forces- are disappointing, in a more important sense they are re-assuring.    Our audit has. brought to light a reservoir of skill and initiativenot yet fully used;    if this reservoir can be diverted to the vital purpose,of maintenance and repair of war machines, the demands on industry for -skilled men to serve, this purpose will be reduced.   There is no hope thatthey can be avoided wholly.
61.   Some withdrawal from industry inevitable; With every possible economy,our fuller &quot;investigations leave unchanged the main conclusion of our InterimReport that an increase in the skilled personnel of the Services isinevitable and that more engineers must be drawn from civilian industry forthe Services.     In relation to the total number of such engineers in industry,the numbers that we have in mind are small, but every one of them represents aloss to production of armaments, unless his loss can be made good either by;introduction of substitutes or by more effective use of labour in industry.62.   Scrutiny of all J^ervice Man Power:   Introduction of substitutes inindustry depends upon the avan.a5TIrSy of a supply of substitutes.   For somepurposes those substitutes can be women, but for other purposes they must bemen.   The limits of dilution in some of our industries are being reached, andthe programme of munitions expansion is being hampered in some places less by ashortage of skilled men than by a shortage of semi-skilled and unskilled menoapable of heavy physical tasks beyong the power of women.    In order to obtainwithout damaging repercussions, the skilled men that they need, the Servicesmust be economical not only of skilled men but of men without special skill .but of good physique.   It is not justifiable in war for a fighting Service touse fit men for clerical or menial work or for anything within the power ofweaker men or. of women.   Nor is the urgent need for economical use - of Serviceman-power confined to the use of fit men.   The shortage in.the supply oflabour in many vital munition centres is not a shortage of fit men or of menonly.   There is a limit to our man-power of all kinds male and female *   Thereis needed a scrutiny of the use of. all man-power in the Services, not ofskilled men only, a scrutiny at least as stringent as that which, we havesought to apply to skilled engineers though it probably cannot be undertakenby the same methods.   Review of all war establishments, in the light- of thegeneral principle that no man power of any kind, v/hether of men or of women,  .may be wasted or used trivially, is an indispensable treasure of war.63.   The Nature of an Audit;   Before concluding this Report we desire toemphasise once &quot;more Wie nature of our enquiry.   The scrutiny which, with thehelp of the Service Departments, we have been able to make of their use ofskilled men has been searching;   its results must by considered with a senseof proportion.   The Service Departments, in adjusting the supply of men toneeds which have shifted continually, as operational programmes, supply ofequipment and other factors were changed, have had problems of organisation &apos;to face which no human wisdom could have solved completely, .; The results ofour examination must be judged with full regard to the nature of theexamination as an audit;   that is to say, with appreciation of the probabilitythat an equal enquiry applied to any other organisation, whether inGovernment or in industry or commerce, would be certain to revealimperfections.   To say this is not to suggest any slackening in the effortswhich the Services have made, and are planning to make, for the mosteconomical use of their man-power.   Economical use of man-power in allfields is imperative,   We say it in- order to avoid placing the results of ourenquiry out of proportion to the achievements which are their background.64.   Answers to Questions:   We conclude by stating the answers which areinvestigation leads us&apos; to give to each of the three questions in our termsof reference.(a) Whether the skilled man power already at the disposal of the Servicesis being used with due economy,and effect.The answer to this for the Navy is &quot;yes&quot;, except in regard to navalreservists, where the measures already taken for transfer of qualified men toSkilled work need to be repeated and reinforced until they achieve success.For the Army the answer is &quot;not yet&quot;;   substantial changes of organisationand machinery are likely to be required in this Service before a differentanswer can be given.     Among the changes suggested in paragraphs 29-42 above weregard as vital the technical review of establishments, the pooling ofmechanical resources, and the reorganisation of selecting, sorting and tradetesting arrangements.   Underlying these, and. a condition of their achievement,is the giving to mechanical and. electrical engineering as distinct from civilengineering its proper place and authority in the higher councils of the Army.For the Air Force the answer is &quot;not yet wholly&quot;.   The machinery forsorting, selection and trade testing should be re-examined and such barriersto transfer as remain should be re-considered.     The existing machinery forreview of establishments should be strengthened to whatever extent is neededto ensure, as far as is humanly possible, that there is no surplus of skilledmen anywhere.
For all three Services the answer to this question is &quot;yes&quot; subject tominor improvements such as are continually being made by the Service Departmentsthemselves;   we have brought   to the notice of these Departments a few points,mainly of detail, arising out of our enquiry.     In the development of newtraining, the Wavy has done less than either of the other Services - perhaps incertain fields too little - but what it does is well integrated to the rest ofits administrationi   Navy technical training is excellent both in selection ofmen and in adjustment of the training to the purpose in view.    The older Armytraining establis.hme.nts v/hich have been seen by us are excellent.     Its newtraining schemes are an improvisation deserving of great praise;   good inthemselves they need to be fitted more closely into the organisation of theArmy as a.whole, with a better selection of trainees and with closer adjustmentto the practical problems which the trainees will have to solve.    Of thetraining schemes of the Air Force we have stated already &quot;that they are equallyimpressive by reason of their scale and by reason of the efficiency with whiohthey are conducted&quot;;   our further investigations give us no ground for modifyingthat judgment,(c) ^ ^HT^^^-J-^SiE1^ dff^tks ^^^9^ l 2?-,5JS3jL S men as recruits toService trades daring &quot;^rporlod^ending 51st March, &quot;19*42,. should in any respectbe modified.As regards the Navy it should be possible to meet 10$ of the demands up to31st March, 1942 by better use of some of the naval reservists.     But substantialadditional numbers will be needed by the Navy, subject only to certain questionsas to programme and the margin for contingencies which we propose to discussin Part II of this Report,As regards the Army, the requirements before us at the time when we madeour Interim Report were extremely small and very few fully skilled men fellto be supplied to the Army under that Report,     In this Report we have toconsider requirements substantially revised and enlarged.     While certainty isimpossible, there is a clear possibility that these revised requirements andeven more can be met from within the Army itself.    While that possibilityremains, there is no case for supplying additional numbers of skilled men tothe Army from outside, though the need to recruit a certain number of highlyskilled men as Armament Artificers may be established.As regards the Air Force our Interim Report made provision for recruitingof skilled&quot; men up to 60$ of substantial requirements.     Since we made thatReport, the questions both of the total numbers of technicians needed, and ofthe dates at which they will be needed, have been affected by new conditions.The question as to the proportion of the total need that can be met by furtheruse of men within the Service cannot yet be answered fully.    We are bound toreserve what we have to say upon these matters to Part II of our Report,We have the honour to beSir,Your obedient Servants,J ,G.R. G.BEVERIDGEBAILEYLITTLESIMPSON31st October, 1941,

CCMMITTSS   OM   SKILLED ; MEN -IN&quot; THE   SERVICES..   -   &quot;, SECOND   REPORT.APPENDIX A:- HEADQUARTERS TNTERVIEYfS WITH MI IN THE FORCES.The 169 men, covered by Headquarters interviews are drawn in roughly equal &apos;proportions from lists furnished by employers (82) and from lists furnished byTrade Unions with-one or two from other sources (87).     Both the.employers&apos; andthe union lists represent in the main industrial classes strongly protected   -against conscription by the Schedule of Reserved-Occupations or by deferment,and for this reason the proportion of men entering the Services as reservists(whether following previous regular service or not) or aa territorials ismaterially larger among the.men interviewed than in the Services as a whole,being nearly 55$ of the -total, &quot;\o* all cases, are volunteers;-  the remainder,are conscribed under the Militia Acts or under the &quot;Army Acts&quot;,.On the basis of the interviews,&apos; the 169 ,men. seen have been grouped in sixclasses, with some, of the classes sub-divided, as-set put in the. scheme of.classification.

(see paragraph 8--of the Report).The six-classes&apos; with subclasses into-which the men have been grouped, areset out below with.explanations.of. the classes:1*    Men now well used because. -&apos;&quot;-&quot;&apos; .(a) Already in a service^Trade,, making full use^ of their-civilian skill, or.&quot;assigned without delay to -training for such a trade.(b) In Servi.ce positions of responsibility greater than any, technical workfor which they are qualified by-civil experience, -Most of the men classed la. (Nos. i-20) were, fully skilled in civil lifethough many needed and received or. are receiving special-technical training inthe Services.    A few semi-skilled men as to -whom early action&apos; for suitable .training has been-taken, are included, oh the assumption that these steps willlead directly to suitable&quot;employment.-   ,Men in whose cases steps for training intheir &quot;trade have been&apos;taken-only after they have been serving for a considerabletime In Class HI. - - In Class ib (Nosi.- 21-25) are a small number, of men whoseuse may equally be regarded as satisfactory.     These, for the most part, are menof moderate civilian skilly ahdj therefore&quot;,&apos; - better used in the&apos; responsibleService positions which they have attained, than in a technical capacity, .
jl-.  &quot;Men sufficiently used, because, -(a) &quot; Not having, any rare civilian skill.,r or   : .(b) Not worth technical training how, though they might have been goodmaterial for such training earlier before they became fully trained inMilitary duties.;, . &apos; - -Class II (Nos, 25-44) in both its sub-sections (a) and. (b) consists inthe main of men possessing, only moderate civilian sld.ll;   it includes also allthose men who for any personal reason (lack of health, education, ability andamenability) seem to be as well used where they are as they would be bytransfer.     The men. in sub-class lib are those who at the outset of theirService careers might have seemed worth training, but who presumably by nowhave attained military experience which it would be a pity to lose.Ill, Men insufficiently used up. to -now, buta in regard to whom action tosecure their better use has already been taken.The men in Glass III (Nos.. 45-57) include both skilled and good semi-,skilled men, all of whom are now&quot; under technical training or expected to be soshortly, but none of whom are yet posted, to trades.    Most of the soldiers inthis class have been in the Army since the outbreak of war, that is. to say,are in process &apos;of transfer to more suitable work only at the end of two years-of service which has not-used their slcill or experience.ivl   Men suitable for training for moreskilled work in the Services, as towhom no. action appears yet to have &quot;been taken.The men in Class IV (Nos, 58-67) are for the most part only semi-skilled&quot;but have experience or aptitudes which clearly mark them out for training toService trades..   Most of them:have attempted to obtain transfers to their owntrades without success hitherto.     Half of them-have been in the Forces sincethe-&quot;outbreak of war,, and the. rest (except for one recently consoribed navalrating) have been in the Forces for more than a year,V\ -&apos;Me.n usefully employed in their Service position but-apparently capable of.    more skilled work for which there is urgent deniahd.. In Class V (Nos.. 68-88) are some of the most valuable men of all.     Nearlyall are fully skilled;   some are&quot; exceptionally skilled, or shew more thannormal intelligence or education.    Most Of these men are already in Service-tirades and are used in them to some extent.     In some cases: failure to use themen more fully appears to be due largely to their own wishes.     But this is asmall minority of the- whole class.     Most express a wish for more importantwork.     There is often a &quot;difference of opinion between them and the Service&apos;authorities as to whether the work on which, they are employed is&apos; sufficiently-difficult to need all&apos; their. slcill or experience, or-is sufficiently continuousto justify retaining them on it, ,  The inclusion of vsuc&apos;h: men in Glass Vimplies. a.-.view that the men have made, out a prima facie case for their betteremployment.     Though this view might be corrected by fuller&apos; information insome cases, in others there is little doubt that fully &quot;skilled men are beingused for &quot;work- within the capacity of ,semi**skilled men -or trainees.     Those menrepresent the -opposite of dilution, - that is to say, employment of skilled mento do work which is normally done by less skilled men,.-VI-   Men of skill for which there is strong unsatisfied demand but which is- not being used in.their Service, position because either -(a).   Though, mustered&apos;in a Service trade suited to their civilian skill theyhave not been working at that trade to any substantial extent, or(b)   They are not mustered in a Service^trade or are mustered wrongly-.Each of the men in Class VI represents definite failure to use in theirpresent Service position industrial qualifications for which there is an urgentunsatisfied demand elsewhere, either in the Services or outside.     Most of themen&apos; in this class - about five out of six - are fully skilled, with
apprenticeship or its equivalent, and in many cases with a&apos;&apos;record ofsubstantial evening study lit technical institutions,&apos; -The remaining;six are^mi-skilled men with&apos;.good experience.     The class is.&quot;divided into twosub-sections:    In Via (Nos. 89-125) are men mustered in an - appropriateService trade, hut, according to the statements made by them, not:working, atthose trades&apos; for more - than a very small proportion of their time, if at all,or hot fusing- their skill to, an appreciable extent.     In Class VIb(Nos, .&apos;126-169) are men who, though. apparently qualified for mustering in a.Service trade, with or without technical training, have not been somustered, or have been mustered in a trade&apos;clearly of less -importance- than isjustified by their civil experience, and as, to whom up to date no effectiveaction for their better use has-been taken.     The distinction between thesetwo sections is of great importance for the. understanding of how skill comesto be lost in the Services. &apos;- . . .The numberical distribution in each of the six classes&apos;of the 169 men--interviewed at Headquarters, taking separately the various Army Corps, &quot;mainlyconcerned,.-and the Navy and tho Air Force is shewn in Table IV&quot;below.\3.

Men insufficiently used up, to now., buta in regard to whom- action tosecure their better use has already.-been taken.The men in Glass III (Nos. 45-57) include both skilled.and good semi-skilled men, all of whom are. new&apos;under technical training or expected to be soshortly, but none of whom are yet posted, to trades.     Most of the soldiers inthis class have been in the Army since the outbreak of war, that is to say,are in. process&apos;of transfer&apos; to more suitable work only at the end of two years-of service which has not used their slcill or experience.IV. Men suitable for training for more skilled work in the Services, as towhom no. action, appears yet to have been taken.The men in Class IV (Nos. 58-67) are for the most part only semi-skilled&quot;but have experience. or aptitudes which clearly mark them out for training toService trades,.    Most of them.have attempted to obtain transfers to their owntrades without success hitherto.     Half of them have been in the Forces sincethe-/outbreak of war,, and the rest (except for one recently conscribed navalrating) have been in the Forces f on more than a year.V. - - Me,n usefully employed in their Service position but apparently capable ofmore skilled work for which there is urgent--demand. .In Class V (Nos. 68-88) are some of the most valuable men of all.     Nearlyall are fully skilled;   some are&quot; exceptionally skilled, or show more thannormal-intelligence or education.     Most of these men are already in Service:trades and are used in them to some extent.     In some cases failure to use themen more fully appears to be due largely to their own wishes.     But this is asmall minority of the- whole class.     Most express a wish for more importantwork.     There is often a difference of opinion between tbem and the Serviceauthorities as to whether the work on which they are employed is sufficiently-difficult to need all their slcill or experience, or. is sufficiently continuousto justify retaining them&apos; on it, ,   The inclusion of .such:men in Glass Vimplies, a.--view that the men have made out a prima facie case for their betteremployment.     Though this view might be corrected by fuller&apos; information insome cases, in others there is&apos; little doubt that fully &quot;skilled men are beingused for work, within the capacity of semi-skilled men-or trainees.     Those menrepresent the -opposite of dilution, that is to say, employment of skilled mento do work which is normally done by less skilled men,:-VI-   Men of skill for which there is strong unsatisfied demand but which is- not being used ,in.their-Service position because either -(a).   Though, mustered In a Service trade suited to their civilian skill theyhave not been working at that trade to any substantial extent, or(h)   They are not mustered in a Service trade or are mustered wrongly.&quot;ii . u   i    i   -  *   i    i m*   in   i -    i i    i    .......i   .ii  I! . i    i   a        i.   w ^nai.   ii       i        r.   i   i .       i   n      iEach of the men in Class VT represents definite failure to use in theirpresent Service position industrial qualifications for which there is an urgentunsatisfied demand elsewhere, either in the Services or outside.     Most of themen in this class - about five out of six - are fully skilled, with
apprenticeship or its equivalent, and in many cases with a. record ofsubstantial evening study at technical institutions.&apos;   The remaining-six are^pmi-skilled men with good experience.     The class is divided into two &apos;sub-sections:   In Via (Hps. 8.9-125) are men mustered in an. appropriate -Service trade, -hut, according to the statements made by them, not working atthose trades&apos; for more then a very small proportion of their time, if at all,or not using, their skill to. an appreciable extent.   , In Class VIb(Nos. 126-169) are men who, though apparently qualified for mustering in aService tro.de, with or without technical training, have not been somustered, or have been mustered in a trade&apos; clearly of less importance than isjustified by their civil experience, and as to whom up to date no effectiveaction for their better use has.been taken.     The distinction between theseteo sections is of great importance for the understanding of how skill coniesto be lost in the Services.  - 1 ; - &apos;&quot;&apos;&apos;The numberical distribution in each of the six classes&quot; of the 169 men --- -interviewed at Headquarters, taking separately the various Army Corps, mainlyconcerned,and the Navy and the Air Force is shown in Table IV &quot;below.\\

Broadlyspeaking men in Class III are assumed to require supervision;   those inClass II are assumed to be able to work without, constant supervision and thosein Class I are assumed to be capable of supervising others.     (Thisclassification has of course no reference to the Committee&apos;s classification byreference to the degree to which men are being used in their present Servicepositions).     The Army Service trades themselves are divided into five groupsfrom A&apos; - E, those in the higher groups being paid more.    Thus a man&apos;sService pay depends both upon the group to which his trade belongs and upon hisclass within that trade,.
The principal engineering and allied trades in the highest group, A,, arethe following:-  Armament Artificer, Artificer R.A. j Electrician,Electrical Fitter, Engine Artificer, Fitter, M.V, (Motor Vehicle), Fitter Gun,Instrument Mechanic, Lineman Mechanic, Millwright, Patternmaker,. Radio Mechanic,Shipwright, Toolmaker, Turner, wireless Mechanic.    This group includes alsoa number of non-engineering trades, such as cook-hospital, printer (variouskinds), pharmacist, trained nurse, railway engine driver, traffic operatorand chemical laboratory assistant.The principal engineering and allied trades in group Bare:-  Armourer,Blacksmith, Boilermaker, Coppersmith, Electrician (Power Station), Electrician(Wireman), Engine Fitter, Fitter Signals, Grinder (Precision), Machinist Metal,Motor Mechanic, Moulder, Panel Beater, Watchmaker.   ; This group includes alsocook, carpenter, and joiner, dispenser, miner, searchlight operator, plumberand quarryman,The principal engineering and allied trades in group C are:?  DriverOperator, Lineman, Rivetter, Tinsmith and &quot;Whitesmith.Driver mechanics are in group D.Air Force^Service Trades.In the Air Force, service trades are arranged in five groups from I - V,according to their skill, all engineering and allied trades being in one ofthe first two groups.     Group I-consists almost entirely .of engineering andallied trades of which the most important are blaeksraith-welder,coppersmith-sheet metal worker, electrician I, fitter I, fitter II, fitter(armourer), fitter, fitter m,t., instrument maker, instrument repairer I,,turner and various forms of radio and wireless mechanics.

All these officers, and those from the D.R.M&apos;sDepartment of the War Off ice, took immense trouble to arrange our visits andfacilitate our enquiries in every way. . The officers of the units visited not .only received us with every courtesy, but went out of their way to provide theclearest possible answers in their power to the questions in which the Committeeis interested.&apos; &apos;        . .&apos;. -4.    Numbers Interviewed.   In all we interviewed about 50 on each of the firstfour visits and about 7.0 on the Scottish tour.  ..Some of these proved to -have, atno time,-possessed that measure of engineering -or allied skill with which theCommittee is concerned.&apos; Finally, 34 from the R.E. , 40 from the R.C.S., 31 fromthe R.A. (AoA.)j 36 from the R.A. (Field), and 46 from the R.A.S.C, i.e. 187 inall, proved relevant to the purposes. of the Committee.5,    Basis of Selection.   The lists&apos;of those.to be seen were, in.the-first place,compiled-by the local Commanders, in response, to-, a request from us in advance thatwe be shown as many as possible, in one day of-those, with engineering and alliedexperience-In civil iifeV  The lists were supplemented by our own selections onthe spot after examining the Nominal Rolls of the units and the attached cards -giving civilian occupations.

In the case of the Station.Interviews,..moreover, the local Commanders, while not present during&apos;the actual- interviews,&apos; were    almost ready for a discussion afterwards&apos;of anypoints that; had - arisen. .10.:   The Evidence Confirmed,   We shewed them and studied with them thereports of the interviews on the two. occasions when the desire for sucha procedure Was expressed.-   We&apos;were reminded on occasion that a man&apos;stemperament may be an obstacle to the full use of skill of. which- theCommanding Officer is&apos;more conscious than the man himself,&apos;   A soldierstated, accurately enough, that he was an electiical engineer employed,-in the cookhouse;   the Commanding Of fleer&apos; inconveniently remembered-the-peccadillo that.explained his presence&apos;there.

Army- Service Corps and the Royal Corps&quot; of Signals; - and nearly aquarter, for the Royal Artillery,  . These proportions are, as weshould expect them to be, less in all &quot;cases than those for theHeadquarters Interviews.     But&apos; they remain very substantial,(b) Placing the four corps in a descending scale according to theirproportion in Class VI one finds them in the same order whetherone looks to the Headquarters or to the Station Interviews. Ineach case the R.E. have easily the largest proportion; then, ineach case, come the R.A,S.C, then the R.Q.S., then the R.A,
(o) The sharp drop in the R.A, proportion in Qlass VI (just over a halfto just under a&apos; quarter) when one passes: frcm the Headquarters to theStation figures rings true to.expectation when observed to springmainly from the results for the A.A. Command - the only Com^id withcontinuous opportunities of engaging the enemy during the last yeareMoreover, a clear appraisement of the R.A.. is somewhat blurred by theinclusion at the Stations of a considerable number of men of verylimited skill whose true potentialities&apos;it was difficult to assess asconfidently as usual,&apos;    If we confine ourselves to skilled menexamined, we obtain a figure of 11 out of 24 in Class VI for theR.A, Station Interview^ as against 13. out of 22 for the HeadquartersInterviews - an understandable relationship,(d) While not immune from weakness in respect of Class VI, the R.A.S.C.Heavy Workshop with nearly three-quarters in Classes I - III presents,in general, a far more encouraging picture than any other corps orsub-division of a corps.     It is noticeable that the R.A.S.C. FieldUnits show little more than a quarter in these &quot;satisfactory&quot; Classes,A major conclusion of the Report (paragraph 11) is reinforced to theeffect that a heavy workshop is almost the only sphere where the Armyfinds it possible to make full use of civilian engineering skill.15,   Harder Fate of the Skilled.    Carrying further the enquiry indicatedabove ^Paragraph 14c) into the fate of the fully skilled as distinct from thesemi-skilLed, etc,,,Table III divides the 187 men interviewed according as towhether they possessed a virtually complete measure of civilian skill or,alternatively, were semi-skilled or little skilled.     It then classifies themunder the headings I - III, IV-V and VL^.according to the use made of theirskill in the Army.TABLE III.Comparison of Skilled with Semi-.or Little Skilled Men.

On the other hand, in Class VI, &quot;theworst of the Classes, the fully skilled show nearly a half of their number,against just over a quarter.     That the Army finds it substantially harderto make full use of a high than of a moderate&apos;degree of civilian skill isvividly demonstrated, - and the lessons of the Headquarters Interviews, oncemore confirmed, &apos;16*   Pre-War and Postv-War Entrants. .   The men interviewed, like the wholeArmy, fall into two main classes in respect of mode of entry.     Those calledup as territorials and reservists or coming in through the militia befoz^ethe outbreak of war may be.described as pre-war entrants, those who have      1entered the Army since the. outbreak &apos;&apos;of. war as conscripts, whether under theMilitia Act or the Army Act, or as volunteers,&apos;;.may be described as post-,war&apos;entrants. &apos;  The suggestion is sometimes made that the main cause ofdifficulty in fitting skilled men in their-proper places relates to theformer class and that the; ppst-war entrants &quot;are better placed.,    Thissuggestion is tested by the figures set cut in Table IV below.

Here and elsewhere the Stationinterviews abounded in illustrations which can be used to suggest thepoints made in the Report, especially those paragraphs 36 - 40 recommendingimproved machinery for posting, trade testing, training, reduction ofbarriers to transfer,, sorting and selection.

A Driver Mechanic mustered into the second class ofhis trade in Autumn, 1939, denied all subsequent chances of upgrading; apress operator mustered as a Fitter but sent instead on a course to trainas a Cook: a skilled Boilersmith who twice &quot;dodged&quot; a trade test in orderto avoid becoming immobilised in an incorrect trades   a highly skilledelectrical fitter who failed on a course for Wireless Mechanic in orderto avoid the loss of stripe and 6d a day that would have followed successin the examination and consequent transfer to the R.A.0.C;   a skilled autocapstan setter employed as a sanitary orderly.     To cases of this kindwhich could be multiplied not, it is true, indefinitely, but
surprisingly often considering the size of the sample, should be addeda general, almost pathetic ignorance among, the men interviewedconcerning A.C,I!s and other well-intentioned measures of the higher        Jauthorities to assist them to remuster. &apos;&apos;,19*   Our Material Interpreted 31sewhere.. ..-  We are faced in the aggregate with a documented collection ofalleged defects far too formidable to be set aside as inevitable freaksof fortune.    But on this, as on other topics, our material has been inthe hands of the Chairman and the Committee while they were draftingthe Report.    There is no need, therefore, to interpret or summarise itfurther.20*   Local Efficiency,   It may be taken as certain that the unitsvisited were of good standard and representative quality,     None of the187 men interviewed offered, on any occasion, any criticism of the  :distribution or the usS of man-power within his unit - a striking fact, ,even making-allowance for military discipline and the fact that anofficer from Headquarters (hut not their own Commanding Officer) was.present.at the interviews.   Nothing that we saw or heard suggested thatthe local Commanders were, in any respect, failing to make the bestpossible use,&apos;from, the point of view of their local, &quot;show&quot;, of the humanmaterial&apos; provided for them.    It is no exception, to this to suggest thattheir emphasis on trade testing.and technical training might., in somecases, have been greater, since from the local standpoint an improvementin a man&apos;s classification might actually result in his being lost to theunit.     Among, many such oases that of a semi-skilled mechanic ernes tomind, a man at last about to become a skilled tradesman (Fitter M.V.)Who could certainly have been converted into one at a much earlier stage.But his unit (whose general efficiency was patent) already had the oneFitter M.V. permitted them by their establishment, would Have lost theman if they had got him upgraded, and saw no reason to expedite a departurethat might, or might not benefit the national-interest but could onlydamage their own.&apos;21.   Outstanding Morale.   The angle of this Appendix has necessarily&quot;been critical..    But seeing that few, If any, -civilians have enjoyedduring the present war such opportunities as. have been of forded us ofcross-examining   individual soldiers in their units and listening tostories of misuse, one may be allowed, in conclusion to pass outside thestrict province of the Committee and respectfully record an abiding&apos; recollection of outstanding morale evident up and down the country amongall ranks of the British Army.&apos; - &apos;&apos;.
