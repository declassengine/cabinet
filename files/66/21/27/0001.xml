H. Campbell to Mr. Eden.(Personal.) Lisbon, January 23, 1942. ;My dear Secretary of State,I CANNOT say how relieved I was when we yesterday reached agreement,after one of the stickiest negotiations it has come my way to take part in.Here in Lisbon it was impossible to lose sight of the origin of the quarrel,,namely, that whilst we were in negotiation regarding the character of the helpto be offered to and accepted by the Portuguese in the event of an attack on Timor(Salazar had consistently refused to negotiate on the basis of the threat of anattack) we suddenly crashed in and violated our ally&apos;s neutrality, although wehad agreed at the outset of the war that it was in the interests of both partiesto the Alliance that Portugal&apos;s neutrality should be preserved a decision whichis at least as valid to-day as it was then. &apos;At the same time we tried to keep in view the other side of the medal-1strategic importance of Timor; inadequacy of the Portuguese power ofdefence, &amp;c.The problem resolved itself into one of balance of advantage, WJe hadctesafeguard our strategic interests in the Far East without endangering ourrelations with Portugal to the point where this would react on our strategicinterests in the Atlantic and North Africa.Up to the time when I left for London there was no indication in anytelegram from the Foreign Office that the matter was being considered fromthis wider as well as from the purely Far Eastern aspect. And, although thecase had been prepared (I think) before I came home, it was only after my arrivalthat it was considered by the Chiefs of Staff, who pronounced in the sense thatthe importance of retaining Allied troops in Timor would not justify, from thepoint of view of the war as a whole, the risk of a rupture of our relations withPortugal.The agreement just reached is in harmony with this decision. Our relationswith Portugal are restored, and for another month at least the Allied forceremains in defence of Portuguese Timor. It is the next chapter (assuming thatno Japanese attack occurs in the meantime) which is causing me some worry. Thetelegrams which I have received since my return would seem to indicate that we11618   [23394]
are attempting to fortify our moral position in case by the time the Portuguesecontingent arrives the situation may have developed in such, a way as to make itundesirable to withdraw the Allied force.If that were really so, I should be the last person to quarrel with the decisionon any ground save that of our general strategic interests. Other things can beput right in course of time. Once again, therefore, the problem will become oneof balance of advantage.This being so, the object of this letter is to let you know that it is my con-sidered opinion that&apos; we should be rash to think that because we succeeded (notwithout considerable difficulty) in solving chapter I we should equally be ableto solve chapter II in a satisfactory manner, if for what might appear to beoverwhelming reasons we refused to withdraw on arrival of the Portuguesecontingent.&quot;We cannot afford to ignore the character of the strange man with whom weare dealing. Despite his undoubted Christian virtues (which incidentally inspirehis abhorrence of Nazi methods), Salazar, as we have seen, is capable of flyinginto a black rage, from which he is slow to recover. Quick to respond to an open-handed gesture, he is bitterly resentful of anything which looks to him like sharppractice. If we gave him cause to feel that we had let him down a second time,I am morally certain that he would either have done with us for good and alland throw himself on the mercy of Germany or (perhaps more probably) throwin his hand and make way for another Government; which, as I explained inLondon, could only result in chaos from which no one but our enemies wouldprofit. Our friends here whether they belong to the category of those whotry to use us for their own ends or to the category of those who are sincerelyand disinterestedly pro-British unite in supporting Salazar whenever he doessomething which they think will keep the war away from Portugal. I am toldthat when the National Assembly was summoned the other day and loud-speakerswere set up in the principal square to broadcast the proceedings,, all the women(incidentally stouter-hearted than the men), who are generally left at home onsuch occasions, insisted on being taken along because they wished to hear Salazarannounce that &quot; it was to be peace! &quot; If it is ever to be war, Salazar is theonly man in Portugal capable of uniting the country behind him.My conclusion, therefore, is that if there is any question of the Allied forcenot being withdrawn when the Portuguese contingent arrives (thereby obligingit to turn round and sail home again) we must carefully consider the consequenceson our wider strategic interests of a definite break with Portugal. If, from thegeneral strategic aspect the local situation is held to be paramount, well and good.But do not let us be deluded into thinking that, having called Dr. Salazar toorder once, we could get away with it a second time. I am quite sure we couldnot.  For one thing his position would be completely untenable.Nor must we forget that the Axis, having failed once to embroil Great Britainand Portugal, may well have another try. I should not be surprised if, justbefore the arrival of the Portuguese contingent, Japanese submarines were againseen in the proximity of Timor.I hope you will forgive me for inflicting you with ail this. I felt bound tomake the position, as I (and incidentally all the senior members of my staff)see it, clear beyond doubt.RONALD CAMPBELL.
