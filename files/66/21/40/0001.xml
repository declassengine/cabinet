t -. 231.TS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERHMEHT) .S E ,0 R E T. :W.P*(U2J 60.^RD, (FEBRUARY. 1942. / COPY NO. 3/: WAR CABINEtVPOST   .WAR   CREDITS   FOR THE FORCES.Further Report from the Committee on Post-War&quot;     &apos;   Credits.1. Attached for convenience of reference is a copy of adraft announcement setting out the additional financial provisionfor members of the Forces and their families and dependants on thelines approved by the War Cabinet at their Meeting on Thursday,22nd January (W.M.(42)  10th Conclusions, Minute 8).2. The Prime Minister has suggested that the post-warcredit proposals should be amended by making the amount to be setaside Is. per day of service instead of 6d., starting from&quot;thesame day as the income tax concession starts&quot; and that the creditshould be alternative and not additional to any war gratuity whichmay be decided upon, the individual having the option qf drawingwhichever is more favourable to him.     These suggestions have beenconsidered by the Committee on Post-War Credits in consultationwith the Service Ministers and the Minister Qf Pensions.3. We, have examined first of all the question of the datefrom which the post-war credit should begin.     The comparisonof the income tax credits is capable of alternative interpretationsIncome tax is payable in respect of the year beginning on the6th April and as income tax credits will accumulate in respect oftax paid for the year beginning 6th April, 1941, it is arguablethat this is the date to which the. Prime Minister&apos;s formula points.But we think that this interpretation rests on a technicalityrather than on reality.     What matters to the individual is notthe nominal income tax year in respect of which he is regarded aspaying his tax, but the time at which he has to make his payments.Weekly wage-earners began to pay over to the Inland Revenue taxfor the year 1941/42, part of which is being credited to them,in January of this year and, therefore, in a real sense theaccumulation by them of repayable income tax began at that date.(For salary earners the corresponding date was November 1941.)4. In considering the question of retrospection we havehad regard to the cost involved^     The additional cost ofretrospection to the 6th April, 194ls in comparison with theproposals as previously approved, would be . 30 millions on thebasis of a credit of 6d. or  60 millions on the basis of a creditof Is.     We doubt whether the additional satisfaction which wouldbe given to the Forces by a decision to go back to last April wouldbe at all commensurate with the very serious additional burdenwhich would be placed upon the tax-payer.     The additional cost .ofretrospection to the 1st January, 1942, instead of the beginning ofApril, 1942, would be  7i millions for a credit of 6d. and  15millions for a credit of Is,

5.        . -   We think that if it in Cc-sli/cd that theanalogy of the income tax arrangements should determine thecommencement date for..the credit for the Forces the dateto be adopted should V: thy 1st Januaryt 191+2,     Wetherefore recommend -that eournco6. We have examined the cost of the proposal that theamount of the credit should be raised to ls-i per day,,     Thecurrent cost of a credit at this, figure will, he  65 millions ayear, rising as the Forces attain their maximum size to perhaps. 80 millions a year.     If the war were to continue for threeyears from now the total post-war liability on a credit of 1/-per day from the 1st January, 19&apos;-!-2, would-be of the order of 250 millions.     As Chancellor of the Exchequer I have advisedthe Committee that in my considered view these are figures ofdangerous size.     The threat of inflation will not cease withthe war, but on the contrary will become more pressing.    Largepayments from public funds will be called for in respect ofwar damage,repayable income tax and repayable excess profitstax; and in addition to,the post-war credit for the Forcesthere will be claims in respect of gratuity and prize money.There is thus grave danger of great increases in purchasingpower at a time when the supply of goods available forconsumption will remain extremely restricted.    - I had felt thatiri spite of all this the amounts involved in the 6d, credit forthe Forces would be of manageable proportions; I am bound toregard the proposal to double them with the- greatest anxiety.7. The Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion does, of course,include a proposal designed to offset the increased cost bymaking any gratuity decided&apos;upon an alternative and not anaddition to the post-war credits     We think, however, that theincrease in the amount of thecredit may make it a matter of greatdifficulty when the time comes to determine upon a gratuity whichat the same time would secure justice for the Forces and becommensurate with the ability of the country at the time tomake further payments to them.     The-proper level at which agratuity based on pay drawn should be fixed must depend entirelyon the length of the war and cannot bo determined in advance.A post-war credit at the rate of Is. per day produces  18.5.0,for each year of service,     Unless a gratuity based on apercentage of pay were granted at a very high level, the greatbulk of the Forces would draw the post-war credit and not thegratuity, i.e.   they would receive a post-war benefit which wouldbe at a flat rate.      If the gratuity exceeded the credit onlyin the case of the higher ranks the Government might be chargedwith granting it only to a favoured few.     We think that theForces as a whole might well prefer that the post-war benefitshould in part be measured on a sliding scale which would takeaccount of proficiency and promotion, &apos;   If this view is correctit would be better to combine a more modest post-war creditwith a gratuity which&apos;would be payable generally as apercentage of pay, rather than to pay a higher credit whichwould be at a flat rate for all those drawing It and whichwould debar them from participation in the gratuity,8. The case for introducing a post-war credit for theForces rests largely on the introduction in the last Budget ofrepayable income tax.     Comparisons may, therefore, be made ,between the amounts credited&apos;to the Forces and those, accumulatingin favour of industrial workers through their payment of tax.The amount of repayable income tax varies very widely byreference both to income and to family responsibilities and itis therefore Impossible to arrive at any real average.     But

the figure of  18,.5oOcl0 a year., which, is now suggested for thesoldier, exceeds the income tax to &quot;be credited to any industrialworker whose earnings are &quot;below  6 per week.     The industrialworker on a wage of  h,10p0do per week will only be creditedwith just over  11 if he is single, and while his credit risesto  15 if he is married, it falls again to  h if he has onechild and to nothing at all (because he pays no tax) if he hasmore than one child.     We think therefore that the  9 creditfor the soldier at the rate of 6d. per day compares not     &apos;!unfavourably with the income tax credits which will be due tothe bulk of industrial workers, while the  18, which is theannual figure for a credit of Is, per day, would be high bycomparison&quot;with the credits of the weekly wage-earner.9, In. our discussions, the following points were alsomade - -(a) The Home Secretary advised us that a formula whichinvolved an option between post-war credit and gratuity.formembers of the xlrrned Forces would, by thus associating the two -payments, almost inevitably lead to a demand on the part of theCivil Defence Services to have a similar option involving incertain cases the payment of gratuity to them.     This is ademand which it is hoped that the scheme as originally approvedwould avoid, since the question of gratuity was to be keptwholly separate from the grant of a post-war credit.(b) The Service Ministers considered that the grant of apost-war credit for other denies and,ratings, amounting to. l8*5.0d* per year, would be likely to lead to a reneweddemand for improved&apos; financial arrangements for officers, eitherin the form of increased pay or allowances or by participationin the scheme for -post-war credits.   &apos; It is true that suchdemands may be made in any event but to nothing like the sameextent and with nothing like the same justification if thepost-war credit is limited to 6d, a day.. (c) It was also the opinion of the Service Ministers that togrant an option as between post-war credit and gratuity would-throw such a burden of work upon the Pay Offices at the end ofthe war (a time when they would be fully occupied in connectionwith demobilisation)  as might cause serious delays in themachinery for payments with consequential discontent among thoseaffected,10, For these reasons the Committee, with the concurrenceof the Service Ministers, agree in recommending that we shouldadhere to the proposals as originally approved by the Cabinet9subject to the adoption of 1st January 19h2 as the date fromwhich the post-war credit should begin to accumulate.(Intld.,)    KcW.(Chairman) ,Treasury Chambers,Great George Street; 3.,v/sl*3rd February, 19U-2,

m- STATEMENT ON SERVICE:PAY AND ALLOWANCES.As was promised before Christmas, His Majesty^.Government have given careful consideration to theremuneration of the Armed Fo._-.ces and have examined the varioussuggestions which at that time were put forward in debate in &apos;this House.   We regard the improved War Service Grants Scheme,which was introduced as recently as last October, as aneffective and flexible instrument for ensuring that, the:families of fighting men shall be guarded against hardship.We have nevertheless decided as a result of our review tomake certain improvements relating both to current conditionsand to post-?/ar needsc     Details of the proposals arecontained in a White Paper which will be available today and -which I would aslc Honc Members to study.There are three proposals designed to meet the wishexpressed in the House for immediate improvement in theposition of those with family responsibilities.     In the firstplace the Government have accepted the suggestion for areduction, at the expense of the Exchequer, of 3s.6d. in thecompulsory allotments from their own pay made by men claimingfamily or dependant&apos;s allowances, thus increasing the totalfamily resources by 3s06dc per week.     The second improvementis an increase in all children&apos;s allowances of ls.Od. per week,per child, and the third a similar increase in the allowancespaid to certain classes of dependant.We have sought, also for the best way of meeting thecriticism that the&apos; fighting man is at a disadvantage bycomparison with the civilian in regard to the&apos; provision whichhe is able to make for the financial needs which he.will haveafter the war.     We have decided to institute a system ofpost-war credits under which a sum of 6d. per day will beset aside for all other ranks and ratings; the sixpences willbe accumulated on behalf of the men and will build up Into aneet- egg which will be made available for use after the warand after discharge from the Forces.We have thus sought to combine immediateimprovements in those cases where family responsibilitiesconstitute a claim for the most sympathetic treatment possiblewith a general provision for the difficult days which may facemany of us when the war is over.      I must warn the House thatthe present and prospective cost of these improvements is heavybut I have no doubt that the aclcied burdens which they mustproduce will be patiently and cheerfully borne0
