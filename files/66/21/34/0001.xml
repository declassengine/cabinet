Expansion of the Armed Forces.(1) The Army in India.AMONGST the recommendations of the Chatfield Committee on IndianDefence, which only left India early in 1939, were the following : (i) That India should maintain, as a contribution to Imperial Defenceoutside India, one division of External Defence Troops.(ii) That in India itself the divisional organisation should be abolished, andthe Army of India be organised on a brigade group basis.(iii) That in order to pay for the modernisation of the Army in India anumber of Indian units should be disbanded, and the number ofBritish units on the Indian establishment reduced.Thus, in the period immediately preceding the outbreak of war, the energiesof the military authorities in India were primarily directed to modernising, but,at the same time, reducing the armed forces in that country.In spite of this the division of external defence troops was dispatchedoverseas (one brigade to Malaya, the remainder to Egypt) before war broke out,and the following is the story of the expansion of the military forces in Indiawhich has since taken place.At the outbreak of war the strength of those forces was 237,500. During thefirst eight months expansion was slow, only some 50,000, including Indianterritorial battalions which were embodied, being added to the pre-war total.This was not due to any lack of energy or zeal on the part of the Indianauthorities, but rather to the fact that no further expansion was authorised byHis Majesty&apos;s Government. The difficulties of equipment would, of course, havebeen formidable.Since May 1940, however, the expansion of the Army in India has been rapid.It has taken place almost entirely in the Indian cadres. Between May 1940 andSeptember 1941 5,200 officers, of whom 1,400 were Indians, were recruited. Therecruitment of other ranks in the same period included about 550,000 Indiansof various i-anks and kinds. On the 1st October, 1941, the strength of the Armyhad reached a total of [&quot;20,000. The monthly intake is now running at at least50,000, and the recruitment of technical categories, which were practically non-existent before the war, has reached a level of over 9,000 a month.This expansion has not been limited to British India. The Rulers of theIndian States have all been most eager to contribute to the full extent of theirpower, and all possible advantage has been taken of their generous offers.   Units[23396] B
of the Indian States forces have been expanded, trained, and employed to theutmost possible extent, not only to relieve regular forces for service overseas butto serve overseas themselves. By August 1941 17 units of the States Forces wereserving in Egypt, East Africa, Iraq, and Malaya. Cavalry regiments from theStates are being mechanised, and artillery and engineer units are also playingtheir part.r After referring to the contribution of the Indian States, mention may bemade of the generous loan by our Ally, the Maharajah of Nepal, of eight battalionsof the Nepalese Army. These units were lent for service in India only, with thepurpose of releasing units of the Indian Army for service elsewhere; but thefulfilment of this very useful purpose has of course imposed on India theadditional task of equipping them, providing British officers, and training themfor co-operation with Indian Army formations.While the expansion recorded above was being carried out, there has been asteady flow of Indian formations and units overseas. By next month these forceswill total 264,000 officers and other ranks in various theatres. This total includes20,000 in Middle East, 91,000 in Iraq, 56,000 in Malaya and 20,000 in Burma.In terms of divisions there are to-day nine Indian divisions overseas, and, inaddition, the equivalent of at least two divisions in ancillary troops, such as supplyand labour units, sent piecemeal at the requests of Commanders-in-Chief overseasto serve their forces as a whole. Indian troops have fought, and in some casesstill are fighting, in France, Libya, Syria, East Africa, including ItalianSomaliland, Iraq, Persia, Malaya, Burma and Hong Kong.: In addition, Indian troops form part of the garrison of England, Aden,Ceylon and the Seychelles. India, too, is responding nobly to Burma&apos;s urgentrequest for reinforcements in her present hour of need, and the figures I havegiven in respect of this theatre already look like being exceeded.The plan for expansion in 1942 is to replace with various additions thedivisions formed in 1941, in order that these may be freed for service overseas.The execution of this plan depends largely upon the provision of the necessaryBritish personnel, and, if it can be carried out, the total strength of the IndianArmy would amount by the end of 1942 to approximately one-and-three-quartermillions. The latest proposals include an air-borne division, containing aparachute brigade, and an air-borne brigade as well as one heavy armouredbrigade.There is a vast reservoir of man-power; but the difficulties of utilising it,apart from those connected with equipment and training, are the complicationswhich arise from differences of race (which carry with them considerabledifferences in military qualities), caste, language, religion and custom. Inorder that these difficulties might be reduced to a minimum the field of recruit-ment before the war was comparatively small, but it has since been greatlybroadened. The response from practically all communities is highly encouragingand voluntary offers of service are much greater than can possibly be accepted.The Indian recruit a peasant drawn for the most part from the depths of thecountry, where modern mechanised civilisation is unknown- is being successfullyconverted into an efficient, up-to-date soldier, capable of using the complicatedapparatus of modern warfare.The problem of obtaining a sufficient number of officers is, however, veryserious. Compulsory service for European British subjects in India wasintroduced in July 1940, and approximately 4,600 were called upon to serve inVarious capacities. The limit of the possibility of getting more European recruitsfor the officer ranks in India has practically been reached. The intake of Indiancommissioned officers is being increased by every possible means and it is hopedto raise the figure from 900 a year six months ago to 2,000 a year in the nearfuture. To supplement the local sources of supply a number of European officersmust be obtained from the United Kingdom. It is only in India that unlimitedsources of man-power still exist, but these cannot be utilised without a supply ofofficers of suitable types and in sufficient numbers. The War Office have recentlystated that it is their object to further in every way the expansion of the Indianmilitary forces, and that only by this means can requirements for the Middle East,Iraq, Persia, Malaya, &amp;c, be met. But unfortunately the situation at present isthat expansion is held up by lack of officers (and a shortage of British N.C.O.Instructors for engineers, signals and ordnance is contributing to the same result).Moreover, it is reported that much of the material in a draft which has recently
arrived in India is most unsatisfactory, and in the majority of cases unlikely tdreach the standards required for successful command. It is well-known that withofficers of the right type, Indian troops are second to none, but that without themthey can be indifferent fighting material. The possibilities of Canada are beinginvestigated, and British forces in the Middle East must undoubtedly contain anumber of suitable candidates who should, in my opinion, be utilised.Special anxiety is felt in regard to the supply of medical officers. The totalnumber of medioal practitioners is only some 14,000 in the whole of India. Moreof these have already been recruited than in the whole of the war from 1914 to1918 and it is doubtful whether the number still available for military service,if minimum civilian requirements are to be satisfied, is large. It has recentlybeen agreed that medioal officers should be supplied from this country at tlhe rateof 30 a month for the Indian Medical Service and the same number for theR.A.M.C. This is less than the Government of India&apos;s estimate of their require-ments; but if the supply can be maintained at this level it is hoped that it canbe made to serve for essential purposes. ;(2) Training and Equipment.India has invariably been better than her promises in meeting demands forthe despatch of troops overseas well before the dates by which it had beenundertaken that they would be ready, notwithstanding grave shortages of equip-ment, such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons in particular, and the difficultyof completing training in the absence of such equipment. This has onlybeen accomplished by the most strenuous efforts on the part of staffs and units, thesupply organisation and the railways, and by the use of every expedient andimprovisation during training. The result of lack of equipment has been thatunits have only received sufficient weapons, by no means the full scale, afterorders to proceed overseas have been issued.&quot; In providing under prevailingconditions the forces that have already been provided, India has overcome mostserious handicaps and has accepted grave risks. \The deficiencies which need to be particularly emphasised at present areaircraft, anti-aircraft weapons, anti-tank weapons, armoured fighting vehicles(there are trained Indian regiments but no tanks for them) and wireless sets andsignal equipment generally. !(3) Royal Indian Navy.In September 1939 the Royal Indian Navy consisted of 5 sloops and 3 othervessels. Its personnel amounted to 172 officers, 1,483 ratings. The strength ofthis Service by October 1941 amounted to 650 officers and 6,590 ratings, and theService contains 7 sloops and 36 other vessels for mine-sweeping and anti-submarine work.In 1942-43 the Royal Indian Navy will possess 8 modern sloops, 6 old sloopsand trawlers, 88 mine-sweeping and anti-submarine vessels and some other smallcraft. The personnel will amount to 1,005 officers and 10,500 ratings. It will,I think, be admitted that this is a most creditable achievement in view of themany difficulties involved. -.;(4) Indian Air Force.Prior to 1939 the Air Forces in India consisted of 8 R.A.F. squadrons and1 squadron of the recently instituted Indian Air Force. The Chatfield Committeerecommended the maintenance by India of 10 squadrons and 5 volunteer flightsfor coast defence. The outbreak of war prevented the full implementing of theseproposals, and out of the total of 96 Blenheim Bombers which were to be suppliedby His Majesty&apos;s Government only 61 were received. The majority of these arenow out of India. India is dependent on the United States and United Kingdomfor aircraft and aeronautical stores. She has hitherto been low in the order ofpriority for deliveries. This has decisively limited expansion. As regardspersonnel, only a small number can be recruited for the Indian Air Force in India.Quantitatively there is no lack of material for the Indian Air Force, but thenumbers possessing the necessary educational qualifications and technical abilityand who are suitable in other respects are not very large. In spite of alldifficulties, and in particular of the grave shortage of equipment and instructionalstaff, tlhe Indian Air Force is being expanded to form a total of 10 squadrons.[23396] b 2
(At present 3 have already been formed in addition to the 1 existing pre-war.)Volunteer Coast Defence Flights have been embodied and it is intended to expandthem into 6 squadrons by October 1942.II. Supply and Munitions.The advantages of India&apos;s geographical position and the desirability ofexploiting her manufacturing capacity were not sufficiently realised by HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the early stages of the war. Up to the end of 1940 theload placed upon India was relatively small and the expansion of supply on abig scale really only began with 1941. Since then it has been a struggle to catchup with lost time. Simultaneously with the tour of the Roger Mission (which isreferred to later), that is, in the autumn of 1940, the Eastern Group Conferencewas, on the well-conceived initiative of the Viceroy, held in India, and as anoutcome of that the Eastern Group Council system was established, and a CentralProvision Office for the whole area east and south of Suez was set up in Indiawith highly satisfactory results. What was realised and accepted as being-necessary 12 months ago is rendered doubly necessary by the development of thewar in the Middle East and by its more recent extension to the Far East. Thisis clearly recognised in a telegram sent by the Ministry of Supply to the EasternGroup Supply Council on the 11th December, which states that the Ministry iscounting upon all Eastern Group countries to intensify their production fromexisting sources to the utmost, and enquires what additional materials and com-ponents are required for this purpose. &apos;&apos; Let us know your difficulties and thoseof individual Group countries. The sooner we know them the better able we shallbe to help them.&apos;&apos; Meanwhile, between April and October 1941 over 50 per cent,of the orders placed by the Eastern Group Supply Council on Eastern Groupcountries were placed in India; and since the entry of Japan into the war theCouncil have informed the Government of India that demands upon India willbe increased by orders which Australia, and New Zealand may now be unable tofulfil, by orders originally placed on Hong Kong, by fresh demands owing to theincrease of military strength in the Group area, and by fresh demands owing tothe building up of new reserves. The demands which the Council places uponIndia are, of course, additional to the requirements of India to be met out ofIndian resources and represent the needs of the other countries belonging to theGroup. The present extent of India&apos;s war production is illustrated by the factthat war orders valued at nearly  3 million were placed during the week endingthe 3rd January.General Supplies.Industrial areas in India are comparatively few, namely, those groupedaround Calcutta, Bombay, Ahmedabad and Cawnpore, and the development ofproductive capacity has been one-sided. But the capacity for the production ofgeneral stores and clothing is considerable. The jute and cotton textile industriesare well known, and the woollen textile industry, though very much smaller, ismaking a useful contribution. There is also a serviceable leather industry.Taking the country as a whole, there are many concerns capable of supplying thethousands of miscellaneous articles required by the Army, and, although the entirefield has not yet been covered, very satisfactory progress has been made.Few new industries have been started, though there are exceptions in thecase of aircraft on a small scale, aluminium and the production of bichromatesand bleaching powder. It has mainly been a case of expanding and adaptingexisting industrial establishments. Arrangements have, for example, been madefor a large development of the output of motor tyres. The Government of Indiaare of opinion that the case for the deliberate stimulation of selected industries isnow strong, but this can only be done with the active assistance of the UnitedKingdom. Examples which are under consideration are the production of spelterand nickel and the manufacture of tinplate, small tools and general purposemachine tools.The aircraft factory at Bangalore, established by co-operation between theGovernment of India, the Government of Mysore, certain Indian industrialinterests and American aircraft technicians, will be valuable not only for theaircraft it produces, but also for the repair facilities it will afford.  It is manu-
facturing a small number of gliders for the Government of India, and theMinistry of Aircraft Production have placed an order for 400 large gliders withthe great Indian firm of Tatas, and I understand that the order may be doubled.With commendable er?ergy the Indian authorities have started the manufactureof parachutes, for which it is hoped that suitable Indian material will be largelyavailable, and personnel are being trained in their use.The following are a few examples to illustrate the increase of output: Thesteel industry, which was in its infancy in 1914, was producing at the annualrate of 750,000 tons in 1939 and its production will shortly have risen to1,250,000 tons a year. Another 300,000 to 400,000 tons is possible, but thiswould need time as well as plant and possibly other assistance from outside.Moreover, it would absorb pig-iron, upon which the United Kingdom industry isdependent. This proposition is still being examined, but its advantages are notyet by any means established. In addition to the increase in the quantity ofsteel produced an advance has also been achieved in respect of quality andvariety, e.g., armour plate and alloy steels. Garments for the use of the Armywere being produced at the rate of 75,000 a month before the war, and thecorresponding figure in September last was over 7 million and is even larger now;during the last war the highest output in any one month was 2 million, and theoutput for 1941-42 will exceed the total output during the whole of the last warby 50 per cent. The total output of leather goods will have risen from 3 million worth in 1940-41 to  14^ million in 1941-42. Three and three-quarter million pairs of Army boots had been produced to the end of June 1941.As to textiles, compared with an annual value of Government purchasesamounting to about  2 million before the war, the purchases from the outbreakof war up to June 1941 were  43,500,000 worth. Important developments havetaken place in the production of medical stores, and the value supplied from theoutbreak of war to the end of June 1941 was more than 10 times as much as thestocks held on the outbreak of war, and more than 20 times the normal supply tomilitary hospitals. Sixty per cent, of the medical stores items for the Army arenow manufactured in India, compared with only 25 per cent, before the war.I hope it may be assumed that no effort will be spared on the part of theappropriate authorities in the United Kingdom to assist and encourage to thefullest possible extent all well-considered plans for the furtherance of the wareffort in India of the nature referred to in this part of my memorandum. Fulladvantage is, of course, being taken of American resources, and an IndianPurchasing Mission has been set up in the United States of America.Munitions.Before the war there were six ordnance factories engaged upon the outputof munitions proper in India. One additional factory for the manufacture ofhigh explosives has been set up since 1939 and is now coming into production.The standards necessary for munitions work have been difficult to secure outsidethe ordnance factories. But progress has been made, and at present some 200trade and 20 railway workshops are engaged upon munitions work.The production schemes approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government in August1939 on the recommendations of Lord Chatfield&apos;s Committee are now beingbrought to fruition in spite of considerable, though no doubt inevitable, delays.These schemes were based upon a very limited conception of the role of India ina European war, and it was not until after the fall of France that the need for awider outlook was appreciated. The Roger Mission, which was sent to Indiain the late summer of 1940. recommended twenty-one projects, of which nineteenwere eventually approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government in a modified and reducedform, in accordance with the general co-ordination of Empire supplies policy andsubject to the restrictive factor of stringency in regard to the supply of plant andd  personnel.The plant for the Chatfield projects is now practically completed, and theposition in regard to the supply of machine tools for the Roger Mission projectsis reasonably satisfactory, but the supply of jigs, tools, fixings and gauges givesrise to some anxiety. The chief anxiety, however, relates to the supply of alimited but indispensable number of skilled supervisory personnel, both of themanager and of the foreman classes, and this is a matter of very serious concern.Strenuous and successful efforts have been made in India to overcome thedeficiency of skilled labour.   At an early stage in the war far-reaching plans
were made by the Government of India to remedy this shortage, and these arenow coming to fruition, with the assistance of instructors sent to India by theMinistry of Labour, who have also supplemented the measures in India byaccepting small parties of Indian workers (the &quot; Bevin ^Boys &quot;) for trainingin this country. Before the outbreak of war the number of officers of themanagerial class employed in the Indian ordnance factories was 51. It is now117 and will ultimately be 169. Men of the foreman class were 350, are nowabout 1,000, and will be about 1,500. Skilled and semi-skilled labour has risenfrom 15,000 to about 30,000 and will ultimately be in the neighbourhood of 45,000.But in order that these forces may operate effectively, assistance from the UnitedKingdom is needed. The requirements estimated by the Roger Mission weredrastically reduced to the lowest possible level in view of the acute stringencyprevailing here. It was eventually agreed by the Ministry of Supply to fix theserequirements at 10 for the managerial class and 125 for the foreman class, someof whom would not be needed until the middle of 1942. Unexpected obstaclesto their supply have, however, arisen, and the programme is seriously behindhand.The Government of India state that the problem of technical personnel is nowreally acute, and they consider that it is not sufficiently appreciated in the UnitedKingdom. The factories for which these men are required are not only anintegral part of the war effort in the Eastern Empire, but they are actuallyfinanced and owned by His Majesty&apos;s Government, at whose expense plant andmachinery are in process of being supplied. It is inconceivable that thisexpenditure of money and material should be allowed to run to waste for lackof a comparatively small number of essential supervisors whom His Majesty&apos;sGovernment undertook the obligation to supply when they approved the outcomeof the Roger Mission some 9 months ago. A considerable number of volunteersfor these posts have sent their names in, but in many cases their present employersrefuse to release them unless assured of the definite desire of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that they should be released.Conclusion.I hope it will be clear from what has been said that the Indian authoritieshave been strenuously engaged upon efficient and comprehensive efforts, bothin regard to personnel and equipment, to overcome the disadvantage of a latestart, for which they themselves, to say the least of it, were not wholly responsible.There is no part of the Empire in which there still remains a greater possibilityof bringing hitherto unutilised resources of man-power and material to bearupon the war effort, and the factors of geography and strategy increasinglyemphasise the need for doing so. Some assistance from outside is needed ifsuccess is to be achieved, and it is emphatically a case in which that assistance,even though it may be ill spared, will bring in a good dividend by mobilisingforces that would otherwise fail to make their full contribution to the generalcause.So,far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the assistance which is chieflyand vitally needed at the moment is in regard to personnel (a) Officers and other British military personnel for the military forces; and(b) Managers and foremen for the ordnance factories.I hope that, with the approval of the War Cabinet, I shall have the fullsupport and assistance of those of my colleagues who are concerned with thesetwo matters.L. S. A.India Office, January 30, 1942.
