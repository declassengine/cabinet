THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (3&quot;2) 33.January 22, 1942. -WAR CABINET.RELATIONS WITH AUSTRALIA.Note by the Secretary.,, BY direction of the Prime Minister, I circulate to the War Cabinet a minuteby the, Secretary qf State, ,for Dominion Affairs covering two telegrams fronjtSir Ronald Cross, the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Australia.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES, Secretary.Great George Street] S. W. 1,January 22, 1942.Prime Minister. ---- ! :u i.     . // a-I think you should see the two telegrams herewith which I have receivedfrom Sir Ronald Cross. &apos;He makes two main points in these telegrams (!) His own position in Australia.(2) He advocates that if the present tendency in Australia continues w&amp;should counter with an unaccommodating attitude on financial andeconomic questions.1, Sir,-Ronald; Cross&apos; suggestion that, as a, quid (pro, quo for Australianrepresentation in the War Cabinet here j we should demand that he should beinvited to attend in an Australian council is one which, we have, alreadyconsidered here. The conclusion I reached was that on balance it would heinadvisable to put this forward as a condition qf meeting Australia&apos;s requestfor closer liaison here: But if we agree to meet the Australian request it should,I think, be possible later to secure a better position for Sir Ronald Cross inAustralia, an4.1.will keep.jthis-in mind.     ,,,,, ,      . ,,. ^ . .:,1. A subsidiary matter raised in, this connection by Sir Ronald Cross is tjiat-he is not allowed to see the personal and private telegrams exchanged betweenyourself and Mr. Curtin. You will remember that it was your own wish thatneither Sir Ronald Cross nor Mr. Bruce here should see these telegrams, which^ere intended; to be of a very persona,! nature, Lately these telegrams havetended to, be used from the Australian end for messages of an official, but verysecret nature. There is something to be said, for Sir Ronald Cross&apos; view thatKis utilijy is impaired owing to the information contained in these telegramshpjt being available to him. On the other hand, it is clear that if we asktyfr. Curtin tb show.them to him we could&apos;not resist a similar request fromMr. Curtin that they should be shown to Mr. Bruce here. Would you let meknow your wishes ?,2. I am satisfied that any attempt on our part to use economic or financialpressure against Australia would do riO good&apos; at aill. It would merely exasperatethe Australian Government- and give further stimulus to &quot;their tendency to lookto the United States for help.   So far from promoting their co-operation with[23374]
us and strengthening those elements in Australia which are genuinely anxious tostrengthen the ties between the two countries, it would have exactly the oppositeeffect. I do not, therefore, share Sir Ronald Cross&apos;s outlook on this, and I wouldpropose to explain my view to him.If you will indicate whether you are in agreement with the above and whatyour wishes are as regards showing to Sir Ronald Cross the personal telegramsbetween yourself and Mr. Curtin, I will telegraph to him accordingly.CRANBORNE.January 22, 1942.Telegram from the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Australia to theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs.(No. 53.   Secret and Personal.) (Received 1-10 a.m., 21.1.42.)MY telegram of 8th January, No. 21.United Kingdom Government relations with the Commonwealth Governmenthave been always conditioned by the assumption that the Commonwealth Govern-ment shared the spirit of Imperial partnership. At present, the CommonwealthGovernment are ignoring the obligations of that spirit. The propagation of aNationalist outlook and abuse of United Kingdom authorities, including theGovernment, persists unabated in certain newspapers possessing a wide circula-tidn. I am satisfied that the campaign is inspired and conducted by Ministers.It is, moreover, frequently implied in these press articles that they represent theattitude of the Commonwealth Government. The Government, at any rate, havedone nothing to dissociate themselves from the campaign. I do not suspectCurtin of taking an active part and have always found him reasonable. It is,however, increasingly clear that Curtin fails to resist his left-wing leader Evatt,and he probably cannot do so. The result is that Nationalist Evatt, in fact,directs external policy and has an important influence on Government policy asa whole. Further, I believe him to be the guiding voice, or at least the heaviestinfluence, in Ministerial instigation of the press campaign. He has recently beendeeply involved in the reorganisation of the Department of Information.The time has come to collect all our weapons and to fight for British prestigein Australia. Apart from this immediate situation, it is my view, after sixmonths&apos; experience, that a stiffer attitude on the part of the United KingdomGovernment is normally necessary to maintain balanced relations between the twocountries, and, in particular, that the position of the United Kingdom HighCommissioner must be strengthened. ff^ 3. In these circumstances, I make the following submission as to steps tobe taken : There are two distinct though related requirements. The first is tobring to an end, or at least to secure an abatement of, the virulent anti-UnitedKingdom press campaign. I propose at the earliest moment to speak on thissubject in a friendly manner with Curtin, expressing my personal anxiety abouta press attitude which, if continued, must obviously in time detrimentally affectrelations between our countries and which, moreover, is destructive of publicconfidence in the Imperial partnership and in our joint efforts at a time whensuch confidence is essential to our maximum resistance against the Japanese. Ipropose also to refer to enemy propaganda material thus supplied. I shall-explore and report.4. The second requirement in my submission is to develop means ofemploying as may be required a stiffer attitude towards the CommonwealthGovernment. First, it can be of real importance to invest the office of the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner with means of acquiring and maintaining a statuswhich will command the wholesome respect of Ministers and officials. Thisinfluence appears at present to be subservient if not entirely Lacking. Secondly,to develop means of making the displeasure of the United Kingdom Governmentfelt as from time to time may be desirable.5. As to the former, the authority of my position is much weakened by theincreasing tendency to conduct all important negotiations in London or elsewhere,e.g., Washington, of many of which, indeed, I have no knowledge, and on which
Telegram from the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Australia to theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs.(No. 59. Most Secret and Personal.Immediate.) (Received 6-35 a.m., 20.1.42.)YOUR telegram No. 45 of 17th January.In considering affording Australia increased representation in London, youwill no doubt have in mind the possibility of requiring reciprocity here. Onreceiving information of the machinery you contemplate, I may have specificsuggestions to make.2. In any case, I regard it as desirable that this opportunity should, ifpossible, be taken of showing that the United Kingdom concessions involveAustralian obligations.3. I should regard it as important to make it clear to the CommonwealthGovernment that, if improvements are to be made in the machinery of collabora-tion in London, closer collaboration is also required in Canberra, and that anynew arrangements in London should, if possible, be paralleled here.I therefore cannot comment nor can I refer to them in conversation. It will beappreciated that it is difficult, if not impossible, to carry on (? corrupt group)with a Government that knows that in most matters &quot;of negotiation they canand do by-pass me and centre the work in London and that, whilst on rare:,occasions I may have representations to make to the Prime Minister, there isordinarily no need to reckon with me. If I and my office are to function efficiently,we must know all that is going on between our countries, and be in a position to &apos;reveal to Ministers and officials that we do know. We have then the possibilityof making them feel they have got to take account of the attitude I may adopt,and advice I may give to my Government. It is also desirable that they shouldhave a misgiving that, if they are disobliging in one matter, I may cause theUnited Kingdom Government to be disobliging in another.6. Further, my status with the Prime Minister is weakened by myexclusion from knowledge of the contents of certain telegrams of first importance,passing between the Prime Ministers. I urge very strongly that I, chosen asHigh Commissioner from among Ministers of Cabinet rank, as a matter of special ,importance for the duration of the war, must, if I am to appear to enjoy myPrime Ministers confidence, be informed of the contents of these special messages.This matter is more important, because shortly after arriving here an attemptwas made by officials to withhold from me such of your outward and inwardtelegrams as they deemed to be of special secrecy, the hint being used to Fadden,and later to Curtin in my presence, that I was debarred from the knowledge ofthe special telegrams in question. I have had considerable difficulty and thematter is only now in sight of rectification.7. Parallel to these recommendations, I urge that any negotiations of acommercial or financial character should be brought within, and related generallyto political relations with Australia (corrupt group) to a greater extent than isthe case at present. Thus, for example, we should prove unaccommodating onevery possible front at the time when the Commonwealth Government was failingadequately to repudiate an anti-United Kingdom press. The United KingdomHigh Commissioner and Senior Trade Commissioner would need to be kept insufficient touch with these developments to enable them and their officers to knowwhat line to&apos; take in conversation with ministers and officials and to send homecomments. This would be a further reinforcement to (corrupt group ? &quot; my &quot;)authority.8. I am fully aware that the above raises very delicate issues, but I reviewthe tendencies here at the moment as of so serious a character as to demanddiplomatic treatment. It cannot be denied that the conduct of the presentGovernment amounts to an effort to divert national outlook from its traditionalconfidence in the United Kingdom. This, unless prompt counter measures aretaken, may be productive of lasting and serious results.
4. Apart from the foregoing reasons, the. Common wealth Governmentappear to have no understanding of the use they should or would be. well advised(.? to make) of. the Office of the High Commissioner for the, United Kingdom,They embark upon correspondence with the United Kingdom Government onn^atter&amp;pn which time and trouble would .bq,saved were they first to consult m^and obtain my reactions. There are a)so occasions when a partial, understandingof United Kingdom telegrams or despatches, might be clarified by the background^hjclj the High Commissioner for the United Kingdom could provide! Manyexamples could be quoted.5. I therefore regard it as-most., important that any agreed statement thatmay be made as to improved machinery in London should include-, a;referenceto High Conunis^ioner for; the United Kingdom in Canberra and his functions.&apos;: . 6. As a further feature of any machinery of collaboration, I hope the;PrimeMinisteriwill.be informed that in future Winch telegrams will be&apos; repeated tome, and he will: be asked to supply me with copies of his similar telegrams-seemy telegram No-. 53 Of 20th January. If the United Kingdom telegrams are toreach me promptly, it is better that they be repeated to: me; there is otherwiseserious risk of their only reaching me after considerable delay.
