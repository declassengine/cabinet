(-42) 23.January 12, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE LEASE-LEND AGREEMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.THE American State Department, inspired by Mr. Cordell HulFs economictheories, are insisting that we should pledge ourselves, here and now, to theeventual abolition of Imperial Preference. This is an issue which does not allowof ambiguity or equivocation. Article VII of the Lease-Lend Agreement willhave to be explained both in Congress and in Parliament, and the answers given,here and across the Atlantic, as to whether it does or does not mean the end ofImperial Preference as an integral part of our national economic policy, willhave to correspond.2. We are not, of course, being asked, avowedly, that, as a quid fro quo forAmerican material assistance in what is now in the fullest sense their own war,we should sacrifice our interests and the future development and unity of theBritish Empire. The suggestion is that we should only be playing our part inbringing about a new economic world order which will contribute to the prosperityand peace of the world. More than that, Lord Halifax argues that, if only wewill please the present State Department, future United States administrationswill not only pursue Mr. Hull&apos;s economic policies but join us in &quot; policing thepeace of the world.&quot;3. The new economic world of which Mr. Cordell Hull dreams is the laisser-faire individualist-capitalist internationalism which was the accepted ideal, andin large measure the actual practice, of the last century. It was a world inwhich the individual capitalist was free to buy, sell or invest as suited him best,regardless of national security or the permanent welfare of the particular com-munity of which he might be a member. The perfection of the theory might besomewhat marred by such reactionary manifestations of &apos;&apos; economic nationalism &apos;&apos;as tariffs. But, at any rate, the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause, if it could notprevent a tariff &apos;&apos; discriminating&apos;&apos; between the citizens of a particular countryand foreigners, at any rate prevented any discrimination between foreigners.The underlying assumption throughout was that there are no national interestsconcerned in international trade, only individual interests.4. The world has been moving away, for good and all, from that assumption.Economic nationalism, in one form or another, whether for defence, or for socialwelfare, was a steadily growing force even before the last war. That war andits sequel gave it an impetus which has been immensely enhanced by the presentwar in all countries. The immediately post-war period is bound every where[23337]
to be one of rigid control of trade. Afterwards there may be hopes of modnymgthis situation, more particularly by the definite co-operation of individual nationsor groups of nations. Some sort of European &quot; New Order &quot; based on inter-European economic preference by free mutual agreement as distinct fromHitler &apos;s New Order based on domination and exploitation would seem, indeed,to be an essential condition for the restoration of the prosperity and futurestability of Europe. But there is nothing to suggest that Europe, or the world, isever going to return to the economics of the last century, even if such a returnsuited American export interests.5. As for the Americans, the Japanese attack has made them foi the timebeing a united nation. But the reaction against the Roosevelt policies andtowards isolation is bound to come after the war, as after the last war. TheUnited States are no more likely to busy themselves actively with the policingof the world&apos;s peace in partnership with ourselves than they were to undertakethe much lighter commitments involved in membership of the League of Nations.Nor will the abandonment by us of Imperial Preference, prevent any temporarylowering of the American tariff being promptly reversed by the next Republicanmajority.6. In any case, dealing with the matter, as we must, from the point of viewof our own future, it is a mistake to assume that the lowering of the Americantariff, or of world tariffs generally, offers so attractive a prospect for this country.We are far too apt to continue thinking of ourselves as what we were fifty yearsago, the world&apos;s cheapest manufacturers, only asking for equal terms in orderto beat all competitors. We had much better face the fact that with the ever-increasing diffusion of technical efficiency we, with our heavy burden of taxationand our high standards of living, are bound to be more and more overtaken bycompetitors, European or Asiatic, with lower standards or by those who, likethe Americans, can afford to dump the surplus of their mass production for animmense home market. ;. 7. What we shall have to rely on increasingly for our export trade is, notpromiscuous world competition, but markets in which by special negotiation, andgetting away as far as we can from the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause, we securedefinite concessions for ourselves in return for definite counter-concessions. Above,all, we shall have to rely increasingly on the markets of the Empire, where,behind and above any immediate bargaining advantages, lies the sense of acommon interest in each other&apos;s welfare and material strength.8. The extent to which that process has already been going on during thelast half-century is, I think, little realised. The proportion of our total domesticexports which go to Empire countries rose from 32-42 per cent, in 1900 to34-22 per cent, in 1910, 37-55 per cent, in 1920, 43-5 per cent, in 1930 and49-85 per cent, in 1938. Nor is it possible to dissociate that growth from thepreferences granted unilaterally by the Dominions during the three decadespreceding Ottawa or from the fuller policy of reciprocal preference inauguratedat Ottawa.9. To judge of the national value of a trade merely by quantitative exportfigures is, however, very misleading. The value to us, as a nation, of externaltrade lies not in its volume, but in its character. The only truly nation-buildingtrades for us are those by which we secure the raw materials and food-stuffs whichwe lack by exporting a portion of our surplus manufacturing capacity. Fromthat point of view Empire trade is essentially nation-building, in so far as theexport half of it consists mainly of finished manufactures and the import halfof it mainly of raw materials and food-stuffs. It is, consequently, of far greatervaiue than a corresponding volume of, say, European trade in which we buy backas much, or even more, manufactures than we sell.10. I have written this, not to revive old fiscal controversies, but becauseit is precisely from that point of view that1 we shall be forced by sheer necessityto envisage our external trade after the war. With the loss of the bulk of ourforeign investments, much of our insurance, shipping and other sources of&quot; invisible export,&quot; we shall be obliged, in order to revive our industries and feedour people, to resort to a very drastic rationing, whether by tariff or otherwise;: ofall imports that are not directly nation-building, and it is mainly with those who
have those imports to dispose of that we shall be able to do business. In otherwords, we shall inevitably be thrown even more upon the Empire market thanever before in order to be able to survive at all. In those conditions the loss ofEmpire preferences to us might well make all the difference between healthysurvival and a disastrous lowering of the whole standard of life of our people.11. Moreover, we are directly responsible for the standard of life, not onlyof our own people in the United Kingdom, but for the peoples of our ColonialEmpire, a responsibility which public opinion is increasingly recognising. Theabolition of Imperial Preference would mean complete economic collapse for theWest Indies, Mauritius, and other sugar-producing colonies, for East Africancoffee and sisal and for other promising colonial industries., Nor can we rejectat any rate some moral responsibility towards interests which have been built upby preference in the Dominions. Southern. Rhodesia lives largely by virtue ofthe tobacco industry. The butter, sugar, fruit and wine industries of Australiaand.South Africa, the dairy and meat industries of New Zealand, the bacon,fruit and lumber industries of Canada, would all be seriously injured, if notdestroyed, by the abolition of Preference. Is this the return we are to make tothem for assistance given unquestioningly from the very outset of the war andby far greater relative efforts and sacrifices than the United States have yetbegun to make?12. It may be said that some of the present Dominion Governments, lookingto the disposal of their surpluses of wheat or wool, are so attracted by the speciousprospect of lower American tariffs and of a free trade post-war world, as to benot indisposed to our acceptance of the American proposals. I am convinced, forthe reasons given earlier in this paper, that they would make a fatal mistake. Butin any case the issue is one of such gravity for them, as for all of us, that it isunthinkable that it should be settled by the exchange of a few telegrams andwithout the very fullest inquiry and in the light of the conditions which willface all of us afer the war.13. That brings me to an issue far transcending in importance the economicconsiderations which I have so far discussed. We have evolved, as an Empire,over the last half century, not in the direction of federation with a rigid divisionof functions between the central and local Governments, but towards a&quot; Commonwealth &quot; based on informal free co-operation. If that Commonwealthis to prosper, or even survive, that co-operation cannot be confined to foreignpolicy and defence but must include that economic field which is more and morebecoming the major part not only of social, but also of foreign and defence policy.In the development of that Commonwealth system lies, in the minds of many,not only the best hope of our own future, but the best and most practical examplewhich Europe and other parts of the world might yet follow for the composingof their own differences and for surmounting the economic and political anarchywhich have bred this war.14. So far at any rate as this country is concerned and the same was trueof the Dominions Imperial Preference was urged for a generation by itsadvocates, not so much for economic profit as for the ideal of unity in freedom,the ideal for which we are fighting to-day. When the policy of Free Trade wasabandoned in this country and we became free at Ottawa to initiate a system ofImperial preference, no one doubted but that the policy, so long contested, hadcome to stay, and would be continuously further developed. Its abandonment now,without opportunity for full consideration here, without another ImperialConference to endorse it, would come as a terrible shock, not. only to Conservatives,but to millions of former Free Traders who had looked upon the issue as settled.It would be widely regarded as a betrayal of the Empire in return for theEmpire&apos;s co-operation in the war. It would raise an issue in politics whichwould not be settled until the policy was once more reversed, and which might,meanwhile, seriously impair our unity during the war. It would raise similarcontroversy in every Dominion. The feeling against Mr. Mackenzie King inCanada for being pro-American and weak-kneed on Empire issues might easilyblaze up into disastrous passion. 015. What is more, the controversy everywhere would be bound to take ananti-American turn, if not openly during the war, yet immediately afterwards.
irIThere is already a great deal of anti-American feeling in the business world overthe export restrictions imposed on us as a part price of the Lease-Lend policy,I cannot imagine a finer present to Sir Oswald Mosley than the opportunity ofposing, after the war, as a champion of Britain and the Empire betrayed by the jOld Gang to become the Lebensraum of American Pluto-democracy! Whateverelse the acceptance of the present American demand may or may not involve inthe economic sphere, it is certainly calculated to have a disastrous effect uponAnglo-American relations. It is, not least, in the interest of those relationsthat I would urge the Government to stand firm on this issue and make it quiteclear to the President and his associates that, on political even more thaneconomic grounds, we cannot possibly accept any agreement which pledges us toforgo the right of the members of the British Commonwealth to settle theirinternal economic relations among themselves.L. S. A.January 12, 1942.
