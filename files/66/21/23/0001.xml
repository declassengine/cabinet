THirDOCIJMBKT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY8SGOYEBMMENT:Printed for the War Cabinet.  January 1942.$EGRET.    . : Copy N^.w.pV(*2) 43.January 28, 1942.WAR CABINET.THE INDIAN POLITICAL SITUATION.IN connection with my memorandum on the above subject (W.P. (42) 42)I circulate the following: telegram from the Viceroy. .L. S.A.India Office, Jamiary 28, 1942.:   Telegram from the Viceroy to the Secretary of State for India, datedJanuary 21. 1942.(MostImmediate.)104. S. His Majesty&apos;s Government will wish for an appreciation of politicalposition here in the light of recent developments, particularly Bardoli Resolution,and for my suggestions as to policy which we should wisely adopt in the presentcircumstances. Text of Jinnah&apos;s Resolution at Nagpur and of Bardoli Resolutionand gist of discussions on the latter in All-India Congress Committee will&quot; beavailable to you and need not be repeated here. &apos; ;.2. Cabinet will have noted in Bardoli Resolution insistent demand for fullfreedom &apos;&apos;; reference to our system as &quot; arrogant Imperialism which is iridisrtinguishabie from Fascist authoritarianism &quot;; and deliberate misrepresentationof our attitude. Discussion of Resolution in All-India Congress Committee on13th January was important as bringing out the real reluctance of substantialelements to co-operate wholeheartedly whatever happens; fact that the Resolutionwas gotJ;hrough after all on the assumption that it committed nobody to anythingunless His Majesty&apos;s Government conceded Congress demand, when the positioncould be reconsidered; and extent to which elements in Congress were afraid toantagonise possible victors by helping or coming to terms with us. Rajagopala-chari added that Bardoli Resolution &quot; does not say what we want. The BritishGovernment know what we want. Therefore we need not reiterate it,&quot; and asusual with Congress pronouncements, there has been a number of competingpublic statements by prominent Congressmen as to what exactly it means.3. In effect Bardoli Resolution taken with discussion in A.I.C.C. representsreiteration of Congress demand for surrender by His Majesty&apos;s Government tocongress claims, ignoring other parties and interests and their own obligationsin the hope that they will get Congress support in fighting the war. Its mainimportance is that it places us at some tactical disadvantage because of the easewith which it can be misrepresented to our disadvantage here and elsewhere,while it has helped Congress machine by responding to strong feeling in theI country that non-violence is an impossible proposition in present conditions withJapanese next door. It is important not to let ourselves be hypnotised byRajagopalachari and his appearance of reasonableness and plausibility. He isendeavouring to concentrate spotlight on himself and to obscure the verysignificant dissident strains that have emerged in discussions at A.I.C.C.; whileCongress publicity will continue to over-simplify the resolution and endeavour topresent it to the public quietly as offer to co-operate on reasonable terms.4.   The Moslem League attitude, so far as I am aware, remains unchanged,with Jinnah apprehensive that His Majesty&apos;s Government will allow themselvesto be stampeded by Hindus and Congress.   Jinnah has just informed Lumley[23382-2]
that he stands firm on Pakistan, and thinks that Hindus are out to get us tomake an engagement which would prejudge and rule out Pakistan, and, havingobtained that, use it as weapon with which to intimidate Moslems. In allminority provinces the Moslems had sampled Congress rule, and were determinednot to submit to any constitution which would install Congress domination overwhole of country. He does not think that Congress resolutions have materiallyaltered their position, and thinks that Secretary of State, in reply to a recentquestion in Parliament, has made only possible answer. He accepts withoutquestion that we genuinely want to arrive at a settlement which must meanatransfer of power, but is afraid that we may succumb to pressure, though heseemed, to Lumley, well satisfied with present attitude of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.5. Minorities, such as scheduled castes, and large body of opinion whichis anxious to assist but knows that it can in no circumstances hope to exercisereal control itself over political future, is watching line we shall take withuneasiness and uncertainty.6. Issue is clearly of great importance, and we must consider it dispassion-ately. I am quite ready to accept that it may be necessary for us to alter genera]line of our policy towards&apos; India after and as a consequence of the war. But Iam clear in any event that policy as it stands (ultimate dominion status andtransfer of real power to Indians at centre, &amp;c, and ultimate implementing ofarrangements covered by Declaration of August 1940) is one which can only besuccesfully implemented from a strong position. Our present position I wouldnot regard as a strong one, and our prestige is undergoing some deterioration.I have to bear in mind further fact that we are under warning that we may loseSingapore, and that, as I have frequently informed Secretary of State, I amadvised that India is at present wholly insufficiently protected against attack, andthat direct attack on any considerable scale might produce an exceedingly difficultsituation to hold in terms of security in this country. I would not judge thatthere could wisely be any question allowing ourselves to be stampeded intoimplementing either wholly or partially our long-term policy in such circum-stances and at present time. And if I am right in thinking that these are notcircumstances in which implementation of our long-term policy is practicable,I am of opinion equally that there is very little if anything further that we cando within our tether.7. I develop this position further below. In doing so I concentrate on issueas affecting Centre. The Provincial aspects, though important, are less so andnot decisive in present argument.8.   Main propositions put forward for our consideration are either (a) In effect, implementation of our long-term policy either completely or toa degree which would make it impossible for us after the war toregain any ground given now, and which we thought it desirable toretrace, e.g., the Congress demand for acceptance of completeindependence for India, to be accompanied by positive immediatesteps in evidence, and their demand (Bardoli Resolution) for a &quot; Freeindependent India which only can be in a position to undertake thedefence of the country on a national basis and be of help to thefurtherance of larger causes that are emerging from the storm ofwar &quot;; or(b) The Sapru type of proposal elimination of Parliamentary control,Viceroy to have autocratic powers with wholly non-official executiveresponsible to him, &amp;c.9. To take second category first. Cabinet will be fully alive to the objectionsto the severance of Parliamentary control, and will appreciate that the acceptanceof Sapru&apos;s propositions would compromise the post-war position beyond anyquestion, while I do not myself believe that it would secure us the support ofthe major political parties. They represent a leap in the dark from the solidplatform of the Act of 1935 and with no guarantee of any reward. &apos;&apos; HomeRule for the Viceroy,&quot; which I have been disturbed to see that The Times hastended to support, ignores the impossibility of any Governor-General reconcilinghis diverse obligations, or disposing on an autocratic basis of all the resourcesof this immense country, without Parliamentary sanction and control.  We have
already made arrangements to meet the contingency, of a breakdown ,of allcommunications between London and Delhi. Indeed in any emergency it mav;well be unavoidable that the Governor-General should take immediate responsi-bility for much about which he would prefer to have secured the prior consentof His Majesty&apos;s Government. But all this is very different from a proposal torelease the Governor-General and the Government of India from all statutorycontrol by His Majesty&apos;s Government and Parliament. Nor do I believe that anyentirely non-official Council that I could put together, unless it had the fullsupport of majority parties (who have refrained from supporting Sapru), wouldbe better than I have got at the moment. Sapru and his friends carry no realweight here. The inclusion of all or any of them would add nothing to effectivenessof our prosecution of war; and I think it quite likely that we should be understrong pressure from them for concessions in this direction or that designed toshow Indian public opinion that they really counted for something. In a whollyIndianised Council I should be much concerned, too, lest the moment the wardrew nearer to India we found ourselves under pressure to recall Indian forma-&apos;tions overseas for India &apos;s local defence, and to close down despatch of warlikesupplies outside India in interests of conserving them for India herself. I wouldtake that risk very seriously if I had strong Congress element in CentralGovernment, but it cannot be ignored even with a Central Government ofmoderates of Sapru type.11. So much for what I might call a policy of nibbling, and of endeavouringto buy off opposition by concessions of greater or lesser importance, which wouldnot, however, take us all the way to. our final objective. I how turn to widersuggestion that we should, in effect, go the whole way at once, accept demand forfull independence and give tangible proof of reality of our doing so. It seemsto me to be out of the question to consider anything of the sort. And I imaginethat that will be feeling of Cabinet also. On that assumption we may take it thatthere is no possibility of giving satisfaction to Congress or securing their realand whole-hearted support. In my experience they are entirely ruthlesspoliticians; will take all they can get; will do their utmost to manoeuvre us intoa position in which we make sacrifices that are substantial and that will increasethe prestige and power of Congress in this country. But short of acceptance oftheir full demand no sacrifices however great can be relied on to keep them quiet,12. I need not develop the unfortunate effect on those who genuinelysympathise with us in this country, or on those to whom we have given under-takihgs, such as Moslem League, or on the Princes, of allowing ourselves to bestampeded into negotiations with Congress or acceptance of Congress demand.Nor (while possibility of underground negotiations can never be wholly ruled out)do I see anything to suggest that Congress and Moslem League are at this stagelikely to unite and get together in an expanded Council. Jinnah had made clearto the Editor of the Times of India that he would regard as essential, firstly,50 : &quot;SO in any such Council; secondly, that representation of minorities shouldbe secured through him and be under his control, since otherwise minority repre-sentatives would be absorbed by Hindu element. (I need not elaborate difficultieswhich any such arrangement would produce.)13.   My general conclusion, viewing this difficult matter with greatestdetachment that I can, and with full sense of its importance, is in these circum-stances that we should stand firm and make no further move.   I do not believethat any further move at this stage will be likely to improve India &apos;s contributionto the war.  As mentioned above, I think it quite possible that further transferof power might mean pressure on us for withdrawal of Indian troops and Indian, supply.   I do not believe that we could rely on a united India (even a united^ British India, for Princes tend to be ignored to a dangerous degree in discussionsin press, &amp;c.) solid behind us in fighting the war.   India is hopelessly, and I. suspect irremediably, split by racial and religious divisions which we cannotbridge, and which become more acute as any real transfer of power by us drawsnearer. / -14. I take very seriously, too, in reaching my conclusions possibility thatfurther transfer would give marked encouragement to Quisling activity. Recentreport from military authorities in Eastern India is to the effect that there is alarge and dangerous potential fifth column in Bengal, Assam and Bihar and
Orissa, and that, indeed, potentiality of pro-enemy-: sympathy and activity inEastern India is enormous. Sarat Bose has been a lesson. The activities ofU Saw and Tin Tut (senior Civil Servant occupying a very responsible position)are another and a grave one. I know that we are frequently urged to do somethingto &quot;touch the heart of India &quot; and our sympathies naturally lean in that direction.But Cabinet will, I think, agree with me that India and Burma have no naturalassociation with Empire, from which they are alien by race, history and religion,and for which neither of them has any natural affection, and both are inEmpire because they are conquered countries which had been brought there byforce, kept there by our control, and which hitherto it has suited to remainunder our protection&apos;. I suspect that the moment they think that we may lose thewar or take a bad knock, their leaders would be much more concerned to maketerms with victor at our expense than to fight for ideals to which so muchlip-service is given, and I have been impressed by prominence given byRajagopalachari to doubts felt in A.I.O.C. as to wisdom of antagonising possiblevictors. &apos;.    ,; &apos; &apos; *15. What we have to decide, however, is Avhether in such circumstances,whatever feeling of India, we intend to stay in this country for our own reasons,and whether India&apos;s place in Imperial communications is not so important, at anyrate in war time, that we must hold on and must not relinquish power beyond acertain point. If we accept that India is too important at this stage for us totake any chances, then I would rather face such trouble as we may have to facehere as a result of making no concessions now in political field than make con-cessions which are ill-advised and dangerous, and on which we might have to goback for reasons of Imperial security at a later stage in the war.16. I recognise to the full that Cabinet have to deal with much left wingpressure and pressure from academic theorists or sentimentalists, reflected evenin papers so important as The Times. This battle, if it is lost, will, however, belost at home and not in India, and if my suggestion that we make no move isaccepted by yourself and by Cabinet it will be necessary to consider the best lineto take to try to damp down activities of this order. You alone can judge howmuch significance is to be attached to criticism in the press and from left wingand liberal element in Parliament. I would have judged it myself to be largelya reflection of uneasiness at the turn things have taken in the Far East, and to bebased on the assumption, which I do not regard as correct, that by a generousgesture now we can unite India behind us and get her solid moral support forthe prosecution of the War;-      - ; - -  17. His Majesty&apos;s Government will naturally wish to appear as constructiveas possible in any debate. I suggest, however, that the general line of any debatecould properly be that we have responsibilities to discharge and pledges tohonour, to harp again on the depth and reality of the Indian differences; to insistthat in no circumstances shall we go back on our pledges to Moslems; to bring outincompatibility of Moslem League demands with those of Congress; to show thepublic how little the Bardoli Resolution really means; to lay particularemphasis on discussion in All-India Congress Committee; to repeat (it does notmatter if it bores people here) the merits of August offer and reluctance ofCongress to face up to it; to repeat that it was Indians themselves alone thatmade impossible in October 1940 something approximating pretty closely to whatCongress are now asking for; to stress that we have got in practice as national aGovernment and as good a national Government as we can get in present circum-stances, in expanded Council; and, as a possible constructive alternative, to referto the possibility of the federal scheme (which to my point of view secures defence,secures a degree (corrupt group) control, brings in conservative (corrupt group) ly ^element to which our undertakings are so important, and would be practicableconsistently with maintenance of war effort). On these lines I should hope thatwe could gain any ground which Congress have taken from us by appearance ofreadiness to co-operate on reasonable terms which attaches to Bardoli Resolution.18. Above represents my own considered view. I have not yet consultedGovernors, though I would expect general support from them for policy ofstanding firm. If there is any further information which you or Cabinet requireto enable you to reach decision you will, I am sure, let me know.
