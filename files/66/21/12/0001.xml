(42) 32.January 21, 1942.WAR CABINET.LEASE-LEND AGREEMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.,.. EVER since the passage of the Lend-Lease Act the Dominions have beenkept continuously informed of all developments affecting the supply of theirrequirements under the Act from the United States, and in particular they havebeen kept currently informed of all stages in our negotiations with the UnitedStates on the &quot;Consideration&quot; Agreement. &quot;We have not so far asked theDominion Governments for a formal expression of their views. For it has seemedbest not to do so while these difficult di scussions have been proceeding. It hasalways been recognised that such final consultation will be necessary beforethe Agreeement can be signed by the United Kingdom Government, but experiencein consultations with the Dominions on important issues has always shown that,if a prolonged and possibly confusing exchange of views is to be avoided, ourfinal request for the opinion of Dominion Governments is best accompanied bya reasoned statement and explanation of the conclusions reached by the UnitedKingdom Government itself upon the points at issue.2. It is not the purpose of this memorandum to attempt an estimate of theeconomic advantages derived by the United Kingdom and the Dominions fromImperial Preference. If the choice before us now were between the maintenance:,of Imperial Preference and its wholesale and immediate abandonment, such ahestimate would be very relevant and necessary, and I have little doubt that itwould make a convincing case for dismissing the second alternative. But thisis not the position as I see it. Our problem is whether or not to commit ourselvesto the pursuit, by joint and agreed action with the United States and othercountries who may adhere, of certain complementary economic objectives. The&quot;elimination of all forms of discriminatory treatment in international commerce&quot;is one of these objectives; the &quot;reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers &quot;is another. There can be no question of our being committed to precipitateunilateral action in regard to Imperial Preference. The &quot; governing economicconditions &quot; of both parties must be taken into account in seeking the means ofattaining these objectives. Thus no wholesale and immediate abandonment ofImperial Preference is envisaged; As I see it, if our interpretation of Article 7of the Lease and Lend Agreement is accepted, we shall be committed to modifica-tions tending towards the ultimate elimination of Imperial Preference only inreturn for compensatory advantages; to be produced by the parallel action ofthe other parties, which will make it Worth pur while, and only if such advantagesare actually forthcoming.3. Nevertheless,; even so the political implications of such a commitmentcannot be ignored. Political importance has always been attached to ImperialPreference as a significant element in the special relationships existing betweenthe self-governing parts of the Empire. The political autonomy of the Dominions,conditiptied by their common allegiance to the Crown, has not altered the fact thatthe political relations between self Tg&apos;overning parts of the Empire are definitelydifferent in character from the relations between any part of the Empire and a[23367]
foreign country, or from relations between foreign countries. The fiscal autonomyof the Dominions, which was established and freely exercised long before theirpolitical autonomy, has not prevented the self-governing countries of the Empirefrom maintaining with each other special economic relationships different incharacter from those existing between any self-governing part of the Empireand a foreign country, or between foreign-cojuntries. There are some who wouldregard the very acceptance of a commitment contemplating the ultimateelimination of the special economic tie of Imperial Preference as having aprofound effect upon the maintenance of the special political tie. It must berecognised that this view is held in many quarters not only in this country but inthe Dominions, where the Imperial connexion, and Imperial Preference as onefeature in that connexion, have time and again appeared as a dominant politicaland electioneering issue. 1&apos; -&apos; -4. The issue is apt to arise in different forms and to produce differentreactions according to the special circumstances affecting each Dominion. InCanada there has been the historic fight over &apos;&apos; reciprocity &apos;&apos; with the UnitedStates, and, in general, it may be said that the best friends in Canada of theImperial political ties regard Imperial Preference as an important factor inresisting an increased economic dependence on the United States, which mightbring with it a movement towards a political merger. In South Africa there aremany opponents of the political tie with the United Kingdom who attack theeconomic , dependence fostered by Imperial Preference as an obstacle to therealisation of the political independence at which they aim. In Australia therehave been violent attacks on constitutional grounds against those features of theOttawa Agreement, so important to the United Kingdom, which bind the Legisla-ture to modify the tariff in accordance with the findings of the Australian TariffBoard. Imperial Preference, with all its merits, is in fact a double-edgedweapon.  It can create both friends and foes in the Dominions. &apos;5, The political implications of accepting the commitment junder discussionwill have to be weighed by each of the Dominion Governments in accordance withtheir own estimates of Parliamentary and public opinion iii their respectivecountries. I cannot predict what attitude they will adopt when we finally invitetheir views, with an indication of our own, but there are available certainindications as to the probabilities.(a) South Africa.The most definite indications are the comments volunteered by General Smutson the receipt of our informatory telegrams. In a message on the 4th Octoberhe agreed with our view that the United States original draft of Article VIIwent too far in tying the Empire Governments&apos; hands in respect of exchangeand import restrictions and similar measures which might still prove necessaryafter the war.   He went on to say : &quot; Regarding Imperial Preference which is certain to be raised eitherunder the proposed amendment to Article VII or in the future discussionsmentioned in that amendment, a word of caution may be uttered.&quot; The system has been valuable in the past, but has naturally beenresented in the United States of America and elsewhere. At the ParisPeace Conference President Wilson gave serious warnings about its futureeffects.  The Ottawa Conference has added to the trouble..&quot; A more or less closed economic system invites counter-measures whichultimately affect the world&apos;s peace policy. The Germans are already movingtowards a continental economic bloc which may ultimately have seriousrepercussions for other countries. Considerations both of world peace andworld economy therefore lead us to ask whether we should not move towardscloser Anglo-American economic co-operation, and ultimately towards a. broader economic system which may include also other democratic countriesnow our allies. It might therefore not be wise from the broader point of: view to stand pat on the present preference system. If the United Statesof America really wish to move away from political and economicisolationism and to link up more closely with the British Commonwealth weshould welcome the gesture. A careful reconsideration of the whole intricatequestion of Imperial Preference under the new world conditions and fromthe broadest point of view seems therefore to be called for.&quot;
In a message on the 8th January, he expressed the view that &apos;&apos; we would dothe cause of Anglo-American co-operation a grave disservice if we.raisedImperial Preference as a direct issue in the present connexion and discussions.&quot;This view was partly based on the misapprehension that we could &quot; by-pass thissnag in silence in these discussions.&quot; I have explained to General Smuts thatthis is not possible; that it has been expressly stated to Lord Halifax that boththe State Department and the President himself intend the words &apos;&apos; all forms ofdiscriminatory treatment in international commerce&apos;&apos; to include ImperialPreference; that the issue has thus been forced on us whether we like it or not;and that, by keeping silence and accepting the draft as it stands, we should infact be committing ourselves without qualification to the proposition that theabolition of Imperial Preference is one of the objectives to which we must work.General Smuts concluded his message by saying : &quot; After all, we have found theAmericans quite reasonable in the present negotiations for a Trade Agreementbetween the United States and the Union, which embodies preferences, and welook forward to Anglo-American relations creating an even better spirit ofmutual accommodation as our co-operation continues. A dispute now overImperial Preference might have a very bad effect on a much wider area thanImperial Preference.&quot;(b) Australia. . 1Here the indications are much less definite. On being informed of theUnited Kingdom counter-draft of Article VII&apos; which held the field in Octoberlast, the Commonwealth Government telegraphed that they had no objection toour re-draft, but that they considered it essential, particularly in view of theconversations contemplated in the re-draft, that there should be early consulta-tion between the United Kingdom and Dominion Governments on all the issuesinvolved. The Commonwealth Government can be under no misapprehension asto the implications of Article VII in regard to Imperial Preference. In atelegram sent to his Government on the 11th October, 1941 (of which we haveseen a copy), the Australian Minister reported that in an interview on that date,President Roosevelt, speaking of the situation of &apos;&apos; non-discrimination &apos;&apos; in tradebetween the United States and Empire countries at which he was aiming, toldMr. Casey that &quot;he realised this meant the end of the Ottawa agreements, buthe believed that the target he was aiming at meant a great deal more for theworld and for British countries than limited pre-war bilateralism on the Ottawamodel.&quot;(c) New Zealand.The New Zealand Government have not expressed any views. The PrimeMinister of New Zealand had an interview with President Roosevelt inSeptember 1941, after which he gave some account of what had passed to theCommercial Counsellor at Washington. Mr. Fraser told Sir Owen Chalkley thathe was much impressed by the Presidents understanding of and sympathy withthe war and post-war economic problems of New Zealand. Mr. Fraser had toldthe President that Imperial Preference had been essential for New Zealandowing to her dependence on the United Kingdom market and to being shut outof the United States market. Imperial Preference was beneficial to the BritishCommonwealth in expanding trade and raising the standard of living, but thatwas not to say that it could not be replaced by something better. That dependedon the United States. The President had agreed. Mr. Fraser said also that hehad been impressed by the very high degree of importance which the Presidentand Mr. Hull attach to the future trade relations between the United States andthe British Commonwealth. Mr. Fraser felt that this was not sufficiently realisedin London.(d) Canada..Canada is not a recipient of Lend-Lease aid, but as a partner in ImperialPreference would be as much affected as the other Dominions by any undertakingwe gave. The Canadian Government have received all the information sent toother Dominion Governments but have volunteered no comment. Feeling somewhatconcerned at not being able to give my colleagues any indication of the probableattitude of the Canadian Government, I thought it desirable to ask Mr. Malcolm
MaeDonald for his personal appreciation of their probable reaction. Mr. Mac-Donald tells me that he has ascertained that the subject, has not yet beendiscussed at all by Canadian Ministers. He has, however, (had some informaltalk on the subject with Mr. Norman Robertson, Permanent Head of theDepartment of External Affairs, who will be principally responsible for advisingthe Canadian Government on this subject, and who has indeed already putforward some tentative advice to his Prime Minister. Mr! Robertson&apos;s views aresummarised by Mr. MacDonald as follows : &quot; He thinks the latest draft of Article VII from the United States ispretty good and would see no objection to it from the Canadian point ofview. He ventures to agree with Lord Halifax that it would be a greatmistake to postpone discussions with the United States Government now..... He would advise Canadian Ministers to support the early conclusionof an Agreement on the lines of the latest draft.&quot;6. The subject of Article VII was raised informally at one of my dailymeetings with the Dominion High Commissioners and I might mention, for whatit is worth, that Mr. Massey, Mr. Bruce and Mr. Waterson all seemed to thinkthat their Governments would not feel much difficulty in agreeing to the latestUnited States re-draft. Mr. Jordan was not present. The discussion wassomewhat casual, as the High Commissioners had not studied the matter carefullyor (except for Mr. Waterson) received any guidance from their Governments.7. To sum up, on the basis of these indications I should conclude thatthe Governments of Canada, the Commonwealth, New Zealand and the Unionare likely to be in favour of accepting the terms of Article VII as put forwardin the latest United States re-draft. The specific evidence quoted above suggeststhat the Dominions are in general apprehensive lest a lack of response shouldjeopardise the prospects of future co-operation with the United States. Thegeneral war situation, and the increased dependence of Australia and NewZealand in particular upon immediate co-operation in the Pacific, are likely tostrengthen Australia certainly and possibly also New Zealand in this attitude.8. I have no means of knowing what degree of importance the DominionGovernments would attach to an agreed interpretative document such as is nowcontemplated in the event of our taking the view that Article VII should beaccepted. But it is evident that the bearing of Article VII upon the futureof Imperial Preference is, on the publication of the Agreement, likely to becomethe subject of discussion not only in Congress and in Parliament here, but alsoin the Parliaments of the four Dominions. If divergent interpretations wereis clear that grave embarrassment would be caused to all of us. For this reason,Tio&quot;l5e&quot;p1acedTipon the implications of the Article in so many different places, itwhile I should be prepared to put the latest re-draft of Article VII to theDominions, on the assumption that it means what we think it does, I think itessential to avoid ambiguity by means of an agreed interpretation with the UnitedStates, for use by all concerned when the Agreement is published.Dominions Office, January 21, 1942.
