THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  January1942.WAR CABINET.POLICY TOWARDS RUSSIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.SINCE my conversations in Moscow with M. Stalin I have been examining I. The foundations on which co-operation between Great Britain and theUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics can be built during the post-warperiod.II. The best manner in which to deal with Stalin&apos;s demand for the recogni-tion of the Soviet Union&apos;s 1941 frontiers.1. On the assumption that Germany is defeated and German military-strength is destroyed and that France remains, for a long time at least, a weakPower, there will be no counterweight to Russia in Europe. But it may yet benecessary to maintain co-operation with Russia (a) because she might otherwisebe tempted to collaborate with Germany in view of the historical tendency to, andeconomic urge for, these two Powers to work together; (b) in order to recreate inour own interest the balance of power in Europe against the possibility of arevived Germany, which balance has been destroyed by the collapse of France;(c) in order that, militarily speaking, Germany should be encircled. It is truethat France, whose greatness we have promised to restore, may eventually becomea Power again in Europe, thanks to her material resources and to the destructionof German military strength. Thus the balance of power in Europe mayeventually be partially restored through the revival of France. But all this ishighly problematical and will certainly not take place in the immediate post-warperiod, which we have to provide for now.2. Any estimate of the probable course of Soviet policy must depend uponthe course of the war and its effect upon the U.S.S.R., the condition in which theSoviet Union emerges from the war and the circumstances in which the war isterminated. If the defeat of the German armies is brought about chiefly by theaction of the Soviet forces before the war potential of Great Britain and Americais fully developed, Russia&apos;s position on the European continent will beunassailable. Russian prestige will be so great that the establishment ofCommunist Governments in the majority of European countries will be greatlyfacilitated, and the Soviet Government will naturally be tempted to work forthis. The Russians may, moreover, be in a position to denude the Germanfactories of the equipment needed to restore Russian industry without regard toour or American views or needs. The Soviet Union by these means may becomelargely independent of the assistance which they would otherwise be compelledto pall upon from this country and America, and, being independent of thisassistance, they would no longer require to adapt themselves to the policies whichGreat Britain and the United States may desire to pursue. But this possible11617   f23393] BSECRET TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. Gopy NoIt Is requested that special care may be taken toW.P. (42) 48. ensure the secreoy of this document.January 28, 1942.
development is in itself a reason for establishing close relations with the SovietUnion now while their policy is still in a fluid state, in order to exercise as muchinfluence as possible on the moulding of their future course of action.3. If, on the other hand, Russia is thoroughly exhausted by the war, then,needing Anglo-United States assistance in the work of restoration, Stalin will becompelled to follow, temporarily at any rate, a policy adapted to this less favour-able position of the Soviet Union. If we could be certain that events would sofall out, it could be argued that we would not need to make any concessions andsacrifices at this stage and could afford to maintain that Stalin must inevitablyalign his policy with that of Great Britain and the United States of America,since he would be so dependent upon these two countries at the end of the war.But we clearly cannot gamble on events working out in this way, and commonprudence requires that we should lay our plans on the assumption that if wewant Russia&apos;s collaboration after the war we shall have to be prepared to makesuch a policy advantageous to her. Moreover, the application of this policy isgoing to be a laborious and lengthy process. If we are to adopt it, we musttherefore start on it now and not wait until the war is over.4. There is bound to be difficulty in practice in harmonising day-to-dayAnglo-Russian co-operation with Anglo-American co-operation. Soviet policy isamoral; United States policy is exaggeratedly moral, at least where non-Americaninterests are concerned. In America there is still a widely-spread feeling ofdistrust and dislike of Russia, which the Pact with Hitler and Russia&apos;s attackon Finland greatly augmented. As United States opinion, however, becomesmore realistically minded under the stress of war, this feeling may be graduallymodified, especially as Russian assistance would be valuable to the United Statesof America in preventing a revival of Japanese militarism in the Far East. Thequestion of the Baltic States is the first example of this conflict of principlebetween the United States and the Soviet Government. The Soviet Governmenthave endorsed the Atlantic Charter, but at once seek leave to by-pass one of itsprinciples, while the United States Government, for the present at least, regardthem as sacred. If it came to a direct conflict of policies and we had to choosebetween the United States of America and the Soviet Union, we should no doubtdecide that Anglo-American co-operation is more indispensable and the morenatural because it rests on broader and older foundations than Anglo-Russianco-operation.5. On the other hand, we shall wish to abstain from any action which wouldintensify the Soviet Governments already existing suspicion that we look forwardto an Anglo-American peace in which Russian interests would be thwarted orignored.6, In practice this means that, in order successfully to reconcile Americanand Russian susceptibilities and to co-ordinate our policy with both of theirs, weshall have to consult the United States Government in all our discussions withthe Soviet Government, and try to obtain their approval or at least theiracquiescence in all Anglo-Soviet arrangements. Wherever possible we shouldwork for tripartite consultations and tripartite solutions.II.7. In considering question (ii), namely, the best manner in which to dealwith M. Stalin&apos;s demand for the recognition of the Soviet Union&apos;s 1941 frontiers,the following considerations suggest themselves from the point of view of ourown interests : ,/ (a) Superficially this demand is very reasonable when we recall how muchM. Stalin might have asked for in relation to such matters as thecontrol of the Dardanelles; spheres of influence in the Balkans; aone-sided imposition on Poland of the Russo-Polish frontier; accessto the Persian Gulf; access to the Atlantic involving cession ofNorwegian and Finnish territory. It may, of course, be argued thatwe have no right to suppose that M. Stalin&apos;s present demand is final,and that it will be followed in due course by others. But, even so, thefact that we had granted this demand would not prevent us fromresisting further demands which he might subsequently make.Indeed, it would strengthen our position for doing so.
(b) Looked at purely from the strategic point of view it may well be in theBritish interest that Russia should be established once again on theBaltic, so as to be able better to dispute with Germany the navalcommand of that sea than she was able to do during the period-since1918, when her access to. the Baltic was limited to Kronstadt.    -(c) It would not do to make this or, indeed, any concession to M. Stalinwithout requiring a suitable quid pro quo. He would, in his oriental:mind, interpret such an omission as a sign of weakness. Besides, byinsisting on our concessions being part of a bargain, we establish the,rule that concessions must be mutual, and this will make it moredifficult for the Soviet Government to press us subsequently to agreeto yet further concessions, i.e., to push us on to the &quot; slippery slope.&apos;A list of possible counter-concessions which we might ask for is giveh.in the Annex to this Paper. .    &apos;(d) There is no gainsaying the fact that M. Stalin&apos;s demand for the BalticStates and, to a lesser degree, his demand for Finnish and Bessarabiahterritory can hardly be reconciled with the principles laid down inthe Atlantic Charter, where it is stated that the Allies seek noaggrandisement, territorial or other; that they desire to see noterritorial changes that do not accord with the freely-expressed wishesof the peoples themselves; and that they wish to see sovereign rights-;and self-government restored to those who have been forcibly deprivedof them. By implication it also clashes with the provision of theCharter thatthe Allies will respect the right of all peoples to choosethe form of government under which they will live. M. Stalin, on theother hand, would argue (i) that he is only claiming to recover whatwas Russian territory at the time of the German invasion, whichterritory is how under enemy occupation; (ii) that, in the case of thethree Baltic States, they voted themselves into the Soviet Union inaccordance with the principles since laid down in the AtlanticCharter; and (iii) that Finnish and Roumanian territories were cededto the Soviet Union under duly negotiated treaties with Finland andRoumania.ie) Once we accept the view set forth in Part I of this paper as to the needfor doing all we can now to establish a close co-operation with theSoviet Government in the post-war period, I think it will be agreedthat the arguments in favour of acceding to M. Stalin&apos;s demandwould be overwhelming if it were not for the serious difficulty createdby the Atlantic Charter and opposition in the United States ofAmerica to anything which would appear to sacrifice the freedomof independent nations. We must face the fact that the UnitedStates Government would probably much dislike our yielding to the. Soviet Government on what they hold to be a fundamental questionof principle.8. It is not altogether easy to decide what real object M. Stalin has in viewin insisting upon this particular demand at this juncture. Our acquiescenceor refusal cannot affect Russia&apos;s post-war frontiers one way or the other : if sheis in occupation of the territory involved at the end of the war, neither we norAmerica will turn her out. Probably, however, M. Stalin&apos;s demand is intendedas an acid test to find out how far His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared tomake unpalatable concessions in order to obtain the post-war co-operation ofthe Soviet Union : in other words, to see what value we attach to that co-opera-tion and what sacrifice of principle we are prepared to make in order to achieveit. If this is really M. Stalin&apos;s object, he is not likely to be prepared to acceptany smaller or alternative concession in its place. Sir S. Cripps, whom I haveconsulted since his return from Russia, holds that this is a case of all or nothing,and that our refusal to satisfy M. Stalin will be the end of any prospect offruitful co-operation with the Soviet Government in our mutual interests, andthat Soviet policy will revert to the pursuit of purelv selfish aims, withincalculable consequences for the post-war period. Meanwhile, I have promisedM. Stalin that I would discuss the matter with the United States Government andthe Dominion Governments, and I do not think we ought to delay anv longertaking up the matter with President Roosevelt.[23393] B 2
9 Even though we can hardly hope thatM. Stalin will accept anythingshort of his full demand, I should -prefer to put before President Roosevelt thewhole problem as we see it in all its ramifications. One aspect of it has a verydirect bearing on the United States of Americans immediate war prospects. Forour answer to M. Stalin&apos;s demand might well, in certain circumstances, affectthe Russian decision to make war on Japan or to refrain from doing so. If, as wemust anticipate, the President objects to our acceding to M. Stalin&apos;s full demand,I would be in favour of inviting him to consider whether the special circum-stances do not warrant our making M. Stalin the offer of one or other alternativeschemes, which ought to satisfy him if his present demand is put forward in theinterests of Russian security and not merely in order to find out how far he canforce us to sacrifice our principles and endanger our relations with the UnitedStates. We should try to induce the President not only to acquiesce in, butactually to sponsor, such alternative offers; for M. Stalin might possibly thinkit worth while to accept from the United States Government and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment what he would reject if it were to be binding upon His Majesty&apos;sGovernment alone.10. Any offers we made would have to be based on the requirements ofthat Russian &quot;security&quot; for which the Soviet Union have been striving eversince the 1917 Revolution, that is to say, the creation of a strategic position whichwould enable the Soviet Government to complete the unfinished social and economicexperiment within Russia without the danger of foreign intervention and war.On this basis we could offer M. Stalin at least two alternative proposals :-(A) Russian Bases in the Baltic States.&apos; We might tell him that while we could not agree here and now, withoutjustification, to the restoratior of the 1941 frontiers, Great Britain could giveassurances now that, on the grounds of Soviet &quot; security,&quot; we should supportwhen the time comes a demand by the Soviet Government to establish Soviet basesin the territories contiguous to Russia, and especially on the Baltic and BlackSeas, from which her security might be threatened. The acceptance by theSoviet Government of such an assurance would not preclude them from puttingforward at the Peace Conference their claim to absorb the Baltic States,Bessarabia and parts of Finland. His Majesty&apos;s Government, for their part,would meanwhile remain free from any previous undertaking either to acceptor to reject such a claim if put forward at the peace settlement.The idea of the establishment of military bases by one country in theterritory of another is one which the United States Government itself has putinto operation and which it can be expected to view sympathetically. It is onewhich we, in all probability, intend to develop ourselves after the war, and itis one which the Soviet Government, in the case of the Baltic States in 1939, wasthe first to put into practice.-(B) Control by the Soviet Government of the Foreign Relations and Defencesof the Baltic States.I am indebted to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington for a formulawhich, while ostensibly leaving intact the internal autonomy of the Baltic States,would, in effect, give the Soviet Government all the control that they need overthese States from the point of view of Russian security. The formula runs asfollows : We have every desire and intention to work with you after the peace,and think it is essential for both of us, and for the peace of Europe, that weshould remain in close partnership.&quot; We realise the importance you attach for your own security reasonsto your June 1941 boundaries.&quot; We hold no particular brief for reopening the boundary that youhad established with Finland, because they have allowed themselves to be thetools of Hitler, and we certainly hold no brief for Roumania.&quot; But we are very much concerned, by reason of the Atlantic Charter,which you, M. Stalin, have subscribed to,, and of all that that means for ourgeneral position in the world, with the question of the Baltic States.
&apos;&apos; And, in order to reconcile your security requirements, and our commonobligations under the Atlantic Charter, we would undertake here and nowto support you at the peace settlement if you demand that the foreignpolicy and defence of the Baltic States shall be entrusted to the Soviet Union,who for this purpose shall be entitled to exercise such authority and establishsuch control as may be necessary on the territory of the Baltic States.&quot; .,This formula might serve to reconcile our interest in meeting the wishes ofthe Soviet Government with our obligations under the Atlantic Charter and withAmerican susceptibilities.11. One point that will have to be borne in mind is the question ofLithuania. The Polish Government have expressed the desire that no negotia-tions as regards the future disposal of Lithuanian territory should be enteredinto without consultation with them, and it appears that they are anxious thatthere should be a Polish-Lithuanian union after the war. This scheme, of course,is quite incompatible with the Soviet plan to annex Lithuania, and, indeed, withthe proposal whereby the Soviet Government would control the foreign relationsand defences of the Baltic States. On the other hand, it might possibly bereconciled with the compromise solution whereby the Soviet Government shouldmerely have bases in the Baltic States. It is worth noting that if Stalin insists,as he doubtless intends to, on taking the Curzon Line as the new Polish-Russianfrontier, Poland will have no common frontier with Lithuania unless she annexesEast Prussia (to which Stalin said he would be prepared to agree). From thegeographical point of view, therefore, Poland&apos;s aim in regard to Lithuania couldonly become a matter of practical politics if she obtained from the Soviet Govern-ment either a frontier with Russia considerably to the east of the Curzon Line,or else permission to annex East Prussia.12. To conclude, I would ask that Lord Halifax should be authorised toexplain the whole situation to the United States Government, and, if possible,to President Roosevelt personally, and to consult him as to whether, in viewof the special circumstances, he would be prepared either to acquiesce in ouragreeing to Stalin&apos;s demand as it stands; or, if not, whether he would supportus in putting forward one or other of the two alternatives mentioned in thispaper. This action should be taken as soon as possible, since Stalin has been ledto expect that the views of the United States Government and of the Dominionson this subject will be available within three or four weeks of my return to thiscountry.A. E.Foreign Office, January 28, 1942.ANNEX.THE following are the demands which we &quot;should make of the SovietGovernment in connexion with the proposed agreement: (1) We should secure the recognition by the Soviet Government of the rightof Great Britain, on grounds of security, to the establishment of bases on theEuropean continent, reaffirming what Stalin said to me on the 16th December,namely, &quot; I think if France is not restored or revived as a Great Power in thenear future it would be in your interest to have on the French coast some militaryand naval bases, such as Boulogne and Dunkirk; also Belgium and Holland shouldbe in open military alliance with Great Britain, who should have the right tomaintain in those countries naval and air bases there, and also troops if necessary.I regard such an arrangement as important for Great Britain, and also as aguarantee for the independence of Holland and Belgium. The Soviet Unionwould be prepared to support you in all these plans, which they regard asimportant from the point of view of Great Britain.&quot;
(2) We should require the Soviet Government to subscribe to paragraph 5of the British draft agreement of the 16th December, 1941, namely, that &quot;asregards the territorial questions to be dealt with at the peace settlement, the twoGovernments will base their policy on the principle laid down in the JointDeclaration of the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of theUnited Kingdom that they &apos; seek no aggrandisement, territorial or other,&apos; andon that proclaimed by Stalin in bis statement of the 6th November, 1941, of nointerference in the internal affairs of other people.&quot;(3) We should also ask that the Soviet Government should formally expresstheir approval of the principle of confederation as applied to the weaker countriesof Europe, especially in the Balkans, and as regards Poland and Czechoslovakia.(4) The Soviet Government should be asked to undertake to collaborate withHis Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government and the othercountries of Europe in preparing for the reconstruction of Europe on the linesof Article 4 of the draft agreement offered to Stalin by the Secretary of State,which runs as follows : &quot; The two Contracting Parties undertake to work together for thereconstruction of Europe after the war with full regard to each other&apos;sinterests and in accordance with the two principles of no aggrandisementfor themselves and no interference in the internal affairs of other peoples.The objectives of this task of reconstruction will include in particular (a) The safeguarding and strengthening of the economic andpolitical independence of all European countries either as unitary orfederated States.(b) The reconstruction of the industrial and economic life of thosecountries whose territories have been overrun by Germany or herassociates.&quot;
