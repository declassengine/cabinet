Destroyer Vimiera has been mined and sunk.Heavy gales have prevailed in the North Atlantic. : &apos;Shipping losses have been moderate. .&apos;&apos;,-../.Home Waters.; 2: H.M. Destroyer Vimiera struck a mine off Sheerness on the 9th and sank;Approximately 55 of her crew were rescued and 80 are missing. H.M. Mine-sweeper Rothesay also detonated a mine on the same day to the eastward ofHarwich. Although damaged, she suffered no casualties and was able to returnto harbour under her own steam.Minor damage to naval living quarters and stores was caused by bombing atLowestoft on the 13th.It is estimated that during the week our aircraft have sunk or seriouslydamaged 8,000 tons of enemy merchant shipping. Details are given in the AirSituation. &apos;North Atlantic.3. Exceptionally heavy gales have prevailed in the North Atlantic. H.M.Canadian Destroyer Skeena was severely damaged to the southward of Green-land on the 10th, and two days later H.M.S. Norfolk and H.M. CorvetteDianthus, were damaged off the coast of Iceland (C).H.M. Destroyer Hesperus, escorting a homeward-bound convoy, rammed andsank the German U. 93 to the westward of Gibraltar during the night of the14th/15th. Thirty-seven survivors, including the Captain of the U-boat, werepicked up. H.M.S. Hesperus was considerably damaged and returned toGibraltar.Mediterranean.4. Light naval forces carried out a bombardment of Halfaya Pass onthe 8th.The first convoy to Benghazi began unloading in the port on the 9th; otherWestern Desert convoys are proceeding normally. Derna is in use as a supplyport.H.M. Submarine Thunderbolt, .on the 2nd, shelled and set on fire a 2,000-tonmerchant ship in ballast at the entrance to Argostoli Harbour, off the west coastof Greece. Two days later Thunderbolt sank the Minesweeper Santo Pietro bygunfire north of Cephalonia. H.M. Submarine Upholder, on the 4th, torpedoedthe Italian s.s. Sirio (5,222 tons) east of Palermo, and the following day, usingher last torpedo, she sank an Italian U-boat of the &quot; Saint Bon &quot; class (1,460tons, completed 1941) north-west of Messina. Three survivors were rescued fromthe U-boat. H.M. Submarine Unique, on the 5th, attacked and possibly hit abattleship screened by destroyers approaching Taranto.H;M. Destroyer Kimberley was torpedoed by a U-boat north-east of Tobrukon the 12th and, being unable to steam, was towed to Alexandria.During the week 41,700 tons of French merchant shipping eastbound and25,650 tons westbound have passed through the Straits of Gibraltar under escort.Far East.Philippines.5. An American aircraft bombed and set on fire a Japanese battleship in theGulf pf Davao, Southern Philippines, on the 9th.South, China Sea.,,,, -6. Australian aircraft claim to have hit an enemy cruiser and transportat Manado and Kema, N.E. Celebes. , .

The United States Submarine Pompano reports having sunk a merchantvessel of the Kamakura (17,526 tons) or Yawata (16,500 tons) class in theMarshall Islands.Anti-Submarine Operations.8. In addition to the German and Italian U-boats sunk by H.M. ShipsEespems and Upholder, there have been five attacks by aircraft and six by surfacecraft. Three of the aircraft attacks were made off the Libyan coast, and in oneof these a Sunderland claimed to have destroyed the U-boat. Another promisingattack was carried out by a Liberator north-west of Cape Finisterre.Enemy-. Intelligence.,German Main Units.9. There is no change in the position of the German main units in theBaltic, where Tirpitz and Scheer remain ready for immediate service. At Brestboth Scharnhorst and Gneisenau may have been damaged in recent raids. -      \U-Boats. ...&quot; -10. The westward movement of U-boats across the Atlantic has continued :there are now concentrations south of Newfoundland and off the New Englandcoast. A few U-boats are also operating in the western approaches to the Straitsof Gibraltar.   There is no indication of any activity in the South Atlantic.Japan.11. Photographic air reconnaissance by the R.A.A.F. of Truk Islands, in.the central Carolines, on the 11th showed that, in addition to a floating dock, thefollowing naval units were present: One 8-inch cruiser, one training cruiser(Kashima), two seaplane carriers (Kamoi, Chitrose), one minelayer (Itsukushima),fourteen destroyers, two large merchant ships, 1 hospital ship and, possibly, onemilitary landing craft carrier.Enemy Attaok on Seaborne Trade.12. Of the eight ships known to have been lost during the period, five (threeof them British) were sunk by U-boat. One ship was torpedoed south of Halifax,one east of New York, two ships to the southward of Iceland (C) and one southof Java. Aircraft sank one ship off Whitby, and another was lost by mine offHarwich. A ship on river passenger service,was sunk by aircraft in the MuarRiver, Johore. .. The shipping losses in December (details are given in Appendix I) were40 ships and 4 small craft, totalling 170,233 tons, of which 19 ships andthree small craft (76,235 tons) were British. This total is about 70,000 tonshigher than the previous month, the increase being largely due to losses sustainedin Far Eastern waters and in the Pacific. U-boats sank 21 ships, of which, fivewere in the China Sea and Pacific, six in the Mediterranean, three in the North-Western Approaches and four westward of the coasts of Spain and Portugal.Fourteen ships and two small craft were mined : one off Manila and the remainderin Home Waters, chiefly off the east coast. Four ships and two small craft weresunk by aircraft, two in Home Waters and the remainder in the vicinity of thePhilippines. Five ships and four small craft, totalling 10,134 tons, which areincluded in Appendix I, were reported in December but lost in previous months.In addition, about 117,000 tons of shipping, of which 60,000 tons wereBritish- have been lost in the Far East from seizure, and scuttling to avoidcapture. The totals of losses at the various ports are given at the end ofAppendix I.It is probable that there will be further considerable additions to theDecember losses,; as there are still some 50,000 tons of British and Allied shippingwhich are unaccounted for in Far Eastern waters.[23349] B
Protection of Seaborne Trade. *13.   During the week ending the 15th January 825 ships, including 203Allied and 15 Neutral were convoyed.  Four cruisers, 4 armed merchant cruisersand ocean boarding vessels, 5 anti-aircraft ships, 85 destroyers (including 19United States destroyers) and 101 sloops, corvettes and mine-sweepers were,employed on escort duties.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the week ending10th January totalled 682.000 tons compared with 647,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 858,000 during the past ten weeks. Ofthe wsek&apos;s imports, 318,000 tons were oil of various grades.British Minelaying.14. Mines have been laid by surface craft in the northern part of the EastCoast Barrier. There has also been some minelaying by aircraft in the North Seaand in the Bay of Biscay. ,Enemy Mihelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters. i- - *15. On three nights of the week enemy aircraft are believed to have laidmines in Liverpool Bay, in the outer Thames Estuary and off the entrance to theHumber.; Seventeen magnetic and two acoustic mines have been destroyed during theweek. The mine totals now are : magnetic 1,727, acoustic 1,226, and contact 1,086,Mediterranean.16.   Minelaying by aircraft is suspected on one night at Tobruk.Enemy Merchant Shipping.&apos; &quot; 17. Thirty-two merchant ships belonging to Germany and Italy have triedto run the British blockade and reach Axis-controlled European ports during1941. Seventeen of these were Italian and fifteen German; seventeen sailed fromSouth American ports, ten from the Canaries, four from Japan and one fromItalian East Africa. Fourteen ships totalling some 83,700 tons were intercepted,ten of them being either scuttled or sunk and four captured. Fourteen shipstotalling approximately 79,100 tons succeeded in running the blockade andteaching European ports, and four ships of an approximate total of 20,300 tonshave not been reported since they sailed; though they may be presumed to havereached French ports. In addition to these, four German ships have crossed theAtlantic from east to west, sailing from Axis-controlled ports in Europe to portsin-South America. Only one succeeded in making; the return journey, the otherthree being intercepted.&quot;The Spanish Minister of Marine is reported to have given orders that thecrews of the German tankers in Vigo and Ferrol should be removed, except forone man in each ship, and that an armed guard should fee put onboard. Thereare two tankers in Vigo, the Nord Atlantic (10,711 tons) and the Antarktis(9,^97 tons), and one in Ferrol, the Max AWrecht (5,&apos;S24 tons). The Germanss. Elsa Essberger (6,103 tons) from Japan entered Ferrol on the 12th, after-having been bombed by a Liberator on the previous day.The Germans are continuing to buy small Spanish trawlers and coasters forsferVice ton the African supply routes.&apos; ! Arrangements have been made between the British and Italian Governments,through Swiss intermediaries, for the Italian liner Satw-nia f(24,470 tons) to goto Italian East Africa to embark Italian civilians. She was to sail from Veniceftn the 13th for Trieste and will go via the Cape.Yichy Merchant Shipping.18. The Formigny (2,166 tons), which Was intercepted on 9th Decemberand sent to Gibraltar, has been seized, as her voyage from Lisbon to Oran viaOporto had not been sanctioned. .i ,
At the outbreak of war with Japan there were two Vichy passenger linersin Manila, the diesel ship Marechal Joffre (11,732 tons) and the Si Kiang (7,014tons). The former is reported to have been taken over by the United StatesAuthorities and sailed for a southern port under armed guard.During 1941 425 Vichy merchant ships, totalling just over 1,515,000 tons,passed through the Straits of Gibraltar westwards, and 473 ships, totalling nearly1,676,000 tons, passed eastwards. Over 80 per cent, of these ships were tradingto Morocco and French West Africa.Vichy French intelligence.19. The Vichy French A.M.C. Bougainville, lately the s.s. Victor ScMeicher,was reported on the 12th January to have left Dakar for Diego Suarefc(Madagascar). As an A.M.G. she is reported to carry 5-1-inch guns and anti-aircraft armament in addition. This ship, which has already masqueraded underother names in her passage through the Straits of Gibraltar, p not thes.s. Bougainville which, according to latest information, is still at Saigon.MILITARY SITUATION.Russo-German Campaign.Central Sector.20. A fresh Russian advance west of Kaluga, where a thrust has reachedLyudinovo, on the Vyasma-Bryansk railway, is the only change which has takenplace in this sector. The area of this thrust is believed to have been widened tothe North and South during the past few days. ...      .   . ...Ukraine.21. In the Oboyan area the Russian attacks have been followed by Germancounter-attacks, which have made some progress. A &apos;Eke Russian offensive -stillappears probable in the Kharkov sector, and possibly further South along theDonetz.Crimea. ...   ....... .22. The German operations against Sebastopol, which began nearly a monthago now, have achieved nothing, but great efforts are feeing made against theRussian forces in the Feodosia area. Russian landings have taken place atEupatoria but are believed to have been repulsed.Conclusion. -23. Russian progress during the past week has been less than during anyweek since the German withdrawal began. The Russians are, however, veryconfident. It is too early to estimate the reason for the general slowing down ofthe offensive, but it may be due to increased German resistance and to thetemporary inability of the Russians to maintain effective pressure owing tocommunication difficulties and to any regrouping necessary to mount a furtheroffensive. ,;Libya.24. In the frontier area,,the garrison of Sollum village surrendered at0900 hours on the 12th January. The 6th South African Infantry Brigade hadcarried out on the previous day an action to cut it off from Halfaya. The enemyresistance was stout and resulted in some casualties to one South Africaninfantry battalion; We captured 137 Germans, including 5 officers and 125Italians, including 2 officers.25. The garrison at Halfaya is still holding out, though short of food andwater, which are being dropped by Ju. 52. aircraft daily. South African troopsconverging from the South-East and North-West are each within about four milesof the Pass. ,, . r&quot;.26. In Western Oyrenaica, after his evacuation of Jedabya on the7th January, General Rommel has been withdrawing steadily towards El AgheiJa
with our advanced troops, in contact with his rear guards. The latest informa-tion shows that he is on the defensive along the;approximate line Mersa Brega-Bir el Ginn-Maaten Belcleibat, with some infantry along the first 13 miles ofthe tract from Maaten Giofer to Marada, We are in contact along the,wholefront, but as yet no reports have been received as to the whereabouts .-&apos;of enemytanks. Enemy dive bombers have been active and have caused casualties amongour forward troops. &apos;        &apos; -27. The enemy is obtaining his supplies in M.T. from Tripoli, in smallships which discharge at points along the coast west of El Agheila and byaircraft from Italy, Sicily, Greece and Crete. Our interference with his linesof communication has been hampered by the weather, which has caused water-logged aerodromes in our forward area and bad visibility over targets. It ispossible that the enemy will stand in his present position, as there does not seemto be any position more suitable for defence in Eastern Tripolitania.28. Our own supply situation is slowly improving with the opening of theports of Derna, Tobruk and Benghazi, but there is a general shortage of lightersand small craft, which, together with bad weather, has hindered unloadingoperations. :Iraq and Persia.29. On the 12th January the command of all British and Indian land forcesin Iraq and Persia passed from C-in-C, India, to C-in-C, Middle East.The Far East. ,Malaya. . .      &apos; ;;30. At the beginning of the week the 11th Indian Division, considerablyreduced in numbers and equipment after five weeks of fighting, was heavilyengaged north of Kuala Lumpur. The aerodrome here was demolished by us onthe 9th January.31. The 9th Indian Division now protects the right flank of the 11th IndianDivision.   Both Divisions have withdrawn south of Kuala Lumpur.32. Further reinforcements arrived safely at Singapore on the 13th January.These included :  -53 Infantry Brigade Group.85 Anti-Tank Regiment, R.A.35 Light A.A. Regiment, R.A.6 Heavy A.A. Regiment, R.A.232 Hurricane Fighter Squadron, RAP. 7Netherlands East Indies.33. On the night of the 10th/11th January the Japanese launched a sea-borne attack on the island of Tarakan, one of the principal oilfields in DutchBorneo. After resisting for about 36 hours the garrison was overwhelmed, It ispresumed that the oil denial scheme, already well advanced, was completed bythe Dutch.34. A simultaneous attack was made on Minahassa area in North Celebeswhere, according to Dutch reports, fighting is still going on. The Japanese arestated to have used parachutists in their attack on Minahassa, but these reportsare still unconfirmed. ;;35. There has been an engagement between British and Japanese forcesnear the Sarawak-Dutch Borneo border, but no details are yet known.Philippines.36. The United States forces have been re-organised and are occupying adefensive position on Mapatang-Mount Nativ-Mauban, a line covering theBataan Peninsula, north-west of Manila. The United States front has beensubjected to heavy ground attacks and sustained air bombing. On the10th January an enemy attack on the Bataan Peninsula was repulsed with heavylosses. - -
37. In the South, enemy reinforcements have arrived at Davao, where theirforces are estimated at one division. The bulk of two Filipino divisions havearrived in this area, their Headquarters being established at Del Monte.Intelligence.Italy. . *&apos;38. While there have been a number of unconfirmed reports that Mussolinihas been asked by Hitler to send further Italian formations to the Russian front,no Italian reinforcements have so far been identified there. The ItalianExpeditionary Force in Russia is still estimated to consist of the 4-5 divisionswhich were sent there during the summer. Wounded Italians returning from theRussian front are reported to have spoken of the great hardships and heavy lossessuffered.Yugoslavia.39. There are indications that the Bulgarians have lately taken overresponsibility for a larger area of Yugoslavia south of Belgrade and that the6th, 7th and 17th Bulgarian Divisions (three of the five divisions for many monthslocated in Yugoslavia) have been brought up to strength. .Japan.40. It is estimated that, after meeting Commitments in the various theatresof operations, Japan can make six divisions immediately available for furtheroperations (one from Canton and Hong Kong area, two from Indo-China, threefrom Thailand). In addition, she can make a further eight divisions availableat short notice (four from North China, one from Central China, one fromFormosa, and, if the situation continues to remain the same in the north vis-a-visRussia, a further two divisions from Manchuria).AIR. SITUATION.General Review.41. . Brest was bombed on three nights. Heavy attacks were also made onWilhelmshaven and Hamburg.   ,Enemy attacks on Malta have continued.Operations in Libya were hampered by bad weather. *Enemy fighters escorted bombers in daylight attacks on Singapore.American and British aircraft in Burma carried out successful operationsagainst the Japanese.United Kingdom.42.   Fighter Command flew 1,257 sorties by day and 285 sorties by night.Our night fighters destroyed two enemy bombers and probably destroyedanother.Activity by the German Air Force was on a small scale, although greaterthan in the previous week. Two single-engined fighters crossed the coast, oneof which, engaged in photographic reconnaissance, crashed in Devonshire, thepilot being captured. On one night about 15 aircraft dropped bombs over wideareas in the Midlands. Other activity both by day and night was confined tocoastal operations.Germany and Occupied Territory.Night. t &apos;; &apos; V&apos;       &quot;... . &quot;&apos; :43.   Bomber Command despatched 616 sorties, compared with 508 last week;. 15 aircraft are missing, three of which were heavy bombers.  Weather conditionswere not generally favourable and on two nights operations were cancelled44. The principal effort was again directed against the enemy warships atBrest, the heaviest attack being on the night 8th/9th, when 116 aircraft dropped176 tons of H.E. bombs and 5,800 incendiaries; in two further raids a total of&apos;&apos;   - &apos;&apos;   [23349] &apos; - -     -      ^ : e - &apos;-&apos;
127 tons of HE. bombs were released. Bursts were seen across the docks andin the target area but cloud and the smoke screen prevented accurate observationof results.   .&apos;, .45. Wilhelmshaven was raided by 88 bombers, which dropped 105 tons ofHE. bombs (including eleven bombs of 4,000 lbs. and five of 1,900 lbs.) and 5,222incendiaries. The railway station is believed to have been hit and many largeand small fires were seen in the town and dock areas.&apos;1&apos; \ Hamburg was attacked by 54 aircraft, and bombs fell in the Blohm and Vossshipyards and amongst sheds between the docks, where some large fires werereported.Two attacks were carried out against Emden, and raids of a lighter scalewere made on the docks at Cherbourg and Rotterdam, and on enemy aerodromesin Holland.Day.46. Bomber Command did not carry out any daylight operations, andFighter Command despatched only 14 offensive sorties. The prevailing weatherconditions, which included some snow and sleet, were unfavourable for ouroperations.47. Two Spitfires shot up a factory south of Etaples and were attacked byfour F.W. 190s., two of which they destroyed. Two attacks by fighters were madeon coastal gun emplacements and casualties were inflicted on the personnel; somelarge barges were also attacked and hit.Coastal Operations.48. Coastal Command flew 20945 additional sorties on convoy escorts.Command involved 920 sorties.patrols (281 sorties) and despatchedShipping protection patrols by Fighter49. A Liberator on an anti-submarine patrol sighted a U-Boat in companywith a ship, 75 miles off Cape Finisterre. The U-Boat was attacked andstraddled by three depth charges as she dived, and the ship was also bombed withdepth charges. Two He. 115s. which interfered were damaged and forced towithdraw.On the night 10th/11th January a Hudson sighted an enemy convoy offthe Dutch coast and attacked one merchant vessel of about 6,000 tons from mastheight, obtaining a direct hit amidships. Another Hudson attacked a tanker of2,000 tons as a result of which flames spread all over the ship.50. Extensive photographic reconnaissances were flown, and the warshipsat Brest were kept under constant observation.51. A total of 20 aircraft were despatched to lay sea-mines off the FrisianIslands, Brest, Kiel harbour, Warnemunde and Heligoland Bight.52. Fighters engaged in protection of shipping shot down one Ju. 88 andprobably destroyed or damaged two others. : &quot; ,53. An outstanding feature of enemy daylight offensive operations wasincreased activity by reconnaissance units, particularly those whose normal areaof operations is in the North Sea off the Scottish coast. This, together wi hincreased activity by long-range bombers operating from Norway, some of whichmoved to that country at the time of the British landings on the 27th December,seems to indicate that a close watch is being kept on any movement of shippingin northern areas in the hope of forestalling any further attempts to land forcesin Norway.54. Apart from the above, daylight activity consisted of shipping andweather reconnaissances round our coasts; one successful attack was made onan East coast convoy.55. At night minelaying operations were carried out in the Liverpool area,the Thames Estuary and the Western Approaches. :
Mediterranean.Libya. -        . ., - ^56. Operations over the battle area were again hampered by bad weather.The aerodromes between Derna and Benghazi were waterlogged at the beginningof: the period.57. Dumps and transport between El Agheila and Sirte were bombed bothby day and by night. A very large oil fire followed an attack by Blenheims ohabout 250 M.T; west of El Agheila, and Wellingtons started a large fire amongdumps at Buerat El Hsun.: Blenheims, including aircraft of the Free French squadron, made continuousdaylight attacks on enemy positions at Halfaya. Many bursts were seen on gunpositions and M.T. vehicles, and two dumps were set on fire. Several nightattacks were also made, in order to interfere with the dropping of supplies byenemy aircraft, two of which were intercepted and driven oft.Four Blenheims, two of which were lost, bombed a merchant ship of 5,000tons off eastern Tunisia, but owing to heavy A.A. fire the success of the attackcould not be confirmed.    sTripoli (L) was attacked on five nights, though not by large forces. Amerchant ship was probably hit and a near miss was made on a destroyerentering the harbour. Bombs burst on the main quays and along the southernedge of the harbour, and three fires broke out at the railway station.58. Our fighters maintained a standing patrol over Benghazi harbour, andescorted coastal shipping.   Sweeps were flown over the battle area.Ten Kittyhawks destroyed seven, and probably a further four, of a formationof Italian fighters which were attacking our ground forces in the El Agheila area.On this occasion one Kittyhawk was lost, but in the course of combats withMe. 109s our losses in fighters during the week were somewhat greater than thoseof the enemy.A small ship off Buerat El Hsun was set on fire by Beaufighters.59. Enemy dive-bombers, escorted by fighters, made several attacks on 6Urground forces in the forward area. Tobruk was bombed on two nights, anddamage was done to an Ordnance Depot. Single aircraft attacked Benghazi,where bombs and mines were dropped.There was little activity over the Delta area.Malta.   &apos;60. Enemy attacks on Malta continued, but on a lighter scale than lastweek. On the 13th about 40 bombers and fighters took part, and on the followingday there were six attacks by a total of 51 aircraft which made use of cloudcover. Four of our aircraft were, destroyed on the ground, and Takali andHal Far aerodromes were made unserviceable. There was little other damageexcept to civilian property. Two enemy fighters and a bomber were destroyedand several others were damaged.Russia.61. On the Moscow front the German Air Force does not appear to havebeen able to interrupt the flow of Russian supplies across recaptured territory,nor to afford protection for retreating German columns from heavy and sustainedair attack.62. In the Crimea the air situation has deteriorated for the Germans asa result of their abandonment of the Kerch Peninsula where the Russianshave now regained possession of a fighter aerodrome. It is also believed thatthe Russians have been able to maintain their fighter aircraft at Sebastopol.   ,There are indications that the German Air Force has been obliged to sendreinforcements of long-range bombers to the Southern Front.The Far Bast.Malaya. . &apos; : -63. Buffaloes earried out photographic reconnaissances of enemy aero-dromes, and also, in co-operation with ground troops, reconnoitred the west coastof Malaya and the Kuala Selangor area.[23349] c 2
64. Dutch and British aircraft co-operated in patrols for the protection ofimportant convoys.65. Hudsons conducting a search for an enemy convoy 275 miles N.M.E. ofJohore attacked a vessel of 600 tons believed to be a Japanese wireless beam vessel;four direct hits were made, but, owing to the ship&apos;s heavy armour, no apparentdamage was caused. Dutch Glenn Martins scored near-misses on a 4,000-tonmerchant vessel at Kuantan.66. On the 9th January ten Vildebeestes attacked Ipoh aerodrome anddropped bombs on the runway and caused three fires, two of which appeared tobe blazing enemy aircraft. Four Catalinas bombed the railway yard andstorage buildings at Singora, after which several fires were observed in the targetarea, including a large one near military Headquarters. On the same day SungeiPatani aerodrome was attacked by three Blenheims, one of which failed to return,and five large fires were started. On the 13th a Blenheim bombed the oil storagecisterns at Port Swettenham.On the night 12th/13th January three Catalinas again attacked the railwaystation at Singora; one Catalina is missing.67. During the first four days of the week the main weight of Japaneseeffort was directed to the close support of ground troops and against our forwardcommunications. A mail train to Singapore was bombed at Tebong, and somecasualties resulted. Two merchant vessels off Muar (25 miles E.S.E. of Malacca)were attacked and one was sunk.68! On the 12th January three raids, involving a total of 120 bombers andfighters, were made on Singapore; altogether 54 Buffaloes intercepted the attacks,and destroyed six T. 97 fighters and probably destroyed four others; sixBuffaloes were shot down but four pilots were saved. On the following dayanother attack was made, by 50 heavy bombers escorted by 20 fighters. TwentyBuffaloes intercepted this raid, as a result of which one enemy bomber wasprobably destroyed, two others damaged, and five Buffaloes were shot down, thepilots of four being saved. .An attack by nine enemy bombers on the town and aerodrome at Batu Pahat(30 miles south-west of Kluang) resulted in one of the attackers being destroyedand two others seriously damaged by AA. fire. One Buffalo was destroyed onthe ground, but the aerodrome was not seriously damaged. Enemy aircraft alsobombed and machine-gunned Segamat (47 miles north-west of Kluang), damagingbuildings and causing some service casualties.Burma.69. On the night 7th/8th January ten Blenheims attacked the harbour andcommercial dockyard at Bangkok; all bombs fell in the target area, and oneextensive fire was started.Three raids made on Mehsod aerodrome by American and British fightersresulted in the destruction of seven enemy bombers and three fighters, and theprobable destruction of another fighter. At Raheng aerodrome two bombers weredestroyed and four others damaged.  One American Tomahawk is missing.70. Buffaloes carrying out reconnaissance duties shot down one Ju. 87 nearTavoy, attacked barracks and launches 50 miles N.E. of Victoria, and severelydamaged two aircraft on the ground and blew up a railway engine near PrachubKirikhund (150 miles south of Bangkok).71. Small forces of enemy bombers attacked Rangoon, and Mingaladon andMpulmein aerodromes, but the damage caused was relatively small.Borneo.72. The aerodrome at Kuching is still being repaired and no aircraft havebeen observed there yet. Reconnaissance on the 9th January showed that, of52 craters on the airfield, only nine had been filled in.Tarakan, in north-east Borneo, was bombed on the 9th and 10th Januaryprior to the landing of the Japanese troops there.
Philippine Islands 1 - ,.73. Reports from the Philippines indicate that the chief enemy aerialactivity was against Corregidor. On the 4th, 5th and 7th, 52, 50 and 45 aircraftrespectively bombed the fortress. Some of these raiders have been reported to beArmy T. 97 heavy bombers, of which four squadrons are believed to be based inFormosa. Later little or no activity was reported. It is probable that weatherconditions were unfavourable.Pacific.74. In addition to the attack on Vunakanau aerodrome (New BritainIsland) on the 6th January, reported in Resume No. 123, two raids were madeon the 4th by 22 and 11 naval heavy bombers; it was also raided on the 7th by18 naval heavy bombers.The aircraft may have operated from Truk or from Kapinga Marangi.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day. \75. On the 13th bombs were dropped on Redcar, where slight damage wasdone to the Iron Works of Messrs. Dorman Long &amp; Co., and at Lowestoft, whereseveral shops were destroyed and many damaged. On other days there was someminor bombing in Aberdeenshire and the Shetlands.By Night,76. On the night of 10th/11th scattered and ineffective bombing occurredin the North-West, North-East and Eastern Counties and over the Midlands.Slight damage was caused to pipe lines of Shell Mex and B.P.
