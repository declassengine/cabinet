THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1942.&quot; &apos; &quot;-;-:---- - - ;-.)-SECRET- CopyNo, 31W.P. (42) 57. 1    &apos;^&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;February 2, 1942.WAR CABINETIRISH POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I circulate for the information of the War Cabinet a copy of amemorandum from the United Kingdom Representative to Eire, reporting on arecent interview with Mr. de Valera and containing his comments on the generalsituation.C.(Secret.)Memorandum on Irish Policy received from the United Kingdom, Representative to Eire.IN these days it is not easy to take long views, and a short view of the courseof events in Ireland to-day can stir no other emotion except disappointment. Buta long-range trend is now plainly perceptible, and as it is working strongly inour favour its significance should not be overlooked and action which mightimpede it should, if possible, be avoided.It is natural that attention should be focussed on the grave detriment we:have suffered from our short-sighted action in 1938 in ceding the Irish portsand from Mr. de Valera&apos;s refusal to endanger his policy of neutrality by accordingfacilities to us. The course of the war may force this grave issue to the forefrontat any moment. In that issue there is dynamite which would shatter the basis, ofto-day&apos;s relationships and forecasts.It is, however, worth while pointing out that if we exclude that issue from oursurvey there are certain factors in the present working of Irish neutrality whichare far from detrimental to us in the field of our war effort. In the war of1914-18 Ireland, though in the war, was a constant source of anxiety. TheRebellion of 1916 was highly damaging to us in many ways, and we eould neverguess the scope of the subversive activities which came to the surface from timeto time. To-day that burden is carried by Mr. de Valera&apos;s Government, who havetheir own &quot;Frankenstein&quot; on their hands. There is always a &quot;dynamite&quot;group in Ireland. Several hundreds of revolutionaries are behind barbed wiredo-day, desperate men who are to-day the enemies of the de Valera Government;Mr; die Valera has asserted time and again that he will not allow a free Irelandto be a basis for attacks on England. His only hope of maintaining his neutralposition is to-execute that promise and we shall keep him under constant pressureto that end. To-day this particular anxiety is his, not ours, and clearly itimposes responsibilities more easily undertaken by a native Government. &quot; Thedog of the country hunts the hare of the country.&quot;&apos;[23408]
The following factors may be enumerated as helpful to us in our wareffort :-(a) The extremists here are under control and it is worth adding that if\y.  ,.      they were not under control in the South they soon would be in violenteruption in the North.  In fact, to-day the danger of political expib-sion in Ireland is far greater in the North than in the South.,,     (6) Axis activities and intrigues here are closely supervised by the Govern-&apos;( ment of Eire.  With their concurrence we have certain methods ofco-operation which need not be specified.  In fact, broadly speaking,we know what is going on, and the importance of this must be under-      jlined, in view of our experiences in the last war.  To-day we are far, more exposed to such risks owing to the German occupation of theshores of Prance confronting the long coasts of Ireland.(c) Through the coastal watch and ward and by co-operation in radiodetection service we have a system of intelligence which works for ourpurposes.(d) Whenever possible, i.e., when the principle of neutrality is not publiclyand violently outraged, the Eire authorities endeavour to solve theproblems which the war brings in a manner favourable to us (strandedaircraft, deserters, &amp;c).(e) Eecruiting for our armed forces and for our labour requirements is nothampered and, indeed, is largely facilitated.(/) We have a close and confidential working liaison between our MilitaryStaff and the Eire High Command and joint plans are worked out tomeet any German attack upon Eire.If we can maintain this position the trend of events is likely to continuestrongly in our favour for more reasons than one. It is obvious to world opinionthat if Germany had been faced with our problem in Eire she would have actedwith instant ruthlessness. Through many generations the problem of Ireland hasbrought us trouble at home and criticism abroad. To-day, if we are fortunate, wemay be able to use Ireland as the symbol and standard of what Britain standsfor to-day. This policy has kept Ireland neutral, but it has also made Irelandpro-British. This may be a factor of immense significance at the PeaceConference when we proclaim the principles of fundamental democracy.What is Mr. de Valera&apos;s long-range policy for Eire 1 Is it not obvious that,whatever it was, it has gone with the wind ? He is left to day with a short-rangepolicy modelled on the hedgehog. The ambitious nationalist de Valera policywhich owed its strength to the fact that he could make the world ring with thetale of Irish grievances and of Irish resistance to British tyranny and which gavehim a world congregation, particularly in America where is that to-day ?The fact is that we can see the Irish Question dissolving before our eyes. Heis leading the country into nullity. I can see no possible bargaining position forDublin after the war as regards Partition or anything else. If we hold a steadycourse these developments can shortly be utilised for the crash of the de ValeraGaelic sanctuary and for the re-establishment of at least strategic unity of ourisland group. But, meanwhile, we must sharpen none of the old issues and putno flaming sword in anybody&apos;s hands here.If the course of the Battle of the Atlantic should unhappily force us to raisethe grave issue of the &quot; ports &quot; we must remember, in assessing the advantagesto be gained from the use of such facilities, the disadvantages we shall incurfrom an Ireland split into violent factions, from the opening of many doors tosabotage and espionage and from a long coast line and a sky no longer held infriendly surveillance. These disadvantages would arise even in the mostfavourable circumstances, namely, with a Government established here which hadagreed to provide us with the required facilities. Furthermore, we should haveto carry the immense burden of equipping this country to meet all forms of Axis &amp;aggression. ;, It is a curious indication of the extreme narrowness of Mr. de Valera soutlook an outlook shared by the vast majority of the people of this country that America should now be the target of bitter criticism and ill will. This is forus a useful factor in the long-range trend of events. The long chapter of &quot; sevenhundred years of aggression&quot; is ending. The Irish patriot has always glaredupon England through the one and only loophole of his fortress.  Now we are to
have a respite. When realisation dawns fully upon the business men and practicalcitizens of this country, when they see that Mr. de Valera&apos;s strait and narrowpath has led them to Coventry, there will be a powerful reaction. Then let usfiope we shall be able to regard Ireland with stolid indifference arid wait to seeif Dublin has any proposals to make worthy of our attention.It remains to consider what action on our part is necessary while the situationis developing.   In the first place there are strong arguments which I need notfrepeat for furnishing the Eire army with sufficient equipment to keep them in Igood heart.  As regards the trade supplies necessary to the country&apos;s normal or fsub-normal existence, the position has altered with Americans entry into the war. jUntil America came in we had to be most careful in our handling of this question.The Irish-American group formed a powerful and sensitive element in theIsolationist opposition to President Roosevelt&apos;s policy.   That difficulty is nowout of the way and our long trend policy will be best served by reducing oursupplies of all kinds to a minimum forthwith.   Developments in the Pacificfurnish an obvious and a genuine justification.   Our action can and should betaken without malice.   The logical consequence of Mr. de Valera&apos;s policy is toreduce Eire to a state of friendless beggardom. We shall not move into a happierand saner relationship until this fact is brought home to the people of Ireland.An acute shortage in the field of supplies is now developing and nothing shouldbe done to mitigate it, except in return for definite services.   It is conceivablethat it might suit us to give a quid fro quo in order to have fuller use of theman-power and food potential of a neutral Eire.Since recording the above note I have had a long talk with Mr. de Valera.I was reporting to him the arrival of the first American contingent in NorthernIreland, and as stated in my telegram No. 8* I found him deeply depressed by thefact that things are not working out as he would have wished. Neutrality, whichwas to have been a proud banner on the march to Irish unity and Irish worldinfluence, has in fact proved to be an emblem of impotence and is now pointingthe way to a general slump in esteem and in welfare.He went so far as to say that he could now see only one hope of rallying aunited people and overcoming the growing difficulties, and that was by Germanymaking an attack upon Eire. He did not wish for such a thing. He could notwish for it. But it would be a solution. Nevertheless, pro-Ally as he was inregard to the war, let there by no doubt that if America and England laid violenthands upon Eire they would meet with 100 per cent, opposition, and any holdwe effected would be subject to unceasing attacks. Nothing could be more tragicthan for him to find himself fighting upon the,wrong side.I said that we must hope that such a situation would not arise, but that, ifit did, I doubted his estimate as to the strength of the opposition which wouldbe encountered. I went on to say that I could not understand why he did notnow seek the other obvious way out. For my own part, I should never ceasehoping for the day when he would bring Ireland into closer co-operation with us.That was his real way out. The future for Ireland was very dark. America,suffering from unprovoked attack, in a death grip with her Yellow Peril, hadno doubt that Eire could help her in the hour of her need. If that help waswithheld, where would Eire stand ? Mr. de Valera spoke of defencelessness, butI said that these deficiencies could be made good and would, indeed, have to beinstalled as a condition precedent. Moreover, I did not think that the bombingof cities would continue on the same scale as hitherto. Mr. de Valera said that,if he were Hitler and Eire joined the ranks of his enemies, the first thing he -would do would be to bomb Dublin, Cork and Lirherick. However, he desired tostress the point that the policy of Eire was not based on any cowardly instincts,and I said that I knew full well that this was the case, and he then pointed to thesignificance of the number of Irishmen who had gone over to join the BritishForces, many because of real sympathy with our cause; he added that it had beenthe policy of his Government to put no difficulty in the way of this recruitment.We had some talk about the course of the war, and he expressed the viewthat, though the Russians had undoubtedly dealt the Germans heavy blows in thecentral zone, the firm holding of the two pivots of the line,. i.e., at the north andmore particularly the southern extremity, was very significant. If the Russians&quot;could regain the Crimea, it would be an outstanding success.   Otherwise, he* Copy annexed.
feared that the Germans would be able to revive their pincer strategy and reopentheir southern drive in the spring.In further general conversation, he again stressed his feelings for our causeand said that he realised that we had done our best to avert the war, and thatfinally we had had no choice.The most interesting feature of the conversation was that I was able to sayso much, without provoking the usual violent reactions, in urging that decencyand self-interest required Eire to stand in line with America and ourselves. Itis clear that he has given thought to this line of action, and I said that I hopedthe day would come when we should have him with us. I also said that what wefelt even more than the strategic mischief of his abstention was the fact that heand the Irish people and all they stood for were missing from the fight. He said,somewhat wearily, that he could well understand that feeling.&apos; In short, tne position remains the same, but he is troubled in spirit.Meanwhile, in the country at large Neutrality is no longer merely a policy. Ithas become a principle, almost a faith. Its economic and human consequenceshave not yet made themselves felt.J. L. MAFFEY.January 27,1942.Telegram from United Kingdom Representative to Eire to Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, dated January 26, 1942.(No. 8.   Secret.)Reference your telegram No. 9,* I made the required communication toMr. de Valera at noon to-day. He told me that the fact that American troopsare coming to Northern Ireland is generally known, and I explained the reasonfor my personal communication and for its being necessarily delayed. Theprospect of having American forces in Northern Ireland is, of course, thoroughlydistasteful to him. He said that the fact of a portion of the soil of Ireland beingused as territory at free disposal would mean deep and general resentment. Hewould have to register his position in some way or another. Some pronounce-ment would be expected from him on a matter which touched such grave issues.I suggested the less said the better, and told him that he would be doing moreharm than good by saying anything that might antagonize American sentimentor start recriminations. I said that the de facto position in Northern Irelandwas as clear as a pikestaff to-day; the action taken was purely military and didnot change any feature in the constitutional landscape. We had a long andfriendly talk of more than an hour on various aspects of the question and of thewar generally. He said that he would bear my views in mind, and I left feelingthat he would not handle the matter otherwise than delicately. Mr. de Valeraseemed to me to show signs of being more worried than I have ever known himbefore in regard to the prospects, now confronting his country. He said thatthings were not working out at all as he would have wished and that he could notsee the future hopefully. I said that Mr. Winston ChurchilFs private messageto him of the 8th December seemed to me to suggest the only satisfactory way out.He took this extremely mildly, and merely went over the usual list of difficulties.But I would not suggest that there was any indication whatsoever on his part ofany idea of reconsidering the policy he has adopted,* Not reproduced. It related to the time at which the communication to Mr. de Valerashould be made. i
