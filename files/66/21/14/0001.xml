CYPHER TELEGRAMFROM:    AUSTRALIAv(PRIME MINISTER)TO:        PRIME MINISTERD. 24th Jan. , 1.942, 5.0 a.m.R,    24th   &quot; &quot;     12,5 a.ra.MOST IMMEDIATE0JOHCU No, 21 MOST SECRET..I am communicating the following message as theresult of an emergency meeting of the War Cabinet: summoned todayto consider reports on the situation in Malaya and New Guinea,Part 1, Malaya,.10     The General. Officer Commanding the Australian ImperialForces Malaya reports that part of his force has been cut offwithout the possibility of relief,      It would appear frominformation received regarding the disposition of the A.I0Ftand its operations -$iat support for it has not been forthcoming,20     Whilst we have no intention of suggesting anycriticism of the Indians who are fighting the common foe, weare greatly disturbed by references made by the General OfficerCommanding the-ix. I.F, to their unsuitability for this type ofwarfares.     If this is correct, we hope that you are not placingtoo much reliance on the mere numerical strength of the landforces you are sending without regard to their qualities,30     Page has rex^orted that the Defence Committee has beenconsidering the evacuation of Malaya and   Singapore,-     After allthe assurances we have given? the evacuation of Singapore wouldbe regarded here and elsewhere as an inexcusable betrayal,Singapore is a central fortress in the system of the Empire andlocal defence.     As stated in my telegram No,17.we understoodthat it was to be made impregnable and in any event it was tobe capable of holding out for a prolonged period until thearrival of the main fleet,4.     Even in an emergency diversion of reinforcementsshould be to the Netherlands East Indies and not Burma.Anything else would be deeply resented and might force theNetherlands East Indies to make a separate peace,. -5,............ On the faith of the proposed flow of reinforcements,,we have acted and carried out our part of the bargain.     Weexpect you not to frustrate the whole purpose by evacuation.Part 2. The Pacific?,6*      The heavy scale of the Japanese attack on Rabaul,where including other parts of the Bismarck Archipelago thereis a force of 1,700, and the probability of its occupation,if  ,&apos;ich has not already occurred, presages an early attack onPort Moresby,

7c.      The strength of the Australi&amp;n td^op^ s.t Port Moresbyis 5y500o      Great iimortajoee-J.*s -ati-s.ched to this ccn.it. s.-o-      ov..^Chiefs of Staff as-- it is the only base in this region fromwhich control ean be exercised of the Torres Straits, which isthe most direct line of supply to Darwin, the Netherlands EastIndies and Malaya,- for which it is &quot;being extensively used.In the absence of Rabaul, port Moresby is also a base for .offensive operations against the Caroline and Marshall Islands -when British and American strength permits of counter offensiveaction,80     We have information at the present moment that aUnited States naval force consisting of 2 carriers, 5 8-inchcruisersj 1 -6-inch cruiser and 3 destroyers is carrying out asweep from Samoa towards the Gilbert Islands.     Such anoperation if carried on towards the Japanese bases in theMarshalls will, by threatening their flank, form a valuablediversion from the Japanese southwards advance from liabaui^ andwould be a great help to usa     Chief of the Naval Staff ofAustralia is communicating direct With the Commander-in-chief. -of the Pacific.Fleet following the arrangements relating to theAnzac area, offering our forces and seeking his co-operationin this offensive action against the Japanese.      The assistanceof yourself and your, naval advisers in influencing such a moveon tlxe part of the Americans would be most helpfulo90     Our advisers state that submarines would form a mostvaluable addition to the defence of Port Moresby, where thereis overy facility for their operation, and it is requestedthat if possible some may. be allotted to that base.IOo       We are in full agreement with the concludingsentence of the New Zealand reply on the Anssac area to theeffect that unified command over all naval forces engaged inthv war against Japan and. the eventual formation of a fleetsuperior to the Japanese capable of wresting from our enemies-the command of the Western Pacific remains essential to thedefeat of Japane    We expect that the best immediate measureswill be taken to remedy the situation.Part. ,3.a^ Aircraft.llo      Our experiences at Ambon and Rabaul have emphasisedthe urgent necessity for fighter aircraft immediately0Japanese methods make it clear that without fighter protectionfor our aerodromes, there is every prospect of carrier borneenemy air attack destroying our extremely limited striking forceon the ground by low attack, designed to search out individualaircraft.     These tactics may be practised with impunity bythe enemy against our mainland aerodromes as well as at theadvanced bases, owing to the lack, of fighter protection andthe almost complete abssnce of gun defences,,     A request ismade for immediate allotment to the RoAoA0P. of 250 fighteraircraft of the-Tomahawk, Hurricane 2 or similar type0.120      It is impossible to expect us to give effectiveresistance with the inadequate aircraft at our disposal,,moreover desire the allotment to the H0A0A0Fo of United Statesair-craft of suitable types, which are already in Australia orare likely to arrive shortlyc     This course would be insubstitution of the aircraft long since ordered for the EoA0AoF0expansion programme but not yet delivered from the UnitedStates,,

13c    Your support of the above proposal with&quot;the UnitedStates authorities is requested, together with&quot;an immediatearrangement for the allocation to the R.A.A.F. for use atPort Moresby of a :squadron of United States P*40 fighteraircraft approaching completion at Townsvillee     Breretonhas communicated this request to the Commander.in Chief of theA.B.D.-A. Area, for whose area the aircraft are intended; butwe ask that the authority of the controlling General Wavell(sic).should direct that it be approvedc149    The trend of the situation in Malaya and the attackon Rabaul are giving rise to a public feeling of graveuneasiness at Allies impotence to do anything to stem theJapanese advance.     The Government in realising itsresponsibility to prepare the public for the&apos; possibility ofresisting an aggressor, also has a duty and obligation toexplain why it may not have been possible to &quot;prevent the enemyreaching our shores.     It is therefore in duty bound to exhaustall the possibilities of the situation, the.-more so since theAustralian people, having volunteered for service overseas inlarge numbers, find it difficult to understand why they mustwait&apos;so long for an improvement in the situation whenirreparable damage may have been done to their power to resist?the prestige of the Empire and the solidarity of the Allied      &apos;^e--
