(42) 17thConclusions, Minute 5.A, E.- ; Foreign Office, February 8, 1942.Draft Telegram to Viscount Halifax (Washington).^No.     &apos;. Most Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, February    ,1942.! MY telegram No. 6707 of the 4th December last gave you an account of thecircumstances which led up to my visit to Moscow later in that month and ofline I proposed to take in my conversations with Stalin. From the repetitionsSent to you of my telegrams from Moscow in the Hectic series you have an ideaof what passed during those conversations. United States Government have alsobeen kept informed of situation through you and through United StatesAmbassador here.) 2. Since my return from Moscow we have been considering ways and meansof dealing with Stalin&apos;s demand for recognition of his 1941 frontiers in Finland,the Baltic States and Roumania. The United States Government may wellconsider his demand difficult to understand, for if, at the end of the war, heOccupies these territories, it is not to be supposed that we should turn him out, and,if he does not, he cannot expect that we shall prolong hostilities to install himthere. It is our belief, however, that his demand-an awkward one to satisfy is put to us as a test of sincerity of our avowed desire to work With him duringand after the war. It is the fruit of a long period of suspicion andinisunderstanding.3. A simple refusal to meet him would, involve the risk that Anglo-Sovietrelations will deteriorate and that co-operation between Great Britain andRussia, and between the United States of America and Russia, both during andafter the war, may be seriously endangered.&apos; 4. In Moscow T had to tell Stalin that it was altogether beyond my powerto accede to his request, and I explained to him that this was due not only to ourposition but also to that of the United States, to whom we were bound by certainundertakings, apart from our joint promulgation of the Atlantic Charter. Underpressure from Stalin I could not refuse to consult the United States Government,and I therefore wish you now to put the whole situation before them so that wemay determine our joint policy in the matter.::&quot; &apos;11631&apos; [23444]
5., Stahn&apos;s attitude is that, before Hitler forced him into war by an.(unjustified aggression, he was in possession of these territories. He wouldaamtain that his title to them is no more open to question than was that of theTsarist Government, (with whom we were in treaty and &quot;friendly relations). He/asks that the frontiers which Hitler violated shall be restored. (Note that thePolish-Soviet frontier is not at the moment in question.) He says, by implicationif not in so many words, that he would expect an Ally to allow him, who has beenbearing the brunt of the war for seven months, to expect to regain his ownterritory. I do not want to overstate his case : there are obvious answers, whichdo not carry much weight with him. . . .. .6. I used the Atlantic Charter as an argument against him. He pointedto the &quot; plebiscites &quot; in the Baltic States. Our exchanges of views on this,aspect of the subject would have been even less profitable than they were if I hadsuggested that those &quot; plebiscites&quot; were faked.7. But there is the difficulty. Is it possible to comply with StahVs demaridwithout doing violence to the Atlantic Charter, and without raising a crop ofother demands from other quarters ? If so, that is, from the point of view of therelations of our two countries with the Soviet Government, the solution weshould seek.8. If we cannot, is it wise to offer Stalin a part, only, of what he wants?I am advised by Sir S. Cripps (and our experience of 1939, as you will remember,would tend to confirm this) that any appearance of haggling may only increasehis suspicions.   But I am apprehensive of the effect of a flat negative.9. If the United States Government feel that it is impossible to grant hisfull demand, despite its very real significance for co-operation with the Soviet.Government, now and in the future, are there any other offers that we could make ?10.   I would make two possible suggestions : (a) We might say that, while we cannot agree now to restoration of 1941frontiers, we and the United States could immediately give assurancesthat on grounds of Soviet security we would support, when the timecomes, a demand by the Soviet Government to establish. Soviet basesin territories contiguous to Russia and especially on the Baltic andBlack Seas from which her security might be threatened. Acceptanceby Soviet Government of such assurances would not preclude themfrom putting forward at the peace conference their claim to absorb theBaltic States, Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina and parts ofFinland. We and the United States Government for our part wouldremain free from any previous undertaking either to accept or rejectsuch a claim if put forward at the peace settlement. (Idea of establish-ment of military bases by one country in territory of another is onewhich United States Government itself has put into operation. It isone which may be developed after the war by various countries andit is one which Soviet Government in the case of the Baltic Statesin 1939 was the first to put into practice. While giving Stalin tangibleasset in respect of his security needs, it does not derogate fromprinciples of Atlantic Charter.)(b) We might put forward proposal in your letter to the Prime Ministerof 11th January (see W.P. (42) 48, paragraph 10 (B)), substitutingfollowing final passage: &quot;. . . . and in order to reconcile yoursecurity requirements and our common obligations under AtlanticCharter, we would undertake here and now to support you at the peacesettlement if you demand that foreign policy in defence of BalticStates shall be entrusted to Soviet Union, who for this purpose shallbe entitled to exercise such authority and to establish such control asmay be necessary on territory of Baltic States.&quot;11. These two offers are based, as any offers clearly must be, on requirementsof Russian &quot;security,&quot; for which Soviet Union have been striving ever since1917 Revolution in order that Soviet Government may be enabled to completeunfinished social and economic experiment within Russia without danger offoreign intervention or war.12. Of these two, it seems to me there might be a possibility of the UnitedStates Government being prepared to agree to (a), and if they would associatethemselves with it, it might be that this would satisfy Stalin.   He might hoi
saccept any compromise offer from us alone, but.it is possible that he might feellhat a joint offer by ourselves and the United States Government was of real valueand a step towards co-operation during and after the war with our twoGovernments. Moreover (a) would not exclude the possibility of Stalin obtainingat the peace conference the frontiers he desires : it would be an instalment ratherthan an alternative.13. One point of difficulty is Lithuania, since Polish Government who areanxious for a Polish-Lithuanian union after the war, have expressed to us desirethat no negotiation as regards future disposal of Lithuanian territory should.-beentered into without consultation with them. Polish views are of courseincompatible with Soviet plans to annex Lithuania and with proposal (b), thoughit might be reconciled with proposal (a). In any case Poland&apos;s aim in regard toLithuania is only practical from geographical point of view if she obtained f rdfnSoviet Government frontier with Russia considerably east&quot; of &quot;Curzon line&apos;orpermission to annex East Prussia, to which M. Stalin told me he would be preparedto agree, Poland has no-rights in Lithuania on the basis of the Atlantic Chalrfer&amp;nd she will be unwise to show herself intransigent towards Russia in Lithuanianmatters. -.; 14. It would not do to make any concession to Stalin without requiring-suitable quid pro quo and by insisting on any concessions made to him being partof bargain we should establish rule that concession must be mutual, thus makingit more difficult for Soviet Government to press subsequently for yet furtherconcessions.  Demands we might make on Soviet Government are :-;       (i) Recognition of our right on grounds of security to establishment ofbases on European continent, thus-reaffirming views expressed to me...    ...   by Stalin about British bases in France, Belgium, Holland, Norwayand Denmark.(ii) Affirmation by Soviet Government that they will base their policy onprinciples contained in declaration by President Roosevelt and PrimeMinister that they &apos;&apos; seek no aggrandisement, territorial or other,&apos;&apos; andM. Stalin&apos;s statement on the 6th November, 1941, that Soviet Govern--;: - - ment had no intention of interfering in internal affairs of otherpeople.\ (Hi) Formal Soviet approval of principle of confederation as applied to&apos; weaker countries of Europe, especially in Balkans and as regardsPoland and Czechoslovakia,(iv) Undertaking by Soviet Government to collaborate with His Majesty&apos;sr Government and the United States Government and other countries; of Europe in preparing for reconstruction of Europe after the war&quot;with full regard to each other&apos;s interests and in accordance withi the two principles (see (ii) above) of no aggrandisement and nointerference.&quot; Objectives of reconstruction would includesafeguarding and strengthening of economic and politicalindependence of all European countries, either as unitary orconfederated States, and reconstruction of industrial and economiclife of countries whose territories have been overrun by Germany orher associates.15. Should President agree to tripartite basis of agreement, he may haveUnited States desiderata to put forward.16. My immediately following telegram contains analysis of wider issuesinvolved which you may find useful in discussion with the President.Draft Telegram to Viscount Halifax (Washington).(No.     .  Most Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, February    , 1942.ON the assumption that Germany is defeated, that German military strengthis destroyed and that France remains for a considerable period at least a weakPower, there will be no counterweight to Russia in Europe, but co-operation withRussia will be desirable (a) because she might otherwise be tempted to collaborate with Germany, inview of historical tendency to and economic urge for these Powers tbwprk together; &apos;
;      (6) in order that we may re-create in our own interest balance of powerEurope, destroyed by collapse of France, against possibility of rdvived ;Germany; ; &quot;    &apos;:     (c) in Order that,\militarily speaking, Germany should be encircled.2. Probable course of Soviet policy must depend upon course of war and itseffect upon U.S.S.R., condition in which latter emerges from war and circuni-stances in which war is terminated. We cannot be certain that Germaii defeafemay not be brought about principally by Russian action before our owk andAmerican war potential is fully developed. In that event Russian prestige wouldbe enormous and Soviet Government would be tempted to work for establishmentof Communist Governments in majority of European countries. Russians might,moreover, be in a position to denude German factories of equipment needed torestore Russian industry and becoming in this way to considerable extentindependent of British and American assistaneermight no longer desire td adaptthemselves to policies which we and the United States may wish to pursue. Thi$possible development is in itself a powerful reason for establishing close relationswith Russia while her policy is still in a fluid state in order to exercise as muchinfluence as possible on her future course of action. It would be unsafe to gambleon Russia emerging so exhausted . from the war that she will be forced tocollaborate with us without our having to make any concessions to her. On thecontrary, common prudence requires us to lay our plans on the assumption that,if we want Russian collaboration after the war, we shall have to be prepared tomake such a policy advantageous to her. Application of this policy will belaborious and lengthy process. If we are to adopt it, we must start now, and notwait until the war is over. ,3. We must therefore recognise that our refusal to satisfy Stalin&apos;s demandmay be the end of any prospect of fruitful co-operation with the SovietGovernment in our mutual interests, and may cause Soviet policy to revert to thepursuit of purely selfish aims with incalculable consequences for the post-wafperiod. There is also important point of particular and immediate interest toUnited States, that our present answer to StalinV demand may later on affectRussian decision whether or no to make war on Japan. &apos;&quot;4. There is little doubt that Soviet Government is suspicious lest our policy,of close collaboration with United States Government will be pursued at expenseof Russian interests and that we aim at an Anglo-American peace and-post-war world. Soviet Government will therefore be likely to use opr responseto Stalin&apos;s demand as touchstone of Anglo-American attitude towards them.It.seems to us that right method both of meeting this suspicion and of guardingso far as may be possible against risk of. Russia following entirely independentpolicy is to emphasise to Soviet Government that, in matters concerning warand peace aims, we and the United States Government would wish to work fortripartite consultations with them and to reach tripartite solutions.5. It must be remembered that Stalin might have asked for much more^e.g\, control of the Dardanelles, spheres of influence in the Balkans, one-sidedimposition on Poland of Russo-Polish frontier, access to Persian Gulf, accessto Atlantic involving cession of Norwegian territory. Stalin&apos;s present demand^it is true, may not be final, but he may later be in a position1 to enforce a claimto some or all of these, and we and United States Government would be instronger position to assert our views if we have established precedent of tripartiteagreements in regard to post-war arrangements, and if Soviet Government havenot decided to go ahead without regard to our views owing to our giving anentirely negative reply to present demands. Moreover, from strategic point ofview, it may well be sound that Russia should be established once again in theBaltic so as to be able better to dispute with Germany the naval command of thatsea. than was the case since 1918. Stalin would certainly not admit that hisdemands are in conflict with principles of Atlantic Charter, and he may well foesatisfied by nothing short of complete acceptance of his demands.  :,     -   &apos;
