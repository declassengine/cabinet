February 1942.Copy Hq. 3WAR CABINET.SITUATION IN NEW ZEALAND SHORTLY AFTER THE OUTBREAKOF WAR WITH JAPAN.Memorandtim by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I think the following account by the United Kingdom High Commissionerof the way in which the outbreak of war with Japan was received in New Zealand.will be of interest to the War Cabinet.0.   ,Dominions Office, February 5, 1942. ,Office of the High Commissioner(No. 189.  Confidential.) for the United Kingdom,My Lord, Wellington, N.Z., December 20, 1941.IT may be of interest to you to receive a brief account of the way in whichthe outbreak of war with Japan was received in New Zealand.2. Thanks to a belief in the ability and readiness of the United States toprotect its little brother^ the feeling that &quot;it can&apos;t happen here&quot; has been :general in New Zealand, even during the darkest hours of 1940. This feelingwas not immediately shaken by Japan&apos;s entry into the war. On the part of themore thoughtful members of the community there was no doubt a realisation ofwhat this extension of the war might mean to New Zealand. The great majority,however, appeared to be principally concerned to forestall the further cut inthe petrol ration which was expected as a result of the emergency. Outwardly,,the reception of the news in New Zealand was signalised by a rush not to thecolours but to the petrol pumps.3, The sinking of the Prince of Wales and the Repulse, coming on top ofan increasing realisation of the extent of the United States naval disaster atHawaii, effectively shattered this atmosphere, at all events for the time being.The public was suddenly roused to the fact that the cities of New Zealand wereexposed to the risk of a more or less serious raid by Japanese cruisers, or bybombers flown from Japanese aircraft carriers, and that, buildings being verylargely made of wood, the task of fire-fighting would be by no means easy.Though there was never any trace of panic, it would, I think, be true to saythat the. events at Pearl Harbour and off the coast of Malaya caused the manin the street here for the first time to feel the war in the pit of his stomach.4. The members of the Government from the beginning realised thepotential danger of the situation, and the War Cabinet has been in almostcontinuous session. On the Sunday when war broke out both the Governor-General and the Prime Minister were absent from Wellington, but both madeimmediate arrangements to return.   On the morning after his return His[23435]SECRET.W.P. (42) 67./February 5, 1J&amp;42.
Excellency was asked to preside at a special meeting of the War Cabinet in orderthat the members might have the benefit of his knowledge and experience. Atthis Cabinet it was decided I understand largely at the instance of theGovernor-General- to summon Parliament immediately. In the meantime theLeader of the Opposition issued an appeal for the formation of a NationalGovernment. No response has been made to this appeal, which appears for the.time being to have raised no public interest. -5. On the meeting of Parliament on the 11th December, the Prime Ministermade an appeal to the people of New Zealand, which unfortunately, was notso prominently reported in the local press as it should have been, warning themof the; dangers threatening the country and of the necessity for the most drasticsteps to meet the new emergency. The House then went into secret session tillthe following evening, when Parliament was adjourned until the 5th February,or such earlier date as might be deemed desirable. I understand that the mostvaluable part of the proceedings was an informal talk between Members ofParliament and the Chiefs of Staff.6. Though the Prime Minister in his speech declared that &quot; the countrymust go on to a war footing, not only in respect of the fighting services but incivilian life as well &apos;&apos; thus by implication admitting that it had not yet goneon to such a footing no suggestion was made that the process might involve thesuspension of the luxury of a 40-hour week. The main steps taken to meet theemergency so far announced are the advancement from the 10th January to the15th December of the entry of Territorials into annual training camps; thelimitation of the Christmas holidays of munition workers; the cancellation ofexcursion trains for the Christmas holidays; and the drastic curtailment of theuse of petrol for non-essential purposes. Of these not very impressive measures,that which has most struck the public is the announcement that no petrol willbe made available until further notice for pleasure or any purposes not regardedas absolutely essential in the public interest. There have been no protests againstthis decision, the effects of which were immediately reflected in the comparativelyfew cars on the road last Sunday. 17. In addition to these steps the Mayors of the principal cities wereimmediately summoned to Wellington to consult with the Government authorities ;regarding E.P.S. measures. There is a wide-spread feeling that as regards suchmeasures, which are regarded as a matter for the local authorities, not nearlysufficient has been done hitherto in the way of preliminary preparation. Dangerof air attack has been regarded as so remote that it has been difficult to find asufficient number of public-spirited persons ready to give up their time to E.P.S.work or to persuade the general public to take seriously the necessity for suchthings as black-out precautions. As a result of ,last week&apos;s meeting, the workof preparation is now being put in hand in earnest; notices as to precautionarymeasures are being sent out to all householders; and black-out rehearsals arebeing held. Appeals for volunteers to dig shelter trenches have been made butwithout much success, judging by Wellington, where it was stated by the Mayorthat only six persons had reported on the first morning after his appeal.8. On the 18th December the Prime Minister held a press conferenceattended by the editors of the principal New Zealand newspapers. I understandthat he impressed upon them the seriousness of the situation and the impossibilityof promising protection to every part of New Zealand. Hitherto the line takenby the press has been generally unexceptionable.; 9. It is clear from conversations which I have had with various members ofthe Government and of the War Cabinet that they take a very grave view of the.present situation, and indeed one or two have shown symptoms of extremenervousness as to the dangers ahead. The signs of United States unpreparednessas shown at Pearl Harbour have undoubtedly come as a great shock to the fainthearts who had pinned their hopes on Unitedl States assistance in the event of aJapanese attack. The Prime Minister himself has adopted the robust sensibleattitude which was to be expected of him. He thinks that New Zealand is in fora rough time, but that it gives the people an opportunity of showing the stuff thatis in them : all that can be done is to organise the defences of the country as well
and as quickly as possible and for the rest to trust to Providence. Nowhere haveI heard any criticisms of the policy of sending so many able-bodied men out of thecountry or any suggestion for bringing back any of the New Zealand forces nowfighting overseas. On the other hand, I gather that there is a certain amount offeeling against denuding New Zealand further by the despatch of further rein-forcements, at any rate under existing circumstances.10. Since the beginning of the emergency the High Commissioner forCanada and the Consul-General for the United States have kept in close touchwith me. I have reason to think that the latter, in any reports which he mayhave sent to his Government as to the situation here, has emphasized both thedefenceless condition of the country (as to which the Consiil-General himselfappears to take a very serious view) and the fact that the Dominion Governmentare not to be blamed for that condition in so far as it is due to their right andproper action in sending hitherto all trained men overseas to the theatre of warwhere they were most required for the general defence of the Empire. &apos;11. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the United Kingdom HighCommissioners in Australia, Canada and the Union of South Africa.I have the honour to be,My Lord,Your Lordship&apos;s most obedient,humble servant,(Signed)        H. F. BATTERBEE,High Commissioner.The Right Honourable Viscount Cranborne,Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.
