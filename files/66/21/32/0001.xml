THIS DOCUMENT IS THE! PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAMIC/FulJgST^&apos;S GOVERNMENT^(TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND JkEY)!.       ...... - -SECRET.  - COPY NO. 2/W P 523ist January,. 1942. &apos;WAR CABINET.Policy regarding evacuation of civilian government officials .from, territory in imminent danger of occupation ;by the-enemy..;Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Burma and the.  . .     _,Secretary of State for the Colonies._  - - -In paragraph 5 of his telegram of 27th January (extract attached asAppendix I) the Governor of Burma raises the question, on which strongarguments can be adduced on b*th sides, whether the European officialsof a district in imminent danger ??f occupation by the enemy, should beevacuated with the troops or should be instructed to stay at their postsand allow themselves to be taken prisoner.... The. question so far as it concerns Burma has been closely&apos; discussedwith.officers how serving in the Burma Office who have previously servedin districts in Burma and also in India.     The draft telegram which isattached as Appendix II represents the views reached as a result of thisdiscussion.This draft telegram touches, at the end,, on the question which seemspossibly to be implied by the language used by Sir.R. Dorman-Smith, whether;the Governor equally should, the case arising, stand fast at. his post, inthe recognised seat of Government,&apos; which in the pase of Burma is Rangoon;In Colonial dependencies the line taken in the draft telegram toBurma with regard to District Officers will in many cases be applicable;but in view of the diversity of conditions a wide discretion will have tobe left to Governors. &apos; -The line taken in regard to the .Governor himself and the Government-,in the case of Burma, may not be applicable to the case of certain Coloniesin which, unlike Burma,  there&quot; is not geographical room for the Governor.-andhis Government to withdraw as the tide of invasion rolls, forward, to analternative seat of Government and carry on the administration of whatremains of his original charge.    (And Burma has, in the last resort, twoback doors - one very difficult, into India, and the other into China.)Some of the Colonies, e.-g. Singapore, do not afford similar scope forwithdrawal.     As a general direction, however, our view is that if ageographically small Colonial possession is in danger of being, whollyover-run by the enemy it is the duty of the Governor as the representativeof the King to remain with the defending forces until the last moment andeither evacuate with them (if evacuation is possible) or surrender with themif they-have to surrender.L..S.A.MOYNE.BURMA OFFICE.

5.     I saw ex D. C. Mergui today.      It would seem that a good scorchedearth policy was achieved.     He was disappointed at having to quit believ-ing that&apos;European officials should stay put and be taken prisoners.       Hedoubts whether we will ever be able to hold our heads very high thereagain.       This problem of what civilian officers should do in case ofinvasion is mighty difficult and there are most definitely two schoolsof thought.-   I would welcome your views.     Although I sanctioned Merguiwithdrawal my own view is that we all should stay put and, if needsbe, be captured.     I hate.idea of deserting the local population.    Onthe other hand it is argued and quite rightly that the Japanese willmerely arrest and intern any Europeans that remain and we will losevaluable officers.     It appears that both D.C. and D.S.P. Tavoy have beentaken by Japanese.     General Civil Service point of view seems to be thatthey should evacuate with the troops,      I can only hope that the problem .will not repeat not arise again and that Cur minds will soon be turned onto how to treat Thai Officials when we get into their country.INDIV.APPENDIX II.DRAFT TELEGRAM.Prom Secretary of State to Governor of Burma.IMMEDIATE.Personal.     Your telegram unnumbered 27th January para.  5.      This is a .very difficult matter on which to give directions and has been verycarefully considered in the light of such guidance as can be derived fromevents in Malaya.2.     We feel that all technical officers such as P.W.D. and otherengineers, Forest officers and staff, whether European or Burman, should bewithdrawn with troops, except, possibly in the case of Burman officers thosewho are local residents and prefer to remain.      This is in general conformitywith scorched earth policy which directs that skilled operatives should bewithdrawn as well as plant destroyed.3* Nucleus hospital staffs up to sub-Assistant Surgeons should beinstructed to stand fast but in view of shortage I.M.S. officers whetherEuropean or Burman, permanent or temporary, should be withdrawn..A.     The crucial case is in respect of administrative staff,  viz.executive, police,  judicial.&apos;     Unless it should prove that Fishwick andMacColl have been shot by the.Japanese otherwise than for offering forcibleresistance to invaders,, (in which case it would be too much to require otherofficers to stay and face similar fate,) our considered view is that Europeanor Burma Civil Service, and European Police Officers should be instructed tostand fast.     Our reasons for this view are (1) that their decision to staywould show that we regard Japanese occupation as temporary only,  (2) that ifnative population were to regard British.officers as deserters of them inface of the enemy it would not be easy to live down the reproach when wereoccupy the places and (3) that the Japanese would make great play withwhat they would represent as desertion of the Burman by his alien ruler.Extract from telegram from Governor of Burma to Secretary ofState for Burma, dated 27th January, 19A2 (Un-numbered)

We doubt whether European officers who stay, would be able..to perform anyuseful function, since the strong probability&apos; is that the Japanese Would takethem prisoners and remove them from their charges.     Their staying would belittle more than a gesture, the omission to make which might however causeirremediable harm both at once and in the future.     Officers should beinstructed not repeat not to carry arms when Japanese enter into occupationand on-no account to offer forcible resistance to enemy forces..- 5.     Burman officers of the two Services mentioned in paragraph 1+should be invited by their European superiors to volunteer to stay.6.     Judicial officers are not, we believe,, in the same sort ofpaternal relationship to the.people of the locality as are the;.administrativeofficers and our view is that as&apos; it is most unlikely that they would be ableto perform ahy useful function in Japanese occupation they, Burman as wellas European, should be withdrawn with the troops.      In general instructions .should be careful to avoid affording any ground for enemy to assert that  .Burman officers are,being left to fend for themselves- and Europeanswithdrawn to safety and,  except in regard.to technical officers particularlyvaluable eslewhere, avoidance of any&apos;suggestion of racial discriminationshould be observed even to extent of leaving more European officers thanyou might consider necessary.7&apos;.     The views expressed in paragraph 4 apply only to the officersin direct official contact with&apos;the population of the immediate localitywhose occupation is imminent.     They do not apply for example to theCommissioner of Tenasserim, whose headquarters are at Moulmein, but -who,even after the occupation of Moulmein, will still, have the- greater part ofhis charge to administer, nor,  of pourse, should the general tenor of thisdecision be taken to apply to the question- whether or not Governmentshould stay in Rangoon if the occupation of Rangoon became imminent.It is clear that the Government of the country should withdraw ascircumstances require and keep itself in being,in unoccupied territory.
