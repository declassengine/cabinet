(42) 14 Conclusions), the War Office was invited to circulate to theCabinet the recent reports from Russia which had been received from GeneralMason MacFarlane. A digest of these reports is appended.The War Office,5th February, 1942.1. General Situation. General MacFartane visited the 5th Army and82 Infantry Division from 26th January to 28th January. He reported on hisvisit as follows:   .5th Army was on a front of about 37 miles astride Moscow-Smolensk roadon a line running north and south about 10 km. east of Gzhatsk*. Six divisionswere up and apparently four in reserve. 82 Division, astride Moscow-Smolenskroad, held a front of 5 km. (3 miles).Considerable resistance was met along the entire Army front butespecially in the centre where the Germans have defences in considerable depthin front of Gzhatsk which they clearly intend to hold. The army was attackingall along the line on 27th and 28th January, but in the centre was only makingslow progress. General MacFarlane gained the impression that it was intendedto keep up heavy pressure on this sector while the right of the army conformedto a southward movement by the next army on the right.2. Climatic Conditions and Communications. During the visit thetemperature was nearly -40 degrees F. and the depth of snow was, in opencountry, over 2 ft. 6 ins. and in forests from 3 to 5 ft. Roads require constantclearing of snow. Due to the deep snow infantry can operate off the roads andtracks only with difficulty. Medium and heavy tanks can get across countrybut slowly and with difficulty. Cavalry and artillery are confined to theproximity of roads and tracks.Tanks and snow. No snow will stop a medium tank. But deep snow slowsit up greatly and a drift may have to be charged several times. Therefore,anti-tank weapons get very good targets if sited to cover deep snow. Theonly effect that snow has upon the standard type of anti-tank obstacle is tomake them more difficult.In the country in which the Russians are now operating all the bridges,large and small, have been destroyed and many of the towns and villages areliterally level with the ground.   The thickness of ice on rivers (Dnieper and* 105 miles west of Moscow.
Moskva) is sufficient to carry light tanks and field artillery. It is not, however,necessary to build a bridge to get even the K. V tank (45 tons) across. It isonly necessary to lay a thick wooden roadway so as to distribute the weight.East of Vyazma the Germans have destroyed the railway very completely.(Note. The Russians removed most of the rails themselves during their retreat;but they got an engine through to Mozhaisk on 27th January, 1942).3. German Defensive Tactics. Fighting on 5th Army front was mostly onroads and tracks. German tactics are to hold all towns and villages as long aspossible and, when they retire, to burn them completely, which is an easymatter, as they are all of wood. Where villages are far apart they constructsmall defended localities on roads or tracks to link up.There is only one German Panzer Division in action against the Russian5th Army. The unarmoured portion of this Division holds a sector of the frontwhile the Tank Regiment is distributed in small groups over the front of fiveDivisions.The German tanks are all medium Pz. 3 and Pz. 4 and they work in smallgroups of from three to five tanks and stick almost entirely to roads or tracks.The Germans are using anti-tank and anti-personnel mines in very largenumbers in retirement. The Russians, who possess an excellent mine detectorcapable of locating mines under snow, used to clear these mine fields veryefficiently and quickly: but they are now very worried because the Germanshave produced mines made of wood, both anti-tank and anti-personnel, and theRussian detector does not react to this. German defence is generally in con-siderable depth and retirement by leapfrogging. Defence consists mostly ofsmall works for one machine-gun or anti-tank gun, which are generally sitedin groups of from four to eight, with all round field of fire.The normal German reaction to any threat is intense mortar fire almostentirely from the 3-2-in. mortar. The 2-in. mortar is little used. There seemsno lack of mortar ammunition. In the Mozhaisk and Gzhatsk areas the Germanshave done much heavy wiring in the forests. These belts of wire have been aconsiderable obstacle, but have not always been adequately covered by fire.In both these areas the German defences extend for some six miles in advanceof their main line of resistance, but they are disconnected and patchy untilclose to this line. At Mozhaisk one German division was on a front or not more&quot;than 5,000 metres (3 miles) and there is ample evidence that the Germans hadlittle intention of leaving this line until forced to.In retirement the Germans have small groups of tanks and anti-tank gunson all roads and tracks leading into their positions. Where they decide tomake a stand these operate level with F.D.Ls. When time permits they try toclear one lateral road or track behind their F.D.Ls. During General Mac-Farlane&apos;s visit to the 82 Division the Germans had six medium tanks patrollingin the F.D.L. area on the Moscow-Minsk road plus a close support gun, plustwo anti-tank guns.The Russians are very impressed by the intensity of German anti-aircraftfire from the ground in mobile operations, particularly with the volume andcontrol of S.A.A. fire.4. Russian Offensive Tactics. Russian tactics consist mostly of infiltrationof Infantry for which purpose ski troops are also used. These work round&quot;the German defended localities and pin their garrisons down while Infantryare brought up to finish the job. The Russians try to effect surprise wheneverpossible, and these ski parties are rarely accompanied by tanks.The general tactical idea appeared to be to push Infantry forward throughgaps between defended enemy localities by keeping these localities under firefrom all available supporting weapons. It must be remembered that thisattack, though pressing on as hard as possible, was primarily designed to keepthe enemy pinned down while &quot;the big stuff was coming down behind theenemy from the north&quot;. The Germans having lost most of their pre-wartrained night fighting personnel, are very loath to fight at night, while theRussians are doing a lot of their best work at night.5. Artillery Lay-out-Along the Minsk-Mozhaisk main road reinforceddivisional artillery was deployed in depth plus a liberal supply of anti-tankweapons in case the enemy tried to rush up the road; the whole presenteda marvellous air or artillery target. In three cases batteries were in actionactually on the side of the road firing in column of route.
6. Air -German air activity on this sector is almost negligible and onlyvery spasmodic counter battery shelling was seen. . J;J jAs against this the Russian Air Force were showing considerable activity.Most of their effort has been devoted to bombing the congested roads of retire-ment, especially the big main road, and there is much evidence of the effective-ness of their attack in the shape of destroyed tanks and vehicles and deadhorses. The air units supporting the army work directly under the ordersof the army staff., The Russians stated that a request for air support from theCommand of an Infantry Regiment was normally answered by bombs on theground within about one hour provided the aircraft were available. GeneralMacFarlane was informed that the Russians are now attacking German tankssuccessfully with the Rocket Bomb flying almost at ground level and shootingthe bomb nearly horizontally.7. Russian Defensive Tactics. Defences. A start is generally made bybuilding a snow parapet eight feet thick. Water is then poured on this parapetand freezes. The result is bullet proof. Where available logs are used tostrengthen such parapets. Digging in sandy soil is nearly always possible withpicks and crowbars. In other soil, explosive charges are sunk, to depth of fivefeet to loosen the ground.Anti-tank mines. Can be laid anywhere and at any depth in snow withoutefficiency being affected.Anti-tank ditches.--The Russians rely largely on ditches on wooden pilesof at least six inches diameter set at 45 degrees and on crows feet of very heavyangle iron.8. Protection against the weather.(a) Personnel. Clothes. No blankets are carried. Clothing is consideredample, and when off duty troops are always packed in stove heated dug-outs.Two sets of good underclothing are often worn, followed by a skirt and pull-over with padded trousers and coat, over which goes a greatcoat or shortsheepskin coat. The anti-gas cape serves also as a ground sheet and water-proof. Headgear consists of a fur cap and also a Balaclava type helmet. Thetin hat is not worn except under fire, when it is put on over the Balaclava.Two pairs of gloves are provided. All leather boots were returned to storesearly in November and Valenki issued instead. These are thick, rolled-felt,knee high loose boots. Under the Valenki the man does not wear socks buta piece of cloth wrapped around his feet and ankles.Shelter. As the Germans burn the villages at the last moment beforeclearing out, the ground under each house has been well thawed when theRussians arrive. They immediately dig down five or six feet, and by coveringthe excavation with logs, tarpaulin or brushwood, obtain a dug-out which theyheat with a stove, which is often converted from an oil drum. The 82 Divisionhad taken up its headquarters in a burnt village in this manner.If no village is, available the Russians go into the forest where theyimprovise shelters out of snow, tarpaulins and brushwood. These shelters areusually about 12 or 15 by 8 feet and are always heated with a stove.Special Precautions. At very low temperatures sentries are relieved everyhour and wounded must be gathered quickly to prevent frost-bite; they arebrought in by regimental stretcher bearers on low sledges built on to skis. Inaction Russian troops will carry on indefinitely as long as they are kept moving,however low the temperature. The limiting factor of their endurance is notcold but lack of sleep. The Russians claim to be getting very few cases of frost-bite and consider all such cases due to carelessness or bad management. Menare issued with vaseline or goose fat at the discretion of commanders in verycold or windy weather.(&amp;) M.T. and Equipment. Small arms which have become gummed up arewiped entirely dry and are then lubricated with kerosene and fired prior tolubrication with oil.Motor vehicles gum up very quickly in low temperatures and heaters areprovided for all vehicles on a varying scale.Lubricating oil for weapons is of the thin arctic type and buffers are filledwith special liquid. Water-cooled machine-gun jackets are filled with glycerine.All lubricants and grease are proof down to at least -50 degrees C.(10030)
, g. Camouflage in snow-PersonneL-^Wbtite suits and hoods are very good.Failing these a roll in the snow produces very good camouflage, especiallyagainst forest background.Defences.-Defences against air and ground observation.-It is practicallyimpossible to conceal from the air work in progress. Snow makes groundobservation very difficult, but smoke, which is unavoidable must disclosepositions to both ground and air.10. Commissariat. Feeding of Russian troops in action. In action inwinter the Russians endeavour to provide a good hot meal about dawn andanother after nightfall. The food is cooked in the &quot; waggon lines &quot; and is sentup in containers. For use during the day the man in action gets a haversackration mainly bread.ii. Miscellaneous  Information-German. The   enormous   quantity   ofmotor-cycles used by the Germans during their advance are no longer inevidence. On the other hand Germans are making great use of push bicycles.-   German light tanks have entirely disappeared from the Russian army front.German transport parked in Rusa had had a very bad hammering fromthe Russian Air Force.  A proper shambles.In extreme cold parties of German soldiers often allow themselves to berounded up in houses rather than risk leaving the warmth.12. Interview with prisoners. General MacFarlane interrogated sixGerman prisoners severally. These were a poor lot. Their clothing was utterlyinadequate, none having any special winter clothing. All had copies of Russianpropaganda pamphlets and thought that this was general throughout the army.Promise of good treatment of prisoners had got this propaganda a fine distribu-tion. All were very out of touch with events. They were tired of the war andstated that their families felt the same. All stated that there was no lack offood or ammunition during the retreat though both had occasionally beenshort during the advance. The Second in Command of Russian 5th Army saidthat letters found on German dead and prisoners showed a very bad spirit onthe German home front (iV..B.-There was nothing to show whether thesesix prisoners were really representative of the German Army as a whole.)13. Partisans. General MacFarlane was informed by the Commander of82 Infantry Division that he was in closest contact with the partisans operatingbehind the enemy lines in his sector; they had been doing good work on themain road between Gzhatsk and Vyazma.General MacFarlane later saw a party of 40 &quot;partisans at divisional head-quarters. They were well and warmly dressed in civilian clothes and armedwith rifles and a few tommy guns. There was a fair sprinkling of hardbitten,middle-aged men among them and also four girls. The party, which made adeep impression on General MacFarlane, received orders to get through theGerman lines that night and to blow up a railway bridge west of Vyazma.14. General MacFarlane&apos;s general Impressions. Seven months of con-tinuous hard fighting, which are worth more than seven years peace timesoldiering, have made veterans of the Russian officers and troops.Although the Russians started the war with relatively untrained and inex-perienced commanders and staffs, these were not, as was popularly supposed-uneducated and unintelligent. The Russians had clearly learnt a good dealmore about winter fighting in the war with Finland than was generally realised.General MacFarlane was greatly impressed with the personalities of thecommanders he met; in particular the Army Commander, his Deputy and theDivisional Commander were outstanding; strong characters and genuine fightingsoldiers, they were full of commonsense and knew a lot about practical lighting.He was also much impressed with the Army Commissars; sound andintelligent men whose relations with the Commanders were clearly of the best.They are, in effect, the Chaplains of the Red Army with a political creed inplace of religion.--------------- -......---------..........-......----------------&apos;---General MacFarlane saw no signs of bragging or even of enthusiasm buta quiet and confident &quot; getting on &quot; with the job. Although there is no tendency. to underestimate the German Army, there is a healthy confidence that the tidehas turned and that the Red Army has at present the upper hand.  GeneralMacFarlane considers that, under the present severe climatic conditions, the Red^ Army is definitely superior to the Germans.
2,2,8(b41/66)   100   2/42   w.o.p.   10030It is realised by the Red Army High Command that the Germans may-stage a formidable come-back but probably not until after the thaw; but itis not intended to give the Germans the respite they would welcome.There is a very general impression that the German soldier of to-day is verydifferent in his fighting capacity from the man of the early days of the campaign.This is particularly noticeable in night fighting ; formerly the Germans, includingarmoured units, were very good at night, but they now avoid action in the dark.The Red Army&apos;s quiet confidence is combined with dull resentment againstthe Germans, a feeling which is aggravated by the destruction in the villageswhich they are now re-occupying.The Red Army is well-clothed, adequately fed and, as far as can be judged,adequately equipped, in spite of the huge losses. Transport is &quot; like nothing onearth &quot; and consists of everything from sledges with stocky little ponies to lorriesof every &quot; vintage &quot;.Man-power means nothing to the Russians, a fact which must be verydepressing to the Germans. The roads, for instance, are cleared of snow not bymechanical means but by herds of men, who impede the traffic, going from onejob to another; but communications appear to be adequate. Co-operationbetween arms seems good and procedure is straightforward commonsense, withno frills other than in ski work. Ocular demonstration convinced GeneralMacFarlane that the Russians had local air superiority.Strategically, there is always the danger that the Red Army may outrun itstransportation in devastated country, but its leaders appear to have no intentionof losing contact with the enemy and thus enable him to disengage and regrouphis troops.Russian Staff work and Administration is typical of Russia; on the lowerlevel in the field it is relatively efficient, but higher up grows progressively worse.The desired result is usually achieved in the end, but there is lack of co-ordinationand much muddle and avoidable delay owing to lack of organization ; and yet, inspite of all this, when something urgent has to be done, a miracle occurs,, eventhough in its performance various other items are thrown out of gear.General MacFarlane&apos;s impressions were formed after a period of long restraintand few opportunities of seeing the Red Army at work; his knowledge of thebackground is, therefore, limited, but his impressions are vivid and he feels thatwhat he saw at Gzhatsk is happening on the whole front.The Red Army was in a bad way in autumn; but it went on fighting andnow its tail is up.
