mm5th February, .19^2. -.    :W A.R   &apos; G :A B I N E T;. ; CONSIDERATION- UNDER LEASE-LEND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,In the light of the messages which have been receivedfrom Washington during the last twenty-four hours, I amnow more than ever, doubtful whether the United States .Government will accept the proposal which, I suggested inW.P* (42) 62 of Vth February, Lord Halifax should beinstructed to put to them.I think that my colleagues should see the draft whichI had available for circulation at the meeting of the WarCabinet on February 2nd of the Notes which I had it in mindto suggest as constituting the agreed interpretation ofArticle VII.    This draft, which is based on the wording,of the State Departments telegrams communicated to us bythe United States Ambassador early in December, goesfurther to meet the American point of view*    With possiblya few minor amendments it would, I hope, stand a fair chanceof acceptance.1a    United States Note to His Majesty1s Ambassador.Your Excellency,I have the honour to refer to Article VII of the Agreementconcluded this day between the Government of the UnitedStates and the Government of the United Kingdom of GreatBritain and Northern Ireland and to give. Your Excellency onbehalf of the Government :of the United States the followingexplanation of the import of that Article. &apos;A.E.FOREIGN OFFICE.5th February, T912.Draft of proposed Exchange of Notes.
2..,,, ,The terms-of Article VII are of a general natureand are intended to be of mutual benefit to, both Governments,The Article defines basically the economic objectives ofthe two G-overnments and provides for the opening of.conversations in detail to reach agreement concerning waysand means of arriving at these objectives,   . In essenceArticle VII charts a broad course and commits, the two     .....Governments to co-operate in making headway along thatcourse;   the means and stages by which the agreement  -proposed will be implemented will be based upon governingeconomic conditions..3.    The purpose of the Article is set out in the firstsentence and. is to find termswhich will not.burden ;commerce between the two nations, but will rather promotemutually advantageous, economic relations between them&apos;andbetween, other -nations.     The remainder:of the Article&apos;   vcontains an assurance that the.final settlement shallbe arrived&apos;at-by-.negotiation and that it-shall be of sucha character that -as a forward step towards worldwidereconstruction other nations will be able to join in it..Express recognition is given in the Article to the factthat the.liberalisation of commercial policy is primarilydependent, upon agreed action by all:the participants andincreased economic activitys both- national-andinternational,- in- employment,-., product ion and the consumptionand exchange of goods6     It is against this backgroundand in conjunction with it that- there are added theobjectives of eliminating, by agreement.and. if necessaryby gradual stages, discriminatory treatment, reducingtariffs and achieving the other objectives of the AtlanticCharterei,.,,    No attempt is made in the Article to lay downimmediately execut$&amp;y obligations or to impose anyformula by which the solution of all problems shall bereached.    The United States Government fully realise thatthe problems facing each of the two Governments and otherparticipating Governments will be different;   and thata solution can only be found, if the Governments concernedtake all proper.,account of the prevailing economic conditionsin their joint effort to&quot;find&apos; &quot;by agreement the best meansof making the;common goal:attainablee . r- ....5s     In drafting the Article the United StatesGovernment have taken into account the difficulty of the manyproblems which will confront each of the two.. Governmentsand no attempt is made to impose upon either any unilateral .commitment or any obligation which is not also imposedupon the other.    In Article VII it is also, recognisedthat&apos; the final settlement shall not be limited to questionsof commercial policy only, but,shall embrace all measuresfor promoting increased employment, production, consumptionand exchange of goods.
