Attention is drawn to the following points of special interest: Officers.(i) The satisfactory outlook for Officers.   The position is assured in thisrespect for 1942 and 1943 provided that no large additions are madeto the requirements of the Services.(ii) The success of the Universities&apos; Training Scheme in both the numberand quality of the output of trained personnel. This is due largelyto the success of the State Bursaries Scheme.Radio and Wireless Mechanics.(iii) The steady reduction in the deficit of Radio and Wireless Mechanics,and the good prospect of its disappearance not later than September1942, unless there is a large increase in the demands of the Services.(iv) The success of the Board of Educations plan for using TechnicalColleges for ab initio training of Service personnel. 83 Colleges arebeing used, mostly on double shifts. 14,000 men have been passed tothe Services or Industry, and over 12,000 (including a few women)are under training.Personnel from Overseas.(v) Canada has trained 2,500 men in Universities.    By the end of 1942524 had arrived in this country. It has been arranged that one-fifthof the number arriving from this source, or an equivalent number ofRadio Mechanics of United Kingdom origin, should be handed to theArmy by the R.A.F.(vi) Other Dominions required the yield of their training schemes nearerhome.(vii) The failure of the scheme for a Civilian Training Corps recruited inthe United States to produce, either in quantity or quality, thepersonnel we were led to expect. This failure has resulted in somedelay in our plans, but compensation has been obtained by increasedtraining facilities at home.[23366] B
(viii) The comparative success of Dr. Conanfs scheme for sending trainedscientists, enlisted as Officers of&quot; the United States Army, as;, &quot; Observers.&quot;   As a stop-gap arrangement the 250 Officer Observershave been useful,(ix) The invaluable assistance received from- n!The Board of Education in promoting and developing/  M Training Schemes in Technical Colleges and Universities.The Treasury for prompt financial support.The Ministry of Aircraft Production in the equipment ofTechnical Schools,The Ministry of Labour and National Service in manymatters. &quot;The Radio Manufacturers&apos; Association and its representa-tive, Mr. Edward Rosen.Sir Fra,nklin Sibly, Chairman, and the members of theCommittee of: Vice-Chancellors of the Universities of the BritishEmpire.Mr. Clement Jones and the members and Joint Secretaries ofhis Joint Sub-Committee in co-ordinating the above activities.i:) HANKEY.Paymaster-General&apos;s Office, iPrivy Council Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1.        &apos; &apos;
WIRELESS PERSONNEL JOINT SUB-COMMITTE&amp;! (Radio Industry and Services:)Progress Report.To the Paymaster-General,ON the first anniversary of our appointment we present a further ProgressReport.    , - ^ &apos;2. We realise that you keep in such close touch with our work that anydetailed account of what we have done may perhaps seem redundant. You may,however, wish to circulate to Ministers and Departments concerned a record ofthe Committee&apos;s activities during the past few months, and we have thereforeprepared this Report with that object in view.3. The problems with which we have been confronted are similar in kindto those which you described in your Progress Report on Skilled Radio Personnelof the 7th August last (N.A.D. (41) 24), though in certain particulars,, -Owing tomeasures taken subsequently, they are less acute to-day than they were then.4. Our task of making provision for the finding and training of wirelesspersonnel may be divided, as previously, into two classes: (a) The officer grade; and;   :.       (b) The radio and wireless mechanic grade.,;,     &apos; Officers. -; &apos;5. The officer position, thanks to the State BursariesScheme,; is reasonablyassured for the next twelve months, and, provided the Bursaries Scheme isextended into 1942, there should be no further anxiety.6. Dr. Snow has recently made a Report on the Scheme for the Trainingof Radio Officers, of which the following are the main points :  ,(a) As a result of the first year&apos;s work just under 800 men and women havebeen trained as radio officers.   These have been placed as follows : R.N.    ............      ...      ...      ... 40: Army...............      .....; 210R.A.F. ...............    ..... 220W.A.A.F.      ...    v..,               ...      ... 30Government Research Laboratories...      ... 160i         Industry        ...      ............ 80iTeaching, ,    ...      ...               ...      ... 20;.-:t.-,. : : .,A,i m$ ^        &apos;: g      -       : ; : ^ \ &apos; 760.- :gThe wastage has been negligible.(&amp;) In the autumn of 1941 every university institution in Great Britain wasi    .....    visited and all radio trainees personally interviewed by Dri Snow.v \c) The total number of these potential radio officers, including radio bursarslikely to become available for service in 1942 and 1943,is approximately&apos; 2,500. -     A(d) There are at present some 1,000 radio bursars in training.   They are,on the average, slightly above the normal standard of universityentrants, both in ability and personal quality.(e) In 1940 there was effectively only one school of fundamental radioteaching in the country and a yearly output of potential radio officersof about 50. In December; 1941,, every university institution inGreat Britain was giving this teaching. The output has risen to800 in 1941; will:be 1,200 in 1942 and 1,300 in 1943. So long as theState Bursary Scheme is maintained,&apos; a yearly output of thesedimensions can be assured.(/) All these men and women are receiving a thorough scientific education.The course in electronics has been carefully grafted into the normalcourse in natural science. So we are providing over 1,000 young menand women each year who can, if the emergency arises, be rapidlytrained for any kind of scientific duty.[23366] b 2
(g) Some difficulty has arisen in the placing of officer trainees during 1941--particularly in the Government Research Departments,&apos;owing to thevarying status and rates of pay given in these Departments to menof identical qualifications.(h) In some cases bursaries were; refused under the mistaken apprehensionthat the acceptance of a bursary imposed additional liability for state.       :    service. . ,     ;. -     - .   -       &apos; -&quot;7. The Committee, after considering the Report in consultation withDr. Snow ano); - experts from the Ministries concerned, has made certainrecommendations, including the following :-(1) The utilisation of radio bursars who wish to volunteer for service at theend of their first academic year (1942) is to be subject to individualinvestigation, every case being decided upon its merits, so as to ensure- that any such men put into service shall have had training sufficientto enable them to perform a useful radio function in the Service oftheir choice.(2) The difficulties likely to arise from the varying status and rates of paygiven to men of identical qualifications in the Research Establishmentsof the different Supply Ministries are considered to be of such gravitythat it has been decided to record the Committee&apos;s view that, unlessthis matter is speedily and suitably adjusted; it will be foundimpossible to provide for the Research Establishments the skilledpersonnel they need.(3) In order to make it clear that a bursar is no more and no less at thedisposal of the State than anyone else of military age, and for thesake of justice, no man should be permitted to stay at a Universityfor more than two years unless there are exceptional reasons why heshould remain.8. Assuming that the decisions recorded above are implemented, the radioofficer trainees to be brought into Service in 1942 will be approximately asfollows :-Those now in second or higher years who will not in anycase continue at the University beyond 1942     ...      700State bursars volunteering for service at the end of theirfirst year............      ...      ...      ...      340Non-bursars brought into service ...      ...      ..,.   -   ...      2001,240Approximately 1,300 will then be available in 1943.9. The estimated requirements of the Services, Research Establishmentsand Industry for radio officers in 1942 are : ;.. - Royal Navy ...      ....     ... 100Army ...      .:......... 430 (excluding 250 from America)R.A.F. ...      ...      ... 200Research Establishments -Admiralty       ...      ... 125M.A.P.........      ... 210Air Ministry   ...      ... 180M.O.S.   ...      .:.      ....       40 ;1      Industry      ...      ......        80&quot; . 1,365&apos; .10. Among the men &quot;combed out&quot; of the Services with previous radioexperience, a large number have been found who are suitable for training asofficers. Arrangements have therefore been made by Dr. Snow at the Committee&apos;srequest for &quot;Refresher Courses&quot; fpr the training of these men. The courseswill be held at Nottingham University and at University College, Leicester.Suitable accommodation, laboratories and staff are available for the trainingof 30/40 men at one time. The expenses other than equipment will be borne bythe Ministry of Labour.
Radio Mechanics.Training of radio mechanics in the Technical Colleges.11. When we were appointed a year ago the demands of the Services andIndustry, for wireless personnel amounted to a total of 5,800 men. v Provisionalarrangements were made by the Board of Education for their training in theTechnical Colleges and a grant of  20,000 was made by the Treasury foressential equipment. In April there were actually in training 2,300 men in 50colleges. In July greatly increased Service demands were presented and theBoard of Education reported that 13,530 places were available in 61 Colleges.1 By the end of September, after more Colleges had been allocated.for the purpose,there were actually in training 10,220 in 77 Colleges.12. The latest figures show 83 Colleges oeing used, with an ultimatecapacity of 16,081. The actual number of trainees at present is 12,401. Some14,000 have already been passed on to the Services and Industry. Thus the totalstrength of the wireless personnel, for the finding and training of whom we havemade provision during the year just ended, is over 26,000 men.13. The men put into training under this scheme have been found almostentirely from within the Services themselves. Continuous &quot; combing&quot; for menwith previous radio knowledge has been carried out in the Services; and thishas recently been supplemented to find men with a general education which wouldenable them to assimilate wireless training; , In the Army some 13,000 men ofthis type have been found;, and in the R.A.F. the policy of transferring suitablemen employed in sedentary duties to wireless training and replacing them byWA.A.E.S. is being pursued with successful results. To a small extent, also,experiments are being carried out in all three Services in the training and use ofwomen as wireless mechanics.14. The extent to which the work of the Committee has been successful inproviding skilled wireless personnel to meet the requirements of the FightingServices is indicated below : 	31st March, 1942.			30th June, 1942.

The scheme for training young people to provide a continuous supplyof skilled wireless personnel both for the Services and for Industry, to whichreference was made in the Interim Report of the 22nd April, has been put intooperation.16.   Some 300 young people have passed successfully through the first four,months&apos; course, and have been suitably placed in the industry. Arrangements have, been made for the training of another 250 during the early part of 1942.Wireless Personnel from Overseas. n17: During the past summer radio training has been proceeding at most ofthe Canadian Universities, and some 2,500 men have passed through these courses.Of these, 450 failed; some 800 radio mechanics were to be shipped to Englandin October, the remainder being held for advanced training in Canada; 524 havearrived to date.  The men coming to this country did so as R.A.F. recruits.  It
has been arranged that one-fifth of the number arriving from this source shallbe allocated to the Army, and, in order&quot; to overcome any difficulties which mightarise through enforced transference of Canadians recruited to the R.A.F., theR.A.F. have agreed to attach to the Army the equivalent number of radiomechanics of United Kingdom origin.18. Recently there has been talk about the slowing down and the closing-down of Civilian Technical Corps, but the fact is that the C.T.C. has never reallymoved or 6pened. Its output of wireless personnel has been negligible, and it hasgiven nO real help towards meeting the demand for radio mechanics. Throughout1941, first in one guise as &quot; British,&quot; and later in another as &quot; American,&quot; theC.T.C. has failed to attract the large numbers that were originally expected, inspite of the energy and efforts of those working for it, both British and Americanon both sides of the Atlantic.19. While our Committee has never counted on this source of supply toyield big results, we have kept in constant touch with the organisation. On the7th October Mr. Donald Gill, Commandant of the C.T.C. at Bournemouth,attended a meeting to outline the situation of the Corps. He reported that theCorps consisted of all kinds of technical craftsmen, wiremen, welders, &amp;c, aswell as wireless mechanics. The total strength of the Corps at that time in thiscountry amounted to only 74 men, of whom 40 were classified as radio mechanics,but more were already on the way, and it was expected that the total wouldpass 1,000.20. On the 2nd December we reviewed the position again. When theC.T.C. was first conceived, nearly a year ago, it was thought it might be a meansof securing rapidly from America a considerable supply of technicians alreadytrained. Experience to date, however, showed that the men obtained throughthe C.T.C. were few in number, poor in quality, needed ab initio training onarrival here, and their employment in a suitable capacity was often a matter ofconsiderable difficulty. The Committee questioned Whether there was really aneed for these men at the present time, and whether it was wise to expendtraining facilities on them when they might, at any moment, be recalled to theU.S.A. It was therefore decided that the representatives of the Services, inconjunction with the Ministry of Labour, should examine whether the C.T.C.could assist in any way in meeting our requirements for skilled wirelesspersonnel.21. Five days later America entered the war and from then on the C.T.C.,except for the small number of men already at Bournemouth, has gradually fadedout of the picture.22. Approximately 250 men from the U.S.A. are now performing varioustypes of radio officer duty under the title of &quot;observers,&quot; through a schemesponsored by Dr. Conant, of Havard University....... . Equipment.23. Parallel with the problem of training personnel is the provision of theequipment essential for that training. This equipment is the same in kind asthat urgently required by the Services for operational purposes. Training needswere not adequately realised when orders were placed by the Supply Ministriesfor this equipment. Consequently, the securing of the bare minimum for efficienttraining has been a matter of considerable difficulty.24. When the comparatively modest demands for skilled wireless personnelwere made a year ago, it was considered  20.000 would be adequate to purchasethe equipment required for training in the Technical Colleges, and a Treasurygrant of that amount was authorised on the 10th February.25. The expanded personnel requirements of the Services necessitated notonly the supply of a great deal more equipment to the Technical Colleges tomeet the needs of the much larger classes, but also the use of many Colleges notso well equipped as those originally selected. In consequence, further financialgrants were needed,, and in all a sum of  70,000 has been obtained for therequirements of the Technical Colleges and  20,000 for the Universities.
26. The assessment of equipment needs, ordering, progressing and deliveryto the Technical Colleges and Universities has developed into a work ofconsiderable magnitude. The original arrangement whereby the RadioManufacturers&apos; Association acts as the medium for the placing of orders, &amp;c,has worked well and is continuing. To secure efficiency and proper co-ordination,it has been thought wise to pool the financial grants and to regard the equipmentpurchased as a pool from which distribution can be made to the Technical Collegesand Universities according to the needs of each.27. For this purpose it has been found necessary to provide a small staffof progress officers, clerks and storekeepers, &amp;c, working under CaptainH. G. Sturgeon, in collaboration with Mr. Browne one of the Committee&apos;s JointSecretaries, and Secretary of the Radio Manufacturers&apos; Association andMr. Crawcour, Ministry of Aircraft Production.28. Whilst much equipment still remains to be delivered, a large proportionhas already been obtained and distributed to the 83 Technical Colleges. Thedelivery of the balance with all possible speed is assured. The immediaterequirements of the Universities (some 20 in number) will, it is confidentlyexpected, be met by the opening of the Lent Term.29. The Committee is greatly indebted to Sir Frank Smith and AirCommodore Leedham for their active collaboration in the work of securingequipment for training purposes. Without their help the position wouldundoubtedly be less satisfactory than it is.30. To assist the equipment problem four appeals have been issued, one tothe wireless amateurs, through the Wireless Telegraphy Board, and. three to theRadio Trade, through the Radio Manufacturers&apos; Association. As a result, agood deal of most useful equipment has been secured.31. Also, a quantity of instruments, including cathode ray oscilloscopes,have been ordered on Lease-Lend from the U.S.A. Delivery has been slow, but150 oscilloscopes have been received from this source to date. Unfortunately,one consignment of 50 instruments was lost in shipment.Conclusion.32. At the close of a review of this kind it is well to look forward and findout, if possible, what the future holds. The officer position is now reasonablyassured and the prospects of obtaining the other ranks and ratings are certainlybetter than they were last summer. At that time we had been notified of thevast increase in the Service requirements, but we had not succeeded in closingthe gap, even approximately, between supply and demand. No matter how farwe might look ahead, there was a serious prospective shortage of radio mechanicsin all three Services.   To-day, however, owing (a) to tihe provision of additional personnel by further combing out of theServices, and(b) to the measures since taken for training in an increased number ofTechnical Colleges,we can see our way to wiping out the deficit that now exists and balancing theaccount by next September, provided that no further additions are made to theService requirements.CLEMENT JONES, Chairman.January 16, 1942.
