THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1942SECRET. Copy NoCW.P, (42) 30.January 21, 1942.WAR CABINET.CO-OPERATION WITH THE DOMINION GOVERNMENTS...   - ;; [Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.    )THE purpose of this memorandum is to set out certain concrete suggestionsfor improving the machinery of co-operation with the oversea DominionGovernments in connection with the direction of the war.2, Following upon correspondence with the Prime Minister at Washingtonlast week, of which the War Cabinet are aware (Cabinet 5 (42), Conclusion 2),the Prime Minister has now telegraphed to the Prime Ministers of Australia,and New Zealand proposing the establishment of a Far Eastern War Councilin London on which the two Dominions and also the Dutch Government will berepresented by representatives of Cabinet status under the chairmanship of theePrime Minister himself. ;    \ ,3. The establishment of this Council goes a considerable way Jo meet; jthjfesubstantial Australian; demands for a greater share in the control of the direCticjlof the war.   But it fails to meet those demands in two different ways... v   o zi4. In the first place, it has been represented, more especially by Sir Eari^Page on behalf of Australia, that consultation at the Ministerial level isinadequate unless there, is also an opportunity given to a Dominion Governmentto receive information&apos;and make its views known at an earlier stage while plansare still in process of formulation. The argument is that too often, by the timethe matter reaches the Ministerial level, the position is crystallised and proposalsare made to the Dominions on what is in effect a &quot; take it or leave it!&apos; basis.This, it is suggested, could be avoided if there were fuller consultation withDominions at a lower level. ^5. In order to meet this point, in which it seems to me there is somesubstance, I suggest the following, after discussion with all concerned here. (Asregards supply questions, the proposals are put forward in agreement with theMinister of Supply and the Minister of Labour and cover the matters which thelatter was recently asked by the War Cabinet to investigate)::  ; i&apos; - (a) In regard to Defence matters. Liaison officers should be appointed by theDominions to keep in touch with the Joint Planning Staff of the Chiefs of Stafforganisation. Such an arrangement would ensure that Dominion representa-fiyes in London were informed of any plans that may affect them at an, early,stage before finality in reached, so that they, or the Dominion authorities; to whomthey, are responsible, would have an opportunity of expressing views while thematter is still in a formative stage. It would be important that the DominionLiaison officers to be appointed should be competent persons of a type likely togain the confidence of the officers here with whom they would have to deal, andshould also be of appropriate rank, neither too junior nor too senior. Thisarrangement for Australia and New Zealand, in relation to the new Far EasternWar Council only, has been approved by the Prime Minister and the DefenceCommittee, and a reference to it has been made in the Prime Ministers telegramto Mr. Curtin and Mr. Eraser referred to in paragraph 2 above.[23365]
2 ... :;r;^_____________^   __________m(b) As regards Foreign Affairs, facilities should be given for a somewhat psimilar liaison system. The details are under discussion with the Foreign Office mand I do not foresee any difficulty in agreeing upon a mutually satisfactory Harrangement.(c) As regards Supply, there are four main questions involved. Ij(i) Raw materials.  It is proposed to form a clearing-house here,&quot; under a IMinisterial chairman, on which the Dominions (and. India and the HColonies) would be represented, to cover supplies from all the Empire, Band the needs of all the Empire. This clearing-house will make it 11possible to present the Empire position as a whole in Washington Mthrough Sir Clive Baillieu, the Ministry of Supply representative Bthere.(ii) The allocation of production. It is proposed that a fairly senior United  jjKingdom officer thoroughly conversant with the machinery of the  MProduction and Service Departments should be appointed as a liaisonofficer to whom the Dominion Governments&apos; representatives in London  Hcould turn when they wish to know how to obtain advice or to ensure  Sthat they are consulted on any particular question....  (iii) The allocation of finished munitions.   This question must really be  BV; . determined on broad strategic grounds. If it is agreed that theDominions should be given representation on the Ministerial planeat which strategic policy is settled, it would follow that appropriate!. machinery should be made available for Dominion representatives tobe brought into consultation in regard to the assignment of finishedmunitions where their interests are concerned. &apos;(iv) Shipping. It is proposed to continue and, as necessary, develop theexisting arrangements whereby the shipping resources and needs of theDominions are co-ordinated in London with our own.6. The above arrangements should, I suggest, be so designed as to cover notmerely Far Eastern questions, which fall within the scope of the new Far EasternWar Council, but all phases of the war effort. Similarly, although the demandfor further facilities of this kind comes from Australia, they should, I suggest,be offered equally to the other three oversea Dominion Governments, even althoughit is, in my opinion, doubtful whether any, except possibly to some extent New-Zealand, may wish to take advantage of them. In particular as regards supplyquestions, it may be necessary to make different arrangements in view of theSpecial geographical position of Canada. The same arrangements could coverIndia and the Colonies if desired.&apos;-&apos; 7. If these proposals are approved, I should propose, in the case of IAustralia, to transmit them to the Commonwealth Government through Sir Earle IPage. He is anxious that this channel should be adopted, and as the ideas are to jjsome extent the result of suggestions put forward by him, it may be useful to let jjhim put them to this Government.8.-   The second sense in which the proposals relating to a Far Eastern War 8Council do not wholly meet the demands put forward, is that the work of this body Mis limited to the Far East and does not cover the whole aspect of war strategy, jjI am setting out in a separate memorandum some proposals for closer co-operation Hwith the Dominion Governments, for purposes of the war generally, on the MMinisterial level and irrespective of the special situation in the Far East. jj9. I should, however, like to be authorised to put to the Dominion Govern- jjments at once the detailed proposals in the present paper without prejudice to Ba decision on the above issue.c.   I
