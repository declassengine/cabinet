THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1942.Copy No.WAR CABINET.AIR TRANSPORT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.CIVILIAN air transport is becoming of increasing importance for theefficient direction of our war effort. Our outlets to neutral and allied countriesare few; but for this reason it is essential that adequate rapid and regularcommunication by air should be available to the Soviet Union, Lisbon, the NearEast, the United States and the Far East.At present, control of the allocation of seats in all aeroplanes now in use(except those engaged in the Stockholm service, which is controlled by the Ministerof Economic Warfare) is concentrated in the hands of the Air Ministry, whoseofficials, assisted by their Priorities Board composed, with one exception, ofService personnel, have done their best to co-operate with their colleagues in theForeign Office and other Departments. But the increasing calls made on theavailable carrying capacity render the task of allocation extremely difficult,entailing as it does a delicate assessment of the rival claims of service andcivilian personnel and secret correspondence.While the Air Ministry must of course be responsible for supervising therunning of such commercial air services as still exist, and operating any serviceaircraft that may be allocated for communication duty, I find it difficult to acceptthat it is within the competence of a single Department of State-andparticularly a Service Ministry-to weigh the rival claims of, for instance,allied personnel on a mission connected with supply, a member of the SecretService proceeding to his station, a King&apos;s Messenger carrying urgent replace-ments of a compromised cypher, a member of the Fighting Services destined totake up an operational appointment, a distinguished actress engaged toentertain the troops or to earn dollars for the Treasury in the United States,a diplomatic official charged with some political negotiation, a corporal whosepresence is required for some technical job, or a parcel of a special materialneeded in connexion with the manufacture of armaments.The Air Ministry have, I repeat, made an entirely praiseworthy attempt todischarge a difficult task which is not properly theirs : but as a result, not onlymy own Department and our Diplomatic representatives, but the IntelligenceServices for which I am responsible, feel that their work is being hamperedand their efforts thwarted by the impossibility of obtaining passages for theirown or allied personnel, or transport, under conditions of proper security, fortheir secret correspondence. Moreover, I am left with a feeling that in manycases, with the details of which I will not detain my colleagues, insufficient weighthas been given to the claims of civilian officials and undue preference has beenaccorded to Service personnel of comparatively junior rank.Further, L note with jealous envy the good fortune enjoyed by certaintalented actresses to whom passages;have been allotted on dates convenient tothem-a fact of which at least one publicity manager has been making good use.11616   [23391]SECRET.W.P. (42) SO.January 31, 1942.
This matter of priority in air passages is of such importance to our war effortthat I consider that, while the Air Ministry should remain responsible for thefunctions described above as properly pertaining to that Department, theallocation of all accommodation in air transport leaving, or coming to, this countryshould be entrusted to an independent Board under the supervision of a Ministerwithout Departmental responsibilities. Such a Board should be composed ofnot less than three or more than five men of standing, together with a secretary ofappropriate rank in the Civil Service and the necessary staff. To start with, atany rate, it would meet daily to adjudicate on the applications advanced by thevarious Departments. It would, no doubt, gradually evolve certain principles inaccord with which its Secretary could deal with ordinary applications of a routinenature. The Board would also deal with all applications for special air transportof an urgent nature, such as for the transmission of secret material to the PrimeMinister when he is overseas. It would only be through the Board that theAir Ministry could receive the applications for special facilities with which itmust be so difficult for them at present to deal.Only by the institution of such a Board, acting under the authority of aMinister, can we be sure that the best use is made of such air transport facilitiesas are at present available.   I therefore ask my colleagues to agree That an independent Board be established under the supervision ofa Minister, to allocate all space in passenger-carrying planes trafficking withthis country.A. E.Foreign Office, January 31, 1942.
