THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet- January 1942.SECRET.,W.P. (42) 40January 27^ 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.AIR SERVICES TO. THE MIDDLE EAST.Report of an Ab hoc Committee.IN accordance with the decisions taken at the Meeting of the War Cabineton the 3rd November, 1941 (WM- (41) 108th Conclusions, Minute io), we haveconsidered &quot;what steps could be taken to improve the air service to the MiddleEast, and by what date the improvements could be effected.&quot;2. Particulars of the service then provided by eight flying-boats with amaximum weekly capacity of some 6,600 lbs. on the West Africa route, and of theneed for a weekly capacity of some 21,600 lbs., are set out in my memorandumof the 30th October, 1941 (W.P. (G) (41) 125).3. The main permanent additional capacity which will be provided on theroute to the Middle East is 3,800 lbs. a week, to be carried through theMediterranean by two &quot;G&quot; boats, which have been transferred from CoastalCommand and are being converted for this service.As a temporary expedient, two Liberators of the British Overseas AirwaysCorporation, each with a capacity of about 3,000 lbs. on special flights to theMiddle East, have been provided, and the first of them will start its first flightin the immediate future. This arrangement should continue for some months,but no guarantee can be given that it will &quot;be permanent.In addition, three Royal Air Force Liberators will very shortly be operatingto Cairo, with an initial frequency of one round flight every ten days, as the firstlink in the air service to Russia. The first has already made a successful directflight to Cairo. It is anticipated that traffic for Russia will not take up morethan a proportion of the 3,000 lbs. available on each flight, and any surplus space,which should be substantial, will be available for traffic for the Middle East.i 4;   The Secretary of State for Air considers (a) that no fully effective operational aircraft should be diverted to thisservice; and(b) that civil mails should not be carried on the air services which areoperated to the Middle East non-stop or through the Mediterranean, butshould be taken by sea transport to West Africa. From there theycan be flown to Cairo and beyond without difficulty.* Secretary of State for the Colonies (in the Chair).First Lord of the Admiralty. vSecretary of State for Air.Minister of Aircraft Production.Postmaster-General.Copy No.[23386]

The Postmaster-General  &apos;-r I   (a) Questions whether we can rely on the permanent use of the Mediterraneanroute for flying boats;. -(b) Urges that fully effective operational aircraft should be diverted to this: ,  : service; and- (c) Is exceedingly reluctant to refuse to accept civil air mails for the MiddleEast and beyond: he emphasizes the vital importance of a regular,rapid service for both military and civil mails.Conclusion.!..-./   6.   The alternatives before the War Cabinet would appear to be : (a) To agree that no further aircraft can be diverted from operational duties,):&apos;  V      and that in consequence no civil mail for the Near East or beyond can\ .   be carried the whole way to the Near East by air, and that the service;i must remain precarious for the other requirements; or(b) To arrange for the diversion from operational duties of a sufficientnumber of suitable aircraft required to increase the weekly average; Capacity for the Near East and beyond, to some 23,000 lbs.The Secretary of State for Air and the First Lord of the Admiraltydissenting, we prefer the second alternative and invite the War Cabinet todirect accordingly.M.On behalf of the Committee.lI(    Colonial Office, S.W.1, ...^   ,   January 27, 1942. &apos;  . &apos;* &apos;! -
