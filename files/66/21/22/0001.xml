THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  January 1942.SECEET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 42.January 28, 1942;WAR CABINET.THE INDIAN POLITICAL SITUATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.1. The Real Issue.THE political deadlock in India to-day is concerned, ostensibly, with thetransfer of power from British to Indian hands. In reality it is mainly concernedwith the far more difficult issue of what Indian hands, what Indian Governmentor Governments, are capable of taking over without bringing about generalanarchy or even civil war.The former issue has been settled in principle by pledge after pledge givenin the name of His Majesty&apos;s Government, culminating in the Viceroy&apos;s definitionin January 1940 of the objective as &quot; full Dominion Status in accordance withthe Statute of Westminster,&quot; and in the promise of full and equal partnershipcontained in the Viceroy&apos;s declaration of August 1940. That declaration furthermade it clear that this status of practical independence was to be attained assoon as possible after the war under a constitution of Indian devising. Itanticipated in the.fullest and most generous sense the general principle enunciatedin Article III of the Atlantic Charter. That its fulfilment must necessitate someprovision for the carrying out of existing obligations is a limitation which wouldnaturally apply no less to any other case in which effect were given to theprinciple of the Atlantic Charter.What would be equally necessary in the application of that principle inIndia or elsewhere is some measure of agreement as to who constitute the peopleor peoples whose freedom of choice as to their form of government is to berespected. That insistence on agreement is, indeed, an essential feature of theAugust Declaration. But it is precisely that feature which has brought to theforefront the true nature of the Indian problem, namely, the existence in India,over and above all other local differences, of two great communities, at least asseparate, and indeed antagonistic, in culture and outlook as any of the contendingnations in Europe. To talk of those two communities as majority and minorityis a dangerous misuse of terms, because it tends to imply that the right of thenumerically smaller community to have its individuality respected is less thanthat of the larger. It is, after all, in defence of that right that we are at warto-day.Yet this fundamental issue has been throughout ignored by the CongressParty which, in spite of efforts to keep a Moslem element in its facade, isessentially a Hindu Party: in its ingrained conviction that it is the natural heirto the British Government in India, and entitled to take over control both oflegislative and executive power, unfettered by any limitations save such&quot;safeguards&quot; for the &quot;minorities&quot; as it has professed to be willing to grant.The issue was, indeed, also largely ignored by Parliament when it based thepresent India Act on the assumption of the possibility for All India of a centralGovernment constituted on British lines, and thought that the position of theMoslem community could be sufficiently safeguarded by separate electorates.Congress was thus afforded an opportunity, which is never likely to recur, ofsecuring effective control of the machinery of Indian Government. But in its&quot;all or nothing&quot; mood it rejected the Act at the Centre for its essentially[23382-1] B
temporary limitations upon full independence and for the &quot; undemocratic&quot;weightage given to the Indian States. -Meanwhile, the experience of Congress Government in the Provinces and, ofthe centralised dictatorship of the Congress &quot; High Command &quot; finally decidedthe Moslems, now increasingly coming together in the Moslem League, to rejectentirely any system of government for India as a whole based on a Parliamentarymajority Executive. The demand for Pakistan, i.e., for the complete separationof the Moslem majority Provinces from the rest of India, embodies this rejectionin its extreme form. It is to be hoped that practical considerations will, in fact,induce the Moslem Provincial leaders in the end to accept some form of All-IndiaGovernment over a carefully limited field and under some mutually agreedconstitution. But Parliamentary Responsible Government for India as envisagedby the Declaration of 1917 and worked out with such infinite care in the Act of1935 is, to my mind, no longer in the picture. The solution can, and must befound; but it will have to be found on different.lines.That was the real meaning of the Declaration of 1940 with its insistence uponagreement between the main elements in India&apos;s national life. That is why itwas welcomed, and is to-day regarded as a solemn pledge, by the Moslems andother &quot; minority &quot; elements, as well as by the Princes. That is why, in spite ofits acceptance of the principle of an Indian-made constitution, the declarationwas regarded by Congress as a direct challenge to its whole position, a directidenial of its claim to speak for India. Congress policy since then has concentratedon one main object: to put pressure upon the British Government to go back upon-the Declaration of 1940. It is in the light of that purpose that we must judgeits past and present political manoeuvres, as well as the efforts of those eminent,and respectable Hindu Moderates who, while deprecating the extremist attitudeof Congress, have continued to turn the same blind eye to the existence of MoslemIndia, and to pin their faith to British Parliamentary Government as the onlysolution of the Indian problem..2. Party Manoeuvres 1940-41.The opening gambit in the Congress game was the campaign of selective civilj disobedience, beginning with the leaders of the Party and intended, by theirexample, to spread ever wider and wider, impressing both India and the outside[world with India&apos;s self-imposed martyrdom in the cause of freedom. Startingin October 1940 the campaign gathered some strength in the opening months of1941, chiefly in the United Provinces, and by May there were some 14,000satyagrahis in prison. But by then it had already lost momentum. New entrantsrapidly declined and were soon exceeded by the release of time-expired prisoners,who, in their turn, showed no inclination to obey Mr. Gandhi&apos;s injunctions toseek re-imprisonment.Meanwhile, in March 1941 a Conference of Moderate leaders met in Bombayunder the presidency of Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru to look for some way of breakingthe deadlock. The real nature of that deadlock was recognised by an initialapproach to Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Jinnah urging them to come together. Butcoming up against a stone wall in that quarter the Moderate leaders nearly allHindus-at once turned back into the easier and more congenial path of puttingHis Majesty&apos;s Government on the defensive by demanding greater powers to begiven to &quot; India,&quot; both immediately and prospectively, without facing the issuehow these powers were to be shared between the contending elements.The demand for an immediate declaration that Dominion Status would begranted within a specified time after the war in effect pushed back upon HisMajesty&apos;s Government the responsibility for finding and imposing their ownsolution by the prescribed date, and gave both the main parties every excuse forrefusing to come to terms with each other and for disagreeing with whateverconstitution might be imposed. The demand for the immediate transfer of fullpower to an entirely Indian Executive Council responsible to the Crown alone,but treated as a Dominion Government, simply ignored the manoeuvring forpower and position which had previously frustrated the Viceroy&apos;s efforts to bringthe party leaders together in an expanded Executive, and would no doubt haveequally frustrated the offer of seats on a Council with greatly enlarged powers.Congress, while not indisposed to encourage the Bombay proposals behindthe scenes, took good care not to associate itself with them. The Moslem Leaguetreated them with contempt, and proceeded in April formally to reaffirm its faithin Pakistan.  The practical difficulties in the way of the Bombay scheme, as well
as the absence of support from either of the main parties, were set out by myselfin the debate on the continuance of Section 93 government in the Provinces inthe same month&apos;.3. The New Interim Constitution.At the same time it was generally felt intolerable that the intransigence orexigences of party leaders should impose a veto on all effective association ofIndians with the government of their country in the present crisis. The Viceroyaccordingly decided to appeal to individual Indian public men of standing andexperience to join his Executive Council, the enlargement of which was in anycase desirable on practical grounds, and to join a National Defence Councilwhich, in an advisory capacity, was intended to serve as a link between the wareffort at the Centre and in the Provinces and States. The Indian members arein a majority of eight to four on the new Executive, while only one European andone Anglo-Indian figure among the 29 members of the National Defence Council.The two bodies between them are as fully representative as possible of theleading personalities of every community and of every shade of political opinionin India, given the fact that actual members/of the present Congress organisationand of the Moslem League are not included. The exclusion of the latter was,however, the result, not of any objection on principle, but of pique onMr. Jinnah&apos;s part at not having been consulted. By a somewhat unscrupuloususe of his almost dictatorial powers in the League, and playing upon the fear ofdisruption of that body, he forced the Premiers of Bengal, of the Punjab andof Assam to resign from the National Defence Council. The Moslem Premier ofSindh, who had already broken with Mr. Jinnah on other grounds, remained,while Mr. Fazlul Huq, the Bengal Premier, has since rejoined, after reconsti-tuting his Government and leaving the League.The expansion of the Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council has marked anoteworthy change in the spirit, if not in the legal structure, of the Governmentof India. The whole government of British India, in all its aspects, and notmerely the powers transferred to an Indian Cabinet under the dyarchical schemeof the 1935 Act, is now within the purview of a Cabinet with a substantialIndian and nonrofficial majority. The Viceroy and his Executive are, no doubt,subject to the overriding authority of the British Cabinet and Parliament. Butthat authority has never been lightly or arbitrarily exercised against theconsidered view of the Government of India, and is even less likely to be sbexercised under the new conditions; :The enlarged Executive has, in fact, shown itself a practical and responsiblebody in which the new members have worked on the best of terms with the Viceroy,with the older members and with each other. They have been responsive toIndian public opinion, but as representative public men and not as party-delegates. They have also effectively remedied one of the gravest weaknesses ofthe Government of India in the past, the absence of Indian speakers both preparedand able to defend the policy of the Government. It is difficult to believe thatthis practical advance in the government of India by Indians has been without itseffect upon public opinion, both in regard to the relations between India and thiscountry and in regard to the relations between the two main communities,&apos; No less successful, within its narrower limits, has been the National DefenceCouncil. The opportunity of hearing the heads of every department, fromGeneral Wavell downwards, frankly and fully expounding and discussing everyaspect of the conduct of the war has made a great impression on all its members,and Provincial Governors have testified to the enthusiasm with which membershave come back to their part in the local war effort. Princes and Provincialrepresentatives have worked most happily together on this, the first All-Indiapolitical body. Here, too, it would seem that the beginning has been made, with-out overt constitutional change, of something that may develop and exercise a realinfluence on the Indian political atmosphere.4. Congress in Confusion. The deadlock continues.As against these positive steps on the part of the Government the futilityof the Congress policy became increasingly obvious to many of the Congressleaders, as well as to the general public. One sign of this was a demand for theresumption of ministerial government in the Provinces, which acquired sufficientforce in one Province, Orissa, to enable the Governor to assent to the formation,     [23382-1] b 2
towards the end of November of a Coalition Government, including severaldissident Congress members. On the other hand, the Coalition Government ofAssam disintegrated a month later and the Governor, failing to find an alterna-tive Ministry prepared to support the war effort, was forced to assume controlunder Section 93. . .Once it had become evident that Mr. Gandhi&apos;s campaign of symbolic civildisobedience no longer constituted in any sense a real challenge to the authorityof the Government, it was an open question whether it was worth while keepingthe dwindling balance of satyagraHs in prison for the full term of their sentences.When the matter was raised in November by a motion in the Assembly theViceroy&apos;s Executive were in favour of release, not in the expectation of anyresponse from Congress itself, but with a view to liquidating a position whichhad become absurd. With the exception of the Governors of the United Provincesand Madras, who feared public disturbance and possible serious reaction on theMoslem League, the Provincial Governments welcomed the proposal, which waseventually sanctioned by His Majesty&apos;s Government. In the event the releasesseem to have left the Indian public tranquilly uninterested. Mr. JawaharlalNehru and Maulana Kalam Azad, the Congress President, were released at thesame time, though strictly speaking they were outside the category of purelysymbolic &quot; protestants.&quot;The effect on Congress was to tear away the veil of pretence which hadenveloped its proceedings. So long as there were still some thousands of&quot;martyrs &quot; in prison it was always possible to make out that something washappening or might happen. Once these were released, and no one could befound willing to take their places, it was difficult for anyone but Mr. Gandhihimself to discover that Congress still had any policy. On top of this came thewar with Japan with its more immediate threat to the actual security of Indianlives and property. The demand for a more realist policy on the part of manyCongress leaders came to a head at the meeting of the Working Committee atthe end of the year at Bardoli, and led to Mr. Gandhi&apos;s resignation of theleadership.It is typical of Congress methods that the breach of the majority of theWorking Committee with Mr. Gandhi was ostensibly on the question of uncon-ditional non-violence based on theoretical pacifism versus a non-violence basedon opposition to the Government but capable of modification in the event of adirect threat to India. On this latter basis the Working Committee resolved,not indeed to offer to co-operate with the Government, but to declare that &apos;&apos; onlya free and independent India can be in a position to undertake the defence ofthe country on a national basis,&quot; that &quot; the whole background in India is oneof hostility and distrust of the British Government, and not even the most far-reaching promises can alter this background, nor can subject India offer voluntaryhelp to arrogant Imperialism,&quot; and to announce that it was back to the positionwhich it had adopted a year before in Bombay, when it had rescinded the so-calledPoona offer, i.e., back to the demand for an immediate and unqualified recogni-tion of Indian independence under a constitution to be settled by an All-IndiaConstituent Assembly based on universal suffrage, in other words, by Congress.The Bardoli resolution has since been unanimously endorsed by the All-IndiaCommittee meeting at Wardha on the 16th January.On the face of it there is no change of policy from the extreme intransigenceof last year. In fact, however, there is no doubt that some of the more moderateleaders, like Mr. Rajagopalachariar, would be willing to make some partialtemporary concession if they could get their way on what is for them essential,i.e., on some immediate measure of constitutional advance which would ensurefuture Congress control of the situation. They have accordingly done all in theirPower, through the Press, to create the impression that they are, in fact, readyto co-operate, and are only waiting for the Government to take some initiativeto which they can respond. How little even the moderates are ready to committhemselves to any practical suggestion is shown by Mr. Hajagopalachariar&apos;sanswer to a question on this point at the Wardha meeting : &apos;&apos; The BritishGovernment know what we want.   Therefore, we need not reiterate it.&quot;The Moslem League, whose Working Committee met at Nagpur immediatelyafter the Bardoli meeting, was equally careful to avoid any precise declarationof its intentions. It began by &quot;warning the British public and Governmentthat a departure from the solemn declaration and pledges of the 8th-August,1940, would constitute a gross breach of faith .... and would be resisted by
Moslems with all force at their command, thus resulting in serious impedimentto the war effort.&quot; On the other hand, it went on to declare &quot; its readiness asbefore to shoulder the burden of defence singly or in co-operation with otherparties on the basis that a real share and responsibility is given in Governmentat the Centre and in the Provinces within the present constitution, but withoutprejudice to the major issues involved in the framing of the future constitution.&quot;This is, no doubt, on the face of it, a more reasonable attitude. But everythingturns on the League&apos;s interpretation of what it means by a &quot; fair share &quot; ofpower for itself. There is nothing in Mr. Jinnah&apos;s previous or recent utterances,public or private, to indicate that his idea of a fair share and that of Congress(or, indeed, of the Viceroy) can be reconciled.5. The Sapru Memorial.On the 2nd January Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, Sir Srinivasa Sastri,Mr. Jayakar and ten other Moderate leaders cabled to the Prime Minister theirsuggestions for an immediate ending of the political deadlock. Admitting that&apos;&apos; detailed discussions of the question of the permanent constitution may wellwait until after victory is achieved,&quot; they appeal for some immediate &quot;boldstroke of far-sighted statesmanship .... to enlist India&apos;s wholehearted activeco-operation in intensifying the war effort.&quot; This, they urge, should be inthe nature of a declaration that &quot; India is no longer to be treated as adependency to be ruled from Whitehall, and that henceforth her constitutionalposition and powers should be identical with those of other units of the BritishCommonwealth.The &quot; concrete measures &quot; by which it is suggested that this declaration isto be implemented are : (1) Conversion and expansion of the Central Executive Council into a trulyNational Government consisting entirely of non-officials of all therecognised parties and communities and in charge all portfoliossubject only to responsbility to Crown.(2) Restoration in Provinces now ruled autocratically by Governors,with Section 93, of popular Governments broad based on the confidenceof different classes and communities : failing this establishment ofnon-official Executive Councils responsible to the Crown as proposedfor Centre.(3) Recognition of India&apos;s right to direct representation through men chosen. by the National Government in the Imperial War Cabinet should suchbody be set up, and in all Allied War Councils wherever establishedand at the Peace Conference.(4) Consultation with the National Government on precisely the same footingand to the same extent as His Majesty&apos;s Government consult DominionGovernments in all matters affecting the Commonwealth as a wholeand India in particular.These are described as &apos;&apos; war measures whose adoption need in no wayprejudice the claims or demands of different parties with regard to India&apos;sfuture constitution,&quot; but also as the very minimum which could resolve the crisis.Coming from men of such high standing and undoubted patriotism, this appealhas received wide-spread publicity.The essence of the proposal is in the first item. What precisely is meantby responsibility to the Crown alone is not quite clear. But whether it meansthat the final decision on all issues is to rest on the Viceroy personally or on themajority in this new National Government, it would, in fact, mean transfer ofthe ultimate responsibility for the Government of India, not to a duly constitutedand generally acceptable system of Indian Government, but to an irresponsibleindividual or to a handful of men nominated by the party leaders.It may be said that this part of the proposal is in the nature of a rhetoricalflourish and that all that is intended is that Whitehall should declare its intentionof interfering as little as possible with an all-Indian all-party Executive. Buthere we come to the real crux of the problem. What prospect is there of any agree-ment between the two main parties either upon the principle of such an Executiveor upon its application in respect of the allocation of places ? The signatoriesto the appeal of whom, incidentally, only two are Moslems are in no sensecapable of delivering the goods. Nothing, so far, in the attitude of Congress as a
whole would suggest that it would accept even the principle, especially ifit were clearly understood that the future constitution is definitely outside thepurview of the new Government and that the pledge of 1940 holds good. TheMoslem League might accept on that understanding, though probably demandinga further pledge to the effect that Pakistan is not ruled out as the ultimatesolution. But it would almost certainly insist on more places than the Hinduparties would consider for a moment. That the two main parties would of them-selves come together to put forward an agreed demand on the Sapru lines seemspractically excluded.Should the British Government then take the initiative and announce itsintention of framing such an all-Indian party leader Government, either with orwithout participation by Congress? Success is, to say the least of it, doubtful.However doubtful, it would be well worth attempting if it were really likely tobring about general agreement and increase the intensity of India&apos;s war effort.With every desire to see some broad, generous gesture &quot; touching the heart &quot; ofIndia, and bringing its contending elements into unison with each other and withthe British Government, I cannot see this resulting. Such a new Executive, if itcould be got together, would certainly not be as efficient as the existing Executivefrom the purely administrative point of view. Depending, as its members would,on parties which are more concerned with the struggle against each other forfuture power than with anything else, it would be far less likely to coalesce intoa harmonious working team. It might easily become so unmanageable as to breakup or have to be dismissed. Or, again, its members might be tempted to outbideach other in demands calculated in a moment of crisis to appeal to the leaststeady elements of the public, e.g., for the recall of all Indian troops to withinthe frontiers of India. It would be different if there were any evidence of theleaders of the two main communities being genuinely willing to sink theirdifferences in a common desire to save India. As it is there is no justification forscrapping or discrediting a predominantly Indian Executive, which is workingwell, in order to embark, on the almost certainly fruitless attempt to secure onewhich, if secured, would, at best, be inferior, and, at worst, a real danger.The other recommendations of the Sapru memorial are in a different category.Items 3 and 4 are really matters of degree. While the ultimate responsibilitymust remain here until it can be duly transferred, there is no reason why, to anincreasingly wider extent,, the views of the Government of India should not beaccepted without question in respect of the representation of British India oninter-Imperial or international occasions, or the consultations between the twoGovernments not be on the footing of free and equal discussion. As for therestoration of ministerial government in the provinces, that clearly rests withCongress itself. If it really has the slightest intention of co-operating there isthe field in which its co-operation can be immediately exercised, both directlyin the administration of civil defence and more generally through membershipof the National Defence Council.6. Conclusion.I agree, therefore, with the Viceroy&apos;s conclusion in his telegram No. 104-S.(W.P. (42) 43) that there is no immediate further interim constitutionaladvance that we can make. We have in the 1940 Declaration a long-term policywhich is not only generous and far-reaching, but the only long-term policy whichcan achieve a settlement. We cannot go back on the pledges which it embodies :our business is to stand by it and expound it confidently and with conviction andnot apologetically. We have in the present Central Executive and NationalDefence Council as representative and as efficient an instrument for associatingIndia with her war effort as we, are likely to get, at this juncture, withoutaggravating her internal discords&quot;. We can and should make the most of it bythe consideration and respect we give to it, not only in matters of inter-Imperialand international status, but in the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Governmenttowards it. On that ground we can, I believe, weather the immediate stormwhich is sweeping down upon India.- L. S. A.India Office,January 28, 1942.
