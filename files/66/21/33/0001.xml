THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC&apos;MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  February 1942.SECRETW.P. (42) 53.February 1, 1942.WAR CABINET.INDIAN CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS.&apos; Memorandum by Secretary of State for India.1. proposed reply to the telegram from Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and others to thePrime Minister.THE text of the reply which, with the full agreement of the Viceroy-, Irecommend should be sent to the telegram (Appendix A) addressed to the Prime;Minister by Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and others will be found at Appendix B. Indrafting the reply I have followed the general line advocated by the Viceroy atthe end of his telegram of the 21st January (W.P. (42) 43), namely,, that ofsetting our refusal of the Sapru proposals against the background of our very farreaching and generous Declaration of August 1940, and of the pledges there givento the Muslims and the Princes. Similarly, the draft emphasises the importanceof the interim advance already made,; the value of the present &quot;Executive and theobjections to displacing it.2. Indian representation at meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet.The general assurance given in paragraph 7 of the draft reply toSir Tej Bahadur Sapru- as to India&apos;s status in inter-Imperial and internationalaffairs really only conforms, at any rate in outward form, to what has been theestablished practice since the last war, though, of course, questions of personneland their instructions have naturally been, and would continue to be, subject toinformal consultation with the Viceroy.  In the light of the decision with regardto Australian and New Zealand representation at the War Cabinet, the Viceroyhas himself suggested that there would be advantage in posting a Member of hisI Council in London whp would be available to represent the views q*f his Govern-I ment to me and in the Imperial War Cabinet.  In view of India&apos;s at least equalf interest in the Far Eastern situation, I strongly support the Viceroy&apos;s proposal.The question of a representative of the Princes also coming over (as at previousImperial Conferences and War Cabinets) may possibly arise later.The precedents for the Government of lndia&apos;s representation in additionto representation by the Secretary of Slate for India at the Imperial Conferenceand in the Imperial War Cabinet date back for 25 years, Indian representativesassociated with the Secretary of State having attended both these bodies in 1917and in 1918. As regards the latter, the Prime Minister announced in Parliamenton the 17th May, 1917, that the Imperial War Cabinet had accepted his proposalthat at future meetings &quot;the Imperial Cabinet should consist of the PrimeMinister of the United Kingdom and such of his colleagues as deal speciallywith Imperial affairs, of the Prime. Minister of each of the Dominions or somespecially accredited alternate possessed of equal authority, and of a representa-tive of the Indian people to be appointed by the Government of India/&apos; It wassubsequently arranged that in addition to the full Member nominated by theGovernment of India, a; representative of the Indian States would attend at theinvitation of the Prime; Minister At subsequent meetings of the Imperial[23416] &apos;&apos;&apos;-- ^ b:
Conference, the Secretary of State has continued to. lead the Indian delegation,which, normally, in addition to himself has consisted of a representative ofBritish India and a representative of the Indian States selected by the Viceroyin (private) consultation with the Secretary of State and acting under instruc-tions prepared in India but similarly approved by him. It had been contemplatedthat, after the inauguration of an Indian Federation, the Secretary of Statewould still lead the Indian delegation, although associated with Indianrepresentatives appointed by and answerable to Indian authorities. The Federalconstitution, of course, envisaged that the Governor-General would exercise&quot;reserved&quot; functions in regard to external affairs and defence, whereas atpresent these matters are not reserved to the Governor-General, but, in principlefall within the scope of the Governor-General in Council-and the Governor-General&apos;s Council is responsible not to the Indian Legislature, but through theSecretary of State to Parliament. Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and those associatedin his representations to the Prime Minister have urged as part of their claimthat the Government of India should become forthwith responsible to the Crownonly, and not to the Crown in Parliament, that Indian representatives should infuture be controlled by the Government of India and not by the Secretary ofState or His Majesty&apos;s Government. The reply to Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru whichI have proposed does not concede this claim. In any case; whatever may be theformal position as between the Secretary of, State and representatives of theIndian Government, as at present constituted, attending an Imperial WarCabinet, the nature of the discussions and the procedure there need not be heldto be an obstacle to the free expression of the views of the latter in so far as theymay be independent of those of the Secretary of State.&apos;3s&quot; New&apos;&apos;dppointfh,eWts t&amp;:phe-Governo-r-QeneraV s E-see&amp;iitive Council.Certain changes have to be made in the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council owingto the recent death of Sir Akbar Hydari, Member for Information, and theimpending appointment of Sir A. Clow, Member for Communications, to beGovernor of Assam. The Viceroy&apos;s consequent proposals for reconstructing hisGovernment are connected with the question of its representation in this country.I set out below the names of the existing posts and their holders, and of thoseproposed to succeed them where changes are contemplated:-Commander-in-ChiefHome ....FinanceCommunications (now to bereconstituted and renamedTransport)........Education, Health and LandsCommerceLabour        ....      ....      ....LawIndians Overseas    ........Information ....Supply        ...........Mieniber without Portfolio....1&apos;.; jj -        jj j)General Sir A.

Benthall, who is senior partner of Bird &amp; Co., Calcutta,has a high standing with the European business community. He is at presentemployed in the Ministry of Economic Warfare here. Sir Muhammad Usmanis a respected Muslim politician in Madras who has acted as Governor. Like theother Mohammedan Members of the Council, he is not a member of the MuslimLeague. Mr. Ambedkar is the political leader of the depressed classes, of whoserights he has been a doughty champion. The Sikh Member is needed to give avoice to a small community, which nevertheless is strongly represented in thefighting forces of India. One of the two Members at present designated to bewithout portfolio would be available for posting to the office vacated by the
Member of the Viceroy&apos;s Council whom he proposes to send home to representhis Government^ views.It must, of course, be recognised that the proposed additions, whilestrengthening the Council as an organ for transacting India&apos;s war business, willnot afford any satisfaction to the main political parties in India or be regardedas contributing to meet the desiderata of Sir T. B. Sapru and his associates,except in so far as they facilitate provision for direct representation of the IndianGovernment here by one of its Members.To summarise, I propose : (1) A draft reply from the Prime Minister to Sir T. B. Sapru and hisassociates;(2) that a representative of the Indian Government and, when desired bythe Viceroy, an Indian Prince, should attend with myself meetingsof the War Cabinet at times when the war effort with especialreference to India is under discussion;(3) that the expansion of the Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council pro-;; posed with a view to enabling one of its Members to visit this countrybe approved.L.

Telegram from Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and others to the Prime Minister, datedJanuary 2, 1942.Gravity International situation compels some of us who have spent longyears in public life India make this appeal you Prime Minister realise urgentnecessity for transforming entire spirit and outlook administration India.Detailed discussions of question permanent Constitution may well wait morepropitious times until after victory achieved in this titanic struggle againstforces threatening civilisation. But some bold stroke far-sighted Statesmanshipcalled for without delay in India at this hour of growing danger to her safety toenlist her whole-hearted active co-operation intensifying war effort. Millionsmen women required for adoption effective measures designed protect civilianpopulation. Heart of India must be touched to rouse her on nation-wide scaleto call for service undistracted by internal and domestic differences. Is it notpossible for you declare this juncture that India no longer be treated asdependency to be ruled from Whitehall and henceforth her Constitutionalposition and powers identical with those other units British Commonwealth. Suchdeclaration should, we suggest, be accompanied concrete measures calculatedimpress people that in co-operating war effort they are safeguarding their ownfreedom.  These measures are :1. Conversion and expansion Central Executive Council into truly NationalGovernment consisting entirely non-officials of all recognised partiesand communities and in charge all portfolios subject onlyresponsibility to Crown.2. Restoration in Provinces now ruled autocratically by GovernorsSection 93 Government of India Act of popular Governments broadbased on confidence different classes and communities; failing thisestablishment non-official Executive Councils responsible to; Crown asj proposed for Centre.I] 3. Recognition India&apos;s right to direct representation through men chosenby National Government in Imperial War Cabinet should such-bodyiil jbjgrset up, and in all Allied War Councils wherever established and&quot;at Peace Conference.4. Consultation with National Government precisely same footing and sameextent as His Majesty&apos;s Government consult Dominion Governmentsin all matters affecting Commonwealth as whole, and India inparticular.These are war measures whose adoptions need no way prejudice claims ordemands different parties regard to India&apos;s permanent Constitution. Butknowing intimately feelings aspirations our countrymen as we do we must expressour conviction that nothing less than inauguration this policy can resolve crisisin India. Urgency immediate action cannot be over emphasised. We appealyou in all sincerity, but with greatest emphasis, to act while there is still timefor such action so that India may line up with other Anti-Axis Powers on footingabsolute equality with them in common struggle for freedom humanity. Sincethis is matter vital interest to public India and Britain, we propose givingstatement publicity in press both countries.   Signatories are : Tej Bahadur Sapru, Allahabad.

Proposed Reply from the Prime Minister to Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and others.You will, I am sure, understand that it was not possible for me beforereturning from Washington to reply to your cable of the 2nd January. Nothing,less than a full and carefully considered answer could do justice to an appeal1coming from yourself and your co-signatories, patriotic men who have given sucheminent service to India and to the British Commonwealth, and whose earnestdesire to see India whole-heartedly united in the struggle against the forcesthreatening civilisation we all gratefully recognise.2. You ask whether it is not possible for me to declare at this juncture thatIndia is no longer to be treated as a dependency to be ruled from Whitehall, andthat henceforth her constitutional position and powers are to be identical withthose of the other units of the British Commonwealth. I can only reply that itis, indeed, our sincere desire that India should control her own affairs in the sameposition of freedom and equality of status as is enjoyed by the United Kingdomand the other units of our Commonwealth. To that aim the Government which Ihave the privilege to lead solemnly pledged itself in the Viceroy&apos;s declaration ofAugust 1940, and to that pledge I readily once more give my personalendorsement.3. The Viceroy&apos;s declaration, moreover, made it clear that we were anxiousto implement that pledge with the least possible delay after the principal elementsin India&apos;s national life have come to an agreement on the constitutional frame-work on which India&apos;s self-rule is to rest. The definite conclusion to thisproblem must, as you have pointed out, necessarily wait until after victory hasbeen achieved, though I see no reason why the discussion of its many facets shouldnot proceed even now between Indian political leaders and thinkers.4. What I find it more difficult to understand is the procedure by which yousuggest that the goal upon which we are all agreed can, in fact, be achieved atthis moment in isolation from any solution of the problem of India&apos;s futureconstitutional structure, or how the powers which we both wish to see transferredto an Indian system of government can be so transferred otherwise than to someestablished form of government resting on some definite basis of responsibilityand enjoying general acceptance.5. Your first suggestion in this connexion is that the existing CentralExecutive Council should be converted into a &apos;&apos; truly National Governmentconsisting entirely of non-officials of all recognised parties and communities andin charge of all portfolios subject only to its responsibility to the Crown.&quot; TheGovernor-General &apos;s Executive Council has recently been expanded and nowcomprises a substantial majority of Indian and non-official members. If thesedo not include representatives of the two most important party organisationsthat is certainly not the fault of His Majesty&apos;s Government or of the Viceroy,who used his best endeavours last year to secure their inclusion. In that Councilboth the new members and the older members with their special experience haveworked most effectively together. Under their general guidance India is puttingforth a remarkable effort in this raising and equipping of her forces, and thoseforces, voluntarily recruited, have shown by their spontaneous valour and devotiontheir belief in the cause for which they are fighting. I should gravely hesitatebefore accepting the conclusion that at a moment like this the displacement, lock,stock and barrel, of the present Executive by new members, even if morerepresentative of the party organisations, would in fact increase the efficiency ofgovernment, give added confidence to the troops or enlarge the volume and activityof the support given to the war effort by the general public. In any case it isdifficult for me to consider that aspect of the question without some more definiteevidence that the main parties are in fact now prepared as they have not beenhitherto to agree, both as a matter of principle and in respect to their respectiverepresentation, to participate in the work of such an expanded Council.
6. I come now to the other feature of this first suggestion, namely, that theproposed National Government should only be responsible to the Crown. Atpresent the ultimate responsibility of the Central Government of India is to theCrown in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. We are agreed in wishing tosee it transferred to the Crown in the Legislative and Executive scheme of anIndian government. But to whom is it proposed that the suggested immediatetransfer should be made ? Is the Governor-General to become a personal autocratamenable to no form of constitutional control ? Or is the final and indisputableauthority over all Indian affairs to rest in a majority vote 5f the new Executive?I cannot persuade myself that either of these alternatives would be eonstitu-tionally satisfactory or really acceptable to Indian public opinion.7. On the other hand, leaving on one side this question of ultimate responsi-bility, I hope I may be able to set your mind at rest with regard to the pointsraised in your third and fourth suggested measures. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentis only too anxious that Indians position should be recognised internationally andinter-Imperially. She was represented in the Imperial War Cabinets of 1917and 1918 in the last war, at the Peace Conference, and since then at the Leagueof Nations and at Imperial Conferences. The Government of India has in theselast few weeks subscribed to the declaration of aims by the 26 &quot; United Nations &quot;through its own representative at Washington. I can readily give you theassurance that in connexion ydth.,any..iBter-Imperial or inter-Allied organisationthat maj.be&apos;setjip&apos;durinjr the war, as well as with the eventual Peace Conference,His^MajesTy^s^overnment here has no desire to dictate to the Government ofIndia either the selection of its representatives or the instructions which thatGovernment may decide to give them.8. Nor has His Majesty&apos;s Government here any desire to interferegratuitously with the Government of India in the ordinary course of its adminis-tration. It cannot, as I have pointed out, ask Parliament to divest itself of itsultimate statutory responsibility for India except to a properly constituted andgenerally acceptable Indian Government. But short of that it is its intention,and, indeed, its practice, to conduct its relations with the Government of Indiaso far as possible on the same footing of intimate and unfettered mutual consul-tation as governs its consultation with the Governments of the Dominions.9. So far, indeed, as the Provinces are concerned, His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave only assumed the responsibility for their direct control owing to the refusalof their then existing Ministries to fulfil their constitutional obligations to thepeople whose suffrages they had secured. The restoration of popular government,&apos;&apos; broad-based on confidence between different classes and communities,&apos;&apos; as askedfor in your second suggested measure, is a matter essentially in the. hands of therepresentatives, of the people in each province. As the recent example of Orissahas shown, Governors are only too willing to welcome the return to office of anyParty or Coalition of Parties that is prepared, with the support of a majorityof the Provincial Legislature, to undertake the responsibilities of office underpresent conditions. His Majesty&apos;s Government would regard such resumptionof office as the most obvious and practical method of co-operation in the commoneffort, more particularly in view of the importance of the tasks in connexionwith civil defence which fall within the purview of the Provincial Governments.10. I have put these difficulties to you, not as a mere excuse for inaction, butbecause the transcendent importance and complexity of the task before us makesit essential that we should set about it both on the right lines and in the rightspirit. The problem is a double one: on the one hand, how to transfer theultimate control of the Government of India from a British to an Indian autho-rity; on the other, how to create an Indian authority which can take over thatcontrol without risk of grave internal discord or disruption.11. Each of these two complementary aspects presents its difficulties. Thereare many intricate matters arising from the long interlocking of Britishadministration with Indian life which can only be resolved by careful planningand by mutual goodwill-goodwill which, on our part, will certainly be forth^coming. But even, these difficulties, are small compared with the task of devisinga framework of government within which nearly four hundred millions of thehuman race can live in permanent peace with each other and co-operate effectively
alike for their defence and for their economic welfare and social progress, andyet do so without fettering or overriding the individual freedom and way of lifeof the various profoundly different elements which make up the great sum total:12. That task, the greatest that human statesmanship has yet essayed, isessentially one for Indians to settle among themselves. No scheme that could bedevised by Parliament here could either respond so closely to Indian needs, orsecure the goodwill so essential to its successful operation, as one contrived byIndian brains in accordance with Indian conceptions and Indian sentiments andby fair compromise and free agreement between the main elements of India&apos;snational life. It is to that high task that we have invited Indian statesmanshipto devote itself, assured at every stage of our willing co-operation.13. Meanwhile, we are engaged in a struggle to the death against forceswhose victory would mean the end of all Indian aspirations for the future. Youhave been proud, and rightly proud, of the achievement of India&apos;s soldiers onso many a hard-fought field. By standing together with each other and withtheir comrades from, every part of the British Empire they have not only wonimperishable renown for themselves but have strengthened the foundation uponwhich India&apos;s future self-reliance must depend. Shall we not do well, in theinterest of that future, to follow their example and concentrate all our effortsat this grave hour upon the common task of saving ourselves and savingcivilization ? In doing so I believe we may all British and Indian, Hindu andMoslem, British Indian statesmen and Indian Princes come closer together, andso do more to promote the constitutional solution, upon whose general characterwe are all agreed, than by any attempt to recast the foundations of IndianGovernment, in advance of any agreement as to the nature of the future consti-tutional solution, and under conditions which inevitably preclude dueconsideration either in India or in Parliament.Note by the Secretary of State for India.Since receiving the Viceroy&apos;s agreement to the draft set out above I have, inthe light of recent developments, drafted a somewhat more guarded assurance withreference to representation as a possible alternative to the last sentence ofparagraph 7 of the draft.   This is as follows : &apos;&apos; I can readily give you the assurance that the Indian Government willbe afforded full opportunity for the presentation of their views when mattersaffecting the defence of India are under discussion in the War Cabinet, orin any other inter-Imperial or inter-Allied body which may be set up duringthe war and that His Majesty&apos;s Government here have no desire to dictateto the Government of India the selection of any Representatives that theymay wish to send for this purpose. The Viceroy has been invited to putforward his Governments suggestions in that connection. I need hardlyadd that at the eventual Peace Conference India will have her ownRepresentatives, and that in this connection, too, His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave no desire to dictate the selection of them, nor the instructions on whichthey will act.&quot;L.
