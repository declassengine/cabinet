(o)   Ah agreed broadcast, putting the findings of the Report as an audit inproper perspective and ^viting the ^continued co-operation of all concerned toassist the Government in their general policy of using rare. skill for essentialpurposes.    The 6,000 men whose-, names Iraye teen sent by the Committee to theWar Office are a part only of all the loan ijvtbe Army Tivho ought to he examinedsince names, were supplied only by members of the Engineering Employers&apos;Federation.   &apos;Th6re-: are&quot; v^/&apos;w^.!e^lx*&amp;tt outside the Federation.    The hopeof ttee Committee had been thai early publicity for&apos; their- Report obuld he theoccasion of.a general invitation to send names to the Committee forinvestigation by the Services.E. In reply to the Committee, the War Office Memorandum uses the followingarguments:-   that the Committee ignore the operational requirements of fightingoverseasf&apos; .that the-Committee, while. complaining of failure to use skilled men,provide their own answer by saying that war involves standing^by for emergencies;and- that the Commit bee&apos;s judgment of tber Army use of men&apos;- is. based on interviewing159 men and that their classification of these men is inaccurate because basedon&apos;incomplete infbrimtion. as to the. work being done by the men.The first of these arguments.is without justification.    The Committee fullyrealised the conditions undpr which repairs of machines of war would need to bedone in action:   they. kn*,iw all about -forward echelons and the difference betweenthe Army and Navy or R*A*F. repair conditions (specially noted in a Memorandumby the Chairman circulated to the Committee).    In paragraph 33 of the Report theCommittee refer expressly .to the fact that need, to repair armoured vehicles meansthat in any case&quot; there-must be skilled.men and machines hear the front line..The view of the Committee is that these skilled men and machines might deal withthe&apos;rare mechanical emergencies for which at present men are kept idly waitingin&apos; the Royal: Engineers. . -The second argument is based upon quoting two sentences from paragraph 31 ofthe Committee&apos;s Report, while omitting the sentences which follow immediately.War means some standing-hy, but the Committee&apos;s point&apos;was that standing-hy, ofskilled engineers in idleness&apos; could and should be reduced to&apos;a minimum bypooling.of mechanicalresources.,The third argument.ignores whole sections of the. Committee&apos;s report. . Their-conclusions were--based not On the 139;headquarters,.interviews but on.confirmationof these interviews.(a) by the Station interviews described in paragraph 10 andAppendix B. and (b):by the analysis.of employers&apos; lists&apos; described in.paragraphs 12and 13,    This analysis of a body of engineers shows that &apos; the Navy and theAir Force, each in. their different ways, make good use of the engineers who cometo them&apos;&apos;but that &apos;among those: entering the Army, the proportion advanced to  -skilled engineering posts is only one in seven, and at. the end of two-years-..of.war more than half those men whose civil occupations were engineering, had notbeen mustered in any engineering trade i ;    As regards the reclassifications ofthe-139 cases by the War. Office^ classification is a. matter of -judgment..    TheCommittee conducted all their interviews with the help, of Service&quot;.representativesand set out the facts for each man.in detail, -recognising that in some cases,reference to the units would put a different colour on the picture.    The-Committee have not boen given, the information on whioh the War Office describetheir classification, as * inaccurate&apos; and naturally cannot accept the .-&apos;description.    The-broad issue is that, the YiTar Office probably do take adifferent view from the Committee, of what is an adequate use of a skilledengineersF. The Committee should be regarded not as hostile critios. of the Services butas candid friends ^ convinced by their first enquiry of the need to ensureadequate maintenance of war machines and desiring to help the. Services to getall the men needed for this purpose.    For the R*A.0,C. the Committee aresatisfied that a large increase of technicians is necessary, though they believethat the bulk of these can be ^supplied ,fr.om other parts of the. Army, it is to behoped that withdrawal of. the Army*s demand for. engineering tradesmen fromindustry will hot mean that the R.A.Q.C. go short of such men,&quot;&apos; The Committeehave recommended also that all the demands of the R.A..0.C* for. technicalcommissioned officers&apos; should be met and that a substantial number ofnon-commissioned officers (Armament Artificers) should be obtained fromindustry&apos;by volunteering.    But they believe, that, to .give industry.and thepublic reassurance as to the abiliiy and intention of the Army, to use&apos; &apos;skilled engineers for skilled work is a&apos;condition of obtaining i&amp;e menrequired, ...... &apos;-.-.&quot;&apos; &apos; &apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;    W.
