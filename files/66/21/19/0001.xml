97/fGAS(THIS IX)CUHENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC L[AjjsTY&apos;S GOVERN!lESnTv)SECRETW.P, (42) 39.COPY NO.-   - -0126th.JANUARY 1942.WAR CABINET.MEMORANDUM BY MINISTER OP INFORMATION.PUBLICATION OP POSSIBLE TROOP M0VE1CENTSIt     The War Cabinet asked me to enquire into the statement on thissubject which appeared in the Daily Express &quot;on January 13th. .2*     The statement consisted,of- an extract from a leading article in theSydney Daily Telegraph, which had been Cabled to the Daily Express bytheir correspondent in Sydney.    It demanded the immediate reinforcementof troops-in Malaya and  in   the Netherlands East.Indies and criticisedwhat it described as &quot;the &quot;clumsy1 method whereby United States troopswill relieve British troops in Northern Ireland, enabling British troopsto relieve Australians in the &quot;fiddle East, who in turn will be.&apos; withdrawnfor the relief of Singapore&quot;,3. ,[! Newspapers receiving this statement were not obliged to submit itfor censorship, since it consisted, entirely of quotations from an articlewhich had already been published and released for transmission overseasby the Australian censors.   Even if it had been submitted, the censorswould have had no reasonable grounds for intervention.   Under presentrules they can intervene only on security grounds in order to prevent thedisclosure of information &quot;which would be- of value to the enemy.    Once thisarticle had been published in Australia it could be telegraphed to anypart of the -world.   It had thus become generally available to&quot; the enemy.The censors would not, therefore, have been justified in trying to preventits republication in the United States.   .B. B.
