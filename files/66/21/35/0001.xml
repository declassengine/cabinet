Kingdom and the Governments of theother members of the British Commonwealth on matters of
urgency connected with the war.     Further, that it hasresulted from the United States entry into the war and recentdevelopments in the Pacific and also from the request of theAustralian Government c ,Speaking for the Canadian Government I may say that theexisting machinery for consultation between not only theGovernment of Great Britain and Canada, but also betweenCanada and the Governments of the other Dominions has, in ouropinion, worked exceedingly well.     If at, ariy time in thefuture we should find the means of consultation inadequate tomeet the new developments which have arisen or which maydirseour,Government will not only be prepared but glad toavail itself of the supplementary arrangement to nave ourviews presented to the War Cabinet of Great Britain by anaccredited representative in accordance with the procedurewhich was.announced yesterday by the Prime Minister of GreatBritain.
