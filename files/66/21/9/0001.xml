THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  January 1942.SECRET.W.P. (42) 29.January 21, 1942.WAR CABINET.CO-OPERATION WITH THE DOMINION GOVERNMENTS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. ,; AS the Cabinet will know, the question of further Dominion representationin the conduct of the war has, as a result of the extension of the conflict to theFar East, again come very much to the fore.&apos; Up to the present, the agitation hasbeen confined almost entirely to Australia and certain sections of opinion in thiscountry. With these last, I do not, in this note, propose to concern myself. ButI feel I ought to let my colleagues know my views with regard to the situationin Australia. It would, I believe, be a great and possibly disastrous mistake forus to underestimate the strength of the feeling which is arising in the Common-wealth on this question. Evidence of this is coming in from all quarters. Thereis first and foremost the attitude of the Australian Press, as shown in telegramsNos. 29 and 47 (Annexes I and II) from Sir Ronald Cross. The expression oftheir views is, of course, more or less restrained, according to the character of thenewspaper. But no one who reads the extracts can fail to recognise the unanimityof the demand for further representation by Australia, representation which sheclaims as a definite right. A partial explanation of this unanimity is no doubtto be found in Sir Ronald Cross&apos;s telegram No. 37 (Annex III), which makes itabundantly clear that the agitation is being stoked up by the Australian Govern -ment itself, and particularly by Mr. Evatt, who is Steadily gaining influence inthe counsels of his party. But it should be noted that Sir Ronald states that&quot; Mr. Curtin&apos;s New Year message tends increasingly under the impact of the badnews to become representative.&quot; &quot; The movement is, in fact, becoming a nationalone; and should Australia suffer acutely in the coming struggle, a permanentweakening of Australian ties with the United Kingdom may well result.&quot; Thisis also the view of the Governor-General, Lord Gowrie, than whom no Englishmanhas a wider experience of Australian politics and the Australian people.Sir Earle Page and Mr. Bruce, too, are clearly becoming increasingly worriedabout the way things are going. This is a situation which, I suggest, cannot beallowed to continue. A rot which started in Australia might easily spread toother Dominions. Already in South Africa, on the 14th January, Dr. Malan hasused the Australian precedent as an argument for the loosening of ties betweenthe Union and Great Britain.If this tendency is not to gain in velocity and become uncontrollable, it must,I suggest, be tackled now and by radical methods. And it must be tackled by agenerous gesture to Australia, the main centre of trouble. Already, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are studying proposals for affording to her a closer liaison, both withour Defence Organisation and with the Foreign Office, at a low level, so that herpoint of view may be taken into account at the early stages when policy is beingformulated. I hope very much that these proposals which I have set out in aseparate memorandum will receive the approval of the Cabinet, and that similarsteps will be taken with regard to Supply. There is also the Far Eastern Council,on which Australia and New Zealand will be represented at the earliest stage&apos;These developments are all to the good. But I suggest that even more is needed.[23364] BCopy No.
If Australia wants, asa -right, to attendee War Cabinet in London, on alloccasions when questions affecting the war, as a.whole, are being discussed, thisright should be granted to her. It is a gesture that would pay us a hundredfold., There is, of course, a condition for which we should have to ask. We shouldbe obliged to make it clear that what was in effect membership of the WarCabinet by ah Australian representative must involve his being given&apos;authorityto take decisions on their behalf, without reference to his Government, in caseswhere a decision had to be reached so urgently that there was no time for him toconsult his Government. This is clearly necessary for the efficient^fcpnduct of&quot;the war and an Australian refusal to delegate authority in such circumstancescould fairly be represented as an embarrassment not only to ourselves but&apos; also tothe other Dominion Governments. , 5f It is, of course, possible that the Commonwealth Government would refusejthis condition. But, if she di d, She&apos; would put herself entirely in the-^i^eng/^^e&quot;should have gone all the way to meet her, and she would have repulsed us. Howmuch better that than the present situation under which we are regarded by widesections of opinion here and abroad as refusing a legitimate claim by one of ourpartners in the Empire. ,    . r . ,, .It may be objected that to concede such a right to Australia means doing the-same for all the other Dominions.   Certainly it does, in principle.   We should&quot;inform the other Dominion Governments of what was being done in the case ofAustralia. It would be for them to decide whether they wanted similar facilities.The system would be in addition to and not in substitution for the present methodsof inter-Governmental consultation, and it is at least doubtful whether they wouldtake advantage of it.   But in my view any risk of unfortunate consequences ofputting these proposals to the Dominions is smaller than the risk of a gradual^disintegration of the Empire.In conclusion, I would emphasise once more to my colleagues the urgent andvital nature of this issue.  It is an issue not merely of machinery, but even moreof status.  On this question of representation have boiled up nearly all the great, crises of opr. history, the long struggles of the Middle Ages which led to thecreation of Parliament, the disputes between the King and Parliament whichiculmjinated in the Civil War, and,, most analogous of all, the conflict with the; American.Goloni.es which led to their separation from the Empire. Such anothercrisis may well be approaching with regard to Imperial relations.   There are,tp-day in the British Empire centrifugal tendencies which no one can ignore.The situation cannot and will not remain as it is. It rests with us to see whetherthe erisis comes to a head, with all the incalculable consequences involved, or is.by wise statesmanship averted;  The issue is immediate.   It cannot be delayed.;I therefore submit these considerations to the urgent attention of the Cabinet.\&apos;y\;&apos;&apos;    -       - &apos;    &quot; &apos; &apos; &apos;     &apos; &apos; &apos;       ,::Q..l^^/^ownw^ Office, January 21, 1912.../,-..:-,-, - &apos;&apos;&quot;-&quot;[:

SydneyBulletin, 7th January, says Churchiirs statement that he &quot;thought it impractic-able to (have Dominion Prime Ministers in London at the same time for too long &quot;^ras an indication of his disinclination.to surrender a jot of his exorbitantpower until surrender is forced on him.&quot; Sydney Morning Herald advocacy ofDominion representations in inner War Councils has the object not only ofsafeguarding Dominion interests, but of relieving Churchill and spreadingresponsibility.

Baume thinks the public are sick to death of suchstatements (&quot;that the planes were sent to Russia and Libya&quot;) &quot;repeated asoften as the B.B.C. bulletin.&quot; London Press criticisms of speech are fullyreported. A.A.P. message in Age on 10th January says &quot;weak andunihformative.&quot; Sydney Morning Herald, 10th January, describes it as&quot;colourless statements .... which reflect very clearly the absence ofChurchill&quot;Duff Cooper.Comment upon recall, which, since its appearance in most newspapers, mustbe regarded as inspired, hails it as another triumph for Curtin. Sydney MorningHerald, 12th January, says the announcement would have been less surprisingif accompanied by some indication of the kind of body which will presumablyreplace the Empire War Council in Singapore.The demand for despatch of responsible Minister on Far East Council (thewindings up of which is forecasted by Sydney Morning Herald correspondent *12th January) is taking second place to the demand for Minister to speak directlyfor the Commonwealth in all inter-Allied discussions wherever they may takeplace (Brisbane Courier, 6th January) and apparently inspired articles appearedin the newspapers of that date pressing for representation on anysAUied Councilappointed to control higher strategy of the.Pacific Campaign [ ? groups omitted]should stick to it.

Most Secret.).1 UNDERSTAND that Curtin has telegraphed to Churchill asking instrong terms for a direct Australian voice in decisions&apos;on the; conduct of the waraffecting Australia. &apos; .&quot; &apos; &apos;2. I am not aware of the precise contentsSbf the message, and ybu willappreciate that it is very difficult for me to function&quot; effectively in regard to amessage of which I have no official knowledge.
3. Curtin&apos;s request is at variance with the personal view expressed by himto me a week ago at an interview referred to in my telegram No. 20 of ;7th January. I believe it to evidence the strong influence wielded by theGovernment left wing in the person of Eyatt and to a lesser extent of Beasley. ,On this issue, they will have secured support from some Opposition Members ofthe War Council, including Spender and very possibly Menzies. Thedeterioration of the Malayan situation naturally strengthens the hands of theadvocates of direct representation.4. Curtin&apos;s request is coincident with the wave of nationalism instigatedby Ministers (probably mainly Evatt), which has established prestige for theGovernment and which finds &quot;strong expression in the Sydney and Melbournepress (see my telegram No. 21 of the 8th January). Curtin&apos;s New Year message,almost certainly concocted by Evatt and two weeks ago doubtfully representativeof Australian opinion, tends increasingly, under the impact of the bad news, tobecome representative.5. It is at any time, and emphatically in the present circumstances, offirst importance to the preservation of Australian ties with the United Kingdomto have regard to Australia^ tender susceptibilities about her nationhood.Further it must, in this connection, be borne in mind that Evatt, as leader of theleft wing group, is in a powerful position and, one may be sure, exercises moreinfluence on Government decisions than any. other of Curtin&apos;s ministers. He isexceedingly ambitious, probably desires to supplant Curtin, has anti-Whitehallprejudice, and would not, I think, hesitate to use highly intensified national-feeling to gain his own ends regardless of what the effect might be on Empireunity. I have reason to believe even now he is, with Beasley, always on thelook-out for an opportunity of playing to improve the position of his own factionagainst Curtin&apos;s.6. It does not appear likely that the news from Malaya will improve somarkedly as to counteract the present rising wave of national feeling which restson the belief that the United Kingdom has in some measure failed Australia,and on which the Government^ popularity has, to some extent, been made to rest.7. This feeling is likely to continue at least so long as news is bad. IfAustralia suffers acutely in this struggle she will blame Britain the more and apermanent weakening of Australian ties with the United Kingdom may wellresult.8. The question whether some extraordinary step should be taken to meetCurtin&apos;s request for representation should be viewed against the abovebackground.9. It should also be borne in mind that the question is being widelycanvassed in the press (I should expect at Evatfs instigation), and that thedemand is interwoven with Australian national dignity and feeling that themovement of the centre of gravity of the war towards the East has givenAustralia an urgent and increasing claim to a direct voice in the higher strategyof the war.
