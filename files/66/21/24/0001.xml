(THIS. DCCtMENT. IS THE PROPERTY. OF HIS BRmNMC. MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET^P..:(42).JA.&apos; W   PYJNa29-TH JiiNTJARY, 19*1-2.   -EE ..CABPJETTHE COMMITTEE ON SKILLED MEN IN THE SERVICES y V(THE BEVERIDGE COMMITTEE)Memorandum by the Secretary of State for YvarThe Minister of. Labour and National Service&quot; has circulated to theWar Cabinet the Second Report (part i) of Sir William Beveridge&apos;s Committeeon Skilled Men in the Services and asks for a decision on the question ofits publication.      The First or Interim Report of the Committee was renderedin August and has already &quot;been published (.Cod. 6307)j   in brief, so far asthe Army and the Royal Air Force were concerned, that Report said(a) &quot;The work of repair, maintenance, etc. of machines of war.... is now being perf omod both in the Army and in the AirForce with a notable economy of skilled men, secured by ahigh degree of dilution and extensive t?.nd well-designedarrangements for training.&quot;   -(b) &quot;Vigorous efforts are being made by those Services todiscover men already in the Forces not already engaged on suchwork whose qualifications make it likely they could undertake. it with success or could be trained to do so. 11(c) &quot;In view of the military programmes, a.large increase of menengaged on such work is inevitable, exceeding, the numbers whocan be obtained within the Services by training or transfer, &quot;It may be asked why the favourable verdic t quoted above from theFirst Report was reversed in most respects by the Second Report receivedtowards the end of October,   ... The ostensible reason was that in the meantimethe Beveridge Committee had interviewed 139 men in the Army, from amongnames furnished by employers and trade unions, who were alleged to be skilledmen whom the-Army was either misusing or not using at all as such.     On thisI would offer two&apos;: comments.     In the first place, 139 cases do not afford avery broad foundation on which to base a general condemnation of the use ofskilled men by the Army and an argument that all the skill the Army requirescan be found (with a minor exception) from within its own resources alreadyin the Service.      In the second place, the Beveridge Committee interviewedthese 139 raen without knowing their &quot;trade history&quot; since joining the Armyor the operational role of their units;    the War Office have gone throughthe.same 139 cases in the light of the completer knowledge in theirpossession, and after trader-testing doubtful cases, have reduced by 50^ theproportion of &quot;misfits&quot; stated by the Committee to exist among the 139 casesexamined by them.-I have thought it well to circulate to my colleagues a detailedcommentary on the strictures upon the Army&apos;s use of its skilled men containedin the Second Report of the Bevoridge Committee.     It is a long document,,   1and/
and I therefore preface it with a short statement of the-main points,,cross-referenced to the full memorandum.   , If the, War Cabinet decidethat the Second Report: of the Beveridge Committee should- be publishedI would invite the::&apos;&apos; to approve publication also of both the memorandaattached to this -paper;   the shorter one will cover most of the groundfor the purposes of the Press;    the longer memorandum contains areasoned statement of what is, I submit, a strong case for&apos;the Army torecruit the ranks of its skilled personnel from industry to a much,greater extent than the Beveridge Corxiittee were willing to concede.The War Office,29th January, 19^-2.D.M.
(This Summary should be read in conjunction with the moredetailed. Memorandum annexed, to which, it is - cross-ref er(enced),The Second Report of the Beveridge,Committee expresses the view(Paragraph l)   that in the Army:-:(a) Skilled manpower is not yet being used withdue economy and effect and substantial?changes of, organisation and machinery arenecessary...(b) Subject to minor improvements, Army arrangementsfor training skilled men are adequate, but as theyhave largely had to be improvised they need closerintegration with Army organisations as a whole,together with a better selection of trainees.(c) There is a clear possibility that the. Army&apos;srequirements- in tradesmen can be met from withinthe Army itself, apart from a certain number of.highly skilled men needed as armament artificers.During the last eight months a detailed scrutiny of the(Paragraph 9,   whole manpower resources of the Army has been undertaken by thepage 4)      War Office with the purpose of relating the forces available tothe operational requirements of the theatres of war and at thesame time of economising manpower and of substituting women formen, where possible.Recognising the room for improvement in the posting arrangements(Paragraph 13) of men with skilled qualifications, the War Office, before theBeveridge Committee was set up, had already experimented with atrial system.of intake for General Service with a view to testingpossibilities and measuring difficulties.      Thus., a training centrehas been set up in Scotland, the intake into which will be enlistedfor General Service, but where recruits will be retained for theperiod of their basic training, during which they will undergoselection tests with a view to finding out the arm, corps andemployment in the Army for which they are most suited.    . If it is; found practicable, the War Office will introduce enlistment for theArmy instead of for corps.     Meanwhile improved methods of selection(Paragraph ll) and posting, such as the experiment in Scotland, are being applied toArmy intakes of men,- and a lieutenantrcolonel with the necessarytechnical knowledge has been appointed to&quot; the staff of each Commandto advise oh and to supervise the subject of trade testing andtechnical training in the Army.     In addition, the staff forinspecting and supervising the various trade training establishmentsis being strengthened.The question as to whether all mechanical maintenance in the(Paragraph 12) Army should be concentrated in one corps is being considered by aCommittee of three senior members of tho War Office staff who are ofhigh standing and long experience in the business world.     Their reportwill be considered in the light of practical considerations., Two further measures have been introduced to reduce the number(Paragraph 9,    of &quot;misfits&quot; in the Army and to economise skilled manpower.     In the- page 5)      first place, Tradesmen&apos;s Interview Boards have been set up in eachCorrimand to interview all skilled men, actual or potential, and tosecure that they are appropriately graded and employed in the Army,or where necessary given further skilled training.    In particular,these/

these Boards will, look into the cases of men whose names are beingsupplied to the War Office by employers and trade unions, throughthe Beveridge Committee.     Secondly,. a strong Committee has been setup with the purpose of reviewing Army establishments:   the. numbers ofskilled men employed mil be reduced to a minimum, semi-skilled menwill be substituted for skilled where possible, and the resourcesof highly-skilled men will be pooled among corps and units so faras is practicable.     In both these activities, representatives ofthe Ministry of Labour will be associated.Such are some of the steps the War Office is taking as a resultof its recognition of the value of the constructive criticism containedin.the Second Report of the Beveridge Committee.In considering the Report&apos;s criticisms, however, it should beremembered that since the Army is likely to be more .fully engaged inoverseas operations in the/near future, the Report (framed last summer)is already&quot;dated&quot;.     It was addressed mainly to conditions in whichArmy units and establishments operated&quot;at home.     Furthermore, theCommittee, composed as it is, has naturally applied to the questionsunder review the standards.of civil industry;   whereas the Army isfirst and foremost a fighting machine and must be organised to thebest advantage as such.     Operational requirements impose limitationson the most economical use of skilled manpower in the Army -judgingby the standards of industrial;organisation.     The. Army problem oforganising maintenance is far more difficult than that of the Navyand R.A0F. who normally operate from organised bases.      &quot;Echeloned&quot;service is imposed on the Army by the conditions, of land warfare - thusskilled tradesmen must be distributed in small units to most forwardfighting formations from the rear maintenance workshops.     Thisecheloned chain of repair and maintenance inevitably use up moretradesmen than concentrated Base Workshop organisations.      The campaignin Libya is a striking proof of this,A main fault found by the Committee is that the Army allows toomany.skilled men to stand by unused at any one time.     Though it isadmitted that&apos;there may be room for slight improvement (which will bemade), the Report of the Committee itself answers its own objectionin paragraph 31:-   &quot;War in certain phases involves standing by to actrather than acting; in war, engineers like others must be kept waitingeither not fully occupied or occupied otherwise than as engineers, butready to use their skill in emergencies at a moment&apos;s notice.     Wecertainly do hot reject a claim to hold power in reserve for emergencies.The Beveridge Committee examined 139 serving soldiers and placed36 of these men in Category Vl(a) as men who though in Service tradessuited to their civilian skill, had. not been working at those trades toany substantial extent; &apos; and 38 men in Category Vl(b) as men notmustered in a Service trade or wrongly mustered.     The Committee didnot have before them these men&apos;s &quot;trade histories&quot; since joining theArmy and they did not relate their employment at the time of theinterviews, to the operational background of their units.      The YferOffice, re-examining each individual case in the light of theirknowledge on these points, reduced the numbers of men to l6 inCategory Vl(a) and 20 in Vl(b), a reduction of about $Ofo.     Onthe other hand, in Category 1(a), composed of men making full useof their civilian skill in.a Service trade, the War Office included,      *as a result of fuller information, k-9 men as against 13 so allocatedby the Committee.     It does not seem that an investigation of 139cases (in yvhich, in fact, lack of information was responsible for a5Q$ inaccurate assessment of &quot;misfits&quot;)is a sufficient body of evidenceon which to base -&quot;the adverse judgment of the Army&apos;s use of its skilledpersonnel given by the Committee.In effect, the argument that the Army has had two years in whichto segregate its skilled men is invalid, since until the Russiancampaign has momentarily reduced the threats of invasion, the Armyhas/

has never &quot;been more-than a dangerously slender fighting force,every member of which has to be a trained fighting soldier ifinvasion is to be repelled . -   Even to-day, when a potentialtradesman is taken from the ranks of fighting units tc be trainedas such, he must be replaced by a fighting soldier who requiresbetween 6 and 8 months&apos; training before he is fitted for his placein a fighting unit.     The fighting soldier himself, in these daysof complicated weapons, is no mere intelligent&apos;unskilled man, butmust be a highly trained &quot;tradesman&quot; in the use of his weapons.Nevertheless over 80,000 men, before the Beveridge Committee wasset up, had beenrc-allocated to employment appropriate to theirskill, while since the outbreak of war 58,000 highly skilledpersonnel, officers and men, had been released from the Army forwork of national importance.

:iS.iORANDtH Bt THE WAR OFFICE Oft THE SECOND REPORTOF SIR.WILLIAM BEVERIEGE&apos;S COMMITTEE ON SKILLEDMEN IN THE SERVICES.1. The Committee under Sir William Beveridge, set up &quot;by theMinister of Labour and National Service.:.in June last, were asked&quot;to advise, in the light of the. operational and maintenance requirementsof the three Services&quot; whether :-(a) the skilled manpower in the Services was &quot;being usedeconomically and effectively;(b) whether the Services&apos; arrangements for training skilledmen were adequate;   and(c) whether the Services&apos; demands for skilled tradesmen forthe period ending 31st March, 1942, should bemodified.So far as the Army is concerned, the Committee answered thesethree questions as follows:      (a)     skilled manpower is not yet. being used with due economyand effect, and substantial changes of organisationand machinery are necessary;...(b) subject to minor improvements Army arrangements for  .training skilled men are adequate, but as they havelargely, had to be improvised they need closerintegration with Army organisation as a whole,together-with a better selection of trainees;(c) there is a clear possibility that the Army^ requirementsin tradesmen can be met from within the Army itself,apart from a certain number of highly skilled menneeded as armament artificers. -2. The Beveridge Committee have carried out a valuable survey ofskilled manpower in the Array-.     Composed of members with wideexperience of industry, and containing representatives of both theemployers and the Trade Unions&apos; interest, they have perhaps naturallyapplied to the questions under their review the standards of civilindustry.     But the Army cannot be fitted entirely into the mould ofcivil industry;   it is first and foremost a fighting machine and must beorganised to the best advantage as such..    Operational requirementsimpose in many ways restrictions and limitations on the most economicaluse of skilled manpower in the Army, judged by the standards of a wellconducted industrial establishment,;   and in the last resort the successor failure of the Army organisation of its resources in skilled manpower&apos;must turn on the Army1s efficiency as a fighting machine.The Committee themselves (Para. 55-of their Second Report) putthe matter in a nutshell when they say&quot;The first priority in war is for whatever is needed tokeep the machines of war in action. -. Breakdown of amachine of war in action means more than the loss ofthat particular machine;   it means as a rule the lossof/

of the fighting men;    it may mean the loss: of aa battle ..,.     It is not sufficient to produce themachines of war;   they must be maintained continuouslyin action under all conditions.&quot;The conditions of land warfare do not allow of the organisationof the maintenance of Army vehicles, equipment, etc.,, on the basis ofelaborate central workshops:   armoured fighting vehicles, guns, etc., haveto be repaired under conditions of actual warfare as hear as possible tothe front;   all. warlike stores must be kept effective, for action as longas possible, and only vtiien major repair or overhaul is required can the.Army-afford to bring the-equipment back to a. central base: workshop fortreatment.     In this respect .the Army problem is different from and farmore difficult than that of the Navy and the .R.A.F., who normally operatefrom elaborately organised bases;   &quot;echeloned service&quot; is imposed on theArmy by these conditions, of land warfare, i. e. skilled tradesmen must. .oedistributed .in small units right up to the most forward fighting formations,as well as with the rearward maintenance&apos; workshops.     This echeloned chainof repair and maintenance inevitably uses up more tradesmen than aconcentrated base workshop organisation;   the present campaign in Libya,even more than its forerunner a year ago, .has pointed the moral of this forthe Army in no uncertain terms, and it is not going too far to say that the-success achieved by General Auchlnleck&apos;s forces has been very largely due tothe rapid repair and replacement&apos; in the fighting line of armoured fightingvehicles temporarily knocked out in battle. . . This is one of the outstandinglessons we have, learned from our enemies;   we may hope that-we haveimproved upon it in the process.    &quot;It has been necessary to set out thisoperational background to the &apos;Army use of its skilled men since theBeveridge Committee do not appear to have paid sufficient regard to thisall-important factor, although their terms of reference, as mentioned above,drew special attention to it.3. One of the main faults which the Committee find with the Armyorganisation of its skilled men is that there is too much skill &quot;standingby&quot; unused in the Army at any one time, and that better use.could be made ofskilled men who, for various reasons, are not fully exercising. their skill.  .While some improvement (as is mentioned later) can and will be made&apos;inthis respect, the Committee have again paid insufficient regard to theoperational reasons responsible for this result,     In this matter, too, theCommittee have themselves (paragraph 31) put the point very clearly&quot;war in certain phases involves standing by to act rather thanacting;   in war, engineers, like others, must be kept waitingeither not fully occupied or occupied otherwise than asengineers, but ready to use their skill in emergencies at a- moment&apos;s notice.     We certainly do not reject a claim to holdpower in reserve for emergencies&quot;.It is a clear deduction from the Committee&apos;s statement justquoted that men who, by reason of the Army&apos;s commitments3 are &quot;standing,by to act&quot; should not be counted as &quot;misfits&quot; in the Army organisation.This particularly applies to Royal Engineer units, who contain a higherproportion of such men than other corps which have a more static role inwar.The Royal Engineer unit engaged in field operations must have atits disposal skilled men competent to tackle many varied forms of skilledwork at short notice in an emergency., when there is no time,, vfithout holdingup operations, to summon skilled men from the resources of a central pool;the Beveridge Committee confined their.enquiries to Engineer units under theprevailing conditions in this- country, but if-they had reviev/ed the work ofRoyal Engineer units under war conditions in the Middle East, for example, itis safe to say that a very different picture would have emerged.     Further,the conditions of an invasion of this country would call into full use thatoperational organisation of. Royal Engineer units which, while presentconditions continue at home, may in some ways appear wasteful of skilledMen;   and it must be remembered that if invasion happens, the Army will begranted no margin of tSme in which to repair deficiencies of organisation.w

4. Again, the&apos;Array oannot escape holding pools of tradesmen to* meetwastage in the many overseas theatres of war.   The problem of employingthese to the fullest advantage while they are waiting&quot;despatch is adifficult one, for.the sailing arrangements of troopships and their convoyspreclude such long term planning as would enable these waiting men to be. atthe lathe until the last moment before embarkation.   But the War Officeare doing what is possible by decentralising the arrangements for the use ofsuch waiting men to Commands at home;   better results are probable from suchlocal arrangements, particularly as local solutions of accommodationdifficulties (a big factor in this connection) can usually, be arrived atmore quickly.5. The generally adverse verdict returned by the Beveridge Committeeto the question whether the Ansy makes full use of its skilled men isbased on personal interviews which the Committee held with 139 servingsoldiers, whose names were selected in roughly equal numbers from listsfurnished by employers and trade unions, with one or two from other sources.The Committee have classified these men in the various categories set out inAppendix A of.their Report;. these categories are not repeated here, butrelate to the degree to which the Army is. using their skill in their present&quot;employment.    The gravamen of the charge made by the Beveridge Committeelies in the -large proportion of the 139 men whom they placed in category VI,which they divided into two sub-divisions:-(a) men who though mustered in a Service trade suitedto their civilian skill have not been working, at thattrade to any substantial extent, and(b) men not mustered in a Service trade or wrongly mustered.The Committee placed respectively 36 and 38 men in categories Vl(a) and Vl(b);but they did not have before them the man&apos;s &quot;trade history&quot; since he joinedthe Army, and they did not relate his employment at the time of the inter-view to the operational background of his unit.   In two different ways theoperational&apos;role of the unit directly affects the conditions of the skilledman&apos;s employment:   his unit may (unknown to him) be earmarked for earlydespatch overseas, or again it may be allotted to a vital operational role inthe defence of this country.   In either case, the point is that there mustinevitably be some proportion of the skilled men of a unit who are &quot;standingby to act&quot; and are not fully and continuously employed at their&apos; skilledtrade.   The War Office have re-examined each individual case, and indoing so have taken account both of the factors.just mentioned, which werenot known to the Beveridge Committee when they interviewed, the men, and.also of the result of subsequent trade-testing of the men - where this wasnecessary for correct classification.    In the result, it is found thatonly 16 and 20 men respectively should be classified in categories Vl(a)and Vl(b) - a reduction of some 50 per cent.   On the other hand category l(a),to which the Committee assigned those men already in a Service1 trade andmaking full use of their civilian skill in that trade; includes 1+9- men asreviewed by the War Office in the light of fuller information, as against 13so allocated by the Committee.   The small number of cases of alleged misuseof skill in the Army enquired into by the Committee was, in any case, perhapsa slender foundation to carry the far-reaching conclusions based upon it, andin view of the careful check-up of, each case by the Amy Authorities, itseems possible&quot;1 that more exhaustive examination would have led the Committeeinto placing a very much higher percentage of the men examined into categoriesdenoting that their skill was being reasonably used.6,        ,   The original request placed before the. Beveridge Committee onbehalf of the Army was for a small number of highly skilled men, of thearmament artificer type.   Following representations by Sir WilliamBeveridge, at a subsequent conference, as to the extent of dilution ofskilled men in the Army, the numbers asked for were raised considerably.As a result of further discussions following the issue of this Second Reportof the Committee, the-War Office have reverted to the&apos; original request for asmall number of highly skilled men only.   War is not static, and as theArmy becomes.involved in operations in other theatres of. war, and as armouredformations take an increasing part&quot; in these operations, the demand for1skilled men for repair and maintenance work will inevitably increase.

7. In the foregoing paragraphs it is suggested that the BeveridgeCommittee have failed to give due weight to the operational and maintenancecommitments of an Army organised as an efficient fighting machine, andfurther, that in investigating the 139 cases, on the results of which theCommittee primarily &quot;based their adverse judgement on the Army&apos;s use of itsskilled personnel, the Committee lacked information on certain importantaspects which might well have resulted in reducing the assessed &quot;misfits&quot;by at least; 50 per cent.     The Beveridge Committee have neverthelessperformed a most useful piece of work in pointing to weak places in theArmy system of using its skilled men, and the Committee&quot;s recommendationsand suggestions are in all instances being followed up and implemented asrapidly.as possible, having regard to those overriding considerations ofmilitary efficiency mentioned above.     The more important of theserecommendations, and the action which is being taken on them are set outbelow.     (References are to paragraphs of the Second Report).8.   Review of Amy Establishments,   (paragraphs ,31 to 33.)The Committee have suggested such a review with the dual aim ofreducing the number of tradesmen in a particular establishment and also ofsubstituting semi-skilled for skilled men where possible.     The Committeealso consider that this review should take account of the possibility ofeconomising men of rare skill by pooling resources between different cdrpsand Units.     Such a review should produce useful results and the Y/ar Officehave appointed a committee to-undertake the task;    this committee has beeninstructed to lay down the broad lines of policy to be applied to all unitestablishments embodying tradesmen;    the detailed work of examining the verylarge number of unit establishments affected, in order to translate thispolicy into terms of ranks and trades in each unit, is boxing pursued by anappropriate sub-committee which will co-opt the necessary technical expertsfor the particular arms under examination.9.   Scrutiny of Army man-power with a view to employing all skilled men onskilled tasks (paragraphs 16, 39, 40? 41 and 62 of the Report arerelevant).Much has already been done in the direction indicated by theBeveridge Report,     In the course of the last eight months a detailedscrutiny of the whole man-power resources of the Army has been undertakenin order to relate the forces available to the operational requirements ofeach several theatre of war,     and this large-scale review has been under-taken from the prime standpoint of economising -man-power and(incidentally) of substituting women for men -whore possible.     The reviewwas not intended, of course, to go into the details of the internal make-upof the personnel of units and the. appropriate numbers of skilled menemployed;   but it will have ensured that the numbers of units required forthe operational commitments of the Army are no more than are.absolutelynecessary.In the course of that review, many new units using tradesmen havebeen, and are still being formed, especially R.A.0.0. units:,   thus there areat times small surpluses in a trade, required for these newly-formed unitsand soon absorbed by them.     Such surpluses are attached, pending absorption,to existing units where accommodation exists;   any form of &quot;holding&quot; unitsfor such men would waste man-power in &quot;overheads&quot;.The Beveridge Committee have arranged to furnish the War Off icewith lists of skilled men now serving, received from employers and tradeunions, where a man1 s &quot;skill is said not to be effectively used (paragraph 16).The Committee have suggested that the machinery for finding and selectingmen for Service trades should be strengthened and should make use ofpersonal interviews by experts rather than examination of paper records(paragraph 40).   Again, they suggest that too often laymen in the Army havebeen asked to do the job of an expert engineer in this connection(paragraph 41)-   Where enquiry reveals that a man&apos;s skill is not beingfully employed in his present post, they suggest that the many barriersoperating against their free transfer to posts inhere their skill can bebetter employed should be removed.A word may be said on this last question. It must be remembered thatthe Army of today is made up of varied elements:    the pre-war TerritorialArmy/

Army in which?- except for specialist units,, no attempt was normally madeto fit a man&apos;s skill in his civil trade into similar skilled work in the-Array;   the militia influx just &quot;before the war, to which broadly speaking asimilar remark applies;   and the huge intake of men which the Army hadperforce to take in the period immediately after Dunkirk, who had to beformed into units and organised and trained to meet a dire and ijmiinentperil of invasion, a process which clearly precluded the possibility ofcarefully placing square pegs into square holes a &apos;   Further, the second-lineTerritorial units raised when the Territorial Army was doubled, before theWar, comprised many units, raised, on the invitation of the &quot;War Office^ bylarge public utility undertakings and big business&apos; firms, etc., and it vra.simplicit in the oonditions of their formation that the men of these unitsshould continue to serve together.     So far as skilled men were concerned,before the Beveridge Committee was set; up, the - Army had tried hard toovertake these accumulated handicaps and had, in fact, oombed out upwards of80,000 men who. have been re-allocated to employment appropriate to theirskill.    In individual cases, a higher N.0.0. rank&apos;which a man has acquiredis a bar to his placing in a tradesmen&apos;s post in the lowest rank;   but thisbar is not absolute.     Further, in individual cases the Army may lose morein its fighting efficiency by displacing a man who is a key man in afighting sub-unit than it would gain by putting that man into a tradesmen&apos;sjobs   it is clearly not expedient in-exceptional cases to apply the acceptedprinciple blindly without regard to the effect on fighting units *Two other points should be mentioned.    Every potential tradesmanwithdrawn from,the ranks of fighting units for the purpose of being trainedmust be replaced.in that unit by a trained fighting soldiers     It, is hotsufficiently appreciated that it takes, on the average, between six and eightmonths to train a fighting soldier*-. - This factor should be considered aobeing&apos; one of the necessary brakes upon the wholesale withdrawal of trainedsoldiers from, units for long courses of specialised trade training.     Theother point to be borne in mind is this.     It may be urged that the Army has .had over two years in which to put its house in order as to making the bestuse of its skilled men.    This is quite wrong.     The army was not in aposition to tamper in any way with its dangerously slender fighting,resources until the imminent risk of invasion, which persisted from June,194-0, had somewhat receded with the outbreak of the Russian war in June,1941*    The intricate and large scale administrative arrangements, coupledwith the increase in non-fighting overheads, which are necessary for. thebig ta.sk of selecting and training many thousands of potential trainees, couldnot be put into full effect until quite recently.     This v/as the main reasonwhy the Army accepted Sir William Beveridge&apos;s invitation to increase itsdemand for tradesmen.     If these could have been found from civil life itwould have suited the.Army better as, apart from avoiding the administrativeconfusion caused by re-training its own men, it would have avoided the wasteof purely military training which had been given to the potential tradesmenalready in the Army.It must not be overlooked that 58,000 officers and men have beenreleased from the Army since the outbreak of war for work of nationalimportance,. and the bulk of these were highly skilled personnel in variouswalks of life.With these reservations, there is, however, an admitted need forimproving the machinery for dealing with those cases of &quot;misfit&quot; tradesmenwhich are brought to notice.     The War Office are setting up TradesmetiVsInterview Boards in each Command which will interview all such cases fallingwithin the particular Command..     Each man1 s trade mustering *in the Army willbe scrutinised in relation to his skilled trade and qualifications in civillife;   and where - it is expedient his trade classification will be upgraded,or if necessary he will be transferred to more suitable employment inanother unit. &apos;. . .These enquiries will in the first instance be oonfined to men ofengineering and electrical trades.These/

* 6 1These Boards will have a permanent president-, a representative ofthe Ministry of Labour and representatives of the arms of the Servicesimmediately concerned, ted they will pay special attention to sicillod men ,whose trade in civil life.is &quot;single purpose11.    The report of theinterview and any necessary trade test which follows it will be made directby the Board and Testing Centre respectively to the War Office, and^thepersonnel will then be considered for re-posting, transfer or return tocivil life as may be expedient0This procedure has been agreed with Sir William Beveridge* and aspecial branch is being set up under the Adjutant-General to dealexpeditiously with-this work.       &apos;lCu   Improvement of Posting Arrangements^.    (Paragraph 36.)iThere is admittedly room for improvement here9     Attainment of theideal whereby every man with skilled qualifications is placed, on enteringthe Army, where ho is most wanted is largely bound up with the alterationin the system of enlistment referred to in paragraph 43 of the Report andcommented on separately below (paragraph 13)*    Pending the major changethere adumbrated, improved methods of selection and posting have beenintroduced by the War Office to make the most of the existing Army trainingcentre organisation.11.   Improvement of Trade Testing.    &quot;-(Paragraph 3?*),Improvement of Technical Training7&apos; - (Paragraph 38?)The Beveridge Committee have given some useful advice, forimproving trade testing and technical training in the Army, and theirsuggestions will be adopted so far as they are compatible with theoperational-considerations which must govern the organisation of the Armyas a fighting machine.     The vt&quot;ar Office consider that the necessarytechnical^ advice should be readily available to higher commanders andstaffs and to unit commanders * , They ore therefore appointing at once a-lieutenant-colonel with the necessary technical knowledge to the staff ofeach Command to give such technical jxdyice and to supervise technicaltraining and trade testing.     In addition, the staff for inspecting and -supervising the various trade training establishments is being strengthened.Incidentally, the Committee in their Report (paragraph 37) mentionrepresentations made to them that, tests, fair in themselves, have sometimesbeen made unfair by failure on the part of the Army to -provide suitabletools at its trade testing centres *     The specific complaints made to theCommittee have subsequently been investigated by a joint enquiry of theBeveridge Committee and of the War Office, and have been shown to beentirely devoid of foundation.12.   A cprps of Mechanical Engineers..     (Paragraph 44*)The.increasing mechanisation, of the Army has forced to the frontthe question whether all mechanical maintenance should not be&quot; concentratedin one corps.     This is a problem which was explored more than once inpeacetime, but is one of increasing urgency In an Army where armoureddivisions are assuming an ever larger role.   It is, however, necessary tobear in mind whether the major changes in army organisation which would beinvolved by, inter alia.the concentration of the mechanical maintenanceduties of all existing corps in one corps, can be undertaken in the&apos;middleof a war.     Further, the fact that large parts of the British Army areengaged in active operations overseas renders the concentration of allmechanical maintenance duties into one Corps a matter of great difficulty.That is a matter of high policy to be decided on the highest level.     In themeantime, the pros and cans of the question have been remitted &quot;to acommittee of three senior members of the &quot;War Office staff who are themselvesof high standing and long experience in the business world.     Their report,,which will shortly be made, will have to be considered in the light of thepractical considerations just mentioned*

13.   Enlistment for the Army instead of for a Corps.    (Paragraph 1+3*)Here again the Army inherits a system which it would he glad tochange.   The present system of enlistment for Corps is, however, one of themajor features of the pre-war Army organisation and is based upon feelings oflocal sentiment and tradition about which counties and towns are at leastas jealous as the regiments of the Army concerned.   The present system isbuilt up upon a framework of regimental Record Offices and Pay Offices, withramifications through every aspect of Army administration.   A radical andsweeping change in this system would involve a large measure of immediatedislocation and inconvenience and would give rise to legal difficulties.To attempt such a change at the present juncture might bo very dangerous.Nevertheless, far from adopting a negative attitude to this proposal, theWar Office had it under close examination for many months before theBeveridge Committee was set up, and has already introduced an experimentalsystem of intake for general service with a view to testing the possibilitiesand measuring the difficulties.   For example, there has been set up in Scotlanda training centre, the intake into which will be enlisted for. general service.Recruits will be retained at the centre for the period of their, basic training,and during that period they will undergo selection tests with a view to findingout the arm, corps and employment -in the Army for which they are most suited.If it is found to be practicable, on administrative and other grounds, the WarOffice will introduce enlistment for. the Army instead of for Corps.    In themeantime, improved methods of selection and posting, as mentioned above,&apos; arebeing applied to Army intakes&apos;of men.14. The review of the Arnr^s. organisation of its skilled tradesmenundertaken by the Beveridge Committee -. a body of experts with a detailedknowledge of the organisation of technical skill in civil industry - wouldalmost inevitably bring to its task the standards Of industrial practice.A Committee so constituted could, not be expected to appreciate the extent towhich the ideal organisation has to be subordinated to serve the ends ofoperational efficiency.   In this Paper the War. Office have endeavoured tosupply the necessary corrective from the military standpoint. . This is notto say that the Beveridge Committee have not performed a most useful task,and the very fact that they have thrown up in sharp relief those ways inwhich the Army organisation is wrongly conceived or uneconomical of skilledpersonnel has made it incumbent on the War Office to examine the BeveridgeConjmittee&apos;s recommendations and suggestions the more closely, in order toshow cause why military exigencies in some cases preclude their implementation.It is therefore in no &quot;sense of carping criticism that the remarks in thisPaper are made and the War Office desire to record their appreciation of thevery valuable survey of skilled man-power in the Army which the Committeehave completed, end which will, it is,hoped, help to achieve that balancedcompromise between operational needs and economy of skilled personnelwhich will produce the most efficient fighting machine.
