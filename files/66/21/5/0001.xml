THIS DOCUMENT. IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;&apos; Sv GOVERNMENT),SECRET.W.P. (48) 25,goIy NQ0  /.7TE JANUARY? 194 2oWAR CABINETeCONSIDERATION FOR LEASE-LEND AID.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer^1*        As at present drafted Article VII of the proposed.Agreement involves a   declaration on our part that weshall work towards the eventual abolition of Imperial&apos;Preference..    In my view, to commit ourselves now to sucha declaration, however much it is qualified &quot;by safeguardsregarding the time or manner in which the object is to becarried out, would cause acute political controversy bothin this country and in the. Dominions,,    It may well be thatcertain of the Dominion Governments might be prepared, atthis juncture, to agree to a declaration that the abolitionof Imperial Preference is to be an ultimate aimj   but thiswould not, in my view, dispose of the danger of politicalcontroversy within the Dominions^   As regards this country,I feel sure that the danger is a reality and that a largesection of the House of Commons and of public opinion inthis country would be acutely critical of us if we signedthe proposed declaration..2n        The- only way of avoiding the danger of politicaltrouble on this point arising out. of Article VII would be-tio secure the omission oi&apos; Imperial preference from the listof forms of discrimination..    In this connection I may saythat there is reason to believe that the United StatesAdministration, apart from the State Department, are notdisposed to attach first importance to the abolition ofImperial Preference^   For example, no difficulty arose withthe President on this point in connection with the AtlanticDeclaration,.30.        In addition to the political issue, I think it isimportant to realise the practical value of ImperialPreference to us in the economic field,    i stress thisaspect because the proper balancing of our external trademay well prove to be one of our most formidable post-warproblems..4c        By committing ourselves to the eventual eliminationof Imperial Preference., we should in effect renounce theonly effective instrument that is available for promotingthe development of inter-Imperial trade and strengtheningthe economic ties between different parts of the Empire.I think that this would be dangerous from several pointsof viewo

5o In the first place, there is the standpoint ofBritish export trade,.    In 1938, United Kingdom exports toEmpire Markets amounted to  234 millions,  or praoticallyone-half the total figure of  470 millions of exports toall markets.    The greater part of our exports to foreignmarkets went *to. Europe, and were thus liable to be, as*they have been, cut off by war^.   Our exports to the UnitedStates in 1938 were only  SO millionso6* After the war, the large decline that must beexpected in our &quot;invisible export5&apos; receipts, will makeit necessary for us to secure a large expansion in ourtotal exports, in order to pay for the food and materialsthat we must obtain from overseas.-,    Our need to import ona large scale from the outside world is clear andimperative.,    It is not so clear that the outside worldneeds to buy on a large scale from uso    The semi-monopolyposition as a manufacturing country which.we enjoyed forso long in the last century, has now completely passedaway?    and there is virtually nothing thaV we have tooffer which cannot nowadays be obtained from many othercountries, some of them as efficient technically asourselves, some With, lower wage and labour standards, andsome with special competitive advantages,  such as thatwhich its vast home market gives to the United States for -mass product!ona7o How we should fare in these circumstances if we were* exposed after the war to unrestricted world competition inevery export market is an entirely uncertain matter^    Butin the absence of any knowledge as to what the conditionsof world competition are likely to be, this prospect mustbe regarded as an extremely hazardous one0    By adoptingthe principle of non^disorimination we should haveprecluded ourselves from making any conditions requiringthose from whom we bought to buy from us in re turn;    and Ican see no assurance under these conditions that our balanceof;payments might not become increasingly adverse, until apoint were reached at which it would be impossible toprotect sterling against a catastrophic collapses    On theother hand the retention of the favoured position which ourindustries enjoy in Empire markets would sup-ply an elementof stabilityQ    If we could regard half our pre-war exportmarkets as reasonably, well secured, we should have firmfoundations upon which to buildo    In the pre-war decade?Empire&quot; preferences were of great value to our hard-pressedexporting industries, notably the cotton industry0    In thepost-war period they may be indispensable, to therestoration of our national economyo8c Tt is no answer to this objection to point out thatwe are only asked to promise the &quot;eventual&quot; abolition ofImperial Preference, in return, moreover, for a reductionin the United States tariff as a quid._p.ro j3uo*.    Our needfor preferential aid for export marke&quot;ts&apos; is likely to be-2-

strongest, i*ot in the early post-war period, when&quot;sellers1 markets&quot; will prevail, hut later on, whenthe industries of belligerent countries have beenrestored to peace-time activities.    The advantagesof a reduction in the united States tariff wouldaccrue to competing countries as well as to ourselves;and a reduction that was large enough to cause acuteinternal controversy in the United States might failto stimulate our exports by more than a small fractionof what we should lose by a withdrawal of preferencein Empire markets.9*        The system of Imperial Preference is of greatvaluer not only to ourselves, but to many of thecolonies f01* whose welfare we are responsible.    Itis not too much to say that  he economic life of mostof our West Indian colonies/ of Mauritius and Fiji,is entirely dependent on the sugar preferences, whilethe East African coffee and sisal industries are alsodependent on the preferential system.   At a time whenpublic opinion is increasingly recognizing ourresponsibility for the welfare.of colonial peoples,it would not be easy to justify an under talcing whichwould spell ruin for many of theme10a       The next consideration to which it is importantto pay regard is the influence that close economicties may exert in promoting the political solidarityof the Empires    To assume that political associationsshould play no part in determining the channels oftrade is to beg a large and controversial questionsSo long as any danger of major wars remains, it isclear that it is &quot;better for us to depend on our Empiremarkets and sources of supply than on European marketsand sources from which we are liable to be cut off*But apart from this, it is arguable that the maintenanceof the Commonwealth as a political entity which mayhave an important constructive role to play inpromoting the peace and security of the world dependsill no small degree on the development of the intimatemutual intercourse which springs from trade relations^11.       In this connection, it seems to me pertinent toobserve that the sharp  distinction which the UnitedStates Administration is inclined to draw betweentariffs (which it is hoped to reduce) and preferences(which are to be eliminated) does not take due accountof the peculiar^ informal structure of the BritishCommonwealth.   The United States has evolved as afederation of different   States, maintaining completeFree Trade between one another, and a high tariffagainst the outside world.    The political structureof the British Commonwealth is far looserj    and

it is appropriate that the economic ties should hecorrespondingly looser, but it does not follow that it iswrong that there should be economic ties at all.&apos;-   On thecontrary, it would clearly be anomalous and unjust, if theUnited States were to continue to accord what are, in...........-&quot;effect, extremely high preferences to the sugar of PortoRico (on the ground that it forms an integral part of theUnited States), while we were forbidden in the name of non-discrimination to grant more moderate preferences to thesugar of Jamaica and Barbados..IS. It is possible that many of the smaller states ofEurope may seek after the war to obtain greater securityby joining together in some loose political association,and that they may wish to strengthen this association bydeveloping economic co-operation by means of mutual tariffconcessions, analogous to our Preferential system.     Suchdevelopments may provide, the most promising road tosatisfactory new European order, and may deserve accordinglyto be encouraged rather than discouraged.     Prom the stand-point of European reconstruction, therefore, as well asfrom the stand-point of our national and Imperial interests,it would seem unwise to commit ourselves to a condemnationof the Preferential system.13. I am dealing in this paper only with that part of thoConsideration Agreement which raises the Imperial Preferenceissues   but we are, of course, also greatly concerned about;the effect of Article VII as drafted upon our ability touse after the war measures to safeguard our economicposition unless and until better arrangements can bedevised.     In his tele grans Lord Halifax shows appreciationof this important point and he has drafted some inter -pretative clauses which at first sight seem to give us areasonable degree of flexibility,,     It is suggested thatour signature of the Agreement would b e subject to thisinterpretative document - which would, of course, have tobe made public, if only for the purpose of enabling us toexplain the Agreement and to meet criticism.14. There&quot; is another point which I would mention at thisstage.     Circumstances have changed completely since theAgreement was drafted last July.     A good deal of the preambleseems particularly out of focus in the light of recent andcurrent developments and its publication now would strikethe world as odd.     In July, the &quot;Consideration&quot; conceptionwas no doubt appropriates    it is inappropriate now when bothcountries are in an all-in war,     There should be substitutedthe conception of   reciprocal contribution (manufacturingcapacity, food, man-power, naval power, air power etc.) sothat whatever is done is done by way of contribution to theaggregate resources in the furtherance of a common cause,each contributing according to capacity,      (This Is adoctrine which should apply also to inter-Empire effort).(initialled)     K.W.Treasury chambers,Great George Street, S.-W. le17TH JANUARY, 1942*
