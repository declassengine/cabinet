THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1944.SECRET. / Copy No.W.P. (44) 72.3rd February, 1944.WAR CABINET.FREE SIAMESE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN accordance with the conclusions of the War Cabinet on the 3rd January(W.M. 1 (44), Minute 8), I circulate to my colleagues the text of a draft declaration in favour of the restoration after the war of a free and independent Siam.2. This declaration, which has been agreed, with minor amendments, at thedepartmental level, does not, I submit, tie our hands in regard to a country at war with us, nor does it make any specific commitments in regard to boundaries.Unless I hear that any of my colleagues wishes to raise any point on the draft,declaration, I propose to arrange for the declaration to be made at an appropriate moment, in the course of a general review of foreign affairs.A. E.Foreign Office, 3rd February, 1944.Draft Declaration concerning Siam.&quot; The position of Siam is in some respects unique in the Far East, though not without parallel in Europe. A country with a long tradition of friendship with us has, though admittedly under pressure from Japan, betrayed thatfriendship. Not content with collaborating with our enemy and despite hertreaty of non-aggression with us, the quisling Government of Luang Pibul took the initiative in declaring war upon us.&quot; For these acts Siam is already paying the price and will undoubtedly payable yet heavier price as the war reaches her territories. It is still possible for thepeople of Siam to do something to save themselves from the worst consequences of their betrayal and they will be judged by the efforts which they make to redeemthemselves from the position in which the action of their present regime hasplaced them. Like other countries in like case &apos; they must work their passagehome.&apos; If they do so they can look to this country to support the emergence ofa free and independent Siam after the war is over.&quot;12274   [26859]
