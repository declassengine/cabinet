THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.secret.P. (44) 55.251h January, 1944.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER 1943 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES and mandated TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.THE Canadian Legations in the United States, the Soviet Union, China andBrazil have been elevated to the rank of Embassies, the respective foreignLegations in Ottawa assuming the same status. It has also been announced thatthe Belgian Legation in Ottawa will be raised to an Embassy, although noreciprocal action will be taken for the time being. A Turkish Legation is to beestablished in Ottawa.2. Feeling that there is a growing lack of confidence in the present Govern-ment, the leaders of the Liberal Party have set themselves to revive theirpopularity, and there has been a succession of speeches by members of the Cabinet,all heralding reform, and holding out confident hopes of a roseate post-war era.3. In one of these speeches Mr. Howe, the Minister of Munitions and supply, announced a Nine-Point Plan for &quot;making Canadians the happiestpeople on God&apos;s green earth.&quot; He urged that post-war objectives should be the raising of the standard of living; that Canada should establish for herself a place in civil and international aviation; reafforestation; and the enlargement of domestic and foreign markets.4. In the course of another speech, Mr. Bertrand, Minister of Fisheries,confirmed the earlier indication from Mr. Mackenzie King that the Governmentwould not ask Parliament to extend its term of office, which expires in March1945, and this means a Dominion election within the next 14 months.5. When speaking on the anniversary of his election to the leadership ofthe Progressive Conservative Party, Mr. Bracken, who has as yet no seat in theHouse, urged the necessity for decentralisation, and defined the ProgressiveParty&apos;s policy as standing for a &quot; comprehensive system of national reform.&quot; Inthis speech Mr. Bracken regained for himself some of the limelight which hadbeen given to Colonel Drew, Premier of Ontario, in the last few weeks.Mr. Bracken&apos;s supporters hope he will assume full leadership by entering theHouse, but at present there is no sign of his seeking election.6. A further exposition of the attitude of the Roman Catholic Church onSocialism made made by the Bishop of Toronto, who issued an unequivocalcondemnation, and this brought forth a statement by Mr. Coldwell, the leader ofthe C.C.F., in which he said that the C.C.F. did not deny the right of ownership of private property. There is evidence that the C.C.F. have recently lost some oftheir support, possibly on account of labour troubles, and of certain totalitarianleanings which the movement has shown. At a recent by-election in Alberta, theC.C.F. candidate was eliminated in the first round.[26778] copy No.
7. Mr. Mitchell Hepburn, the former Liberal Premier of Ontario, and nowan Independent Member, has reappeared on the Ontario scene. Mr. Hepburn&apos;political future is still obscure, but many people think that he is likely to return in a prominent position. At a recent caucus, the Liberal members of theProvincial House decided to co-operate with the Government in all matters notcompromising Liberal principles, and agreed to invite Mr. Hepburn to the nextcaucus.8. The labour situation in Canada continued to deteriorate during december, and a number of strikes occurred. As a result of coal strikes atAlberta and British Columbia, a Royal Commission, with powers equal to theNational War Labour Board, was set up, and awarded an increase in the priceof coal. Speaking on this action, Mr. Ilsley warned Labour that it will suffer ifthe price stabilisation plan is wrecked. Similar action was taken in EasternCanada clS cl result of strikes in Nova Scotia.9. A new Wartime Wage Control Order, which provides for the establish-&apos;merit of wage rates incorporating the cost of living bonus, was strongly opposed by the President of the Canadian Congress of Labour and also by the Trades andLabour Congress.Service A activities.10. Having moved across from the left flank of the 8th Army, the1st Canadian Division took over from the 78th Division in the Adriatic coastalsector on the 4th and quickly pushed patrols, accompanied by tanks, across theRiver Moro. The tanks, however, soon became bogged. During the second week of December a period of heavy rain set in accompanied by mist, which deprivedour troops of the usual air support; in spite of these unfavourable conditions,and overcoming determined opposition and frequent German counter-attacks, the canadians&apos; first enlarged their bridgehead over the Moro and brought forwardtheir supporting weapons and then forged their way gradually forward until bythe 15th they had reached the Ortona-Orsogna road. On the 19th Canadiantanks broke through the enemy anti-tank screen and overran his infantrypositions in the Ortona area, inflicting heavy casualties. By the third week ofthe month most of the Ortona-Orsogna road was in our hands, though Ortonaitself still held firm. After eight days of hard and close fighting, during which both sides used tanks, troops of the Canadian division finally captured Ortonaon the 28th after the bitterest street, fighting. By next day they had gone forward&apos;2\ miles beyond the town. By the end of the month real winter weather had set in with snow on the hills and mud and floods in the valleys, making conditions for the troops most arduous.11. Bomber squadrons of the R.C.A.F. in the United Kingdom flew fewersorties in December than in the previous month, mainly on account of weather.Activities by Coastal and Fighter Squadrons scarcely changed, but Fighter-Reconnaissance showed a marked decrease. Bad weather at base on return from two successful night raids unfortunately cost Bomber Squadrons several aircraft,especially on the occasion of one of the Berlin raids.12. R.C.A.F. Fighter Squadrons destroyed 24 enemy aircraft during themonth; in other operations a submarine was hit by cannon fire off Norway, four ships and six escort vessels, also off Norway, were hit by R.P. and cannon fire,and a vessel of about 150 feet was sunk in the Channel.13. Losses amounted to 30 Bombers missing and one landed in theChannel, all the crew in this case being saved. Eight Fighters and three CoastalFighter-Reconnaissance aircraft were also lost.AUSTRALIA.14. The main feature of the Australian Labour Party Conference held at canberra during December was the unanimous adoption of a resolution, moved by Mr. Curtin, endorsing the policy of participation by Australia in the further development of co-operation among the British Commonwealth of Nations, thenations of the world, and, in particular, the nations bordering on the Pacific.In moving the resolution, Mr. Curtin said that the British Commonwealth hadexemplified how autonomous &quot;nations could collaborate in matters of mutualinterest and in the working of an international democracy. He then restatedhis proposals for improving the machinery for Empire co-operation.   While
oOadvocating full and continuous consultation, he realised that, as the PrimeMinisters could, not remain constantly in London, an Imperial War Cabinet wasimpossible, and thought that the best interim arrangement was for an accreditedrepresentative to be appointed to serve with the United Kingdom War Cabinet.A Sub-Committee of the Imperial Conference, consisting of the High Commis-sioners in London and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, should beset up in London, thus forming a permanent secretariat. After declaring thatthe nucleus of the machinery for international co-operation must be the four.Great Powers of Britain, America, Russia and China, with whom Australia must-collaborate when their interests were also involved, Mr. Curtin proclaimed thatrif the &quot; Labour Party is to maintain its place in the vanguard of the march of human progress, it must not fail to do its part in this momentous opportunity tobring nearer to achievement the fellowship and welfare of all peace-lovingpeoples.&quot; Mr. Curtin&apos;s statement on Empire relations is of particular interestbecaase it was made at, and accepted by, the Labour Party Conference.15. Of the two other important decisions taken at the Labour party conference, one was the ratification of the Cabinet&apos;s decision to seek a referendum early in 1944, covering only the fourteen powers recommended at theConstitutional Convention of December 1942 (see Report for November), and leaving the question of wider constitutional reforms until after the war. Theother was the passing of a resolution that the Government should not try to carryout extremes of party policy.16. As a result of a meeting of the Federal and State Health Ministers, a food standard for Australian civilians was adopted. It includes a scheme for controlling milk distribution, on the basis that the amount of milk available for civilian consumption should be retained at pre-war levels. Concern is expressed at the growing opinion that food shortages are due not so much to faulty distri-bution, but to the demands of the American forces, and in Queensland, wheremost of these forces are, and where supplies have been shortest, a ministerialenquiry is being made into the position.. 17. Mr. J. J. Maloney, the new Australian Minister to Russia, was receivedby M. Molotov on his arrival in Moscow on the 23rd December to take up his new duties,Service Activities.18. New Guinea, Finschhafen area.--The advance northwards from Bongacontinued and on the 2nd Gusika, three-quarters of a mile north of Bonga, was occupied. Heavy fighting took place north of Gusika, but Australian troops, withtank and artillery support, continued to move forward steadily. The advanceof the tanks was considerably delayed by land mines reinforced with extra charges.19. Satelberg-W areo area. At the beginning of the month, strong Japanesecounter-attacks forced the Australians in the sector just south-east of Wareo towithdraw somewhat. A flanking movement against the enemy&apos;s rear on theKuanko- Wareo track forced his withdrawal and thus allowed the reoccupationof Kuanko on the 6th and Wareo itself two days later. Some heavy fightingtook place in this area with considerable Japanese casualties. Throughout theoperation our troops received valuable assistance from the artillery.20. Ramu Valley area. There has been no major action. On the 8th anenemy force about 50 strong attacked our forward elements in the area 5 miles north of Kesawai. The attack was repulsed and the Japanese were seen laterdigging in on a ridge 5% miles north-north-west&apos; of Kesawai. This ridgedominates the Ramu Valley in the Kesawai21. Australia. In order to cope with the shortage of civil medical practitioners, 200 officers of the Australian Army Medical Corps have been released from the army during the last ten months to resume civil practice.Arrangements have also been made for Australian Army Medical Corps officers to help the civil communit)^ in an honorary capacity in case of emergency.22. In accordance with the Governments policy to release 20,000 men fromthe army to rural industry by June 1944, selected military personnel of specifiedcategories are now being discharged at the rate of 2,000 per month. These arein addition to the normal discharges from the army of about 4,500 men per month..&quot;&apos;      [2677,8] , ^ b 2
23. The last of the three Forestry Companies of the Australian ImperialForce, which had been on service in the United Kingdom for over three years, hasnow arrived back in Australia.24. Forty-nine British and Indian Army officers, who came to Australiafrom India to gain operational experience in jungle warfare, have completeda series of attachments to the jungle warfare training centre and other training schools in Queensland and have left for New Guinea to be attached to operationalunits of their respective arms and services.25. Malaria. For the week ending the 3rd Deceiriber, malaria casualties in New Guinea were : (i) Forward operational areas, 51-8 per 1,000 per week;(ii) whole of New Guinea, 16-9 per 1,000 per week. This shows a slight decreaseon the preceding week whose figures were the highest recorded during a progressive increase ever since the 24th September, 1943, when the rates per 1,000were 9-3 and 6-8 respectively.26. The total United States forces (Army and Air Corps) in the South-west pacific area at the end of December were 323,476 all ranks.NEW ZEALAND.27. On his arrival, Mr. D&apos;Alton, the recently appointed High Commissionerfor Australia in New Zealand, emphasised the need for unity between Australiaand New Zealand and said : &apos;&apos; We are entitled to be heard in the Grand Councilof the United Nations now and when post-war problems are planned. In pressingthese views, it is vital that Australia and New Zealand should keep closely instep.&quot; He also told his listeners that New Zealanders were much better off for food and clothing than the Australians were.28. .Tn commenting on Mr. Attlee&apos;s recent statement in the House ofCommons that a constant succession of Imperial Conferences would notnecessarily indicate any closer relation, Mr. Holland, leader of the Opposition,said that he favoured frequent Imperial Conferences because the position changedso rapidly that decisions taken soon became of no use. He also expressed thehope that the exchange of views would not be limited to Ministers, as all sectionsof Parliament were equally concerned.29. Parliament has been prorogued until the end of January. When itreassembles at the beginning of February a new War Damage Bill will be intro-duced, by which the war damage insurance will be reduced from 5s. per cent,to Is. from the 1st March.30. The school-leaving age will be raised from 14 years to 15 years on the1st February.31. The war has brought much prosperity to New Zealand, despite thestaggering taxation figure of  46 million now to be borne by a population of little over \\ million. The greatest strain has been felt in man-power resources.In this connexion, some 15,000 New Zealand soldiers of the Home Forces havebeen transferred to production services, mainly in connexion with agricultural production, in order that the maximum quantity of food may be sent to Britain.;,Service Activities.32. At the beginning of the month the 2nd New Zealand Mixed division was in the Orsogna-Guardiagrele sector on the left of the 8th Army. . By the4th they had captured Orsogna after heavy fighting and were making good progress towards Guardiagrele, while further to the left they had occupied Casoli.The following day, however, the Germans made a heavy counter-attack againstOrsogna supported by tanks and flame throwers and, after very severe fighting,recaptured the town. Two days later our forces continued the attack; althoughit started well, the New Zealanders came up against very strong resistance nearOrsogna and, being unable to move forward their supporting weapons owing tothe state of the ground, were obliged to fall back to their start-line. After this a period of heavy rain set in which hampered our air support and. ground move-ments and aided the enemy in his stubborn resistance. By the -15th german counter-attacks had slackened somewhat and elements of the New Zealand division, which had all the time been making continuous though slow progress,had gained a footing astride the Ortona-Orsogna road.
33. On the 16th two major counter-attacks were delivered against the New-Zealanders and troops of the 8th Indian Division on their right. Both attacksfailed with heavy losses to the Germans in men and tanks. The following day ouradvance continued and made steady progress. On the right more ground wasgained beyond the Ortona-Orsogna&quot; road in the direction of Tollo; on the left,in the New Zealand sector, the situation remained practically stationary untilthe end of the month although the New Zealand division maintained close contact with the enemy round Orsogna.34. A Fijian battalion has now joined the United States forces inBougainville.SOUTH AFRICA., 35. There was a feeling of relief among Government supporters at the return%)i the Prime Minister, since they hope that serious attempts will now be madeto remedy the deficiencies of internal administration. The Minister of Railways,for example, has admitted the justice of some of the complaints against the food control Organisation and the failure of the Government to take sufficiently sternmeasures against profiteers. He also deplored the tendency of public opinion tothink of the Cabinet as &quot; a rotten one,&quot; held together only by the Prime Minister.36. Newspapers of all shades of opinion continue to press for plans for thesettlement of the many post-war problems, and a scheme is being prepared to combine twenty-six United Party M.Ps. from the Rand in a bloc to force theGovernment into more constructive action. Some of the criticisms may be met by the announcement that the Prime Minister is now examining departmentalplans for post-war development, and has requested all Ministers to return toPretoria for a series of Cabinet meetings from the 4th to the 12th January, toconsider them and to prepare the legislative programme for the parliamentary session opening on the 22nd.37. There is also considerable restiveness among the white miners in theRand. Recent rises in the value of gold shares, together with the increasingcost of living, are the underlying causes.38. There was much controversy over the Government decision to reprieveRobey Leibbrandt, the traitor who was sentenced to death for sabotage.Opposition papers express their appreciation of the Government&apos;s action, whilepro-Government papers are divided.NEWFOUNDLAND.39. The future of Newfoundland was the subject of discussion in the Houseof Commons on two occasions during the month; first in the debate on ImperialAffairs, during which the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Dominion affairs made a statement regarding the isla,nd&apos;s constitutional future, and second whenthe members of the recent Parliamentary Mission to Newfoundland reported tothe House on the result of their visit to the island.40. The statement, made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, proposedthat, whilst there should be no change in the form of Government until the warin Europe had ended, our policy to Newfoundland should be based on the arrange-ments made under the 1933 Act whereby the restoration of equal self-governmentwas promised to the Newfoundland people, should they request it, as soon as the island was again self-supporting. It was also proposed, in consultation with theCommission of Government, to provide as soon as possible after the end of theEuropean war suitahle machinery to- enable the people of Newfoundland toexamine the future of the island and to express their considered views as to theform of Government they desired, having regard to the conditions at that time.In the meantime the Government proposed to press on vigorously with thedevelopment of local government and with general reconstruction plans.41. In the debate on Newfoundland affairs, which followed later in themonth, a Motion tabled by the members of the Parliamentary Mission welcomingthe statement was carried without a division after an amendment in the nameof Mr. Maxton calling for the immediate restoration of self-government hadbeen defeated.
42. The three Members put forward in their speeches recommendations forthe constitutional and economic development of Newfoundland and, whilst paying-tribute to the work done by the Commission, expressed the view that the people,who at present had little to- say in the conduct of the affairs of their country,should be educated as rapidly as possible in the art of local and of self-govern-ment. The members of the Mission were unanimous in their belief thatNewfoundland could become a prosperous and independent member of the.Commonwealth provided she received adequate aid from the United Kingdom,and they proposed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should declare themselvesready to draw up a ten-year development programme, the cost of which theyestimated at between  16 million and  20 million; this sum to be provided byloans or by outright grant from the United Kingdom Exchequer. The membersagreed that there was a complete absence of political organisation and unity inthe island and they trusted that local government would receive vigorousencouragement. In&quot; their opinion there was no desire locally either for federation with Canada or with the United States.43. In reply the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, whilst welcoming the,suggestions and recommendations made in the course of the debate, pointed outthat if complete self-government was restored this must involve responsibility forthe island&apos;s finances, but that this did not mean that any form of financialassistance should be ruled out. In concluding the debate he reiterated the viewthat the future form of Government in Newfoundland was a question for thepeople themselves to decide and that His Majesty&apos;s Government had no desire to influence their choice in any way.EIRE.44. In his usual Christmas night broadcast, Mr. de Valera began by sayingthat the people of Eire should fervently thank God that they had been so farspared from the horrors of war, and pray that they might continue to be spareduntil the end. He said that the shortage of necessities had brought privations,but there was not the absolute want which elsewhere in these terrible years had brought starvation and death. Their land had not been devastated, their farm-,houses had not been levelled and their cities had not been destroyed. After thelast shot had been fired a further critical period of years would open for them as well as for all the other nations years of general readjustment and recon-struction in which restrictions in material needs would be bound to continue.45. At a dinner in Cork given by the Federation of Irish Manufacturerson the 7th December, Mr. de Valera, discussing Protection, said that this policy was necessary at the start but that there was a great danger in it because itmight lead to inefficiency and to the population having to pay unreasonable prices.If such a situation were to continue, they might have a revolt which might easilyexpress itself in a change of Government or in a change of national policy. Ifthe policy of bringing up industry was to persist, the people in industry should see that they were using the best and most scientific methods and have the greatestco-operation between owner and workers. He believed in private enterprise as itwas more efficient. Continuing, Mr. de Valera said that it was essential foradvancement in industrial policy to have an independent Tariff Board whichwould be able to report whether or not the community was getting fair play of whether industry was being run efficiently. Although the farmers did not agreewith Protection, it was a good policy for them because only a portion of thosewho were brought up on the land could hope to remain on it. The balance wouldhave either to emigrate or find employment at home. The Government hoped to bring uneconomic farms up to a reasonable economic level and to create atotal of 400,000 such farms in the country.46. On the 2nd December Mr. de Valera made a statement in the Dail onthe machine-gun attack by an aircraft on the Eire ship Kerlogue on the23rd October, while on her way to Spain, in which the master of the ship and three members of the crew were wounded. Mr. de Valera said that ammunitionfragments had been found to be of British origin. Representations were immediately made to the British Government who instituted enquiries and confirmed that the Kerlogue had been attacked by British aircraft. &quot;Theyinformed us,&quot; said Mr. de Valera, &quot;that the attacking plane did not identify the ship as Irish and that at the time of the attack the Kerlogue was sailing offher course, a fact which has been confirmed from the ship&apos;s log.   For that reason
the British Government will not accept responsibility for the attack but theyare prepared to make a payment ex gratia to the injured men.&quot; In fact, although there is some conflict of evidence as to the exact position of the Kerlogue at thetime Of the attack, it is clear that she was not only far off the course prescribedfor her under navicert arrangements, but about to enter the prohibited zone inthe Bay of Biscay, if she had not already done so.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.47. Public comment on the war maintained a tone of confident optimismthroughout the month, encouraged by Russian resilience and successes, the bombing of Berlin, the sinking of the Scharnkorst, and especially by the con-ferences at Cairo and Tehran. Particular gratification was expressed at theassociation of China in the discussions at Cairo. No doubt is felt of the ultimateAllied victory, and Japanese propaganda and threats of invasion are discountedaccordingly.48. The internal situation, helped by the perceptible improvement in thesupply and distribution of food, remains quiet. The Viceroy, having alreadyvisited the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province after his initial visit toBengal, made brief visits to Orissa and Assam and returned to Calcutta, where he delivered the customary annual speech to the Associated Chambers of Com-merce. In this, his first substantial public speech since entering on his office,Lord Wavell devoted himself mainly to economic issues and made no pronounce-ment on the political situation; he disclaimed the view that political differencescould be solved by administrative action but believed that by co-operation infacing administrative problems much could be done to produce conditions inwhich the solution of the political deadlock would be possible.49. No important political. development occurred during the month. the moslem League, the Hindu Mahasabha and the Indian Liberals all held meetingsduring the Christmas week, but no sign of any fresh approach to the constitutionalissue emerged from their deliberations.External and Frontier Relations.50. A afghanistan.-Th.ere is little of importance to report during december and no further news was received of the condition of the Prime Minister, whohas been recovering from an attack of angina pectoris.51. His Majesty&apos;s Minister has reported that during recent months therehas been a growing desire among Afghans to cultivate the British and Americans.Many young Afghans of the educated classes have begun to realise the great&quot;atdvantages to be gained by the establishment of close and friendly relations with america, Great Britain and India. No doubt this attitude has been stimulated by the war news and by the knowledge that India and America have made efforts to meet, as far as possible, the essential Afghan requirements in goods andcommodities, but it does appear that, for the moment at any rate, the feeling-is a reasonably genuine one.52. Negotiations for the purchase, on behalf of the Soviet Government, of10,000 tons of Afghan wool have been successfully concluded in Kabul by arepresentative of the U.K.C.C.53. North-West Frontier-Activity of hostile gangs has continued in north Wazirisfean. On the 13th December, near Razmak, troops on trainingmanoeuvres encountered a gang of hostile Mahsud tribesmen, and an actionensued which resulted in casualties of 21 killed (including 1 British officer) and20 wounded. At least 7 of the tribesmen were killed and a number wounded.It is reported that this encounter was fortuitous, and that there has been no general deterioration in the tribal situation. Elsewhere the frontier remainedquiet.54. Persian 6!wZ/.^-Considerable interest was shown in the Conference ofAllied leaders and anxiety was manifested over Mr. Churchill&apos;$. health. AtBahrein there was a strike of Arab employees in the Refinery of the Bahrein
Petroleum Oil Company, and 450 men were on strike on the 24th December. Themen were advised to return to work, when their grievances would be investigated.55. The American Oil Mission to the Middle East proposed to visit Koweitand Bahrein between the 16th and 18th December, and to make an air reconnaissance down the Gulf.   No report has yet been received of their visit.56. China. On his return journey through India from the CairoConference the Generalissimo stopped at Ramgarh and inspected Chinese troops under training there. No intimation was given to the Government of India ofhis intention to make this inspection.Finance.57. Borrowing -New ground has been broken by the announcement that aPrize Bond issue will be on sale from the 15th January next. Subscribers&apos;capital will be repaid in 5 years&apos; time, but no interest will be payable on the bonds. Instead there will be half-yearly drawings by lot for prizes (tax free)amounting in the aggregate to the equivalent of interest at 2 per cent, per annum.It is hoped that the issue will prove attractive to many who would not subscribe to other forms of Government investment, and so contribute to the absorption ofredundant purchasing power.58. Gold Sales. His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided to aim at treblingthe amount of their gold sales in India, hitherto running at the rate of aboutf million ounces a quarter. It is possible that these sales, together with those on american account, will result in the absorption of redundant purchasing power at the rate of Rs. 160 to 200 crores ( 120 to 150 million a year). The directanti-inflationary effect should thus be considerable. In addition, the holding of commodities should be discouraged, both by the offer of this alternative invest-ment and by the apprehension of lower commodity prices. Incidentally, also, therate of growth of India&apos;s sterling assets will be correspondingly reduced.Economic.59. Food. -During December the import of food grains into Bengal, coupled with the assistance in transport and distribution given by the Army, haseffectively secured the Province from food shortage for the time being. Problemsof post-famine nutrition will continue for some time to come.60. The main rice crop now being harvested is a particularly heavy one, and,with the autumn crop of 1943, would probably suffice to cover the requirements ofthe Province for the crop year to July 1944. Arrangements for procurement ofthat part of the crop which Government requires to hold within its own control are the subject of discussion between the Central Food Department and the bengal Government. They are to be mainly in the hands of five principal agentsdrawn from the trade working under the control of a committee and supervisedby Government officers. The Central Government is to assist by supplyingCalcutta for the year in order to help in the restoration of confidence and reducethe pressure on Bengal markets. Rationing in Calcutta itself has been furtherpostponed until mid-January. Further reductions in the price of rice have takenplace both in Bengal and elsewhere. The control price in Bengal is nowRs. 11/12 per maund as compared with Rs. 37 in the late summer of last year.61. Elsewhere in India the food situation has been generally satisfactory.The Punjab Government has reluctantly agreed to apply rationing and price control from next autumn crop and the Sind Government are acting upon thedirection of the Central Government that they shall introduce rationing in theProvince. Unofficial estimates of the rice crop for 1943-44 (based on officialrecords of acreage) forecast an increase of some 3 million tons over the figure oflast year.   The official tonnage estimates are not yet available.62. On the question of price control there is to be a Conference between theCentral Food Department and representatives of Provinces and States early inthe New Year, and the attitude of the Provinces generally and of the surplusProvinces in particular, now seems favourable to the early introduction of an effective all-India food prices policy under the guidance of the Central Govern -ment.   Shipments of wheat and barley from overseas continue to arrive.63. Bengal Health Situation.--The health situation in Bengal consequent upon the famine remains very serious. Between the 27th June and 27th November,.
it is believed that 87,845 persons died of cholera in the Province, and the deathrate from this disease averaged in November 4,864 per week against 5,349 perweek in October. Malaria is affecting a high percentage of those suffering fromunder-nourishment, which has reduced their usual comparative immunity to the disease. Stocks of quinine in India are substantial and large quantities of anti-malarial synthetics have been offered to the Government of India from the UnitedKingdom; but the arrangements for the distribution of supplies inside Bengalhave been faulty. This is being improved. Dysentery and smallpox threaten to add to the death roll and those convalescing from starvation are specially liable topneumonia, to counter which supplies of clothing have to be distributed in the districts. Medical relief is now one of the primary duties of the military forcesassisting the Government of Bengal. In order to reinforce and eventually replace them civil personnel both doctors and subordinate staff are required, but there is great difficulty in recruiting these locally.64. Coal. The low level of coal production continues to present a veryserious problem in India. Various measures have been taken to improve thesituation, including the appointment of Mr. P. C. Young as Coal Commissioner,in order to co-ordinate the activities in regard to coal of all the Departments ofthe Government of India. Attempts are being made to attract labour back to the mines by providing miners and their families with food rations at concessionalprices, by extended welfare work and by permitting women to work underground,which, in pursuance of an international convention to which India is a party, hasbeen prohibited since 1937. Wage rates and the effect on production of the IndianExcess Profits Tax are also being examined.65. Steel Commissioner. Following on Sir John Duncanson&apos;s visit to indian the course of his Empire tour in the summer of 1943, the Government of Indiaasked for the appointment from this country of a man with knowledge of theBritish Iron and Steel Control and its procedure to take the post of SteelCommissioner in India. Mr. F. Parr, formerly Director of Plant Progress underthe Iron and Steel Control has now gone to India in this capacity. It is intended that he should co-ordinate the activities of the Steel Controller in India withthose of Controller of Imports, and he should also regulate the distribution ofquotas in India in something of the same way as is done by the Chairman of the materials Committee in this country. Mr. Parr is to work under the supply department in India.66. S.S. Fort Buckingham. Twenty-one British members of the crew ofthis ship, which is earmarked for military operations, refused duty, apparentlyin the hope of avoiding the operations and getting back to the United Kingdom.They were sentenced to fourteen days&apos; imprisonment, but the question of their disposal after their release presented a problem. They could not be spreadamong ships similarly earmarked for operations because most of these are manned by Indian crews, and, in any case, they are obviously unreliable men. Nor couldthey be directed to ships not earmarked for operations because this might encourage the crews of other ships similarly earmarked to copy their tactics. Asthey were all of military age, it was decided, after consultation with interested departments at home, to conscript them into the British Army for service in theEast.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.Royal Indian Navy.67. One Fairmile was completed and eight M.T.Bs. were completed andcommissioned in November.Military.68. Italy -The 8th Indian Division, forming part of the 8th Army,continues to fight its way forward against stubborn opposition. This divisioncame into the line on the 19th October and has been continuously in action since.69. North-West Frontier. The situation has generally been quiet exceptfor two incidents. In one, road-protection troops were attacked by hostiletribesmen, and in the other, troops on training.  Our troops suffered casualties.70. Burma. On the Arakan front the Japanese have withdrawn underpressure to positions North of Buthidaung. Engagements have not been on alarge scale, but enemy casualties have been much heavier than ours..[26778] c
71. Operations elsewhere have been limited to patrol activities. In theseseveral successful ambushes have been carried out both by troops and levies. In.the Chin Hills levies killed 20 Japanese in one ambush without loss, and in theSumprabum area they inflicted many casualties when they ambushed some lorries;Air. 7: - \    . ;:;72. Burma. -Weather has not been so favourable, with increased low cloud and mist both by day and night. In spite of this, there has been an increase inall forms of the air effort. Enemy opposition to strategic day bombing hasincreased, indicating that enemy defences have been i strengthened. heavy fighting has resulted with losses to both sides. Attacks on transport and supply-dropping aircraft have also increased, necessitating the provision of fighterescorts.73. The RAP. have carried out strategic night bombing of communica-tions, storage dumps, airfields and railway yards. Enemy concentrations in central Burma and Taungup areas have been attacked by day. Dive-bombing insupport of our troops has been carried out in Arakan and Chin Hills areas. TheU.S.A.A.F. made their heaviest efforts against targets in the Rangoon area.Mines were laid in the Rangoon estuary and the Moulmein Channel.74. Enemy activity increased. Feni airfield, Tiddim and Agartala were bombed. Two strong daylight raids on the Kidderpore docks area of Calcuttaearly in December caused small-scale damage. Service casualties were slight, butthere were 500 civilian casualties. . The population as a whole remained steady,though there was a temporal disappearance of dockers, necessitating the pro-vision of military labour.General.75. Health and Morale. Sick rates continue satisfactory, while moraleremains high. British and Indian troops still feel, however, that their part in thewar is not receiving the publicity it deserves. Burma is referred to as Theforgotten front.&quot;76. Relations with American troops are improving where there are contacts between the two forces, but there is no change in the towns, where there is corn-petition for the few available amusements.77. Indian soldiers are still worried over the economic conditions of their families and consider increases in pay overdue. Educated Muslim troops welcomeTurkish friendship with the United Nations.78. Famine Relief. There has been a marked improvement caused byexcellent crops and the speedier distribution of supplies by the military. Thechief problem of the latter now is the provision of clothing, blankets and medicalsupplies. Large quantities, especially of blankets, are still required. 30,000tons of food have been distributed by the Army.79. Recruiting. There was little change in the intake in November for anyof the Services.80. Remounts. 6,300 horses, ponies and mules have so far been supplied to the Chinese forces in India.81. Christmas entertainment.  105,000 was provided, largely by publicsubscription, for the provision of amenities for British troops. Every effort wasmade, as far as operations permitted, to provide every British soldier with poultry,plum pudding and cake, with such extras as walnuts, raisons, toffee, ginger and anadditional rum ration on Christmas Day.82. Presents of sweets, playing cards, writing paper, pens, vests andhandkerchiefs were sent to Indian troops overseas.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.83. Occupied Burma. On Ba Maw&apos;s return from the Greater East AsiaConference continued publicity was given to its aims, and at a ceremony inRangoon to commemorate the second anniversary of the war resolutions are saidto have been passed in which the unity of the people and their determination tpcarry on the war to a successful conclusion were stressed.
84. Burmese administration was formally inaugurated in the Shan andKarenni States on the 24th December, and Ba Maw issued on appeal to the Shan,rulers for unity and co-operation in maintaining Burma&apos;s independence.85. The appointment (allegedly at Ba Maw&apos;s request) of Gotaro Ogawa, amember of the Japanese House of Representatives who has held the portfolios ofCommerce and Railways, as Supreme Adviser to the Burmese Government, was reported early in December.86. It is reported that the price of paddy in the Delta regions has fallen to a quarter of the pre-evacuation level and that large areas under paddy have gone out of cultivation.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Food Supplies.East Africa.87. Reports received during December confirmed and.indeed increased thefears roused by reports during November of a serious shortage of foodstuffs forthe native population during the first half of 1944 due to the failure of the shortrains. The total prospective import deficiency of cereal grains has now beententatively put at 145,000 tons in place of the 100,000 tons previously notifiedby the East African authorities. The higher figure has not yet been entered asa firm demand for imports, but will be subject to review in February. In themeantime, arrangements are proceeding for imports against the 100,000 tonsprogramme and ships have been programmed by the Ministry of War Transportproviding for a total import into East Africa of 55,000 tons odd by the end ofApril. By far the greater part of this import will be wheat from Australia.The East African native prefers maize as the diet to which he is accustomed,but it has been found on investigation that no substantial quantities of maize insatisfactory condition are available from any source from which they could be shipped to East Africa. There was a report of some old crop maize in theArgentine, but on further investigation this was reported to be in weevilycondition and was not, therefore, accepted.Ceylon.88. Supplies of wheat from Australia and rice from Egypt have beenarriving fairly regularly in Ceylon and have enabled the ration scale to bemaintained. The allocation, however, of 50,000 tons made to Ceylon from thepresent Indian rice crop will only meet Ceylon&apos;s needs for rice up to about theend of May 1944 and I am much concerned about the position between that date and the end of 1944 when the next Egyptian crop may be expected. The existing-rice ration in Ceylon is only a quarter of the normal pre-war scale (the balanceof the ration being made up in wheat flour) and I am advised that this riceration could not be further reduced without very serious effects in the shape of discontent and loss of labour from essential rubber and tea production.Cocoa from the French Cam&amp;roons.89. Arrangements were made for the West African Produce Control board to purchase this crop at a provisional price of Frs. 2,600 per thousand kilos, whichis fully equal, quality for quality, to the prices paid in British territory. TheFrench authorities in Algiers had pressed for Frs. 3,000, but the Board did not feel justified in agreeing to this figure, and felt that if the French authorities,[26778] d
on further consideration, were of the opinion that the price to the producer was too low, it was for them to subsidise that price in order to bring it up to whatwas considered to be a reasonable level. The Board expressed the hope that theFrench authorities would inform His Majesty&apos;s Government at as early a stageas possible should this course be decided upon, since substantially different priceson either side of the frontier might prove embarrassing to all concerned.Tea from Ceylon.: 90. Discussions have been taking place between Mr. Saravanamuttu, the ceylon Tea Commissioner, and the Ministry of Food on the question of the price for the 1944 contract. On the basis that the tea estates should earn the samegross profit as in the basic years 1938-39, the Ministry of Food have offered toincrease the factor necessary to ensure this from 4fd. to 6fd. per lb.Defence.West Indies.91. My colleagues have agreed in principle that a West Indian contingentshould be moved to serve with the Central Mediterranean Force as soon as possible after April 1944. Detailed arrangements for the transport of the contingent willbe worked out by my Department in consultation with the War Office and theMinistry of War Transport.West A fried.92. The Commander of the United States African Middle East Wing atAccra has been sounded by Washington regarding the possibility of employingAmerican coloured troops in West Africa. He consulted Lord Swinton on thesubject and was informed by him that in the Resident Ministers view there wouldbe serious objections to the employment of such troops. The American Commanderreplied that he himself shared Lord Swinton&apos;s opinions with which also theColonial Office and other Departments concerned are in entire agreement. HisMajesty&apos;s Embassy in Washington has been informed of the position and has beenasked in consultation with the Joint Staff Mission to try and ensure that the project is dropped.Mauritius.93. The 1st Mauritius Regiment on their arrival at Diago Suarez fromMauritius burnt some of their huts as a protest against the standard of accommo-dation and next day carried out a sit-down strike. The battalion was disarmedon the 22nd December to prevent further disorder and approximately 343 rankswere arrested for being out of bounds on the day after the sit-down strike. Tenmore were arrested for more serious offences. The Governor has informed me thatthe news has not yet reached Mauritius and that he feels strongly that in no circumstances should the battalion or any portion of it return to the island untilthe incident has been lived down.Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.94. The Hebrew press engaged in considerable speculation regardingdiscussions on partition believed, to be taking place in London with Dr. Weizmann.There has been intensive political activity over the composition of a delegation which the Jewish Agency intend to send to London to meet Dr. Weizmann.95. Whilst search for a Polish deserter was being carried out at the JewishSettlement of Hulda on the 3rd October, sixty-five 2-inch mortar shells and80 ballistite cartridges were discovered. Seven of the settlers were arrested andsubsequently tried and convicted. One of them received 6 years&apos; imprisonment,two others 5 years, another 3 years and the. remaining three 2 years. the sentences were subject to confirmation by the G.O.C. Apart from some glorifica-tion of these &quot;martyrs &quot; in the cause of &quot; defence,&quot; a notable lack of publicityan this case was significant in relation to the intense agitation fermented over the search of Ramat Hakovesh, a full report of which was given last month.
96. Illegal broadcasts have made their reappearance with two emissionsfrom a station styling itself the Fighting Peoples&apos; Station. From various indica-tions it would seem as if they were run by Irgun (the Eevisionist illegal military organisation).97. There has been some agitation over the issue of the new badge approved in January 1943 for the Palestine Regiment (an olive branch with the wordPalestine in three official languages as on the Palestine coins) as not beingdistinctively Jewish in design. A number of soldiers refused to wear the badgeand have been tried by court martial. This agitation was a Revisionist manoeuvreand has been discountenanced by the Histadruth newspaper Davar.98. On the 9th December a Jew was arrested carrying a suitcase containing,in addition to a revolver and some ammunition, machined parts in various stages of manufacture, together with literature and drawings relating to light automaticweapons. In the opinion of military experts, these parts, when finished andassembled, would produce a workable light machine-gun which could be made inany workshop equipped with ordinary lathes.99. There has been a decrease in the cost of living index of 9 points. Thefigure is now 230. The high cost of living, both in Palestine and Transjordan,causes considerable hardship, amongst others to civil servants.Fiji.Sugar Dispute.100. The dispute in the Fiji Sugar Industry continues. Production, whichin a normal year amounts to about 140,000 tons, is not now expected to be muchover 50,000 tons for the current crop year.101. During its December session the Legislative Council fully debated theposition. Motions for the appointment of an expert investigator from outsidethe Colony and for a Court of Arbitration and Statutory Sugar Control board were lost. The Governor reports that the attitude of Indian Members revealedthat the dispute is being used as a struggle for power and for the control of thelocal Canefarmers&apos; Union. Extremists are concerned mainly to attack theColonial Sugar Refining Company rather than with the merits of the growers&apos;case. The Fijian leaders expressed strong condemnation of the attitude adoptedby the Indians, and demanded that the Government should requisition the cropand cut it using Fijian labour.102. A system of price fixing for cane is being considered in the hope thatit will assist in a solution of the trouble.Barbados.103. The Constitution has been amended by an Act recently passed by theLegislature, the effect of which is to halve the financial and property qualifica-tions for voters (the qualification of the holding of land of the value of  5 is reduced to  2 10s.) and to reduce the income qualification by three-fifths from 50 to  20 a year. Women are now enfranchised on the same conditions asmen and are also eligible for election to the House of Assembly on the same con-&apos;ditions. This Act should serve to enfranchise a large section of the manuallabouring population.Anglo-American Caribbean Commission.104.   A report on the work of the Commission during its first two years is to be issued jointly by the British and United States Governments on the10th of January.A aviation.British West Indian Airways.105. Mr. Yerex arrived in Trinidad on the 21st December, and has hadprotracted discussions with both the Governor and the other Directors of.W.I.A. on the subject of his position and that of his American associatesin relation to the Company. He was clearly annoyed because his attempt tosecure control of B.W.I.A. had been defeated by the issue of further shares tothe Trinidad Government. Negotiations are proceeding on the question of hisfuture position in relation to the Company.
Other air activities in West Indies.106. A representative of Trans-Canada Air Lines has recently visited theWest Indies to explore the. possibility of the operation after the war of an airservice between North and South America.107. It is also reported that Pan American Airways are contemplating theestablishment in Barbados of a locally registered company whose objects would include inter alia the operation of air services to and from the island. Inview of this report the Governor has been asked to consider the issue of regula-tions under the Air Navigation Orders in Council to provide that no air servicemay operate in the Colony without a licence from the Government.Aviation Conference, Johannesburg.108. It now seems unlikely that this Conference will be held until Maynext.
