THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1944.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (44) 84.4cth February, 1944.war CABINET.THE CURZON LINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith a map illustrating the Curzon Line.The following notes upon the origin of that Line may be found useful.2. In March 1919 the Supreme Council in Paris asked its Commission onPolish Affairs to recommend a &apos;&apos; minimum &apos;&apos; eastern frontier within which thePolish Government should be authorised to organise a permanent administration.This request was made in pursuance of Point 13 of President Wilson&apos;s FourteenPoints, providing that &quot; an independent Polish State should be erected whichshould include the territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations . . . . &quot;and of Article 87 of the Treaty of Versailles which empowered the PeaceConference to determine the eastern frontiers of Poland. At the same time theAllied and Associated Powers had no mandate from Russia to dispose of former russian territories, and the Commission on Polish Affairs was therefore careful to keep its recommendation within limits already expressly conceded by theRussian Provisional Government, which had &quot; recognised the creation of anindependent Polish State, composed of all the districts inhabited in majority bythe Polish people.&quot;3. The Commission on Polish Affairs, in a report dated the 22nd April, 1919,recommended a frontier which ran from the border of East Prussia as far south as a point on the River Bug in the latitude of Chelm (orange line on map).Unlike the French and United States delegations, the British delegation regardedany eastward, extension of Polish territory beyond this line as dangerous to poland, although they recognised the political problems arising from the factthat the Soviet Government had not yet firmly established its authority. TheCommission^ report was considered by the Supreme Council which, whilesuspending its decision on the line so far proposed, authorised the Commissionto consider the frontier to be assigned to Poland in Eastern Galicia.4. The Commission presented a report on this subject on the 17th June, 1919,in which alternative frontiers were recommended. &quot;Line A&quot; (broken orangeon map) was proposed as the boundary between Poland, proper and an autonomousEastern Galicia within the Polish State; &quot; line B &quot; (broken yellow on map) was recommended if on the other hand the bulk of Eastern Galicia proper were to be excluded from Poland altogether.5. The Commission^ recommendations were adopted by the Supreme Counciland embodied in a draft treaty adopted on the 20th November, 1919, whichapproved &quot; line A &quot; as the line of division.6. In a further report of the 1st September, 1919, the Commission on PolishAffairs dealt with the section of the frontier between Chelm and the frontier of eastern Galicia, recommending that this should follow the line of the Bug. TheCommission asked the Supreme Council to declare that the line described, in thisreport and its report of the 22nd April, 1919, could be considered as markingthe limit, to the west of which the Polish Government could from now on legally /exercise the rights of sovereignty.7. This proposal was approved by the Supreme Council and two months later, after its embodiment in a formal treaty with Poland had been considered,12275   [26876]
the Supreme Council decided to give it the form, of a declaration, which was signed by M. Clemenceau as chairman of the Council on the 8th December, 1919.This declaration defined, &quot;without prejudging the eventual conditions whichwould govern the determination of the final eastern frontiers of Poland,&quot; theline between the frontier of East Prussia and the former ;frontier betweenAustria-Hungary and Russia to the west of which the Polish. Government mightset up a regular Administration, Polish claims to the territory east of the linebeing expressly reserved.8. The line thus drawn was the line to which Lord Curzon suggestedthat the Polish troops should retire in July 1920, when the fortunes of war had turned against them and they were being pursued westwards by the Sovietarmies. In Eastern Galicia the armies were to stand on the line which theyoccupied at the date of the Armistice. The proposal was made in response tothe Polish Government&apos;s appeal for help to the Allied Conference then sittingat Spa, after discussion with the French and Italian delegates; but was not adopted in any formal resolution of the Conference. With the assent of thePolish Prime Minister it was put forward by the British Government alone and was embodied in a telegram despatched to the Soviet Government on the11th July, 1920.* The telegram proposed an immediate armistice on the basisof the Supreme Council&apos;s line and envisaged a subsequent Russo-Polish peaceconference in London.9. In a lengthy note, dated the 18th July, 1920, the Soviet Governmentdeclined the proposal of British mediation, preferring direct negotiation with poland. The note stated that &apos;&apos; the Soviet Government expresses also its willingness to agree to a territorial frontier more favourable for the Polishpeople than the frontiers indicated by the Supreme Council . . . .&quot; Lord Curzon&apos;proposal accordingly led to nothing and the Russo-Polish war pursued itscourse until, the Polish troops having driven back the Russians to the east, afinal settlement was reached in the Treaty of Riga of 1921.10.   Incidentally, in September 1920, the Polish Government had made theCurzon Line &apos;&apos; the basis of its request that the Council of the League ofNations should summon the Lithuanian Government to withdraw its forces to the east of the Line.A. E.Foreign Office, 4th February, 1944.* This telegram contained a strange anomaly. It proposed that the Polish Army should withdraw to the line &quot;provisionally laid down last year by the peace conference&quot; and indescribing this line it referred to it as extending southwards &quot; east of Przemyl to the Carpa-thians &quot; \i.e., along &quot;Line A &quot; in Eastern Galicia). A little further on it proposed that in eastern Galicia each army should stand on the line it occupied at the date of the armistice.The document signed by the Polish delegate at Spa had referred merely to the line defined inthe Supreme Council&apos;s Declaration of 8th December, 1919, and had not mentioned any south-ward extension through Eastern Galicia.
