(44) 74.5th February, 1944.PROPOSALS FOR A NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE.Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction, the Minister of health and the Secretary of State for Scotland.THE War Cabinet Connnittees concerned with reconstruction have considered, in a series of meetings lasting over many months, detailed proposalsfor the National Health Service which the Government have promised toestablish.There have been differences of opinion among members of the Committee ona number of points. That was inevitable in the consideration of a scheme soextensive and so complex.The Reconstruction Committee have, however, agreed to recommend thescheme described in the attached prints :- (a) The draft of a White Paper; and(b) a memorandum explaining the White Paper proposals more shortly,which will be issued as a Stationery Office publication.At their last meeting the Reconstruction Committee agreed to make certain amendments in the text of both Papers. Most of these relate to points with whichwe need not trouble the War Cabinet. Certain questions of principle were also raised, however; and, with a view to meeting these, the Committee agreed torecommend the modifications set out in the Appendix to this Memorandum.We now submit the scheme for the approval of the War Cabinet.W.H.

INTRODUCTORY.The Government have announced that they intend to establish a com-prehensive health service for everybody in this country. They want to ensurethat in future every man and woman and child can rely on getting all theadvice arid treatment and care which they may need in matters of personal health; that what they get shall be the best medical and other facilities avail-able; that their getting these shall not depend on whether they can pay forthem, or on any other factor irrelevant to the real need-the real need being to bring the country&apos;s full resources to bear upon reducing ill-health and pro-promoting good health in all its citizens.A comprehensive health service was contemplated by the Beveridge Reporton Social Insurance and Allied Services. That Report founded its proposalsfor social security on three &quot; Assumptions &quot;. One of these Assumptions wasthat there would be a national health service, which &apos;&apos; will ensure that for every citizen there is available whatever medical treat-ment he requires, in whatever form he requires it, domiciliary or institutional,general, specialist or consultant and will ensure also the provision of dental,ophthalmic and surgical appliances, nursing and midwifery, and rehabilitation-tion after accidents.&quot;It was not the concern of the Report to say how this should be done.  It simplypointed out that it would need to be done, if the main proposals in regardto social security were to be able to be put into effect.But the comprehensive health service does not, of course, derive only from the proposals of the Beveridge Report. The idea of a full health and medical service for the whole population is not a completely new one, arisingonly as part of post-war reconstruction. In the long and continuous process by which this country has been steadily evolving its health services the stagehas been reached, in the Government&apos;s view, at which the single compre-hensive service for all should be regarded as the natural next development.The end of the war will present the opportunity, and plans for post-war recon-struction provide a setting, .but the proposal to set up a comprehensiveservice has to be seen against the past as well as the future and to be recognised as part of a general evolution of improved health services which has been going on in this country for generations. The case for it stands on its own merits, irrespective of the war or of other proposals for post-war reorganisation.It is not a question of a wholly new service, but of one with many rootsalready well established. The methods of organising it must be closely related to history and to past and present experience.The decision to establish the new service applies, of course, to Scotland aswell as to England and Wales and the&apos; present Paper is concerned with both countries. The differing circumstances of Scotland are bound to involvecertain differences of method and of organisation, although not of scope orof object. To draw distinctions throughout the Paper in regard to the detailed application of the new proposals in each country would unduly complicate the text. For this reason the principal differences which arise in applying theproposals to Scotland are reviewed all together, in chapter VII. Similarlymost of the Paper has, for convenience, to be expressed in terms (e.g. inits references to local authorities) which are not equally appropriate to both countries. Subject to the review of the main differences in chapter VII,these terms should normally be taken as covering whatever is their counter-part in Scotland. Throughout the Paper the appropriate Minister will be theMinister of Health for England and Wales and for Scotland the Secretary ofState, and references to the Minister should normally be so construed.
The purpose of the Paper is to examine the subject generally, to showwhat is meant by a comprehensive service and how it fits with what has beendone in the past or is being done in the present, and so to help people to look at the matter for themselves. The proposals made in the Paper (and summarised at the end of the Paper) represent what the Government believe to be the best means of bringing fhe service into effective operation. TheGovernment want these proposals to be freely examined and discussed. Theywill welcome constructive criticism of them, in the hope that the proposalswhich they will be submitting to Parliament may follow quickly and may be largely agreed.
I.THE PRESENT  SITUATION.The record of this country in its health and medical services is a goodone. The resistance of people to the wear and tear of four years of a second world war bears testimony to it. Achievements before the war in lowermortality rates,, in the gradual decline of many of the more serious diseases,in safer motherhood and healthier childhood, and generally in the prospectof a longer and healthier life all substantiate it. There is no question of having to abandon bad services and to start afresh. Reform in this fieldis not a matter of making good what is bad, but of making better what is good already.The present system has its origins deep in the history of the country&apos;ssocial services. Broadly, it is the product of the last hundred years, though some of its elements go much farther back. But most of the impetus- hasbeen gathered in the last generation or two, and it was left to the presentcentury to develop most of the personal health services as they are now known.This historical process, and the health services so far emerging from it,must be looked at in some detail if the present situation is to be understoodand if new proposals are to take proper account of it. There is, therefore,appended to this Paper (in Appendix A) a general survey of the medical and health services as they exist now, and of the way in which they came into being. Some features of the present services will also be discussed as they arise in later parts of this Paper, when the different branches of medical care -general, specialist, hospital and others are considered in more detail. Theimmediate question is how far the present arrangements are inadequate and what are the reasons for altering or adding to them.The main reason for change is that the Government believe that, at thisstage of social development, the care of personal health should be put on anew footing and be made available to everybody as a publicly sponsoredservice. Just as people are accustomed to look to public organisation for essential facilities like a clean and safe water supply or good highways,accepting these as things which the community combines to provide for thebenefit of the individual without distinction of section or group, so theyshould now be able to look for proper facilities for the care of their personal health to a publicly organised service available to all who want to use it a service for which all would be paying as taxpayers and ratepayers andcontributors to some national scheme of social security.In spite of the substantial progress of many years and the many goodservices built up under public authority and by voluntary and private effort, itis still not true to say that everyone can get all the kinds of medical and hospital service which he or she may require. Whether people can do sostill depends too much upon circumstance, upon where they happen to liveor work, to what group (e.g. of age, or vocation) they happen to belong, or what happens to be the matter with them. Nor is the care of health yet whollydivorced from ability to pay for it, although great progress has already beenmade in eliminating the financial barrier to obtaining most of the essential services. There is not yet, in short, a comprehensive cover for health pro-vided for all people alike. That is what it is now the Governmenfs intentionto provide.To take one very important example, the firstrline care of health foreveryone requires a personal doctor or a family doctor, a general medical practitioner available for consultation on all problems of health and sickness.At present, the National Health Insurance Scheme makes this provision for a
lar^e number of people; but it does not give ft to the wives and the children and the dependants. For extreme need, the older Poor Law still exists.For some particular groups, there are other facilities. But for something likehalf the population, the first-line health service of a personal medical adviserdepends on what private arrangements any particular person can manageto make.Even if a person has a regular doctor and this is not now assured to all there is no guaranteed link between that doctor and the rest of necessarymedical help. The doctor, both in private practice and in National HealthInsurance practice, has to rely on Irs own resources to introduce his patientto the right kinds of special treatment or clinic or hospital a great responsi-bility in these days of specialised medicine and surgery or the patient has tomake his own way to whatever local authority or other organisation happensto cater for his particular need.When a hospital&apos;s services are needed, it is far from true that everyonecan get all that is required. Here it is not so much a question of peoplenot being eligible to get the services which they need, as a matter of thepractical distribution of those services. The hospital and specialist services have grown up without a national or even an area plan. In one area theremay be already established a variety of hospitals. Another area, althoughthe need is there, may be sparsely served. One hospital may have a longwaiting list and be refusing admission to cases which another hospital not faraway could suitably accommodate and treat at once. There is undue pressure in some areas on the hospital out-patient departments -in spite of certainexperiments which some of the hospitals have tried (and which should be encouraged) in arranging a system of timed appointments to- obviate longwaiting. Moreover, even though most people have access to a hospital ofsome kind, it is not necessarily access to the right hospital. The tendency inthe modern development of medicine and surgery is towards specialist centres for radiotherapy and neurosis, for example and no one hospital can be equally equipped and developed to suit all needs, or to specialise equally inall subjects.* The time has come when the hospital services have to bethought of, and planned, as a wider whole, and the object has to- be that eachcase should be referred not to one single hospital which happens.to be &quot; local &quot;but to whatever hospital concentrates specially on that kind of case and can offer it the most up-to-date technique.Many services are also rendered by local authorities and others in specialclinics and similar organisations, designed for particular groups of the popula-tion or for particular kinds of ailment or medical care. These are, for themost part, thoroughly good in themselves, and they are used with advantageby a great many people in a great many districts. But, owing to the way .in which they have grown up piecemeal at different stages of history andunder different statutory powers, they are usually conducted as quite separate and independent services. There is no sufficient link either between these services themselves or between them and general medical practice and the hospitals.In short, general medical practice, consultant and specialist opinion,hospital treatment,  clinc services for particular purposes, home nursing,* Fracture treatment is a single example. It is now a highly specialised service,coupled with the modern aim of total rehabilitation and re-employment. A fracture maybe mended in a local hospital, and all the associations of habit and local interest mayfoster recourse to the local hospital in such cases. But the plain fact may be that tenor twenty miles away is a highly developed fracture centre, specialising in total rehabiti-tation of this kind of case, which the local people ought to be able regularly to use in preference to their &quot; own &quot; hospital. The difference between the facilities which the twohospitals can offer may determine whether or not the patient ultimately makes a fullrecovery from the effects of his injury.
midwifery and all other branches of health care need to be related to one another and treated as many aspects of the care of one person&apos;s health. that means that there has to be somewhere a new responsibility to relate them,if a service for health is to be given in future which will be not only compre-hensive and reliable but also easy to obtain.Last, but not least, personal health still tends to be regarded as something tobe treated when at fault, or perhaps to be preserved from getting at fault, butseldom as something to be positively improved and promoted and made fulland robust. Much of present custom and habit still centres on the idea thatthe doctor and the hospital and the clinic are the means of mending ill-healthrather than of increasing good health and the sense of well-being. Whilethe health standards of the people have enormously improved, and while there are gratifying reductions in the ravages of preventable disease, the plainfact remains that there are many men and women and children who could beand ought to be enjoying a sense of health and physical well-being which theydo not in fact enjoy. There is much sub-normal health still, which need notbe, with,a corresponding cost in efficiency and personal happiness.These are some of the chief deficiencies in the present arrangements which,in the view of the Government, a comprehensive health service should seek to make good.II.THE NEXT STAGE:A COMPREHENSIVE SERVICE FOR ALL.The idea of moving on to the next stage has been developing for some time.There is much agreement on what the aim should be, if not on the method of achieving it. The general idea of a fuller and better co-ordinated service hasbeen supported in most knowledgeable quarters professional and lay byofficial Commissions and Committees, by interested public or voluntary organ-isations and persons, in reports, in articles and in books, before the war and during it. Some reference to these is included in Appendix B, where a sum-mary is also given of the preliminary discussions and events which havepreceded the issue of this Paper.The method of approach.There are two possible ways of approaching the task. One, with allthe attraction of simplicity, would be to disregard the past and the presententirely and to invent ad hoc a completely new organisation for all healthrequirements. The other is to use and absorb the experience of the past and the present, building it into the wider service. The Government have adopted the latter method, as more in accord with native preference in thiscountry.There is a certain danger in making personal health the subject of a nationalservice at all. It is the danger of over-organisation, of letting the machinedesigned to ensure a better service itself stifle the chances of getting one. Yetmedical resources must be better marshalled for the full and equal service ofthe public, and this must involve organisation with public responsibilitybehind it. It is feasible to combine public responsibility and a fullservice with the essential elements of personal and professional freedom forthe patient and the doctor; and that is the starting point of this Paper&apos;sproposals. Throughout, the service must be based on the personal relation-ship of patient and doctor. Organisation is needed to ensure that the service is there, that it is there for all, and that.it is a good service; but organisationmust be seen as the means, and never for one moment as.the end.
Nor should there be any compulsion into the service, either for the patientor for the doctor. The basis must be that the new service will be there foreveryone who wants it-and indeed will be so designed that it can be looked upon as the normal method by which people get all the advice and help,vhich they want; but if anyone prefers not to use it, or likes to make private arrangements outside the service, he must be at liberty to do so. Similarly, ifany medical practitioner prefers not to take part in the new service and to relywholly on private work outside it, he also must be at liberty to do so.The scope of a &quot; comprehensive &quot; service.The proposed service must be &quot; comprehensive &quot; in two senses first, thatit is available to all people and, second, that it covers all necessary forms ofhealth care. The general aim has been stated at the beginning of this Paper.The service designed to achieve it must cover the whole field of medical advice and attention, at home, in the consulting room, in the hospital or thesanatorium, or wherever else is appropriate from the personal or family doctor to the specialists and consultants of all kinds, from the care of minorailments to the care of major diseases and disabilities. It must includeancillary services of nursing, of midwifery and of the other things which ought to go with medical care. It must secure first that everyone can besure of a general medical adviser to consult as and when the need arises, andthen that everyone can get access beyond the general medical adviser to more specialised branches of medicine or surgery. This cannot all be per-fected at a stroke of the pen, on an appointed day; but nothing less than this must be the object in view, and the framing of the service from the outset must be such as to make it possible.Temporary exceptions to &quot; comprehensiveness.&quot;For a time some aspects of the new service will be less complete than could be wished. A full dental service for the whole population, forinstance, including regular conservative treatment, is unquestionably a proper aim in any whole health service, and must be so regarded. But thereare not at present, and will not be for some years, enough dentists inthe country to provide it. Until the supply can be increased attention willhave to be concentrated on priority needs. These must include the needs ofchildren and young people and of expectant and nursing mothers. The wholedental problem is a peculiarly difficult one, and a Committee under the chair-manship of Lord Teviot has been set up by the two Health Ministers to consider and report on it.There may be similar (though perhaps less acute) difficulties in getting afull service in ophthalmology. But these, like the difficulties in dentistry, mustbe treated rather as practical problems arising in the operation of a new service than as matters of doubt in planning the service&apos;s scope and objectives.Mental health.The inclusion of the mental services also presents some difficulty,until a full re-statement of the law of lunacy and mental deficiency can beundertaken. Yet, despite the difficulty, the mental health services shouldbe included. The aim must be to reduce the distinctions drawn betweenmental ill-health and physical ill-health, and to accept the principle declared by the Royal Commission on Mental Disorder that &quot; the treatment of mentaldisorder should approximate as nearly to the treatment of physical ailmentsas is consistent with the special safeguards which are indispensable when the(       liberty of the subject is infringed.&quot;
Some misconceptions about the meaning of &quot; comprehensive.&quot;There is one common misconception about the meaning of a compre-hensive &apos;&apos;&apos; health service. Such a service emphatically has to comprehend allkinds of personal health treatment and medical advice. But that does not mean that there should be no other Government or private activity involving the use of the medical expert, or having any bearing upon health. Thereare many specialised and separate forms of undertaking such ^ as the supervision of industrial conditions-which may affect health and which may require the medicai expert as much as they require the engineering or thelegal or any other expert, but which cannot, simply for that reason, beregarded as necessarily part of the personal health service.The present system of factory medical inspection and the arrangementsmade for the employment by industry of &quot; works doctors &quot; (described in Appendix A) are cases in point. From the point of view ofindustrial organisation, of working conditions in factory, mine and field,there is a continuing and specialised need for enlisting medical skill in ensuring a proper working environment, a proper allocation of types of work to theindividual worker&apos;s capacity, a proper standard of working hygiene anda general protection of the worker&apos;s welfare. The enlistment of medical help for these purposes is part of the complex machinery of industrial organisationand welfare, and it belongs to that sphere more than to the sphere of the per-sonal doctor and the care of personal health which centres on the individual and his family and his home. What matters is that such specialised services,where they exist, should not impair the unity of personal health service onwhich he will rely; that, when a question arises of personal medical treatmentor consultation (beyond recognised incidental services of the kind described in Appendix A) perhaps first detected in work-place or factory this shouldbe regarded as a matter for the personal health service.Another example is that of the school medical service. Very similar considerations apply. It should be the part of any school medical arrange-ments to refer the school child for any and every form of personal doctoringto the general health service the family doctor and other resources which that service will provide. But that does not mean that as an integral partof the educational organisation the education authorities should not have theirown arrangements for looking after medical and welfare conditions in the schools, for maintaining inspection and supervision of the child in the schoolgroup and very usefully for encouraging parent and child to see thatfor personal treatment and advice the child resorts, whenever necessary, tothe family doctor and the full resources of the new health service.The proper continuance of environmental and preventive services in schooland industry should be coupled increasingly, as time goes on, with the habit of using for those services doctors who are also engaged in, the personal health service-so that there is a continuous blending of experience in bothkinds of work. With the bulk of the profession engaged, part-time or whole-time, in the new service, this process can be more readily accelerated andarrangements made for proper post-graduate training of general practitioners who are going to engage in industrial or other specialitiesappropriate to general practice. Similarly, while matters like industrial organisation ,require medical as well as other experts in the central departments of Government which deal with them, there is room, for a betterlinking of the expert staffs so engaged with the expert staffs whose time is wholly or mainly given to the personal health and treatment services.There is also another point on which it is necessary to be clear. Thesubject of health, in its broadest sense, involves not only medical services
but ali those environmental factors good housing, sanitation, conditionsin school and at work, diet and nutrition, economic security, and so on whichcreate the conditions of health and prepare the ground for it. All theseare fundamental; all of them must receive their proper place in the widerpattern of Government policy and of post-war reconstruction. But they arenot the subject of this particular Paper, which is concerned exclusively withthe direct services of personal health care and advice and treatment. no matter how successful the indirect influence of the environmental services may become in promoting good health and reducing sickness, there willremain a need for medical and nursing and hospital services.General nature of the Governmenfs proposals the rest of this Paper is concerned with the Governmenfs proposals for bringing the new comprehensive service into being. First, the administrative structure, central and local, will be considered. Then each of the mainbranches the hospital and consultant services, the general practitioner service,and the local clinic and other services will be discussed in some detail. after that, the special circumstances of the service in Scotland will be reviewed,and the Paper will end with a general summary of what is proposed.At this stage, therefore, before the more detailed part of the Paper begins, itmay make subsequent reading easier if the broad shape of the proposals is indicated.It is proposed that the new responsibility for providing the comprehensiveservice shall be put upon an organisation in which both central and localauthority take part, and which both centrally and locally is answerable to the public in the ordinary democratic manner. Central responsibilitywill lie with the Minister, local responsibility will lie with the major localgovernment authorities (the county and county borough councils) operatingfor some purposes severally over their existing areas and for other purposesjointly over larger areas formed by combination. Both at the centre andlocally, special new consultative bodies are proposed, for ensuring professionalguidance and the enlistment of the expert view. At the centre, in addition,a new and mainly professional body is to be created, to perform importantexecutive functions in regard to general medical practice in the new service.The mew joint authorities, i.e. the counties and county boroughs in combination, will be responsible (over suitable areas determined by theMinister after consulting the local interests) for assessing the needs of those areas in all branches of the new service and for planning generally how thoseneeds should best be met. They will do this in consultation with the localprofessional bodies referred to, and they will submit their proposed arrange-ments to the Minister for final settlement in each case.Then, when each area plan is settled, the joint authority will have the dutyof securing all the hospital and consultant services covered by it, by theirown provisions and by arrangements with the voluntary hospitals in the area,and they will for this purpose be responsible in future for the existing localauthority hospitals of all kinds. The individual county and county borough councils making up the joint authority will usually be responsible for localclinic and other services within the general framework of the plan, but therewill be special provision for the child welfare services to ensure a closerelation between them and child education. General medical practice inthe new scheme will be specially organised, largely as a national andcentralised service, but with proper links with the local organisation tc
relate it to the hospitals and to other branches of the service as a whole.There will be certain variations of these proposals for Scotland, to suit the differing circumstances there.The whole of the new service will be free of charge to all who takeadvantage of it (except for certain possible charges in respect of appliances)and the cost will be borne partly from exchequer funds, partly from local rates and partly from the contributions of the public under any scheme of social insurance which may be brought into operation. The voluntary hospitalswill take their own important part in the service as fully autonomous organisa-tions, under independent management as now, but observing certain general conditions which will be applied to all hospitals, voluntary or municipal alike.III.THE GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE structure of THE SERVICE.If people are to have a right to look to a public service for all their medicalneeds, it must be somebody&apos;s duty to sec that they do not look in vain. Theright to the service involves the corresponding duty to see that the service isprovided. Some organisation has to carry that duty, and as the service isto be publicly provided this involves responsible public authority in some form.CENTRAL AND LOCAL  RESPONSIBILITY.With the exception of medical benefit under the National Health Insurancescheme the public health services of this country have from the outset been administered by some form of local government organisation. In the caseof medical benefit the administrative body the Insurance Committee thoughoperating over a local area, the county or county borough, is not answer-able to a local electorate but consists in the main of persons representingApproved Societies which are non-territorial units. Apart from this excep-tion, in a long series of Public Health Acts and similar measures parliament has placed the prime responsibility for providing the health services hospitals,institutions, clinics, domiciliary visiting, and others on local, rather thancentral, authority. This system recognises that, in intimate and. personal services of this kind, local factors such as distribution of population, transport facilities, the nature of local employment and vocation (and generally localtradition and habit) have a profound- influence on detailed planning.The absorption of the existing services into a comprehensive service doesnot materially alter this situation. To uproot the present system and to putinto the hands of some central authority the direct administration of the new service, transferring to it every institution and every piece of present Organisa-tion, would run counter to the whole historical development of the health services; and from a practical point of view a step of this kind would certainly not contribute to the successful and early introduction of the new service.Changes, some of a drastic kind, in the present organisation of local areas andadministrative bodies will be necessary. For reasons discussed later theorganisation of the services of general practitioners will call for a higher degreeof central control than other parts of the service. But there is no case fordeparting generally from the principle of local responsibility, coupled withenough central direction to obtain a coherent and consistent national serviceCENTRAL  ORGANISATION.Central responsibility must rest with a Minister of the Crown, answerabledirectly to Parliament and through Parliament to the people.   The suggestion
has been made that, while this principle should be accepted, there is a case for replacing the normal departmental machinery by some specially con-stituted corporation or similar body (perhaps largely made up of membersof the medical profession) which would, under the general auspices of a minister, direct and supervise the service. The exact relation of this pro-posed body to its Minister has never been defined, and it is here that thecrux lies. If in matters both of principle and detail decision normallyrested in the last resort with the Minister, the body would in effect be a new department of Government no less than (say) the National Health InsuranceCommission, which was later replaced by the Ministry of Health, or thepresent Board of Control or Prison Commission. If, on the other hand,certain decisions were removed from the jurisdiction of the Minister (andconsequently from direct Parliamentary control) there would be need to definewith the utmost precision what those decisions were. Clearly they could not include major questions of finance. Nor could any local government authori-ties responsible for local planning or administration reasonably be asked tosubmit to being over-ruled by a body not answerable to Parliament.Nevertheless, the Government recognise that the provision of a health ser-vice involves technical issues of the highest importance and that in its administration, both centrally and locally, there is room for special devicesto secure that the guidance of the expert is available and does not gounheeded. Otherwise the quality of the service is bound to suffer. they also recognise that, in a service which will affect the professional life of almost every doctor, there is need within the administrative structure for somelargely professional body which can concern itself with the professional welfare of doctors who take part in the service. The proposals which follow are designed to meet this situation.Central Responsibility of the Minister.There will be direct responsibility to Parliament, therefore, resting onthe Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland, respectively,as the Ministers of the Crown concerned with the health of the people.A Central Health Services Council.At the side of the Minister, but independent of him, there will be created a special professional and expert body.&apos; It might be called the CentralHealth Services Council, and it will be a statutory body.Its function will be to express the expert view on any general technicalaspect of the service. There cannot be dual responsibility for the service andso it will be consultative and advisory, and not executive. It will be entitledto advise, not only on matters referred to it by the Minister, but on any matters within its province on which it feels it right to express its expertopinion, and the Minister quite apart from any other publication of theCouncil&apos;s views and proceedings which he may from time to time make will be required to submit to Parliament annually a report on the CounciFswork during the year. The Minister, in addition to the regular and generalconsultation which he will obviously want to maintain with such a body,will refer to it in draft form any general regulations which he proposes to.make in the new service on subjects within its expert field.The constitution of such a body&apos;, given statutory recognition as the mouth-piece of expert opinion in&apos;the central administration, will obviously need to beconsidered carefully and in detail with the professional and other organisations concerned. At this stage only the general kind of constitution which mightsuit its purpose and function can be suggested.It will, it is assumed, be primarily medical in its make-up, becausethe main technical aspects of the health service in all its branches will be
medical. But it will not be wholly medical; it will need to be% able toprovide an expert view on many questions e.g. of hospital administration,nursing, dentistry, pharmacy and auxiliary services which will involveother experts than the physician or surgeon. Yet, to be effective, it mustnot be too large and unwieldy; nor could much of its varied work be regu-larly done by the single full Council. The Council itself might consist of aboutthirty or forty members, representing the main medical organisations (specialistand general), the voluntary and municipal hospitals (with both medical andlay representation), and professions like dentistry, pharmacy and nursing. Forany of its special purposes the Council could establish small groups or sub-committees, on each of which it would be open to it to introduce additionalexperts in the particular subject referred the Council itself, however, retain-ing an ultimate single responsibility for all views or advice expressed in itsname.The members will be appointed by the Minister in consultation with the professional and other organisations concerned, and the Council will selectits own chairman and regulate its own procedure. The Minister will beprepared to provide a secretariat, and the expenses of the Council will bemet from public funds.Central Medical Board.There will also be set up, for.certain specific purposes, a Central medical board. This will be in a different cateogry from the Central health services Council, inasmuch as it will perform executive functions in theday-to-day working of the general practitioner service, rather than voiceopinion on general matters of medical policy.It is mentioned here only to complete the picture of the central organisa-tion. Its duties and its constitution will need to be referred to in chapter V, whenthe participation of doctors in the. service and the terms and conditions of thatparticipation are considered.LOCAL ORGANISATION.Local organisation is inevitably more complex. The new service has toinclude hospitals and institutional services for the sick in general, for mentalcases, for infectious diseases and tuberculosis, for maternity and for everygeneral and special hospital subject. It has to include the many kinds of serviceusually provided in local clinics, a family doctor service and many ancillary services nursing, health visiting, midwifery and others. It ranges from theone extreme of highly specialised services, requiring relatively few centres forthe country as a whole, to the other extreme of services involving a largenumber of local clinics and arrangements for care in the individual home.Suggestions have been made for a completely new kind of local or&quot; regional &quot; authority sometimes proposed as a vocational or technical body(like the special kind of central organisation already mentioned). In so faras those suggestions would conflict with the principle of public responsiblity,they need not be considered here. Both the principles applied to central organisation that of democratic responsibility and that of full professionalguidance must be equally applied to local organisation.Service to be based on local goverment.The present local government system amply embodies the former of these principles that of democratic responsibility and the existing local authoritiesare already responsible for many kinds of personal health service which will need to be incorporated in the new and wider service in future. It is certainlyno part of the Government&apos;s intention to supersede and to waste these good
existing resources, or needlessly to interfere with the well-tested machinery oflocal government as it is already known; nor would the record and experienceof the existing local authorities in the personal health services justify such acourse. On the contrary the Government propose to take as the basis of thelocal administration of the new service the county and county borough councils.But there are some requirements of the new service which the county and county borough councils cannot fulfil if they continue to act separately, eachfor its independent area; and changes will be necessary. &quot; In particular, forthe future hospital service, it will be essential to obtain larger local areasthan at present, both for planning and administration. The special needs ofthis service can be considered first.Need for larger administrative areas for the hospital service.Broadly speaking the hospital services, so far as they are publicly providednow, are in the hands of the county and county borough councils, with theexception of isolation hospitals for infectious disease in the counties. Theareas of counties and county boroughs vary enormously ranging (withoutcounting London) from Rutland and Canterbury, with populations of some18,000 and 26,000 respectively, to Middlesex and Birmingham with populations of over 2,000,000 and 1,000,000.It would be theoretically possible to put upon the council of each county and county borough the duty to provide, or to arrange with other agencies for,the whole range of hospital services. This would impose responsibility for theservices on authorities many of which lack the size and resources and adminis-trative organisation to plan and conduct and pay for the service. What is moreimportant, it would leave untouched the demarcation between town and country which is reflected in the system of administrative counties and county boroughs,but which has no meaning in relation to hospital services. The towns largelyserve the country in the matter of hospitals. If for purposes of hospitaladministration they are kept apart by continuing the separate county and county borough basis, the result will be a complicated criss-cross pattern of&quot; customer &quot; arrangements, since in most areas (particularly those of counties)it will be out of the question to secure the whole range of service or eventhe bulk of it-inside the area boundary. These &quot; customer &quot; arrangements will in turn involve complicated administrative arrangements and a mass of financial adjustments between different areas. Alternatively, if the provisionof, a complete service within each area were attempted, the resulting system would run counter to the whole conception of an ordered pattern of hospital accommodation and could only lead to wasteful competition in hospital building.The need for larger areas has long been recognised by local authorities himany branches of hospital administration. The many combinations already in existence make this clear; and the very existence of these combinationswould in itself give rise to great administrative difficulties if it were decidedthat the new hospital service as a whole was to be in the hands only of theindividual county and county borough councils in future.The essential needs of a reorganised hospital service, based on a new publicduty to provide it in all its branches, are these (a) The organising area needs to cover a population and financial resourcessufficient for an adequate service to be secured on an efficient and economicalbasis.(b) The area needs to be normally of a kind where town and country re-quirements can be regarded as blended parts of a single problem, andcatered for accordingly., (c) The area needs to be so defined as to allow of most of the varied hos-pital and specialist services being organised within its boundaries (leaving for inter-area arrangement only a few specialised services).
In the majority of the areas of existing authorities none of the three condi-tions would be met.It is therefore necessary to decide what the form of authority for theselarger hospital areas should be. On this, various alternatives are examined in Appendix C to this Paper. The course most convenient and indeed, inthe Governments view, the only course possible at the present time will beto create the larger area authorities by combining for this purpose the existingcounty and county borough councils, in joint boards operating over areas to be settled by the Minister after consultation with local interests at the outset of the scheme. There will be some exceptional cases (the. county of london is the most obvious) where no combination is necessary at all; in such casesan existing authority will fulfil both its own functions and those of the new form of authority but this will be unusual. Where the new form of joint authority is referred to in the rest of this Paper it should be taken as including any individual council which, in such exceptional circumstances may be acting in the two capacities.While both planning and administration will usually need to be based onlarger areas, this does not mean that a standard-sized area need be, or-canbe, prescribed for the hospital services. Local conditions distribution of population, natural trends to various main centres of treatment, geography,transport and accessibility must determine the size and shape of theoptimum area. Sometimes simple combination of a county with the county boroughs within its boundary (i.e. the geographical county as a unit) will besufficient; sometimes, the linking of two or three small counties will be needed,sometimes other variations.Special mention should be made of the isolation hospitals for infectious diseases, because in the counties these hospitals are with few exceptions ownedand administered by the minor authorities and not by the county councils, andtherefore a decision to transfer them to the new joint authority will not onlyremove them from their present owners (as with the hospitals of the counties and county boroughs) but will prevent their present owners from retainingeven the part interest in them which membership of the new joint authority will afford in the case of the counties and county boroughs. (It is, of course,not practicable to give direct representation on the joint authority to theseminor authorities, without at once duplicating the representation of all localgovernment electors who happen to live in a county and not in a countyborough.) The case for this absolute transfer of the isolation hospitals hasnothing to do with the past record of the minor authorities, nor is it in anyway a reflection upon the quality of the work which they have hitherto done.The whole trend of medical opinion has for some time been in favour of treatingthese hospitals, not primarily as places for the reception of patients to preventthe spread of infection, but as hospitals where severe and complicated casesof infectious disease can receive expert treatment and nursing. The smallisolation hospital of the past century is not only uneconomic in days of rapidtransport but cannot reasonably be expected to keep abreast of modernmethods. One result of the new outlook will be the development, in additionto the larger isolation hospital serving the densely populated area, of accom-modation for infectious diseases in blocks forming part of the general hospitals. .These considerations all indicate that the infectious disease hospitals must infuture form part of the general hospital system.-It may be, as time goes on, that for certain specialised hospital functionsthere is room for the development of a few particular centres which would serve national rather than local needs. In this field there may be a,case for direct provision or arrangement by the Government centrally. But such provision or arrangement would be special and.exceptional and need not beconsidered here as part of the normal organisation of the new service.
nAs will be seen, when the hospital services are fully considered in chapter IV,the function of the new joint authorities will be to secure a complete hospital and consultant service of all kinds for each of the new and larger areas partly1 by their own direct provision and partly by arrangement with voluntary hospitals, and all on the basis of an area hospital plan which they willformulate in consultation with the hospitals and others concerned, and whichwill require the Ministers final settlement and approval. The existing powersand duties of the present local authorities in regard to hospital services including tuberculosis, infectious diseases and mental health will pass to thejoint authorities, together with the existing hospitals and other institutionsconcerned.The place of the joint authority outside the hospital service.Outside the hospital and consultant services that is, in the kinds of serviceappropriately given in local clinics and similar premises, or by domiciliaryvisiting (like midwifery or home-nursing) the case for centralising alladministration in the one authority over the larger area is not the same, and itis the Governments view that there should be as little upsetting of the exist-ing organisation for these services as is compatible with achieving a unifiedhealth service for all. It will not be enough, however, simply to leave allthese separate services exactly as they are now. What is essential is that,although still locally conducted &quot;with all the advantages of local knowledge and enthusiasm, they should be regarded in future as the related parts of a wider whole and should fit in with all the other branches of a comprehensiveservice in their planning and their distribution. For this purpose it mustbe the single responsibility of some authority to plan the whole, although not necessarily to provide the parts, and the obvious authority to do this from the point of view both of its area of operation and of its constitution willbe the new joint authority.The new joint authority will therefore be charged to examine the general needs of the area from the point of view of the health service as a whole not only in the hospital services for which it will itself be responsible butalso in these more local services. It will have the duty of producing,in consultation with the local authorities and others concerned, an areaarrangement or plan for a related service of all kinds and this will need the approval of the Minister. - But, within the general framework of the approved plan, the provision and administration of most of the local services including some new kinds of service will normally rest with the individualcounty and county borough councils, and the joint authority will be con-cerned only to watch that the general area arrangement proves to be theright one when put into actual operation, that in fact it works out as intended,and that any subsequent additions to it, or amendments of it, which seemsto be required are put in hand and submitted to the Minister.There are, however, some forms of local clinic service which although pro-vided in separate premises so as to make their facilities more accessible arein essence out-patient activities of the hospital and consultant services; ofwhich, in fact, the essential feature needs to be treatment and advice at theconsultant and specialist level, provided by the same consultants and specialistsas serve the hospitals or sanatoria and are based on them. Obvious examples are the tuberculosis dispensaries, mental clinics and cancer diagnostic centres.This kind of service must usually be the responsibility of the same authority as is responsible for the hospitals and consultants over the larger area_the&quot;outpost &quot;service going with the parent service of which it ought to be part.   They differ in this respect from the other local services which belongi     more to the general practitioner sphere the maternity and child welfare clinics,
school medical services, clinics for general dental or ophthalmic treatment and advice, arrangements for midwifery or home nursing or health visiting, and similar activities. These certainly need to be linked with the consultantsand the hospitals for difficult cases (as the area plan will provide), but theydo not&apos;have to be directly administered with the hospitals, and the counties and county boroughs are normally appropriate areas for their operation.One case requires special mention. The Local Government Act of1929 initiated the policy of securing that local child welfare and educationresponsibilities should be brought closer together, and that the local educationauthority in each area should as often as possible be the welfare authority.In the view of the Government the time has come to carry that policy toits full conclusion. The destination of the present welfare functions (now exercised partly by county and county borough councils, partly by other localauthorities within the counties) will therefore depend upon the decisions taken by Parliament upon the educational functions of these various authori-ties under the current Education Bill. When the relationship between thecounty and county borough councils and the minor authorities inregard to education has been settled, something on broadly similar lines canbe adopted as the arrangement between these authorities in regard to child welfare. This does not mean, however, that this service will be excludedfrom the general area planning of the health services by the new joint autho-rity.  It affects only the local operation of the service.In dealing with the clinic and other local services generally it will notbe wise to prescribe an absolutely hard-and-fast rule to be applied in all circumstances. It may be that in a particular county or county borough ofexceptionally small area or resources a case for transferring local functions tothe larger joint authority will be overwhelming, in the interests of an efficientservice. In another area, for some particular local reason, even somp of thedispensary or out-patient functions just described as belonging properly to thehospital and consultant sphere may be found more suitable for dischargeby an individual county or county borough. A rigid and universal rule aboutthe allocation of the various services would preclude a good common-sensearrangement on which all were agreed in a particular case. For reasonableflexibility, the detailed allocation of services will be left to be finally settledas best suits each case, but- observing the general demarcation described inthe absence of any exceptional reason to do otherwise.This can be achieved in the following way. The new joint authority, in preparing its arrangement or plan for the whole health service of its area andsubmitting it to the Minister, will include proposals as to the exact allocation of responsibility for providing the various local services covered -he., proposals as to which services should be provided by the county and county borough councils severally and which in combination through the joint authority itself.In all cases the hospital and consultant services will be required to be thejoint authority&apos;s responsibility; in all ca&apos;ses the child welfare service will berequired to- lie with the same authorities as carry responsibility for educationunder the new Education Bill; in between these two fixed points the allocation of clinic and other local services can vary to suit exceptional needs, but with the normal rule as stated above those services which belong essentially tothe consultant sphere, like tuberculosis dispensaries, going to the joint autho-rity, while those which do not will rest with the several counties and county boroughs making up that joint authority. The decision, as in other proposalsof the area plan, will rest finally with the Minister in each case.Special considerations will apply to the &quot; family doctor &quot; or general practitioner branch of the new service, which is reviewed in detail in chapter V.   The organisation there suggested will be one which is largely j
central and national arid only partly local. Those main aspects of theservice which affect the individual practitioner including the terms of hisparticipation in the service, the protection of his professional interests and the&quot;eneral personal relationship of the doctor to the new public service willbe governed by central arrangements applicable to the country as a whole.On the other hand it is not proposed that there shall be any question of exclud-ihg this branch of the health service from the concern of the new joint authorities to plan, with the Minister, for the requirements of their areas,and the locally planned arrangement of the new service will in each case have regard to resources and needs in the sphere of general practice as wellas in hospital and other facilities.Apart from these local functions in the general practitioner service, therewill also be the provision and maintenance of special Health Centres forthe grouped medical practice of some of the doctors in the new service, in areas where it is decided to try this form of practice. This, as a functionnot belonging to the hospital and consultant sphere, will be appropriate to theindividual county and county borough councils.General.An important task, therefore, of the new joint authorities will be to unifyand to co-ordinate the service. They will be the instrument through which,with the Minister, a rational and effective plan for all branches of the health service in their respective areas is secured. It will be their responsibility tosee that their proposals provide for all that the inhabitants of their areas will require, to submit the proposals to the Minister as an area plan for final settlement, and subsequently to keep the plan up to date as requirementsdevelop and to bring before the Minister any necessary changes if the plan isfound not to be working out in the manner designed. They will not them-selves provide and operate all the services for which the approved area planprovides; nor is there any need for them to do so. They will usuallyadminister themselves only those branches of the service which demanddirect administration over the larger area as a whole, and not those whichcan suitably be administered (when once a unified plan is settled) on a morelocalised basis. In short, the existing major local authorities will combine tosecure, with the Minister, a unified general plan of the whole service for theirgrouped areas; they will then combine to carry out those parts of this plan which demand a single administration over all their areas together; butthey will be charged individually to carry out those parts which can be separately and locally administered.Professional guidance in local organisation.In order to secure good professional guidance in the local administrationof the new service a special local professional organisation will be established to advise and guide and, if necessary, to initiate new suggestions.Local Health Services Councils.The need to ensure technical guidance by creating special professional andexpert bodies for the purpose offers scope for innovation in local governmentmethod and justifies it. What is wanted is that there should be, ineach area, some new provision for the organised expression of the viewsof the expert and for ensuring that the local administration can get thefullest advantage from it. The simplest way will be to apply to local administration the kind of consultative machinery suggested for central administration; i.e. to have in each case a local expert technical body, whichmight be known as the Local Health Services Council.
The purpose of these bodies will be to provide locally the same kind of medium for expressing the expert point of view on technical aspects of theservice as has been proposed at the centre. The appropriate area for eachwill be the larger areas of the new joint authorities already discussed. their functions will be not only to advise on matters referred to them by the joint authorities or other local authorities in the area, but also to initiate advice onany matters within their expert province on which they think it right to do&apos; so and, if they wish, to submit their views and advice not only to the joint authority or other local authorities concerned with the matters in question,but to the Minister. Apart from its ordinary consultation, the joint authority will be required to consult them on the area plan for the local health service which it submits to the Minister, and on subsequent material alterations oradditions to that plan.The constitution and membership of these bodies will call for detailed consideration later. Provided that all the professional interests are fairlyrepresented, there is no reason why the pattern should be precisely uniformthroughout the country and the most convenient course will probably be toprovide for the matter by way of local schemes approved by the Minister.Direct professional representation on local authorities.It is sometimes suggested that the best method of linking the expert pointof view with the direct administration of the service would be to include inthe local administrative authorities themselves, and in their committees, a pro-portion of professional members appointed for the purpose by the appropriateprofessional organisations with or without voting powers. Arguments canbe adduced both for and against a system of this kind, but on balance theGovernment feel that the risk of impairing the principle of public responsi-bility that effective decisions on policy must lie entirely with elected representatives answerable to the people for the decisions that they take-outweighs any advantages likely to accrue.IV.HOSPITAL AND CONSULTANT SERVICES.The term &quot; hospital services &quot; is used in this Paper to include all formsof institutional care of every kind of sickness and injury. It comprises the whole range of general and special hospitals, including infectious disease hospitals,sanatoria for tuberculosis, accommodation for maternity cases and for the chronic sick, and for rehabilitation; and it comprises also the usual ancillaryhospital services for pathological examinations, X-ray, electro-therapy,ambulances and other purposes. Out-patient ho less than in-patient treat-ment is included. It will be the aim to restore the out-patient work of the hospitals as much as possible to its proper field of specialist and consultant care,when the existence of a general &quot; family doctor &quot; for all has been secured.The mental hospitals and mental deficiency institutions have also to beincluded in the scope of the hospital and consultant part of the new service,under the care of the new joint authorities. They will present many problemsof their own, calling for some degree of special organisation to fitthem. The present general review does not attempt to deal with this specialsubject, and the discussion which follows is directed mainly to the more general range of hospital and consultant services although much of it canobviously be applied to the mental health services as well.The present hospital services are described in Appendix A. They presenttwo main problems.   The first is to bring together over suitable areas the
activities of the various separate and independent hospitals, to ensure thatall the different kinds of special and general hospital treatment are so linkedthat the individual can get the best of each. The second is to enable thetwo quite different hospital systems (the voluntary hospitals and the municipalhospitals) to join forces in future in a single service.The proposed joint authority, operating over a large area, has. been described. It will be that authority&apos;s responsibility, with the Minister, tosee that a full hospital service of all kinds is available for people in its area.Rut the authority neither will, nor will need to, provide the whole service itself.The part of the voluntary hospital.The conception of a public authority discharging its duty by contractingwith others for the provision of services has long been familiar. As early as 1875 local authorities were enabled both to provide hospitals themselves and to enter into agreements with other hospitals for the reception of people from their district. Later legislation followed similar lines; in recent Actsdealing with special services (e.g., the Midwives Act, 1936, the Cancer Act,1039) the use of voluntary agencies has been clearly contemplated. There arealready large numbers of agreements under which existing local authoritiesarrange for accommodation in hospitals, sanatoria, dispensaries, or clinics,sometimes belonging to other local authorities and sometimes to voluntaryagencies. , j^The facts of the existing accommodation in voluntary and municipalhospitals (given in Appendix A) make it clear that without the collaboration ofthe voluntary hospitals it would be many years before the new joint authorities could build up a system adequate for the needs of the whole population; sothat, from that point of view alone, the co-operation of the voluntary hospitalsis a necessity. But the matter cannot be regarded -from that point of viewalone. The voluntary hospital movement not only represents the oldestestablished hospital system of the country, but it attracts the active personalinterest and support of a large number of people who believe in it as a socialorganisation and who wish to see it maintained side by side with the hospitalswhich are directly provided out of public funds. It is not merely that the best of the voluntary hospitals have, in a degree so far unsurpassed, developedspecialist and general hospital resources which they will be able at once tomake available, while most of the rest of the voluntary hospitals have experi-ence and an existing, organisation which it will be obviously sensible to enlist.It is certainty not the wish of the Government to destroy or to diminish asystem which is so well rooted in the good will of its supporters.Yet the acceptance by the community of responsibility for a service forall might affect fundamentally the position of the voluntary hospitals.A new universal public hospital service might have the gradual effect ofundermining the foundations on which the voluntary hospitals are based,if this is not to happen, a way has to be found of combining the general responsibility of the new joint authority for the service with the continuedparticipation in that service of the voluntary movement as such; a way,in fact, of securing&apos;a whole service under one ultimate public responsibilitywithout destroying the independence and traditions to which the voluntary hospitals attach value. The Government believe that this can be done, andin settling the details arising out of the following proposals they will welcome the help and the suggestions of&apos; the voluntary hospital representatives in securing it.Preparation of local area plan.The joint authority&apos;s first task will be to assess in detail thehospital needs of its area and the hospital resources available to its area.
This it will do in close consultation with the local expert body,the Local Health Services Council. It is hoped that the hospital surveys,referred to in Appendix B and now nearing completion, will be of valuablehelp in this.The authority&apos;s next task, again in consultation with the local expertbody and with other local interests (including the voluntary hospitals con-cerned) will be to work out a plan of hospital arrangements for its area,based on using, adapting and, where necessary, supplementing existing resources. The object of the plan will be to arrive at &quot;the right quantities,kinds and distribution of hospital facilities for the area; to settle where, how,and by what hospitals, each necessary branch of hospital treatment can best besecured, to produce a balanced scheme in which all the necessary specialistfacilities in medicine and surgery (including fracture and orthopaedic, gynaeco-logical, paediatric, ophthalmic, psychiatric and others) are provided in dueproportion, together with general accommodation for cases, acute or chronic,of the ordinary type. The plan must ensure that the various special treat-ments are concentrated in centres competent and convenient to provide them,and not dispersed haphazard in uneconomic and overlapping units; that properlinking of services is secured by relating the work of special and general hospitals; that arrangements are at hand for the transfer of patients to the hospitals best suited to their medical needs; and that the skill of the consultantstaffs of the various hospitals taking part can be used to the maximumadvantage of the area as a whole.It will be the aim of the authority to make its area (which will have been determined with this in view) as self-sufficient as possible in hospital and con-sultant services. - But where it is obviously more sensible, as in some of therarer services, the plan will provide for certain services by agreed arrange-ments outside the area.The basis of the plan will be that the joint authority will securethe necessary service for its area partly through its own hospitals and institu-tions, partly through contractual arrangements made with voluntary hospitalsfor the performance of agreed services set out in the plan, to a minor degree(where necessary) through arrangements with the joint authorities of other areas.Central approval of local area plans.The plan will then be submitted to the Minister for approval, and will haveno validity until so approved. The Minister, able to look at the country as awhole and at the effect of the local plans one upon another, will have power tomodify or supplement the plan before giving his approval. He will considerall objections or representations made to him by local organisations (includingthe Local Health Services Council), voluntary hospitals or others.&apos; The plan, when approved, will be open to amendment at any time, and theMinister will be empowered to call on the joint authority to reconsider theplan and submit fresh proposals. The procedure for amending the plan willbe the same as for its original preparation and will include all necessary localconsultation.No voluntary hospital will be compelled to participate. Its participation will rest on a contract between it and the joint authority to provide the servicesspecified in the plan. Where it agrees to participate, it will like each of theauthority&apos;s own hospitals have to observe certain general conditions, just as itwill obtain certain advantages.General conditions to be observed by hospitals.These conditions will be settled centrally, for the country as a whole, andthey will then become the conditions on which exchequer grant will be payable.
In framing the conditions the Minister will seek the advice of the Central health services Council; but the more important conditions will relate to subjects suchas the following:  .(a) each hospital will be required to maintain the services which underthe terms of the approved hospital plan it undertakes to maintain, and generally to comply with the terms of the plan;(b) each hospital will observe certain national requirements such asthe Rushcliffe or Taylor rates and conditions for its nursing staff;(c) in appointing senior medical and surgical staff each hospital willconform with any national arrangements which may be adopted for regulate-mg appointments and remuneration;(d) each hospital will be open to visiting and inspection, in respect ofits part in the public service, under arrangements laid down centrally;(e) in the case of voluntary hospitals some conditions to secure reasonableuniformity in the keeping of accounts and in the matter of audit will prob-ably be necessary so far as they take part in the new service. The presenta-tion of accounts of municipal hospitals is already largely subject to centraldirection.Financial arrangements with voluntary hospitals.As already emphasised, it is the aim of the Government to enable the voluntary hospitals to take their important part in the service without lossof identity or autonomy. But it is essential to this conception that the hospitals should still look substantially to their own financial resources, to personal bene-factions and the continuing support of those who believe in the voluntaryhospital movement. So long, and so long only, can they retain their indi-viduality. If once the situation were to arise in.which the whole cost of the voluntary hospitals&apos; part in the public service (a service designed for the whole population) was repaid from public money, or indeed in which it was recognisedthat public funds were to be used to guarantee those hospitals&apos; financial security,-the end of the voluntary movement would be near at hand.On this footing, the financial relation between the joint authority andthe individual voluntary hospital must be that of an agreement to pay a specified sum in return for services rendered or to be rendered, and thisshould not be assessed as a total reimbursement of costs incurred. Whetherthe sum will be calculated in terms of beds or occupied beds, or otherwise,is for the moment immaterial. In order to avoid a large number of individualbargains, and the risk of competitive bargaining leading to undesirable results,it will be convenient for standard payments, in respect of different kinds of hospital service which involve different levels of expense, to be settledcentrally. These payments will be made by the joint authorities and will fall on local rates, assisted by exchequer grant.In addition, both the municipal and the voluntary hospitals will receive a direct grant from central funds which will include the share, attributable to hospital services, of any sum allocated towards the cost of the comprehensivehealth service from the contributions of the public to any scheme of social insurance. So far as this sum represented contributions by potential patients of hospitals it could fairly be said that the Government would have collectedmoney which might otherwise have been paid to the hospitals direct, and thatthe proposed grant would thus restore the balance. This grant could bebased on the number of beds provided by each, hospital, but in thecase of voluntary hospitals it would be feasible, if so desired, to regard theaggregate of their share of the payments as a central pool from which payments to individual hospitals could be varied according to the needs and resourcesof each.In either case it will be the Ministers responsibility to see that the con-ditions of the grant are fulfilled. If the idea of a variable grant to the voluntary
hospitals is adopted, the Minister will be prepared to be guided in questionsof relative need by some suitable body representing the hospitals, though thefinal responsibility and decision must remain with him.Special considerations apply to&apos;hospitals used-for the clinical teaching of medical students, and the question of the appropriate form of financialassistance to these hospitals will need to be reviewed when the report is available of the Committee on Medical Schools now sitting under the chairman-ship of Sir William Goodenough.Inspection of hospitals.In a service of this magnitude, in which hundreds of hospitals underdifferent and independent managements will be taking part, the problemof inspection is a difficult one. Apart from special inspection in cases of difficulties arising or changes in contemplation, routine inspections at not too frequent intervals would serve the double purpose of bringing to notice-defects of organisation or management and, what is equally important, of enabling individual hospitals to be kept in touch with the latest practice and ideas. The foundation of any inspectorate must clearly be a team of highly qualified medical men, but the inspectors need not all be persons&apos;employed whole-time on this work; from many points of view there areadvantages in employing on a part-time basis medical men&apos; or women of dis-tinction in various branches of professional work or medical administration.In addition to doctors, there is scope for experts of various kinds for dealingwith an organisation so varied and complex as a modern hospital.   Hospitaladministrators, accountants, nurses, engineers, catering and kitchen experts_to mention no others should find a place.A solution would be the appointment by the Minister of a body of persons of the types mentioned, some of whom would be on a whole-time and otherson a part-time basis. These appointments could be made with the advice of the Central Health Services Council and for convenience those appointedmight be grouped in suitable panels operating over different areas of thecountry. The selection of the part-time doctors could be partly from those associated with consultant practice and voluntary hospitals and partly fromthose with experience of municipal hospitals, as in the case of those who arealready conducting on the Minister&apos;s behalf the survey of hospital resourcesreferred to in Appendix B. In cases of importance the inspectors could, againlike the hospital surveyors, work in pairs.The system of inspection must take account of the fact that the new joint authorities, no less than the Minister, will have a responsibility for thehospital service as a whole in their respective areas. The arrangements are intended to serve the double purpose. Inspectors&apos; reports on any hospitalwill be available- both to the Ministry and to the joint authority, and itwill be open to the latter to ask for a special inspection if it thinks itdesirable. Where in the past contractual arrangements have been made between a local authority and a voluntary hospital, special provision has notuncommonly been made for a right of entry for the authority&apos;s medical officer.There would be nothing to prevent similar arrangements being locally agreedunder the system now proposed, but normally a more general system of thekind described will better serve the purpose in view.Provision for consultant services in the local plan.A main object of the new arrangements will be to ensure all kinds ofconsultant and specialist advice and treatment to all who need it. This partof the service will be best and most naturally based on the hospital sendees,in the wide sense in which these have been defined.
This means that it will become one of the duties of the joint authorityto ensure that, through the various hospitals taking part, there will be pro-vided an adequate consultant service available to all general practitionersin the service. It will do this, as in other branches of the hospital service,partly by its own direct arrangement and partly by contracting with the voluntary hospitals. In the latter case it will be for the authority to agreewith a voluntary hospital for the provision by the latter of consultant servicesboth at the hospital and where necessary by visits to a clinic or health centre or the patients home. The hospital will itself enter into the necessaryengagements with the consultants and specialists concerned. The local servicepayments to the hospitals, already mentioned, can be based on the assump-tion of a consultant staff properly remunerated to enable the hospital to fulfil the tasks which it had undertaken to perform.Some principles affecting consultant services.Before proposing in detail the form of a consultant service the Governmentare awaiting the report of Sir William Goodenoughs Committee on medical schools. But it is clear that there are certain general considerations of which account must be taken in devising the new service.The need is twofold more consultants, and a better distribution of them.Apart from distribution, there are not yet enough men and women of realconsultant status and one of the aims will be to encourage more doctors ofthe right type to enter this arm of medicine or surgery and to provide themeans for their training. As to distribution, the need is for a more evenspread. The main consultant facilities now are inevitably concentrated atthe medical teaching centres. The consultant service still needs to be organisedwith the teaching centre as its focus, but the service must be spread over a wider area by enabling and encouraging consultants taking part in it to live and work farther afield. Apart from the main effect of greater accessibilityto the public, this will also have a beneficial effect upon general medical practice over larger areas where the habitual presence and services of con-consultants will serve as a means of continuous postgraduate education.The consultant taking part in the service must be associated with hisparticular hospital or hospitals on a much more regular basis and with more regular attendances and duties than is often the case now, when he isregarded as merely &quot; on call.&quot; It will often be desirable that the con-consultants association should be with more than one major hospital, so as toenable the sharing of a common consultant staff to become an effective link between hospitals. The consultants function will be normally one of regular and frequent visiting of these hospitals, both for in-patient and forout-patient consultation; also of properly arranged visiting of outlying&quot;general practitioner&quot; hospitals, which need to be linked with the majorhospitals; and for certain consultants as circumstances may require of visit -ing Health Centres and clinics, and, in case of need, the patients home, atthe request of the general practitioner.For this sort of duty the proper and regular remuneration of consultants,through the hospitals with which they are associated, will become essential.This remuneration, and the engagements entered into in respect of it, canbe on either a full-time or a part-time basis (and might well include part-time engagements with more than one hospital). There will be no need tomake either whole-time or part-time appointment a universal rule.The conditions, including the financial terms, on which consultants under-take work on a whole-time or part-time basis will be a matter for the authori-ties of the hospitals, voluntary or municipal, which offer the appointments;but in order to avoid anomalies as between hospital and hospital and between4 area and area some central regulation of scales will be required.
Some degree of control of the discretion of individual hospital authorities will be required in appointments to senior clinical posts. Under existing prac-tice a danger of &quot; in-breeding &quot; has been commonly recognised, and whileit is important that the ultimate responsibility for an appointment should rest unmistakably with the body of persons conducting the hospital&apos;s affairs,it will be necessary to consider a system under which an expert advisory body recommends a number of suitable candidates from which the hospitalauthority makes the final choice. The necessary machinery could be organised in a variety of ways. It might consist of a number of advisory panels,working over regions based, broadly, on the university and teaching centres and representing both the consultant members of the profession and theuniversity and teaching organisations. One or more representatives of theappointing hospital could join the panel dealing with the sifting of candidates for appointment.V.GENERAL PRACTITIONER SERVICE.The arrangements for general medical practice in the comprehensive service i.e. for ensuring a personal or family doctor for everybody present themost difficult problem of all. This is partly because this will be the front-line of the service, the first source of help on which the individual will relyand one involving a close personal relation between doctor and patient.In addition, although the provision of medical benefit under National HealthInsurance covers over twenty millions of persons and has afforded muchexperience of the working of a public general practitioner service, the widening of public responsibility to cover the whole population and the need to fit the general practitioner into a comprehensive service will create newproblems and will make it necessary to reconsider, without preconception,the whole of the existing arrangements.If the service is to be free to the people for whom it is provided, the doctors taking part in it will look to public funds for their remunerationThey must, therefore, be in some contractual relationship with public authority, which in turn must be able to attach such conditions as will ensure that the services which the people get are the services which they need (and for which they will be paying in taxation and otherwise) and thatthey can get them where and when they need them. The State must, there-fore, take a greater part in future in regard to general medical practice.The method of embodying general medical practice in a nationalservice must observe two principles. The first, which mainly con-ceras the patient, is that people must be able to choose for themselves the doctor from whom they wish to seek their medical advice and treatment,and to change to another doctor if they so wish. Freedom of choice is notabsolute now; it depends on the number and accessibility of doctors and onthe fact that there is a limit to the load which any one doctor can or shouldtake on. But the present degree of freedom must not be generallydiminished, and the fact that public organisation ensures the service mustnot destroy the sense of choice and personal association which is at the heart of &quot; family &quot; doctoring. The second principle, which mainly concerns the doctor, is that the practice of medicine is an individual and personal art, im-patient of regimentation. Whatever the organisation, the doctors taking part must remain free to direct their clinical knowledge and personal skillfor the benefit of their patients in the way which they feel to be best.
Methods of approach to the problem.One method would be to abandon entirely the present system, on whichNational Health Insurance has been based, and to substitute for it a system under which all doctors taking part would become the direct employees of theState or of local authorities and would be remunerated by salary. As a problem of administration, there would be no insuperable difficulty in organis-jng a scheme of this kind. But this is a highly controversial question, onwhich opinions are sharply divided. Many experienced and skilleddoctors would be unwilling to take part in a service so conceived.They would hold that it infringed the second of the two principles juststated, and that if they became the salaried servants whether of theState or of local authorities, they would lose their professional freedomand be fettered in the exercise of their individual skill. Other doctors,with an equal right to be heard, would welcome a salaried service, believing that it would relieve them from business anxieties and enable them to devotethemselves more freely to the practice of their profession. Lay opinion issimilarly varied.The Government have approached the question solely from the point of viewof what is needed to make the new service efficient. Some of the proposals made in this Paper involve forms of medical practice for which present methodsof payment are inappropriate, if not unworkable. Where this is so, remunera-tion by salary or its equivalent is suggested. A universal change to a salariedsystem is not however, in the Governments view, necessary to the efficiency ofthe service. They consider that to make, unnecessarily, so total andabrupt a change in the customary form of general medical practice wouldoffend against the principle earlier stated that the new service should beachieved not by tearing up all established arrangements and start-ing afresh but by evolving and adapting the present to suit the future. Theyare averse from imposing a total salaried service merely for the sake of administrative tidiness.Another alternative would be to maintain the &quot; panel &quot; system of national health Insurance as it is now known, while extending it to the whole popula-tion and expanding it to include consultant and specialist services. Thissystem has had, and still has, its critics, and some of the criticism is well founded. Yet, for more than a generation it has provided a better medical service than was previously available to a large&apos; section of the population and it has enlisted the regular professional services of a great majority of the doctors of the country. There are, however, two overriding reasons why itwill not be possible to meet the new need merely by extending the panelsystem in this way.First, there is at present no effective means of ensuring a properdistribution of doctors. To some extent the demand in any area will, by affording opportunity for practice, itself induce the supply; butthat does not work out reliably or universally. It is true even now thatthe need for doctors in one area may be scantily or unsuitably met, whilethat of another area may be over-supplied. Certainly when the muchbigger public responsibility is assumed of ensuring a personal doctor service for the whole population there will have to be means of securing, throughpublic organisation, that the resources available are so disposed as to fit the public need.Second, there is a great deal of agreement in the profession and elsewhere that developments in the modern technique of medical practice point the way to changes which need encouragement and experiment in any futureservice.  The recent draft Interim Report of the Medical Planning Commission
(organised by the British Medical Association) summarises these trends very well.   For instance, the Report states:  &quot; The days when a doctor armed only with his stethoscope and his drugscould offer a fairly complete medical service are gone. He cannot now beall-sufficient. For efficient work he must have at his disposal modernfacilities for diagnosis and treatment, and often these cannot be providedb)&apos; a private individual or installed in a private surgery. He must also haveeasy and convenient access to consultant and specialist opinion, whether at hospital or elsewhere, and he must have opportunities of real collabora-tion with consultants. Facilities such as these are inadequate at the presenttime. There must also be close collaboration amongst local general prac-practitioners themselves, for their different interests and experience can be of value to each other. Although this need is recognised by practitionerscollaboration has not been developed as it should be.&quot;Or, again, in another passage &quot; At the present time the single-handed practice or partnership is usuallyconducted from a doctor&apos;s private residence. Certain rooms are used forprofessional purposes, and personal or borrowed capital is invested inequipping the practice with apparatus and in keeping it up-to-date; addi-tional domestic staff is employed to keep the surgery and waiting roomsclean and to deal with callers; the secretarial work and record keeping aredone by the doctor himself .or a secretary employed for the purpose; dis-pensing, if done at the surgery, is undertaken either by the doctor or adispenser employed by him. This arrangement is repeated many times overin a fairly well-populated district.&quot;The tendency will be away from the idea of the all-sufficient doctorworking alone, and towards a bigger element of grouped practice and team-work in which the individual doctor retains his personal link with the patient, but has at his side the pooled ability of a group of colleagues aswell as consultant and hospital services behind him. To quote the MedicalPlanning Commission once more:  Diverse as are the views of the organization of medical services, thereis general agreement that co-operation amongst individual general practi-practitioners in a locality is essential to efficient practice under modern conditions,though views vary on the form of the co-operation. The principle of the organisation of general practice on a group or co-operative basis is widelyapproved.&quot;- The Government fully agree that &quot; grouped &quot; practices, to which numerousprivately arranged partnerships are already pointing the way, must havea high place in the planning of the new service and they are designing theservice with this constantly in view. Yet the conception of grouped practicescannot represent the whole shape of the future service. In the first place,th,ere has not yet been enough experience of the idea translated into fact.Not enough has been found out, by trial and error, to determine the con-ditions under which individual doctors can best collaborate or even the extentto which in the long run the public will prefer the group system. Second,it is certain that the system could not be adopted everywhere simultaneously.The change, if experience shows that it should be complete, will take time.The Government intend, therefore, that the new service shall be based on a combination of grouped practice and of separate practice side b3&apos; side. they propose to place the group idea in the forefront of their plans in order thatthere may be a full trial on a large scale of the working of arrangements of thiskind. Grouped practices are more likely to be found suitable in densely populated and highly built-up areas and it is there particularly (though notexclusively) that they should first be tried.   It will then be possible to watch
the development, with the medical profession, and to decide in the light of experience how far and,how fast a change over to the new form of practicecan and should be made.The part of central and of local organisation in the service.All doctors in general practice who join in the new relationship with theirpatients and rely largely in future on public funds for their normal livelihood,must be treated on a similar footing; the terms of their remuneration, thegeneral conditions to be observed&apos;by them and. the rights to be enjoyed bythem must be nationally negotiated and settled.In the National Health Insurance scheme successive Governments have accepted this principle, on which the medical profession itself has laidmuch stress. Although the local Insurance Committees play a valuable and recognised part in the administration of the scheme (and particularlyin handling minor matters of discipline) the service is in fact highly centralised.Terms are laid down in great detail in the Medical Benefit Regulations, andall major questions have either been matters for negotiation between theGovernment and representatives of the profession or-as in the case of enquiries involving the removal of a doctor from the service have been dealtwith by central tribunals appointed by, and answerable to, the Minister.The Government are convinced that, broadly, this system is still the rightone and that it would be a mistake to apply to the new general practitionerservice the normal canons of local government administration. On the otherhand, it is essential that general medical practice in the new health service should not be divorced from the other branches of that service; that wouldperpetuate what is recognised to be the outstanding defect of the presentsystem.   Therefore what is proposed, in outline, is as follows:  (i) The present practice of settling centrally all major terms and condi-tions of service, including remuneration, will stand. The local insurance committees will be abolished and in future doctors, in so far as; they take part in the new general practitioner service, will be in contractual relationwith a Central Medical Board, to which they will look for their remuneration.(2) In general, the other functions of the Insurance committees will also fall to the Board, but to avoid over-centralisation in detail theBoard will discharge many of the minor day-to-day functions through alocal committee or similar agency, on which there will be included membersof the local authority in each area.(3) The new joint authority will have an important part to play of adifferent kind. As the general planning authority for the whole health service in &apos; its. area, it will include the needs of general medical practice,no less than of other services, in its area plan; it will provide for thelinking of general practitioners (whether in grouped or sepai-ate practices)with the hospital and consultant and other services in the area.(4) The county and county borough councils which make up the joint authority will normally each have the function of providing and main-taining such premises (in Health Centres and otherwise) as are approved in the area plan.(5) The doctor himself will, in his contract with the Board, be requiredto observe the arrangements of the area plan and will be given all thenecessary information and facilities to enable him to do this.These are all matters foi further explanation.   The arrangement adoptedis, first, to deal with the particular points arising on &quot; grouped &quot; general practice and  on  &quot; separate &quot;  general practice respectively, and then todeal with features common to both kinds of practice and with the constitution^ and functions of the proposed Central Medical Board.
GROUPED GENERAL PRACTICE.The conception of grouped practice finds its most usual expression in theidea, advocated by the Medical Planning Commission and others, of conduct-ing practice in specially designed and equipped premises where the group cancollaborate and share up-to-date resources the idea of the &quot; Health Centre &quot;.The Government agree that it is in this form that the advantages of the groupsystem can be most fully realised, though it will also be desirable to encourage the idea of grouped practice without special premises. They intend, there-fore, to design the new service so as to give scope to a full trial of this new method of organising medical practice, and so as to enable it to be expandedand developed as time goes on to the maximum extent which the practical experience of its working is found to justify.General fines of Health Centre development.Where Health Centres are set up, their types will need, particularly atfirst, to be varied. Scope must be given (with central and local professionalguidance) to experiment and to design capable of later adaptation. Broadly,the design should provide for individual consulting-rooms, for reception andwaiting-rooms, for simple laboratory work, for nursing and secretarial staff,telephone services and other accessories, as well as in varying degree accordingto circumstances recovery and rest rooms, dark rooms, facilities for minorsurgery, and other ancillaries. The object will be to provide the-doctors with first-class premises and equipment and assistance and so give them the bestfacilities for meeting their patients&apos; needs. The doctors will thus be freed fromthe necessity to provide these things at their own cost. They will join in some-thing like the partnership groups already often privately formed, and therewill be new scope for the young doctor, fresh from hospital training, to take his share in the Centre as an assistant to the practitioners engaged there, andthen, later on, to be eligible for full participation.Limitation of the permitted number of patients will apply whether in.theCentre or&apos;outside it, and, subject to this, the ordinary basis of the patienfschoice of doctor will not be affected. Each Centre will need to be so plannedas to be regarded bv natipntc; not ss q romnlete break with present habit butas a new place at which they can, if they i doctor, in betterwish, continue to see their own doctor farjg^Bd^atwhen he has joined the Centre or can ^ clinic at whkhchoose the doctor in the Centre whom theymonymous publicwant to attend them.     Alternatively,they must be able,  if they prefer it, lications of Healthsimply to select a Health Centre as such,   doctor would be rather than choose a particular doctor at fethe Centre;    and then arrangements will     . necessary, either be made by the Centre to ensure that they ting hours at theobtain all the proper advice and treats     iping of practicesment which they need. !Soul3Ea patient will, in emergency, be able to get immediate attention even thoughhis own doctor does not happen to be available. The grouping of practiceswill, moreover, make it easier for doctors to obtain reasonable holidays andto attend&quot; refresher courses. The internal organisation of the Centre so asto facilitate reasonable absences consistent with the doctor&apos;s responsibilities to his patients will be a matter for the doctors at the Centre themselves.The Centres will be provided first in selected areas. Both central andlocal organisation, and local professional interests represented by the Local
Health Services Council will all have their part to play in this provision.Xhe wish of the local doctors to bring their work into the new Centres must obviously be a big factor in a decision to provide a Centre, but in the last resort the decision will rest on the requirements of the public interest.Provision of Centres.It will be essential to associate any decision to provide Centres, and theirlocation, with the rest of the arrangements of the approved area plan. Thiswill mean, in effect, that the decision in each case that the health centre system should be initiated in a particular part or parts Of the area,and the consequential decis ions cis to the location and size and kind ofCentres to be provided, will normally start in the area itself where the needs arebest known and where the general health services plan is formulated, but will depend in the last resort upon the decision of the Minister in the lightof his central policy on the general practitioner service and the new health centre experiment in the country as a whole. It will be for the joint authority in the first instance, in consultation with the local medical pro-fession, to formulate proposals for a Centre or Centres as part of the area plan_or, later on, as an extension or alteration of that plan and to submit themto the Minister.The actual provision of a Centre will normally be the responsibility of thecounty or county borough council.&apos; This accords with the principle earlierdiscussed under which the clinical and other services which are not essentiallypart of the consultant and hospital field will be allocated to these councils and not to the joint authority.Terms of service in Health Centres.The terms and conditions of service will be settled centrally for all doctorstaking part in the new service, whether in group practice or not, and all doctorswill enter into a contract of service with the central organisation. The doctorpractising in a Centre will not be debarred. from private practice outside it, for those patients who do not wish to take advantage of the new public service,though there will be provision to ensure that the interests of patients withinthe new service do not suffer in any way as a result of this.In certain respects the contract of the doctor in the Health Centre mustdiffer from that of one practising outside. , After the establishment of a Centrethe appointment of a new doctor to the Centre will be made jointly by theCentral Medical Board and the Council administering the Centre and similarly the termination of his engagement at the Centre (except where the doctorhimself wished to bring it to an end).will rest with these two bodies, or ifthey failed to agree, with the Minister. It will be part of the arrangementthat the Council provide the doctors in the Centre with the necessary premises,equipment and ancillary staff. The contract will have to be a three-partyone between the doctor, the Central Medical Board and the Council.But there is one important question in regard to the method of remuneration of the doctor, when practising in co-operation with a group of colleagues ina Health Centre, which does not arise in the same way when he is in separatepractice outside.   That is the method of payment of the individual doctor.It seems fundamental that inside a Centre the grouped doctors should notbe in financial competition for patients. All the practical advantages of theCentre the use of nursing and secretarial staff, record-keeping, equipment,the availability of young assistant doctors in particular will be, under asystem of a salaried team, at the disposal of the group in whatever way theyliked collectively to arrange; it is the whole idea that they should arrange theirown affairs together in this way. But if individual remuneration is basedon mutual competition for patients, complication will enter into anyattempt of the group to allocate and share these services for the more any
GROUPED GENERAL PRACTICE.The conception of grouped practice finds its most usual expression in theidea, advocated by the Medical Planning Commission and others, of conduct-ing practice in specially designed and equipped premises where the group cancollaborate and share up-to-date resources the idea of the &quot; Health Centre &quot;.The Government agree that it is in this form that the advantages of the groupsystem can be most fully realised, though it will also be desirable to encourage the idea of grouped practice without special premises.

Broadly,the design should provide for individual consulting-rooms, for reception andwaiting-rooms, for simple laboratory work, for nursing and secretarial staff,telephone services and other accessories, as well as in varying degree accordingto circumstances recovery and rest rooms, dark rooms, facilities for minorsurgery, and other ancillaries.

Each Centre will need to be so plannedas to be regarded by patients not as a complete break with present habit butlas a new place at which they can continue to see their own doctor, in betterEquipped surroundings if they wish to, or can if they prefer seek advice atthe Centre without having previously made their choice of a particular doctor.It will be important to avoid an atmosphere of an impersonal clinic, at whichthe doctor&apos;s individuality would be submerged in an anonymous publicservice.!There has often been misconception as to the precise implications of health centre practice. It has been too readily assumed that a doctor would be&quot; on duty &quot; only for stated periods daily, and that, outside those periods,his patients would always be attended by some other doctor. That need notbe so. Normally, a doctor will attend his own patients as necessary, either at the Centre or at the home. He will have his consulting hours at theCentre and visit his patients as at present. But the grouping of practicesat a Health Centre will make possible, naturally, a greater fluidity of arrange-ments; for example, as arrangements will be made for continuous staffing,a patient will, in emergency, be able to get immediate attention even thoughhis own doctor does not happen to be available. The grouping of practiceswill, moreover, make it easier for doctors to obtain reasonable holidays andto attend&quot; refresher courses. The internal organisation of the Centre so asto facilitate reasonable absences consistent with the doctor&apos;s responsibilities to his patients will be a matter for the doctors at the Centre themselves.The Centres will be provided first in selected areas. Both central andlocal organisation, and local professional interests represented by the Local
Health Services Council will all have their part to play in this provision.The wish of the local doctors to bring their work into the new Centres must obviously be a big factor in a decision to provide a Centre, but in the last resort the decision will rest on the requirements of the public interest.Provision of Centres.It will be essential to associate any decision to provide Centres, and theirlocation, with the rest of the arrangements of the approved area plan. This&apos;will mean, in effect, that the decision in each case that the health centre system should be initiated in a particular part or parts of the area,and the consequential decisions as to the location and size and kind ofCentres to be provided, will normally start in the area itself where the needs arebest known and where the general health services plan is formulated, but will depend in the last resort upon the decision of the Minister in the lightof his central policy on the general practitioner service and the new health centre experiment in the country as a whole. It will be for the joint authority in the first instance, in consultation with the local medical pro-fession, to formulate proposals for a Centre or Centres as part of the area plan_0Ij later on, as an extension or alteration of that plan and to submit themto the Minister.The actual provision of a Centre will normally be the responsibility of thecounty or county borough council.- This accords with the principle earlierdiscussed under which the clinical and other services which are not essentiallypart of the consultant and hospital field will be allocated to these councils and not to the joint authority.Terms of service in Health Centres.The terms and conditions of service will be settled centrally for all doctorstaking part in the new service, whether in group practice or not, and all doctorswill enter into a contract of service with the central organisation. The doctorpractising in a Centre will not be debarred,from private practice outside it, for those patients who do not wish to take advantage of the new public service,though there will be provision to ensure that the interests of patients withinthe new service do not suffer in any way as a result of this.In certain respects the contract of the doctor in the Health Centre mustdiffer from that of one practising outside. After the establishment of a Centrethe appointment of a new doctor to the Centre will be made jointly by theCentral Medical Board and the Council administering the Centre and similarly the termination of his engagement at the Centre (except where the doctor,himself wished to bring it to an end).will rest with these two bodies, or if they   failed to agree, with the Minister. It will be part of the arrangementthat the Council provide the doctors in the Centre with the necessary premises,equipment and ancillary staff. The contract will have to be a three-partyone between the doctor, the Central Medical Board and the Council.But there is one important question in regard to the method of remuneration of the doctor, when practising in co-operation with a group of colleagues ina Health Centre, which does not arise in the same way when he is in separatepractice outside.   That is the method of payment of the individual doctor.It seems fundamental that inside a Centre the grouped doctors should notbe in financial competition for patients. All the practical advantages of theCentre-the use of nursing and secretarial staff, record-keeping, equipment,the availability of yOung assistant doctors in particular will be, under asystem of a salaried team, at the disposal of the group in whatever way theyliked collectively to arrange; it is the whole idea that they should arrange theirown affairs together in this way. But if individual remuneration is basedon mutual competition for patients, complication will enter into anyattempt of the group to allocate and share these services for the more any
one individual is able to draw on the ancillary helps of the Centre (andparticularly on medical assistants) the more he will gain and his fellowslose in the contest for patient lists.There is therefore a strong case for basing future practice in a health centre on a salaried remuneration or on some similar alternative which willnot involve mutual competition within the Centre. When the salaried or similarprinciple is adopted, the scales will have to be decided in consultation withthe profession itself. In this respect attention is drawn to Appendix D, whichsuggests the method by which a basis could be arrived at for settling bothsalaried remuneration and the payment by capitation later proposed for&quot; separate &quot; practice. It may also be possible, if desired by the doctors them-selves, to offer remuneration on a salaried basis or on some other basis thanthat of capitation fees to doctors engaged in group practice even where thepractice was not conducted in a Health Centre.separate general practice.In &quot; separate &quot; practice the general framework of the National HealthInsurance Scheme will be retained but there will have to be importantchanges from the past and the scheme will have to be much extended andadapted. The nature of these changes will be evident not only from thefollowing paragraphs which relate to &quot; separate &quot; practice, but also from the later paragraphs dealing with features common to both &quot; group &quot; and&quot; separate &quot; practice.Scope of Separate Practice.In future everyone will be entitled, as only &quot; insured &quot; persons are entitledat present, to receive from the doctor chosen by him all the ordinary range ofgeneral medical practice, either at the consulting room or at his home, asthe case requires. He will also be entitled, normally through his doctor,to all the new range of consultant and specialist and hospital or clinic servicesalready considered.A doctor in separate practice will engage himself to provide ordinarymedical care and treatment to all persons and families accepted byhim under the new arrangements. He will work from his own consulting-room and with his own equipment, as he does how, but he will be backed by the new organised service of consultants, specialists, hospitals and clinics,which he will be expected to use for his patients in accordance with the approved area plan earlier described. He will receive his remuneration for work within the new service, not&apos;from the individual patient, but from public funds; and this remuneration will be based as it is now in national health Insurance on a capitation system, depending on the number of patients whose care he undertakes. (A settlement on new lines of the basis for calculating capitation or other forms of remuneration is suggested inAppendix D already referred to.) Even in the case of separate practice therewill be some circumstances in which it will be possible to remunerate thepractitioner on a salaried or similar basis if he so desires. Opportunity forsuch an arrangement may occur, for example, in sparsely populated areas where a single doctor is in fact responsible for all the work of the area and is not therefore in competition with other doctors in the neighbourhood.But, however remunerated, the doctors in separate practice will remainentitled to engage in private practice, since it is no part of the intention of thenew service to prevent persons who prefer to do so from making private arrangements for medical care or to prevent doctors from meeting their needs.Control over entry into- new practice.There will be ho interference with the right of a doctor to go on prac-advertising where he is now and to take part in the public service in that area.
But an unrestricted right to any doctor to enter any new practice and there to claim public remuneration, at his own discretion, would make it impossibleto fulfil the new undertaking to assure a service for all.Under the present National Health Insurance system every qualified doctorhas a right to take up panel practice where he likes. The system enables the Minister, if satisfied that the service in any area is inadequate, to replace the panel system by some other form of arrangements, although with minorexceptions at the outset, of the scheme this power has not been invoked,there has never been any real means of securing that the doctors of thecountry are reasonably distributed. This has perhaps hot been a pressingnecessity while the scheme covered less than half the population, but. it iswell-known that great disparities have existed.If under the new scheme the whole population are to be entitledto a general practitioner service, a much heavier responsibility will be thrown on the Government to see that the needs of the whole popula-tion are met. This implies some. degree of regulation of the dis-tribution of medical resources, at least to the extent of securing that a doctor does not in future take up practice in the public service (whether bypurchasing a practice or by &quot; squatting &quot;), in a locality which is alreadyfully or over-manned. Such control can be left in the profession^ own hands as far as possible, though it must be guided by national policy. Asuitable machinery will be to vest it in the Central Medical Board, working under general guidance on policy from the Government but independentlyin its individual decisions. Any practitioner wishing to set up a new or take over an existing public service practice in a particular area will seek the consent of the Board. The Board will then have regard to the needfor doctors in the public service in that area, in relation to the country as awhole, and to the general policy for the time being affecting the distributionof public medical practice. If it is considered that the area has sufficientor more than sufficient doctors in public practice while other areas need more doctors, consent will be refused. Otherwise it will usually be given without question. The Board will thus be able to help the new joint authorities which, in their general concern with the health services of their area, will turn to the Board to encourage or discourage any further increases in general practice in the area.The part of the new joint authority.It will be the duty of the new joint authority to consider the needsof its area in general medical practice, including &quot; separate &quot; practice, no lessthan in the other branches of the comprehensive service, and to include in thearea plan for central approval the arrangements in terms of numbers anddistribution of general practitioners which it considers to be necessary tomeet these needs. In this it will have the advantage of consultation withthe Local Health Services Council. The plan will need the Minister&apos;s approval,after hearing any conflicting local views. The approved plan will be made known to the Central Medical Board, to be taken into account in the subse-quent exercise of their functions in the distribution of public medical practice.It will also be the dut)? of the joint authority to watch that the supplyof all branches of the comprehensive service is adequate &quot;to the needs oftheir area and in the matter of general practice, therefore, to bring to the noticeof the Minister and the Central Medical Board any needs which they feel shouldbe more adequately met. They will also be responsible for ensuring thatall the other services in their area (hospital, clinic, nursing, consultant and specialist) are fully known to the general practitioners participating in the new service and that the latter are enabled (as their contract willrequire them) to use these services fully for their patients in accordance withthe approved area plan.
It remains to consider certain general questions affecting medical practice,both &quot; grouped &quot; and-&quot; separate &quot;, and to describe more fully the proposalsfor a Central Medical Board.Permitted number of patients.From the outset of medical benefit under National Health Insurance, provi-sion has been made for imposing a limit on the number of insured persons for whose treatment a doctor may make himself responsible. The limit is fixed by a local scheme which is subject to the Minister&apos;s approval, but the regula-tions themselves provide for certain over-all maxima. An additional numberof patients is permitted to a doctor who employs one or more assistants. Underthis system every doctor has a right to undertake as much -private practice ashe desires and is able to secure, and it is usual for the doctor of an insuredhead of a family to look after the uninsured wife and children under private arrangements.In the new service also there will have to be prescribed limits to the numberof patients whose care any one doctor can properly undertake. But thesituation will be substantially altered by a scheme which covers the whole population and which contemplates both grouped and separate practice.It is not the wish of the Government to debar anyone who prefers not to availhimself of the public service from obtaining treatment privately, nor to prohibit a doctor in the public service from carrying on any private practicebut it will be necessary to ensure that the interests of the patients in the publicservice do not suffer thereby.In fixing the appropriate limits, in future, allowance will need to be madefor private practice remaining after the new service is in operation. Therewill need to be room for flexibility. A doctor entirely free from outside activity and able to give his whole time to general practitioner work in the new service will need to be able to work to a higher permitted limit of public patients. a doctor with an unusually large amount of private work, or with appointmentsin other branches of the public service, will be expected to work to a lowerpermitted limit. The effective way to provide reasonable flexibility is to entrust the aecision in such cases to a suitable professional organisation which will naturally be the Central Medical Board working through its local committees.The details of. this are for discussion with the profession^ representatives at alater stage, but the object must be to see that the care of patients under publicarrangements does not suffer in quality or quantity by reason either of privatecommitments or other public engagements. Nor must anyone come to believethat he can obtain more skilled or more considerate treatment by obtaining itprivately than by seeking it within the new service.Entry into the public service.There is a strong case for requiring all young doctors, leaving hospital andentering individual practice for the first time, to go through a short period of apprentiship &quot; as assistants to more experienced practitioners. There is a particularly strong case for saying that this should be required by the State in medical practice remunerated from public funds. When such a rule is madethe young assistant doctor will have to be assured of reasonable conditions and opportunity, and certainly&apos; must not be at risk of being precluded from a properprofessional livelihood by the operation of the rule. One way will be torequire a suitable period as an assistant except where the Central medical board dispensed from the rule (e.g. to meet cases where an assistant post isnot reasonably obtainable).   There will, no doubt, be many opportunities to
105employ assistants in Health Centres where the terms and conditions ofemployment can be&apos; regulated and the Board will be able to help new entrants to find suitable vacancies. In the case of &quot; separate &quot;practices within the public service, the . Board must be. empoweredto&apos; satisfy itself through its local organisation as to the proposed arrangements and remuneration for an assistant, before consentingto his engagement by the principal seeking him-general guidance on stan-dards and terms being given centrally to the Board, in consultation withthe profession. The ordinary general practitioner wishing to undertake the care of a larger nurnber of public patients than the ordinary permittedmaximum will then inform the Board, and the Board after satisfying itself of the circumstances as above^-will help an intending assistant to get the poston the terms approved.

Q^SUrA. .        &apos;.r ...    .yC \ \ &apos;\jCompensation and superannuation.The Government recognise that the adoption of the proposals made in this paper will, in certain cases, destroy the value of existing medical practices.In such cases compensation will be paid. It will be necessary to discussthe arrangements for this in detail with the medical profession but there aretwo classes of case in which a just claim for compensation will clearly arise.The first is that of a practice in an &quot; over-doctored &quot; area, to the sale ofwhich the Central Medical Board refuse consent. Here the out-going doctoror his representatives will be paid compensation for any loss of the valueof his practice.The second case is that of a doctor who decides to give up his &quot; separate &quot;public practice and to take service in a Health Centre. It will be whollyincompatible with the conception of a Health Centre that individual practiceswithin the Centre should be.bought and sold and a doctor will therefore,by entering a Centre, exchange a practice having a realisable value for a practice which he will be debarred from selling on retirement. On theother hand the. Government consider that an efficient superannuation system will be an essential part of the Health Centre organisation. A doctor enteringa Centre will consequently acquire both superannuation rights and other facilities of considerable value. The proper course will be to strike a fair balance between what he is gaining and what he is losing and to compensatehim accordingly.It would be more difficult to institute a superannuation scheme for doctorsengaged in &quot; separate &quot; practices, but the Government would be glad todiscuss with the medical profession the possibility of working out an accept-able scheme to provide for retirement within specified age limits and the granting of superannuation rights on a contributory basis.Sale and purchase of public practices.The Government have not overlooked the case which can be made for thetotal abolition of the sale and purchase of publicly remunerated practices.The abolition would, however, involve great practical difficulty and is not essential to the working of the new service which the Government propose.The Government intend, however, to discuss the whole question with the,profession, to see if some workable and satisfactory solution can be reached.(CThe creation of Health Centres will, meanwhile, do a great deal to limit the scope of the present system.  The Centres will afford a wide opportunity to young doctors to enter their profession without financial burdens.   They willalso, wherever they are set up, bring into being a new form of practice which :31032 B in particular, it would obviously be     * Svincongruous that the new public service should itself have the effect of increas-ing the capital value of an individualpractice and thus increasing the amountof compensation which may have to beprovided under the circumstances described in the preceding paragraphs;and measures to prevent this must beincluded in the discussion.
will thereafter be entirely free from any necessity of sale and purchase. More-over, the system proposed earlier of requiring young men who join the publicservice normally to undergo a period of assistantship will go far to avoid the danger of a doctor purchasing a practice which he has not the necessaryexperience to handle successfully.Creation of a Central Medical Board.It is intended to create from the profession itself a special executive bodyat the centre, which will undertake some of the administrative work of theservice requiring a specially intimate link with the profession.As the contract of the doctor will be in a public service, remunerated from public funds, the Board will clearly have to be subject to the general direc-tions of the Minister, but subject to those general directions it will be theorganisation with which the doctor will deal as the &quot; employer &quot; element inthe service i.e., the organisation with which he will be in contract, whetherengaged in &quot; separate &quot; or in grouped or Health Centre practice (although in Health Centre practice the local authority will be joined in the contract).It is not for this Paper to suggest all the details of the doctor&apos;s contract atthis stage (they will be for discussion with the profession&apos;^ representatives);but they will need to provide -(a) for the doctor to give all normal professional advice and services which his proper competence to those whose care he undertakes;(6) for him to comply with the approved area plan for obtaining consultantand specialist and hospital services;(c) for proper machinery for the hearing of complaints by patients and forthe general kind of disciplinary and appeal procedure already familiar in national Health Insurance;(d) for the observance of reasonable conditions, centrally determined withthe profession, respecting certification and other matters which must ariseany publicly organised service.The existing doctor will enter into the new contract in respect of his existing practice; the new doctor, or doctor entering a new practice, will first obtainthe Board&apos;s consent (as already suggested) and then enter into the necessarycontract in respect of his new practice. Termination of the contract willordinarily be either by the doctor, at any time after due notice, or by theBoard, under conditions which will no doubt be substantially similar tothose now obtaining under National Health Insurance, with such specialextra provisions as may be necessary in the case of Health Centre practice.Under these arrangements there will be no need for the continuance ofthe present local Insurance Committees of the National Health Insurancescheme, and these Committees will be abolished. The minor day-to-dayfunctions now exercised by Insurance Committees (so far as these still arise under the new and wider service) can be handled by a local medical Com-mittee of the Board in each area, on which local authority members can beincluded.The Board will also watch over the distribution of public medical practicegenerally. In &quot; separate &quot; practice it will do this through the arrangementsalready described, under which its consent will be required before a vacantpublic practice is refilled or a new public practice established. In health centre practice it will be the agency through which any additional doctorsrequired in future are introduced into any particular Centre, after suitableconsultation  with the doctors already working  there,  through the local
committees earlier proposed in place of the present Insurance Committees.It will be the agency through which young doctors obtain appointmentsas assistants at Health Centres and by which the terms and conditions ofassistants in &quot; separate &quot; practice are protected in the way already proposed_and from which any dispensation of the requirement of an initial &apos;&apos; appren-apprenticeship &quot; for new doctors will have to be sought.The Board will also take on many functions on the doctor&apos;s behalf e.g.in approaching the appropriate medical schools and hospitals with a viewto the arrangement of post-graduate and refresher courses for those in general practice, in acting as the general centre of advice and help in the move-ment of doctors within the public service and in the various personalproblems and requests for information which will doubtless arise. It will,with the Minister, provide the central organisation to which the new joint authorities will make known their area&apos;s needs in general practice, in accord-ance with the approved area plans for the health service as a whole.The Board can be a small body, under a regular chairman a few of its members being full-time and the rest part-time. It would be mainly pro-fessional, but it will also have lay members on its strength. In view of the wide scope of its executive functions and handling of public funds its meimber-ship and organisation will have to be finally settled by the Minister, althoughof course in full consultation with the profession.Supply of drugs and medical appliances.The existing system under National Health Insurance, under which panelsof chemists are formed in each area on lines closely corresponding to thepanels of doctors, has worked on the whole with success. &apos; In detail thesystem is no doubt capable of improvement, and discussion with the appro-priate pharmaceutical bodies will be welcomed by the Government. Inparticular, it will be necessary to consider the arrangements to be made inconnection with the supply of drugs to patients attending Health Centres.As regards medical and surgical appliances, the existing system entitlesan insured person to the supply, free of charge, of certain appliances specifiedin the Medical Benefit Regulations if ordered by a doctor. These &quot; pre-scribed appliances &quot; are, in the main, the articles most commonly requiredin general practice. In a service which includes treatment of all kinds,whether in or out of hospital, the range of necessary appliances will haveto be greatly extended; but, as was indicated in the Beveridge Report, itwill be a matter for consideration whether in the case of the more expensiveappliances the patient himself should not be called upon, if his financial resources permit, to contribute towards the cost either of the appliancesinitially ordered, or at least of repairs and replacements. The point willbe of particular importance in connection with the dental and ophthalmicservices.The need for a new attitude in patient and doctor.The aim of the service will be to provide every person, or better stillevery family, with a personal or family practitioner who will be able tobecome familiar with the circumstances of those in his care-in the homeand at work. It is to be hoped that doctor and patient will not waitalways till the latter falls ill and urgently requires treatment. The doctormust try, in short, to become the general adviser in all matters concernedwith health (no less than with disease) on which a doctor is so well qualified to advise. This means a changed outlook in much of present medical practice a change that has long been wanted and advocated by most doctorsthemselves and for which they more than anyone have desired theopportunity. But such a change cannot be effected overnight. It willbe helped if a new trend can be given to undergraduate medical education
and, fortunately, there are plenty of signs that medical schools are begin-ning to realise the importance of this. It will take time to develop; butit is worth stating clearly at the outset that, unless this kind of medical care is ultimately provided for every person and every family, the medical profession will not be giving the public the full service which it needs ancwhich &apos;only the medical profession can give. To provide or to extend a service which considers only the treatment of the sick is neither in accordancewith the modern conception. of what a doctor should be trained to do noiin keeping with the general desire that the family practitioner should begin to undertake many of the duties at present performed by his colleagues in the public health service,VI.CLINIC AND OTHER SERVICES.Apart from the hospital and consultant and family doctor services, the comprehensive health service must include arrangements for home nursingand midwifery and health visiting and die various kinds of local clinic and similar services which have either been provided in the past under specialstatutory powers or will have to be established in the future.When the new service is established, these local services will not be pro-vided as entirely separate entities, but rather as parts of the one new generalduty to secure a whole provision for health. It will be the duty of the newjoint authority by means of the arrangements proposed by it and approvedby the Minister in the general area plan to ensure that all these differentactivities are properly related to each other, to the personal or family doctorservice and to&apos; the hospitals and consultants, and that they are arranged in theright way and in the right places to meet the area&apos;s needs. This done, it willbe the duty either of the joint authority or of the separate county and countyborough authorities which together constitute it, as the case may be, to provideand maintain the various services on the lines of the settled area plan. Theusual sharing of responsibility in this respect between the joint authority andthe several counties and county boroughs under the proposals describedearlier in this Paper will be recalled.When these local services are arranged and regarded as parts of the oneplanned service of the wider area, there will be room for experiment andinnovation in the way they are provided particularly as time goes on andthe full service gets into its stride. It is reasonable to look forward to thetime when the general medical practitioner, the personal doctor with whomthe individual and the family are regularly associated, will be able to beconnected more closely with the services which are performed at specialclinics e.g. for child welfare, in which there is no doubt that in much ofthe general care of the young child and the handling of many of its day-to-dayproblems the clinics and the family doctor who has the general medical care of the child must be enabled to work in better contact for their commonpurpose. To make this possible on any substantial scale there will have tobe much more opportunity than there is now for the family doctor to acquirespecial experience in the children&apos;s wards of hospitals and in general cMdwelfare subjects and the chance of post-graduate training and refresher workin these and other special subjects. Where grouped general practice in health centres is tried there will be special opportunity for this kind of development.But whatever developments there may be in the clinics or other serviceslocally provided, or in the method of operating them in relation to other branches of the service as a whole, it is clear that the coming into operation
of the new service will certainly not involve closing down or abandoningany existing facilities but much rather increasing and strengthening themto fit the new and wider objects in view. Therefore the effect of the pro-posals in this Paper on the main local services of this kind as they are knownnow_and on the position of the local authorities responsible for them canbe summarised.Maternity and child welfare services.The arrangement of lying-in accommodation in hospital or maternity home_indeed all the institutional provision for maternity, both for normal andfor complicated cases will become simply one part of the re-organisedhospital and consultant services and will be the responsibility of the newjoint authority. The ordinary functions of the maternity -and child welfareclinics, however concerned, as they are, not primarily with direct medical treatment but more with the convenient local provision of general advice and care in the day-to-day bringing-up of young children and in the mothers&apos;associated problems will not be transferred to the new joint authority but will lie wherever the related functions of child education are made byParliament to lie under the new Education Bill. Under the proposals inthat Bill, as they stand now, this will mean that the county and countyborough councils will be the authorities primarily responsible, but thatarrangements will be made in suitable cases for delegating much of thepractical care of the service to some of the existing authorities, within the counties, which have hitherto carried the responsibility and which haveaccumulated good experience and local interest.The maternity and child welfare clinics, although provided and maintained in this special way over the various parts of the joint authority&apos;s area tomeet the need for the link with education, will be as much a subject as anyother part of the health service for the general plan for that area which thejoint authority will prepare and the Minister finally settle. The sufficiencyof the clinics, their distribution, their connection with the necessary specialist services and the hospitals, and the other main arrangements concerned, willall be covered by the wider area plan.What has been said of the clinics applies equally to those arrangementsfor domiciliary mid wives and health visitors which need to be ancillary tothe clinics&apos; work, and responsibility for those will lie with the sameauthorities and be similarly affected by the general area plan.School Medical Service.In this service also the proposals need to be related to the proposals inthe current Education Bill. The conception underlying both the Bill andthe present Paper is that the education . authorities will retain as part oftheir educational machinery the functions of inspection of children in theschool group (the supervision, in fact, of the state of health in which the child attends school and of the effects of school life and activities on thechi!d&apos;s health), together with the important function of using the influence of the school and the teacher and the whole school relationship with childand parent to encourage the recourse of the child to all desirable medical treatment. But, as from the time when the new health service is ableto take over its comprehensive care of health, the child will look for itstreatment to the organisation which that service provides and the educationauthority, as such, will give up responsibility for medical treatment.Tuberculosis dispensaries and other infectious disease work.The local tuberculosis dispensaries will in future be regarded as out-patient centres of the hospital and consultant service,  and  responsibility
for them will normally rest directly with the joint authority dealing withthe whole of this &quot;aspect of the new service over its wide area. . Just asit will be the aim to enable the main sanatorium and hospital treatmentof tuberculosis to be more fully related in future to other specialist aspects,of the diagnosis and care of diseases of the respiratory tract generally and oforthopaedic conditions, so it will also be essential to develop the local tuber-rulosis dispensaries as specialist out-post centres of the same service, wherethe physician has charge of and direct access to hospital and sanatoriumbeds and where the same consultants cover both in-patient and out-patientactivity. The physician in charge needs particularly to concern himselfalso with the social and home conditions of his patients in tuberculosis,but it is not proposed that such activities as the securing of appropriatehousing for the tuberculous shall pass with the dispensaries to the newjoint authority. In such matters the physician in charge must look to thelocal authority normally concerned with these things.All isolation hospital responsibilities will similarly pass under the pro-posals earlier explained,. to the new joint authority as part of. the general hospital problem of its area. But there will remain a field of day-to-day epidemiological work many of the measures dealing with the notifica-tion of the diseases, the local control of the spread of&apos; infection, and environmental factors affecting this, which are the subject of statutory powers under the Public Health Acts already-which can, still be suitably carriedout locally in the different parts of the joint authority&apos;s area, although itwill probably be found that most of these activities should in future becentred in the county and county borough councils rather than distributedmore widely, as they are now, over the districts of the minor authorities.In epidemiology in its wider sense there will be some activities which mustbe organised on a full national basis, rather than locally, and here the valuableexperience of the Emergency Public Health Laboratories will be a pointerto future development.Cancer diagnostic centres.Responsibility for the local centres of diagnosis and advice which were contemplated when the Cancer Act of 1939 was passed, and which havehad little chance to develop substantially during the war, will pass withthe other responsibilities of that Act to the new joint authorities as a partof the general hospital and consultant service.Mental clinics.Local mental clinics are essentially an out-patient activity of the hospital andconsultant service like the tuberculosis dispensaries and responsibility forthese clinics will therefore belong to the new joint authority in its general care of mental health.Venereal diseases.The allocation of the present service for venereal diseases, in the hands ofthe county and county borough councils,. between those authorities andthe new joint authority in which they will for some purposes be combined,presents peculiar difficulty. In one sense it is essentially a clinic service whichcan continue to be locally organised within the framework of the newarea plan, and which it is arguable need not be regarded as essentiallypart of the wider hospital and consultant field. The newly developing use-started during the war-of the help of individual general practitioners to supplement the work of the clinics lends some point to this. On the otherhand it is a service requiring a high degree of specialisation in future and it
4i    .is as a matter of convenience one which is usually attached to hospitalpremises; these are factors which point to associating it directly with there-organised hospital service.. It is something of a &quot; border-line &quot; case,in fact, and will be best left to the settlement of the area plan, in each case to determine.New services likely to develop.A full home nursing service must be one of the aims of the new re-organisation. How far it needs to be directly provided by public authority,or indirectly by public arrangements made with other bodies,, or both, willbe matters for discussion. Its object must be to ensure that all who neednursing attention in their own homes will be able to obtain it without charge.Responsibility for securing this will normally be exercised by the individualcounty and county borough councils within the general area plan.The fact that there must be delay in reaching a stage at which general dental and ophthalmic services can be provided for all has been referred toearlier in the Paper. Nevertheless, nothing less must be the object in view and the best ways and means will need to be discussed in detail with thedentists and doctors and others concerned. For some time dental care,at least, will have to be concentrated on &quot;the present priority classes -andparticularly on the children and adolescents. These are matters on which,so far as dentistry is concerned, the views of the Teviot Committee, already referred to, will have a valuable bearing and must be awaited. But it is clearthat one of the main calls at first will be on the clinics and similar services for the pre-school and school child.The new service of the Health Centre for general medical practice hasalready been considered, and when it comes into operation it will normally be the county or county borough council&apos;s function to provide and maintainthe Centres.Medical research.A valuable part of the medical research carried on in this country isconducted in the hospitals, and in close association with the day-to-daywork of the hospitals. It has been the policy of the Medical research council the body set up under Royal Charter and under the auspices ofthe Committee of the Privy Council for Medical Research to guide and stimulateand co-ordinate research to encourage this work in the hospitals themselves and to assist it financially. Generally, it is felt that this is a more fruitftdmethod of securing valuable results than the alternative method of multiplyingspecial State institutions for the purpose, and it is of first importance thatit should continue and develop, both in the municipal and in the voluntary-hospitals and institutions. It does not appear to require any new expressauthority, and the powers of local authorities under statute and of voluntary hospitals under charters or trust deeds or other instruments seem to be alreadysufficient.The Part of Medical Officers of Health and others.Whatever changes there may be in the scope of the health services locallyprovided and in the local organisation for providing them, it is clear thatthere will be an even more important part in the future than there has beenin the past for social medicine and the medical organisation of public health.The new service will make great calls upon all those medical men and womenalready engaged in the work of local health authorities, and upon all thosewho assist in the ancillary services now; just as it will give new scope and better opportunity not only to those already engaged but to newcomers tothis branch of professional life.
THE SERVICE IN SCOTLAND.What has already been said with regard to the present state of the health and medical services, the chief deficiencies in the existing arrangements, andthe general shape of a comprehensive service which would make good thesedeficiencies applies equally to Scotland as to England and Wales.The general administrative structure of the service in the two countries,however, cannot for various reasons be the same. The development of the health services has not been entirely uniform up to the present time; here andthere differences occur in the scope and organisation of corresponding services;and each country has services for which there is no counterpart in the other.The most important of these differences are described in Appendix A. Thereason why the new service, although the same in scope and objects in both countries, cannot be organised on entirely similar lines is that account mustbe taken of certain differences of geography and local government structure in Scotland, as compared with England and Wales. For example about 80per cent, of Scotland&apos;s population is concentrated in about 17 per cent, of thetotal area of the country, across its industrial &quot; waist.&quot; Outside the industrialbelt are large and for the most part sparsely populated areas. Of the 55existing health authorities in Scotland only 10 have populations of more than100,000 and 32 have a population under 50,000. Against this, the populationof England and Wales is on the whole much more urbanised and the localgovernment units are larger with correspondingly greater resources.CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION.There will be no substantial difference in the cenLral machinery to be setup in Scotland as compared with England and Wales.The Secretary of State, as the Minister of the Crown concerned with the health of the people of Scotland, will be directly responsible to parliament for the administration of the new service and will exercise his functionsthrough the Department of Health for Scotland.A Central Health Services Council for Scotland will be set up by statute withthe same kind of constitution, powers and functions as the correspondingCouncil in England and Wales. It will consist of representatives of themedical, dental, pharmaceutical and nursing professions and of the voluntary and municipal hospital authorities in Scotland, appointed by the Secretary ofState after consultation with the organisations represented, and the council will select its own chairman. It will advise the Secretary of State on anytechnical aspect of the service, either in response to a request for advice fromthe Secretary of State or on its own initiative, and the Secretary of State will berequired to submit to Parliament annually a report on the CounciTs work during each year.Similarly, Scotland will have a separate Central Medical Board to acton behalf of the Secretary of State in the day-to-day administration of thegeneral practitioner service. This Board will perform the same functions as the corresponding English organisation described, in chapter IV,and like that organisation it will be created mainly from the medical profession itself. There will clearly have to be the closest liaison between thetwo Boards to secure uniform administration of the general practitionerservice in the two countries, and special arrangements will have to be made,by a common list of doctors and in other ways, to deal with the movementof doctors from one country to the other.
LOCAL ORGANISATION.It is in the local organisation of the service that the arrangements proposed for England and Wales must be modified to suit the special circumstances prevailing in Scotland. In England and Wales it is proposed to define areasof suitable size and resources for the direct administration of thehospital and consultant branches of the service and for the local planning of the service as a whole, and to secure suitable authorities to carryout these tasks by the combination of existing authorities in thearea. To do this in quite the same way in Scotland would usuallybe out of the question since the areas which would have to be definedfor the purpose would be so big as to be quite unwieldy and indeeddestructive of local government administration. The point can probably best be illustrated in relation to the hospital service. Successive Committees onhospital problems have emphasised the need for planning and co-ordinating the hospital service in Scotland over wider areas, and for this purpose have recommended the selection of the four natural hospital regions based on the cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee, where the key hospitalsas well as the medical schools are to be found, with a fifth based for geo-&quot;raphical reasons on Inverness. While areas of this size are necessary forthe planning and co-ordination- of a comprehensive hospital service, they are clearly too large for local government purposes. This means that co-ordination of the hospital service and responsibility for its actual provisionhave in Scotland to be separated in a way which does not apply to Englandand Wales.As will be seen, these special requirements in the hospital service must tosome extent affect the local organisation of the other branches of the new service as a whole, and in particular it is proposed that the scope of theduties of the new Joint Hospital Boards in Scotland shall not extend beyondthe hospital and auxiliary services.Administration of the hospital and consultant service.It is intended to adopt the recommendations made by various Committees,including the Committee on Scottish Health Services and the HetheringtonCommittee, that a Regional Hospitals Advisory Council should be set upin each of the five hospital regions referred to. The Council will consistof members nominated in equal numbers by (i) the new Joint Hospitals boards of combined local authorities in the region, and (ii) the voluntary hospitals,with an independent chairman to be appointed by the Secretary of State. Inaddition, it can include a small number of representatives of the medical and medical-educational interests of the region.The functions of the Councils will be consultative and advisory. They will advise the Secretary of State on the measures necessary to secure the co-ordina-tion of hospital planning within the region.A further important function which the Councils will perform will beto advise the Secretary of State on the co-ordination of the consultantservice between the hospitals and other services, and they might, throughsub-committees, also advise hospital authorities on the filling of vacancies inconsultant and senior hospital appointments.Next, it is proposed to set up Joint Hospitals Boards formed by such combina-tions of neighbouring major health authorities as are found necessary to ensurethat an adequate hospital and consultant service is provided for each combinedarea. In one or two areas where circumstances are suitable, and where thepopulation is large enough and the resources adequate to support a satisfactoryhospital service, the major health authority will continue to be the hospitalauthority without combination with any other local authority.
The Joint Hospitals Board will be composed entirely of representatives from the county councils and the town councils of large burghs in the areaconcerned. They will take over the whole ownership and responsibility forthe hospitals of their constituent authorities, will be charged with the statu-tory duty&apos; of securing a proper hospital service for their area by their ownprovision and by arrangements with other Joint Hospitals Boards or voluntary hospitals and will, in fact, be, so far as executive responsibility for thehospital service is concerned, the counterpart of the new joint authority inEngland and Wales.The Joint Hospitals Board will have the duty of preparing a scheme forthe hospital services of their area, after consultation with the voluntary hos-hospitals. They will be encouraged also to consult the Regional Hospitals Ad-visory Council at this stage to secure the fullest measure of agreement betweenthe area plan and the wider regional arrangements proposed by the Council.The Joint Hospitals Board will then submit their scheme to the Secretaryof State who will consult the Regional Hospitals Advisory Council to obtain their final views before deciding to approve or amend the scheme.As will be seen, these Joint Hospitals Boards will also be charged with responsibility for the administration of certain clinic services, such as thetuberculosis dispensaries, which can be regarded as essentially a part-of thehospital service.Administration of the clinic services.The arrangements proposed for the clinic services in England and Wales willbe modified in their application to Scotland. This is necessary because, unlike the new joint authorities to be set up in England and Wales, the Joint HospitalsBoards in Scotland will not have planning functions outside the hospital service.In these circumstances the following arrangements will apply.Responsibility for the administration of the school health service with itsnumerous clinics will remain with the education authorities, namely, thecounty councils and the town councils of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen andDundee, but these authorities will be expected to use the treatment services provided under the new scheme.Normally the ordinary local clinics such as those for the maternity and child welfare service, including antenatal clinics, for the venereal diseaseservice and for scabies will remain with the existing major health authorities,namely, the county councils and the town councils of the large burghs whichcorrespond in Scotland to the county and county borough councils in Englandand Wales. These authorities will normally retain responsibility for the mid-wifery and health visitor services. On the other hand, there are certain clinicservices which are more nearly allied to the hospital service than to a clinicservice. The most notable examples of this category are the tuberculosisdispensaries and cancer clinics. The administration of these &quot; out-post &quot;clinics will be entrusted to the new Joint Hospitals Boards as being ancillaryto their main function of hospital administration.No further change of general scope will be undertaken with regard to theclinic service. As recommended by the Committee on Scottish Health Ser-vices, however, it is proposed to strengthen the powers of the Secretary ofState to require local health authorities, after a public local inquiry has beenheld, to combine for any purpose where this is proved necessary for theefficiency of the new health service as a whole. In this way it will be possibleto leave essentially local clinic services with the major health authorities whilesecuring an adequate safeguard that, should the need arise in the publicinterest for a combination of local authorities in any area for any specificpurpose, effective machinery will be available for the purpose.
The responsibility for any new clinic services will be determined by their particular function: if they are purely local services they will be entrusted to the existing major health authorities, while if they are allied to the hospital service they will probably be entrusted to the Joint Hospitals Boards.Administration of the general practitioner service.There will be a difference between the two countries so far as the pro-vision, equipment and maintenance of Health Centres are concerned. InEngland and Wales this responsibility will rest normally with the county or county borough councils. In Scotland, however, the smaller size of theproblem and the geography and distribution of population suggest that thewhole country can more conveniently be regarded as one area for thispurpose, and the Centres where they are decided upon can be providedby the Department of Health itself, at least in the initial and experimentalyears. Having in view the nature of the local organisation of the health service generally, which is proposed for Scotland, it seems desirable thatthe provision, equipment and maintenance of Health Centres should be administered centrally in the general practitioner service. The Secretary ofState will be empowered, however, to delegate any of his functions withregard to the provision of Health Centres to a local authority&apos; where he thinksthis to be desirable.Local Medical Services Committees.The local organisation already described will secure effective liaison betweenthe hospital and consultant services on the one hand and the local authorityclinic services on the other. There remains the general practitioner service.For the purpose of linking that service with all the other parts of the new service as a whole, there will be set up, over the same areas as those of theJoint Hospitals Boards, new advisory bodies to be known as Local medical services Committees.These will be to some extent similar to the Local Health Services Councilsproposed for England and Wales, but with differences of function and of organisation to suit the different local arrangements in the two countries.They will be primarily advisory bodies, but because of the vital role whichthey will play in linking up the various branches of the health service in their areas they will need to include not only professional but local authorityrepresentatives.The Local Medical Services Committees will consist of representatives of allthe local health authorities in the area, of the local medical, dental, pharma-ceutical and nursing professions, and of other interests closely concernedwith the health services. The Committees will be able to appoint such sub-committees, professional or general, as they find desirable.The primary function of these Committees and of their professional sub-committees will be to advise the Secretary of State on any questions affect-ing the lo,cal administration of the general practitioner service and its relation-ship to the other health services. As, for reasons given, the Joint HospitalsBoards will be concerned with hospital and consultant services only and notwith the health services as a whole, the Secretary of State will look to these committees so far as the general practitioner service is concerned forinformation and advice on the sufficiency and distribution of doctors in any area, the need for Health Centres, and other relevant matters.The Committees will also provide a suitable means of liaison betweenthe general practitioner service and the local clinic and hospital and con-sultant services being carried on in their areas by the local authorities and theJoint Hospitals Boards.   For example, they will be able to advise the
Secretary of State on methods of effecting the closer liaison between the family doctor, the child welfare clinics and the hospital, as forecasted by theOrr Report on Infantile Mortality. They will be there to advise all those authorities as needed, and will be able also to send representatives to sitwith the larger Regional Hospitals Councils to assist with their right ofdirectly expressing their views to the Secretary of State at any time -inmaking the liaison complete.In addition, as the new general practitioner service will no longer require thelocal Insurance Committees which have operated under the National HealthInsurance scheme in the past, no doubt such of the functions of these bodiesas do not need in future to be centrally undertaken might be usefully entrusted to the Local Medical Services Committee. But these are matters for later consideration.VIII.PAYMENT FOR THE SERVICE.The cost of the comprehensive health service will mainly fall upon central and local public funds. The ways in which it might be shared between theexchequer and the local rates, and other financial aspects of the servicegenerally, are considered in the Financial Memorandum appended (AppendixE).So far as the individual members of the public are concerned, they willbe able in future to obtain all necessary medical advice and treatment of every kind entirely without charge except for the cost of certain appliances. Theywill, in fact, be paying for their medical care in a new way, not by privatecontract and fee but partly by an insurance contribution under whatever social insurance scheme is in operation and partly by the ordinary processes of central and local taxation.Hospitals taking part in the scheme will, as already explained, receive from central funds payments which will include their share of the moneyrepresenting the social insurance contributions of the public, so far as this is attributable to hospital services in the scheme. This share can be made payable on a bed-unit basis, according to the number of beds put into the new service by each hospital in accordance with each approved area plan except thatthe share of the voluntary hospitals can, if they wish, be pooled and redistributedin the manner earlier mentioned.The voluntary hospitals will receive in addition the fixed service payments from the new joint authority already discussed, in respect of all services whichthey contract to render to the scheme. For the rest, they will meet the costs of their participation in the new service out of their normal resources, includ-ing charitable subscriptions and donations, on which their voluntary statusdepends. The position of the teaching hospitals will be specially consideredafter the Committee on Medical Schools has reported.The joint authorities will receive directly from central funds thebed-unit payments which wiU include their share of the social insurance contri-butions attributable to hospital services. Otherwise the liability to meet their expenses in the service including their service-payments to the voluntary hospitals taking part will be met partly out of rate resources and partly out of central funds. For their rate revenues the joint authorities will depend upon precept upon the counties and county boroughs which areincluded in each joint area. The county and county borough councils, bothin meeting these precepts and in meeting their own expenses in the service,will receive exchequer aid.
iIX.GENERAL  SUMMARY.It may be convenient, at this point, to summarise the proposals of this paper in outline:  i. Objects in view.(i) To ensure that everybody in the country irrespective of means, age,sex, or occupation shall have equal opportunity to benefit from the best and most up-to-date medical and allied services available.(2) To provide, therefore, for all who want it, a comprehensive servicecovering every branch of medical and allied activity, from the care of minor ailments to major medicine and surgery; to include the care 01mental as well as physical health, and all specialist services, eg. for tuberculosis-losis, cancer, infectious diseases, maternity, fracture and orthopaedic treat-ment, and others; to include all normal general services, e.g. the family doctorand the nurse, the care of the teeth and of the eyes, the day-to-day care ofthe child; and to include all necessary drugs and medicines and a wide range of appliances.(3) To divorce the care of health from questions of personal means orother factors irrelevant to it; to provide the service free of charge (apart from certain possible charges in respect of appliances) and to encourage a newattitude to health the easier obtaining of advice early, the promotion of goodhealth rather than only the treatment of bad.2. General principles to be observed.   -(1) Freedom for people to use or not to use these facilities at their ownwish; no compulsion into the new service, either for patient or for doctor; no interference with the making of private arrangements at private cost, ifanyone still prefers to do so.(2) Freedom for people to choose their own medical advisers under thenew arrangements as much as they do now; and to continue with theirpresent advisers, if they wish, when the latter take part in the new arrange-rnenfs..(3) Freedom for the doctor to pursue his professional methods in hisown individual way, and not to be subject to outside clinical interference.(4) The personal doctor-patient relationship to be preserved, and thewhole service founded on the &quot; family doctor &quot; idea.(5) These principles to be combined with the degree and kind of publicorganisation needed to see that the service is properly provided e.g. toensure better distribution of resources and to give scope-to new methods,such as group practice in Health Centres.3. General method of organising the service.(1) The maximum use of good existing facilities and experience; no un-necessary uprooting of established services, but the welding together ofwhat is there already, adapting it and adding to it and incorporating it inthe larger organisation.(2) The basis to be the creation of a new public responsibility; to make itin future somebody&apos;s clear duty to,see that all medical facilities are availableto all people; the placing of this duty on an organisation answerable to thepublic in the democratic way, while enjo3&apos;ing the fullest expert and pro-fessional guidance.
(3) Some temporary limitations of the full service inevitable e.g. indentistry (owing to insufficient dentists), in ophthalmology and perhaps else-where; but the design to be comprehensive from the outset, and to be ful-filled as fast as resources and man-power allow.(4) The first step to be the making of positive plans for each area of thecountry, determining what is needed for all people in that area; this to befollowed by measures to ensure that what is needed is then secured.(5) A combination, for all this, of central and local responsibility, toensure that both general national requirements and varying local require-ments are equally met.4. The administrative organisation; central and local.(1) Central.(i) Central responsibility to Parliament and the people to he with theMinister.(ii) At the side of the Minister, to be a new central and statutoryorganisation for voicing professional views on technical aspects of theservice generally; to be known as the Central Health Services Council; torepresent general and specialist medical practice, hospital organisation andother professional interests; to be appointed by the Minister in consultationwith those interests, and to choose its own chairman; to be consultative andnot executive; to advise the Minister not only on questions referred to it bythe Minister but also on its own initiative; the Minister to report annuallyto Parliament on the work of the Council.(iii) A special executive body to be also set up, composed in the mainof members of the medical profession; to be known as the Central medical board, and to act under the general direction of the Minister; to bethe &quot; employer &quot; body v/ith whom the general practitioner enters into con-tract in the new service, and to concern itself with the distribution and welfare of practitioners and assistants.(2) Local.(i) Local organisation to be based on the county and county borough councils, operating in their normal local government areas where possible,but combining as joint authorities over larger areas where necessary.(ii) Areas of suitable size and resources for the operation of a full hospital service of all kinds, to be designated by the Minister after consultation with local interests.(iii) For each of these new hospital areas a joint authority to be con-stituted, being a combination of the existing county and county borough councils in the area; in the few cases where the area may coincide withan existing county area, the authority to be the county council of that area.(iv) The new joint authority also to be charged with preparing an areaplan for the health service as a whole, not only the hospital service, inmanner described below.(v) Existing county and county borough councils, while combining forthese duties of the new joint authority, to be responsible severally for localclinic and domiciliary services not belonging to the hospital and consultantsphere within the general area plan; the responsibility for child welfare tobe assigned broadly on the same lines as responsibility for child education.General medical practice to be the subject of special organisation, partlylocal, partly central.(vi) In each joint authority area, to be a local consultative body for voicing professional guidance on technical aspects of the service; to be
known as the Local Health Services Council; to serve a similar purposelocally to the central professional body already described; to advise boththe joint authority and the county and county borough councils, and to be free to express advice and views to the Minister.5. The planning of the local services.(1) Each joint authority, in consultation with the local. professionalbody referred to and with others locally concerned, to prepare an &quot; areaplan &quot; for securing the comprehensive health service for its area; the plan to be based on an assessment of the needs of the area in all branches ofthe service, to propose how each of those needs should be met, and to besubmitted to the Minister.(2) The Minister to consider each area plan, and any representations madeto him by the local professional body or others affected, and to approve the pla&quot;n with or without modification; the plan, as approved, to be the operative plan for that area; to be the duty of all concerned to provide and maintain their services within the general framework of the plan; the plan to be modified or replaced from time to time, according to requirements, bythe same procedure.6. Provision of the various parts of the service under the plan.(1) Hospital and Consultant Services,(i) To be the duty of the joint authorities themselves to secure a com-piete hospital and consultant service for their area including sanatoria, isola-tion, mental health services, and ambulance and ancillary services inaccordance with the approved area plan.(ii) The joint authorities to do this both by direct provision and bycontractual arrangements with voluntary&apos; hospitals (or with other joint authorities) as the approved area plan may indicate.(iii) Powers of present local authorities, in respect of these services, topass to the joint authority, with all existing hospitals and similar institutions.(iv) The voluntary hospital system to continue side by side with thepublicly provided hospitals; voluntary hospitals, to participate, if willing todo so, as autonomous and contracting agencies; if so, to observe the approved area plan and to perform the services for which they contractunder that plan, and to receive various service payments.(y) All hospitals, municipal or voluntary, taking part in the service to observe certain national conditions (e.g. as to remuneration of nurses,appointment of consultants); these conditions being centrally prescribed.(vi) Special provision to be made for inspection of the hospital service,through selected expert personnel (some part-time) working in panels overdifferent parts of the country.(vii) Consultant services to be made available to all, at the hospitals,local centres or clinics, or in the home, as required; to be based on thehospital service, and arranged by the joint authority, either directly orby contract with voluntary hospitals under the approved area plan.(viii) Measures for improving the distribution of consultants, dealingwith methods of appointment&apos; and remuneration, and relating this toother branches of the new service generally, to be considered after thereport of the &quot; Goodenough Committee &quot; but general direction of changes to be:  (a) Consultants taking part to be remunerated in future (usuallyby part-time or. whole-time salary) by the particular hospital or hos-hospitals with which they are associated under the area plan; standards
Soof remuneration to be centrally settled in consultation with the profession.(b) New arrangements for securing proper standards for consultantappointments in the service, possibly through a professional organisa-. tion set up to advise all hospitals making appointments of senior staff.(2) General medical practice.(i) The Minister, with the new Central Medical Board, to undertakenationally the main arrangements for a general practitioner service for thecountry, through which anyone who wishes to do so can associate himself with a &quot; family doctor &quot; of his own choice and obtain the advice and treatment of that doctor at home or at his present consulting room or ata specially provided and equipped consulting room in a Health Centre,as the case may be.(ii) These central and national arrangements to cover terms of service,remuneration of doctors from public funds, and other general aspects of organisation, and the individual doctor to be in contract with the CentralMedical Board.(iii) The joint authority in each area to have the duty of:  (a) including in their area plan an assessment of the needs of their area in general medical practice;(b) keeping these needs under review and bringing to the notice01 the Minister and the Central Medical Board any general featuresor requirements of the general practitioner situation in the area whichthey consider to need attention;(c) ensuring that general medical practitioners taking part in theservice in the area are acquainted with hospital and consultant andother services available under the. area plan, and that they are able(as, under their terms of service, they would be required) to use those services for their patients.(iv) The county and county borough councils to be responsible for pro-viding, equipping and maintaining such Health Centres for the conduct ofgeneral medical practice in the new service as may be approved from time,to time by the Minister in respect of any part of their area and in suchcases to be joined in the doctor&apos;s contract with the Central Medical Board.(v) Future development to ,ir elude both new methods of &quot; grouped &quot;medical practice in Health Centres (and, where suitable, outside them)and familiar methods of &quot; separate &quot; practice; each being developed as experience proves best in each area. A high place in the scheme to begiven to a full and careful trial of the Health Centre method.(vi) Existing practitioners to be able to participate in the new service intheir present areas of practice, and where they do so from their ownconsulting rooms to be normally remunerated on a capitation basis(though other methods to be considered in certain cases if desired by thepractitioners themselves). Where they participate in group practice in health Centres, remuneration to be by salary or similar alternative.(vii) Practice in the public service not to debar a doctor from private practice for such patients as may still request this.(viii) Appropriate limits to be fixed to the number of persons whose carea particular doctor can undertake, taking into due account the extent ofprivate medical practice and the calls made upon a doctor&apos;s time by other public appointments; higher limits where assistants are engaged; moreregulation of the conditions of the employment of assistants in the service,
and a requirement that newly qualified doctors shall normally serve aperiod as assislants before practising on their own in the new service.(ix) New practitioners wishing to participate in the service, and exist-ing practitioners wishing to do so in new areas or new practices, to berequired to obtain the consent&apos;of the professional Central Medical Board to check the need for additional public practice in the area, and to ensure a reasonable -distribution of resources inside the public service.(x) Compensation for loss of selling value of practices to be payablewhere a doctor transfers his public practice into a Health Centre, or wherea public practice falling vacant is not allowed to be refilled by the CentralMedical Board.(xi) Superannuation to be provided for doctors practising at health centres and, if practicable, for other doctors participating in the service in &quot; separate &quot; practice.(xii) The question of the sale and purchase of public medical practices in future to be discussed more fully with the profession.(3) Clinic and other local services.(i) To be the duty of the joint authority to deal in its area plan withall necessary clinic and other local services (e.g. child welfare, ante-nataland post-natal clinics, home-nursing, health visiting, midwifery and others),and to provide for the co-ordination of these services with the other services in the plan.(ii) Administration of these local clinic and non-hospital services,however, to be normally the responsibility of the individual county and county borough councils which collectively make up the joint authority: the administration to be in accord with the general provisionsof the area plan.(iii) The exact allocation of responsibility between the joint authority and the individual county and county borough councils to be settled ineach case by the Minister in determining the area plan; but normally onthe principle that services belonging to the hospital and consultant spherefall to the joint authority, while other local and clinic services fall to theindividual councils.(iv) Child welfare duties always to fall to the authority responsible forchild education under the new Education Bill, but to be as much thesubject of the &quot; area plan &quot; as any other branch of the service.(v) New forms of service, e.g. for general dentistry and for generalcare of the eyes, to be considered with the professional and other interests concerned as soon as circumstances allow. In the case of dentistry, thereport of the Teviot Committee to be first awaited. -7. The service in Scotland.(1) The scope and objects of the service to be the same in Scotland as inEngland and Wales, and the foregoing proposals to apply generally to both countries but subject to the differences below.(2) Certain differences in detailed application in Scotland, due to specialcircumstances and geography and existing local government structure there;differences mainly affecting the arrangement of responsibility, central andlocal, for planning and carrying out the service.(3) Central responsibility to. rest with the Secretary of State, as the Ministerof the Crown responsible to Parliament for the health of the people of Scotland.A Central Health Services Council and a Central Medical Board to be set up,as in England and Wales.
(4) Local organisation to differ from that in England and Wales and to beon the following lines:  (a) Regional Hospitals Advisory Councils to be set up for each of fivebig regions; to consist of equal representation of the new local authorityJoint Hospital Boards (below) and of voluntary hospitals; also representa-tion of the Local Medical Services Committee (below) and of medical and medical-education interests; independant chairman to be appointed by secretary of State.Councils to be advisory to Secretary of State on the co-ordination ofthe hospital and consultant services in each region.(b) Joint Hospitals Boards to be formed by combinations of neighbour-ing local authorities (county councils and town councils of large burghs),to ensure an adequate hospital and consultant service in their areas;these to take over all responsibility for the hospital services of the con-stituent authorities (including services like the tuberculosis dispensaries,which essentially belong to the hospital and consultant field) and alsoto arrange with voluntary hospitals.These Joint Boards to prepare a scheme for the hospital service of their areas, to submit this to the Secretary of State, who will consult the regional Hospitals Advisory Council before deciding to approve oramend--it.(c) Education authorities (county councils and town councils of fourcities) to retain responsibility for school health service and clinics; existinghealth authorities (county councils and town councils of large burghs) toretain responsibility for the ordinary local clinic and similar services; thenecessary co-ordination to be secured (i) through their membership ofthe Joint Hospitals Boards and (ii) through the Local Medical services committee (below).Powers of Secretary of State to be strengthened to require local authori-ties to combine for any purpose proved necessary, after public localenquiry, for the efficiency of the new service as a whole.(d) Local Medical Services Committees to be set up over the same areas as the Joint Hospitals Boards; to be advisory bodies; to include repre-sentation of all the local health authorities and of local medical, dental,pharmaceutical and nursing professions and other interests; free toappoint smaller sub-committees and groups, as found desirable.These Committees to advise the Secretary of State on local administra-tion of the general practitioner service; also to provide liaison betweenthe different branches of the service.- (5) Central provision of Health Centres more suitable in Scotland owingto the smaller size of the problem and the special circumstances of geographyand distribution of population- with a power to the Secretary of State to delegate his functions in this respect to a local authority, where found desirable.8. Financial.(i) All advice and treatment under the new service, general and specialist, in the home, the consulting room or clinic or hospital, to be free of charge to the patient (except for certain possible charges in regard toappliances).(ii) Cost of the service to be met from both central and local public funds. These arrangements, as affecting the various local authorities andthe voluntary hospitals, are fully considered in a special financial memo-randum appended,
APPENDIX A.THE EXISTING HEALTH SERVICES.GENERAL SURVEY OF THE PRESENT SITUATION AND ITS ORIGINS.ENGLAND AND WALES.Before the nineteenth century there was little regular intervention by public authority in the personal health of the people, which was left to rest inthe main on private arrangements and on various forms of charity and voluntaryorganisation for relief. The early nineteenth century brought the beginning of full-scale attempts to protect and relieve the destitute (and as a corollary to tendthe destitute sick) and also a quickening of interest in the welfare of the youngergeneration, particularly in the supervision of child labour in industry. As thecentury went on, more attention began to be given to the environmental con-ditions of health, to sanitary services, drainage, water supply, street cleaning andthe whole make-up of public hygiene, and to the idea of local governmentresponsibility in matters of public health while measures for the prevention ofthe major infectious diseases, including notification and isolation, became moreand more the subject of public regulation and concern. It was not, however,until the present century that the public provision.of direct services for personal health began to get into its real stride, and began to evolve the wide variety of services which are now familiar like the services for maternity and child welfare,midwifery, tuberculosis, the health of the school, child, the National HealthInsurance scheme, venereal diseases, and the provision of general hospitals by public authority for others than the destitute sick.In general terms, the result is a complicated patch-work pattern of healthresources, a mass of particular and individual services evolved at intervals overa century or more but particularly during the last thirty or forty years and forthe most part coming into being one by one to meet particular problems, to pro-vide for particular diseases or particular aspects of health or particular sections ofthe community. Each, as it emerged, was shaped by the conditions of its time,by the limited purposes for which it was designed, and perhaps by the fashions of administrative and political thought current when it was designed. Most of these services, though progressively expanded and adapted as the years have gone on,are still broadly running on the lines laid down for them at the start and are administered largely, or partly, as separate and independent entities. The patch-work, however, contains some very good pieces well established and by nowrich in experience.It is worth looking at these principal pieces in more detail to make a survey of how the ordinary man and woman and child can at present get the variousmedical services which they need. -General Medical Care.To the individual the natural first-line resource in all matters of personal healthis the general practitioner the personal medical adviser, the &quot; family doctor.&quot;With - one important exception (and a few minor ones) the relationship ofthe ordinary member of the publft to the general medical practitioner hasbeen, and is now, a matter of private arrangement. He makes his own choice of doctor, from among those who happen to be accessible to him, seeks his advice and attention when he wishes to, and pays- whatever private fees the doctor is accustomed to charge him. The relationship is a purely personal onebetween doctor and patient, and no form of public organisation is involved in it.The general medical practitioner, for his part, pursues his profession privately andindividually. He decides for himself where he wishes to practise, he usuallyobtains the &quot; good-will &quot; of an existing practice by purchase from another practi-petitioner, and he practises in the open competitive market. He may choose to combine with other practitioners in a voluntary partnership and there is an increasing tendency to do so in recent years but that is an individual decision and a matter of business agreement. The traditional basis of general medical practice, in fact, is one of free and private buying and selling in which the Statedoes not intervene- apart from the provisions of the Medical Acts with regardto qualification and registration and professional conduct.
The earliest exception to this rule was the provision of a general practitioner-service under the poor law. An organisation designed for the &quot; destitute sick,&quot;and including a domiciliary service, was gradually built up throughout the nine-teenth century and still gives valuable aid to those in difficulty. Although gener-ally officered by part-time (or occasionally whole-time) District Medical Officers,it has in recent years been converted in some areas into a service of the &quot; panel &quot;type, in which all doctors practising in the locality can take a share. Apart fromthis limited service,-arrangements for general practitioner treatment were, up to1912, either of a purely private kind or were organised by Friendly Societies,medical clubs and similar organisations.The National Health Insurance service, instituted, in that year, formed part of the provision made by the National Health Insurance Actfor the protection of the bulk of the working population against lossof health and for the prevention and cure of sickness. Broadly speaking,its &quot; medical benefit&quot; extends to the whole insured population (some21,000,000 people) representing for the most part those employed under contracts of service whose income is less than  420 a year. These select from the localpanel of doctors their personal medical attendant, who can be consulted as andwhen the need arises, without fee, and from whom they can obtain such advice and treatment (including visits at their homes) as are within the ordinary scopeof the general practitioner. Similarly, they can obtain drugs which the doctor considers requisite and a limited class of surgical and medical appliances.Provision is also made for the issue of medical certificates free of charge. Anydoctor who so wishes has the right to take part in the service. The range of medical benefit provided by the scheme does not normally cover consultants orhospital services, although certain facilities for obtaining specialist advice anddiagnostic services in difficult cases are afforded. The scheme is designedin fact, for a limited object, which is to enable the great bulk of the employedpopulation to get advice and treatment and necessary medical certificates fromdoctors of their own choice, without the deterrent of fees. This object has, onthe whole, been fulfilled.Apart from the National Health Insurance scheme and the poor law, there is no public provision for general medical attention on any considerable scale. Thereare various special services for children and other limited groups, as will be seen.Also some adult members of the public are entitled to general advice and treat-ment under schemes for particular vocational groups (such as Post Officeemployees or the Police) some carried on by Government departments,others by local authorities, and others by large industrial concerns. some members of the public particularly in parts of the London area obtainadvice and treatment from the out-patient departments of hospitals and fromdispensaries of various types without going first to a general practitioner. Othersdo so through co-operative arrangements made in societies or clubs an example of which can be seen in the &quot; Public Medical Services &quot; set up in some areas,largely for the dependants of insured persons, on the initiative of the medical profession itself. A war-time development of a somewhat similar kind has beenthe arrangement made by the Government, through the Local Medical War Com-mittees of the profession, for the medical? attendance of evacuated school-children.Hospital and Consultant Services.For those who require hospital treatment, as in-patients or as out-patients, or who require specialist advice beyond the ordinary scope of the general medical practitioner, a wide range of hospital services is available. The individualmay, of course, choose to enter a private nursing home and to engage the servicesof a specialist to attend him there just as he may, for consultation, make purelyprivate arrangements with the specialist at his home or at the specialists con-suiting room. In such cases the whole matter is one of personal arrangement at private cost, in which no intervention of a publicly organised servicearises although the State intervenes to a limited extent to secure reasonablestandards by the registration and inspection of nursing homes. Similarly, theindividual may arrange to enter a private room or ward set aside in a voluntary
hospital for those who want to make their own arrangements at their own expense. Apart from any such private arrangements as these, the publiclook to the ordinary hospital services both for hospital treatment and forspecialist medical advice, usually arranging for either or both through their general medical practitioner in the first instance.There are two distinct systems of hospital provision in this country, runningside by side the voluntary hospitals and the public or municipal hospitals.They have quite separate origins and histories, and are quite differently organised and financed. In earlier years the two systems had little working contact with each other and each went its own way with its own kind of service to the public.In recent years there has been an increasing tendency for the two systems to getcloser together, to realise their common aims in the service of the public and the value of a greater degree of organised partnership in improving that service together. But in all questions of hospital provision and of future hospitalreorganisation it has to be clearly kept in mind that there are these two quitedistinct systems at the moment, and that both are strongly rooted and established,with their own traditions and experience. The way this has come about, and theextent to which each contributes in making up the present total service, are not always clearly kept in mind and are worth summarising.Until recent years the main burden of providing hospital treatment for acutemedical and surgical conditions (though not so much for infectious diseases ormental ills) was carried by the voluntary hospitals, and rested in fact uponvoluntary philanthropy rather than on publicly organised provision. The volun-tary hospital is, in essence, an independent charitable organisation, deriving itsmoney from the voluntary subscriptions or donations or endowments of benevolentindividuals or associations; it is administered by its own governing body or trusteesand provides its own service to the public in its own way, subject to the conditions laid down by its constitution. In origin/ a few of them can trace their existenceback to mediaeval ecclesiastical foundations, but. the great majority have comeinto being during the last two hundred years. There are, at the present day,more than a thousand voluntary hospitals in England and Wales, and they varyenormously in type and size and function. Some of them are large and power-ful general hospitals of the kind familiar in London and certain of the big cities,with distinguished specialists and consultants available, with first-class modern equipment and treatment facilities, sometimes associated with well-known medi-cal schools, and drawing their patients from areas wide afield as leading institu-tions in the medical world. Others are highly specialised hospitals, concentrating on particular kinds of diseases and conditions (such as eye conditions, or ear,nose and throat complaints, or diseases of the nervous system. Therest cover a wide and varying range of size and function, with varying degrees of specialist and other facilities, including a large number of small &quot; cottage &quot;hospitals served in the main by the local general practitioners and really function-ing as local nursing homes for the mutual convenience of doctor and patient.Something of the diversity of size and scope of the voluntary hospitals isevidenced by the fact that, of rather more than 900 hospitals in England andWales of which particulars were available before the war and which providedabout 77,000 beds, there were about 230 specialised hospitals dealing mainly withparticular diseases, and the general all-purpose hospitals numbered about 700.Of these 700 only some 75 were hospitals of more than 200 beds (and about 25 ofthese were teaching hospitals); some 115 of the rest provided between 100 and200 beds each; over 500 had less than 100 beds, and more than half of these hadless than 30 beds.The other arm of the present hospital services the hospitals provided directly by public authority out of public funds had its first roots partly in the earlypublic measures for protecting the sick poor, in the first half of the last century,and partly (a little later in that century) in measures which were taken to combatthe spread of epidemic infectious diseases. From these two strains there graduallyemerged, in recent years, the wider conception of providing through local govern-ment machinery and out of public funds a general hospital service no longerrelated only to the sick poor or to infectious diseases, but catering for the ordinarypublic and their ordinary hospital needs.
From the time of the earliest poor-houses it was usual to provide some sort ofpublic accommodation for the destitute sick. Out of the first horrors of the mixed workhouse there began to emerge the notion of the separate and specialsick ward, endorsed by the Poor Law Commissioners and adopted more and moreby the early Boards of Guardians; from this the wholly separate infirmary orpoor law hospital developed catering still in the main for the chronic and incirr-able or senile cases. Standards improved, the poor law flavour diminished, andthe interpretation of the &quot; destitute &quot; sick became elastic; the field of treatmentgrew and the poor law idea as a whole became outworn as the expanding publichealth services began to oust it. This long process of over a century culminatedat last, in 1930, in the final acceptance of the principle that general hospitalprovision was a proper activity of the major local health authorities,rather than of the poor law machinery.Since 1930 it has been the accepted function (though not the statutory duty)of the major local authorities the county and county borough councils to enter the field of general hospital provision for the ordinary hospital case, side by side with the voluntary hospitals already engaged in that field. Many of the earlierpoor law hospitals have been taken right out of the poor law sphere and converted to this new and wider function, and new hospitals have been built. Some ofthe older poor law hospitals still form part of the poor law service (which hasitself also passed into the hands of the county and county borough councils),but many even of these have lost their earlier poor law atmosphere. The resultof all this new activity is that, just before the war, there were in England andWales- quite apart from special hospitals for such conditions as maternity,tuberculosis, or infectious diseases nearly 70,000 beds in 140 general hospitalsmaintained by the local health authorities under public health powers, and1 nearly 60,000 more in 400 hospitals and institutions still administered under the poor law. This great pool of 130,000 beds represents a varied service, at every stage of development from the sick wards of an institution for the aged or chronicsick to the most modern and&apos; up-to-date of hospitals with every kind of specialdepartment and equipment and highly skilled staff.It has for some time been recognised that all these varying and independentlyprovided hospital facilities, both in the voluntary system . and in thatof the public authorities, need jx. great deal more co-ordinating, and somesupplementing, so as to ensure a right distribution of hospital accommodationaccording to local need -and so as to secure that all the types of specialisedand general work which the different hospitals are best qualified to perform arearranged in some better related scheme; in a word, to make the hospitals com-supplementary to each other in a combined. and balanced service.At present the hospital facilities to which any particular individual can getaccess, when in need, depend to a large extent on what kind of hospitals happen to be available in his area, on his ability if the right hospital is not at hand-to go perhaps a long way afield and arrange for admission to one elsewhere,and on the extent to which his local doctor has been able by his own initiative tomaintain personal contact with hospitals and consultants. It is not at presentthe duty of any public authority, central or local, to ensure that all the rightkinds of hospital facilities are available and reasonably accessible to him or that every general practitioner is readily able to obtain every kind of hospital orconsultant service which he is likely to need for his patients. The exercise bythe major local authorities of their power to provide hospitals and the activitiesof voluntary hospitals do between them often have the result that the righthospital is where it is wanted and do usually have the result that hospital provi-sion of some kind is available in every area. But these present powers and.activities do not extend to any duty to review all branches of the local hospital service and to see that they are so adjusted to each other and if necessary sosupplemented that the- total service available corresponds, both in kind and in quality, with the likely demands upon it. The anomalies of large waiting lists inone hospital and suitable beds empty at another, and of two hospitals in the same area running duplicated specialist centres which could be better concentrated inone more highly equipped and staffed centre for the area, are largely the resultof a situation in which hospital services are many people&apos;s business but nobody&apos;sfull responsibility.
When admitted to hospital in the ordinary way, the patient is usually expectedto pay what he can reasonably afford towards the cost of his treatment and accommodation there. Local authorities are required to make these charges(except in the case of infectious disease, where they have a discretion) and voluntary hospitals usually follow the same practice. Very often the patientcompounds for this liability by joining one of the many contributory schemes,associated with voluntary hospitals, in which he pays a small sum weekly and inreturn is paid for by the scheme&apos;s fund when he is in hospital. Those schemesmay apply only to a particular hospital or group of hospitals -on which he mustthen depend entirely or go elsewhere and pay what he can afford or they may(and this is the growing tendency in the more up-to-date schemes) entitle him tobe relieved of payment in any hospital, whether voluntary or belonging to apublic authority, in a wide variety of hospitals.On many of the existing hospitals the war-time Emergency Hospital Schemeof the Government has had a considerable effect. Seeking to use (and where necessary to improve) the services of the hospitals for various war-time purposes,this emergency service has temporarily entered the field, adding new buildings and extensions to the number of about 50,000 beds; up-grading surgical and-ray and other medical facilities; relating the hospitals one to another forthe interchange of patients according to their special needs; developing specialisedtreatment centres for fractures and rehabilitation, brain surgery, chestdisorders, neurosis and other purposes; and providing inter-hospital transport,country-branches and recovery and convalescent homes. It is a war-timeorganisation which would not suit the requirements of peace; but it will, in its. passing, have left improved resources-even entirely new hospitals where noneexisted before and above all experience of what it means to translate a collectionof individual hospitals into something of a related hospital, system.Rehabilitation.What has come to be known as &apos;&apos; rehabilitation &apos;&apos; is more a process or a methodthan a separate organisation or service. But its requirements, in moderntechnique, have ca.used it to be so often specially and separately considered inrecent years that it justifies special mention in this review.So far as it belongs to the sphere of the health services (it is partly a healthproblem, partly an industrial and vocational one) it rests on the principle thatthe actual mending or curing of an injury or disease is often not sufficient unless it is accompanied by a process of completely restoring the whole of the patient&apos;s previous capacities or doing so as completely as possible; i.e. restoring the wholeof muscle tone, of full function, of general health and strength, as well as cureof what was wrong. It involves various processes srtpplementary to ordinarytreatment, such as massage, exercise, electro-therapy and occupational therapy,and therefore it may often involve special accommodation and apparatus and staff. Thus, while in principle it has been accepted in good surgery and medicinefor a long time, it has still not become as- much part and parcel of hospital and medical practice as many think it ought to be, and it is legitimate criticism of the existing services that they are not yet organised on the whole (although there are brilliant exceptions in particular areas and institutions) to give thescope that ought in future to be given to the rehabilitation aspect of hospital and medical treatment.Considerable experiment has been conducted and considerable result achieved-in this direction by developments in particular hospitals and centres underthe Emergency Hospital Scheme. An important review of the whole subject was published recently in a report of an Interdepartmental Committee on the Re-habilitation and Resettlement of Disabled Persons, and this report recommendedgreatly increased attention to the rehabilitation principle in any future arrange-ments of the hospital and health services. The subject is not one for any detailed review here, but it has to be mentioned if only to note what hashitherto been a deficiency in existing services and to keep in mind the necessityfor developing it in any reorganisation.Infectious Diseases and Isolation Hospitals.Apart from sanitary and other improvements, public action in relation toinfectious diseases was first taken in the Vaccination Act of 1840, providing public
facilities for vaccination against smallpox. In r853 provision was made forpenalties against parents for failure to have their children vaccinated, and aseries of enactments on the vaccination question followed right up to the presentcentury. Since 1898 it has been possible for a parent or guardian who believes that vaccination would prejudice a child&apos;s health to withdraw the child fromthe application of the Acts. At the present time only one-third of thechildren born each year arc vaccinated. It is probable that the time hascome to amend the law, and to substitute for compulsory vaccination a systemof free vaccination for all through the family doctor, the clinic services, orotherwise. This is the method adopted during the present war in organising the immunisation of children against diphtheria. Supplies of the necessary toxoidhave been provided free, and immunisation has been performed normally without charge to parents, wdiile every method of publicity has been used to encourage them to take advantage of the facilities provided. By the end of 1942 about half the child population under 15 had been immunised.Infectious diseases are the subject of a special service of treatment in isolation hospitals, which is provided by the councils of the boroughs and urban and rural districts, but not usually the county councils. This separatelyorganised service was one of the earliest of the local government medical services totake shape as far back as 1866. Before that, some of the charitable institutionshad provided specially for fever or smallpox patients, and the invasions of Asiaticcholera which began in 1831 had reinforced the arguments of the Poor Law Com-missioners that there should be more regular provision made for infectious diseases;but only temporary measures had been taken during epidemics under orders madeby the Privy Council. The first real powers to provide public isolation hospitalsbegan with the Sanitary Act of 1866, and from then on the local authorities of thesanitary districts which became in time the county borough, borough and urban and rural district councils began to develop, severally or in combination, thesystem of the separate treatment of infectious diseases in isolation hospitals which exists to-day. In London a special Metropolitan Asylums Board was created in1867 for the central provision of asylums for certain of the sick poor, and it became in time the general provider of infectious diseases hospitals for the metropolis, until its services were finally transferred &quot;to the London CountyCouncil in 1930. Outside London, in spite of the general tendency to attachpublic hospital provision to county councils and county borough councils, thecounty councils were not, prior to 1929, brought very directly into the infectious diseases service, though they were given certain powers by the IsolationHospitals Acts, 1893 and 1901, which have since been repealed. In 1929, bythe Local Government Act, they were given the function of drawing up a localscheme for adequate isolation accommodation in each county, in consultationwith the county district authorities. The carrying out of the schemes hasnormally remained a function of the latter authorities, though occasionally a county council has undertaken the provision for the whole or part of a county.In 1889 the sanitary authorities were authorised to make certain infectious diseases notifiable in their respective districts, if they^so desired; before thatnotification applied only in a few areas where special powers had been conferred.Ten /years later the notification principle was made universal throughout Englandand Wales for these diseases. Other diseases, such as tuberculosis, have since been made notifiable by general regulation of the Minister. Local authorities can also, with the Ministers approval, make local additions to the list.The present situation is that there are some 1,500 local authorities with powersto provide for the hospital treatment of infectious diseases (including smallpox)in their areas. They do not all make separate and independent provision, andthe obvious good sense of pooling resources so as to plan a more useful and economical service for larger areas has resulted in many of them combininginto formal Joint Boards or less formal joint committees for the purpose. About800 of them have so combined, into about 160 Joint Boards apart from theother less formal combinations referred to so that the principle of planningover more suitably sized areas already exists to a considerable extent in this service.Altogether there were, just before the war, something like 38,000 beds in isolation hospitals provided under the infectious diseases and smallpox service,
and they were to be found in some 810 separate hospitals, about 630 of which contained less than 50 beds.. The hospitals thus tend to be small (although thereare well-known exceptions) and they vary considerably in quality. Some of theprovision is very good of its kind, much of it reasonably satisfactory; but ingeneral the small and separate hospital for infectious diseases is unecono-mical, viewed as a medical and nursing organisation; and for most infectious diseases it is to be regarded as less satisfactory in future planning from themedical point of view than either the provision of larger units or of separateblocks inside the bigger organisation of the general hospitals.Admission to infectious diseases hospitals is in many areas quite free of charge for any of the inhabitants of the area-as distinct from the ordinary practiceof recovery of costs according to ability to pay, which applies in the general hospital services.Tuberculosis. -Public measures for the care of the tuberculous are organised under aseparate machinery, and in many cases by different authorities from those con-cerned with general infectious diseases. Before 1912 there existed some 5,000or 6,000 tuberculosis beds in sanatoria or hospitals, mostly administered by voluntary organisations or private individuals, and mostly quite small. Theareater part of them had been established within the previous ten years or so.a few local authorities had . provided sanatoria themselves, and some weretreating tuberculosis cases in smallpox hospitals or infectious diseases hospitalswhen accommodation was available. There were also about 50 tuberculosisdispensaries in existence. From 1912 onwards public intervention in the treatmentof tuberculosis began to quicken and in that year all forms of the disease weremade for the first time notifiable. Local authorities were encouraged by ex-chequer grants to make better provision for the treatment of tuberculous personsin-their areas, and sanatorium benefit under the National Health Insurancescheme was designed to secure that insured persons, if they were found to besuffering from the disease, should get the advantages of sanatorium and othertreatment whether or not they could afford to pay for it.The strain of the 1914-18 war was reflected in an increased incidence in the disease and there was a heavy demand for accommodation, in particular for mendischarged from the Forces. This Jed to increased exchequer assistance which resulted in further provision of sanatoria and other accommodation. In 1921,Parliament imposed a general duty on the county and county borough councils to make arrangements for the treatment of tuberculosis, this legislation beinglater incorporated in the Public Health Act of 1936. From these beginningsthere has emerged a strong and still developing special service dealingwith all aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of the disease and providing a considerable amount of supplementary help and after-care tothose suffering from it. The county and county borough councils fulfil their duties partly by their own direct provision of dispensaries, sanatoria and other institutions, partly by arrangements which they make with voluntary andother agencies. At the outbreak of the present war there were some 28,000regular beds in tuberculosis institutions, with many more available in approvedinstitutions for use when required. About 400 sanatoria were provided by. thelocal authorities directly, and some 270 by other agencies. These sanatoria arenot usually very large, only about 30 having more than 200 beds.Apart from actual diagnosis and treatment, the service provides in a degreevarying from area to area, and partly through voluntary Care Committees or similar organisations a variety of supplementary services dealing with additionalcomforts, extra nourishment and clothes, training for employment, help inobtaining suitable housing, dental care, and other matters. Valuable pioneer workin rehabilitation and resettlement of the tuberculous has been done by a small number of voluntary organisations, eminently in two well-known village settlementsand tuberculosis colonies. Local authorities have made full use of these facilities,just as for suitable types of case they have linked up with the training and settlement resources of the Ministry of Labour and National Service. Increasinginterest has recently -been taken in the rehabilitation of the tuberculous patient
(although hampered at the moment by the restricted conditions of war), andalso in new aids to early detection and diagnosis afforded by mass miniature radio-graphy. Another recent advance has been the scheme for the payment of allow-ances to patients under observation or treatment, in order to encourage early re-course to treatment where financial responsibilities might otherwise be an obstacletending to delay it.For the exercise of their duties a few local authorities have corn-bined with each other in seven Joint Boards. Some of these boards have taken over all the tuberculosis services of their constituentauthorities; some only undertake the joint management of particular institutions.A unique experiment in large-scale combination has been in operation in Walesfor the last 30 years, in the King Edward VII Welsh National Memorial Associa-tion. This was established in 1910, as part of a national campaign againsttuberculosis in Wales, and its special constitution (under a Charter of Incorpora-tion) provides for the representation of all the county and county borough councils in Wales, and also includes co-opted members, members nominated by theMinister of Health and others. It provides dispensaries and visiting stations and some 2,000 beds in its own sanatoria and hospitals, and also- arranges for accommodation through other agencies.The tuberculosis service even after allowing for the indirect effects of improved housing and food and environmental conditions generally- -has verytangible results to its credit over the last twenty years, reflected in improvements in the rate of mortality from the disease. It tends to be administered as aseparate entity, perhaps not enough related to the diagnosis and treatment ofother chest and respiratory conditions or to the work of the general hospitals,because it has come into being as a separately organised service with one particular objective.Venereal Diseases. .A special service for the early diagnosis and treatment of venereal diseases has,since 1916, been the responsibility of the county and county borough councils.It provides some 200 out-patient clinics and centres (usually by arrangement with local hospitals, sometimes independently) for free and confidential diagnosisand treatment for all, irrespective of place of residence or circum-stances. Hospital beds and hostels are usually available for in-patient treatment if required. -During the war the service has been supplemented by arrangements made, particularly in rural areas, under which suitably qualifiedgeneral practitioners give free treatment in their own consulting rooms. Doctorsin general practice are always at liberty and are encouraged to use the laboratory-tory and other resources of the service free of charge and to consult the expertmedical officers of the service on any case under treatment.Cancer.Just before the present war the Cancer Act of 1939 put upon the county and county borough councils a new special duty, to see that facilities for thediagnosis and treatment of cancer were available to meet the needs of their areas.The Act contemplated a new and comprehensive service for detecting andtreating the disease, based on a local scheme which would utilise existing resources(in voluntary hospitals and elsewhere) and would supplement them, as necessary,with new diagnostic centres and with additional treatment facilities. It was expected that, in many cases, it would be necessary for county and countyborough councils to combine in order to operate an effective scheme.over a &quot;widerarea, and provision for such combination was included in the Act. The wholeservice would be backed by arrangements for access to a centralised&quot; supplyof radium organised by the National Radium Trust and Radium Commission.The outbreak of war immediately after the Act was passed, however, prevented the new service from materialising except for a few interim schemes whichhave been started in some areas: Some special war-time arrangements, designedto relieve some of the cancer centres in certain large towns, have been made through the Emergency Hospital Scheme, but these do not properly form partof the present review.
Mental Health Services.Provision for the caxe and treatment of persons suffering from mental disorderis made by local authorities under the Lunacy and Mental Treatment Acts,1890 to 1930. The local authorities concerned are the councils of counties and county boroughs, and of 15 non-county boroughs. Many of the functions areobligatory, particularly as regards provision for certified patients. The powers conferred on local authorities in regard to provision for voluntary patients and out-patient diagnosis and treatment are permissive; but this part of the service has in fact developed rapidly since the passing of the Mental Treatment Act oi1930. In 1941. 35 per cent, of the admissions to public mental hospitals werevoluntary patients! Local authorities are required by these Acts to exercise -all their powers and duties through Visiting Committees which have powers inregard to staff and finance that give them a certain measure of independence.This arrangement is a survival of an Act of 1845. Three county councils London,Middlesex and Surrey have by local Act modified this arrangement so as tobring the committee dealing with this service into line with the position normallyoccupied by statutory committees of local authorities.In this service combination between authorities is a common feature. Thereare three Joint Boards established under local Acts. These provide for the combination of the county council with the county boroughs in the county inLancashire, the West Riding of Yorkshire and Staffordshire. Joint action hasbeen taken under the provision of the Lunacy Act by a large number of counties and - county boroughs for the provision and maintenance of a mental hospital to serve the combined area. Of 101 public mental hospitals (accommodat-ing some 130,000 patients) 42 are managed by a Joint Board or by a combination of two or more local authorities. The provision of a public mental hospitalmust clearly be entrusted to an authority covering a considerable area. Theaverage number of beds required per 10,000 of population is about 32. Theoptimum size of a public mental hospital is between 1,000 and 1,200 beds, andit has been found that when the number of beds in such an institution is below500 it tends to become uneconomical in&apos;management.Under the Lunacy and Mental Treatment Acts a considerable number of patients are treated in private institutions. Some 2,500 are in registered hospitals(i.e. private institutions supported partly by voluntary contributions or charitablebequests) and rather more in licensed houses, i.e., private profit-making establish-ments, licensed under, the Lunacy Act. There are about 12,500 persons ofunsound mind in the public assistance institutions and public health hospitals.Provision for the care of mental defectives is made under the mental deficiency Acts, 1913 to 1938. The local authorities concerned are the county and county borough councils. For the execution of the Acts these councils arerequired to appoint a committee for the care of defectives, some members ofwhich may be co-opted. Certain of the functions are obligatory while others are permissive. The local authorities are required to make arrange-ments to ascertain what persons within their areas are defective and subject tobe dealt with under the Mental Deficiency Acts. The service covers provisionfor institutional care for patients who need it and community care for defectiveswho are placed under guardianship or supervision: There are some 37,000 mental defectives&apos; in certified institutions, and &quot;about 5,000 under guardianship and37,000 under statutory supervision. Some 9,500. are in public assistance institutionsapproved for the reception of mental defectives.Institutional provision under the Act generally is considered to be inadequate.The operation of the principal Act of 1913 was checked at its inception bythe outbreak of the last- war, and further developments are essential if anadequate service is to be provided. Here again joint action is fairly common, 13out of a total of 61 certified institutions being carried on by Joint Boards orJoint Committees. Some of the largest certified institutions have been providedby organisations other than local authorities; and there are a number of smallcertified houses and approved homes which are privately owned.The central supervision of the mental health services is exercised by the Boardof Control, which was reorganised under the provisions of the Mental TreatmentA.ct, 1930. The members of the Board are appointed by the Crown, on therecommendation Of the Minister of Health, with the exception of the legal
member, who is appointed on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor. TheMinister appoints the Chairman, and the appointment of the staff of the board is also subject to his approval. He is responsible for the presentation of theBoard&apos;s estimate in Parliament, and anwers questions in the House of Commonsrelating to the mental health services. He is consulted, and his directions are taken by the Board, on all questions of major policy. The Board exercisesindependently of the Minister certain quasi-judicial functions conferred on themby statute in relation to the discharge of individual patients.Maternity and Child Welfare.The health of the expectant or nursing mother and of the child under five whois not attending school is the subject of a specially organised maternity and child welfare service. This service is mainly a development of the present century,and particularly of the years between the two great wars. There were beginningsin the latter part of the nineteenth century, when concern about the high infantdeath rate led to the start of a health visiting service of women workers(volunteers at first, then professional and qualified visitors) who advised motherson infant welfare in their homes; it led also to the establishment of special depotsor centres, where the mothers could attend for advice, and for milk and other special necessities. This work was made easier, and the way for a more organisedservice was paved, by making the notification of births compulsory -a process which began in 1907 and was extended in 1915. The real foundation of the presentservice was, however, the Maternity and Child Welfare Act of 1918.The service is provided by local welfare authorities, which may be countycouncils or county borough councils or minor authorities according to circum-stances which need not be elaborated here. The actual result is that outside london there are nearly 400 separate local welfare authorities, of which 60 arecounty councils, 83 county borough councils, 162 borough councils, 63 urban district councils, and 10 rural district councils. In London the Common Councilof the City and the 28 metropolitan borough councils are the welfare authorities.The service is not a duty of these authorities, but a power although in practiceall of them provide it, in varying degree. It is concerned to provide medical andgeneral advice and attention (but not treatment, except for a few minor ailments)to the young child and its mother, before the child&apos;s birth and afterwards until it is five years old or until it attends school. The service includes the provisionof ante-nataj and post-natal clinics and welfare centres, where attendance is forthe most part free and advice and minor treatment are given, the supply of milk and special foods, and the visiting and advice of health visitors at the home.The close connection between this service and the school medical service, whichis referred to below, has always been recognised and under the Local Govern-ment Act, 1929, the Minister has power, on representations made by a council which is the education authority, to transfer the welfare functions to that council.When the two services are in the hands of the same body they are usually linkedclosely with each other.For her actual confinement the expectant mother may be helped by the welfareauthority through their own provision or through arrangements made by themwith other agencies-to get admission to a bed in a maternity home or hospital.She may, alternatively, be confined in accommodation provided as part of thegeneral hospital services. Or again she may, and commonly does, have her con-finement at home, and in this case there is a separately established midwiferyservice which has grown up under the Midwives Acts 1902-1936 in the hands oflocal supervising authorities. These for historical reasons may or may not bethe same as the welfare authorities; there are in fact 188 of them and they include62 county councils, 83 county borough councils, 39 borough councils and 4 urban district councils. Their original duties (which explain their title) were to supervise the practice of independent midwives in accordance with the professional rules ofthe Central Midwives Board; but since 1936 they have been charged to see that anadequate service of domiciliary midwives is available in their area for those whoneed it, and they do this either by arrangement with voluntary organisations orby themselves directly engaging and employing midwives. Of some 16,000midwives in practice, nearly 2,700 are directly employed by the local authorities as domiciliary midwives and over 5,200 are in the employment of voluntary
bodies, usually county or district nursing associations. Many midwives, particu-larly in country areas, combine midwifery work with home, nursing and healthvisiting.notwithstanding the complication of the system, the quality of the maternity and child welfare and midwifery services is in general high, although they varyin scope considerably from area to area. Results, reflected in lower maternal andinfant mortality, have been striking and well reward the growing efforts of theservice in its relatively short development between the two wars. The commonestground of criticism is that it is divided up among too many separate agencies and kept too much apart from the related, fields of the family doctor and thehospital and specialist services.Home Nursing.Home nursing forms a most important branch of the health services, and onewhich is almost entirely the concern of voluntary organisations. Local authoritieshave limited powers to employ nurses for nursing at home patientssuffering from infectious diseases, or expectant or nursing mothers or children under five suffering from various conditions, but they have no general power toprovide a home nursing service and the number of nurses employed directly by them is very small. Within the limits of their responsibilities local authoritieslave, however, used extensively the services of the voluntary organisationsproviding home nurses, and they have also assisted them financially underpowers, originally derived from the poor law, enabling them to make sub-prescriptions and donations to these bodies.The home nursing service is for the most part provided through districtnursing associations, the majority of which are affiliated directly or through theappropriate County Nursing Association to the Queen&apos;s Institute of DistrictNursing and are under the supervision of the Institute. The district nurse is afamiliar and welcome figure, particularly in country areas. In co-operation withthe doctor she visits, the patient&apos;s homes, tends the chronic sick and the injured,and acts as adviser and educator in health matters. In many districts she actsalso as midwife and health visitor by arrangement with the local authority. Inall some 8,000 district nurses are at work over the whole of England and Wales.The income of the associations is derived from subscriptions and donations,payments made by patients directly or through a contributory scheme, and grants from local authorities.. The proportion received from public funds hasincreased in recent years, and especially since the Midwives Act 1936 placed onsupervising authorities the duty of providing a domiciliary midwifery service.This duty is frequently discharged by the district nursing associations in returnfor a grant from the authority.There is little doubt that, with some development, and with closer co-ordina-tion with other branches of the health services, home nursing could play an even greater and more useful part. The need here is for extending and strengthen-ing a service which has fully proved its value, and for linking it intimately withgeneral medical practice and with hospital treatment.The health of the school child.For the school child, over the age of five, or from the time of his first attendingschool, there has gradually developed during the present century a special schoolmedical service. Towards the end of the nineteenth century certain special provision was made for the care of blind, deaf, defective and epileptic children;but the origin of the school medical service may be traced directly to theReport of the Interdepartmental Committee on Physical Deterioration whichwas issued a few years after the South African War. As a result of this Reportihe Education (Administrative Provisions) Act was passed in 1907 setting up a regular system of medical inspection and empowering authorities to providecertain types of treatment. From then onwards, a system of increasing medicalinspection and care of the health of the school child has been steadily built up.It is now based mainly on the provisions of the Education Act of r92i and is oneof the subjects falling within the scope of the Education Bill now beforeParliament.
The operations of the present school medical service are broadly of three kinds.First, it provides for the regular medical inspection of all children in public elementary schools, in secondary schools, and in certain other schools. Second,it provides for the medical treatment, as well as inspection, of children in public elementary schools but in regard to other schools there is no obligation (only a power) to provide treatment. Third, it enables the educational system, withits regular contact with parent and child, to influence both in principles ofhealthy child life, and to assist and guide them in securing that the child resortsto the kinds of medical treatment or care that it may need. The first and last ofthese functions are essentially aspects of the educational system, as such, andit is the second personal medical treatment that is of most interest for thepurpose of the   present  review.Responsibility for arranging this medical treatment rests with the local educa-tion authorities. There are at the moment, for elementary education, 315 0fthese, and they include counties and county boroughs and certain non-county boroughs and urban districts; for higher education, there are 146 of these, allcounties and county boroughs. The present provision made by local educationauthorities for medical treatment varies considerably in some areas dealing only with the treatment of teeth, eyes, ears, nose and throat, and minor ailments;in others extending to such matters as orthopaedic treatment and certain pro-vision for rheumatic cases and for maladjusted children. The authorities arerequired to recover the cost of treatment from the parents, unless they are satis-fied that, this would not be reasonable. Some of the treatment activities areconducted in the schools themselves, some at clinics, provided for the purpose bythe local education authorities, some by arrangements made between these authorities and hospitals or other independent agencies.The local education authorities&apos; organisation for these purposes includesschool medical officers, whole time or part time, the chief of whom is in nearly all cases also the medical officer of health of the local authority concerned andcombines his school functions with his general public health duties; it also includesschool nurses, who are able to&quot; do much of the follow-up work in direct contact with the home and the parents (and who may combine their duties withthose of a health visitor) and school dentists and other technical officers. a valuable activity of the education authorities, side by side with this medicalwork, is the provision of good school meals and extra nourishment. This hasbeen greatly&apos; expanded since the beginning of the present war, is no longerlimited (as it was in earlier days) to children whose parents are necessitous or who cannot readily get to their homes at mid-day, and will remain an important feature in the proposed educational reorganisation.The central supervision of the school medical service rests with the Boardof Education, under powers delegated by the Ministry of Health, and a close association of its work with general public health policy is assured by the two departments enjoying the services of a single Chief Medical Officer, and byregular arrangements made through him for the co-ordination of the medicalwork at the centre in both fields.Dental Services.The existing publicly organised dental services.are of several kinds, and applyto various classes or groups of the&apos; population.Through the National Health Insurance scheme many but not all of the21,000,000 persons insured under the scheme can get what is knownas &quot; dental benefit &quot;. In fact, nearly two-thirds of them, or some30 per cent, of the population, are probably eligible for this benefit, whichfirst began to be provided in 1921. It does not take the form of direct publicprovision of dental treatment, but of a money payment of the whole or a partof the approved cost of treatment.&apos; The individual obtains treatment for himself from any dentist who is willing to treat him, under certain conditions and at certain scales of fees which are centrally regulated by the scheme. Mostdentists in private practice are willing to accept the &quot; dental benefit &quot; patientin this way, although there is no obligation to do so and no &quot; panel &quot; systemcomparable to that on the medical side of the Insurance Scheme.    Whether
&quot; dental benefit &quot; is obtainable by any insured person, depends upon the ability of the Approved Society (or branch) to which he belongs to make payments forthis benefit out of its surplus funds. Although probably about 13,000,000 people are eligible for this benefit, it is noteworthy that only some six or seven per cent,of them actually claim it in any given year.Under the maternity and child welfare service most of the local welfareauthorities arrange-in varying degree for dental treatment for expectant and nursing mothers and, where necessary, for children under five. The majority do this by providing a service directly, at their own welfare clinics (or at schoolclinics dealing with older children), others by arranging for a service throughprivate dentists or at hospital. The scope of the service given varies from area to area and includes the provision of dentures in the majority of cases. Nocharge is usually made for fillings or extractions, but for dentures most of theauthorities recover what the mother can reasonably afford. This service datesback to the Maternity and Child Welfare Act of rgi8, though its main develop-ment is more recent.Dental treatment is also provided as part of the arrangements for the treat-ment of tuberculosis, by the county and county borough councils dealing withthat disease. Here the main object is to deal with cases where the state of theteeth prevents the patient from getting the full benefit of tuberculosis treatment(e.g. by interfering with proper nourishment) and, although this limitation is not too strictly observed, the arrangements are none the less only an ancillary activity of the main tuberculosis service. The arrangements vary locally, being some-times provided directly at the sanatoria themselves, sometimes at other centresby the dentists employed for the maternity and other services described, sometimesby arrangement with private dentists.In the schools the school medical services of the local education authoritiesprovide dental inspection and treatment, in varying degree. School dental officersand dental attendants and other staff are appointed directly by the authorities,the work is done at the. schools or in clinics, or by arrangement at other premises.There is no statutory restriction on the scope or nature of the treatment which can be given although it will be remembered that the school medical treatment service is at present a duty of the authorities only in the case ofelementary schools, and a discretionary power in other cases. In actual fact, the dental service provided (although every local education authority has a dentalscheme of some kind) varies within wide limits, and as a whole it cannot yet besaid (in the view of the Board of Education) to represent anything like a fully adequate service for the school child.Apart from these publicly organised services the individual citizen must depend,for his dental care, on his own private arrangements. He may have access eitherto special dental hospitals (where these exist), or to some of the general hospitalswhere he will normally be asked to pay what he can reasonably afford, or he may.use certain facilities which some business houses or industrial organisations providefor their own employees, or some charitable or voluntary organisation affordingfacilities in his neighbourhood. Otherwise he usually seeks treatment privatelyfrom a dental practitioner in the ordinary way; or if he is in serious financial needand requires urgent treatment he may seek the assistance of the poor law, whichin most areas will arrange for essential treatment in the last resort.Ophthalmic Services.The position in regard to the public provision of ophthalmic services is verylike that in regard to dental services. &quot; Ophthalmic benefit &quot; under the national health Insurance scheme is the principal method of obtaining ophthalmic advice and treatment and spectacles, and about half the insured groups, or some 25 percent, of the population, are eligible ,for benefit. There are two ways in whichspectacles are obtained either through a medical practitioner with special experi-ence of ophthalmic work who normally gives a prescription for any necessaryspectacles to be made by a dispensing optician, or through a sight-testing optician.The Approved Society (or branch) which provides ophthalmic benefit is requiredto pay the cost of ophthalmic treatment up to a maximum amount, the cost of an authorised ophthalmic examination, and the whole or part of the cost of spectaclesif they are needed.
bbThe next most important channel of treatment is that open to schoolchildrenthrough the school medical service, where the arrangements are again analogous to those made for dental treatment. Apart from this service, only partial andirregular public facilities are available, for example through the out-patientdepartments of some special and general hospitals or in the last resort through the poor law. Otherwise the citizen must rely on what private arrangements he isable to make with a medical practitioner or optician.Industrial Medical Services.In addition to the services so far described there are various medical activitiesassociated specially with industry and employment, which need to be mentionedin this general picture although they are not primarily concerned with the personal medical advice and treatment of the individual but much more withgeneral welfare and the environmental conditions of his work. Although theycan all be referred to loosely as &quot; industrial medical services &quot;, they vary considerably in kind.First, the Factory Acts provide for arrangements for factory inspection whichare now the responsibilits; of the Ministry of Labour and National Service (havingbeen transferred to that Department from the Home Office in 1940) and which include medical as well as other Inspectors. The history of the direct intervention by the State in industrial welfare and working conditions is a long one, andmost of it is not relevant for the present purpose. Sufficient to say that it has its origin, well over a century ago, in the appointment after 1802 of factory&quot; Visitors &quot; by the Justices of the Peace (mainly to enforce the legal require-ments affecting the employment of juvenile labour) and that this arrangement was superseded by the first Government inspectorate of factories after the FactoryAct of 1833, from which the line of succession of the present system can be moreor less directly traced. The first appointment of a medical inspector was not made until about the end of the 19th century; but the medical side of the factory inspectorate has since developed into an important and well-known arm of theservice, and now occupies the whole-time services of more than a dozen medicalinspectors. In addition, however, the Inspectorate has, for over 100 years, beenassisted by part-time doctors (formerly called Certifying Surgeons, now ExaminingSurgeons, and now numbering about 1,700) whose duties included the investigation,on behalf of the Department, of cases of accident and industrial disease as wellas investigating the physical suitability of juveniles for factory employment and periodically examining workers employed in various unhealthy processes in connection with preventive measures (including, where found necessary, the suspension of individuals from the particular kind of work). Their investigation of accidents (but not of cases of disease, poisoning, gassing, and other special cases) was dropped in 1916, but the other sides of their work have been developing.This organisation is not designed to provide personal medical treatment and advice to the individual worker; it is designed as an integral part of the highlytechnical machinery for promoting, fundamentally through the employer, safety,health and welfare in factories and other premises within the scope of the inspector.Next, industrial concerns often appoint works medical officers, full-time or part-time, who are in a rather different position. An intermediate kind of case is where the firm arrange for the Examining Surgeon to carry out additionalfunctions at the works, beyond those for which they are legally required to employ him, so that he is substantially a part-time works doctor. These&quot; works doctors &quot; are engaged mainly to keep an expert eye on the medicalaspects of the factory&apos;s work and hygiene, on the effects of environment uponthe health of the workers, on the wise adjustment of types of work to the workers&apos;capacity, on arrangements for dealirig with accidents and emergencies, and generally for the giving of proper medical advice to the factory management.Before the war, arrangements of this kind were often encouraged by the factory inspectorate, and the Factories Act of 1937 gave wider powers to the HomeSecretary to order employers to make arrangements for medical suoervision intheir factories. Further, in 1940, the Minister of Labour and National Servicemade an Order, under Emergency Powers, requiring munitions and other firms to appoint works doctors if directed to do so.   Formal directions under the
Order have not been found necessary; but, since it was made, many more, firms have in fact appointed whole-time or part-time works doctors, so that &quot;there arenow some 175 whole-time doctors of this kind and about 700 exercising substantialmedical supervision in the factories on a regular part-time basis. The &quot; worksdoctors &quot; do not, any more than the Factory Inspectorate, exist primarily as a personal medical service; but in connection with their functions of advising the management and &quot;dealing with preventive and first-aid measures in the factorythey often provide, incidentally and as a matter of common-sense utility, acertain amount of useful personal medical advice to the factory employees on thegpQ-t perhaps particularly in war-time with its reduced opportunities for ordinary medical consultation outside working hours and its greater need foruninterrupted attendance at a place of work.The Ministry of Supply, in its capacity of factory employer, has on similarprinciples developed a medical service in connection with its Royal Ordnance Fac-tories. This service, as might be expected in a large industrial undertaking, includes a central organisation concerned with the general problems of the particular classesof factory under consideration, in which medical and other technical experts play their part, combined with a service of works doctors who look after conditions at the individual works in conjunction with other experts there, and. whoincidentally, as in other cases, give a certain amount of personal medical advice.Similarly, but on a smaller scale,, the Air Ministry and Admiralty make arrange-ments for medical services at their civilian industrial establishments.For the mining industry, the Ministry of Fuel and Power has found it increasing desirable to enlist the medical expert in its national organisationdealing with working conditions and welfare in the industry, and it also encouragesgreater use in the mines themselves of medical advice on the &quot; works doctor &quot;principle. These activities also involve some entry into the field of personalmedical care, but they do&apos;not set out to provide any full separate medical service. The miner, like other industrial workers, is within the scope of theNational Health insurance scheme and has recourse to hospital and other services on the basis already described. The Miners Welfare Commission hasalso been active in mining areas, in assisting in the provision of additional facilities (such as X-ray installations or   physio-therapy centres at hospitals).Generally, in these and other industrial medical services, the picture is not one of personal doctoring and individual health advice organised in vocationalgroups. It is not a question of separately organised medical treatment services for classes of industrial workers as distinct from the rest of the population. Withlew exceptions (like the arrangements for the police and for certain Post office workers, referred to under the paragraphs on general medical attention above)the main health and treatment services, already summarised in this paper(National Health Insurance, the local authority services, the &quot;hospitals, and soon) apply in the main to the people or to sections of the people irrespective of their particular form of vocation or employment for the most part equally to the worker in the field or in the mine or in the factory or elsewhere. The&quot; industrial &quot; medical services are primarily concerned with enlisting the&quot; medicalexpert in the supervision of general industrial welfare and organisation. Theyare not a direct personal treatment service, though to the extent indicated theyare sometimes concerned incidentally with personal advice or limited trea.tment.General.This, then, is a broad outline of the picture of the health and medical sendees- the main picture, but not by any means the whole picture. A full review wouldhave to detail the multitude of voluntary and private and semi-public efforts ofa host of associations, trusts, societies, clinics, institutions and other organisa-tions and groups, which have sprung from private initiative or from publiccharity over a long period of years. It would have to analyse the many localvariations of both statutory and non-statutory services, the many different kinds of experiment in grouping and combination of services locally, the attemptsmade both recently and earlier, in different quarters, to relate separate servicesmore closely to each other and to &quot; rationalise &quot; the pattern here and there.There is no room to deal with all this. The general picture given is perhapsenough to reveal the essential features of the present situation.
THE PRESENT HEALTH SERVICES IN SCOTLAND.Genera].The health services in Scotland had the same origin and their development has followed much the same course as the health services in England and Wales.There has been the same evolution from the measures taken by public authorities at the beginning of last century to relieve the destitute sick, followed later in thecentury by the development of the environmental public health services and thetreatment of infectious diseases, to the expansion of the personal health services in the present century. There has been the same haphazard growth of these services through the years, leaving much the same gaps to be filled and the same kind of problems to be solved. This being so, a description of the history andthe present state of the health services in Scotland would inevitably repeat muchof what has already been said in this Appendix. But the development .of theservices in the two countries has not been uniform. Some of the Scottish servicesdiffer in their scope and organisation from the corresponding services in Englandand Wales; others, such as the Highlands and Islands Medical Service, have noEnglish counterpart at all. The following paragraphs draw attention to the mostimportant of these differences.Local Authorities.The Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1929, substantially reduced the numberof local authorities concerned with the health of the people. The health services(excluding for this purpose the environmental services general sanitation, watersupply, drainage and housing) are now administered by the 55 &quot; major health authorities,&quot; namely, the county councils, of which there are 31, and the towncouncils of large burghs, of which there are 24. A large burgh is one nominallywith a population of over 20,000. The school health service, however, is adminis-tered only by the county councils and the town councils of the four Cities (Edin-burgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee), which are education authorities.Hospital and Consultant Services.In broad outline, the development of the hospital services in Scotland has beensimilar to that in England and Wales. The two hospital systems voluntary andlocal authority have grown up side by side in much the same way in both countries. But the voluntary hospitals in Scotland still provide much the bigger part of the institutional service for the treatment of acute medical andsurgical conditions. Before the war there were some 220 voluntary hospitalswith a total of over 14,000 beds. On the other hand, local authorities have entered the &quot; general &quot; hospital field only in recent years and so far have providedonly some 5,500 beds in nine local authority general hospitals. With one smallexception, these hospitals are found in the four Cities. There are still about1,700 beds in public assistance institutions accommodating the &quot; chronic sick&quot;coming within the scope of the poor law.The tradition of the Scottish voluntary hospitals is to afford free treatment.There has been very litle development of the pay-bed system; and it is notcustomary to ask the patient in ordinary wards to make a paymenttowards the cost of his treatment. While there are organised schemes in offices,factories and work places, for collecting subscriptions for hospitals, little hasbeen done to organise voluntary contributory schemes of the type found inEngland and Wales. Local authorities which have provided hospitals for thegeneral sick apart from the poor law are obliged by statute to charge a reasonablesum towards the cost of the patient&apos;s treatment. But there is no power to charge for the hospital treatment of infectious disease. (Further reference is made belowto infectious diseases hospitals and sanatoria.)Between the wars, the re-organisation of the Scottish hospital services was widely discussed and a number of important committees reported on the subject.Considerable support has been given to the view that Scotland both requires andlends itself to a regional co-ordinated hospital service comprehending both the voluntary and local authority hospitals. This view takes account mainly ofthe fact that the country&apos;s key hospitals as well as the medical schools are all tobe found in the four Cities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, and that
these centres are natural focal points for a regional organisation. The conception of four hospital regions based on these Cities, with a fifth based for geographicalreasons on Inverness, has thus become the common currency of all discussions on Scottish hospital policy. The recently published report of the HetheringtonCommittee not only re-affirms this conception but makes definite proposals for setting up Regional Hospital Councils with primarily advisory functions.Scotland has for long suffered&apos; from an acute shortage of hospital accommoda-tion and the waiting list problem has been serious. This gives special importanceto the fact that the Emergency Hospital Service, organised originally for thetreatment of air-raid casualties, has added some 15,000 new beds to the country&apos;total hospital provision. Of these, 8,000 are in annexes at existing hospitals, and7,000 are in seven completely new hospitals. While these beds are in buildings of emergency construction and while their number will be materially reduced to conform to peace-time standards of bed-spacing and the like, they will form a welcome addition to the post-war hospital service. The annexes are administered by the hospital authorities responsible for the parent hospitals to which they are attached: the seven new hospitals are directly administered by the Department ofHealth for Scotland.Fortunately, little call has had to be made so far on the emergency hospitalorganisation for the treatment of air-raid casualties and beds have therefore beenfree, within the limits of the available nursing staff, for other purposes. Forexample, emergency beds have been used to great public advantage in relieving the waiting lists of the voluntary hospitals: up to the end of 1943, some 24,000patients had been admitted for treatment from these lists.The existence of staffed beds in the emergency hospitals under the Departmentsdirect control with full consultant and diagnostic facilities available has alsofacilitated an interesting and successful experiment in preventive medicine, in-volving the close co-operation of the family doctor, consultant and hospital services. This was originally known as the Clyde Basin Experiment which had its origin in reports received from various sources towards the end of 1941suggesting that war strain, long hours, and the black-out were affecting the health of the working population in Scotland, including that of young women who had entered industry for the first time. At the same time it was becoming clear thatthe man-power needs of the nation required the organisation of the civilianmedical services on lines which would secure that early and correct diagnosis and treatment were available for any condition which threatened to impair theworking capacity of war workers or to leave a war aftermath of chronic invalidism.Accordingly, early in 1942, the Secretary of State launched the experiment for thebenefit of young industrial workers between 18 and 25 years of age, in the west of Scotland. Family doctors in the area were asked to refer to the DepartmentsRegional Medical Officer patients in a debilitated state or showing symptoms sug-suggesting the need for expert diagnosis. The experiment was successful from the start and by the end of the year it was extended to cover war workers of all agesin the whole of the industrial belt. It is now known as the SupplementaryMedical Service Scheme. Under the scheme, the Regional Medical Officer, eitherhimself or with the aid of consultants, makes a thorough examination of every case referred to him; a full range of consultants is available for the purpose.Where necessary, the Regional Medical Officer arranges for the patienfs admission to hospital for observation and full clinical investigation or to a convalescenthospital if rest or &quot; building up &quot; is needed. Where on medical grounds a changeof work seems desirable the Regional Medical Officer consults the Ministry ofLabour and National Service. A full report is furnished to the family doctor inevery case for his future guidance and, in selected cases, follow-up work isundertaken.Up to the end of 1943, some 6,300 patients had been referred to the RegionalMedical Officers for examination. The scheme has shown what can be done in bringing the family doctor into close and effective contact with the consultantsand the hospitals contacts which have evoked the warmest appreciation fromdoctors and patients alike.Infectious Diseases Hospitals.As in England and Wales, it was not until the middle of the rrhieteerithcentury that organised   steps were first taken  to deal with infectious diseases.
Glasgow&apos;s first municipal fever hospital was opened in 1865. Two years later thePublic, Health (Scotland) Act, 1867, empowered local authorities for the first timeto make provision for the prevention and mitigation of epidemic, endemic orcontagious diseases. These powers included one to provide hospitals for the sick generally hut by the Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1897, this power was limited&apos;to the provision of hospitals for those suffering from infectious diseases.This Act of 1897, which is still the principal Public Health statute applicableto Scotland, is the basis of the present system of public health administration.It made compulsorily notifiable throughout Scotland the diseases which previouslyhad been notifiable only in the areas of local authorities which had adopted theInfectious Disease (Notification) Act, 1889, and it gave powers to the central department to require the notification of other diseases. Through the years the list of notifiable diseases has been considerably extended.Many local authoritis combined to discharge their duties under the Act of1897 with regard to the treatment of infectious diseases. The Local Government(Scotland) Act, 1929, in reducing the number of local authorities responsible forthis seivice to 55, consequentially reduced the number of hospital combinations.There are now 12 joint boards providing infectious diseases hospitals on behalf of23 of the authorities.. In all, there are 109 infectious diseases hospitals with about 7,600 beds, excluding beds for the treatment of tuberculosis. Sixty-six of the hospitals have less than 50 beds. The institutional treatment of infectious diseases in Scotland is entirely free.Tuberculosis.Responsibility for the treatment of tuberculosis&apos;io.-i.s in Scotkujd is included in thegeneral responsibility for treating infectious diseases laid by the public healthstatutes on the .55 major health authorities. There is no separate statutory provision dealing with tuberculosis us in England and Wales and in particularthere is no specific power to provide for the after-care of persons who have suffered from tuberculosis.The main features of the tuberculosis schemes derive from the efforts of thelate Sir Robert Philip who 111 1887 laid in Edinburgh the foundation of an anti-tuberculosis organisation based on the association of the dispensary, the sana-sanatorium and the farm colony. The higher techniques in the treatment of tuber-culosis have been greatly developed since these early days, but the basic principlesof this pioneering effort still hold good.Local authorities were at first slow to follow Sir Robert Philip&apos;s lead. One ortwo of them in 1904 experimented with the isolation of pulmonary tuberculosisin spare wards of infectious diseases hospitals, but it was not until 1906 that substantial progress began to be made. In that year the Local Government board for Scotland (at that time the central Department) made pulmonary tuberculosiscompulsorily notifiable and extended to this disease the statutory obligation which already rested on local authorities to deal with certain other infectious diseases.Before the war, there were about 5,300 tuberculosis beds in Scotland, of which about 4,700 were in local authority institutions. Although some of these bedswere converted to other uses when war broke out, alternative arrangements, in-eluding the provision of beds in the Department&apos;s emergency hospitals, have resulted in a net increase in the available bed accommodation.The incidence of tuberculosis is relatively higher in Scotland than in England andWcdes, and it has tended to increase in war-time. There are empty beds availablefor tuberculosis patients which cannot be used for lack of nurses. This has produced a lengthening waiting list of sufferers requiring institutional treatment,one of the distressing features of the present state of the public health.Venereal Disease.There are about 50 out-patient clinics and centres in Scotland for the treatmentof venereal disease. Some are in voluntary hospitals but many have been-speciallyprovided.Mental Health Services.Provision for the care and treatment of persons suffering from mental disorderis made by lecal authorities under the Lunacy l(Scotland) Acts, 1857 to 1919.
nWhile these Acts make some provision for voluntary patients, no specific powers have been conferred on local authorities with regard either to voluntary patientsor to out-patient diagnosis and treatment. There is indeed no counterpart inScotland to the English Mental Treatment Act of 1930. Nevertheless, this partof the service has developed steadily in recent years. In 1942, 14.2 per cent,of the admissions to mental hospitals provided by local authorities were voluntarypatients.There are 23 local authority mental hospitals in Scotland, of which 13 servecombinations of two or more authorities. The 23 hospitals had 12,800 patients on1st January, 1943. Four single authorities and two combinations have no mental hospitals of their own but depend on contracts made with the Royal mental hospitals (or Asylums).There are seven Royal (or Chartered) Mental Asylums which originated underendowment schemes and are the oldest of the existing institutions for the insanein Scotland.   On 1st January, 1943, they had 5,300 patients.Provision for the care of mental defectives is made under the Mental Deficiency(Scotland) Acts, 1913 and 1940. As in England, the war of 1914-18 checkeddevelopments under the 1913 Act, and institutional provision is still very in-adequate. On 1st January, 1943, there were 3,900 mental defectives in certifiedinstitutions and 1,750 under guardianship. Five of the 13 institutions aremanaged by joint boards or joint committees. One of the largest of the institu-tions and two small ones have been provided by organisations other than localauthorities.Central supervision of the lunacy and mental deficiency services is the respon-sibility of the General Board of Control for Scotland,&apos; the members of which are appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Secretary of State.The Committee on Scottish Health Services pointed out the need for the revision . and consolidation of the Scottish lunacy and mental deficiency laws,and this problem is. now being considered b3*- a Committee appointed for thepurpose under the chairmanship of Lord Russell. The former - Committee alsoemphasised that the outstanding need of the mental health service was for aco-ordinated movement to deal with early mental and nervous disorders. It isin this field that the service has been chiefly lacking.Maternity and Child Welfare.The local organisation of the maternity and child welfare service is the respon-sibility of the 55 major health authorities. There is no counterpart in scotland to the minor authorities of England and Wales.Local authorities had no statutory powers to undertake child welfare worktill 1915, when they were empowered by the Notification of Births (Extension)Act to attend to the health of expectant and nursing mothers and of children under five years of age. At the end of 1919 schemes for this purpose were inoperation in areas comprising 55 per cent, of the population: ten years later thepercentage had risen to 94: and since the passing of the Local Government(Scotland) Act, 1929, the remaining 6 per cent, of the population has been covered.The scope of the service is broadly similar in the two countries, resting as it doeson the employment of doctors, midwives, health visitors and specialists, and onthe apparatus of clinics, centres, nurseries, maternity hospitals and homes. Butthere is one noteworthy difference. The Maternity Services (Scotland) Act, 1937,created a domiciliary maternity service which differs from that in England andWales in that, while the English service is based on the midwife alone, the Scottishservice is based on the doctor-midwife combination. That is to say, under the act of 1937 it is now a duty on every local authority in Scotland to make available toall women, who are to be confined at home and who apply for the service, thejoint care throughout pregnancy, labour and the puerperium of a doctor and ofa certified midwife, with the advice and help, so far as it is practicable to provideit, of an expert obstetrician at any time if the doctor thinks this necessary.There are some 1,400 practising midwives in Scotland, including 90 whole-timeemployees of local authorities.31033e
While the maternal and infant mortality rates have shown a big improvementover the years, the position in Scotland is still much less favourable than that inEngland and Wales. The recently published Report of the Orf Committeeexamines the problem of infant mortality in Scotland and, among other things,calls attention to the poor liaison between the hospitals, the family doctor andthe child welfare service.Home Nursing.The Queen&apos;s Institute of District Nursing have 1,050 nurses operating in Scot-land. The District Nurse plays an important part in many areas as health visitorand tuberculosis nurse under the local authority schemes. She has a special im-porcance in the sparsely populated rural areas where clinic services are remote ornon-existent. Under the Maternity Services (Scotland) Act, 1937, many of theauthorities are dependent on the District Nurses for their midwife services. Inrespect of these various statutory services, the District Nursing Associations aresubsidised by the local authorities concerned.The Health of the School Child.The first step taken in this field was the appointment in 1902 of the RoyalCommission on Physical Training (Scotland) to inquire into the physical conditionof school children. The Commission found that data on the subject hardlyexisted, but that army recruiting returns showed a disquieting proportion of unfitapplicants for military service. After a medical examination of 1,200 children in Aberdeen and Edinburgh, the Commission recommended that school boards should undertake the medical inspection of school children and record the results.This finding was emphasised by the Interdepartmental Committee on PhysicalDeterioration in 1904. Four years later the Education (Scotland) Act, 1908,provided for the medical examination and supervision of all school children, and authorised school boards to employ doctors and nurses for the purpose.This was followed by the passing of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1913, whichempowered school boards to provide for the medical treatment of children ofnecessitous parents. More recently, the Education (Scotland) Act, 1942, in effectplaces a duty on education authorities to arrange for the medical treatment ofany school child who is unable, for the lack of treatment, to take full advantageof the education provided.As already&apos; indicated, the local authorities for school health administration axethe 31 county councils and the town councils of the four cities of Glasgow. Edin-burgh, Dundee and Aberdeen, which constitute the 35 education authorities ofScotland. Central responsibility rests &quot;With the Secretary of State who exerciseshis functions through the Department of Health for Scotland.The Highland and Islands (Medical Service) Scheme.The Highlands and Islands area is the only part of Scotland and for that matter the only part of the United Kingdom in which an attempt has been madeto organise a complete medical service available to all classes. The keystone oithis structure is the Highlands and Islands Medical Service, a unique effort inco-operation between the State and doctors in private general practice, which hasrevolutionised medical provision in the area. A Sub-Committee of the ScottishHealth Services Committee, reporting in 1936 on the suitability of the Service tothe peculiar conditions of the Highlands and Islands, suggested that it might evenprovide a model on which to build the future medical service in Scotland as awhole. Now that the time is come to consider this larger issue the Highlands and islands Medical Service is of special interest and worth examining.The Medical Service was set up following the investigation of the Dewar Com-mittee who reported in 1912 that on account of the sparseness of the population insome districts, its irregular distribution in others, the configuration of the countryand the climatic conditions, medical attendance was uncertain for the people,exceptionally onerous or even hazardous for the doctor and generally inadequate.The Committee also reported that the straitened circumstances of the people pre-cluded the adequate payment of doctors by fees alone. The result was thepassing of the Highlands and Islands (Medical Service) Grant Act, 1913, whichconstituted the Highlands and Islands Medical Service Fund, annually replenished
by Parliament, for the- purpose. of providing and improving means for the pre-vention, treatment and alleviation of illness and suffering in the area. The Fund.1S administered by the Department of Health for Scotland.The area covered by the operations of the Medical Service comprises the sevencounties of Argyll, Caithness, Inverness (excluding the burgh of Inverness), Rossand Cromarty, Sutherland, Orkney and Zetland, and the Highland District ofPerthshire. This area covers more than half the land surface &quot;of Scotland butcontains less than one-fifteenth of the total population.A single visit in the Highlands and Islands may involve a doctor in a journeyof many miles lasting some hours. Fees which would adequately recompense the doctor in these circumstances would be beyond the means of all but a few of thepopulation. The basis of the Medical Service, therefore, is that it should providemedical attendance to beneficiaries at uniform fees irrespective of the distancewhich the doctor may have to travel. This is secured by paying grants to the doctor to compensate him for his travelling and his time, in return for whichhe undertakes to attend to his patients at modified fees. This modified fee systemapplies to the families and dependants of insured persons, uninsured persons ofthe crofter and cottar classes, and others in like circumstances who could not otherwise pay for their medical attendance. These arrangements have led to an enormous increase in the number of visits paid to beneficiaries. Where the grant payable on the basis of mileage travelled would not provide the doctor with anadequate income, the payments out of the Fund are calculated with reference tothe net income of the practice so as to provide the doctor with a reasonableliving. This applies in 23 out of a total of 153 subsidised practices. The doctor&apos;income is, of course, not derived wholly from the Fund. But what is receivedfrom this source is usually a substantial supplement to his other sources of income_National Health Insurance capitation fees, payments from the County council for public appointments, and fees from private patients.The Medical Service is provided in consultation with the County Councils in thearea, but the contract takes the form of an agreement entered into directly betweenthe doctor and the Department. On &quot;a vacancy arising in a single-doctor area the County Council advertises for a local medical officer to undertake publicassistance, school inspection and tuberculosis work. The Department then con-sider whether they are prepared to enter into an agreement for Medical Servicework with the doctor whom the County Council propose to appoint. In areas with more than one doctor, the new doctor may receive no public appointment andthe Department conclude their agreement with him independently of the CountyCouncil. It is a condition of each agreement that the doctor uses a car for thepurposes of his practice.-The Department do not exercise any detailed control over the doctor&apos;s services:there is no interference whatever with his professional practice. Medical officers011 the Department&apos;s staff visit doctors in the area periodically to smooth outdifficulties and to keep the Department generally in contact with the administra-tion and development of the Service. This method of central administra-tion, free from restrictive conditions and anything resembling vexatious control,has proved an outstanding success: it has satisfied the departments reasonablerequirements and is acceptable to the doctors.Special arrangements are made to provide the doctors with holiday reliefs andwith opportunties for post-graduate study.   The Fund also assists in the building of doctors&apos; houses and in the improvement of existing houses.But the test of the Medical Service is primarily not what it does for the doctor-and it does much for him but what it does for the patient. The answer here is clear. The &quot; quite inadequate &quot; general medical service, described by theDewar Committee in 1912, is a thing of the past and in every district in the highlands and Islands the services of a doctor are available on reasonable terms.And the doctors which the Medical Service attracts are generally of a better typethan some that were to be found in the area before.A similar improvement has been effected in the nursing service.   This waslamentably deficient before 1912, partly because of the difficulties of travel in thearea, and partly because voluntary effort did hot suffice to maintain an adequate31032 E a
service. Liberal grants are therefore made out of the Fund to district nursingassociations towards the cost of employing district nurses, and providing themwith houses and motor cars and cycles. There are now over 200 nurses at workthroughout the area, nearly double the number working in 1914. Almost all are fully trained nurses, and all are certified midwives. .There have been developments beyond the primary essentials,&apos; medical and nursing. The Royal Infirmary, Inverness, has been largely rebuilt (the work being assisted by substantial grants from the Fund); and it now occupies a pre-eminent place in the hospital resources of the area. The Lewis Hospital atStornoway has likewise benefited and, with its latest extensions, is able td^ providea comprehensive service which obviates the transfer of many patients to mainlandhospitals. Arrangements have been made with other hospitals for the employ-ment of full-time qualified surgeons. Thus grants are paid towards the salaries of surgeons attached to hospitals at Lerwick, Kirkwall, Golspie, Fort Wilham,Wick and Thurso. Additional subsidised services include a medical consultantat Inverness, a dental service for the people of Skye and part of the Outer Isles, amassage service for Caithness and Sutherland, a special service for the treatmentof tuberculosis in Zetland, Lewis and South LTist, where the incidence of thisdisease is high, and an ambulance service. The air ambulance has now become a familiar feature of the service: patients, in urgent need of treatment, are flownto the Glasgow Infirmaries from islands lying off the west coast.The amount of grants paid out of the Highlands and Islands (Medical Service)Fund for the various services during the year ended 31st March, 1943, was just under ^100,000.APPENDIX B.EARLIER DISCUSSIONS OF IMPROVED HEALTH SERVICES AND AN outline of EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE PREPARATION OF THIS PAPER.It was recognised very shortly after the inception of medical benefit under theNational Health Insurance Scheme in 1913 that there was a strong case forsupplementing the general practitioner service with a consultant service. Prepara-tions for this were advanced at the outbreak of the 1914-18 war. The war put anend to further progress in the matter, but towards its end a series of discussionstook place between the National Health Insurance Commissioners and leading members of the medical profession on the general subject of the extension ofhealth services.Shortly after the establishment of the Ministry of Health in 1919, a consultative council on Medical and Allied Services was appointed by the Minister under thechairmanship of Lord Dawson of Perm. This body was invited to consider&apos;andreport on schemes &quot; requisite for the systematised provision of such forms of medical and allied services as should, in the opinion of the Council, be availablefor the inhabitants of a given areaSpace does not permit describing in detail the recommendations made in the valuable report of this body which was published in 1920, but the general con-ception which its authors had in mind was that of a comprehensive scheme underwhich all forms of medical service would be made available, under suitable con-ditions, to the population at large. The report recommended the establishmentof Health Authorities for local administration and it contemplated, as does thepresent Papjer, the co-ordination of municipal and voluntary agencies as thebasis of the scheme. It is worth noting that the Council justified their recom-mendations &quot; because the organisation of medicine has become insufficient and because it fails to bring the advantages of medical knowledge adequately within reach of the people &quot;.In the same year (1920) a Consultative&apos; Council on Medical and Allied Servicesappointed by the Scottish Board of Health under the chairmanship of Sir DonaldMacAlister reported on a somewhat similar remit. Their report urged that &quot; acomplete and adequate medical service should be brought within the reach ofevery member of the community.&quot; They made a number of recommendationsdesigned to ensure that the family doctor (on whom the organisation of thenation&apos;s health service should be based) would be provided with all supplementary
professional advice and assistance, and they proposed that the State insurancemedical service should be extended to cover persons of the same economic level as insured persons and dependants of insured persons. These and their other proposals provided a basis for much of the later discussion on the requirementsof a national health service.In 1921 there was issued the report of the Voluntary Hospitals committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Cave, which had been set up by the Minister ofHealth to consider the financial position of the voluntary hospitals. In, additionto recommending an exchequer grant to meet the immediate needs of the hospitals, the Committee proposed the establishment of permanent machinery to co-ordinate the work and the finances of voluntary hospitals throughout thecountry. This machinery was to consist of a central Voluntary Hospitals Com-mission and of local Voluntary Hospitals Committees for county and countyborough areas. The report of the Committee touched on many of the problems with which this Paper is concerned, though its scope was limited to recommenda-tions affecting voluntary hospitals. The Government accepted the findings ofthe Committee to the extent of providing an exchequer grant for the voluntary hospitals of  500,000 (not  1,000,000 as the Committee had suggested), but thelong-term proposals of the Committee for the establishment of co-ordinatingmachinery were not carried into effect.Sixteen years later the position of the voluntary hospitals was again reviewed by a body established under the chairmanship of Lord Sankey by the BritishHospitals Association, and known as the Voluntary Hospitals Commission. Thereport of this body, like that of its predecessor, proposed the establishment of central and local bodies with co-ordinating functions and recommended a systemof exchequer grants in aid of the voluntary hospitals.In 1936 the report of the Committee on Scottish Health Services (the CathcartReport) was published. The Committee reviewed the whole of Scotland&apos;s health services, personal and environmental, and made many important recommenda-tions within a national health policy for promoting the &quot; fitness &quot; of the people.The recommendations of the report assume throughout that the separate medical services must be integrated and that a co-ordinated medical service should bebased, as far as possible, on the family doctor. The report is too comprehensivein scope to lend itself to brief quotation, but it is one of the most completeofficial surveys of the country&apos;s health services and health problems yet attempted.The recommendations of the Committee have already formed the basis of legis-lation in particular fields.The latest official report on hospital problems is that recently issued by theCommittee which, under the chairmanship of Sir Hector Hetherington, wasappointed by the Secretary of State to advise on various post-war hospital prob-lems in Scotland. This report contains detailed recommendations for the settingup of five Regional Hospital Advisory Councils in Scotland. It also makesvarious suggestions for improved co-operation between hospitals and deals at length with financial arrangements as affecting the future voluntary hospitalsystem.Other helpful contributions to the study of hospital problems have been made from time to time by many other bodies, including the British Hospitals Associa-tion, the King Edward&apos;s Hospital Fund for London, the Contributory SchemesAssociation and most recently the Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust which hascombined theory with practice in its well-known enterprises in paving the way for greater local co-ordination in the hospital services.Throughout the period between the two wars, the British Medical Associationhave been active in focussing the mind of the medical profession upon constructive proposals for the extension and development of the existing health services. In1030, and again in 1938, they published, as supplements to the British Medicallournal, comprehensive . proposals for &quot; A General Medical Service for theNation &quot;, and in 1942 the Medical Planning Commission organised by the Associa-tion issued a draft Interim Report which offered for the consideration of the profession far-reaching suggestions for the improvement of the medical servicesof the community.   Salient passages from this important document are quoted
in the body of this Paper. Other publications in this field of which mentionshould be made are a report issued by a professional group known as MedicalPlanning Research and representing for the most part the younger elements inthe profession, a proposal for a National Health Service by the Society of medical -Officers of Health and a valuable and mainly factual report published by Political and Economic Planning (P.E.P.) in 1937. These publications, andmany others too numerous to be mentioned, have been supplemented by copiousdiscussion in the columns of the professional and the lay press.It is not possible, within the limits of this document, to review all this field of political and professional literature, but it may be said in very general terms that the principles most frequently recurring in the presentation of plans for future developments are the following:  (1) that there should be made available to every individual in the communitywhatever type of medical care and treatment he may need;(2) that the scheme of services should be a fully integrated scheme and thatin particular a much closer linking up between general practitioner services onthe one hand and consultant and hospital services on the other ought to beachieved; and(3) that for certain services, particularly the hospital service, larger areas oflocal administration are needed than those of any existing kind of localauthorities.It is against this background of constructive thinking and discussion during thelast quarter of a century that the proposals in the present Paper have beenprepared and1 are put forward.The Government announced in October, 1941 their intention to ensure, bymeans of a comprehensive hospital service, that appropriate hospital treatmentshould in future be readily available to everyone in need of it. The declaredbasis for this was to be a new duty upon major local authorities, in close co-opera-tion with voluntary agencies working in the same field, to see that a full hospital service, of every necessary kind, was made universally available; it was expresslyrecognised that this would mean designing the service over areas larger than thoseof most of the existing local authorities and that the full use of the powerfulresources of the voluntary hospitals, while putting their relations with the localauthorities on a more regular footing, would be of the essence of the scheme. Topave the way a detailed and expert survey was started on the Minister of Health&apos;?behalf partly conducted directly by the Ministry and partly organised for theMinister by the NufBeld Provincial Hospitals Trust of the hospital servicesalready available in each area in England and Wales. This survey is nownearing its completion. So also is a similar survey in Scotland, instituted by the Secretary of State.Then, more recently, the report of Sir William Beveridge having taken as oneof the bases of its proposals the assumption that a comprehensive national health service, for all purposes and for all people, would be established, the government announced in February, rg43, that they also accepted this assumption.The Health Ministers thereupon approached the medical profession, the volun-tary hospitals and the major local government authorities, from each of whom they wanted on a proposal of this magnitude-to obtain all possible help andexpert guidance from the outset. It was arranged with them that, for the first stage, they should appoint small groups of representatives of their own choiceand that these groups should take part in general preliminary discussions.The programme was that there would need to be three stages in the evolution of the Governments proposals.There would be a first stage, in which a preliminary exchange of ideas wouldbe conducted informally and confidentially and without commitment on either side to enable the Ministers to get a general impression of the feeling of theserepresentatives on some of the main issues involved and to help them to clear theground.This second stage would be one of public discussion in Parliament and else-where.    It would be the stage at which everybody the public generally, for
whom the service would be designed, the doctors and the hospitals and thelocal authorities and other organisations which would be concerned in it oraffected by it, and those men and women (including doctors) who are now engaged in the Armed Forces would be able to discuss what was proposed andto voice their opinions about it. To assist in this the Government would issue a white Paper which would serve as a focus for detailed discussion.The third stage would then be one in which the Government would settlewhat exact proposals they would submit in legislative form for the decision ofParliament.For the first stage the representative groups were duly formed. In Englandand Wales, for the medical profession the British Medical Association, in collabora-tion with the Royal Colleges, brought together a representative group of medicalmen and women. For the voluntary hospitals representatives of the BritishHospitals Association and the King Edward&apos;s Hospital Fund for London, withrepresentatives of the Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust joining as observers,together formed a group. For the major local government authorities the CountyCouncils Association, the Association of Municipal Corporations and the LondonCounty Council combined to form the third group.Separate arrangements were made by the Secretary of State for Scotland for discussions with representatives of the medical profession in Scotland, the scottish local authority associations and the Scottish Branch of the British HospitalsAssociation. These separate discussions took account of Scottish experience andof geographical, administrative and other differences.Discussions took place with each group on those aspects of a comprehensiveservice which most affected.4hem. For the purpose of discussion the Ministersoffered to each group in memoranda and orally a series of suggestions andideas for them to consider. They made it clear throughout that they welcomedcriticism and alternative suggestions and were not at any stage confronting anyof the groups with a predetermined scheme. They received suggestions fromthe groups on many of the subjects involved, and discussion from the outset wason the frankest basis. Inevitably there was divergence of opinion on some ofthe issues involved, which each group approached from a different background of experience and opinion, but the discussions were useful as a preliminary soundingof the expert view.The present White Paper does not purport to sum up the discussions whichhave taken place, or to reflect any agreement or represent any views reached in these discussions. That would be inconsistent with the terms on which thediscussion were undertaken.APPENDIX C.possible methods of securing local administration over largerareas than those of present local government.On the assumption that for certain aspects of the health service, particularly the hospital service, there is need for larger areas of local administration thanexist for these purposes now, and that the body responsible for the administrationmust be representative of and answerable to the electors of the area, there are,broadly speaking, three possible courses:  -(i) to establish a directly elected body for the sole purpose of administer-ing these parts of the health service;(2) to establish a directly elected body for the purpose of administering a group of services including these parts of the health service;(3) to secure joint action by the councils of the existing counties and county boroughs which make up the proposed area of administration.The creation of a directly elected local authority for some particular purpose would run counter to modern developments in local government, which havebeen towards replacing the system of special authorities for the administration ofparticular services (such as Boards of Guardians and School Boards) by thesystem of authorities covering a wide range of functions.   But, apart from that
yethe process of electing a one-purpose authority operating over a fairly large area is not likely to arouse sufficient public interest to attract an adequate proportionof local voters to the poll. Moreover, the system if generalised over all thesocial services locally administered would create an impossible complexity of separate authorities for separate local administrative functions, each requiringseparate local election, each operating over a different area, and each requiringseparate arrangements for rating or precepting in order to obtain its local revenue.An alternative suggestion, of establishing new local authorities over widerareas for a substantial group of local services, has been canvassed in recentyears. For instance, a proposal for comprising in a single local administrativearea the county of Northumberland, part of the county of Durham, and fourcounty boroughs lying on either side of the Tyne, was made in the majority report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in the Tyneside Area(1937) and it was recommended that six of the major local government services Public Health (Medical and Allied Services), Education, Public Assistance,Police, Fire Brigades, and Highways should be administered by a body withjurisdiction over the whole of this area. Proposals of a similar kind have beenmade in various quarters since the outbreak of the present war.An authority performing so many important functions would need to be directly elected. But its establishment would involve a major alteration of the structure of local government. It would deprive county councils of practically all their chief functions if, indeed, the few minor functions left could be held tojustify their continued existence at all; and it would so denude county borough councils of their powers as to leave them with functions in some respects less thanthose of the &quot; minor authorities &quot; of to-day. Recent publications of the various local government associations and other bodies have shown that there is a widedivergence of view as to the future pattern of local government. It is clear thatthis must be the subject of a comprehensive inquiry, which could not be insti-tuted under present conditions or completed in a short time. Settlement of themachinery of the new health service cannot await the conclusions of such an inquiry and the passing of any consequent legislation.The only practical course pending a general review of local government is touse the present machinery and the existing facilities for securing such com-binations of authorities as may be necessary. This means the application (andpossibly some adaptation) of the well-established practice of securing largeradministrative units by joint action.The advantages and disadvantages of administering particular services bycombinations of local authorities organised as joint boards have often been argued.The members of the Tyneside Commission, referred to above, differed on thepoint, the majority regarding the joint board system as &quot; undemocratic &quot;, the signatory of the minority report taking the opposite view and recommending theextension of the system as going a considerable way to meet the problems withwhich that area was faced. The general convenience of arrangements which make it possible to have an area of administration exactly appropriate to anyparticular service, and to set up an authority for that area, chosen by personswho are themselves direct representatives of the local electorate, cannot be denied. But it is true that the system, if completely generalised, would leavethe constituent local authorities who choose the members of the boards with little to do beyond nominating those members, instead of administering servicesthemselves.Other objections are often advanced. It is said that joint boards tend to attract the more elderly and less effective members of the constituent councils, and thattheir efficiency is thereby diminished. This is a matter of impression. It maybe that, even if it is true, it is due not to the nature of joint boards but to thesubject matters with which they happen to deal. A joint board administering(say) an infectious diseases hospital or a sewage disposal system although its activities may be not less essential to the public welfare may well attract lessinterest than would be taken in housing or education, two subjects which excite-the keenest interest among local administrators. In any case, this particularweakness of the joint board.system, if it exists, is one for which the remedy lies in the hands of local authorities themselves.
Another common criticism is that the powerful weapon of precepting onconstituent authorities for funds weakens ,a joint board&apos;s sense of financial responsibility; or to put it another way that the members of a joint board,being indirectly elected and therefore at two removes from the ratepayers, havenot the same need to justify policy to their supporters as the members of adirectly elected authority. There may be something in this, but it is a point which could be met, e.g., by requiring the joint authority to submit to its constituent councils (at intervals of, say, one or two or three years) estimates of their proposed expenditure, for the approval of all or of a specific majority of those councils. Some means of removing deadlocks (probably by way ofarbitral powers vested in the appropriate Minister) would be needed, unless amajority decision were to be binding. This device, coupled with a more regularhabit among the constituent councils of examining, and if necessary debating, theannual and other reports of the joint board, would go a long way to preservea proper relation of the board to its constituent councils and the electors.It is also said that the joint board system is bad in that it separates theservices entrusted to it from the rest of the main machinery of local government.So far as the health service is concerned, the answer is the practical one thatthe need to settle areas of proper size and resources for certain aspects of theservice is urgent, and that (temporarily at least) the joint board seems to be theonly practicable means of doing this. There need be no question of ruling out any wider development of local government which may later emerge, as the needfor new services and extensions of existing services reveals itself. But that is amatter of long-term policy, for which the establishment of a comprehensivehealth service cannot be delayed.APPENDIX   D.REMUNERATION OF GENERAL PRACTITIONERS.The National Insurance Act of 1911 did not itself lay down any method bywhich the doctors taking part in the service were to be remunerated, nor did it fix the amount of the remuneration. The former has from the outset been prescribed by regulation, the latter negotiated between the Government and the professionor on some occasions determined by arbitration. For the former, the medical benefit Regulations have from the start envisaged two systems one by way of acapitation fee for each person for whom the doctor had accepted responsibility,and the other by way of fees for services actually rendered. Provision is madefor combinations and variants of these two systems, but with certain minor excep-tions the capitation fee quickly became universal, chiefly owing to the difficultyof checking over-attendance under the other system.So long as payments for insurance work remained a part only and in manycases not the major part of a doctoris professional income, it was difficult to find any rational criterion on which to arrive at an appropriate capitation fee otherthan by reference to previous fees i.e., by the limited method of deciding whether any events occurring since the previous fee was fixed were such as to justify itsfurther alteration. It is well known that the original sum fixed in 1912 had regard to the practice of Friendly Societies and Medical Clubs, and that allsubsequent sums have been built up from that basis. But it must be expectedthat in future the bulk of general practitioners will look to the new service forthe whole, or substantially the whole, of their professional earnings. Hence,whatever methods of payment are adopted whether by capitation fees, by salary,or in some other way the substantial question at issue must be seen in a newlight. It must be seen as the question of what is on ordinary professionalstandards a reasonable and proper remuneration for the whole-time servicesof a general practitioner working in a public service. Whether this shouldbe worked out in terms of gross or net earnings, whether superannuation rightsare to be assumed and taken into account, what adjustments are to bemade for part-time work, are matters of comparative detail. When once themain figures have been satisfactorily settled, not only remuneration by capitationfee but remuneration under the salaried or part-salaried systems could be easilydetermined.
As the &quot;White Paper makes clear, the Government do not contemplate theintroduction of a universal salaried system, but they propose that doctors taking part in the public service should be remunerated on a basis of salaries or the equivalent in any part ot the service in which this form of payment is necessaryto efficiency. They contemplate also that it may be possible in certain other cases to offer remuneration by salary where the individual doctors concerned would prefer such an arrangement. In any event, whether payment is on asalaried or part-salaried system or on a basis of capitation fees, two principleswill have to be observed in the arrangements made. First, the doctors taking part in the scheme must be assured of an adequate and appropriate income.Second, the aim must be to achieve a system flexible enough to allow for propervariations attributable to extra qualifications and extra energy and interest, aswell as representing the reasonable and normal expectations of general practiceat all its stages.The Government fully recognise the importance, and the urgency from a pro-fessional point of view, of reaching an understanding on these crucial matters,and they will be ready to discuss them in detail with the profession^ representatives.APPENDIX E.FINANCE OF the NEW SERVICE.ENGLAND AND WALES.Financial questions were included in the discussions held with the interested bodies before the present White Paper was issued, and are referred to in variousplaces in the Paper. This Appendix sets out the general lines on which theGovernment think that a reasonable financial basis could be found for the scheme outlined in the Paper, and covers the suggested financial responsibility of themain agencies involved. This basis is suggested as being appropriate to the early years of the scheme. When once the service is well established some, simplerbasis unrelated to the expenditure of individual authorities may be considered.Further it will be appreciated that any estimates of cost made at the moment canonly be conjectural, and it will not be possible to make better estimates untilthe new scheme is nearing its final shape, and the necessary discussions and negotiations with the interested parties have made progress.Responsibilities of Local Authorities.The scheme outlined in the White Paper contemplates that a new joint authority will be responsible for the hospital and consultant services. The newauthority will also have the duty of preparing and submitting to the Minister a plan for the whole health service of its area and it is proposed that this plan,taking all the local circumstances into account, should determine precisely howresponsibility for the remaining services should be allocated. It is proposed,however, that child welfare responsibilities should always be entrusted to theauthority which is also the local education authority, the precise arrangements to be made being governed by the provisions of the current Education Bill asfinally approved by Parliament. The intention as regards other local services is that those which are essentially consultant services and thus closely linked with hospital administration should be the responsibility of the new joint autho-rities, and those which belong more to the sphere of general health care shouldbe the responsibility of county and county borough councils.The principal new health services which will have to be set up if the white paper scheme is adopted are home nursing, the provision of Health Centres andnew dental and ophthalmic services. In the case of these new services, as in thecase of existing services, there will be need for flexibility and it is contemplated that the final allocation of responsibility will be a matter for the area plan.It is assumed, however, that ordinarily responsibility for the provision of health centres and for the home nursing service will be assigned to county and countyborough councils. But no assumption can be made regarding the other two services. The shape of the new dental and ophthalmic services cannot be foreseenuntil the report of the Teviot Committee on the former has been received and
There was no direct exchequer grant in aid of this expenditure, but there wasindirect assistance to the rate-payers through the operation of the block grant to local authorities under the Local Government Act, 1929.After the war the 1938-39 Cost will be considerably increased. There will be some expansion of accommodation and services provided (e.g.. for cancer), prices in general will be higher, and nurses&apos; salaries have been increased substantially.In addition the joint authority will be put to expense in connection with thearrangements to be made with voluntary hospitals, and in providing for theconsultant service based on their own and on the voluntary hospitals. In thesecircumstances the cost to the joint&apos; authorities of these services in the years immediately after the war and of their general administrative costs may approach/70 millions.As regards the existing services, although there is no direct exchequer grant at present (except for cancer treatment, on which only a small amount was spent before or during the war by local authorities), the Government think thatthere should be a grant based on the number of hospital beds provided under thescheme.   This grant would be substantial and would help to meet the cost of* The term mental hospital is used in this appendix to include also mental deficiencyinstitutions.discussions on both have taken place with the interests concerned. It is conse-quently impossible to say at this stage whether the whole or a part of thesetwo services will be administered by local authorities or, if so, which authoritiesshould be made responsible for them.For the purpose of framing an estimate of the cost of the new health service as a whole however, it is immaterial to know precisely how responsibility for different parts of the service will be allocated among the various local authorities or to a central organisation. The hypothesis on which the figures given beloware based must not therefore be read to imply that decisions have been taken onany questions of allocation of responsibility which are left open in the white paper. The hypothesis selected as convenient for presenting the figures is thatthe new joint authorities will be responsible for the hospital and consultant service,tuberculosis dispensaries and mental clinics, and the county and county borough councils will be responsible for the provision of Health Centres and for the otherexisting local services, for the new home nursing services and, if the new dentaland ophthalmic services are, in fact, entrusted wholly to local authorities, forthese two services as well.The New Joint Authority.The scheme outlined in the White Paper contemplates that the new joint authority will take over all hospitals at present provided by rate-payers, in-cluding infectious diseases hospitals and mental hospitals* and will make arrange-ments with voluntary hospitals for the treatment of patients. They will also take over any tuberculosis dispensaries and mental clinics. Suitable financialadjustments will be made between the joint authority and the local authoritiesin respect of capital assets and liabilities taken over. A new service for which thejoint authorities will be responsible is the provision of consultants (based onhospitals). In addition, they will need administrative and technical staff in theexercise of their duty of co-ordinating all the health activities of their area.The total annual expenditure of all the new joint authorities will be veryconsiderable. For example, in 1938-39 the cost to the existing local authorities of the services to be transferred was:    millions.Mental Hospitals............      ............   12.3Infectious Diseases Hospitals  ...      ...       ...       ...      ...    ....     4.other Hospitals and Institutions       ...       ...      ...      ...      ...   14.fiTuberculosis Services      ...       ...      ...       ...      ...      ...      ...     4.635-7
providing the consultant service based on hospitals. The grant for cancertreatment would be discontinued, as would the temporary war-time grant inrespect of increases in the salaries of nurses, midwives, etc. In the case of theother new services they propose a 50 per cent, grant.For the purposes of this Appendix the grant per bed has been taken as  100per annum in the case of all hospitals other than mental hospitals and infectiousdisease hospitals and  35 per annum in the case of mental and infectious diseasehospitals. A lower grant in the case of beds in these latter hospitals is justifiednot only on the ground of comparative cost of treatment and maintenance, but because the new scheme broadly does not impose any additional duties on localauthorities in respect of treatment. The number of mental hospital beds has beentaken as 170,000, of infectious disease hospitals as 40,000 and of other municipalhospital beds as 210,000.On the above assumptions, the new joint authorities would spend about 70 millions a year. They would receive direct exchequer grants of  6 millions in respect of mental hospitals,  1.4 . millions in respect of infectious diseasehospitals and  21 millions in respect of other hospitals, a total of  28.4 millions.The balance of cost^-on these assumptions  41.6 millions would be raised bymeans of precept on the constituent counties and county boroughs in the areaof the joint authority, who would levy a rate for it. The rate-payers would accordingly have to find this  41.6 millions as against the  35.7 millions theyhad to find in 1938-39. The Government propose that this increased rate demandshould be mitigated by an exchequer grant, as explained in the paragraphswhich follow dealing with counties and county boroughs.Counties and County Boroughs.As already indicated, this financial memorandum is based on the hypothesis that county and county borough councils will remain responsible for clinicservices other than tuberculosis dispensaries and mental clinics, the major onesbeing maternity and child welfare and venereal disease, and will continue to bethe responsible authority under the Midwives Act. In addition, it is assumed that they will provide and maintain Health Centres and will administer thehome nursing service.Taking figures of cost for 1938-39, the total expenditure on the servicesproposed to be transferred to the new joint authority was  35.7 millions andthat on the remaining services was  4.6 millions. Included in this latter figure was the balance of expenditure under the Midwives Act, after taking accountof a grant of  .6 million.The cost of these services will be greater after the war, owing to increased prices generally, to the cessation of fees charged for the attendance of midwivesand the increased salaries of midwives and to any necessary expansions. It isproposed that there should continue to be a 50 per cent, grant towards thecost of the midwives service, and with the increased cost the grant may wellamount to  1.5 million a year.In the early years after the war  1 million per annum may be spent on home nursing, though it is difficult to forecast the cost of this service. TheGovernment contemplate a 50 per cent, grant.The cost of the provision and maintenance of Health Centres is difficult to forecast at the moment. Excluding the remuneration of doctors in the Centresthe running costs (loan charges, heating, staff, etc.) of the Centres establishedduring the first year or two would probably not exceed  i million a year.The Government propose a 50 per cent, grant for this new service.It will take some time to establish the new dental and ophthalmic services, andit will probably be several years before the net expenditure - on- the servicesreaches  10 millions on the former and  1 million on the latter. The government propose a 50 per cent, grant towards these new services if responsibility for them is placed on counties and county borough councils. :Taking these figures, the total direct expenditure of counties and county boroughs on health services might amount to about  22 millions&apos;, towards which
there would be a direct exchequer grant of  8 millions. (Indirect assistance3 of course, also given by the Block Grant under the Local Government Act,i929-)The total amounts falling on the rate-payers would be  41.6 millions underprecept from the joint authorities and  14 millions direct expenditure, a totalof  55-6 millions. This compares with the figure for these services in 1938-39of /40-3 millions. The Government would propose that any increased ratedemand of this sort should be mitigated- by an exchequer grant amounting in total to about 50 per cent, of the increase in any year over the demand in someaxed year taken as standard. If 1938-39 were the standard year-, then on thefigures given the grant in aid of rates would be about  7.6 millions. The grant would be paid to each county or county borough as a proportion of its increased rate-burden, the proportion being higher for poor areas than for rich, on generalblock grant principles.Voluntary Hospitals.Before the war there were no exchequer grants to voluntary hospitals inrespect of their expenditure on the treatment and maintenance of patients. their income was derived as to about half from payments by patients, either direct or through contributory schemes, and as to the rest mainly from voluntary giftsand legacies and income from investments. During the war they have receivedpayments from the exchequer for work done in connection with the EmergencyHospital Scheme and are at present receiving an exchequer grant towards thecost of increased nurses&apos; salaries based on 50 per cent, of the additional costthey incur on that head.The: White Paper explains, the part which if is suggested that the voluntary hospitals should play iu. the new health scheme. Each voluntary hospital which makes arrangements with the new joint authority for the maintenance and treatment of patients under the, general conditions of the scheme will have partof the cost, paid to them, by the authority. This may take the form of a standard sum per occupied bed per week, varying only with the type of hospitalconcerned. ...I11 addition, in connection with the arrangements of the joint authority for theprovision of consultants agreed sums may be contributed in aid of salaries, etc.The war-time grant in respect of increases in salaries of nurses, midwives, etc.,will cease, but the Government propose a new grant in respect of each bed in a voluntary hospital which, under arrangements made with the joint authority, is used or kept available for patients in the scheme. Outside the arrangements of thescheme, a voluntary hospital will, of course, be free to provide such &quot; privatepay-beds &quot; as it thinks fit. Assuming that this grant will be the same as wastaken for beds in municipal hospitals, i.e.,  100 per annum, and that the totalnumber of beds included in arrangements with joint authorities may possiblyamount to 100,000, the exchequer grant would amount to  10 millions. this sum, together with the payments by joint authorities towards the cost of main-tenance and treatment of patients, would not cover the whole cost to the voluntary hospitals, which would still be dependent on voluntary resources for asubstantial part of the income necessary to balance their expenditure.The General Practitioner Service.   &apos;        .It is clearly not possible at present to &quot;give any but the roughest estimates ofthe probable cost of the general practitioner service under the new scheme. In1938, in respect of 17,800,000 insured persons under the National Health Insur-ance scheme, 17,164-general practitioners as a whole received  8.4 millions, while in the&apos; same year  2.4-millions was paid to chemists for fees and drugs in dis-pensing prescriptions.    ! &apos;For the purposes of this Appendix it is assumed that the cost of the extendedservice would amount to:  36 millions a year for doctors and chemists together.No account is taken of the cost of any superannuation scheme which may beintroduced or of the cost of compensation in those cases where it is applicable.
Total Annual Cost of the Scheme.On the basis of the rough estimates given in the preceding paragraphs thefollowing table shows the total annual cost of the scheme to public funds andthe proportions in which that cost might be borne by the ratepayers and by central funds.Service.

The Beveridge Report proposed that a sum of ^40 millions per annum should be available for the new healthTservices. Of this  35-7 millions would be the share appropriate to England and Wales, and if this assistance is assumed the proportions in which the total cost of the new service would fall onthe social insurance scheme, the taxpayer and the ratepayer would be, on theforegoing estimates and ignoring the effect of the block grant under the LocalGovernment Act, 1929 :  Social Insurance Scheme  35 -7 millions, or about 27    per cent.Taxpayer 48-3 ,,       36-6Ratepayer 48 ,, 36-4    ,, 132. -oAgain ignoring the effect of the block grant, the . corresponding table for theincomplete services of 1938-39 would be approximately:  Contribution under N.H.I.

With one material exception,however, the financial arrangements will be on broadly similar lines in the twocountries. That exception concerns the provision, equipment and maintenanceof Health Centres, which in England and Wales is likely to be a local responsi-bility and in Scotland the responsibility of the central authority. This being so,the whole cost of establishing these Centres in Scotland will be met from theexchequer, and the precise adjustments to be made in the grants payable to localauthorities under the new scheme to take account of this difference will be amatter for discussion with these authorities.
On the basis of the best information available to the Department of Healthlor Scotland, the following table gives a rough estimate of the total annual cost of the scheme in Scotland and its approximate allocation between the rate-pavers and central funds.Service.

SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS
IVOTE : The proposals of the Government are set out more fully, with the reasons for them,in the White Paper&quot; of which this present paper is an abridged version. Every effort hasbeen made to avoid discrepancies of terms or substance between this and the main white paper. Ify however, any uncertainty arises, it is to the main White Paper that the readermust look for explanation.* (Grid. 6502.   Price Is. od.)3INTRODUCTORYThe Government have announced that they intend to establish aNational Health Service, which will provide for everyone, without charge, all the medical advice, treatment and care they may require.This new service represents the natural next development in thelong and continuous growth of this country&apos;s health services.Although it forms part of the wider theme of post-war reconstruction,it has to be seen in the light of the past as well as the future and it stands on its own merits as part of a steady historical process of improving health and the opportunity for health among the people.Such a service was recommended in the Beveridge Report; the beveridge Report summed up its purpose quite shortly as a service which will ensure for every citizen whatever medical treatment herequires in whatever form he requires it, at home or in hospital, general,specialist or consultant, and will ensure also the provision of dental,ophthalmic and surgical appliances, nursing and midwifery, and rehabilitation after accidents. That is what the Government propose.For reasons of geography and local government structure there arecertain differences, principally in matters of administration, in thearrangements proposed for Scotland. These differences are explained in a section on the Service in Scodand and elsewhere in the text;where no difference is mentioned it should be understood that theproposals for England and Wales apply equally to Scotland with thenecessary adaptations.In considering the form which the new National Health service should take, the Government have had the help of informal discussions(in no way binding on those who took part in them) with representativesof the major Local Authorities, the Medical Profession, the voluntary hospitals and others. They now put forward definite proposals fordiscussion in Parliament and in the country, but they do not at thisstage put the proposals forward as fixed decisions. Indeed, theyhave promised that those concerned, professionally and otherwise,shall be fully consulted before final decisions are taken. The Govern-ment will welcome constructive criticism and they hope that the next stage of consultation and public discussion will enable them to submitquickly to Parliament legislative proposals w hich will be largely agreed
SCOPE OF A NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICEWhat the new service must offer the new service is designed to provide, for everyone who wishes to use it, a full range of personal health care. No-one, of course, willbe compelled to use it. Those who prefer and are able to make theirown arrangements for medical attention must be free to do so, andthe scheme must have sufficient flexibility to permit this. But to all who use the service it must offer, as and when required, the care of a family doctor, the expert skill of a consultant, laboratoryservices, treatment in hospital, the advice and treatment available inspecialised clinics (maternity and child welfare centres, tuberculosisdispensaries and the like), dental and ophthalmic treatment, drugs ardsurgical appliances, home nursing and all other services essential to health. Moreover, all these branches of medical care must be soplanned and related to one another that everyone who uses the new service is assured of ready access to whichever of its branches he orshe needs.Deficiencies in the existing services a very great deal of what is required is already provided in one orother of the existing health services. The problem of creating aNational Health. Service is not that of destroying services that areobsolete and bad and starting afresh, but of building on foundationslaid by much hard work over many years and making better what isalready good.Yet there are many gaps and deficiencies in the existing health services and much expansion and reorganisation are necessary to weldthem into a comprehensive National Service. Despite the progress made it would be far from true to say that everyone can get all the kinds of medical service which he requires. Nor is the care of healthyet wholly divorced from ability to pay for it. To take one very important example, the first of all requirements is a personal or family doctor, a general practitioner available for consultation on all problemsof health or sickness. At present the National Health Insurancescheme makes this provision for a large number of people, but not for wives or children or dependants and it does not normally afford the consultant and specialist services which the general practitionerneeds behind him. For extreme need, the older Poor Law still exists.For some particular groups, there are other facilities. But for something like half the population, the first-line health service of a personal medical adviser depends on private arrangements.So, too, in the hospital services, despite the well-known achieve-ments of the voluntary hospital movement, and more recently of thepublicly-provided hospitals of the local authorities, it is not yet true to say that everyone can be sure of the right hospital and specialistfacilities which he needs, when he needs them.Again,  many existing services  are provided-and excellently
provided by local authorities. But these services have grown uppiecemeal to meet different needs at different times, and so they are usually conducted as separate and independent services. There isno sufficient link either between these services themselves or betweendiem and general medical practice and the hospitals.Need for a new attitudePerhaps the most important point of all is the need for a newattitude towards health care. Personal health still tends to be regardedas something to be treated when at fault, or perhaps to be preservedfrom getting at fault, but seldom as sometlving to be positively improved and promoted and made full and robust. Much of present customand habit still centres on the idea that the doctor and the hospital andthe clinic are the means of mending ill-health rather than of increasinggood health and the sense of well-being. While the health standards of the people have enormously improved, and while there are gratifyingreductions in the ravages of preventable disease, the plain fact remainsthat there are many men and women and children who could beenjoying a sense of health and physical efficiency which they do notin fact enjoy; there is much sub-normal health still, which neednot be, with a corresponding cost in efficiency and personal happiness.Closing the gapsThe Government^ proposals for closing the gaps in the existing services and building a comprehensive National Service are described in the paragraphs which follow. For convenience, they are dividedinto four main sections dealing with General Medical Practice,Hospitals, Consultants, and Clinics and other Services. Short sectionsare added on Administration, on the Service in Scotland, and onFinance. Some of the proposals (e.g., a full dental or ophthalmicservice) will take time to develop; the full national service cannot be built in a day. But the important thing is to make sure that the designis sound. Some of the proposals are controversial that is inevitable.The Government hope, however, that their proposals, modifiedwhere modifications can be shown to be improvements, will win theapproval of all those who will look to the new scheme for the promotion of their health, and the goodwill of those on whose willing service its success will depend.IIGENERAL MEDICAL PRACTICEPrinciples of a General Practitioner service the arrangements for general medical practice are the most important part of the proposals for a National Health Service. The family doctoris the first line of defence in the fight for good health ; it is to him dratevery citizen using the new service will look for advice on his ownhealth and the health of his family; and it is generally through him that access will be had to the many other forms of medical care which
the National Service will provide. If there is to be that high degreeof confidence between doctor and patient on which the success of thenew scheme will depend, two principles must be observed.First, everyone must be free to choose the doctor whom he consults.Absolute freedom of choice is, of course, impracticable and does not exist now; the number of doctors in any one neighbourhood is necessarily limited. But there must be freedom to choose from amongthe doctors available.Second, there must be no such regimentation in the scheme as will prevent a doctor from exercising his professional skill in whateverway he believes to be in the best interests of his patient. Yet, if theState is to provide a universal service of family doctors^ there mustbe some degree of State intervention. In particular, the distributionof doctors must be sufficiently controlled to ensure that there iseverywhere an adequate service. The Government believe that their proposals preserve the right degree of balance in this.Developments in medical practiceAnother important point is the need to give free range to modernideas as to the best form of general medical practice. To this problemmuch thought has been given in recent years, particularly by the profession itself. The idea of grouped practice of individual doctorscollaborating with each other in teams in which &quot; many heads are better than one &quot; has received great prominence in professional andother discussions of late. The draft Interim Report of the MedicalPlanning Commission (organised by the British Medical Association)summarises the problem as follows : &quot; Diverse as are the views on the organization of medical services,there is general agreement that co-operation amongst individualgeneral practitioners in a locality is essential to efficient practiceunder modern conditions, though views vary on the form of theco-operation.   The principle of the organization of general practice on a group or co-operative basis is widely approved.&quot;The Government fully agree that &quot; grouped &quot; practices, to whichnumerous privately arranged partnerships point the way, must beplaced in the forefront of their plans for the National Health Service andtheir proposals are designed with this in view.   But the conception of grouped practices cannot represent the whole shape of the futureservice.  In the first place, there has not yet been enough experienceof the idea translated into fact.  Not enough has been found out, bytrial and error, to determine the conditions under which individualdoctors can best collaborate or the extent to which in the long run the public will prefer the group system.   Secondly, it is certain thatthe system could not be adopted everywhere simultaneously.  Thechange, even if experience shows that it should be complete, willtake time.The Government propose, therefore, that the new service shallbe based on a combination of grouped practice and of separate practice,side by side. Grouped practices are more likely to be found suitablein densely populated and highly built-up areas and it is there particularly
1(though not exclusively) that they will first be started. It will thenbe possible to watch the development, with the medical profession,and to decide in the light of experience how far and how fast a changeover to this new form of practice should be made.Grouped practice and Health CentresThe conception of grouped practice finds its most usual expressionin the idea, advocated by the Medical Planning Commission andothers, of conducting practice in specially designed and equippedpremises where the group can collaborate and share up-to-dateresources the idea of the Health Centre. The Government agreethat it is in this form that the advantages of the group system can be most fully realised, though it will also be desirable to encourage theidea of grouped practice without special premises. They intend to design the new service so as to give full scope to the Health Centre system.The design of a Health Centre will provide for individual consulting-rooms, for reception and waiting-rooms, for simple laboratory work,for nursing and f ecretarial staff, telephone services and other accessories,as well as in varying degree according to circumstances dark rooms,facilities for minor surgery and other ancillaries.

die National Service will provide. If there is to be that high degreeof confidence between doctor and patient on which the success of thenew scheme will depend, two principles must be observed.First, everyone must be free to choose the doctor whom he consults.Absolute freedom of choice is, of course, impracticable and dees not exist now; the number of doctors in any one neighbourhood is necessarily limited. But there must be freedom to choose from amongthe doctors available.Second, there must be no such regimentation in the scheme as will prevent a doctor from exercising his professional skill in whateverway he believes to be in the best interests of his patient. Yet, if theState is to provide a universal service of family doctors^ there mustbe some degree of State intervention. In particular, the distributionof doctors must be sufficiently controlled to ensure that there iseverywhere an adequate service. The Government believe that their proposals preserve the right degree of balance in this.Developments in medical practiceAnother important point is the need to give free range to modernideas as to the best form of general medical practice. To this problemmuch thought has been given in recent years, particularly by the profession itself. The idea of grouped practice of individual doctorscollaborating with each other in teams in which &quot; many heads are better than one &quot; has received great prominence in professional andother discussions of late. The draft Interim Report of the MedicalPlanning Commission (organised by the British Medical Association)summarises the problem as follows : &quot; Diverse as are the views on the organization of medical services,there is general agreement that co-operation amongst individualgeneral practitioners in a locality is essential to efficient practiceunder modern conditions, though views vary on the form of theco-operation.  The principle of the organization of general practice on a group or co-operative basis is widely approved.&quot;The Government fully agree that &quot; grouped&quot; practices, to whichnumerous privately arranged partnerships point the way, must beplaced in the forefront of their plans for the National Health Service andtheir proposals are designed with this in view.   But the conception of grouped practices cannot represent the whole shape of the futureservice.  In the first place, there has not yet been enough experienceof the idea translated into fact.   Not enough has been found out, bytrial and error, to determine the conditions under which individualdoctors can best collaborate or the extent to which in the long run the public will prefer the group system.   Secondly, it is certain thatthe system could not be adopted everywhere simultaneously.  Thechange, even if experience shows that it should be complete, willtake time.The Government propose, therefore, that the new service shallbe based on a combination of grouped practice and of separate practice,side by side. Grouped practices are more likely to be found suitablein densely populated and highly built-up areas and it is there particularly
(though not exclusively) that they will first be started. It will thenbe possible to watch the development, with the medical profession,and to decide in the light of experience how far and how fast a changeover to this new form of practice should be made.Grouped practice and Health CentresThe conception of grouped practice finds its most usual expressionin the idea, advocated by the Medical Planning Commission andothers, of conducting practice in specially designed and equippedpremises where the group can collaborate and share up-to-dateresources the idea of the Health Centre. The Government agreethat it is in this form that the advantages of the group system can be most fully realised, though it will also be desirable to encourage theidea of grouped practice without special premises. They intend to design the new service so as to give full scope to the Health Centre system.The design of a Health Centre will provide for individual consulting-rooms, for reception and waiting-rooms, for simple laboratory work,for nursing and secretarial staff, telephone services and other accessories,as well as in varying degree according to circumstances dark rooms,facilities for minor surgery and other ancillaries. The object willbe to provide the doctors with first-class premises and equipment and assistance and so give them the best facilities for meeting their patients&apos;needs and saving their own time.The provision of Health Centres will not affect the patienfs freedom to employ the doctor of his choice :, he will be equally free to choosehis doctor, whether the doctor serves in a Health Centre, in groupedpractice outside the Health Centre or in separate practice. Nor will the fact that a doctor is practising in a Health Centre mean that he -will not visit his patient at home, when this is required, just as he does now. Each Centre will need to be so planned as to be regarded U^A-v-dyv^..^by patients, not as a complete break with present habit, but as a new (A;place at which they can continue, if Jhey wish, to see their own doctorin better equipped surroundings. [Tx will be important to avoid an atmosphere of an impersonal clinic,&quot;at&quot; which the doctor&apos;s individualitywould be submerged in an anonymous public service.]In England and Wales the Centres will normallyTfe provided and maintained by county and county borough councils. The provision and distribution of Centres will be in accordance with a general plan for the operation in the area of the National Health Service as a whole.How this plan will be prepared is described later,&apos; but it will be drawnup in consultation with representatives of the medical profession and approved by the Minister. The wish of the local doctors to bring their work into the new Centres must obviously be a big factor in adecision to provide a Centre, but in the last resort the decision will rest on the requirements of the public interest.In Scotland, where the scale of the problem is smaller, the provision and maintenance of Health Centres will be a central responsibilityexercised by the Secretary of State, who will have power to delegatehis functions in this respect to a local authority where, after an initialexperimental period, this is shown to be desirable.
Separate practice in this form of practice the general framework of the national health Insurance scheme will (with important changes from the past)be retained. A doctor in separate practice will engage himself toprovide ordinary medical care and treatment to all persons and familiesaccepted by him under the new arrangements. He will work fromhis own consulting-room and with his own equipment, as he doesnow, but he will be backed by the new organised service of consultants,specialists, hospitals, laboratories and clinics of which he will been abled and expected to make full use for his patients.There will be no interference with the right of a doctor to go onpractising where he is now and at the same time to take part in thenew public service in that area. But for the purpose of securing a proper distribution of doctors some regulation of new entrants into any practice will be necessary.A Central Medical board the Government contemplate that the general practitioner service will, in the main, be centrally organised and that the terms andconditions of service of the doctors taking part in the new scheme will be centrally arranged. As the doctors will be remunerated from public funds, the Minister himself must be ultimately responsiblefor the central administration. The Minister will, however, appoint a Central Medical Board which, acting under his general direction,will be responsible for much of the administration of the practitionerservice. The Secretary of State will appoint a separate CentralMedical Board for Scotland. The Board will in each case be the&quot; employer &quot; of the doctors who take part in the new service andit is consequently with the Board that the individual doctor will bein contract, whether he is engaged in separate practice or in groupor Health Centre practice.In the case of practice in Health Centres it would be impossible toplace on local authorities the duty of providing, maintaining andstaffing the Centres and give them no voice in the employment of the doctors who will v/ork there. In this case, therefore, it is proposedthat there should be a three-party contract between the Board, thelocal authority and the doctor. This will mean that a doctor employedin a Health Centre will be appointed by the Board and the localauthority jointly, with his terms of service centrally negotiated andsettled, and will be liable to have his service in the Centre terminatedonly by the joint decision of the Board and the local authority (or, ifthey fail to agree, by the Minister). This arrangement will not berequired in Scotland, except where responsibility for mamtairiingHealth Centres is delegated by the Secretary of State to a localauthority.The Board will also watch over the general distribution of publicmedical practice. In separate practice it will be the Board to whomapplication for consent must be made before a vacant public practiceis refilled or a new public practice established-a consent whichwould be withheld only if there were already enough or too manys.
doctors in the area. In Health Centre practice it will be the agencythrough which, when vacancies occur, new doctors are introduced into a Centre.The Board will be a small body, under a regular chairman a few of its members being full-time and the rest part-time. Whilst it willbe mainly professional, lay members will also be included. Sincethe Minister will be responsible for its policy, the Board must beappointed by him, but all appointments to it will be made in close consultation with the profession.The local Insurance Committees of the National Health Insurancescheme will be abolished, and their day-to-day functions will be handled in each area by a local Committee of the Board on which local authority members will be included.Remuneration and terms of service of doctorsThe remuneration and terms of service of doctors taking part inthe scheme are matters for discussion with the medical profession.The Government fully recognise the importance and urgency of reaching an understanding upon them and they think it right to putforward their general proposals on the subject.Remuneration. As a mere problem of administration there wouldbe no insuperable difficulty in devising a system under which alldoctors engaged in public practice would be remunerated by salary.But this is a highly controversial question, on which opinions aresharply divided. Many experienced and skilled doctors would be unwilling to take part in a service so conceived. They would holdthat if they became the salaried servants whether of the State or oflocal authorities they would lose their professional freedom and befettered in the exercise of their individual skill. Other doctors,with an equal right to be heard, would welcome a salaried service,believing that it would relieve them from business anxieties and enable them to devote themselves more freely to the practice of theirprofession. Lay opinion is similarly varied. The Government haveapproached the question solely from the point of view of what is needed to make the new service efficient. While they do not believethat a universal change to a salaried system is necessary to the efficientdevelopment of the service, and do not therefore propose this course,they consider that there will be parts of the new serviee to whichdifferent considerations will apply. It seems to the Government tobe fundamental that in Health Centre practice the grouped doctorsworking together in a Centre should not be in competition for patients and that in this form of practice remuneration on a capitation system would be inappropriate. They therefore propose that doctors prac-advertising in Health Centres shall be remunerated by salaries or on some basis other than that of capitation fees, and they will be ready todiscuss with the medical profession the precise system that shouldbe adopted and the salary scales that would be appropriate.It would also be possible, if desired by the doctors themselves, tooffer remuneration by salary or on some similar - basis to doctors
engaged in group practice, even where the practice was not conducted in a Health Centre and, perhaps, in certain circumstances, to doctorsengaged in separate practice. Normally, the remuneration of a doctor in separate practice will be based (as it is now in national health Insurance) on a capitation system, depending on the numberof patients whose care he undertakes the maximum number of patients whose care any one doctor ought to undertake being, ofcourse, suitably regulated.But, whatever methods of payment are adopted capitation fee,salary or other the substantial issue will be to decide what is, on ordinary professional standards, a reasonable and proper remuneration for the whole-time services of a general practitioner working in apublic service. When that has been satisfactorily settled, remunerationunder any system can be easily determined any other issues arisirgin the process being matters of comparative detail.Terms of Service. It is not necessary at this stage to suggest thedetails of the contract into which a doctor who wishes to undertakepublic practice will enter with the Central Medical Board. But the contract will obviously need to provide : (i) for the doctor to give all normal professional advice and services which his proper competence to those whose care he under-takes;(2) for him to comply with the approved local arrangements for obtaining consultant and specialist and hospital services;(3) for proper machinery for the hearing of complaints by patients and for the general kind of disciplinary and appeal procedurealready familiar in National Health Insu rsnce,(4) for the observance of reasonable conditions, centrally determined with the profession, respecting certification and other matters which must arise in any publicly organised service.Private practice it is hoped that most doctors in general practice will take part inthe new service and, therefore, it is not proposed to prohibit doctors who enter the service from also treating in their private practicesany patients who do not desire to take advantage of the new publicarrangements. It will be necessary in such cases to ensure that theinterests of the patients in the public service do not suffer therebyand this will be done by reducing, as may be required, the numberof persons a doctor is permitted to have on his list under the new scheme, and so reducing the remuneration he will receive from public funds. The position of the doctor paid by salary in a Health Centrepresents greater difficulty but, as many doctors will bring most oftheir present practices with them to the public Health Centres, itwill be necessary, during the experimental period at all events, to observe here the same sort of latitude as in the case of separate practice.In any event the volume of private practice will diminish greatlyunder the new scheme; the essential point is that no person mustbe made to believe that he can obtain more skilled or considerate

The Government propose that thisshall be the rule in future, though the Central Medical Board will- ^The^Board must also be able to requirethe young doctor during the early yearsof his career to give his full time tothe public service where the needs of theservice require this. *-vf^The first is that of a public practice in an &quot; over-doctored &quot; area,to the sale of which the Central Medical Board-refuse consent.

On the other hand, the Government considerthat an efficient superannuation system will be an essential part ofthe Health Centre organisation. A doctor entering a Centre willconsequently acquire both superannuation rights and other facilities of considerable value. The proper course will be to strike a fair balance between what he gains and what he loses and to compensatehim accordingly.It would be more difficult to institute a superannuation scheme for doctors engaged in separate practice, but the Government proposeto consider whether an acceptable scheme can be devised to providefor retirement within specified age limits and the granting of super-annuation rights on a contributory basis.Sale and purchase of public practicesThe Government have not overlooked the case which can be madefor aboUshing the sale and purchase of publicly remunerated practices.The abolition would, however, involve great practical difficulty andis not essential to the working of the new service which the government propose. The Government intend, however, to discuss the whole matter further with the profession.

The Government propose that thisshall be the rule in future, though the Central Medical Board willbe empowered to grant exemptions-e.g., where an assistants post isnot reasonably obtainable.   (Lc^d /gWXjCv^C^.  v&apos;V&quot;Compensation and superannuationThe adoption of the proposals made in this Paper would, in certain cases, destroy the selling value of existing medical practices, and where this is so compensation will be paid. Two classes of case, inparticular, are likely to arise.The first is that of a public practice in an &quot; over-doctored &quot; area,to the sale of which the Central Medical Board.refuse consent. Here the out-going doctor or his representatives will be compensated for any loss of value.The second case is that of a doctor who decides to give up his&quot; separate &quot; public practice and to take service in a Health Centre.It would be wholly incompatible with the conception of Health Centrethat individual practices within the Centre should be bought and soldand a doctor will therefore, by entering a Centre, exchange a practicehaving a realisable value for a practice which he will be debarred fromselling on retirement.

to consider the arrangements to be made for the supply of drugs topatients attending Health Centres.As regards medical and surgical appliances, the existing systementitles an insured person to the supply, free of charge, of certainappliances specified in the Medical Benefit Regulations if ordered by a doctor. These &quot; prescribed appliances &quot; are, in the main, the articlesmost commonly required in general practice. In a service which includes treatment of all kinds, whether in or out of hospital, the range of necessary appliances will have to be greatly extended; but, as was indicated in the Beveridge Report, it will be a matter for consideration whether the patient himself should not be called upon, if his financial resources permit, to contribute towards the cost of the more expensiveappliances or at least of repairs and replacements. This point willbe of particular importance in connection with the dental and ophthalmic services.IllHOSPITALSDeficiencies in the present system a  fully organised system of hospitals will be the keystone of theNational Health Service. The new hospital service must be complete and ready of access. It must include general and special hospitals,infectious disease hospitals, sanatoria for tuberculosis, accommodation for maternity cases, for the chronic sick and for rehabilitation. Ancillaryhospital services must also be provided for pathological examination,X-ray, electro-therapy, ambulances, and other purposes.The high standard which many of the leading hospitals haveattained needs no recommendation. They have shown the way inthe development of hospital technique. But there are weaknesses inthe present system and, to remedy these, two main problems have tobe solved. The first is to determine the areas most suitable for hospital organisation, and bring together in a working plan for each area the various separate and independent hospitals. The second isto enable the two main hospital systems to work closely together infuture for a common purpose.The voluntary hospital movement is well known in this country,not only as the oldest established hospital system here, but also as a movement which attracts the interest and support of many people who believe in it as a social organisation and wish to see it maintained.Its co-operation is essential to the success of the new service, side by side with the other steadily developing system of the publicly providedhospitals of the local authorities. The Governments proposals are based on the fullest co-operation of this kind between the two hospitalsystems in one common service.At present hospitals are not linked as they should be with one another and with other health services, and their distribution is uneven.They have grown up without a national or even an area plan. In one12
area there may be already established a variety of good hospitals.Another area, although the need is there, is sparsely served. Onehospital may have a long waiting list and be refusing admission to cases which another hospital not far away could suitably accommodate andtreat at once. There is undue pressure in some areas on the hospitalout-patient departments in spite of certain experiments which someof the hospitals have tried (and which should be encouraged) in arranging a system of timed appointments to obviate long waiting.Moreover, even though most people have access to a hospital of some kind, it is not necessarily access to the right hospital. The tendency in the modern development of medicine and surgery is towardsspecialist centres for radio-therapy and neurosis, for example andno one hospital can be equally equipped and developed to suit allneeds, or to specialise equally in all subjects. The time has come when the hospital services have to be planned as a wider whole, withthe object of securing that each case shall be referred, not necessarilyto the particular hospital which happens to be &quot; local,&quot; but to whateverhospital can offer the most up-to-date technique for that kind of case.To achieve this object and to remedy the present lack of coherence,there is need of a single authority which has the duty to secure in thearea for which it is responsible a complete hospital service.The unit of administrationAt present, hospital services which are publicly provided are mainly in the hands of county and county borough councils. The Governmenthave no desire to disturb unnecessarily the present form of localgovernment organisation or to interfere without cause in the work ofthese major local authorities. Indeed, it is their intention to basethe local organisation of the new Health Service generally on thesemajor authorities, operating over their own areas where possible andcombining in larger joint areas only where necessary.But it is abundantly clear that, with a few exceptions, counties and county boroughs are not large enough to serve as the area on which a unified hospital service could be based. For the purpose an area mustfulfil three conditions : (a) Its population and financial resources must be sufficient to make possible an adequate, efficient and economical service.(b) It should normally include both urban and rural areas so thatthe needs of town and country can be properly balanced.(c) It should be such that most of the varied hospital and specialist services can be organised within its boundaries in a self-sufficientscheme (leaving for inter-area arrangement only certain specialisedservices).In the great majority of the counties and county boroughs these three conditions would not be met.The Government therefore propose that responsibility for the newhospital service shall be entrusted to new joint authorities, which willbe formed by combining for the purpose the existing county and county borough councils in joint boards operating over areas to be
settled by the Minister after consultation with local interests at the outset of the scheme. There will be some exceptional cases (theCounty of London is the most obvious) where combination will be unnecessary. The powers and duties of the present hospital authorities will be transferred to the new joint authorities, who will take overthe ownership and management of ail publicly owned hospitals.An area hospital plan the first task of each new joint authority will be to assess thehospital needs of its area and the available hospital resources, and towork out a plan of hospital arrangements for the area, based on using,adapting and where necessary supplementing the existing resources.All this will be done in consultation with local professional opinion and other local interests, including the voluntary hospitals. The plan will then be submitted to the Minister for approval and will have novahdity until so approved.The approved plan will define the parts to be played by the varioushospitals, both the hospitals of the joint authority and the voluntary hospitals. Voluntary hospitals will not be compelled to participate in the plan but the Government trust that they will not hesitate todo so since their collaboration will be of great importance to thesuccess of the new hospital service. Indeed, without this collaborationit would be many years before the new joint authorities could buildup a system adequate for the needs of the whole population.Voluntary hospitalsSome voluntary hospitals may fear that participation in the nationalservice would lead in the course of time to a change in their status,and thus injure or even destroy the voluntary movement. That is neither the wish nor the intention of the Government.Where a voluntary hospital agrees to participate in the new service,its participation will rest on a contract with the joint authority underwhich the hospital will undertake to provide the services specified inthe area plan, and to abide by conditions applying to all hospitals andsettled centrally for the country as a whole. A voluntary hospitalaccepting these arrangements will receive certain service payments from the joint authority these service payments being in accord with centrally determined scales, and being less in amount than thetotal cost of the service rendered (for if the voluntary system is to bemaintained, the voluntary hospital will still rely in large measure onits own resources on personal benefaction and the continuing supportof all who believe in the voluntary hospital movement). It will also receive from central funds certain payments in respect of its help inthe scheme payments which can, if the hospitals wish, be pooled inone fund from which the actual distribution to each hospital can take account of its particular needs. There will be no question of any interference in the management of voluntary hospitals, of the sur-render by them of their independence and autonomy, or of any changein their status.The Government will discuss their proposals in detail with repre-
1&quot;]sentatives of the voluntary hospitals and they trust that it will be-1-possible without infringing the principles on which they believe theNational Health Service should be founded to avoid any risk of injury to the voluntary movement, and to ensure the cordialcollaboration of the voluntary hospitals in the new service.Mental HospitalsThe inclusion of the mental hospitals in the National Health Servicepresents some difficulty until a full restatement of the law of lunacyand mental deficiency can be undertaken. Yet, despite the difficulties,the mental health services should be taken over by the new joint authority. This will be in accord with the principle, declared by theRoyal Commission on Mental Disorder, that the treatment of mentaldisorder should approximate as nearly to the treatment of physicalailments as is consistent with the special safeguards which areindispensable when the liberty of the subject is infringed.Hospitals for infectious diseaseIn the counties isolation hospitals for infectious diseases are withfew exceptions owned and administered by the minor authorities andnot by the county councils, and their transfer to the new joint authority will mean that their present owners will give up ownership withoutretaining even the part interest which membership of the new joint authority will afford in the case of hospitals belonging to county and county borough councils.The case for this absolute transfer of the isolation hospitals hasnothing to do with the past record of the minor authorities, nor is itin any way a reflection upon the quality of the work which they havehitherto done. The whole trend of medical opinion has for some time been in favour of treating these hospitals, not primarily as places forthe reception of patients to prevent the spread of infection, but ashospitals where severe and complicated cases of infectious diseasecan receive expert treatment and nursing. The small isolationhospital of the past century is not only uneconomic in days of rapidtransport but cannot reasonably be expected to keep abreast of modernmethods. One result of the new outlook will be the development, inaddition to the larger isolation hospital serving the densely populatedarea, of accommodation for infectious diseases in blocks forming partof the general hospitals. These considerations all indicate that theinfectious disease hospitals must in future form part of the general hospital system.Inspection of HospitalsApart from special inspections to enquire into difficulties that have arisen or changes that are in contemplation, routine inspections atnot too frequent intervals will serve the double purpose of bringing to notice defects of organisation or management and, what is equally important, of enabling individual hospitals to be kept in touch withthe latest practice and ideas. The foundation of any inspectorate must clearly be a team of highly qualified medical men, but the inspectorsis
need not all be persons employed whole-time on this work ; there areadvantages in employing on a part-time basis medical men or womendistinguished in various branches of professional work or medicaladministration. In addition to doctors, there is scope for experts ofvarious kinds for dealing with an organisation so varied and complexas a modern hospital. Hospital administrators, accountants, nurses,engineers, catering and kitchen experts to mention no others should find a place.A solution would be the appointment by the Minister of a body ofpersons of the types mentioned, some on a whole-time and others ona part-time basis, grouped in suitable panels operating over different areas of the country. The part-time doctors would be selected partly from those associated with consultant practice and voluntary hospitals and partly from those with experience of municipal hospitals.IVCONSULTANTSA Consultant Service based on HospitalsPerhaps the most marked gap in the range of health services provided under the present National Health Insurance scheme is the lack ofa consultant service. But it is not only among persons insured underthe scheme that the need for such a service is felt, and a properlyorganised consultant service which will be fair to the consultantsthemselves and will ensure that everyone can obtain, whenever heneeds it and without charge, the skilled advice of a specialist musthave an important place in the new National Health Service.The Government consider that a service of consultants can be best and most naturally based on the hospital services.This means that it will become one of the duties of the joint authorityto see that, through the various hospitals taking part, there will beprovided an adequate consultant service which will ensure that theco-operation of consultants and specialists is fully available to allgeneral practitioners in the service. It will do this, as in other,branches of the hospital service, partly by its own direct arrangement and partly by contracting with the voluntary hospitals the arrange-ments made forming part of the local plan. The authority will arrange for the voluntary hospital to provide consultant services both at the hospital and, where necessary, by visits to a clinic or health centre or the patient&apos;s home. The hospital will itself enter into thenecessary engagements with the consultants and specialists concerned.The local service payments to the hospitals, already mentioned, willbe based on the assumption of a consultant staff properly remuneratedto enable the hospital to fulfil the tasks which it had undertaken to perform.Some principles affecting consultant servicesBefore suggesting in detail the form of a consultant service the
Government are awaiting the report of the Committee on medical schools now sitting under the chairmanship of Sir William Goodenough.Meanwhile some general considerations of which account will betaken in devising the new service can be mentioned.There are not yet enough men and women of real consultant status and one of the aims will be to encourage more doctors of the righttype to enter this branch of medicine or surgery and to provide themeans for their training.There is also need for a more even distribution. The main con-sultant facilities are now inevitably concentrated at the medical teachingcentres. The consultant service still needs to be organised withthe teaching centre as its focus, but the service must be spread overa wider area by enabling and encouraging consultants taking partin it to live and work farther afield. Apart from greater accessibilityto the public, this will also have a beneficial effect upon general medical practice over larger areas where the habitual presence and servicesof consultants will serve as a means of continuing postgraduateeducation.The consultant taking part in the service must be associated withhis particular hospital or hospitals on a much more regular basis and with more regular attendances and duties than is often the casenow, when he is regarded as merely &quot; on call.&quot; It will often bedesirable that he should be associated with more than one majorhospital, so that the sharing of a common consultant staff may become an effective link between hospitals. His normal function will be theregular and frequent visiting of these hospitals, both for in-patient andfor out-patient consultation; also the visiting of outlying &quot; general practitioner&quot; hospitals, which need to be linked with the majorhospitals; also, for certain consultants as circumstances may require,the visiting of Health Centres and clinics, and, in case of need, atthe request of the general practitioner, of patients in their homes.For this sort of duty the proper and regular remuneration of con-consultants, through the hospitals with which they are associated, willbecome essential. This remuneration, and the engagements enteredinto in respect of it, can be on either a full-time or a part-time basis(and might well include part-time engagements with more than onehospital).The terms and conditions for these consultants will be a matter for the authorities of the hospitals, voluntary or municipal, whichoffer the appointments ; but in order to avoid anomalies as betweenhospital and hospital and between area and area some central regulationof remuneration will be required.There will also be need for some control over the discretion of individual hospital authorities in making appointments to seniorclinical posts. Under existing practice there is a danger of &quot; in-breeding &quot;; and, while the ultimate responsibility for an appoint-ment should rest unmistakably with the body of persons conductingthe hospitaPs affairs, there is much to be said for a system under
which an expert advisory body would recommend a number of suitablecandidates from which the hospital authority would make the finalchoice.VCLINICS AND OTHER LOCAL SERVICESServices required the National Health Service must include arrangements for homenursing, midwifery and health visiting; it must also include thelocal clinics and similar services which are now provided for maternity and child welfare and other special purposes, or which may have tobe provided in the future. In England and Wales, the joint authority will have the duty of including all these local services in their generalplan for the area and ensuring that they are properly related to eachother and to the other parts of the National Service and are arranged in the right way and in the right place to meet the area&apos;s needs. Theplan, as approved by the Minister, will finally determine in each area which of the services are to be provided and maintained by thecounty and county borough councils and which by the joint authority.Different arrangements will be necessary in Scodand, but the general principle in both countries will be that all the local services whichbelong to the sphere of general health care will rest with the majorlocal authority, while those which belong to the hospital and consultantsphere will rest with the new joint authority.Increasing importance of work in clinicsAs time goes on and the new scheme gets into its stride, there willbe room for experiment and innovations in the way in which these various local services are provided. In particular, there will beopportunities for associating the family doctor more closely with thework of special clinics e.g., child welfare centres. But, whateverdevelopments there may be in the clinics and other locally providedservices, the introduction of the new service will not mean that any existing facilities are abandoned, but rather that they will be increased and strengthened to meet the wider objects in view.The way in which the Governments proposals, based on these principles, will affect the various services is described below.Maternity and child welfare services the arrangement of lying-in accommodation in hospital or maternityhome (indeed ail the institutional provision for maternity, both for normal and for complicated cases) will become part of the reorganisedhospital and consultant services and will be the responsibility of thenew joint authority.   The ordinary functions of the maternity and
child welfare clinics, however concerned, as they are, not primarily with direct medical treatment but more with giving advice on the bringing-up of young children and the problems of motherhood-will notbe transferred to the new joint authority, but will lie wherever the related functions of child education are made by Parliament to lie under the new Education Bill. Under the present proposals in that bill, this will mean that the county and comity borough councils willbe the authorities primarily responsible, but that arrangements willbe made in suitable cases for the delegation of much of the practicalcare of the service to existing authorities, within the counties, whichhave hitherto carried the responsibility and have accumulated goodexperience and local interest.In Scotland there will be no change in the present arrangementsfor maternity and child welfare centres which are already being administered by the major local authorities there, the county councils and the town councils of the large burghs.School Medical service for this service also the Governmenfs proposals are related to theproposals in the Education Bill. It is contemplated that the educationauthorities will retain as part of their educational machinery thefunctions of inspection of children in the school group (the supervision,in fact, of the state of health in which the child attends school andof the effects of school life and activities on the child&apos;s health), togetherwith the important function of using the influence of the school toensure that the child receives any medical treatment he requires.But, as from the time when the new Health Service is able to take over its comprehensive care of health, the child will look for treatment to that service.Tuberculosis dispensaries and other infectious disease work  the local tuberculosis dispensaries will in future be regarded asout-patient centres of the hospital and consultant services, and responsibility for them will normally rest directly with the new joint authority dealing with the whole of this aspect of the new service over its wider area.Similarly, isolation hospital responsibilities will pass to the newjoint authority as part of the general hospital problem of its area.But many of the measures dealing with the notification of diseasesand the local control of the spread of infection, which are already thesubject of statutory powers under the Public Health Acts, can stillbe suitably carried out locally in the different parts of the joint authority&apos;s area, although most of these activities will probably infuture have to be centred in the county and county borough councilsrather than distributed more widely, as they are now,&apos; among the minor authorities.Cancer centresResponsibility for the local centres of diagnosis and advice whichwere contemplated when the Cancer Act of 1939 was passed, but have
had little chance to develop substantially during the war, will passwith the other responsibilities of that Act to the new joint authorities as a part of the general hospital and consultant service.Venereal diseasesThe service for venereal diseases is at present in the hands of thecounty and county borough councils, and its allocation between those authorities and the new joint authority presents difficulty. Inone sense it is essentially a clinic service which could continue to belocally organised within the framework of the new general area plan and need not be regarded as part of the wider hospital and consultantfield. The newly developing use started during the war of the help of individual general practitioners to supplement the work ofthe chnics lends some point to this. On the other hand, it is a servicerequiring a high degree of specialisation and it is a matter of con-venience one which is usually attached to hospital premises; theseare factors which point to associating it with the reorganised hospital service. It is something of a &quot; border-line &quot; case, and will be bestleft to be determined in the settlement of the area plan in each case.New ServicesHome nursing. A full home nursing service must be one of the aims of the new service. How far it needs to be directly providedby public authority, or indirectly by arrangements made with other bodies, or both, will be matters for discussion. Its object must be toensure that those who need nursing attention in their homes will beable to obtain it without charge through the new service.It is contemplated that the task of securing this will be entrusted to county and county borough councils.Dental and ophthalmic services. A full dental service for the whole population, including regular conservative treatment, must unques-tionably form part of the new National Health Service. But thereare not at present, and will not be for some years to come, enoughdentists in the country to provide it. Until the supply can be increasedattention will have to be concentrated on priority needs. These must include the needs of children and young people, of expectant and nursing mothers, and it is these needs which must first be met. Thewhole dental problem is a peculiarly difficult one, and a committee under the chairmanship of Lord Teviot has been set up by the twoHealth Ministers to consider and report on it.There may be similar (though perhaps less acute) difficulties in getting a full service in ophthalmology. But these, like the difficultiesin dentistry, must be treated rather as practical problems arising inthe operation of a new service than as matters of doubt in planningits scope and objectives.Health Centres. The arrangements for the local provision ofHealth Centres have been already mentioned as the responsibilitynormally of the county and county borough councils.
ADMINISTRATIONCentral organisation the main lines on which the Government propose that the new national Health Service shall be organised will have become clear from the arrangements already described for the various parts of theservice. But the form of organisation contemplated may be easier to understand if it is summarised here as a whole. Moreover, thereare important proposals affecting the administration of the new service which have not yet been mentioned.It is proposed that central responsibility for the National service shall rest on the two Health Ministers. Indeed, no other arrangementis possible, having regard to the magnitude of the scheme and thelarge sums of public money that will be involved.While the service will thus be under general Ministerial control,only one part of it (the new general practictioner service) will bein the main centrally administered, and for most parts of the new service the principle already adopted in the majority of the health services in the past the principle of local responsibility, with co-ordination at the centre will be similarly adopted in the future. Inthe general practitioner service, however, much of the day-to-day administration will be carried out, under the general directions ofthe Health Ministers, by the two Central Medical Boards already described.Central Health Services CouncilAlthough it is on the Health Ministers that responsibility toParliament for the new Health Service must rest, the government attach great importance to ensuring that the service is shaped and operated in close association with professional and expert opinion.The provision of a health service involves technical issues of thehighest importance, and in its administration, both centrally ar.dlocally, the guidance of the expert must be available and must not go unheeded.   Otherwise the quality of the service is bound to suffer.The Government propose, therefore, that there shall be set up by statute at the side of the Minister a special professional and expertbody, to be called the Central Health Services Council. &quot;Its functionwill be to express the expert view on technical aspects of the health service. The Council will differ from the Central Medical board in that it will be a consultative and advisory body, and not as theBoard will be an executive body responsible under the Ministersdirection for a defined part of the administration of the new Service.The Council will be entitled to advise, not only on matters referredto it by the Minister, but on any matters within its province on whichit thinks it right to express an expert opinion. A duty will be placedon the Minister apart from any other publication of the CounciFsadvice or views which he may make from time to time to submitannually to Parliament a report on the CounciPs work during the year.
The constitution of the Council will be considered in detail withthe professional and other organisations concerned. It must be primarily medical in its make-up though not wholly so, because it-will be required to express views on many questions, e.g., of hospitaladministration, dentistry, nursing and pharmacy, which will involve. experts other than the surgeon or physician. It is contemplated thatit might consist of some thirty or forty members, representing themain medical organisations, the voluntary and publicly ownedhospitals (with both medical and lay representation) and professionslike dentistry, pharmacy and nursing. The Council will be appointedby the Minister in consultation with the appropriate professionalbodies, and it will select its own chairman and regulate its ownprocedure. The Minister will be prepared to provide the secretariat and the expenses of the Council will be met from public funds.A similar but separate body will be set up for scotland  by theSecretary of State.Local organisation in framing their proposals for the local organisation of the newHealth Service, the Government have been anxious to interfere as little as possible with the shape of representative local government.They have set out to base the new service as far as possible on theexisting major local authorities, the county and county borough councils. But the requirements of the service will usually demand,for certain purposes, larger areas of operation or planning than thepresent counties and county boroughs can usually provide; forthese purposes therefore it will be necessary for the counties and county boroughs to act in combination as joint authorities establishedover appropriate areas by the Minister, rather than in their separatecapacities over their present areas. Thus, for reasons stated earlier,it is essential to its efficiency that the new hospital service shall bebased, with a few exceptions, on areas larger than counties and county boroughs, and it is on this ground that the Government have proposed the establishment of joint authorities to administer that service aproposal which still maintains for the county and county borough councils an interest in hospital administration inasmuch as they willbe the constituent bodies of the new combined authority.It is clear, for reasons also given already, that the joint authorityresponsible for the hospital service must also be responsible for theconsultant service and such clinic and other local services as need to be organised in close association with the hospitals.Preparation of local area planOne further and important duty will be placed on the new joint authorities that of preparing a rational and effective plan for all branches of the Health Service in their area.The preparation of this plan has been referred to already in the description of the arrangements for the hospital and other individual services.   But the intention is that the plan shall cover, not merely
the particular services which the joint authority will itself administer,put the whole range of services of which the National Health service will be composed. Unless provision is made for the interlockingof the various parts of the service it cannot possess the coherenceand unity of purpose which are essential features of the governments proposals.The preparation of a comprehensive plan of this kind is a functionappropriate to the joint authority and not to its constituent members.The plan will be submitted to the Minister for approval, and whenapproved it will determine how the needs of the area in terms ofgeneral practice, hospitals, consultants, clinics and all other necessaryservices are to be met and will define, subject to the principles laiddown, the responsibilities of the various authorities.The plan will be open to amendment at any time by the same procedure. Both in its preparation and in its amendment the authority will fully consult local professional and expert opinion, through the medium of a Local Health Services Council.Local Health Services CouncilsExpert guidance is no less needed locally than it is at the centre.To meet the local need the Government propose that there shall beestablished, for the area of every joint authority, a Local health services Council. These Councils will be the local counterparts ofthe Central Health Services Council. Their constitution will call for more detailed consideration later but, provided that all the professional interests are fairly represented, there is no reason whythe pattern should be precisely imiform everywhere and the matter might be dealt with by local schemes approved by the Minister. the council&apos;s will be able to advise, not only on matters referred to themby the joint authority or other local authorities in the area, but alsoto initiate advice on any matters within their expert province on whichthey think it right to do so. They will be free, if they wish, to submit their views and advice not only to the joint authority or, on matters affecting other local authorities in the area, to those authorities, but alsoto the Minister. The joint authority will be required to consult theCouncil on the area plan for the health service before it is submittedto the^Minister, and on any subsequent material alterations or additions to the plan.vii the SERVICE IN SCOTLANDCertain differences essentialThe scope and purpose of the National Health Service will be thesame in Scotland as it is in England and Wales, but the administrative structure of the service in the two countries cannot be identical.
Account must be taken of certain differences of geography and localgovernment organisation in Scotland. For example, about 80 per cent,of Scodand&apos;s population is concentrated in about 17 per cent, of thetotal area of the country, across its industrial &quot; waist.&quot; Outside theindustrial belt are large, and for the most part sparsely populated areas. Of the 55 existing health authorities in Scotland only 10 havepopulations of more than 100,000, and 32 have a population of under50,000. Against this, the population of England and Wales is on thewhole much more urbanised and the local government units are largerwith correspondingly greater resources.There will be no substantial difference in the central machinery to be set up in Scotland as compared with England and Wales, butthe arrangements proposed for the local organisation of the service will need to be modified to suit the special circumstances of Scotland.Regional Hospitals Advisory councils in England and Wales the new joint authorities will have the dualfunction of administering the hospital and allied services and of planning the health service as a whole. To make a similar arrangement in scotland would usually be out of the question, since the areas would be toobig and unwieldy to serve as administrative units. The point can best be illustrated in relation to the hospital service. Successive committees on hospital problems have emphasised the need for planning andco-ordinating the hospital service in Scotland over wider areas, andfor this purpose have recommended the selection of the four naturalregions based on the Cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen andDundee, where the key hospitals as well as the medical schools are tobe found, with a fifth based for geographical reasons on Inverness.Although areas of this size are necessary for the planning and co-ordination of a comprehensive hospital service, they are clearly too large to serve as administrative units. This means that co-ordinationof the hospital service and responsibility for its actual provision have in Scotland to be separated in a way which does not apply to Englandand Wales.Accordingly the Government propose to adopt the recommendations made by various Committees, including the Committee on ScottishHealth Services and the Hetherington Committee, that a RegionalHospitals Advisory Council should be set up in each of the five regionsreferred to. The Council will consist of members nominated in equal numbers by the Joint Hospitals Boards of the combined localauthorities in the region, described in the next paragraph, and by the voluntary hospitals, and an independent chairman will be appointedby the Secretary of State. In addition, it might include a small numberof representatives of the medical and medical-educational interests ofthe region.The functions of the Councils will be consultative and advisory.They will advise the Secretary of State on the measures necessary tosecure the co-ordination of the hospital and consultant services which the region.
Joint Hospitals BoardsThe actual administration of the hospital and consultant services will be entrusted to Joint Hospitals Boards to be set up for smallerareas within the regions. The Boards will be composed entirely ofrepresentatives from the county councils and the town councils of large burghs in the area concerned. They will take over the whole ownership and responsibility for the hospitals of their constituent authorities,will be charged with the statutory duty of securing a proper hospital service for their area-by their own provision and by arrangements with other Joint Hospitals Boards or voluntary hospitals and willin fact be, so far as executive responsibility for the hospital service is concerned, the counterparts of the new joint authorities in Englandand Wales.The Joint Hospitals Boards will have the duty of preparing a schemefor the hospital services of their area, after consultation with the voluntary hospitals. They will be encouraged also to consult the regional Hospitals Advisory Council at this stage to secure the fullestmeasure of agreement between the area plan and the wider regionalarrangements proposed by the Council. The Joint Hospitals Board will then submit their scheme to the Secretary of State, who will consult the Regional Hospitals Advisory Council to obtain their final views before deciding to approve or amend the scheme.Clinics and other services the arrangements proposed for the planning and administrationof the clinic services in England and Wales will also require some modification in their application to Scotland. The same general principle will be observed namely, that the services more nearlyallied to the hospital service will be made the responsibility of thenew Joint Boards. Tuberculosis dispensaries and cancer clinics arethe most notable examples. As the Joint Hospitals Boards will haveno planning functions outside the hospital and consultant sphere,it is proposed to leave the remainder of the clinic services wherethey now are, in the hands of the major health authorities, and togive power to the Secretary of State to require these authorities(after a public local inquiry) to combine for any purpose where thisis proved necessary for the efficiency of the new health service as awhole.Local Medical Services committees the only remaining differences between the proposals for Englandand Wales and those for Scotland relate to the general practitionerservice ; they are two.The first proposal that in Scotland Health Centres will be providedaiU maintained by the Secretary of State and the reasons for it havealready been explained (page 8).The second is that, in lieu of the Local Health Services councils to be set up in England and Wales there will be created in Scotland,
for every Joint Board area, a Local Medical Services Committee.The Committees will be to some extent similar to the Councils, butthey will have a wider function. It will be their duty both to advise the Secretary of State on the development of the general practitionerservice the need for Health Centres, for example and to act as a means of liaison between the general practitioner service and theother parts of the health service.With these wider functions in view it is proposed that the LocalMedical Services Committees shall consist of representatives of allthe major local authorities in the area, of the local medical, dental,pharmaceutical and nursing professions, and of other interests closely concerned with the health services.VIIIFINANCECost to public fundsIt is not possible within the limits of a short paper to explain indetail how the new Health Service will be financed; for that, referencemust be made to the White Paper itself. But the present paper would not be complete if it did not give some indication of the scale of expenditure involved and of how it will be met.It is estimated that in England and Wales the total annual cost ofthe National Health Service to public funds will be not less than 132 millions, as compared with about  55 millions from public fundsspent on the present health services.Of this sum of  132 millions about  70 millions will be spent bythe new joint authorities on the hospital, consultant and other services which they will provide and maintain themselves, including payments made to voluntary hospitals for their services under the area plan.About  22 millions will be spent by county and county borough councils on the services for which they are to be directly responsible.The State will itself spend directly about  30 millions on the newgeneral practitioner service including payments to chemists.(The remaining  10 millions is the part of the expenditure of voluntary hospitals which will be met by a direct grant from theState.)State grantsApart from its own direct expenditure on the general practitionerservice, the State will give grants to local authorities and to voluntary hospitals.   The arrangements proposed are as follows : (1) A hospital grant of  100 a bed ( 35 in mental hospitals andinfectious disease hospitals, because of their lower comparativecosts and because the scheme broadly does not impose any
additional duties on local authorities for treatment in these cases)will be paid to joint authorities in aid of the hospital and consultantservice. A similar grant will be paid to voluntary hospitals (the 10 millions referred to above.)(2) Every new service, other than the hospital and consultantservice, will be assisted by a 50 per cent, grant which will bepaid to the authority responsible for the service.(3) When the above grants have been paid the joint authorities will meet the remainder of their expenditure by precept upon their constituent county and county borough councils. Thesecouncils will meet the precept and their expenditure on their ownservices by a rate charge, but the charge will be mitigated byan additional Exchequer grant amounting to 50 per cent, of theincrease in the total cost of the health services in any year overthe cost in a selected standard year. The grant will be adjusted to give more help to poor areas and less to rich.Cost to taxpayer and ratepayerHow far the central funds will consist of, or be assisted by, sums of money set aside out of contributions under a social insurancescheme will be considered later. The Beveridge Report proposedthat an annual sum of about  40 millions should be available from this source for the new health services. Of this, nearly  36 millions wouldbe the share appropriate to England and Wales, and if this assistance is assumed the approximate proportions in which the total cost of thenew service will fall on the social insurance scheme, the taxpayer andthe ratepayer will be (ignoring the effect of the block grant under theLocal Government Act, 1929), as follows : Social Insurance Scheme ..      ..       36    millions.Taxpayer........       48 ,,Ratepayer   ..      ..       ..       ..       48 ,, 132Finance in ScotlandIt is estimated on the same basis that the total cost to public funds of the scheme in Scotland will be nearly  16 millions of which about $\ millions will be spent by the State on the practitioner serviceand health centres, about  8.0 millions by the new joint boards,about  3 millions by the County and large burgh Councils and about i\ millions will be paid direct to voluntary hospitals.If it is assumed that Scotland&apos;s share of any appropriation fromthe Social Security Fund will be about  4% millions (corresponding tothe figure of nearly  36 millions for England and Wales) the total costof the new service will fall on the Social Security Scheme, the taxpayerand the ratepayer in approximately the following proportions : Social Insurance Scheme ..      ..      j 4-3 millionsTaxpayer    ..       ..       . .       . .       6.1      ,,Ratepayer........       5.4 15-8
SUMMARY OF PROPOSALSScope of ike new Service.(a) A National Health Service will be established. This NationalService will be available to every citizen in England, Scodandand Wales.(b) There will be nothing in the new service to prevent those whoprefer to make their own private arrangements for medical attention from doing so. But, for all who wish to.use the service it willprovide, without charge, a complete range of personal healthcare general and specialist, at home, in the hospital and elsewhere.Structure of the Service.(a) Central.(i) Central responsibility to Parliament and the people willhe with the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State forScotland.(ii) At the side of the Minister there will be a professional andexpert advisory body to be called the Central Health ServicesCouncil. The Council will be a statutory body and its functionwill be to provide professional guidance on technical aspects ofthe Health Service.  There will be a similar body in Scotland.(b) Local.(i) Local responsibility will be based on the county and county borough councils, which are the major local governmentauthorities now. They will administer the new service partly intheir present separate capacities over their present areas, partly-as the needs of the service require by combined action in joint boards over larger areas.(ii) Areas suitable in size and resources for hospital organisation will be designated by the Minister after consultation with local interests.(iii) The county and county borough councils in each area willcombine to form a joint authority to administer the hospital,consultant and allied services ; in the few cases where the areacoincides with an existing county area the authority will be thecounty council of that area.(iv) At the side of each new joint authority there will be a consultative body professional and expert to be called theLocal Health Services Council.(v) Each joint authority will also prepare in consultation withthe Local Health Services Council and submit for the ministers approval an &quot; area plan &quot; for securing a comprehensive health service of all kinds in its area.
(vi) County and county borough councils combining for these duties of the new joint authority will also severally be responsiblefor the local clinic and other services in accordance with thearea plan. Responsibility for child welfare will be speciallyassigned in whatever way child education is assigned under thecurrent Education Bill.Hospital and consultant Services.(a) It will be the duty of the joint authorities themselves to secure a complete hospital and consultant service for their area includingsanatoria, isolation, mental health services, and ambulance and ancillary services in accordance with the approved area plan.(b) The joint authorities will do this both by direct provision andby contractual arrangements with voluntary hospitals (or withother joint authorities) as the approved area plan may indicate.(c) The powers of present local authorities in respect of these services and the ownership of their hospitals will pass to thejoint authority.(d) Voluntary hospitals will participate, if willing to do so, asautonomous and contracting agencies ; if so, they will observe the approved area plan, and certain national conditions applying to all hospitals in the new service alike; they will perform theservices for which they contract under the plan, and receive variousservice payments from both central and local funds.(e) Special provision will be made for inspection of the hospital service through centrally selected expert personnel.(f) Consultant services will be made available to all, at the hospitals,local centres, or clinics, or in the home, as required; they willb; based on the hospital service, and arranged by the joint authority, either directly or by contract with voluntary hospitalsunder the approved area plan.(g) Measures for improving the distribution of consultants, dealingwith methods of appointment and remuneration, and relatingthe consultant service to other branches of the new servicegenerally, will be considered after the report of the &quot; GoodenoughCommittee.&quot;4. General Medical Practice.(a) Everyone will be free, under the new Health Service, to choosea doctor the freedom of choice being limited, as now, only bythe number of doctors available and the amount of work which each doctor can properly undertake.(b) Medical practice in the new service will be a combination ofgrouped and separate practice.
Grouped practice means practice by a group of doctors working in co-operation.Separate practice means practice by a doctor working on hisown account broadly similar to practice under the presentNational Health Insurance scheme, but with important changes.(c) Grouped practice will be conducted normally, though notexclusively, in specially equipped and publicly provided health centres. In England and Wales, the Centres will be provided and maintained by county and county borough councils inScotland, by the Secretary of State with power to delegate to alocal authority.(d) General practice in the National Health Service will be inthe main organised centrally under the responsible health ministers. All the main terms and conditions of the doctor&apos;sparticipation will be centrally settled, and much of the day-to-day administration will be the function of Central Medical Boards one for England and Wales and one for Scotland largelyprofessional in composition, and acting under the general directionof the Health Ministers.(e) The main duties of each Board will be : (i) to act as the &quot; employer &quot; of the doctors engaged in thepublic service. Thus, the Board will be the body with whomevery doctor will enter into contract. In the case of practice in health Centres in England and Wales, however, there will be athree-party contract between the Board, the local authority andthe doctor.(ii) To ensure a proper distribution of doctors throughoutthe country. For this purpose the Board will have power toprevent the taking over of an existing public practice or the setting up of a new public practice in an area which is already&quot;over-doctored.&quot;(f) It is not proposed that there should be a universal salaried system for doctors in the new service. Doctors engaged in Health Centreswill be remunerated by salary or the equivalent ; doctors inseparate practice normally by capitation fee. In some cases-e.g. grouped practice not based on a Health Centre remunerationby salary or the equivalent could be arranged if the doctorsconcerned so desired. Rates of remuneration will be discussed with the medical profession.(g) It is not proposed to prohibit doctors in public practice fromengaging also in private practice for any patients who still wantthis. Where a doctor undertakes private in addition to publicpractice, the number of patients he is permitted to take under theNational Service and consequently his remuneration will be adjusted.(h) Young doctors entering individual practice in the public service
for the first time will normally be required to serve for a period as assistants to more experienced practitioners.(j) Compensation will be paid to any doctor who loses the valueof his practice e.g. by entering a Health Centre or because he is prohibited from transferring the practice to another doctor onthe ground that there are too many doctors in the area.Superannuation schemes will be provided for doctors in health centres and the possibility of providing them in other forms of practice will be discussed with the profession, and the practicability of abolishing the sale and purchase of public practices will be similarly discussed.(k) Arrangements for the supply of drugs and medical applianceswill be considered and discussed with the appropriate bodies.5,  Clinics and other services.(a) It will be the duty of the joint authority to include in its areaplan provision for all necessary clinics and other local services(e.g., child welfare, home nursing, health visiting, midwiferyand others), and to provide for the co-ordination of these services with the other services in the plan.(b) County and county borough councils will normally providemost of these local services. The exact allocation of responsibility between the joint authority and the individual county and countyborough councils will be finally settled in each case in the approved area plan; but the principle will be that services be-longing to the hospital and consultant sphere will fall to thejoint authority while other local and clinic services will fall tothe individual councils.(c) Child welfare duties will always fall to the authority responsiblefor child education under the new Education Bill.(d) New forms of service, e.g., for general dentistry and care of the eyes, will be considered with the professional and other interests concerned. In the case of dentistry the report of the TeviotCommittee is awaited.6. Organisation in Scotland.(a) The scope and objects of the service will be the same in scotland as in England and Wales, but subject to certain differences due to special circumstances and the geography and existing localgovernment structure in Scotland.(b) The local organisation in Scotland will differ from that inEngland and Wales and will be on the following lines : (i) Regional Hospitals Advisory Councils will be set up foreach of five big regions.    The Councils will be advisory to the
Secretary of State on the co-ordination of the hospital and con-sultant services in each region.(ii) Joint Hospitals Boards will be formed by combination ofneighbouring major local authorities (county councils and towncouncils of large burghs) within the regions to ensure an adequatehospital service in their areas. The Boards will take over allresponsibility for the hospital services of the constituent authorities(including services like the tuberculosis dispensaries, whichessentially belong to the hospital and consultant field) and willalso arrange with voluntary hospitals.(iii) The joint boards will prepare a scheme for the hospital service in their areas and submit this to the Secretary of State,who will consult the Regional Hospital Council before deciding to approve or amend it. The powers of the Secretary of state will be strengthened to enable him to require major local authoritiesto combine for any purpose proved necessary after local enquiry.(iv) Education authorities (county councils and town councils of four cities) will retain responsibility for the school health service and clinics, until the medical treatment part of the schoolservice can be absorbed in the wider health service. Existingmajor health authorities (county councils and town councils oflarge burghs) will normally retain responsibility for the ordinarylocal clinic and similar services ; the necessary co-ordinationwill be secured through their membership of the joint hospital boards and through the Local Medical Services Committee(below).(v) Local Medical Services Committees advisory bodiesconsisting of professional and local authority representatives-will be set up over the same areas as the Joint Hospitals Boards.The Committees will advise the Secretary of State on local administration of the general practitioner service and will provideliaison between the different branches of the Service.7.
