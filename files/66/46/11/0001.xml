NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1.   Allied forces have made a successful landing 30 miles south of Rome.A convoy to jST. Russia has been attacked by U-boats in the Barents Sea.Northern Waters.2. Early on the 26th a convoy to N. Russia was attacked by at least sixU-boats when east of Bear Island. Three ships have been sunk and h.M.S. Obdurate (destroyer) was torpedoed but is proceeding with the convoy.Home Waters.3. On the night of the 20th/21st, two enemy ships, believed to have beendestroyers, passed through the Dover Strait, westbound, at high speed. Coastalforces failed to intercept them but two Albacores claim two possible hits on oneof them when off Le Touquet.   One of the Albacores was shot down.The Dover coastal batteries also opened fire on them and enemy shore batteries replied by shelling Deal.4. On the 21st H.M.S. Kittiwake (corvette) engaged two of a force of fourE-boats, probably engaged in minelaying off Southwold. The E-boats retired at high speed.Mediterranean.5. H.M. ships Orion and Spartan (cruisers) with four destroyers,bombarded enemy positions on the Garigliano River in support of the 5th Armyon the 18th and 19th. Orion fired 1,500 and Spartan 900 rounds. On the night of the 18th/19th Spartan also carried out a diversionary bombardment in theTerracina area,At dawn on the 22nd, Allied troops were successfully landed on a beachfront of several miles in the Anzio area under favourable weather conditions.Some of the beaches were heavily mined. The U.S.S. Brooklyn and H.M. shipsOrion, Spartan, Penelope (cruisers), Allied destroyers and the Dutch gunboatsFlores and Soemba provided gun support. H.M. ships Dido and Ingle field, andthe French Le Fantasque, carried out a diversionary bombardment, and coastalforces made a feint landing in the Civitavecchia area at the same time.Ships commenced unloading at Anzio harbour at 1400/22, where the wrecksare being cleared.On the 22nd, H.M.S. Palomares (fighter direction ship) was mined andproceeded in tow to Naples. The U.S.S. Portent (minesweeper) was also mined and sunk.During an air raid on the 23rd, H.M.S. Janus (destroyer) was torpedoed and sunk and H.M.S. Jervis was damaged by glider bomb.By the 24th, owing to the weather having deteriorated, the northern beacheswere closed, and unloading was taking place at Anzio and on one other beach.During the 24th there was sporadic activity by enemy fighter bombers andat dusk an attack was made with bombs, gliders and torpedoes on shipping offthe beaches. The U.S.S. Plunkett (destroyer) and Prevail (minesweeper) were damaged. Eight enemy aircraft, out of a force of 30, were shot clown, four by ships and four by Beaufighters.On the evening of the 24th, the hospital carriers Leinster, St. Andrew andSi. David were bombed and damaged when about 8 miles off Anzio and fullyilluminated. The St. David (2,702 tons) was sunk : there are 13 missing,including the Master. The U.S.S. Mayo (destroyer) was mined and proceeded to Naples in tow.Discharge through Anzio continued satisfactorily, although bad weathertemporarily prevented unloading over beaches. On the afternoon of the 25th,the weather improved but again deteriorated on the 26th. In spite of these delays,the build-up generally is ahead of schedule. Three auxiliary craft were mined and lost on the 25th..  During this period the Terracina-Formia road has been under continuousbombardment by H.M. cruisers and destroyers and French destroyers.The U.S.S. Brooklyn and the Dutch gunboats Flores and Soemba gavesupport in the assault area.
6. On the night of the 22nd/23rd, three M.G.Bs. intercepted a convoy of six F-lighters escorted by trawlers and E-boats 30 miles south of Leghorn;one E-boat was set on fire and the lighters damaged.Levant.7. H.M. S/M Unruly on patrol in the iEgean sank five caiques and shelledthe lighthouse on Kandeliusa Island (Dodecanese).Black Sea.8. On the night of the 10th/11th the Russians landed in the rear of theenemy on the Kerch Peninsula. This landing was made from light craft of theAzov flotilla and appears to have been successful. Russian shore batteries sank two F-lighters and damaged another in the Dnieper estuary.Pacific.9. On the 19th and 20th, U.S. destroyers bombarded enemy positions on n.E. Bougainville and in Empress Augusta Bay, and sank a gunboat and setfive barges on fire.M.T.Bs. have sunk eight troop-laden barges north of Alexishafen and havealso shelled positions in Empress Augusta Bay.Anti-Submarine Operations.10. During the week 12 attacks on U-boats have been reported, two by shore-based aircraft and the rest by surface craft. U-boats were possibly sunk by H.M.S. Violet (corvette) escorting a southbound convoy in the S.W. Approacheson the 19th, and by a U.S. Catalina and a U.S. Ventura in the Gibraltar andCasablanca areas respectively on the 22nd. On the same day a minesweeperpossibly damaged a U-boat north of the Azores.Enemy Intelligence.11. In the Mediterranean 22 F-lighters are fitting out at La Ciotat andat least 24 barges at Marseilles.At Piraeus the dry docks are in constant use and Siebel ferries and launchesare being built at Salonica.The Lower Danube is now probably closed to navigation by ice.U-boats.12. The main disposition of U-boats in the N. Atlantic appears to be within350 miles of the West of Ireland (R). For the first time in two years a U-boat was sighted in the North Channel.In addition to the U-boats operating in the Barents Sea, there is one in the arabian Sea and some in the Indian Ocean. U-boats have also been sighted inthe western approaches to Gibraltar.Enemy Attack on Shipping.13. In addition to the three ships sunk by U-boats in the convoy to north russia, two ships have been torpedoed in the Arabian Sea.Protection of Seaborne Trade.14. During the week ending the 23rd, 794 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these, 244 were in ocean convoys and 550 in British coastal convoys. Sixty-seven destroyers (including 18 U.S. destroyers) and 114 sloops,cutters, frigates and corvettes were employed on escort duties. Four homeward-bound ocean convoys, consisting of 109 ships, and five outward-bound convoys,of 135 ships, arrived at their destinations without loss.
Allied Minelaying.15. Aircraft laid mines during the week off the Frisian Islands, the dutch coast, the north coast of France and the Biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.16. Minelaying by E-boats is suspected off Lyme Bay on the night of the19th/20th and off the East Coast on the following night. Sixteen moored mines have been destroyed during the week, 14 of which were on the East Coast.The mine totals are : 4,625 ground, 3,971 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.17. During the period 16th to 31st December, 1943, seven enemy ships totalling 24,028 tons were sunk or captured and three ships totalling 10,844 tons were seriously damaged.The German s.s. Scharlachberger (2,844 tons) and the s.s. Baldur (5,000 tons)left Bilbao for Bordeaux on the 24th January. The sailings of the small ships with cargoes of ore continue.The German s.s. Charlotte (ex-French. Catherine Schiaffmo, 1,591 tons)sailed from Istanbul on the 19th for the Black Sea.18. Eight more small craft have passed Istanbul on their way from the black Sea to the ,/aegean. This makes a total of 18 craft varying in size from40 tons to 400 tons, which have made this trip since the beginning of Januaryprobably for the purpose of replacing the losses in ships and caiques in the-aegean. They may be used for minesweeping and convoy duties besides supplying the Islands.Blockade BAinners.19. It is estimated that the five blockade runners which have recentlyattempted to reach Biscay ports from the Far East carried altogetherapproximately 21,000 tons of rubber, 3,000 tons of tin, 800 tons of tungsten andprobably about 1,000 tons of fats, quinine, &amp;c. The most important item for germany is rubber. It is estimated that she requires some 40,000 tons of rubberduring 1944, the basic minimum required being 20,000 tons. It is assumed thatthe s.s. Osorno, the only blockade runner to have reached Bordeaux, carried about,000 tons of rubber, 1,000 tons of tin and 1,000 tons of vegetable oils. It will therefore be seen that Germany, for her 1944 programme, is at present faced witha deficit of between 14,000 and 34,000 tons of rubber.Sweden.20. The exports of Swedish iron ore to Germany for the last quarter of1943 were as follows : From Swedish Ports. From Narvik.Tons.

MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern Sector.21. The Russian offensive which began on the 14th has now made considerable progress. S.W. of Leningrad the Russians have cut the railway toKingisepp, the only east-west line in this area, and S.E. of Leningrad they havealso gained ground. Another Russian thrust north of Lake Ilmen resulted in the capture of Novgorod on the 20th, since when further progress has been madewestwards and south-westwards.( This Russian advance in the northern sector has been made in spite of strongGerman fortifications.Central Sector.22. N.W. of Nevel and, N.W. of Mosyr the Russians have maintained their pressure. On the 23rd they announced a considerable advance S.W. of Mosyr intothe Pripet marshes, probably the result of operations over a week or fortnight.Kiev Sector.23. The Russians have reached the railway Rovno-Shepetovka but for thepast few days no further activity has been reported from the western face of theKiev bulge. The German counter-attacks against the southern flank have continued intermittently and have gained a little ground east of Vinnitsa and north of Uman.Dnieper Bend.24. Apart from some activity in the Kirovograd area, conditions in the dnieper bend have been quiet.Crimea.25. Russian attempts to enlarge their bridgehead at Kerch have apparently-made no substantial progress against determined resistance.General.26. The weather on the eastern front is still unusually mild for the time of year and appears to be impeding operations in various sectors.The Russian successes at Leningrad and Novgorod are particularlynoteworthy as the Germans have had two years in which to dig themselves in.There are no signs that the Germans have withdrawn voluntarily with a view toshortening their line.The Russians have also been able to prevent the German counter-attacks against the Kiev bulge from making any great progress.Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)27. The main event of the week has been the Allied landing at Anzio which took the enemy completely by surprise.Following the successful attack across the southern reaches of the Gariglianoby British troops, French and IJ.S. forces launched an offensive on the 21st inthe direction of Atina and Cassino. On the right the French have made good progress against fierce enemy resistance and are now west of the River Rapidoin the direction of Belmonte. Farther south the U.S. forces, having established a small bridgehead, came up against strong enemy positions and heavy concentra-tions of artillery and mortar fire. After a day&apos;s fighting they were forced towithdraw and the weight of their attack then moved north and was directed onCassino. U.S. forward troops have now established a bridgehead to the north ofthe town.In the coastal sector the enemy has thrown the full weight of his counter-attacks against British positions around Minturno. These attacks have beenheld and heavy casualties have been inflicted on the enemy.28. This offensive successfully drew the Germans&apos; attention to the southand as a result our landing at Anzio was practically unopposed. An allied force sailed from the Naples area under cover of strong naval and air support.Early on the morning of the 22nd the assault went in with U.S. troops on the
right in the Nettuno area and British troops on the left over the beaches 5 miles .W. of Anzio. In spite of difficult beaches two British brigades got ashoresuccessfully and by the afternoon the port of Anzio was in our hands. This porthad been extensively prepared for demolitions but the enemy was not able tocarry these out. With the&apos; port in our hands it was possible to unload heavy equipment and by the evening of the 22nd forward troops were some 4 milesinland and had secured their initial objectives practically unopposed.Since then the bridgehead has been considerably enlarged and U.S. forces on the right are pushing out in the direction of Cisterna and along the CanalMussolini where they are coming up against heavier enemy resistance. On the left British forces are advancing due north towards Campoleone and are alsomeeting heavier opposition. Some 300 prisoners have been taken and enemy gunscaptured.   No definite counter-attack has yet developed.The assault force has gained four valuable days during which to consolidateits positions and to establish a firm base for future operations.Yugoslavia.29. In East Bosnia the Partisans have recaptured two towns N.E. of Tuzla,while fighting is still in progress in Tuzla itself.In West Bosnia confused fighting continues and the Partisans are regainingthe initiative. They have recaptured Jajce and three towns to the S.E. ofthat city.The Partisan garrison was withdrawn from the island of Hvar before itsoccupation by the Germans on the 20th,Greece.30.   Elas repulsed two German columns near Gravia on the 11th.Fighting between Elas and German troops took place north of Metsovonon the l^th and 21st.Burma.31. On both sides of the Mayu Range the Japanese have made a numberof small counter-attacks against our troops S.E. of Maungdaw and north ofButhidaung. All these attacks have failed and our troops have made furtherslight progress.Our troops have made a successful local attack on Japanese positions in thearea Kyaukchaw on the Chindwin, 18 miles S.S.E. of Tamu. In the face of a strong Japanese reaction our forces occupied part of the main enemy positions.New Guinea.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)32.   In the coastal sector there has been patrol activity only.In the Ramu Valley, there has been fighting on a more considerable scale than at any time since October. The Australians have made small advanceson the headwaters of the Faria River (a tributary of the Ramu) and are now established on the watershed between the Faria and the Mintjim, which runsnorthwards to the sea near Bogadjim.   About 130 Japanese have been killed.New Britain.33.   U.S. Marines have made further small advances south-eastwards fromCape Gloucester against strong Japanese resistance.At Arawe, there has been patrol activity only.AIR SITUATION.General Review.35. Aircraft of Bomber Command made heavy night attacks on Berlin andMagdeburg.A raid by 100 enemy aircraft was made on South-Eastern England.In Italy, full air support was provided for the Allied landings in the Anzioarea, and enemy rail centres, roads, and airfields were heavily bombed.In the Pacific, successful attacks were made on enemy shipping.
United Kingdom.36. Jn daylight a total of 11 enemy aircraft made brief landfall over theDartmouth and Falmouth area.On the night of the 21st/22nd a mixed force of 100 aircraft comprisingJu. 88, Ju. 188, He. 177, Do. 217, Me. 410 and F.W. 190, raided south-east Englandand the Home Counties. The attack was made in two phases, the first of whichcommenced at 2040 and consisted of 65 aircraft, 13 penetrating to London. Thesecond phase commenced, at 0419 and consisted of 35 aircraft, of which 14 reachedthe London area. Fighters destroyed eight enemy aircraft with three probablesand two damaged, A.A. destroyed a farther seven and one enemy aircraft was destroyed through unknown causes, bringing the total enemy casualties for the raid to 16 :3 :2. One of the aircraft destroyed was a four-engined bomber,an He. 177.Home Waters.37. Beaufighters of Coastal Command attacked two convoys off theNorwegian Coast, resulting in two ships of 5,500 tons and 3,000 tons and an escort vessel being set on fire, and three ships totalling 9,000&apos; tons and&apos;five escort vessels being damaged.   One Beaufighter is missing.Three Beaufighters attacked some E-boats off Torquay, damaging two.Forty-five aircraft of Bomber Command laid 185 sea mines in enemy waters.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.38. Although offensive operations were again restricted by adverse weather conditions, a total of 1,412 aircraft (including 370 Fortresses and Liberators)attacked military objectives in Northern France on five days of the week, dropping1,969 tons of bombs and firing 825 rocket projectiles with results varying frompoor to good.Small-scale attacks were made on other targets, including six airfields inNorthern France and the Low Countries and steel works and blast furnaces atVelsen in Holland.Fifty-eight Fortresses attacked an industrial plant near Aachen dropping128 tons with poor results.In all these operations, fighters (which flew 4,224 sorties during the week)and bombers destroyed 47 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed eight and damaged17 for the loss of 28 Allied aircraft.Night.39. On the night of the 20th/21st, 679 aircraft, out of 769 despatched,attacked Berlin, dropping 2,401 tons of bombs. There was thick cloud over the target. At first the sky marker flares were slightly scattered, but reports indicatethat as the attack developed a good concentration of bombing was achieved.Towards the end of the attack a large spiral of smoke was seen rising to 25,000 feet.Thirty-five aircraft are missing.On the following night, 647 aircraft were despatched to attack Magdeburg;579 attacked, dropping 2,025 tons. There was some cloud over the target butvisibility was good. Whilst several big explosions and substantial fires were seen in the target area, the attack seemed to be scattered and towards the southof the target. On the same night, 30 aircraft dropped 72 tons on Berlin. Fifty-sixaircraft are missing.On two nights, a total of 170 aircraft bombed military objectives in northern france, on which 733 tons were dropped.Small-scale attacks were made on towns in N.W. Germany and on airfields and other targets in France and the Low Countries by a total of 122 Mosquitoes.Leaflets were dropped on French towns by 70 aircraft, one of which is missing.Italy.40. Air support.and cover was provided for Allied ground forces in theAnzio area and over the battle fronts. Enemy communications were very heavily bombed over a wide area, and enemy airfields were effectively attacked.On the 22nd and for the remainder of the week, fighters flew almost con-tinuous defense patrols over the Anzio beachhead: similar patrols were flown
over the battle areas. An average of about 300 sorties were flown daily onthese defensive patrols. No enemy air opposition was encountered until sixhours after the landings at Nettuno. On the 22nd, 17 enemy fighters were destroyed for the loss of six Allied fighters. On the 24th, Beaufighters destroyedfour long-range bombers (see under &quot; Naval Situation &quot;) and during the following night fighters destroyed a further four enemy bombers.Over -2,600 sorties were flown by light bombers and fighter-bombers inattacks on enemy positions, M.T., guns, tanks, dumps, radar stations, roads,railways and bridges. Some of the heaviest and most effective of these attacks were made in the areas south and south-east of Rome and in the vicinity ofSulmona. A large number of M.T. were either destroyed or damaged and severallocomotives and trains were effectively attacked; at least 12 tanks and a numberof light armoured vehicles were destroyed, and rail tracks and roads were rendered impassable in a number of important localities.About 1,600 sorties were flown by heavy and medium bombers against enemyrail and road communications. Bridges are believed to have been destroyed atCecina, near Carsoli (34 miles N.E. of Rome), Pontecorvo and at Frascati(12 miles S.E. of Rome). Some of the heaviest and most successful attacks weremade in these areas and at term , Velletri (21 miles S.E. of Rome) where the eastand main roads to Rome were cut, Terracina, where a landslide was caused,Avezzano and Ceprano (23 miles N. of Gaeta), the Florence area at Pontassieveand Siena, and north of Leghorn at Pontedera.Over 700 sorties were flown by heavy and medium bombers against enemyairfields. Nearly 500 tons of bombs were dropped on the Rome airfields ofCiampino and Centocelle, the former being rendered temporarily unserviceableand the&apos; latter completely so. The other airfields attacked were at Perugza,Rieti, Viterbo and Guidonia north of Rome, and at Iesi near Ancona.A night attack was made on the torpedo works at Fiume by 43 Wellingtons,the target being well covered. Mitchells obtained hits on two freighters S.E.of Genoa, and made effective attacks on barges, Siebel ferries, two vessels and a number of F-&apos; and E-boats off Leghorn and N.W. of Castiglione.Similar aircraft attacked shipping at Porto Ferrazo (Elba) destroying 9 smallvessels.   Other attacks were made on small shipping by Spitfires and Airacobras.During the week ending dawn on the 25th, the Mediterranean Air Force flew12,000 sorties for the loss of 71 aircraft; enemy casualties for this period were78 destroyed.41. Sixty escorted Fortresses dropped 137 tons of bombs on the railway centre and town of Skoplje. Of 20 enemy fighters encountered, six were destroyed for the loss of one Fortress and two Lightnings. Wellingtons made a nightattack on an aii-craft factory at Maribor (18 miles N. of Zara). Fighter bombersmade effective attacks on enemy shipping; a 1,500-ton ship was sunk and fourhits obtained on another of 5,000 tons; a schooner was sunk and at least sevenothers were set on fire, and a number of other small vessels were damaged.Bulgaria.42. Forty Fortresses, unable to attack the railway centre at Sofia, bombedVrattsa (52 miles N.N.E. of Sofia), where 101 tons were dropped. Fifteen enemy fighters were encountered and eight Fortresses were lost.Greece and ^aegean.43. A total of 23 heavy bombers made two attacks on Piraeus Harbourwhere over 50 tons were dropped. In the iEgean Beaufighters sank severalcaiques and damaged about 15 others; a launch was also hit and a small schoonerAvas left burning.Russia.44. In the early part of the week bad weather prevailed over all fronts and seriously interfered with air operations. Nevertheless the Russian air force hasbeen engaged in close-support operations whenever possible, especially on the leningrad front, and in the area of Vinnitsa and. Kirch.
In the Black Sea an anti-shipping attack was carried out at the beginningof the week, as a result of which the enemy suffered heavy losses.The German air force on the Leningrad front remains singularly weak andthere has been no sign of reinforcement. The enemy appears to have attempted to maintain an effective scale of effort in support of his counter-attacks in theVinnitsa-Kirovograd area, where considerable long-range bomber forces have operated.Burma and Siam.45. Enemy communications were again the principal targets of allied aircraft. Several important railway centres were effectively bombed, includingMandalay, Sagaing, Prome, Meiktila and Bangkok, considerable damage being-caused and many fires started. A bridge in Lower Burma and another nearMandalay were destroyed and at least three others were damaged.Daily attacks were made on shipping on the Irrawaddy and other rivers; alarge number of rivercraft was destroyed or damaged and a steamer was severely damaged.   Off the coast, two small ships and two minelayers were sunk.Among other targets attacked were the Royal Aeronautical Workshops atBangkok, oil installations near Magwe, airfields at Don Muang (Siam) andMyitkyina, and troop concentrations, camps, and factories in different parts ofthe country. Supplies were dropped for Allied troops in Upper Burma and inthe Chin Hills. &apos;Enemy activity was on a comparatively small scale. A formation of about45 enemy fighters was encountered over Maungdaw by 22 Spitfires; six enemy air-craft were destroyed and nine others were probably destroyed for the loss of twoSpitfires.china.46. Successful attacks were made on enemy shipping by Liberators andMitchells. Off the coast, eight ships (including an ammunition ship) were sunk and another ship was damaged. On the rivers, a 400-foot ship was sunk, asecond was probably sunk and a third was damaged.Kittyhawks and Mitchells attacked airfields at Kai Tak near Hong kong and at Nanchang (145 miles S.E. of Hankow). Lightnings destroyed two bridgesnear Canton.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.47. Heavy attacks were made throughout the week by medium and light bombers on enemy targets north of Dumpu, in the Upper Ramu Valley and in theMadang and Hansa Bay areas. Several bridges were destroyed between CapeGourdon and Cape Croisilles (N.W. of Madang). Boram airfield, near Wewak,was twice attacked by escorted Liberators, which dropped 153 tons; fourheavy A.A. batteries were hit and several aircraft destroyed on the ground.During the second attack- 33 intercepting enemy aircraft were destroyed and12 probably destroyed for the loss of five fighters.In attacks on shipping- off the coast, a medium-size ship, a small ship and20 barges were sunk, and a small ship and about 20 barges were seriously damaged.New Ireland and A dmiralty Islands.48. Successful attacks were made on enemy shipping in harbour and off theAdmiralty Islands. A 5,000-ton ammunition ship, three small ships and severalbarges were sunk, a medium-size ship was probably sunk, four small ships were set on fire and three others were damaged.Thirty-six Liberators attacked Borpop airfield. New Ireland, on which84 tons of bombs were dropped with good effect. Mitchells destroyed 15 aircraft on airfields in the Admiralty Islands.New Britain.49. Liberators made four night attacks and escorted Mitchells five dayattacks on airfields near Rabaul,-destroying or damaging several gun positions,
huts and aircraft on the ground. In an attack on Rabaul harbour, 18 escortedAvengers sank six ships (including a tanker) and damaged a further two.Camps and supply dumps near Gasmata and at Cape Hoskins were attacked by escorted Beaufighters which dropped about 70 tons of bombs with good results.Mitchells, Bostons and Thunderbolts attacked targets in the Borgen Bay andRein Bay areas.Enemy aircraft ineffectively bombed Arawe.During these operations heavy losses were inflicted on enemy aircraft whileAllied losses were small.Bougainville.50. Enemy airfields at Kara and Kahili were attacked by light and fighter bombers, which dropped about 40 tons of bombs, obtaining many hits on runwaysand A.A. positions.Two squadrons of Liberators bombed targets in the southern part of the island and Dauntlesses attacked bridges and camps at Empress Augusta Bay.Marshall and Caroline Islands.51. In the Marshalls, air attacks on an increased scale were made on shipping, airfields and other targets. Three ships were sunk, two were probably sunk and four others were damaged. About 25 aircraft were damaged on theground and hits were obtained on barracks, hangars and gun positions.The Japanese replied by occasional light raids on Tarawa and Makin.In the Carolines, 12 Liberators bombed Kusale Harbour. .A rnboina and Timor.52. , Twenty Liberators bombed Halong seaplane base, causing explosionsand fires, and attacked shipping in Ambon Bay. Of about 15 enemy fighterswhich intercepted, five were destroyed and three were damaged for the loss oftwo Liberators.Two Liberators bombed the water-front at Waingapoe on Soemba Island(W. of Timor) causing large fires and probably destroying ten small craft.Beaufighters destroyed three small ships off the west coast of Timor.Kurile Islands (N.E. of Japan).53. On three successive nights a total of 25 Catalinas and Venturasattacked installations on Paramushiro Island.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.54. On the night of the 20th/21st the coast of Kent was shelled. Consider-able blast damage occurred at Deal; there were no serious casualties.On the following night bombs were dropped in South-eastern England andthe London area. The attack was carried out in two phases, from 2040 to 2209and from 0419 to 0545 hours. Many bombs failed to explode and a high propor-tion of LBs. were used. Of a total of approximately 200 incidents, over halfoccurred in Kent; in London there were 44 incidents, the majority being south ofthe river. There was no serious damage and casualties were light. At Dartford,the Bexley Mental Hospital was hit, two wards being destroyed and two badly damaged, there were 13 fatal casualties. At Erith a fire-station and the TownHall were hit and 33 serious casualties occurred. Damage was done to house property at Dover.Casualties.55. The estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hours onthe 26th were 41 killed and 113 seriously injured.

Ground information now enables some slight picture to be given of the severe additional destruction that has been caused since photographic cover,showing the results of attacks up to the 16th- 17th December, was obtained. Upto that date the centre, north-western, western and south-western districts had suffered the major part of the damage. Since then there have been five majorattacks on the nights of the 23rd and 29th December, 1st and 2nd january and 20th January. In the December attacks further damage was caused in thecentre and in the south and south-eastern districts of the city and in particularin Neukoelln. In the first two attacks in January, damage was concentrated inthe eastern and again in the south-eastern parts of the city. In the last attackpreliminary information shows that the eastern and north-eastern parts were most affected. It can now be said that, with the possible exception of the north-eastern outer suburbs, hardly any district of the city has escaped.In these recent raids industrial, business and residential damage has been assevere as in the former attacks. Important works hit include the aircraft andaero-engine repair works in Adlershof, the Rnorr-Bremse Works in Rummelsburg(makers of compressed air brakes of all kinds), the Osram Works, the Auer Works
(electric bulbs and gas masks); the Siemens Works in Lichtenberg (leadingproducers of carbons and electros), and works engaged in the chemical industry.Many of the population who had moved as a result of previous attacks fromthe west to the eastern parts of the city were again bombed out in the first nights of January when the outer eastern districts of Koepenick and Friedrichshafenwere among those that suffered severely.Mannheim / Ludwigshaf en. Ground reports confirm success of the attack bythe U.S.A.A.F. in conditions of 10/10 cloud on the 7th January. The principal features are :  Severe damage in the I.G. Farben Works especially to buildings nearestthe river.Severe damage to the Sulzer Works (Diesel engines);.Damage to rail and water communications. In this category some of the few remaining large warehouses in the harbour area were destroyed togetherwith seventeen barges sunk and more than forty damaged. The railway lines south and to Heidelberg were cut, and damage to the signallinginstallations caused the interruption to traffic to be further prolonged. to repair the damaged tracks labour had to be summoned from other parts ofGermany. The buildings in the station at Ludwigshafen were so damagedas to be useless.Frankfurt. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken after the attack on the 20th/21st December shows that damage, both to business and residential property and to industry, is concentrated mainly in the south-easterndistrict of Offenbach.   Amongst factories severely damaged are : 1Neubecher A.G. (Engineering), Offenbach.Ludwig Becker G.m.b.H. (Engineering), Offenbach.Westdeutsche Bleifarben (Chemicals), Offenbach.Mueller &amp; Kurth (Engineering), Offenbach.Adler Junior (Scrap Metal), E. Frankfurt.Mayfahrt &amp; Co. (Engineers) and Telefon and Normalzeit (Telephones) havebeen moderately damaged.France.Paris. In the attack on the 31st December the C.A.M. ball-bearing works,at Bois Colombes, were so damaged as to cause a complete stoppage in produc-tion. By the 14th January instructions had not yet been given as to whetherrepairs should be effected. The C.A.M. works, at Ivry, were also very severely damaged and it is estimated that production will be held up for several months.Austria.As a result of the attack by Fortresses on the 16th on the Messerschmittaircraft factory at Klagenfurt, no production will be possible for a considerable time.
