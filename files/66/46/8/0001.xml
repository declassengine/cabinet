THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 58.2Qth January, 1944WAR CABINET.ROYAL AIR FORCE  ESTABLISHMENTS.Memorandum by the Deputy Prime Minister.I circulate, for the information of the War Cabinet, a copy of the Reportof the Committee appointed to examine the Establishments of the Royal AirForce.C. R. A.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,2Qth January, 1944.Report of Committee appointed to examine the Establishments of theRoyal Air Force.1. At the discussions of the War Cabinet on man-power on the 16th andthe 22nd July, 1943 (W.M. (43) 100th Conclusions, Minute 2 and W.M. (43)102nd Conclusions, Minute 1), a suggestion was considered that there shouldbe an enquiry into the personnel of the Royal Air Force to see whether theproportion&apos; of Ground Staffs to Air Crews could be further reduced.Subsequently we were appointed as a Committee to undertake this enquiry.2. The most striking fact that emerged from our examination, and one that we therefore put in the forefront of this report, is that the Air Crewpersonnel represent only 2 - 95 per cent, of the Royal Air Force in this country,though it should be noted that Commands at Home also serve overseas theatres.Air Crew Establishments.3. Before comparing the numbers of ground personnel with those of aircrews we studied the air crew establishments themselves, because anyextravagance in trained air crews would point to far greater waste of man-power throughout the Service. At the 1st July, 1943, the excess of crews allowedover initial equipment and immediate reserve of aircraft was : Bomber Com-mand 13-5 per cent., Fighter Command 21-3 per cent., Coastal Command17-2 per cent., Tactical Air Force 22-5 per cent. These margins of crewsover aircraft provide the only reserves held by Commands to&apos; make allowance for casualties and personnel temporarily non-effective for various reasons.Air Crew Training.4. Wastage in the course of air crew training, which extends commonlyover periods as long as eighteen months, is high. We are satisfied, however,that the causes of wastage are carefully sought out and that every attempt ismade to eliminate them. If at any stage of air crew training a candidate seemsunsuitable for flying duties, he is transferred at once to other employment. TheAir Ministry provided an analysis showing the training history of 1,000 aircrew cadets selected at random from Air Crew Receiving Centres. Out of the134 failures in this sample only 20 occurred at the most advanced (i.e., the operational Training Unit) stage. Improved selection methods have savedsubstantial time in training. For example, the introduction of the &quot; grading&quot;system has reduced failures at the Elementary Flying Training School for Pilotsfrom some 35 per cent, to 10 per cent.[26797]Copy No.
Disposal of Air Crew Personnel.5. We sought explanation of the fact that against a Home establishment of under 5,000 crews .(some of which have two pilots) the output of pilots fromOperational Training Units in this country was over 11,000 in the year endedJune 1943. Apart from demands for overseas reinforcements and replacement of casulties, the heaviest claim on this output was for replacement of crews who had completed their operational duties and become instructors. We examined thescheme of operational tours, which vary in length in the different Commands, andwere assured that the number of air crews coming off operational duties is insufficient to meet present requirements for instructors.&apos; The time can perhapsnow be foreseen when it will be possible to meet these requirements in full.While no doubt there are positions which could advantageously be filled bypersonnel with operational experience, care should be taken not to waste insedentary occupations fully-trained flying personnel which.might be used in amore active way.Ground Servicing Personnel.6. Examining the proportion of ground staffs to air crews, we were at oncefaced with the strikingly high cost in man-power of training and maintainingan extremely specialised operational force and the very great ground force needed to service highly complicated modern aircraft. As is clearly essential, establish-ments of ground personnel are kept under constant review and are adapted tochanging circumstances and commitments, We analysed in their totality and byfunctions the establishments of the Home Commands. For this purpose numberswere provided of personnel employed under training, on instruction, maintenance,equipment, signals, accounts, messing, medical duties, ground transport, marinecraft, flying control, balloons, experimental work, station services, administrativeduties, and as Air Staff, Command and Group Staffs, and air crews. We thoughtit a waste of time to compare the percentages allotted to the various functionswithin the Royal Air Force with those employed in the other Fighting Services orin Industry.7. Over 25 per cent, of the strength of the Royal Air Force in this countryis made up of personnel employed on duties concerned with servicing and repair of aircraft, airborne equipment, and ground equipment related thereto(i.e., excluding Mechanical Transport, balloons, ground armament and signalsequipment, clothing stores, &amp;c). As one line of enquiry, we ascertained thenumbers of man-hours per month required to keep in serviceable condition thevarious types of aircraft in use in the Royal Air Force. The figures are high :that for a heavy bomber is 3,070 man-hours per month. Since official working-hours for ground servicing personnel give an average of 192 net technicalworking hours per man per month, the man-hours spent on servicing and repairing a.heavy bomber represent the continuous working time of fifteen men.We were assured that this merely reflects the intense complexity of the equipment of modern aircraft. Without extensive inspection on the ground, a committeesuch as ours could not ascertain for itself that there is no room for furthereconomy in the use of ground personnel in the Royal Air Force, We made onevisit, to the Fighter Command Station at Biggin Hill, where we inspected theoperations room, the airfield, the workshops, &amp;c. Considering the economy measures already taken, wc decided that no further reduction of personnel atthis station should be recommended at present.Common Services.8. The proportion of ground personnel to fighting men in the Royal AirForce is swollen by considerable numbers employed on common defence^ services rendered by the Royal Air Force on behalf of the American Air Force in thiscountry and the Fleet Air Arm. Examples of such services are R.D.F. groundunits, the Air-Sea Rescue Service, various signals, communication and tele-printer services, including the &quot; Y &quot; services, Concealment and Decoy, and RadioCounter-measures. In addition, there are various services which cannot readily,be related to first-line strength, e.g., the R.A.F. Regiment, the Balloon Defence,and established posts filled by Royal Air Force personnel in. units under thetechnical control of the Ministry of Aircraft Production. Of these last, thelargest numbers are in Repair and Salvage Units (&quot;43 Group &quot;) and AircraftStorage Units (&quot; 41 Group &quot;). The number of personnel employed in all these services approaches a quarter of a million.
Personnel Under Training.10. Reverting to our analysis by functions of the establishments of theRoyal Air Force at Home, we had one serious point to make. 206,991 men andwomen were shown as under training at the end of November 1943, out of a totalof 822,195 personnel, made up as follows : Bomber Command 158,693, fighter command 100,471, Coastal Command 70,945, Tactical Air Force 33,948, flying training Command 145,561, Technical Training Command 174,706, BalloonCommand 32,965, Maintenance Command 104,906. Bearing in mind the lowcasualty rate amongst Royal Air Force ground personnel, the numbers of traineesoverseas, and the latest man-power allocation to the Service, we considered thaton the basis of a policy of maximum impact on the enemy in 1944 the numbersunder training were much too large. They represented a full-scale insurance for continuous maximum war effort. We should have recommended a substantialcut in these numbers, but for the fact that they were decided upon some time ago,before the recent War Cabinet decisions on the use of Royal Air Force man-power (W.M. (43) 164th Conclusions). As a result of these decisions the RoyalAir Force is increasing its squadrons by some 12 per cent, without additionalman-power (except for an allocation of women in the second half of this year) by taking men from training without replacing them.Conclusion.11. Much has been done in the period of our enquiry and is still being doneby the Air Ministry to make economical use of existing man-power in the RoyalAir Force. While we cannot point to any wasteful use on major functions withinthe Service, we nevertheless consider that throughout such a large and variedorganisation the limit of possible economy is unlikely in practice to be reached.If the general man-power situation demands further savings, we believe that theAir Ministry alone can decide where they can be made with the least danger tooperational efficiency. The training organisation will now steadily contractbecause of the greatly reduced numbers to be trained for ground and flyingduties. We are satisfied that, at the present time, no greater sacrifice should becalled for than is required by the decision to provide personnel .for additionalsquadrons from man-power already in the Service..    .. .C.

We question the justification under present conditions for the R.A.F.Regiment, and examined the strength, purpose and location of its units. In thepast twelve months the strength of the Regiment has been several times cut, andits organisation has been completely re-cast. Before the start of our enquirythe number of personnel had already been reduced from some 80,000 to 60,000.The establishment is now being further reduced to some 50,000, of which 39,000will form the establishment at Home. Airfields in the United Kingdom account for 22,000. The remainder of the Home establishment is allotted to the tactical air Force (for forthcoming overseas operations), the defence of schools, depots,vulnerable points, &amp;c. Under the planned disposition the Regiment at Homewill be scattered in small groups over airfields liable to enemy attack and othervulnerable points mainly within a belt of from ten to twenty miles from, the coast.Except at four especially vulnerable night-fighter stations and certain A.M.E.stations where the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, has desired a whole-timeground-defence garrison to be employed, the personnel of the Regiment in theUnited Kingdom is employed exclusively on anti-aircraft duties. The numbersallocated to stations are sufficient only to man the anti-aircraft guns.Supplementary anti-aircraft defence by machine-guns is left to the ordinaryground staff of the station. In the view of the Air Ministry there is no reasonto believe that these defence measures can safely be withdrawn. Thus the R.A.F.Regiment may be regarded as a form of insurance. So far as we have been ableto judge the reduced premium now being paid is not excessive. We do not recommend that the risk should be taken &apos;&apos; uncovered.&apos;&apos;
