These conversations covered, a wide field. There were first of all discussions on currency questions, and our delegation was instructed to secure, as far as possible, the essentials of the Clearing Union.In this they were remarkably successful and I consider that the agreed statement on Currency does embody, even though it is dressed up in American terminology,the main features of our own plan. Anything less like a Gold Standard can scarcely be conceived. It provides for changes in exchange rates wdien a country&apos;balance of payments makes this necessary, for a substantial provision of creditfrom the United. States and other creditor countries, and an international organof consultation and adjustment not predominantly under American auspices.There were discussions on Commercial Policy. After very lengthy delibera-tions by Ministers and Officials alike the Cabinet agreed, last summer, that our interests would best be served by a breaking down of trade barriers of all kindsand by the widest possible degree of multilateral trade. The Delegationaccordingly proceeded to Washington with an Aide-memoire and an Outline of proposals, approved by the Cabinet, which were handed to the Americans at the outset, and which were the basis of discussion. Here, too, there was a wide measure of agreement. The points of difference, upon which a decision will nowbe required, and the safeguards upon which we must insist, will be found in annex B of this paper.Commodity Policy formed a third topic. Here again our delegates wereremarkably successful in achieving ageement with the American officials on a set of principles in full accord with our own ideas. These include, in accordancewith the Cabinet decisions of last summer, the institution of a Commodity Policy[26868] . fc b
organisation, the application of the Buffer Stock technique where that is prac-ticable, and the use of quantitative restrictions of production or export of primary products only as a temporary measure where there is a severe maladjustmentbetween supply and demand and with proper safeguards for the interests of consumers and efficient producers.On the initiative of the Americans there was also a very preliminary exchangeof views upon Cartel Policy and Employment Policy. The Americans also handed to our Delegation the first draft of an International Investment Bank.The War Cabinet have already approved the general line of policy whichunderlies the Washington Conversations. I had hoped, therefore, that I shouldbe able to confine myself in this paper to an examination of the extent to whichthe principles which were agreed at Washington conformed to Cabinet policy;and to focussing the issues upon which further decisions of policy, are requiredin the light of the Washington talks and of the forthcoming conversations withthe Dominions.It is clear, however, that some of my colleagues wish to re-examine the wholepolicy outlined in Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement, which theWar Cabinet has already approved and which was the basis of the talks in washington last September. It seems necessary, therefore, for the War Cabinetto come now to a final decision on this matter. For if it is decided to reverse the present policy, it will be necessary so to inform the Dominions and the americans.I should, perhaps, add that we are not trying to agree in detail the terms ofa treaty with the United States Government. We are seeking to formulate withthem a set of principles which we can jointly try out on third parties, and whichcan be transformed into international instruments to be brought into force onlygradually and over a relatively long period of years.I.- The Extent of our Commitment;The Mutual Aid Agreement was signed in February 1942. Its signaturewas attended by many doubts and hesitations. And it was only after the mostsearching debate, and after the deployment of , all the arguments which haverecently been advanced by the Secretary of State for India and the Minister for agriculture and Fisheries, that we agreed to sign.&quot; It may have been necessary,&quot; says the Secretary of State for India, &quot; for political reasons to agree to Article VII.&quot; But the thesis that the Mutual aid agreement was no more than a political gesture does not bear examination. Itwas not an exercise in American appeasement, nor a surrender to Americanblackmail. No doubt a consideration which powerfully influenced the cabinets decision was the underlying conviction that we must march with the americans in the economic as in the political field. But the basis of our signature of the mutual Aid Agreement was the belief that the policies indicated in Article VIIoffered, the most hopeful prospect of a solution of the very serious problems with which we ourselves will be faced after the war.More than that. The three projects upon which the Washington talks were mainly centred were not American proposals to which we were being pressed toa reluctant assent. They were British projects which we, for our own purposes,were pressing upon the &quot;Americans. And we were pressing them because it became clear, as the result of prolonged and massive consideration bothdepartmentally and in Cabinet, that the balance of advantage for us not forthe Americans or the Chinese lay with these proposals rather than with any alternative,All the disadvantages which must attend the signature of the Mutual aid agreement were canvassed at the time. It was pointed out that Article VIIinvolved some limitation upon our absolute freedom of action, and that itimpinged upon the whole system of Imperial Preference. The Cabinet decidedthat the advantages outweighed the disadvantages. The Mutual Aid agreement was signed. We were henceforth committed to pursue, in co-operation with the americans and other like-minded nations, a policy of expansionism and theremoval of impediments to trade. It is not open to us, therefore,,to adopt now a policy which is based upon discriminatory protectionism and the unrestrictedquantitative limitation of imports.We are committed to Article VII. Neither we nor the Americans are committed in any way to the results of the Washington Conversations.   That was
clear from the start. And if we should decide, after due consideration, that thegulf between us is so wide that it is useless to pursue any further this particularline of approach we should be perfectly free to inform the Americans of our decision. We would not, of course, be free to modify our general approach, for we should still be bound by Article VII.But we ought, I think, to be careful of how we exercise this freedom. If the americans had met us, while we were in Washington, on every one of the points in our instructions, we would still be &apos;&apos; free &apos;&apos; to retrace our steps so long aswe were prepared to advance again. We would not be dishonourable if we wereto overthrow our own policy. We would only look heroically silly. There must obviously be a limit, imposed by considerations not of honour but of common-sense, to the non-committal character of non-committal conversations. as sir Kingsley Wood pointed out in W.P. (43) 383 : &quot; We cannot regard these discussions as an academic exercise.....   If our delegation reach agreement on principles with the Americans which they can recommend to us to approveprovisionally for further consideration at the drafting committee, we shall bebaking the first step in a course which would lead probably to the formulation ofan agreed and detailed international scheme. This appears to me a logical andinevitable step; if we mean anything by economic co-operation with the UnitedStates, we must at some stage descend from generalities or pious resolutions to more exact or difficult plans.&quot;The issue is, therefore, whether we have in fact reached the limits of thenon-committal and whether or not the time has come to &quot;descend fromgeneralities and pious resolutions to more exact and difficult plans.&quot;II.The American Attitude towards Article VII.The Americans, too, are uncommitted by the Washington Conversations.To what extent are they committed by Article VII % Is it not possible that weare tying our hands while the Americans, behind the enviable barrier of their constitution, retain absolute freedom of action &apos;\Anything, no doubt, is possible under the American Constitution. Certainlyit is possible that a future Congress may repudiate the Mutual Aid Agreement.One can never be sure, of any country, that a Government will not wriggle outof engagements contracted by its predecessors. But what then? In freeingthemselves Congress would be freeing us. Even the Constitution of the UnitedStates cannot free one party to an international agreement while binding theother. And certainly we cannot get out of a solemn engagement only because there is a chance that the other party may get out of it at some -future date.That is a reason for refusing to enter into an agreement, not for getting outof one.In one sense, it is true, Article VII is more binding upon us than upon the americans; there is a distinction between Article VII and the rest of the mutual aid Agreement. Under the Lend-Lease Act the President is given irrevocableauthority to determine the benefits which the United States shall receive in -return for Lend-Lease. Article VII, however, deals among other things with&quot; the betterment of world-wide economic relations,&quot; and it has been argued thatthis is outside the mandate which has been given to the President by the Act.In strict constitutional theory, therefore, the first six articles of the mutual aid Agreement are irrevocable, but Article VII can be held to be ultra vires ofthe President and therefore revocable by Congress.Even so, there is one passage in Article VII which appears to beconstitutionally binding upon the United States, the passage which states thatthe terms and conditions for the repayment of Lend-Lease &quot;shall be such as not to burden commerce between the two countries.&quot; And it is exceedingly toour advantage that this should be so, for this part of the Mutual Aid agreement is going to be our sheet anchor when we come to the final settlement of Lend-Lease.The position so far as the more general parts of Article VII are concernedseems to be this. The declarations about the expansion of trade, the elimination of discrimination, the reduction of trade barriers and so on, are something thatthe President required from us as an inducement to him to give us the advantageof the other parts of the agreement. These declarations are binding on us andon him but not, in the same degree, upon Congress. Congress, for its part, has.[26868] B 2
an option and it has not yet determined whether, or in what form, it will exerciseit. We cannot withdraw this option. But Congress is not compelled to exerciseit. Of course, if it does not exercise it, we, on our side, are equally released.But until we are released we are bound by Article VII. We must face the factthat the Americans have an option, as it were, upon sanity. Until they go mad,we for our part are under an obligation to remain sane.There is nothing very damaging to our interests in. all this. We get theinvaluable advantage of terms of settlement which &quot;will not burden commerce.&quot;In addition, we have the possibility to put it no higher that the United states will pursue an economic policy which is very much in our interests. I do notthink, therefore, that there is much force in the argument that we are boundwhile the Americans remain free. According to the strictest interpretation of constitutional theory we are more deeply committed than they to Article VII.But nothing would be gained if we tried to equalise matters by running out ofour part of the bargain.  And a very great deal would be lost.It is said that it may be very dangerous to negotiate on matters so contentiousduring the Presidential year. It will certainly be impossible, it is argued, toreach an agreement during the election campaign; the effort to agree will createmisunderstandings of a kind very damaging to the whole nexus of Anglo-American relations; would it not be more prudent, therefore, to put the wholequestion into cold storage until this dangerous period is over ? In any case, it maybe said, it is likely that the present Administration will be succeeded by a republican Administration allergic to the principles of internationalism whichare implicit in Article VII; would it not be wiser, therefore, to await the resultof the Presidential election before we commit ourselves irrevocably to anyparticular policy ?There is obviously some force in these arguments, but I do not think thatthey are conclusive. In American eyes it would seem to be an attempt to slipout of a commitment. And the underlying motive would not be hidden, for itwould be obvious&apos; that we had drawn back because we were beginning to discounta Republican victory in November. This would not endear us to the Administra-tion. Nor, I fancy, would it placate their opponents, who are likely to remainunimpressed, by such an exercise in appeasement.In any case it would be a mistake to base our policy upon the firm assumptionthat a Republican administration would be opposed, in all circumstances, to international co-operation in the economic field. The presumption is that the republicans are economic isolationists. But it would, I think, be a mistake towager very heavily on it. Such evidence as I have seen is scanty, but it is in thecontrary sense. We have heard from Washington that the State Department havealready disclosed to influential manufacturing associations the more contentiousparts of the commercial policy that was agreed in Washington. The disclosurewas well received, and the manufacturers, it is said, have become proselytes.Some days ago. I was talking myself to Sir Alan Anderson andMr. Arthur Guinness, who have recently returned from a tour of the UnitedStates. They told me that the American industrialist was far more consciousthan they had supposed of the straits in which he Avould find himself if the undulyfavourable balance of payments of the United States was not adjusted by someexpedient or other. Sir Alan and Mr. Guinness were firm in their conviction, itis true, that neither a drastic reduction in the tariff nor a Stabilisation fund would be acceptable in the present state of opinion in the United States. It was clear, nevertheless, that opinion in Republican, industrial circles was crystallisingin this direction; something, disagreeable in greater or less degree, would haveto be done to save the United States from the consequences of overwhelming-economic supremacy.It is a fact which we should be unwise, in my opinion, to ignore, that theAmerican industrialist is nobody&apos;s fool, and that he looks as far ahead as most people. He has not forgotten that there were twelve or fifteen million unemployed in America during the depression, that this figure possesses no particular sanctityand may well be exceeded after the war, and that the social structure of theUnited States is not so strong that it can bear unlimited strains of this kind.There is this further consideration. The Americans must be at least asconscious as we are of the difficulties of the Presidential election. It is a factthat the Administration are pressing us to continue the WashingtonConversations. Are we wise if we refuse on account of domestic factors, not inthis country, but in the United States ?I conclude, therefore, that it would be a mistake for us to desist from thepolicy Upon which we have agreed because of the American elections.   It would
177give the appearance of deserting our friends: in an effort to placate those whom we thought to be less friendly.   It is by no means clear that appeasement of this;kind would be well directed.  Finally, the Administration itself does not seem to&apos;share our qualms. :III.The Washington Conversations and British Interests.I have already said that the principle projects discussed at Washingtonwere British projects, put forward by us and for our advantage.    It may berconvenient if I develop the argument here.We can all agree that the greatest economic task which will face usinternationally will be to restore our balance of international payments, whichthe war will have thrown seriously out of joint. We must certainly not accept any obligations inconsistent with our determination to provide Food, Workand Homes for 47 million people in these islands. But for this policy weshall need not only wise arrangements at home, but a steady volume of essential imports of food-stuffs and raw materials. Where are we to find the markets for the exports by which alone&apos; we shall be able to pay for these essential imports ?There is a characteristic of our trading position which has a vital bearingupon our future economic policy. It is. this. The manufactured goods whichwe export are less essential to our customers than the food and raw materials which they export to us; and our exports to them have to be sold, to an increasing extent, in competition with their own manufactures. From this it follows thatit is more important to us to be able to prevent our customers from imposingrestrictions upon our exports than to have freedom to protect ourselvesagainst imports from them. If we insist upon absolute freedom to limitimports other countries will take the same freedom to limit their imports. and because we cannot do without their exports while they can do without ours ourbargaining position is likely to be a weak one. In the long run our customerswould become increasingly self-sufficient while we remained dependent, andwe could look forward only to ever diminishing standards of life.Moreover, the plain, blunt and disagreeable truth must be faced that thereis no mechanical device by which we can ensure that the rest of the world will maintain the population of these islands at a standard of life higher than thatto which it is entitled by its economic activity. No amount of wishful thinking1or of Hegelian dialectic will soften the harshness of this formidable truth. Thesolution of the problem with which we are faced must depend, therefore, uponthe energy, the ingenuity and the technical skill and experience of the british people. One other thing we must do. We must ensure, as far as we can, that,these qualities have full scope in the post-war world and that the advantages which we possess in the innate qualities of our people should not be lost throughthe imposition of trade barriers, import restrictions and the like against british exports.There is also another characteristic of our trade position which it is necessaryto bear in mind in considering the Washington Conversations. We do not sellin the same markets from which we buy. From the point of view of our futuretrade prospects, therefore, it is important that there is machinery for multi-,lateral clearing, so that our purchases in one part of the world can be offset by our sales in another. The only alternative to something like the StabilisationFund or the Clearing Union is a system of currency blocs and bilateral tradingarrangements through which purchases and sales would be balanced with each individual country or group.There are political arguments, to which I will refer later and which seemto me to be, decisive, against our adopting such a system of bilateral trading.But superficially it is attractive. It is easily understood. It is neat and tidy.It has a specious appearance of fair-mindedness and fair play; after all, why should we buy so much from the Argentine when the dirty Argentino buys so little from us? But it has very great disadvantages. It means that we force,our export trade into a straight-jacket. Instead of producing those things forwhich they have a special aptitude, and in the production of which they have a competitive advantage, our manufacturers are forced to take up other lines forwhich they have less special aptitude and in which they have less competitiveadvantage.Moreover; if we adopt the bilateral solution we cannot hope to reach any agreement limiting the protective barriers that other countries may erect against
our exports. As time goes on, our customers will throw off their dependence upon us which our bilateral bargains will have emphasised, and will adopt a protectivepolicy for the excessive and uneconomic industrialisation of their countries. Wemay then see the sources of. our essential supplies of raw materials and food-stuffsdrying up sources which we can best hope to maintain by a reasonable policyoutlawing immoderate protectionism all round.The multilateral solution will, of course, impose certain restrictions on our freedom of action. First, there would be limitations on the degree to which,and the methods by which, we could protect particular industries in this country.This limitation of our freedom involves real problems, and I will touch upon them at a later stage in this paper.Secondly, we cannot hope to make substantial progress on these lines withouta substantial modification of Imperial Preferences. The more extreme advocates of Imperial Preferences may regard this as little less than disastrous, but theypush their arguments too far. Thanks to Preferences, it is said &quot; The Empirehas in recent years taken half of our manufactured exports &quot; (W.P. (43) 388).And again there is talk of &quot; those Empire Preferences with the help of whichpractically half of our gross total exports have in recent years gone to theEmpire .... it would be safe to say that the Empire trade was worth a greatdeal more to us than the trade of the rest of the world put together. How can we hope to retain the preferences upon which that trade is so largely based unless we give preferences in return?&quot; (W.P. (43) 576)..In one sense, of course, it can be said that it is thanks to Imperial Preferencethat the Empire takes half of our manufactured exports; for before the ottawa agreements the countries of the Empire absorbed not 50 but 45 per cent, of our export trade. In any other sense than this, however, the economic consequences of Imperial Preference must be admitted to be less satisfactory. For our exportsto Empire markets fell from  324 million in 1929 to  235 million in 1938.It is true that our exports to countries outside of the Empire were contractedeven more savagely ( 405 million in 1929 as against  236 million in 1938). Butthe fact that our exports to the Empire did not fall quite so seriously as our exports to other countries can hardly be taken to prpye that Preferences carry with them the solution of our balance of payments problem. A fall in the total value of our export trade from  729 million to  471 million (and a change froma favourable balance of payments of  103 million in 1929 to an unfavourablebalance of  55 million in 1938) is to be explained by the very great increase inthe barriers of every kind which were raised against them in the markets of theworld. It was not only that the advantages of the Ottawa Agreements wereoffset by the high tariffs and. import restrictions, some of them retaliatory intheir nature, which were imposed against us in world markets. The very realadvantage which we derived from the exchange depreciation in 1931 was partlylost when other countries, such as the United States, depreciated their exchangesagainst us in unnecessary retaliation.From the point of view of the long-term prospects of our balance of payments the ideal arrangement would be one which permitted us to impose such restric-tions as we thought necessary and denied the same right to other countries. Itis obvious that such an ideal cannot be realised, but the policy which was agreed at Washington goes very near to -it. It gives us, to quite a remarkable extent, thebest of both worlds.For it is of the essence of the Agreed Statements on Currency and commercial policy that a country with an unfavourable balance of payments is permitted touse expedients which are denied to a country with a favourable balance. In other words, we shall be allowed greater facilities if our balance of payments isunfavourable to depreciate sterling than are allowed to the United States, forexample, while it has a favourable balance of payments. In the same way weshall be allowed a tight control of our imports, if our balance is unfavourable,while countries with a favourable balance are denied the use of the sameexpedients. Moreover, a country whose balance of payments is so favourablethat its currency becomes &quot;scarce&quot; will have to face the prospect of discriminatory restrictions against its goods without the right to. retaliatein kind.It is important to consider whether the freedom of action which we enjoyunder these proposals is sufficient for our purposes. A number of my colleagues are concerned, very properly, to ensure that we are not so tightly bound up witha world system that we are debarred from pursuing in the domestic field policies of expansionism and full employment, irrespective of. what world conditionsmay be.   It must be admitted that in 1931, at a. moment of unparalleled
disequilibrium and depression, we were&quot; free&apos; -to adopt a&apos; numner of expedients-tariffs, preferential arrangements with the- Empire, quotia; restrictions andcurrency depreciation-which enabled&apos;us^ to weather the storm as we Could nothave done if our hands had not been free.But the absolute freedom which we enjoyed before0 the wari was largelyillusory, because every other country had precisely the same freedom1 and usedit in precisely the same Way. Our exchange depreciation was offset by theunnecessary American exchange depreciation; the&apos; inexcusable Hawley-Smoottariff of the Americans preceded our Ottawa agreements; and our tariff wascounterbalanced by a proliferation of trade barriers in our overseas markets.Our freedom to manage our own affairs might have been more real in fact if ithad been more limited in theory and if we had- been able, in return for somesacrifice of our own liberty of action, to ensure that other countries did1 not-abusetheirs: If We adopt the policies which our delegation were discussing atWashington we shall certainly lose some of our freedom to protect particular industries and occupations in this country. But we shall&quot;gain immensely in our freedom to accept imports and to pay for them with exports. While we retainconsiderable latitude in the management of our own exchange rates, we areprotected from a competitive siege of exchange depreciation, and we are assured of some stability in exchanges and of a multilateral clearing system-which-willgreatly facilitate our export policy. And while we retain the right to imposequantitative restrictions upon our imports when our balance of payments isunfavourable, we ensure that countries with a favourable balance cannot imposesimilar restrictions against our exports. At the same time we may well gain far more than we lose from an all-round reduction in tariffs. Generally speaking, thelevel of our own tariffs is lower than that of the tariffs over which Britain exports have to climb in foreign markets. Our officials insisted at Washington that anytariff proposal which we could accept must involve a more radical cut in highthan in low tariffs/IV.The Period of Transition.Regarded as a long-term objective the policy of Article VII and theWashington Conversations is clearly in our interests. It gives us as much liberty of action as we can hope for in an imperfect world, and it protects us, in verygreat measure, from the abuse by others of the freedom which they enjoy. Butit would be ridiculous to maintain that this policy will give us all that we want,or all that we shall need, in the immediate post-war period. Special arrangements will have to be made to cover the transitional period. And we may be well advised,when we resume our discussions with the Americans, to concentrate morethoroughly than we have so far done upon the economics of the transition. It is certain that we shall require during this period a greater measure of freedom(and assistance) than we shall be allowed under the long-term arrangements whichwe are contemplating,Some of my colleagues, I know, argue that we should concentrate exclusivelyupon the transitional period and leave the long-term problem to take care of itself.That, after all,&apos; is &apos; our policy at home. What&apos;reason is there for adopting adifferent attitude in our external economic relationships1? There are very good reasons. In the first place we are going to need a measure of assistance from theUnited States if we are to surmount our immediate post-war problems. We shallhave to get that assistance on terms which will not involve a repetition of thedifficulties of the debt situation after the last war. This is a problem which itis going to be difficult for us to solve in any case. But a solution becomesimpossible if We start off with an alignment of policy which runs directly counter to the American view of international economic relationships. We are entitledto argue, if we like, that our view is as good as theirs and that it is only, chicken-livered pusillanimity to consider American suspectibiiities to this extent. But wecannot expect that such a line of argument will do very much to persuade the americans to meet us in our special difficulties.*That is not all. We have to1 consider the economic position of the world asa whole. Our own position is not unique. We are not the only people who will need a - special i latitude in the immediate post-war period. Others, besidesourselves, will be faced with acute problems of industrial demobilisation. Otherswill be looking for full-employment policies. Others will be protecting their own industries and seeking by subsidies, two-price systems and the: like to expand
their exports. Unless, therefore, we take special measures to guard against it,the conditions of the transition will become normal and permanent. If we decide that a system of ordered multilateral trading will suit us best in the long run, wemust see to it that the expedients which we and others are driven to adopt duringthe transition are directed towards this long-term goal and, as far as may bepossible, made to conform to it. Dispensations there will haye to be, but it isessential that they be granted by agreement among the Bishops and in accordancewith the rules of the Church.   Otherwise the sin will prove mortal.Moreover, the transitional arrangements which other countries may adoptto restore their economies may accentuate, in some cases unnecessarily, thedifficulties of our own transitional adjustments. Serious undervaluation of thecurrencies of our competitors or import restrictions, unnecessarily prolonged, orunnecessarily severe, in our export markets, would increase our difficulties.While, therefore, we require special freedom of action in the transitional period,we are equally interested in achieving a moderate use of these freedoms and theirtermination at as early a date as is reasonable.There is yet a further reason why we cannot apply to our external arrange-ments for post-war reconstruction the principle which we have chosen to applyto our internal reconstruction, namely, to concentrate on the transitional arrangements. We can make our own discussion of our domestic arrangementswait upon our own political convenience. But we cannot make the discussionof long-term economic arrangements by the Americans, the Russians, the Chinese,the French, the Dutch and the rest of the world wait upon our internal con-venience. We must be prepared to discuss long-run external arrangements whenothers are prepared to discuss them; and if we miss the psychological opportunityoffered to us now, it may never recur.Our transitional arrangements should, therefore, be based upon the following considerations. We must lay great stress on their importance and must startto consider them in greater detail when we next meet the Americans; we mustretain&quot; sufficient freedom of action to make sure that we can restore our position;we must ensure that the full obligations of the long-term settlement do not comeinto operation before we (and other countries) will be in a position to fulfil them;we must, however, take what steps we can to ensure that the special freedomsof the transitional period are not abused and are not unnecessarily prolonged;and we must not allow these transitional difficulties to stand in the way of reaching agreement now on the longer-term arrangements. General suggestions of the way in which these principles might be applied to the transitional arrangements for monetary and commercial policy are outlined in more detail in the Annexes A and B.I can see some force in the argument, which has been put forward withespecial reference to Agriculture, that a transitional policy which is notavowedly permanent is no policy at all. Agriculture, it is agreed, is a long-termbusiness and the farmer is not interested in the quick return. To give him, forexample, an assured market in wheat up to a certain figure, in order to meet a particular crisis, and remove the assurance when the crisis has been met(partly as a result of his own efforts) is not practical politics. At any rate, itis not practical economics.But we must not force this argument too far. We do not apply it to theemergency production of aircraft or munitions. We do not maintain that it is impracticable politically or economically to demand of the aircraft industry a. vastly increased effort so long as our very being depends upon it, unless weare willing permanently to assure the industry of almost unlimited protection.Munitions production and food production are both essential to us in anemergency; and we may properly decide, even after the transition from theemergency is over, to give them special help and consideration. But in neithercase is it essential to prolong emergency or transitional arrangements indefinitelywithout modification.My colleagues will find in Annex B (paragraph 16) examples of thekind of latitude which will be allowed in the long run to the agricultural industry under the Washington proposals. Quantitative restrictions will notbe permissible as a long-term measure; but moderate tariff protection andsubsidisation* will be allowed.   Guaranteed prices could still be offered to home* Whether or not any limit at all wiJl be placed upon the subsidisation of agriculture is stilla matter of Anglo-American dispute. A solution is tentatively proposed below (Annex B,paragraph 17 (iii) ), which would retain for agriculture the ultimate right of unlimitedsubsidisation; but it is not yet possible to say how the Americans would receive this proposalif we did put it forward.
producers by subsidies, by levy-subsidy arrangements or by State^ importmonopolies, provided that these arrangements were not used to raise the priceof food to the home consumer excessively above the world price of imports. Onthe assumption that agriculture is to work its own passage to the fullest possible extent these provisions ought surely to give a sure foundation for aprosperous industry. It is only if agriculture is regarded as being permanentlyor whole-heartedly on the dole that they are inadequate. We are pledged to the farmer to support a prosperous agriculture, but that cannot be taken to mean that at whatever cost to the consumer in expensive food we are to maintainexcessively uneconomic forms of agriculture at excessively inflated levels ofproduction.At Hot Springs we discussed principles of nutrition, the long-termapplication of which would stimulate in this country as elsewhere the demandfor home-produced food-stuffs of a perishable but nutritive character, whichwe are well fitted to produce for ourselves. This may help to form the basisof a policy which is advantageous to our urban consumers, stimulating to ourfarmers and fully compatible with our desire to co-operate economically withother countries. This, combined with the freedoms which we retain under theWashington proposals, can, I submit, form a sure basis for a &quot;healthy and well-balanced agriculture.&apos;1There is an argument affecting the transitional period which appears in annex A, paragraphs 85 to 38. and which, I think, it might be useful for me to comment on here. The critics of the currency scheme seem to believe that theexistence of the long-term arrangements which were contemplated at Washingtonwill jeopardise in some way our position during the transitional period. the americans, so the argument runs, are putting up more than  300,000,000 for relief. Under the currency scheme they are being invited to put up a further 750,000,000, and of this we are the beneficiaries to the extent of nearly half.It is a fact that, irrespective of the fate of the currency scheme, we shall require futher and very substantial assistance from the Americans immediately the waris over. We cannot get along without it. Whatever may be the long-termadvantages of the currency scheme, with all its indirect benefits, what we musthave now is direct financial help. Are not the Americans likely to feel, if the commitment of the currency scheme is added to their commitment forU.N.R.R.A., that they have been generous enough ? Are we not in danger, inour pursuit of the currency agreement, of losing the substantial advantages which, in one way or another, we must persuade the Americans to offer us 1But in this way, the argument is a very formidable one. But if we put it more realistically, it is perhaps less impressive. We&apos; have great favours to askof the Americans, favours which we must have and which, it may be, it will be most difficult for them to grant. We must do nothing, therefore, which willconfuse the issue. We must do everything to create an atmosphere which willbe favourable to us when we come to make our demands upon the Americans.How can this best be arranged ? Clearly, there is only one way. We must rejectout of hand proposals to which the Americans attach great importance, of whichthey are intensely proud, and in the formulation of which they have done a verygreat deal to meet oir special difficulties. We must explain to them that we areno longer interested in the international arrangements which are under discussion between us. We are not looking for help for the United Nations. What we wantis help for the United Kingdom. All of this having been made clear to the americans, we shall have so endeared ourselves to them that incontinently theyAvill meet all our demands.V.The Alternatives to Article VII.I believe that the policy which we discussed at Washington will serve our interests better than any alternative. While I am far from sharing the gloomyapprehensions of some of my colleagues, I can give no assurance that we shallever reach an agreement with the Americans oh these lines. On a cool calculation of the probabilities, it must be regarded, I think, as unlikely. But this policy,u we can achieve it, is so much in our interests, and our first approach to the americans has been so much more promising than we could have dared to hope,that it would be madness to draw back now. And the alternatives are so bad-and.;-:;&apos;[28868J. !t::i:^ &apos;      &apos;&apos;.   &apos; . c
in certain circumstances might be so desperately bad that we would be unwise to embrace them until we are left without any other choice.Perhaps, the most obvious alternative is that we should keep our hands free to make the best use of our bargaining strength as the main importing country of many important commodities. In 1938 the United Kingdom and Irelandaccounted for 80 per cent, of total world imports of beef and mutton, 40 per cent,of world imports of wheat, 36 per cent, of zinc, and 19 per cent, of cotton imports.By a system of quantitative import regulation, of clearing agreements anddiscriminatory State purchases, we might be able to induce certain other countries to take our exports in return for the purchases which we make from them. Thesupplying countries could not readily submit to losing so important a market fortheir principal exports. At the same time we have, in the British commonwealth and Empire and the Sterling Area, a number of prosperous and friendly countries with whom we could work together, in a system of mutual arrangements, to buildover a wide area a progressively expanding economy. It can be argued, too, thatall this would be healthy and in conformity with the spirit of the age which, itis said, is working all the time towards larger national groupings.If we adopt a policy of this kind, we shall have, it is true, a fruitful example to guide us. This is not virgin land. A great deal of valuable pioneering hasalready been done for us by an eminent German financier. And he very nearlypulled it off. Indeed, it can be argued very plausibly that Dr. Schacht was notmisguided but only unfortunate. We shall have advantages that were denied tohim. And Dr. Schacht was setting himself to create a war economy. We, by contrast, will be nourishing and fortifying the arts of peace.It may well be that, in the end, we shall be thrown back upon attempting analternative of this kind. If we fail to reach an agreement with the Americanson a multilateral policy, however, it is possible that we shall find some alternativeless opposed to our interests than a policy of pure bilateralism. Before we chosethe latter we had better consider very carefully what it is that we shall be doingand whither the road will lead us.There is a vast difference between adopting this policy because the americans have refused the other approach and embarking upon it before we have exhaustedevery other alternative. For the latter will be regarded by the Americans as aDeclaration of War. I am convinced that this is so. It is not a matter of party alignment or of who wins the Presidential election. Short of our seeing the Secretary of State for India himself installed in the White House nextJanuary, with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries presiding, as Vice-President, over the Senate, it is impossible to conceive of any change in thepolitical scene in the United States which will affect the truth of the proposition that the adoption by this country of a naked Schachtian policy will be taken asa Declaration of War. And indeed it will be nothing else, for we shall bedeliberately organising the world into rival economic groupings in which notprivate entrepreneurs but powerful Governments will be the protagonists. i cannot see what kind of a political structure we shall be able to erect on afoundation of this kind. .But the evil will not stop there. It is one thing to speak of the Common-wealth and Empire or the Sterling Area as the foundations and buttresses of our new economic policy. But what will be left of either when the gloves are off?What will.be the position of Canada if we come to a break with the UnitedStates on so fundamental an issue ? Canada is not a member of the sterling area. Her economic system is indissolubly bound up with that of the UnitedStates. I think that there can only be one answer to such &quot;a question.Sir Wilfred Laurier would walk again. Reciprocity would become a fact. and what of South Africa ? Is it really conceivable that a country whose economy isbased upon the production of gold would break with her best and perhaps heronly customer? The position of Australia is more doubtful, although it is certain that the American market has many attractions for Australia. We may hope that the position of New Zealand would not be doubtful at all.And then there is the Sterling Area. We are too apt to think of the sterling area as a kind of annexe of the British Empire. It is nothing of the kind. Itis a somewhat fragile association of countries who came together to pool their resources for certain limited purposes, and because they were willing tocontribute what lay in their power to the conduct of a common war. But thearrangements which have been accepted during the war are most unlikely tosurvive it. For what advantages will we have, to offer them against the induce-ments of the United States ? It would not be politic- nor indeed would it benecessary to tell them the truth and to inform them that we were proposing to
make use of them to pull our chestnuts out of the fire for us. We cannot offerthem gold or dollars. We cannot offer them the capital equipment of which theywill be in need. This tenuous gossamer fabric of the Sterling Area woulddissolve like a morning mist exposed to the direct rays of the noonday sun.For these reasons I find some difficulty in understanding some of thearguments put forward in Annex A by the critics of the currency proposalswhich were discussed at Washington. It is said that the adoption of any scheme on these lines would make &quot; the continuance of the sterling area impossible inany form in which we have known it hitherto.&quot; I have an iineasy feeling thatthe argument ought to be put the other way round and that for &quot; impossible &quot;we should, read &quot; possible &quot; if by &quot; sterling area arrangements &quot; we mean theold traditional practices. For, unless our position is strengthened by someexpedient of the kind discussed at Washington, it is not easy to see how the long-standing banking practices of the sterling area can easily continue.It is perfectly true that a system has been developed under war-time conditionsby which &quot; the various sterling countries turn over to us their surplus earnings of foreign exchange and we in return supply them with the foreign exchangethey need, while transactions with the outside world are regulated by systems of exchange control, administered throughout the area on broadly similar lines.&quot;Very useful and convenient this system has been. And very convenient it would continue to be, if there were the remotest chance of our being able to maintain it.It is full of attractions for us. It is more difficult to see what charms it willhave for the other members. For the maintenance of the war-time arrangements of the sterling area depends upon the transactions with the outside world of thearea as a whole being restricted by systems of; exchange control. In other words,Australia forgoes the luxury of American refrigerators or electric razors, NewZealand does without American automobiles, in order to pile up hard currenciesin London and thus to further the common war effort. It has been a most strikingexample of the principle of the pooling of resources. It is possible that thesystem would not have worked so smoothly, even in these times, if it had notbeen for war-time restrictions upon shipping. It is certain that it would notwork at all in normal conditions, and that the Dominions cannot be expected tosubmit to an indefinite lowering of their standards of living, not to win the warbut simply to make London a peace-time financial centre. To invite them todo so is not going to preserve the sterling area. It is more likely to send it upin smoke.Again, it is difficult to follow the line of reasoning which argues that &quot; the inauguration of the scheme before the problem of the sterling balances lias been satisfactorily resolved by direct negotiations between us and the holders of the balances, would make those negotiations more difficult because the discussions would start on the assumption that at the end of a limited Transitional Periodsterling would be freely convertible.&quot; This can only mean that India, for example,foreseeing that the adoption of the currency scheme would greatly alleviateour difficulties, would be more exacting in her demands. This, however, is not an argument against the currency scheme in particular. If it is the case thatan improvement in our position, in this or any other field, is only going to put us at the mercy of our creditors, then, clearly, we would do better to stay aswe are. But I hope that it is not in this kind of a spirit that we are going todeal with India&apos;s sterling balances. I hope, rather, that it will be made clear to India that she, too, must make a financial contribution, in some form or another, to the war effort, and that the balances which she has acquired duringthe war are not to be regarded as the increment of ordinary commerce.I have discussed some of the political consequences which would follow froma repudiation of Article VII. But there would also be economic consequences.The Americans would retaliate in kind. If it is our policy to make economicwar upon the United States (and it is sheer humbug to pretend that this policyis anything else), then the United States will certainly make economic warupon us. So much has been made clear to us. And the armoury of theUnited States is a very powerful one. By assisting the countries which wouldbe our principal customers to develop their secondary industries, the americans would be able to expand their own exports at the expense of our markets. Bysubsidising secondary industries of their own, cotton-spinning, for example, theycould lessen their dependence upon export markets for their stable crops, deny us the raw materials which we require for our own exports or, at any rate, raisethe price against us, and at the same time create a new and formidablecompetition for us to meet in the markets of the world. All this, it may be said,would be grossly uneconomic.   Of course it would.   But we would surely be
unduly innocent if we were to suppose that we should be allowed an unchallengedmonopoly in the new economics. Of course we should have to fight it out. Andin this field, if anywhere, the longest purse and it is not ours- -would win.These are some of the obstacles which we are likely to meet if we followDr. Schacht down the road of bilateralism. If, however, eventually we have to face them, our position will be stronger if we have exhausted, first of all, everyalternative. If it has been made clear beyond all possible doubt that the americans cannot be brought to any reasonable accommodation, if it is clearthat we have been driven to other expedients not from choice but from necessity,then there is a chance, at least, that we shall be able to carry with us the membersof the British Commonwealth and the Sterling Area, It is possible, too, thatwe shall be able to avoid a direct conflict with the United States if it can be shown that the choice is not ours. But to withdraw now from negotiations into which we have freely entered, to pursue a policy which we know is anathema tothe Americans and which, even for us, is only a second best, would be to invitethe sharpest conflict, and one in which we would find ourselves without allies.VI.Matters requiring Cabinet Decision.It is necessary for the Cabinet now to decide whether or not to proceed witha policy generally on the lines discussed at Washington.. We must make up our minds upon this main issue of principle. Only when this has been done will webe able to give the necessary guidance to the officials taking part in the conversa-tions with the Dominions, which start on the 21st February.We must make up our minds on the main issue. But if we decide that weare not going to reverse our policy and that we are going to proceed on the general line of the Washington Conversations, it is essential, in my view, that thereshould&quot;be no reservations of any kind. It has been suggested to me that a possible course might be to keejp the Americans in play on Article VII in such a way asto ensure that the more difficult decisions would be indefinitely postponed and,perhaps, evaded altogether. But this would not only be dishonourable. It wouldbe the most dangerous folly. I hope, therefore, that if the Cabinet decides tocontinue the line of policy which is outlined in this paper, it will be made clear to all concerned that the policy is to be carried through with conviction and a determination to make it successful.Apart from the main issue, there are a number of subsidiary, but never-theless important, matters oil which Ministerial guidance will be required forthe conduct of the talks with the Dominions. These questions are listed at theend of the Annexes to this paper.It would be difficult to decide these complicated and somewhat technicalissues at one, or even a series of Cabinet meetings. I would propose, therefore,that we decide now whether or not we wish to proceed on the general line of.policy discussed at Washington; and, on the assumption that we agree to do so,a Committee of Ministers might be asked to decide before the 21st Februaryon the line to be taken by our officials on the questions raised in Annexes A to Fof this paper.R. L.&quot;Foreign Office, S.W. 1, 7th February, 1944.
ANNEX A.(i) THE PROPOSAL FOR AN INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND.The Present State of Negotiations.1. As a result of the autumn conversations in washington and subsequent inter-changes, a final text(subject to a few matters of secondary importance,( -bout which correspondence is still taking place) hasnow been agreed with the United States Treasury onthe expert level. This text is printed below under the title of a Statement of Principles.2. It would not have been possible to achieve thisagreed text if the United States Treasury had not shown throughout the negotiations an exceedingly con-ciliatory spirit and a marked will to agreement. For,whilst the set-up of the scheme follows the Americanmodel more closely than the British, on matters of substance very large concessions have been made to our point of view.3. The text does not bear a close resemblance to either of its predecessors. It was agreed at washington to set aside both the British Clearing Union draft andthe American Stabilisation Fund draft, and to startafresh with an agreed Statement of Principles whichwould try to cover the main points on which ministers and legislators would require to be satisfied, but wouldnot attempt at this stage to incorporate the completeset of articles which will have to be drafted before thenew institution can come into being. The result is muchshorter than either of the original currency plans andoccupies below less than three pages of print.4. It is suggested that the title of the new institu-tion should be neither the International ClearingUnion, as we originally proposed, nor the InternationalStabilisation Fund, as the Americans proposed, but theInternational Monetary Fund.The extent of our Present Commitments.5. The United States Treasury have been told thatour examination of the proposal has remained so far onthe strictly technical level, that it has not been con-sidered by Ministers and that there are as yet noCabinet instructions whether it is acceptable, either ingeneral or in particular, as a basis for the next stage ofthe discussion. Mr. Morgenthau has, however, beeninformed that the Chancellor of the Exchequerenvisages future procedure as follows:  (i) As soon as possible after the text has beenagreed at the expert level between the twoTreasuries, it will be submited on our side to ministers, who will decide how far or with what amendments they are prepared tosponsor the Statement of Principles as a basisof discussion in Parliament. Meanwhile, weare free to exchange views with representa-tives of India and the Dominions, and theUnited States Treasury is free to communicate the new text to the Russian representativesnow in Washington for monetary conversa-tions. Apart from these exceptions, no state-( ment is to be published on either side untilboth sides have agreed to this course.(&quot;) In the event of publication being agreed upon between the two Governments the Statementwill be communicated to the other Govern-ments concerned and published immediatelyafterwards. In this country it would then bethe subject of debates in the two Houses ofParliament, and Ministers would explain toParliament, in accordance with pledgesalready given, that at this stage and prior tothe expression of views in Parliament theywere in no way committed to the Statementbeyond believing that it embodied a planwinch deserved the most serious consideration.[26868](iii) Any suggestions made as a result of the debates in Parliament or by other Governments wouldthen be considered by us in consultation withthe United States Treasury. After that itwould be for Ministers here to decide whetherthey were in a position to approve a State-ment of Principles being passed on to a draft-ing committee as an instruction. If so, it hasbeen agreed with the&apos; United States Adminis-tration that the Statement would constitute(as Mr. Morgenthau has asked) a definitiveinstruction which would not be departed fromby either of our Governments without theagreement of the other.II.The Main Objects of the Plan.6. The following is a statement of the main objects of the Plan and its attractions as seen more especially by our Washington representatives. Misgivings whichare felt by some Treasury advisers are separately setout in the third section of this note.7. (i) It is a characteristic of British foreign trade that&apos; it often suits us to sell predominantly in certain countries and to buy predominantly in others. our best sources of supply are not always our best markets.It will, therefore, help the expansion of our trade ifwe can re-establish the conditions, generally prevail-ing before 1914, by which the proceeds of sales in one country can be freely applied to purchases in othercountries. The Plan is calculated to secure this objectafter normal conditions have been reached, whilstrequiring a full commitment to a multi-lateral clearingsystem in the transitional period, during which restric-tions will be inevitable.8. (ii) Nevertheless, this freedom from restrictions should  apply only to current business  and not toflights &quot; or uncontrolled movements of capital funds.Experience between the wars clearly demonstrated themischief of unregulated capital movements, wdiich take no account of the balance of trade available for over-seas investment. The Plan provides that members shallhave full liberty of action to control such movements.9. (iii) The ability of members to implementundertakings to secure the first objective above willbe much increased if some attempt is made to redressthe maldistribution of liquid reserves in the shape ofgold and gold-convertible currencies. The provisionnow proposed is much smaller than in the ClearingUnion Plan, but is enough to give the scheme a goodstart and can be increased later on, if it provesnecessary and if the scheme is working well in other respects. Under these proposals the quota of theUnited States would be  750 million, of Great Britainand her Colonies  325 million (with separate quotas for India and the Dominions), and of the world as awhole  2,500 million. The quota represents both themaximum liability on a country to support the fund and also (in normal circumstances) the maximumassistance which a country can receive from the Fund.It also measures the member&apos;s voting power, exceptthat no member is entitled to more than 20 per cent,of the total votes. In our own case we shall be luckyif we end the transitional period with reserves so high as  325 million, so that the Plan is likely to doubleour resources to meet contingencies a measure ofassistance not to be rejected lightly. The amount ofthe gold subscription, where the United states representatives have gone a long way to meet ourobjections, is now put at 25 per cent, of the quota or10 per cent, of a country&apos;s own reserves, whichever isleast. In our own case this will probably work out ata little less than our Washington delegation was instructed to secure.
LU. (iv) Some part of the responsibility for main-taining equilibrium should be placed on the creditorcountries, instead of throwing the whole burden, as hitherto, on the debtor countries. The clause of thePlan dealing with this is of great importance, not leastbecause it has been put forward on the initiative of theAmerican representatives without amendment from our side, and concurred in by the State department and the Federal Reserve Board, as well as by theUnited States Treasury. Under the Clearing UnionPlan the liability on a creditor country to maintainequilibrium by supporting the Fund, if it had failedto do so in some other way, was more or less unlimited.The American representatives felt that Congress would never accept an unlimited liability in advance, and&apos;that some other means must, therefore, be. found for fixing responsibility on a chronic creditor country which was hoarding its earnings from the rest of theworld and failed to return them to circulation either by consumption or by investment.11. Put shortly in terms of the United States as an example, what- the American representatives areoffering the rest of. the world is as follows. Up to anamount of  750 million they put at the disposal of theFund the equivalent of any dollars which may accrue to them from a favourable balance of payments, as aresult of their neither consuming nor investing whatthey earn from their imports. If it appears that the cumulative balance- thus built up is in danger ofexceeding this total, they have the option of gettingrid of their surplus on imports or overseas investment,of increasing their contribution to the Fund whichwould have the effect of making more Americancurrency available, or of accepting the conditions whichbecome applicable when the -Fund has declared dollars to be a &quot;scarce&quot; currency. ;The conditions underthis third alternative mean in effect that Americanexporters can no longer claim payment for their goodsin excess of the amount which the United States is making available on the other side of the account byimporting or by lending. All the other countries ofthe world become entitled forthwith to put any formof restrictions they choose in the way of acceptingAmerican goods and in the way of paying for any theydo accept. To put this third alternative into effect would, it is true, cause great trouble and technicaldifficulty all round. It was, however, the view of theAmerican representatives that from their point of view the third alternative would be so intolerable that itcould never be allowed to come to this in practice andthat their country would be forced to adopt one of theother alternatives. That, indeed, is what they wanted to see forced upon them. They also gave as anadditional reason why this would be the outcome, that,if -a heavy uncovered American surplus develops, thiswill most probably accompany slump conditions inthe United States. In such circumstances theAmerican Administration could never afford to see thewhole of its export industries thrown into confusion.The American representatives were fully aware of the implications of their own proposal. They were moved by their consciousness of how serious to the worldany failure to solve .the problem would be, and of theimportance, therefore, of sufficient pressure to enforce a solution. Nevertheless, the offer is a signal mark of their courage, of their fair-mindedness and of theirsense of responsibility to the other nations of theworld.12. This proposal represents, therefore, a revolu-tionary change for the better compared with theposition in the inter-war period. The american representatives offer voluntarily on behalf of theircountry to abate its former stranglehold on the world&apos;economy and to offer safeguards against its hoardingpropensities forcing deflation on others. Moreover,this particular provision has been published and congress is aware of it; yet, so far, it has not been the target of.any particular criticism. It would seem rashon our part to reject so fair an offer and to risk a return to the chaos and irresponsibility of the formerlack of system.13. (v) Ministers will be particularly concerned witljthe adequacy of the provisions to secure elasticity ofexohange rates. In this respect the American repre-sentatives have been persuaded to depart widely fromtheir original proposals, which seemed to aim atextreme rigidity of exchange on the model of theformer gold standard or, at any rate, could beso represented. The Washington Delegation was authorised to state in plain terms that such arrange-ments could not be accepted by the British cabinet and would be inevitably rejected by Parliament. Asthe result of prolonged discussions, the procedure set-forth in Clause 5 of the Statement of Principles belowemerged; it may be summarised as follows:  (a) The principle of change both in the value of individual currencies and in the value of golditself, to suit changing circumstances, is expressly recognised.(b) A proposal for change by a member country has to be considered judicially by the Fund,from the point of view whether it is in factrequired to remedy disequilibrium; and, if in the actual circumstances it is required, theFund may not refuse it on the ground thatthe explanation of disequilibrium should besought rather in the domestic, social or. political policies of the applicant member, inwhich matters the-Fund may not interfere.(c) Changes  not   exceeding  10  per  cent,  in  theaggregate may be made by a member countryacting, after consultation, but unilaterally.(d) Changes of a further 10 per cent, may be madeunilaterally, unless the Fund has refusedapproval within two days of the applicationfor a change having been made,(c) If a member country is dissatisfied with theFund&apos;s decision on this (or on any other)matter, it can terminate its membership ofthe Fund and resume its full freedom ofaction forthwith, without notice and withoutpenalty.(/) The Fund is particularly required to. take intoconsideration the extreme uncertainties likelyto prevail when the initial parities are fixed,and, during the transitional period, to allow a member asking for a change the benefit ofany reasonable doubt.14. These proposals seem to combine satisfactorilyan orderly procedure for change with retaining asufficient ultimate freedom of action to individual members. They certainly cannot be represented asbeing aimed at gold-standard rigidity. Their wholepurpose is to provide a proper means to secure orderlychanges in what is, of its nature, a two-sided trans-action, and, therefore, a most proper subject for inter-national consultation and adjustment.15. Particular attention is invited to (e) above. TheAmerican representatives were at first most reluctant to accept this provision, but were in the end converted to the.idea that an institution of this kind should he a free association of countries which believe membershipto be to their mutual advantage, and that no attempt should be made to hold a dissatisfied co\mtry to amembership which had become irksome and undesired.In fact this freedom may help to hold the association.^together. The Fund is likely to be more reasonable i\an aggrieved member is free to leave; and a memberis more likely to acquiesce in a decision if he remainsfree at any time to change his mind.16. (vi) If an international institution is to assumesuch wide responsibilities, it must be given some con-siderable measure of authority and of influence. At thesame time it may seem alarming to entrust any wide measure of discretion to a new body which necessarilystarts without traditions, under a management of whosewisdom and impartiality we have as yet no experience.Our object must be, therefore, to secure as much priorcertainty as possible concerning the methods of those responsible for daily management, and to limit their initiative and discretion to cases M&apos;here the rules ana
purposes of the institution are in risk of infringethus keeping them as an instrument, entirely passeineht,passive inall normal circumstances, the right of initiative being reserved to the Central Banks of the member countries.The American representatives had set out in theirStabilisation Fund with quite a different conception ofthe functions of the new institution. In their eyes itshould have wide discretionary and policing powers andshould exercise something of the same measure ofoTaiidmotherly influence and control over the ;central banks of the member countries, that these Central/-Banks in turn are accustomed to exercise over the otherVjanks within their own countries.17. In the course. of discussion, however, theAmerican representatives were persuaded of theinacceptability of such a scheme of things, of theimdesirability of starting off by giving so muchauthority to an untried institution, and of the impor-tance of giving the member countries as much certaintyas possible about what they had to expect from thenew institution and about the amount of facilities which would be at their full disposal. In the final draft,therefore, all the technical, matters at issue, except one,have been in the end settled on the expert level..18. The one matter outstanding which flows from an initial difference of approach by the Clearing union and by the Stabilisation Fund respectively, is asfollows. Under the Clearing Union proposals the member countries were to bank with the institution,where they would have accounts on which they werefree to operate in terms of a new international unit of account, to be called bancor. Under the StabilisationFund proposals the institution was to bank with the member countries, holding accounts with their central banks on which it would be free to operate in termsof each member&apos;s currency, so that no new inter-national unit would be necessary. An internationalmoney of account, unitas, was mentioned in the stabilisation Fund proposals but was only mentioned to be forgotten and played no effective part. Now thisdifference, however important, is nevertheless only amatter of technical form. A given set of proposals canbe drafted in terms of either set-up so as to be identicalin substance and legal effect.19. In the new draft Statement of Principles thereis no new-fangled international unit of account. TheUnited States Treasury and all the other AmericanDepartments, which have been parties to the discus-sion, are strongly of the opinion that this fact would help them greatly in their difficulties with Congress.In a recent message Dr. White writes: &quot;While the emphasis on a new international currency would beattractive to some people it would rouse considerable opposition in this country among those who would feelthat national currencies are being replaced by a new and experimental currency. The task of gaining public support for international monetary co-operation wouldbe increased by the high-lighting in the proposal of anew international currency.&quot;20. Moreover, if this set-up is adopted, it requiresvirtually no new legislation in the United States. no more is necessary than a motion of general approval in congress followed by an appropriation of a part of theresources of the existing United States Stabilisationtund. It is arguable that the other version wouldrequire special legislation which could be representedv s tying up the dollar to a phoney international unit.^1. Whilst there are many advantages in the alterna-wve involving a new international unit which theBritish technical experts would prefer, all the membersof the British Delegation to Washington concerned intflese discussions, who have had the opportunity ofappreciating, face to face, the great efforts made on thewier side to reach agreement, are of the opinion thaton tliAmib  remaining  issue   we   should   defer  to  theencan viewrhere remains -the difficult matter of (vii) thewangements for the transitional period.   This was discussed at Washington as thoroughly as it mightDel6  ,Gen-   The dausea dealing with it,-which the ration brought back, may have been adequate on[26868]a strict legal interpretation but were insuffioientlyexplicit and, therefore, perhaps capable of leading to,misunderstanding later on. A new draft of what isnow clause 11 was, therefore, prepared and sent to dr. White together with a letter making clear theinterpretation which we should want to put on it.Subject to drafting amendments, this clause has nowbeen accepted by the United States Treasury. Itpreserves full freedom of action to us to enforceexchange control during the period before equilibriumhas been restored sufficiently to enable us to removerestrictions. It also states clearly that it is not thepurpose of the Fund to provide facilities for relief orreconstruction or to deal with international indebted-ness arising out of the war; and that members areentitled to be satisfied, before taking on the full com-commitments of the Plan, that they see their way to covertheir balance of payments during the early post-wartransitional period by means which will not undulyencumber their facilities with the Fund.23. Nevertheless, Ministers will wish to assurethemselves not only that we retain sufficient freedomof action during a period which is bound to be verydifficult, but also that we do not prejudice our prospects of other outside aid during this period. It would be fatal if, in spite of the above assurance, we were to be pressed to use the resources of the Fund in the early years, with the result of depriving ourselves of reservesintended to support the commitments which we shouldbe undertaking for the normal period. Although theprobable position in the early post-war years is to aconsiderable extent conjectural and an estimate is still being worked at, it is only prudent to assume that our need.for assistance in that period may be very largeindeed. It may, therefore, be wise that we should take,an early opportunity to express frankly to the UnitedStates Administration what is in our minds; namely,that we cannot enter into this scheme unless there isan assurance of our not being expected to use itsfacilities prematurely, and that we cannot have anysuch assurance until they have given us some indica-tion of the financial regime succeeding the Lend-Leasephase which should, in their opinion, assist a steady progress by ourselves and others into the period whenequilibrium can be secured without large-scaleassistance from outside.24. It might be argued that, in view of all this, weshould postpone the whole scheme. If the scheme were of doubtful long-term advantage to us, this might be the prudent course. If, on the other hand,it is a good scheme from which we, not less than others, have much to gain, and without which weshould risk a return to the inter-war chaos, we shouldbe unwise not to clinch the matter as soon as we havean opportunity to do so. Moreover, in certain respects the new institution may be of particular value, duringthe early, difficult years. It is then that order and discipline in foreign exchange rates will be particularly important. And it is then that an authoritative organof international discussion and consultation can play a specially significant part in finding the way out ofthe transition, where we should sit as equals, insteadof waiting on the mat outside the United states treasury. Those who have tasted the delights of thelatter must be forgiven for showing some ardour infavour of the alternative. Further, it is very desirablethat the new institution should have an opportunity toorganise itself and find its feet before it has to under-take its full responsibilities. Above all a concreteexample of international agreement for post-war economic policy will show that all the talk of suchis not mere words. If the scheme is indefinitelypostponed, it is exceedingly likely never to come intoforce.V.-..-.&apos;- -&apos; &apos;. &apos; &quot;&apos; v;. &apos;&apos;III.25. This section of the note sets out the strongmisgivings which are felt by some Treasury advisersabout any decision at this stage to commend a scheme in its present form to the approval of the Dominionsand of Parliament.d 2
26. While accepting the main objectives, they fear that the scheme contains immediate disadvantages and serious dangers. For example, the continuance of the sterling area as we have known it hitherto would be seriously prejudiced and the difficulties of handling the problem of our sterling balances would beincreased. The Exchange Clause may be quitereasonable for limiting a deliberate devaluation of the currency of any country, but most depreciations in thepast have been involuntary and the possibility thatthey may again be involuntary does not seem to be covered. The clause about the transitional periodconceals an ambiguity which might prove dangerousin practice. No country without strong monetaryreserves could decide to abandon exchange restrictions and make its currency freely convertible, until it had achieved a satisfactory balance of payments andbelieved that could be maintained. Thus therestrictions might be maintained by many countries fora prolonged period. We would not enjoy theadvantages of multilateral payments and should beselling part of our exports for currencies which wecould not convert into other currencies. This mightforce us to buy from some sources of supply ratherthan others, and if this went on for a long period, as isquite likely, we should expose ourselves to a charge of discrimination and bad faith.27. The Scheme is admittedly designed for the longterm when international equilibrium has been reasonably established. There is no dispute that&apos;agreement on long-term objectives would be helpfulfor the transitional period. The Plan, however, goesfar beyond a statement of objectives; it is a detailed scheme containing the rules which will be binding upon the signatory countries and the ExecutiveManagement. ^ *28. On this view it is open to serious questionwhether we can see far enough ^ihead for ourselves and others closely associated with us to take theresponsibility of attempting to secure a binding inter-national agreement, at this stage, for such a detailedplan. If we were to commit ourselves to it we shouldhave to join in exerting pressure upon the Dominionsand India - and the European Allies to overcomeobjections and misgivings which on merits we maylargely share.29. The chief criticisms which underlie - these mis-givings may be thus briefly stated.(a) Multilateral Clearing.30. We could not hope to discharge for an indefinite period the obligation which constitutes the centralpurpose of the Scheme, namely, to make sterling freelyconvertible. This is not only because of the problemof sterling balances which we cannot expect to blockaltogether but because we expect for the first fewyears after the war to have a heavy adverse balance on current account and shall not be able to sell all our exports for freely convertible currency.31. It may well be thought unsatisfactory that the shape of a Scheme to help international trade should begin by recognising the inevitable contracting out from the major purpose of the Scheme by the country which, before the war, had the largest international trade.(b) Exchange rates.32. We, and other countries, would be required from the outset to maintain definite parities ofexchange and to support them by the use of our mone-tary reserve. These parities could be varied from timeto time with the approval of the Fund, but at any time there would be definite parities in terms of gold whichwe should be obliged to support.33. At present we have a managed exchange rate;it is not formally tied to gold or to any other currency.We are free to appreciate or depreciate sterling and free to let it find its own level with no fixed paritywithout any obligations except those of the tripartite agreement for consulting the United States&apos; andFrance.34. Although the major international exchange rates should not be changed suddenly without consultation between the parties chiefly concerned, the technique of consultation would still leave it possible to decide to remove all &quot; pegs &quot; and allow the rate to move to whatever level proves appropriate. There is a widedifference between this and a formal internationalobligation to maintain a definite parity. It is oftenimpossible to determine in advance the level at whichit would be wise to try to check a further fall by thefree use of limited monetary reserves. In 1931 sterlingfell by nearly one-third before a process of market?recovery began; and any attempt to hold it before thispoint was reached might have proved futile.(e) Inadequacy of credits.35. The credit. facilities provided by the scheme are not distributed according to the immediate needsof the countries who have suffered the greatesteconomic damage from the war. They are soinadequate for our own discernible needs that we mustprotect ourselves against being compelled to use them up for fear that we prejudice our chances of obtainingadditional assistance.36. Our quota under the Scheme is  325 millionagainst which we have to subscribe  40 million ingold. In any one year we may only draw 25 per cent,of our quota, i.e.,  80 million. This will be inadequate to see us through our adverse balance on current account.37. The United States would be committedformally and forthwith to put up  750 million for thepurpose of the Plan. This is a large sum which Con-gress and American public opinion might regard,together with their contribution towards U.N.K.R.A.,as a fair discharge of their moral obligation to put theworld economically on its feet, and if we contemplatehaving to approach the Americans for additional directhelp, we might well be disappointed.38. In this situation we are contemplating suggest-ing a clause to the Americans which would make it plain that a country is not expected to use the financialfacilities of the Fund so long as it exercises its contract-ing out rights on multilateral clearing; this is to leave us free to make the. best bargain we can with the americans.(d) The &quot; Passivity &quot; of the Fund.39. In paragraph 7 (a) of W.P. (43) 383 we laid it down as the most important of our &quot; minimum require-ments &quot; that, in order that sterling should not be prejudiced by the operation of an international mone-tary authority, the Fund should be entirely passive andshould not be in a position in any way to deal in-currencies. In order to safeguard this position it was proposed (1)- that the subscriptions of member countries to the Fund should not include any contributions-tion in their currencies but should be composed entirely of gold and non-negotiable Government securities,(2) that the subscription so composed should be kept&apos;as a security for the liabilities of the countries con-cerned and should not be used by the Fund for itsordinary operations; and (3) that the transactions ofthe Fund should be conducted in terms of an inter-national &quot; money of account,&quot; which would effectuallydistinguish them from any dealing in exchanges. From&apos;our discussions with the European Allies it was believed that they would support us unanimously in pressing for these fundamental conditions.40. None of these conditions is fulfilled.41. In place of the composite but related safeguardssuggested to ensure &quot; passivity,&quot; the scheme has now only one safeguard, namely, that the Fund cannot deal in currencies on its own initiative, but can only supply the currency on the request of a member bank in exhange for that member bank&apos;s own currency o*gold.42. It is feared that this safeguard is more effectiveon paper than it would be likely to prove in practice.It is possible that when the scheme is published this
proviso will be widely regarded, as anomalous. Whyput the Fund in possession of national currencies ifthey are not permitted to use them at their discretionfco help to keep exchange rates reasonably stable, to watch over the position in each country and to offerthat country facilities?43. Because the scheme, despite . the very important modifications secured by our Delegation,still has the essential shape of an Exchange equalisation-tion Fund, it is believed that inevitably the manage-ment would use &quot;initiative,&quot; however discreetly. Ifshey found that they were beginning to accumulateiiu-ue holdings of a particular currency, nearing thelimit of the permissible holdings, banking traditionswould dispose them to try to make their position moreliquid by suggesting to some member country that theyshould temporarily exchange part of the surpluscurrency for their own currency. Such an initiative,however discreet, would, so it is said, become known and the &apos;&apos; surplus &apos;&apos; currency would be regarded asopen to some suspicion. Since sterling is bound tobe a &quot; surplus &quot; currency for some years after thewar, this is a possibility that we are bound to consider.(e) The Sterling Area.44. The scheme must tend to weaken the cohesionof the sterling area, and would probably make its continuance impossible in any form in which we haveknown it hitherto. The sterling area has evolvednaturally from the close economic relations whichhave linked together most parts of the BritishCommonwealth (Canada being the most importantexception), and certain other countries. Before thewar the arrangements were purely informal; thecountries belonging to the area kept their monetaryreserves in London in the form of sterling balances;they looked to London for assistance and advice; andtheir currencies were for the most part tied to sterlingrather than to gold. Thus within the sterling areathere was exchange stability and multilateral clearing.During the war these practices have been developedinto more formal arrangements under which thevarious sterling countries turn over to us their surplus-earnings of foreign exchange, and we in return supply them with the foreign exchange they need, whiletransactions with the outside world are regulated bysystems of exchange control, administered throughoutthe area on broadly similar lines. These arrangements,though they could not, of course, be continued inpeace time in their present form, have been of thegreatest advantage to us during the war.45. Under the monetary scheme, the Dominions andIndia would, be independent member countries withtheir own individual quotas, and their own separateobligations to make their currencies freely convertible,to abandon exchange restrictions and to maintain theparities of their currencies subject to the variousprovisos which the scheme contains. It is evidentthat one part of the area might feel able to dispense with some of the transitional safeguards before otherscould do so; and for this and similar reasons, it seems inevitable that the area would disintegrate as a resultof the operation of the scheme.46. It would be a serious matter to destroy one ofthe flexible joints in the organisation of the British/Commonwealth at the beginning of a period ofLievitable political confusion and disturbance over alarge part of the world. Just as the area in its politicalsense represents a stabilising factor and some con-discontinuity of principle, so it has the same value in economic affairs.47. The sterling area in the form in which it hasbeen evolved during the war will no doubt have tobe modified for post-war conditions. On the othernand, it is quite likely that some other importantareas, including the French, Belgian and Dutch-^uipires, whose economy is in some respects com-plenaentary to our own, might wish to associateJiemselves with the sterling area for certain purposes,progressively over that expanded area - multilateralc eanng could be introduced and the major centres inthe area could establish links with the United states which might make it practicable to carry multilateralclearing much further, and faster than would bepossible under the currency scheme.48. One aspect of the sterling area system in thewar creates very special difficulties for us, viz., the sterling balances held by one or two members,particularly India and Egypt.49. The inauguration of the scheme before theproblem of the sterling balances has been satisfactorilyresolved by direct negotiation, between us and the holders of the balances would make those negotiationsmore difficult because the discussions would start onthe assumption that at the end of a limitedTransitional Period sterling would be freely con-vertible. The fact that we would be able to appeal toa clause in the scheme which, in substance,distinguishes abnormal war balances from futurebalances on current account would not make theclause more palatable or its authorship free fromsuspicion.(f) Relations with Commercial Policy.50. The Currency Scheme is at a stage far inadvance of Commercial Policy, although public opinion would expect the two Schemes to march forwardtogether. The close relation of the policies isimportant to us because some of the safeguards opento us if we get into difficulties will depend upon the shape of agreed Commercial Policy.51. Informed opinion would want to be satisfiedthat the United States was likely to pursue a com-mercial policy likely to facilitate balanced payments with the outside world. On the other hand, our ability to defend any parity for sterling against adversepressure might be seriously affected by undertakings,o.g., as regards import restrictions, which we mightlater be expected to give.(g) &quot;Scarce currencies.&quot;52. Great importance is attached to Clause 7 of theAgreement on Scarce Currencies, for the reason explained in the preceding section of this note(paragraphs 10-12). The clause is declaratory and itmay be that the acceptance of it by the american administration as a whole would be sufficient toprevent the United States consciously allowing the dollar to become scarce because they sell abroad morethan they are prepared to buy and will not invest thedifference. But, technically, too much reliance cannotbe placed upon the clause as a sanction. The&quot; apportionment &quot; of scarce currencies would createvery considerable difficulties and exchange controlrestrictions against the dollar, unless appliedsimultaneously, and as part of a general- controlmechanism by all major countries through whosecurrency dollar transactions would pass, are regardedas unworkable.(h) International Executive Management.53. When the two original schemes were published,uninstructed vocal opinion in America fixed on thequestion of voting rights and control. As so muchAmerican money will be involved in this scheme, it is inevitable that the same questions would arise again.The American Treasury have generously acceptedvoting arrangements on the Board of Directors whichwould not give them a majority position. It is not certain that such a suggestion would commend itselfto American opinion in its present mood. Moreover,it is not the voting right of the directors that reallymatters on the daily business of the Fund, but thecompetence and impartiality of the executivemanagers. In the present atmosphere of politics inthe United States, it seems highly unlikely that such a management would be chosen without very full regard for purely political considerations.54. There is one final point and not the leastimportant. As this scheme deliberately excludes the transitional Period and does not attempt to provide
for- the problems of reconstruction, it will not beregarded as an international necessity, even with possible deficiencies, in the same way as U.N.E.R.A;was regarded.55. But for such a novel and detailed international monetary plan a wide acceptance is almost necessary from the beginning. It is by no means clear that itwill be acceptable in this sense to the opinion of the americans, either Congress or among the informedpublic- As far as we can judge, it will be regarded withhostility by the New York banking system, whoseco-operation in it will be essential if it is to endure.56. In these circumstances, and particularly becauseof the present uncertainties on a solution of the transitional problems, and of the relation betweendecisions on commercial policy and the CurrencyScheme, those at the Treasury who hold the viewsdescribed above would urge that early publication ofthe Scheme is desirable, but that Ministers should dono more than present it for the careful attention ofParliament, without committing themselves to recom-mending its early inauguration in its present form,until they have been able to gather the views ofParliament, of the Dominions, of the United States andof the European Allies and other United Nations.(ii) STATEMENTJoint Statement by Experts of United andAssociated Nations on the Establishment of anInternational Monetary Fund.Sufficient discussion of the problems of international monetary co-operation has taken place at the technicallevel to justify a statement of principles. The experts of the United and Associated Nations who haveparticipated in these discussions are of the opinionthat the most practical method of iissuring inter-national monetary co-operation is through the estab-lishment of an International Monetary Fund. Theyhave set forth below the principles which they believeshould be the basis for this Fund. Governments arenot asked to give final approval to these principlesuntil they have been embodied in the form ofdefinitive proposals by the delegates of the Unitedand Associated Nations meeting in a formalconference.1. Preamble.The International Monetary Fund is designed as apermanent institution for international monetaryco-operation. The Fund is intended to facilitate thebalanced growth of international trade and to contri-bute in this way to the maintenance of a high levelof employment. The Fund is expected to provide themachinery for consultation on international monetaryproblems. The resources of the Fund would beavailable under adequate safeguards to help member countries to maintain exchange stability while giving them time to correct maladjustments in their balanceof payments without resorting to measures destructiveto national or international prosperity.&apos;2. Purposes of the F.und.(i) To promote exchange stability, to maintainorderly exchange arrangements among member countries and to avoid competitive exchange depreciation.(ii) To assure multilateral payments facilities on current transactions among member countries and tohelp eliminate foreign exchange restrictions thathamper the growth of world trade.(iii) To shorten the period and lessen the degree ofdisequilibrium in the international balance of payments of member countries.(iv) To give confidence to member countries by theprovision of actual and potential support in the attainment of these purposes.3. Subscription to the Fund.(i) Member countries shall subscribe in gold and intheir, local funds amounts (quotas) determined by a57. The questions for settlement by the cabinet are:  (1) whether the Plan is provisionally approved;(2) if so, whether the lines of procedure as statedto Mr. Morgenthau should stand, namely,that upon publication being agreed upon between the two Governments the Statementof Principles should be communicated to the-other Governments concerned and then bethe subject of debates in Parliament here,Ministers explaining that at this stage andprior to the expression of views in Parlia-. ment, they were in no way committed to theStatement beyond believing that it embodieda Plan which deserved the most serious- consideration (paragraph 5);(3) whether a communication should be made to washington at the first convenient oppor-tunity leading up to representations in the sense of paragraphs 22 and 23 in regard tothe transitional period;(4) the broad lines to be followed in the forthcoming discussions with the Dominions.OF PRINCIPLES., formula to be agreed, which will amount altogether toabout $8 billion if all the United Nations and thecountries associated with them subscribe to the Fund(corresponding to about $10 billion for the world asa whole).(ii) The obligatory gold subscription of a member country shall be fixed at 25 per cent, of its subscriptions-tion (quota) or 10 per cent, of its holdings of gold and gold-convertible exchange, whichever is thesmaller. The amount of the holdings of gold andgold-convertible currency for the purposes of this.clause and clause 4 (viii) below shall be determinedby agreement between each member countrv and theFund.4. Transactions with the Fund.(i) Member countries shall deal with the Fund only through their Treasury, Central Bank, StabilisationFund, or other fiscal agencies. The Fund&apos;s account in a member&apos;s currency shall be kept at the central bank of the member country,(ii) A member shall be entitled to buy another member&apos;s currency from the Fund in exchange for itsown currency, provided that (a) the member represents that the currencydemanded is presently needed for making pay-ments in that currency which are consistent with the purposes of the Fund;(6) the Fund has not given notice that its holdings of the currency demanded have becomescarce, in which case the pi-provisions of 7 belowcome into force;(c) the Fund&apos;s total holdings of the currency offeredhave not increased by more than 25 per cent,of the member&apos;s quota during the previoustwelve months, and do not exceed 200 percent, of the quota;(d) the Fund has not previously given appropriate &apos;)notice that the member is suspended from &apos;making further use of the Fund&apos;s resources onthe ground that it is making use&apos; of them in a manner contrary to the purposes and policyof the Fund; and(e) the Fund may in its discretion and on conditions ,which safeguard its interests waive any of theconditions above,(iii) Subject to (iv) below, operations on the Fund&apos;s account will be limited to transactions for the purposeof supplying a member country, on the member&apos;s rinitiative and subject to the provisions of (ii) above,with another member&apos;s currency in exchange for itsown currency or for gold.
(iv) The Fund will be entitled at its option, with aview to preventing a particular member?s currencyfrom becoming &quot; scarce &quot; (a) to borrow its currency from a member country;(b) to offer gold to a member country in exchange for its currency.(v) So long as a member country is entitled to buyanother member&apos;s currency from the Fund in exchange for its own currency, it shall be prepared to buy its owncurrency from that member with that niember&apos;scurrency or with gold. This shall not apply to currencysubject to restrictions in conformity with 10 (hi) belowor to holdings of currency which have accumulated as aresult of transactions of a current account natureeffected before the removal by the member country of restrictions on multilateral clearing maintained orimposed under 11 (ii) below.(vi) A member country desiring to obtain, directly or indirectly, the currency of another member countryfor gold is expected, provided it can do so with equaladvantage, to acquire the currency by the sale of gold to the Fund. This shall not preclude the sale of newlymined gold by a gold producing country on any market.(vii) A member country may repurchase from theFund for gold any part of the latter&apos;s holdings of its currency.(viii) So long as a member&apos;s holdings of gold andgold-convertible exchange exceed its quota it shall not allow the Fund&apos;s holdings of its currency to increase over a year by more than the amount by which its hold-ings of gold and gold-convertible exchange have decreased. Furthermore, if at the end of the year amember&apos;s holdings of gold and gold-convertibleexchange have increased, the Fund may require up to half of the increase to be used to repurchase part of theFund&apos;s holdings of its currency, so long as this doesnot reduce the Fund&apos;s holdings of a member&apos;s currencybelow its original currency subscription or the mern-ber&apos;s holdings of gold and gold-convertible exchangebelow its quota.standing 8 (iii) below, such a change shall require the -approval of all member countries with 10 per cent, ormore of the aggregate quotas.0. Capital Transactions.(i) A member country may not use the Fund&apos;resources to meet a large or sustained outflow ofcapital, and the Fund may require a member countryto exercise controls to prevent such use of the resourcesof the Fund. This provision is not intended to preventthe use of the Fund&apos;s resources for capital transactionsof reasonable amount required for the expansion of exports or in the ordinary course of trade, banking orother business. Nor is it intended to prevent capital movements which, are met out of a member country&apos;sown resources of gold and foreign exchange, providedsuch capital movements are in accordance with thepurposes of the Fund.(ii) Subject to 7 below, a member country may not use its control of capital movements to restrict pay-ments for current transactions or to delay unduly thetransfer of funds in settlement of commitments.7. Apportionment of Scarce Currencies.(i) When it becomes evident to the Fund that thedemand for a member country&apos;s currency may soonexhaust the Fund&apos;s holdings of that currency, theFund shall so inform member countries and propose an . equitable method of apportioning the scarce currency. When a currency is thus declared scarce,the Fund shall issue a report embodying the causes ofthe scarcity and containing recommendations designedto bring it to an end.(ii) A decision by the Fund to apportion a scarce currency shall operate as an authorisation to a member country, after consultation with the Fund, temporarilyto restrict the freedom of exchange operations in theaffected currency, and in determining the manner of restricting the demand and rationing the limited supplyamong its nationals the member country shall have complete jurisdiction.5. Par Values of Member Currencies.(i) The par value of a member&apos;s currency shall beagreed with the Fund when it is admitted to member-ship, and shall be expressed in terms of gold. Alltransactions between the Fund and members shall beat par. subject to a fixed charge payable by the member making application to the Fund, and all trans-actions in member currencies shall be at rates within an agreed percentage of parity.(ii) Subject to (v) below, no change in the par valueof a member&apos;s currency shall be made by the Fundwithout the country&apos;s approval. Member countriesagree not to propose a change in the parity of their currencies unless they consider it appropriate to thecorrection of a fundamental disequilibrium. Changesshall be made only with the approval of the Fund,subject to the provisions below.(hi) The Fund shall approve a requested change inthe par value of a member&apos;s currency, if it is essentialto the correction of a fundamental disequilibrium. InParticular, the Fund shall not reject a requestedchange, necessary to restore equilibrium, because ofthe domestic social or political policies of the country-Applying for a change. In considering a requestedchange, the Fund shall take into consideration theextreme uncertainties prevailing at the time theParities of member countries were initially agreed upon.(iv) After consulting the Fund, a member countryway change. the established parity of its currency,provided the proposed change, inclusive of anyPl&apos;previous change since the establishment of the Fund,does not exceed 10 per cent.   In the &apos;case of applica-&apos;on tor a further change, not covered by the above a&quot;d not exceeding 10 per cent., the Fund shall give its decision within two clays of receiving the application,11 the applicant so requests.(v) Provision shall be made for an agreed uniformchange in the gold value of currencies.     Notwith-8. Management.(i) The Fund shall be managed by a Board of directors and Executive Committee representing themembers.(ii) The distribution of basic voting power shall beciosely related to quotas, but no member shall beentitled to cast more than one-fifth of the aggregatevotes.(iii) All matters shall be settled by majority, exceptthat a change in the basis of determining quotasshall require a four-fifths vote, and no member&apos;s quotamay be changed without its assent.9. Withdrawal.(i) A member country may withdraw from the Fundby giving notice in writing.(ii) The. reciprocal obligations of the Fund and thecountry are to be liquidated within a reasonable time.(iii) After a member country has given notice inwriting of its withdrawal from the Fund, the Fundmay not dispose of its holdings of the country&apos;scurrency except in accordance with the arrangementsmade tinder (ii) above. After a country has given notice of withdrawal, its right to utilise the resourcesof the Fund is subject to the approval of the Fund.10. Obligations of Member Countries.(i) Not to buy gold at a price above the parity of its currency, nor to sell gold at a price below the parity of its currency.(ii) Not to allow exchange transactions in itsmarkets in the currencies of other members at ratesoutside a prescribed range based on the agreedparities.(iii) Not to impose restrictions on payments for current international transactions with other member

Furthermore, if at the end of the year ameniber&apos;s holdings of gold and gold-convertibleexchange have increased, the Fund may require up to half of the increase to be used to repurchase part of theFund&apos;s holdings of its currency, so long as this doesnot reduce the Fund&apos;s holdings of a member&apos;s currencybelow its original currency subscription or the mem-ber&apos;s holdings of gold and gold-convertible exchangebelow its quota.standing 8 (iii) below, such a change shall require theapproval of all member countries with 10 per cent, ormore of the aggregate quotas.0. Capital Transactions.(i) A member country may not use the Fund&apos;resources to meet a large or sustained outflow ofcapital, and the Fund may require a member countryto exercise controls to prevent such use of the resourcesof the Fund. This provision is not intended to preventthe use of the Fund&apos;s resources for capital transactionsof reasonable amount required for the expansion of exports or in the ordinary course cjf trade, banking orother business. Nor is it intended to prevent capital movements which are met out of a member country&apos;sown resources of gold and foreign exchange, providedsuch capital movements are in accordance with thepurposes of the Fund.(ii) Subject to 7 below, a member country may. not use its control of capital movements to restrict pay-ments for current transactions or to delay unduly thetransfer of funds in settlement of commitments.7. Apportionment of Scarce Currencies.(i) When it becomes evident to the Fund that thedemand for a member country&apos;s currency may soonexhaust the Fund&apos;s holdings of that currency, theFund shall so inform member countries and propose an equitable method of apportioning the scarce currency. When a currency is thus declared scarce,the Fund shall issue a report embodying the causes ofthe scarcity and containing recommendations designedto bring it to an end.(ii) A decision by the Fund to apportion a scarce currency shall operate as an authorisation to a member country, after consultation with the Fund, temporarilyto restrict the freedom of exchange operations in theaffected currency, and in determining the manner of restricting the demand and rationing the limited supplyamong its nationals the member country shall have complete jurisdiction.5. /V/?&apos; Values of Member Currencies.(i) The par value of a member&apos;s currency shall beagreed with the Fund when it is admitted to member-ship, and shall be expressed in terms of gold.

Member countriesagree not to propose a change in the parity of their currencies unless they consider it appropriate to thecorrection of a fundamental disequilibrium. Changesshall be made only with the approval of the Fund,subject to the provisions below.(iii) The Fund shall approve a requested change inthe par value of a member&apos;s currency, if it is essentialto the correction of a fundamental disequilibrium. - Inparticular, the Fund shall not reject a requestedchange, necessary to restore equilibrium, because oftbe domestic social or political policies of the countryapplying for a change. In considering a requestedchange, the Fund shall take into consideration theextreme uncertainties prevailing at the time theParities of member countries were initially agreed upon.(iv) After consulting the Fund, a member country may change the established parity of its currency,Provided the proposed change, inclusive of any previous change since the establishment of the Fund,does not exceed 10 per cent. In the case of applica-tion for a further change, not covered by the above and not exceeding 10 per cent., the Fund shall give itsrtepision within two days of receiving the application,lE &quot;re applicant so requests.(v) Provision shall be made for an agreed uniformchange in the gold value of currencies.

Withdrawal.(i) A member country may withdraw from the Fundby giving notice in writing.(ii) The. reciprocal obligations of the Fund and thecountry are to be liquidated within a reasonable time.(iii) After a member country has given notice inwriting of its withdrawal from the Fund, the Fundmay not dispose of its holdings of the country&apos;scurrency except in accordance with the arrangementsmade under (ii) above. After a country has given notice of withdrawal, its right to utilise the resourcesof the Fund is sxfbject to the approval of the Fund.10. Obligations of Member Countries.(i) Not to buy gold at a price above the parity of its currency, nor to sell gold at a price below the parity of its currency.(ii) Not to allow exchange transactions m itsmarkets in the currencies of other members at ratesoutside a prescribed range based on the agreedparities.(iii) Not to impose restrictions on payments for current international transactions with other member
countries (other than those involving capital transfersor in accordance with 7 above) or to engage in anydiscriminatory currency arrangements or multiplecurrency practices without the approval of the Fund.11. Transitional Arrangements.(i) Since the Fund is not intended to provide facilities for relief or reconstruction or to deal with international indebtedness arising out of the war, theagreement of a member country to provisions 4 (v)and 10 (iii) above shall not become operative until itis satisfied as to the arrangements at its disposal tofacilitate the settlement of balance of paymentsdifferences during the early post-war transitional period by means which will not unduly encumber itsfacilities with the Fund.(ii) During this transition period member countries may maintain and adapt to changing circumstancesexchange regulations of the character which havebeen in operation during the war, but they shall under-take to withdraw as soon as possible by progressivestages any restrictions which impede multilateralclearing on current account. In their exchange policy they shall pay continuous regard to the principles and objectives of the Fund; and they shall take allpossible measures to develop commercial and financial relations with other member countries which will facilitate international payments and the maintenanceof exchange stability.(iii) The Fund may make representations to anymember that conditions are favourable to the with-drawal of particular restrictions or for the generalabandonment of restrictions inconsistent with 10 (bTabove.

In the main body of this report (Section 1)reference has been made to the commitments which have been incurred under Article VII, and tothe Cabinet decisions which have already been reachedhow those commitments can best be met. Theproblems of commercial policy raised at Washingtonmust be judged . against the background of these commitments and previous Cabinet decisions.I. The Transitional Period.2. The discussions at Washington turned primarilyupon the long run. Little detailed study was madeof the special problems of the immediate post-war period, although- as the following section of the joint anglo-American document on commercial policyshows there was full realisation that exceptional measures will be necessary :  &quot; In the emergency period during and imme-diately following the war import prohibitions andquantitative limitations would be permitted when necessary to meet emergencies arising from (a) thenecessity of rationing imports because of shortages of supplies, shipping or foreign exchange, and(b) a temporary surplus of stocks of the commodityto which the restriction applies. These temporaryexceptions would be applicable for a specifiedlimited period after the cessation of hostilities unlessthe period of their application were further extended by action of the proposed international commercial policy organisation.&quot;Before further progress can be made, the cabinet must consider how these and other exceptionaltransitional measures should be applied.3. The central question is : On what conditions andat what date should the obligations of the proposedcommercial convention come into operation? one important condition is that a sufficient number of thecommercially important countries should adhere toit. It might be unwise for us to bind ourselves tofar-reaching obligations in a convention to which theUnited States and other important countries were notparties (even though we did not extend the advantages of the convention to non-member States). It might,therefore, be wise to make the coming into force ofthe convention conditional upon its ratification by anumber of States sufficient on the basis of pre-warfigures to account for an agreed proportion of totalworld trade.4. If the United States and the United Kingdomreach agreement, there will be very strong forces atcL policy.work to induce other countries to join in. Canada, we know, is anxious to join. Some other countries (suchas the &quot;Oslo Group,&quot; covering Sweden, Norway,Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium) will certainlywish to adhere. The ex-enemy States can be requiredto join. The countries so far listed above accounted,with their colonies and dependencies, for no less than60 per cent, of total world trade in 1938. Many othercountries would in such circumstances easily be persuaded to join because of the disadvantages ofstaying out of so extensive a &quot; low tariff &quot; club.5. There are a number of reasons for agreeing theconvention at as early a date as possible. The favour-able psychological moment may be lost if dispute ondifficult i^points of detail is long postponed after the war.A long-period target of sanity is required to influence the commercial policies of the transitional period.Moreover, it will be desirable to set up an international commercial policy organisation at an early date, sincean effective international secretariat cannot be built up overnight, and (as is suggested in the nextparagraph) an international organisation will be needed-to provide a focus for exchange of information andviews on transitional commercial policy arrangements and their progressive adaptation to the commercial union scheme.6. But if the convention is agreed at an early date,it must expressly provide for exceptional transitional arrangements. The transitional period itself might fall into two parts :  (i) During the first phase, the international com-&apos;mercial policy organisation would be set up,but member countries would not be bound bythe obligations of the convention limiting theirprotective and discriminatory action. Theywould remain free to control their trade in .any exceptional way deemed necessary durinjthe immediate post-war dislocation. But theymight properly be required to consult with each other, through the machinery of theinternational organisation, on the best meansof avoiding mutually injurious measuresduring this period, and of so arranging theirexceptional measures that they led as readilyas possible into the long-run arrangementsenvisaged under the convention,(ii) There would follow a second phase of a specifiedduration, during which member countries would be under an obligation to take clearly defined steps towards the final objective.During this phase, tariffs would have to be
reduced, preference margins to be narrowed,and quotas enlarged, by specified minima eachyear until the full obligations of the conven-tion were in force.7. How should the duration of these transitional arrangements be determined&apos;? There are, broadly speaking, two ways:-(i) The duration of these periods might be named in  the  convention   itself.    Thus,   the  firstphase might be defined as lasting (say) twoyears from the adoption of the convention;( and the subsequent phase as covering the next(say) three years. Such an arrangement would have the advantage of setting a definitetarget for the full application of the conven-tion; and it would not preclude the possibilityof prolongation of these phases if there wereagreement among States covering a sufficientvolume of world trade. (See paragraph above.)(ii) Alternatively,    the    convention    might,    leaveundefined the length of the first phase. Inthis case it might be possible to arrange that agreement among States covering on the basisof pre-war figures some agreed proportion of world trade (see paragraph 3 above) would berequired to bring the second phase into opera-tion. If this proportion were high enough,it would be virtually certain that the second phase could not start without our agreement.For not only did our own pre-war tradeaccount for a large part of total world trade;but our example in such a matter would befollowed at least by the devastated countriesin Europe which will require time for theirown reconstruction and very probably by many other countries as well.8. Arrangements of the kind suggested above would leave us free to regulate our imports and to encourageor control our exports by any devices, however&quot;discriminatory&quot; or &quot;protective,&quot; during the firsttransitional period, and would provide a subsequentperiod of gradual adaptation and relaxation. Weshould, of course, in any case retain indefinitely theopportunity to regulate our imports on grounds of serious balance of payments difficulties, since this is contemplated as a permanent feature of the con-vention. Moreover, if the second alternativesuggested in the preceding paragraph were adopted,we should also virtually retain the ultimate right to prolong the exceptional measures of the transitional period us long as we considered this necessary.II. The Long-term Arrangements.9. The criticism that the commercial policy arrange.;nients discussed at Washington will unduly hamperour internal economic policy, cannot, on examination,be sustained. On the contrary, if we can persuade the americans finally to accept them, they shouldpositively help us in achieving internal economic stability. One of our chief concerns after the war willbe to maintain a steady internal.level of employment,prices and incomes. An unfavourable balance of. pay-/ \ents may be generated or prolonged, if we-jccessfully maintain our prices and purchasing powerwhile there is a general decline in economic activityelsewhere. The proposals made at Washingtoncontain the principle (which the American officialsaccepted) that only countries in: serious balance of pay-wents difficulties should be free to set quantitative&quot;Bits to their imports. If, therefore, we should in the&quot;tine suffer from a serious balance of payments problem as a result of an internal, policy of stabilisation,R should regain our freedom to control imports, with-out other countries, whose balances of payments were0&apos; unfavourable, becoming free to impede our export&apos;m ort- t,u-rnselves seeing quantitative, limits to their[26868]10. On balance the Washington proposals shouldgreatly help us to expand our export trade by limiting the barriers raised against our exports. To a country which imports essentials and exports manufacturedgoods which are less essential to our customers than our imports are to us, a general clearance of the channels of trade is of first-rate importance. the favourable effect upon our export trade would be offset to some extent by the loss, at least in part, ofthe preferences which our exports at present -enjoy inEmpire markets. But the effect of such preferencesshould not be exaggerated. Between 1929 and 1937(both years of high world economic activity) the propor-tion of our exports which went to Empire markets rose,largely as a result of the Ottawa agreements, from44^ to 48 per cent. But this was also the period inwhich tariffs (such as the American Hawley-Smoottariff) and quantitative restrictions were imposed, orintensified all over the world; and although the propor-tion of our trade with the Empire rose, such was thetotal decline of our exports that this larger proportionof our exports represented a smaller absolute value.Our exports to Empire markets fell from  324 million in 1929 to  252 million in 1937.1.1. The United Kingdom tariff is of moderate height.We have to sell our exports in the United States andin many other overseas markets over much higherduties. A multilateral convention to reduce tariffsall round, but to reduce high tariffs more drasticallythan moderate tariffs, could greatly clear the obstacles to our exports without imposing on us any comparablereduction in our duties. To take but one example,between 1929 and 1937 (both years of high internalpurchasing power in the United States) the valueof our exports to the United States fell from  45-8 to 31-4 million or by 31 per cent.; and this must be largely ascribed to the Hawdey-Smoot tariff which was imposed in 1930, even though its excesses had in some respects been modified by Mr. HuH&apos;s Trade Agree-ments.12. But above all our exports suffered after 1930from the proliferation of import restrictions whichwere imposed on them in overseas markets. Morethan twenty countries before the war had imposedsuch restrictions on our exports, and these restrictionscovered the importation of many of our importantproducts into many of our important markets. our exports to a selection of countries (namely, Bulgaria,France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia,Poland, Roumania, Switzerland and Turkey) which from about 1931 onwards applied restrictions of widescope to our exports, fell in value between 1929 and1937 by no less than 38-1 Per cent. (More evidence ofthe effect of the Washington proposals on our exportopportunities is provided in paragraphs 23 to 26 of w.P. (44) 75.)13. In return for this clearance of barriers against our exports, our freedom to protect particular industries and occupations in this country would, ofcourse, be circumscribed. Any discussions about&quot; action directed towards the reduction of tariffs andother trade barriers &quot; which did not imply this would,of course, be a mere farce. Nevertheless, theproposals discussed at Washington leave reasonableelbow room for the protection of particular interests.First, there is no proposal to eliminate tariffs. Andthe tariff proposals which we can seriously discuss all have one thing in common; they involve, a more radical cut in high than in low tariffs. We would berequired to cut our tariffs less than other countries with high tariffs, and we would be able to impose newtariffs or to revise existing tariffs on anything whichwe wished to protect, up to a certain moderate&quot; floor.&quot; Secondly (although, as explained in 17 (iii)below, agreement has not yet been reached on thistopic with the Americans), our officials at Washingtonhave insisted that the freedom to pay direct andundisguised subsidies to any particular industry mustbe preserved.14. There seems to have, been some misunder-standing about the implications of the proposals on
State-trading, which were accepted by the Americanofficials at Washington. These proposals do nothinder us or any other country from monopolising thewhole of its foreign trade or from conducting a mixedsystem of State-trading in certain commodities and private trade in others. No country would be debarred from introducing greater stability into its internationalcommerce by means of long-term State-contracts forits imports or exports. On the other hand, an attempthas been made to avoid the use &quot;of State-tradingmechanisms merely to re-introduce by another means the protective and discriminatory mechanisms whichare to be barred under other clauses of the convention.The Washington proposals do not attempt to judgebetween State enterprise, private enterprise, or mixedsystems of trading; they try merely to set some limit to the protective and discriminatory use of each ofthese systems.15. The Washington proposals do suggest that countries should not set up State-trading monopoliesmerely in order to cover their trade with a State-trading country, when no State monopoly is set upto cover their trade in the same commodities with private enterprise countries. This is a limited issue which it might be wise to treat separately from themain issue (see paragraph 17 (vi) below).16. It may be useful to see how these arrangements would circumscribe our policjr for any particular industry for example, agriculture:  (i) Quantitative   restrictions   on   our   imports   ofagricultural&apos; products would be ruled out asa normal means of agricultural protection,though they could be employed during the transitional period, during periods of severe strain on our balance of payments, or as partof an international commodity arrangement.(ii) Moderate   tariff  protection   up   to  a   limitedad valorem level would be permissible on anyproducts.(iii) Direct subsidies, with or without such limitedtariff protection, would be permissible to anunlimited extent, if the view put forward by our officials at Washington were to prevail.The American officials wished to set somelimit to the subsidisation of commodities in world surplus supply. If the compromise solution suggested in 17 (iii) below were adopted, we would be under an obligationto enter into ad hoc discussions in each caseon the possibility of limiting such subsidisa-tion but would retain our ultimate right tocontinue what subsidies we considered necessary.(iv) Schemes  involving  a   levy   on   imports,   the proceeds of which are payable as a subsidy to home production, would be allowedprovided that the levy did not exceed the levelpermitted by the tariff rule.(&apos;)(v) The   trade   in    any    commodity    could   bemonopolised by the State.Subject to a satisfactory solution of the subsidy issue,the proposals would thus allow protection to any degree, provided that any protection in excess of thelevel permitted by the tariff rules was given by meansof subsidy. They would, moreover, permit (whetherby means of levy-subsidy arrangements or by State-trading arrangements) the payment of guaranteed prices to any agricultural product, provided again thatany protection in excess of the margin set by the tariffrules was given not by raising the price to theconsumer but by means of a direct charge on theExchequer.(!) If, for example, the rule suggested tentatively by our officials at Washington were accepted, this would permit inall cases a levy up to 10 per cent. No levy above 25 per cent,would be permitted in any case. The basis of treatment ofnew duties or levies between those two levels has still to bedetermined.IIT.-r-Questions Requiring Further cabinet decision.17. If the general line of commercial policy discussed at Washington is to be considered further, first in theforthcoming discussions with experts from theDominions and subsequently in further discussions with the Americans, it will be necessary for the Cabinetto give some guidance to our officials on a number of points. General Ministerial guidance on these mattersis necessary. But precise decisions would be out ofplace since at the next stage of official discussions withthe Americans frequent reference by officials to ministers will certainly be necessary as these questionnaire raised in the discussions.(i) Transitional Arrangements. It is necessary toconsider whether arrangements for the transi-tional period on the lines indicated in para-graphs 2-8 above should be put forward by theUnited Kingdom officials,(ii) Tariffs and. Preferences. American officials atWashington made it clear that a reallydrastic reduction of the American tariffwould be out of the question except in returnfor what would amount to the virtual abolition -t-ion of Imperial Preferences. It is forconsideration whether, as a means of fulfill-ing our obligations under Article VII, a tariffceiling of (say) twenty-five per cent, (or an equally drastic reduction of high tariffsachieved by alternative means) would justifythe practical elimination of imperial preference. The final fulfilment ofArticle VII might be achieved in two stageson both sides; in this case, it is for considera-fcion whether, as the first stage, we shouldcontemplate a somewhat more - moderatereduction of high tariffs in return for a lessdrastic cut in Imperial Preferences.(iii) Subsidies. The American officials at Washing-ton agreed in principle to the abolition of export subsidies. But they maintained that,in the case of commodities in world surplussupply (such as wheat and cotton), they couldnot do so unless some limit were also set tothe subsidisation of production of these com-modities in other countries. The UnitedKingdom officials maintained that the rightto subsidise total production should not belimited. The same divergence of view-revealed itself in the Washington talks oncommodity arrangements. (See paragraph 7 (e)of Annex C of this report.) A solution might perhaps be found on the following lines:  in the case of commodities declared bysome agreed procedure to be in world sur-plus supply, the rule against export subsidies would lapse unless an -ad hocagreement were reached to limit subsidies on production. Such an arrangement wouldenable us to retain the ultimate right to subsidise our home production as much aswe considered necessary, but would restrain the payment of export subsidies on mostmanufactured goods (such as the pre-warGerman subsidies from which our exporttrade suffered severely). .&apos; ^(iv) Infant Industries and Industries Necessary i&apos;-&apos;&apos;Grounds of Security. The American officialsargued that any protection required by such industries, additional to that permitted underthe tariff rules, should be provided by subsidies. The acceptance of the obligations of the convention by undeveloped countries would, however, be considerably eased if somehigher level of tariff protection were per-mitted in these cases. For this reason, &quot;might be wise to devise a properly sate- .guarded tariff exception, which in the case oiinfant industries would be of a temporarycharacter.
1&quot;$he Position of Non-Member States. -CanadianIofficials in the talks held in London last june and American officials in the recent talks A.M Washington have urged that the tariffII benefits of the proposed convention should not be extended to those countries which[I were not willing themselves to accept theI same obligations. In order to induce as many countries as possible to adhere to the comvention this would probably be as wise as itis equitable. In the case of an Empire1 country which did not participate, there would have to be changes in the treatmentI of its trade which would ensure that it was certainly not more favourably, and probablyless favourably,  treated than that of par-participating Empire countries. If this contin-gency should arise, the matter would clearly have to be dealt with by some, sort ofmodus vivendi.(vi) Counter-Monopoly for Trade with B,ussia.-the americans at Washington urged that State-trading monopolies should not be set upmerely to monopolise that part of a country&apos;?trade which was undertaken with another state-trading country (though they fullyadmitted the right of any country tomonopolise its trade with all other countrieseither for particular commodities or for allcommodities). This is an issue which will come up shortly for Ministerial decision in another connection.annex c.commodity policy.Majesty&apos;s Government is bound by no exactents in regard to Commodity Policy.

No especial attention was given toj terns of the transition.The problems of transition which have hithertoISsre of two kinds. In the first place, there arein war metals copper and aluminium are the[26868]leading examples of which surplus supplies arecertain to emerge at a very early date. In the caseof these commodities it is urgent that departments should, have some guidance as to the long-runobjectives of Government policy, and should be in aposition to give some guidance in turn to the interests concerned. Otherwise arrangements might easily bemade which would prove to run counter to the general international policy which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentdesires to see adopted in this field, but would provevery difficult to undo. Thus, in the case of copper theproducing interests, if they had to be left without any indication of His Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs attitude,might well consider that the only feasible way ofdealing with their problem would be by means-of regulation scheme on the pre-war pattern, a schemewhich, while introduced to deal with a temporaryemergency, might nevertheless easily tend to take ona permanent character. As is explained below (7 (c)),quantitative regulation of output is not excluded, inthe joint statement framed at Washington, as apossible remedy for conditions of over-supply, inappropriate cases and under appropriate conditions.But the knowledge that His Majesty&apos;s Government are disposed to treat it as a last rather than a first resortwould give a lead to the Departments concerned to explore alternative methods of dealing with thesituation (e.g., the freezing of Government-owned,stocks of metal so as to clear the outlets-for. new production) and to discuss them with producers.5. Secondly, there are two commodities-rubber and sugar which are still in acutely short supply but which claim attention for another reason. Each ofthem is the subject of a pre-war regulation agreement which is just about to expire; and in each case thequestion has arisen whether to renew the agreement as it stands, or to work for the establishment of abroadly-based international committee which, for thetime being, would confine itself to intelligence andstatistical activities, but which might be expected todevelop later into a policy-forming body. These deci-sions are having to be taken as a matter of urgencyin an attempt to keep the situation fluid pending the formulation of long-range Government policy in this field; but if our representatives on the bodies dealingwith these commodities are to function effectively, itwill be necessary for them to receive guidance at nodistant date as to what that policy is.6. Other instances of each of these two groups ofcases are likely to emerge during the transitional years.It would seem that the sooner an agreed body of principles can be approved, and the sooner a centralinstitution can be set up to which existing regulationschemes or their more flexible successors can beaffiliated, the less troublesome these problems will beto handle.
State-trading, which were accepted by the Americanofficials at Washington. These proposals do nothinder us or any other country from monopolising thewhole of its foreign trade or from conducting a mixedsystem of State-trading in certain commodities and private trade in others. No country would he debarred from introducing greater stability into its internationalcommerce by means of long-term State-contracts forits imports or exports.

But precise decisions would beplace since at the next stage of official discussiothe Americans frequent reference by officMinisters will certainly be necessary as these qi.are raised in the discussions.(i) Transitional Arrangements.

The     final     fulfilmentArticle VII might be achieved in two!on both sides; in this case, it is for co:tion whether, as the first stage, we contemplate   a   somewhat   more - inreduction of high tariffs in return fordrastic cut in Imperial Preferences.(iii) Subsidies. The American officials at Wton agreed in principle to the aboliexport subsidies.   But they maintain in the case of commodities in worldsupply (such as wheat and cotton), theHnot do so unless some limit were alscgthe subsidisation of production of themodifies  in   other   countries.    The.Kingdom officials maintained that thflto subsidise total production should Hlimited.     The   same   divergence   ofrevealed itself in the Washington taflcommodity arrangements. (See paragragof Annex C of this report.)   A solutioriperhaps be found on the following lirHIn the case of commodities declarlsome agreed procedure to be in workplus   supply,   the   rule   against IBsubsidies   would  lapse   unless  an (idagreement were reached to limit subon production.   Such an arrangementsenable us to retain the ultimate rig.subsidise our home production as muwe considered necessary, but would resthe payment of export subsidies onmanufactured goods (such as the pr(German subsidies from which our e:trade suffered severely).(iv) Infant Industries and Industries NecessarGrounds of Security. The American ;ofTargued that any protection required by-industries, additional to that permitted tthe tariff rules, should be provided!subsidies. The acceptance of the obbgajof the convention by undeveloped coup,would, however, be considerably easedHHhigher level of tariff protection weremitted in these cases. For this remight be wise to devise a properguarded tariff exception, which in the.infant industries would be of a techaracter.
(v) The Position of Non-Member States. Canadianofficials in the talks held in London last june and American officials in the recent talks atWashington have urged that the tariffbenefits of the proposed convention shouldnot be extended to those countries whichwere not willing themselves to accept thesame obligations. In order to induce as many countries as possible to adhere to the con-vention this would probably be as wise as itis equitable. In the case of an Empirecountry which did not participate, therewould have to be changes in the treatmentof its trade which would ensure that it was certainly not more favourably, and probablyless  favourably,  treated  than  that  of par-participating Empire countries. If this contin-gency should arise, the matter would clearly have to be dealt with by some, sort ofmodus vivendi.(vi) Counter-Monopoly for Trade with Russia. -the americans at Washington urged that State-trading monopolies should not be set upmerely to monopolise that part of a country&apos;strade which was undertaken with another state-trading country (though they fullyadmitted the right of any country tomonopolise its trade with all other countrieseither for particular commodities or for allcommodities). This is an issue which will come up shortly for Ministerial decision in another connection.ANNEX C.COMMODITY POLICY.1. His Majesty &apos;s Government is bound by no exactcommitments in regard to Commodity Policy. It istrue that Point 4 of the Atlantic Charter states thatthe United States and the United Kingdom &quot; will endeavour, with due respect for their existing obligations, to further the enjoyment by all states great and small, victor or vanquished, of access on equal terms to the trade and to the rawmaterials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity.&quot;Apart, however, from certain discriminatory duties ontin exports from Malaya and Nigeria and (for atemporary period) on palm oil exports from Nigeria,there were no discriminatory sales of primary products in the inter-war period from the United Kingdom and territories under its control. In general, therefore,this clause can only relate to the desirability of avoiding such discriminatory arrangements in regardto finance and commerce as may make it more difficult for some countries to acquire the foreign exchangenecessary to purchase the primary products they use.Commodity Policy, as such, is not affected by the atlantic Charter save in so far as it rules outdiscriminatory sales in the future.2. There are, however, certain indirect commit-ments. Article VII obliges us to seek measuresconducive to general economic expansion; it may beheld, therefore, that we are under some obligation to seek for an international code in respect of commodity policy, which would facilitate the achievement of thisgoal. Moreover, the recommendations of the HotSprings Conference, which have been accepted inprinciple by His Majesty&apos;s Government, contain aresolution on Commodity Policy suggesting, it is true in very general terms, the creation of an international commodity organisation and the outline of a code ofrules on which Commodity Policy might be based. no precise obligation is implied in all this, but inasmuch as arrangements made or contemplated in regard toimportant commodities entering international trade/ &quot;nay directly affect general measures for economicV expansion, it is incumbent on us to consider what our general policy should be in regard to such arrange-ments and to ensure that it does not conflict with thobroad objects of Article VII.I. The Transitional Period.3. In so far as they related, to Commodity Policy,the discussions at Washington were concernede-cmsively with the outline of a possible permanent settlement. No especial attention was given to problems of the transition.4. The problems of transition which have hithertoarisen are of two kinds. In the first place, there arecertain war metals copper and aluminium are the[26808]leading examples of which surplus supplies arecertain to emerge at a very early date. In the caseof these commodities it is urgent that departments should have some guidance as to the long-runobjectives of Government policy, and should be in aposition to give some guidance in turn to the interests concerned. Otherwise arrangements might easily bemade which would prove to run counter to the general international policy which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentdesires to see adopted in this field, but would provevery difficult to undo. Thus, in the case of copper theproducing interests, if they had to be left without any indication of His Majesty&apos;s Governments, attitude,might well consider that the only feasible way ofdealing with their problem would be by means ,o.f regulation scheme on the pre-war pattern, a schemewhich, while introduced to deal with a temporaryemergency, might nevertheless easily tend to take ona permanent character. As is explained below (7 (c)),quantitative regulation of output is not excluded, inthe joint statement framed at Washington, as apossible remedy for conditions of over-supply, inappropriate cases and under appropriate conditions.But the knowledge that His Majesty&apos;s Government are disposed to treat it as a last rather than a first resortwould give a lead to the Departments concerned to explore alternative methods of dealing with thesituation (e.g., the freezing of Government-ownedstocks of metal so as to clear the outlets for new production) and to discuss them with producers.5. Secondly, there are two commodities rubber and sugar which are still in acutely short supply but which claim attention for another reason. Each ofthem is the subject of a pre-war regulation agreement which is just about to expire; and in each case thequestion has arisen whether to renew the agreement as it stands, or to work for the establishment of abroadly-based international committee which, for thetime being, would confine itself to intelligence andstatistical activities, but which might be expected todevelop later into a policy-forming body. These deci-sions are having to be taken as a matter of urgencyin an attempt to keep the situation fluid pending the formulation of long-range Government policy in this field; but if our representatives on the bodies dealingwith these commodities are to function effectively, itwill be necessary for them to receive guidance at nodistant date as to what that policy is.      &apos;6. Other instances of each of these two groups ofcases are likely to emerge during the transitional years.It would seem that the sooner an agreed body of principles can be approved, and the sooner a centralinstitution can be set up to which existing regulationschemes or their more flexible successors can beaffiliated, the less troublesome these problems will beto handle.
II. The Long-TErm Arrangements.7. The long-term arrangements proposed are com-paratively straightforward and are succinctly set forth in the agreed statement itself. There are certainsalient features, however, which perhaps deservespecial mention :  (a) The Constitution.The principal organ of the international commodityorganisation would be a general commodity council,operating for purposes of day-to-day business through a general executive. - Votes in the council would be allocated among members on an appropriate basis,account being taken of their share in international trade.Control of particular commodities would be devolvedon individual commodity7 organisations, and it wouldbe a fundamental principle that, in the composition of any such organisations, &quot; countries largely depen-dent upon imports of supplies of the particularcommodity in question should&apos; have a combined voteequal to the exporting countries.&quot;(b) Obligation of Participating States.Under the agreement proposed, participating states would retain the right of final decision regardingproposed international commodity arrangements. Theorganisation would help to form such arrangements,and would review and report upon them before theywere submitted to Governments for conclusion. TheGovernments would undertake that any arrangementsnot so initiated should be communicated in full detail to the international organisation. But in the lastanalysis they would retain freedom of action.(c) Types of Policy.- Provision is made in the agreed statement both forbuffer stock arrangements and for quantitative regulation. It is agreed that the latter is to beregarded as a &quot;transitory&quot; expedient, &quot;to be intro-duced only where there is persisting disequilibriumbetween supply and demand which may necessitatespecial measures for the protection of producers andthe facilitation of orderly change.&quot; It is agreed that,where quantitative regulation of exports or production is proposed, there should be special safeguards in orderto ensure that the fundamental objectives of inter-national Commodity Policy are not infringed.(i) Equal  representation   of  producers  and   con-sumers.(ii) Eull exploration of alternative measures fordealing with the root causes of thedisequilibrium between supply and demand.- (iii) The obligation to make provision for increasingopportunities for supplying world require-ments from the centres of low-cost produc-tion.(iv) No quantitative regulation scheme to be approved for more than five years, or to be renewed save upon endorsement by thegeneral executive that the above principles,particularly those at (iii), have been observed.It is not possible to predict at this stage what wouldbe the relative importance of the different types of policies permitted. It became clear in the course ofthe discussion that differences of opinion on this sub-ject related much more to differences of view on theprospects of the commodity markets than to differences of view on the ultimate principles involved. If weadopted the proposed agreement we should be free to argue each case on its merits. And we should be assured that, if circumstances compelled us to admit that there was justification for quantitative regula-tion, this would take place under conditions in which,as consumers, we had adequate representation, andwere subject to the safeguard that artificial arrange-ments permanently protecting high-cost productionwere ruled out.(d) Relation with the Permanent Organisation for food and Agriculture.It is proposed that the Permanent Organisation for food and Agriculture should be organically linked withthe international commodity organisation by repre-sentation on some Government body.(e) Subsidies.There is a difference of view regarding subsidies. -The Americans suggest that where subsidies were allowed in respect of commodities suitable for inter-national regulation, they should be accompanied byquantitative limits on the amount of subsidised pro-duction. This cuts across our proposals regardingCommercial Policy, where the use of the subsidy as asafety-valve is one of the main principles of the scheme.This is the one outstanding point of difference between ourselves and the Americans at the moment. And itis probable that the Americans, who wish in this wayto reduce their own commitments as regards subsidies,will press us hard. A possible line of compromise issuggested in paragraph 17 (iii) of Annex B of thisreport.III. Questions Requiring Further cabinet decision.8. Before the matter can be further pursued, in conversations with the Dominions and perhaps, at alater stage, with the Americans, certain broaddecisions by Ministers are required. The following arethe main questions on which such decisions arenecessary :  (a) Do Ministers consider that having regard, onthe one had, to the broad issues of policy involved, and, on the other, to our responsi-bility for Colonial producers -the mainapproach in the paper to commodity arrange-ments should be the broad objective of HisMajesty&apos;s Government? In other words, areDepartments to operate in the knowledge that His Majesty&apos;s Government would wishquantitative regulation schemes to be avoided except as a last resort to deal with aposition of persisting disequilibrium betweensupply and demand, and then to be made subject to the safeguards indicated in thestatement of principles?(b) If the answer to (.a) is in the affirmative, canDepartments, if necessary, indicate to par-ticular industries in general terms that HisMajesty&apos;s Government&apos;s general policy is onthe lines indicated?(c) Should we work towards the ultimate establish-ment of an international commodity organisa-tion on the lines indicated in the statementof principles?.(d) If an international commodity organisation is established, are Ministers prepared to agreethat His Majesty&apos;s Government should acceptthe obligation to refer to it for scrutiny andreport any commodity schemes to which ther .or their nationals may be parties or may hav.become parties?(c) What line is to be adopted in regard to thesubsidy question? Would a compromise onthe lines suggested in the section on commercial Policy be acceptable?(/) Is it agreed that there should be created the link proposed between the international commodity organisation and the permanent organisation for Food and Agriculture?
ANNEX D.CARTEL POLICY.1. The American officials at Washington raised theproblem of international cartel agreements. There are important sections of American official opinion whichenjoy and, even with a change of Administration,would probably continue to enjoy the support of congress and of public opinion, which feel very strongly about the need to restrain the anti-socialpractices of international cartels. Some of theevidence which the American officials put before our officials on this subject was impressive in itself; andit is difficult to find an answer to the American argu-ment that we should not permit private producers ormerchants, by private and uncontrolled agreements, toreintroduce those obstacles to the flow of trade whichit is proposed to limit or to outlaw by government action under the Commercial Policy arrangements.2. Our own officials had no instructions on thissubject and were, therefore, compelled to adopt apassive role and to listen to the American proposals.These proposals go considerably beyond the meresuggestion that international cartel arrangements should, by international agreement, be subject to registration with some international body. Theyenvisage rather an elaborate code of rules for theoutlawing of many cartel practices. It is very doubtful whether we should wish at any rate to go asfar as the Americans in this policy. We have still todecide where our interest lies. Can we hope to gain by the maintenance of the price of some of our exports and by the protection of some of our markets whichcartel agreements may bring us? Or would such agreements tend rather to be too restrictive for a country which must be free by one means or anotherto expand the volume of its exports perhaps some50 per cent, above the pre-war level? Can we hopesuccessfully to resist American pressure for an anti-cartel policy and, at the same time, to maintain apolicy directed against restriction schemes for the primary products&apos; which we import ?3. Our answers to these questions must, no doubt,depend largely upon the internal policy which weadopt generally in regard to restrictive practices in industry, and which Ministers have now under con-sideration. In particular, do internal cartel arrange-ments, by organising large-scale production and bypreventing unnecessary price competition among ourexporters, help to promote the value of our exporttrade ? Or do they, by maintaining the cost of the materials and components of our manufacturedexports, impair our competitive position?4. We need much factual information before we candecide these issues. The President of the Board ofTrade is already; I understand, carrying out an enquiry on these lines, and, in the light of the facts which are thus disclosed, we must decide what line ofpolicy to adopt. In any case, we must not deceive our-selves about the importance of this^ topic if we wish toreach agreement with the Americans on the wide range of international economic problems. If we show unduereluctance to enter, at the appropriate time, into further discussion on international cartels, we run grave risk of prejudicing further progress in the fields ofCommercial Policy and Commodity Policy.ANNEX E.EMPLOYMENT POLICY.1. This also was a subject which the Americansraised, and since the broad lines of our own internalpolicy for the maintenance of employment was at thattime still undecided, it was not possible for the UnitedKingdom officials to enter into any detailed exchangeof views on internal employment policies. However,the various specialised international economic institu-tions which have been proposed (such as the monetaryorganisation, the investment bank, the commodityorganisation and the commercial policy organisation)all may exercise an important influence over general economic expansion throughout&apos;the world, and so overthe opportunities for employment, in the various countries of the world. Apart from this, the internalpolicies of the major countries of the world .through their success or failure to maintain a high level of-nternal economic activity, react in an important wayupon the opportunities for employment in othercountries.2- In effect, therefore, the international aspects ofemployment  policy  are  concerned  either  with  theco-ordination of the activities of other specialised inter-national institutions or with the provision of opportunities -ties for the exchange of views and information between countries on the different internal economic policies which they have pursued for the maintenance ofemployment. The Washington talks on this subjectconcentrated accordingly on the possibility of institu-ting, for this and kindred purposes, some central inter-national economic organisation, served by an economic advisory staff.3. It is probable that the Australians at the forth-coming Dominions talks will lay great emphasis, asthey did during the Dominions talks in London last june, on the need for international policy for the main-tenance of economic activity and employment. It is,therefore, necessary to decide whether the UnitedKingdom officials in forthcoming talks with theDominions should be authorised to pursue further thepossibility of a central international economic organisa-tion of this character.
ANNEX F.INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT.1. The Americans at Washington took the initiative in laying before our officials a draft project for aninternational bank to promote long-term internationalinvestments. This subject did not, however, form partof the official discussions at Washington, since theUnited Kingdom officials had no instructions on thesubject which was raised by the Americans onlytowards the end of our visit. The matter is, however,one which is closely allied . to the proposals for theinternational monetary organisation. It is also onewhich.might have considerable importance from our point of view. If the United States is destined tohave a very favourable balance of payments, it isimportant that she should match this with long-term capital movements to the countries most in need ofcapital development; and such lending would beabove all useful to us in so far as the principle couldbe accepted that the expenditure of long-term loansshould not be tied to the products of the lendingcountry. Moreover, any action which promoted the planning and timing of international investment insuch a way as to maintain economic activity at a stable level, might be of considerable use in a generalpolicy for the maintenance of economic activity andof employment. On the other hand, of course, itwould not be appropriate for a country in the positionof the United Kingdom, with the prospect of a difficultbalance of payments problem, to commit itself inadvance to provide any considerable funds for inter-national investment. It is for the countries with,favourable balances to lend abroad.2. Whether or not the American proposals allow for,&apos;or cquld be made to allow for, these principles, is amatter for expert consideration. Indeed, the whole subject requires technical consideration at the official level before Ministerial decisions can usefully bereached upon it. But the topic has already been raised by the Americans arid is likely to be raised bythem again; and it is one in which we have a vitalinterest at stake. I would, therefore, propose thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer should be invited toarrange for an examination of the American proposals by the Treasury in consultation with the otherDepartments primarily concerned and to report upon them to the Cabinet.
