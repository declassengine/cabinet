THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 73.3rd February, 1944.WAR CABINET.LONDON AIRFIELD FOR TRANSPORT SERVICES.Report by the Lord President of the Council.Introductory.1. The War Cabinet at their meeting on 1st November (W.M. (43) 148thConclusions, Minute 4) invited the following : Lord President of the Council (in the Chair);Chancellor of the Exchequer;Minister of Production;Lord Privy Seal;Secretary of State for Air;Minister of Health;Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries;Minister of War Transport;Minister of Town and Country Planning; and paymaster General;to consider and report on the proposal made by the Secretary of State for Air forthe establishment of a new airfield near London capable of accommodating heavytransport aircraft of the latest type.2. We held a meeting on the 10th November, at which we considered thematter on the basis of the Memoranda by the Secretary of State for Air (W.P.(43) 482) and the Minister of Health (W.P. (43) 490) and Memoranda by theMinister of War Transport and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.* Asa result of this meeting, we submitted a report to the War Cabinet on the12th November (W.P. (43) 517). The report included a recommendation thatthe Air Ministry should be authorised to proceed with Stage 1 of the Heath RowScheme, subject to certain assurances, one of which was that none of the factories which would have to be dislodged were of special importance from the point ofview of production.3. At this stage, however, considerable difficulty was found in finding-alternative accommodation to Fairey&apos;s Works on the Heath Row site. This ledto some delay. Later, it became necessary for us to hold a further meeting onthe 27th January. On this occasion we had before us a further Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Air (W.P. (44) 32) and a Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Scotland (W.P. (43) 530), and we somewhat modified the conclusions reached at the earlier meeting. The present report supersedes our earlier report(W.P. (43) 517) and embodies as much of it as is now relevant.The Heath Row Scheme: and What it Involves.4. The Secretary of State for Air&apos;s proposal to construct a modern airfield at Heath Row, near Staines, is put forward, in the first instance, to meet thewar-time requirements, immediate and future, of Transport Command, but also as providing an airfield which could be developed as an international civilairport for the capital of the Empire after the War.5.   The project is a large one.Stage 1 (which gives runways of 3,000, 2,000 and 2,000 yards) takesfourteen months to complete and costs  5 million. It involves demolishing130 houses and 8 factories; only two of the latter are of special importance from the point of view of war production, and for these special arrange-ments for transfer have been agreed with the Departments concerned.* These were printed as Annexes &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; to W.P. (43) 517.[268501
Stage 2 (which gives runways of 5,000, 3,000 and 3,000 yards) costs an extra  2f million and involves demolishing 58 more houses and four morefactories. More serious, it would involve the removal of the MiddlesexCounty Council sludge disposal works. These were built shortly before thewar.   They took two years to complete and cost  500,000.Stage 3 would cost yet a further  15-i million and would involve thedemolishing of nearly 1,400 houses and other buildings.6. Stage 1 of the scheme also means taking over 1,000 acres of land now-used to grow vegetables. The total annual value of crops produced fromagricultural land in Stage 1 area is  625,000. The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries points out that the amount of land in the near neighbourhood of Londonsuitable for growing fresh vegetables has already been greatly encroached on and.that further encroachments are threatened. He has asked that the Air ministry should examine whether, if the Heath Row scheme is proceeded with, they cannotgive up Heston or other airfields in the London area; the Air Ministry havereplied that, so far as can be foreseen, they should be able to give up two Londonairfields (500 acres in all) immediately after the war, but that it is not as yet-possible to say whether or not Heston will be required.7. From the transport point of view the scheme would also add substantial sums to the cost of the by-pass or arterial roads planned in the neighbourhood.The Ministry of War Transport take the view, however, that this additional cost would form part of the cost of a comprehensive improvement of the main routes to the West and South-West, the need for Avhich is already apparent.8. &apos; Construction of this airfield would require 2,000 men at the beginningof Stage 1, rising later to 3,000 men. This does not include the labour requiredfor re-housing displaced civilians, or reconstructing the sludge works, and so forth. If the scheme is started now, it will, of course, add to the strain on resources already severely stretched.The Case on Military Grounds.9. The case, on military grounds, for proceeding now with Stages 1 and 2of the Heath Row Scheme rests on the fact that transport aircraft requiring arunway of 3,000 yards are already in operational use, and that aircraft requiringrunways of 5,000 yards will be in use in 1946. The United States Authoritiesare already building airfields of this size. Even if it is assumed that in 1946Germany will have been defeated but we shall still be at war with Japan, therewill be a military requirement in 1946 for an airfield in this country capableof taking the large transport aircraft which will then be in use.10. We have considered whether any other airfields could be extended to5,000 yards more quickly and more economically than Heath Row. There arein this country a number of airfields with runways of 3,000 yards, but nearly all of them are required for operational purposes and none of them is near London.The airfields at present used for large transport aircraft are Lyneham,St. Mawgan and Prestwick. Only Prestwick is capable of extension to providerunways of 5,000 yards and the construction work would be very extensive and costly, and would take as long, if not longer, than the completion of Stage 2 atHeath Row.11. We are satisfied that, on military grounds, there is a case for givingauthority now to proceed with Stages 1 and 2 of the Heath Row Scheme so as toprovide an airfield with a runway of 5,000 yards in 1946. Our only doubtconcerns the question whether it will be possible to remove the sludge disposal yworks from the Heath Row site in time to enable the airfield to be completed by1946. We have invited the Minister of Health to obtain an expert opinion onthis, as a matter of urgency. Provided their opinion is favourable, we recommendthat authority should now be given to proceed with Stages 1 and 2.The Civil Air Transport Case.12. London will certainly need a modern civil airport after the War. but should it be at Heath Row ? And how much work on it need be done during thewar ?13. Heath Row is well situated from the point of view of both road and rail transport into London, although substantial new construction would be needed togive really good road and rail access from the centre. We are informed that, after
prolonged search, no other area can be found on which an airfield can be-builtcapable of accommodating the heaviest types of transport aircraft building or in contemplation, unless either recourse was had to very extensive demolition or the airfield was to be much further away from London.14. In our view, the claims of Heath Row to be adopted as the site for thefuture international airport of London are very strong indeed. We feel justifiedin recommending approval, in principle, to the development of the Heath Rowsite as a main terminal airport. Until work can start on Stage 3, the whole siteshould be sterilised from further development. We have invited the Minister of town and Country Planning to see that this is done.15. The Secretary of State for Scotland has expressed the hope that theHeath Row proposals will in no way prejudice the development of Prestwickafter the war as a major international airport. The Air Ministry have repliedthat an international airport in the North must be provided, but that the high cost of developing Prestwick to the necessary extent may mean that some othersite will be selected.Conclusions.16. Our conclusions, which are agreed by all the Ministers concerned andwhich we now report to the War Cabinet, are as follows : (i) Subject to the conditions set out below, the Air Ministry should beauthorised to proceed with work on Stages 1 and 2 of the Heath RowScheme at an estimated cost of  7f million,(ii) This recommendation is subject to the labour required being madeavailable from the allocation for building labour made to the AirMinistry, and to no special addition being asked for on account of theHeath Row Scheme. This proviso is accepted by the Secretary of Statefor Air.(iii) This authority is also subject, so far as Stage 2 is concerned, to theMinister of Health receiving a favourable report from the experts onthe time required to replace the Middlesex County Council&apos;s sludgedisposal works. We have agreed that any doubtful points arising outof the experts&apos; report should be settled by the Ministers directly concerned (the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of health and the Secretary of State for Air).(iv) Approval, in principle, should be given to the development of the HeathRow site as a main terminal airport for post-war civil air traffic.Authority for the Air Ministry to start work on Stage 3 of the scheme can be deferred for the present, but the Minister of Town and country planning has been invited to sterilise all the land required for thefull scheme.C.
