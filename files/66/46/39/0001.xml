His responsibility in this respect will in particular include ensuring that the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government are brought adequately to the noticeof the central combined organisations controlling subversive and political warfarethroughout the area of the Command, since it is impossible in the Balkans to drawany distinction between such warfare on the one hand and politics on the other.* The recognised abbreviation of this title, for use in telegraphic correspondence, isRESMIN.

Mr. Macmiilan will work in the closest contact with bis United Statesopposite number, establishing relations of complete co-operation and confidencewith him in order that as far as possible conflict of British and American viewson such questions and constant references by the Supreme Commander to the combined Chief s of Staff, who, even though the British Chiefs of Staff act as their executive, are the final arbiters in cases where there is disagreement, may be avoided.5. It is clearly impracticable to uproot from Cairo either the Greek orYugoslav Governments or His Majesty&apos;s Embassies attached thereto, or the organisations now established in the Middle East for dealing with administrative and economic questions arising in the territories specified in paragraph 1.Existing arrangements will therefore continue on much the same lines as atpresent, subject to such alterations as may be necessary to ensure (a) reference to General Wilson on issues which cannot be decided locally;(b) that Mr. Macmillan is placed in a position to make sure that the activitiesof the organisations remaining in the Middle East under the controlof the Minister Resident but dealing with territories within the allied commander-in-Chief&apos;s sphere, are conducted in accordance with thepolitical and economic policy of His Majesty&quot;s Government.The day-to-day conduct of these organisations will be the responsibility ofthe Minister Resident.

Both as regards Turkey and theremainder of the sphere of the Minister Resident, Middle East, and as regardsthe sphere of His Majesty&apos;s Representative with the French Committee ofNational Liberation, Mr. Macmillan should be kept informed of what is going on and arrangements be made by him for the appropriate interchange ofinformation.7.
