THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRIMAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 69.1st February, 1944.WAR CABINET.IRELAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THE War Cabinet considered in November last (W.P. (43) 150th Conclusions,Minute 2) a proposal by President Roosevelt to send a communication to Mr. de valera regarding the continued neutrality of Eire, and decided that a reply should be sent deprecating the despatch to Mr. de Valera of a communication on the lines proposed. The Foreign Secretary accordingly wrote to the UnitedStates Ambassador in this sense (W.P. (43) 589).A few days ago, the United States Ambassador came to see me to say thathe had a new proposition to put to me with regard to an American approach to Eire. He did not leave any written note with me, but, briefly, the proposal,which I understand emanates from the United States Minister in Dublin, is this.It is suggested that the United States Government should send a note to the eire Government, stating that the security of United States troops quartered inNorthern Ireland or crossing the Atlantic is at present gravely imperilled bythe presence in Eire of Axis Diplomatic Missions. The United States must therefore demand that these Missions should be cleared out. Mr. Gray&apos;sexpectation apparently is that this demand would meet with a negative reply,and the Eire Government would then be on record as having refused a requestwhich had the object of safeguarding the lives of American soldiers, sailors and airmen at a vital moment in the war. The Ambassador asked me what I thought of this proposal, and what I considered was likely to be the attitude of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to it. He outlined to me three alternative methods of approach to the Eire Government, on which his Government would be glad ofthe views of His Majesty&apos;s Government. They were (1) a note from the UnitedStates Government alone; (2) a joint Anglo-American note; and (3) separate butsimultaneous notes by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Govern-ment. Of these alternatives, I understood, the United States Minister in Dublinpreferred (1) and (3).I told the Ambassador that I could not, of course, answer for my colleagueswithout consulting them. But, speaking for myself and strictly off the record,I thought that the present proposal was not open to the same dangers as hisGovernments earlier one. I would take the matter up at once, and would communicate further with him when I was in a position to do so.There seems to me much to be said for agreeing to this new suggestion.It puts to the Eire Government a simple limited demand, and, though one cannotbe certain that the ingenious mind of Mr. de Valera will not find some means of attempting to cloud the issue by dragging in questions&apos;of wider policy, it is atleast doubtful that he will be able to do this with any success. It should therefore be possible for the United States Government and ourselves to limitdiscussion to the actual point at issue. On this basis, the approach could do no harm and might do considerable good. If Mr. de Valera agreed to sack the axis Missions, we should have achieved a valuable success. Although theGerman Minister in Dublin is probably not in a position to give his Governmentmuch useful information, he is a skilful and experienced diplomat, and, in anycase, it is intolerable that he should be there at all. If, on the other hand, as is\ most likely, Mr. de Valera refused the United States demand, he would puthimself very much in the wrong with the United States Government and, if it came out, with the American people. The Cabinefs anxiety over the earlierproposal of the President was lest it should give Mr. de Valera the chance of raising wider questions which might become the cause of friction between[26842]
Britain and the United States. For the reasons stated above, I do not see thesame dangers here.At the same time, it is, I think, desirable to consider the possible forms of reply which Mr. de Valera might make. A simple affirmative, which I regard as most unlikely, or a simple negative would present no difficulty. But he mightwell try to bring into his reply either (a) a statement that any such action would expose him to immediate attack from Germany and a consequent demand thathe should be given substantial military supplies to enable Eire to defend itselfagainst German attack, together possibly with substantial other supplies sothat Eire can be put on at least as favourable a footing as the Allied nations inregard to, e.g., oil and coal supplies, or (b) an argumentative reply raising the partition issue. The point at (a) would not, I imagine, present serious difficulty,but it would be necessary to consider very carefully how the matter should be handled if the reply took the form suggested at (b) above.I have since asked the United States Ambassador whether his Governmenthad in mind early publication of the suggested communications to Mr. cle valera and of Mr. de Valera&apos;s reply, should this prove to be negative. He said thathe could not give me an immediate answer, but promised to find out. This seemsto me a matter of some importance, as we are at present receiving considerable assistance from the Southern Irish Government, in matters of security, &amp;c. Inaddition, any public breach with the Southern Irish Government would be likelyto affect the position of the large numbers of workmen from Southern Irelandat present employed in war industries in this country. It seems .to me that, onthis aspect of the matter, the essential point would be to ensure that we were consulted when any question of publication arises.In addition, I should hope that we might be given an opportunity of considering and commenting on the reply received from the Eire government before the United States Government decided on replying to it or publishingit, in the event of Mr. de Valera raising such wider issues as Partition.As.between the three methods of approach outlined by the Ambassador, I am inclined to prefer the third. The first alternative, a note sent by the UnitedStates alone, seems open to the objection that it might appear to wide sections ofBritish public opinion to be am interference, by the United States, in the internal affairs of the British Empire. The second alternative, a joint Anglo-Americannote, would lend itself to interpretation by anti-British elements in America thatthe initiative was really a British one. It would thus lose much of its value fromthe point of view of propaganda in the United States. The third alternativeavoids these objections. The United States note would make it clear that theinitiative was theirs. The British note would state that we had been consulted and wrarmly welcomed the American step.To sum up. I suggest, for the consideration of the War Cabinet, that weshould reply to the United States Ambassador on the following lines : (a) We agree to the proposed approach by the United States Government to eire on the lines communicated to me by Mr. Winant, though weshould be glad to have an opportunity of commenting on the exact text.(b) Subject to any views which the United States Government may have, weconsider that the question of publishing the approach should be amatter for further consultation between the United States Governmentand ourselves.(c) In any case, we should hope that the United States Government would consult with us further when the Eire Government reply is received with regard to any further steps.(d) As regards the question of United Kingdom participation in the approach, we think that the best course would be that we should, atthe same time as the United States approach is made, send in aseparate note to the Eire Government to the effect that we had been consulted by the United States Government before their approach wasmade and that we warmly welcomed their initiative and supported the request wdaich they had decided to make to the Eire Government.Dominions Office, 1st February, 1944.
