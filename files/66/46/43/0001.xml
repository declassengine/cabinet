(44) 93. /8ih February, 1944. \^WAR CABINET.MORALE IN GERMANY.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE&apos;to my colleagues herewith a paper on morale in Germany,which brings up to date the information contained in W.P. (43) 527 of the22nd November, 1943. This paper represents the agreed views of the various departments concerned with this question, including the Service Departments.A. EForeign Office, 8th February, 1944.The year 1943 ended for Germany with increasingly severe set-backs. air raids upon German cities by day and by night have increased in intensity and reached a climax in the repeated mass attacks on Berlin. In the East the Sovietwinter campaign has allowed the German army no respite. The German navyhas suffered serious reverses in the sinking of the Scharnhorst, the defeat of theGerman destroyers in the Bay of Biscay, the continued failure of the U-boatcampaign and the break-down of the blockade-running programme for thisseason. The &quot; secret weapon &quot; on which high hopes have been placed has not yetmaterialised. The attitude of the satellite countries is causing anxiety. TheTehran Conference confirmed the lesson of Allied unity already learnt from theearlier Moscow Conference. The prospect of an Allied landing in the Westbecame a certainty.2. The only items on the credit side have been the failure of the russians to achieve any encirclement and destruction of the German forces on the scale of &quot; Stalingrad,&quot; the slow progress of the Allied campaign in Italy, and theGerman success in regaining control of the Dodecanese Islands. In addition,the Russian-Polish dispute has afforded to Germany&apos;s leaders the hope ofexploiting Allied dissension and to Dr. Goebbels some material for his campaign to show that Great Britain has given Europe over to Bolshevism.3. Though every endeavour has been made to conceal from the Germanpeople the true gravity of the situation, the Nazi leaders in their New Yearmessages admitted a black side to the picture in order to buttress their appeal for an even greater effort in the coming crucial year.4. The German retreat in the East and the prospect of invasion from theWest appear so far to be arousing surprisingly little attention amongst the people.This may be due partly to the fact that 1943 has to some extent immunisedthe civil population to shocks and partly to the widespread condition of apathyto which recent reports from inside Germany have referred with remarkableunanimity. There seems also to be developing an inclination to suspend judgment on the outcome of the war until invasion from the West has been attempted.There is good evidence that the German leaders in particular are staking every-thmg on repelling the invasion and thereby creating circumstances which theymay consider favourable for reaching a separate peace with either the soviet union or the West.12276   [26896]
, ; 5. Reference has been made in previous reports to friction betweenWehrmacht and Party. There have recently been indications that these two groups have now reached anyhow a temporary compromise, inspired on the partof the Army by a desire for maximum stability on the home front.6. The German propaganda machine has continued to work at full pressure to counter any belief that the results even of &apos;&apos; unconditional surrender &apos;&apos; might be preferable to present sufferings. The consequences of this propaganda are considerable and it remains one of the main reasons why German civilians feelthat, even though there may now be little hope of outright victory, it is still worthfighting on in the hope of some miraculous change in the fortunes of war.*7. For the average German of the bombed cities the immediate miseriesprobably loom larger even than the possible loss of the war. There is evidencethat air raids during the period under review have deadened morale in the areasaffected and have deepened apathy and fatalism elsewhere. Moreover their effect has been increased by the failure of the authorities to initiate the reprisals whichit had been hoped might lead to a cessation of the attacks. Circumstantial reports from Berlin comment on the apathy of the population, which prevented them from making any real attempt to put out fires except when their own property was involved. These reports told also of passive resentment at the ineffective relief-organisation of the party authorities, of large-scale absenteeism on the part ofthe employees from undamaged plants and of wide-spread looting. There are,indeed, indications of a general weakening of routine police control throughoutthe country, but this does not apply as regards the security services, which remainadequate to deal effectively with any disturbances which may occur in theimmediate future.   Organised risings remain impossible.8. The past year has seen a serious deterioration both in Germany&apos;s strategic position and in the conditions of life of the individual German. Total warfare,in the form of overwhelming air attacks and the stretching to the limit of Germanreserves of man-power and industry, is imposing a tremendous strain on theindividual German. It may be useful at this stage to consider what, in such circumstances, is apparently preventing the emergence of any serious threat tothe continued existence of the Nazi regime, which has been responsible for bringing about this state of affairs.9. The Generals form the group within Germany which is the strongestposition to bring pressure to bear upon the Nazi leaders. Industrial and-ecclesiastical circles would only support a move after it had been made. Thereare, however, many factors which have so far prevented the Generals from taking action. These include, inter alia, fear of denunciation, lack of agreedmeans, uncertainty as to the consequences of action, conflict of loyalties, politicalignorance and unwillingness to assume responsibility. Hitler and Himmler are reported to rate very low the chance of a Generals&apos; putsch.10. The majority of Germans are still unable to envisage any alternative to the Nazi regime. Direct revolutionary action is highly improbable. Thereis no subversive organisation, and the experience of the past years has inducedin the mass of the German people such a condition of physical, mental andnervous exhaustion that they are probably less capable now than ever before of taking the initiative. Of even greater importance in preventing action are thesecurity services, both because of their power to suppress any attemptedrevolution and even more perhaps because of their ability to stifle the thousands of individual discussions out of which any revolution must grow.11. There is, of course, a condition against which the machinery ofrepression is relatively ineffective : and that is when involuntarily, as a resultof progressive exhaustion, the mass of German people no longer produce insufficient quantities the goods and services without which war cannot be waged.There has been recent evidence that the Nazi leaders are becoming anxious about this progressive exhaustion, the existence of which is recognised in the highestpolice circles.* Certain Departments also hold the view that there is already evidence that the effect ofthis propaganda, though important, is decreasing in proportion as the present miseries of theGerman people grow. One department even considers that it has never had any materialinfluence at all, on the grounds that the German people are (1) so incapable of thinking thingsout for themselves and (2) so in the grip of the Gestapo that the possibility of not carrying ondoes not seriously occur to them.
12. The present Nazi leaders, unlike the leaders in 1918, dare not takethe initiative towards capitulation, both because they have more reason to fearthe consequences to themselves and because they have less sense of responsibilityfor the future of Germany after their fall. They will, therefore, probably carryon whatever happens until other potential leaders see more danger for them-selves and for Germany in remaining inactive than in overcoming the fears,scruples and difficulties which at present prevent their moving.13. Morale in the army generally continues on a remarkably high levelconsidering all the trials through which the German forces have passed. reports from Italy show quite conclusively that the German troops there are fightingextremely well, and some formations outstandingly so. As regards the German troops on the Russian front, it is clear that they must have been fighting well to produce the results which they have, notably in the Crimea and on the Southern flank of the Kiev salient, whilst a recent report by American generals who have visited the Kiev front described the German prisoners as &quot; young, clean and confident.&quot;We have no recent information on the subject but it is probable that the german forces of occupation in non-operational areas, such as Norway and parts ofTrance, are continuing to show the inevitable signs of boredom.14. As regards the German Air Force, evidence from the Russian frontremains deficient, but that from other theatres continues to indicate that therehas been some decline of morale and a slight weakening of fighting spirit.15. To judge from the bearing and fighting spirit of the 36 survivors fromthe Scharnhorst, the inactivity and segregation of the German surface fleet havenot led to any deterioration in the quality of their ship&apos;s companies. Whatgrievances they have appear to be normal and without political significance.Survivors from the destroyers sunk in the Bay of Biscay at the end of December1943 were in less good fettle. Though apathetic, they showed no signs ofdefeatism. They were, in fact, critical of their officers&apos; unenterprising tactics.In the fighting spirit of U-boat officers and men there is no change to report.They are becoming fully conscious of the odds against them, of the severecasualties they have suffered and of the poor results achieved in the last fewmonths. As prisoners, their petty officers and ratings show little faith inGermany&apos;s ability to avoid defeat.
