THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  January 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 52.25th January, 1944.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER ALLOCATIONS FOR INDUSTRIES AND SERVICES INGROUPS II AND III IN 1944.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.AT their discussion on the 1st December, 1943, the War Cabinet (W.M. (43)164th Conclusions) approved the scheme of allocation of man-power for 1944proposed by the Ministerial Committee in W.P. (43) 539, and invited me toarrange for detailed allocations to be settled, under the supervision of the ministerial Committee, for the industries and services in Groups II and IIIfor which detailed allocations had not already been made.2. The Ministerial Committee have obtained revised estimates of require-ments from the Departments mainly affected by the new assumption on whichman-power policy for 1944 is being framed (cf. paragraph 4 (a) of W.P. (43) 490).The total requirements far exceed the numbers available, under the WarCabinet&apos;s decision, for distribution among the remaining industries and services in Groups II and III; and it has not been possible for us to meet more than apart even of the revised demands. In the following paragraphs of thismemorandum I set out the numbers which we would allocate to each of these industries and services, and indicate some of the considerations which haveinfluenced us. We consider that this represents the best distribution that can bemade of the limited supplies available.Industries and Services in Group II.3. The total allocation made by the War Cabinet for Group II Industriesprovided a net increase of 83,000 in the first half of 1944 and a net increase of35,000 in the second half. Out of these totals, net increases amounting to 45,000in the first half of 1944 and 25,000 in the second half had already been allocated to coal mining, the Merchant Navy and inland transport. There remained netincreases of 38,000 in the first half and 10,000 in the second half to be allocated to the rest of the Group.4. Against this total of 48,000 to be allocated, the total requirementsamounted to 160,565.   The following table shows : (a) the requirements put forward by the Departments;(b) the result which would have followed had a pro raia reduction (to about one-third) been applied to these requirements;(c) the allocations which we recommend after taking as full account aspossible, within the limits imposed by the global total, of priorities and the various other factors involved; and(d) the division of these allocations between the first and second half of theyear.[26781]Copy No.8

We make the following recommendations in respect of particular items in the preceding table : (a) We have been unable to add more than 5,000 to the present &quot; ceiling &quot; of80,000 for the Women&apos;s Land Army, and we recommend, therefore,that any excess in the Women&apos;s Land Army at the end of 1943 abovethe &apos;&apos; ceiling &apos;&apos; of 80,000 then operating should be counted against their allocation for 1944. We hope that it may be possible to ease the position to some extent by the use of Italian prisoners of war, andwe suggest that the small allocation made to the Women&apos;s Land army should be taken into account when prisoners of war come to be allocated.(&amp;) We are informed that a. substantial proportion of the additionalindustrial staffs required by the Air Ministry is needed for main-tenance work on operational stations. On this account we recommendthat, in addition to the net increase of 6,000 proposed for 1944, anydeficit on the 1943 allocation should be made good.(c) A substantial part of the allocation proposed for food manufacture hasbeen assigned to the first half of the year, and we have, for the timebeing, disregarded demands relating to projects which will be under-taken mainly in the second half of 1944. We accordingly recommendthat food manufacture should be one of the industries to be givenparticular attention in the review of man-power allocations to beundertaken in May 1944.(d) We have not suggested separate allocations for each of the threeclaimants for non-industrial staffs. We think it preferable thatdetailed arrangements for the distribution of the joint allocation of11,500 should be worked out between the Treasury and the Depart-ments concerned. We do, however, suggest that, in making these arrangements, the Foreign Office demand for 10,000 persons for reliefadministration should be substantially reduced.
I9Industries and Services in Group III.6. The man-power allocations to industries and services in Group III, as recommended by the Ministerial Committee and approved by the War Cabinet,were as follows : &apos;First half(Thousands.) of the year.Net Increases  ...      ...       -I- 15Net Reductions ...       -126Second halfof the year.+ 10-55Total..-t- 25-181The War Cabinet assented, however, to a proposal by the President of theBoard of Trade that, in working out the man-power requirements of theGroup III industries, he should be at liberty to propose a larger net increasebalanced by a larger net release. We have, therefore, felt it necessary to acceptthe requests of the President of the Board of Trade for larger net increases incertain industries. On the other hand, we have had to consider the prior claims in Group III of the nursing and hospital services; and we could not recommendthat the man-power budget should be unbalanced by planning for largerincreases than the available supply of labour could offer. Besides allowing for increases in certain of the industries and services in Group III, net reduc-tions among the Group III industries and services in general have also to providefor a large part of the increases allocated to the other two Groups, and to beara large part of the losses expected as a result of a decline in the industrial population. There is general agreement that it is possible to secure a verylarge part of the reductions in Group III industries and services needed to balance these requirements. But for each half of the year there is some uncertainty as to whether the whole gap can be closed.7. In our earlier report to the War Cabinet (W.P. (43) 539) we recom-mended that the man-power position should be reviewed in May 1944 and thatthe allocations proposed for the second half of the year should then bere considered. In particular, we pointed out that it may prove possible torecommend that during the second half of 1944 further labour should be madeavailable at the expense of some of the munitions industries, for industries and services supplying civilian needs. It is the industries and services in Group IIIwhich would be most affected by such a review, and we therefore recommendthat consideration of the possible deficiency in meeting the net increases requiredfor the second half of 1944 should be deferred until the review to be under-taken in May 1944. Accordingly, detailed net increases and net reductions setout below relate to the first half of 1944 only.8. Tor this period the Minister of Labour and National Service has under-taken to do his best to close the gap by endeavouring to extract from non-foodretail distribution and the clothing industry, and to make available to the otherindustries requiring net increases, somewhat larger numbers than it seemedprudent in the first instance to assume. On this basis, we recommend the follow-ing allocations :  Man-Power Allocations for the First Half of 1944 for Group IIIIndustries and Services.Thousands.Net increases.Nursing   and   hospitalservicesCotton   ...Other textilesLeather ...FootwearPaperRubber  ...MicaRefractoriesFurnitureLaundriesContingencies, includingrelief ...Thousands.+ 10 04-4-4-+++++++210-410-2 00-50-54-030+   4-3Total net increases     -l- 30-0Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,25th January, 1944.Net reductions.Building     and     civil engineering  ...Retail tradeLace      ...Leather goods ...ClothingHats and caps ...Woodworking ...PrintingGlassBuilding ancillariesInsuranceProfessions   and   otherservices1923 age class ...Total net reductions5045012507312022141 0J.
