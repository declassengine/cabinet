(44) 83.5th February, 1944. ;WAR CABINET.UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.THE formula of unconditional surrender was first used at Casablanca by thePresident and endorsed by the Prime Minister. It has subsequently beenaccepted as our first war aim and appears in the final &apos;&apos; Sextant &apos;&apos; Report* as the overall objective of the war.2. The President has already, to some extent, modified the uncompromisingcharacter of the phrase in a public announcement made by him on the24th December  &quot; The United Nations have no intention to enslave the German people.We wish them to have a normal chance to develop in peace as useful andrespectable members of the European family. But we must emphasise theword &apos; respectable &apos; for we intend to rid them once and for all of Nazism andPrussian militarism and the fantastic and disastrous notion that they con-stitute the &apos; Master RaceHe added in a telegram to the Prime Minister! that he thought it better notto go beyond that at the present time. The1 Prime Minister has circulated a paper on this subject.:):3. At Teheran, Marshal Stalin is understood to have expressed the view^that unconditional surrender was bad tactics vis-a-vis Germany said that itwould be better for the United Nations to work out terms of surrender and let them be made known to the German people.4. We have therefore tried to examine what effect the formula hashitherto exercised on the German armed forces and on German morale generally,and whether any. elaboration of the formula or amplifying pronouncement wouldbe likely to assist military operations this year and hasten&apos; the downfall ofGermany.Effect of Formula on German Morale.5. The formula of unconditional surrender is being used by Nazipropaganda to convince the Germans that the loss of the war would be infinitelyworse than their present sufferings. Germany can expect no mercy; the Germannation will be blotted out;.the German people will be held collectively responsiblewith their leaders for all the crimes and misery of the war. There is ampleevidence that such talk is having its effect, chiefly upon the uninstructed masses* CCS. 426/1, paragraph 2. f Frozen 1038.$ W.P. (44) 33. g Grand 1208.T26871].
but in some degree upon all civilians, who feel that they will be involved withtheir country in complete collapse of the sociaJ and economic structure.It appears, therefore, that though the fear of the Gestapo remains, the chieffactor in inducing the German civilian population to continue the struggle, theuse made by Nazi propaganda of the formula of unconditional surrender is a contributory influence.6. The mainspring of the effort of the German armed forces, especially the professional officer class, continues to be discipline and only defeats in thefield will break this, discipline. Nevertheless, the German soldier, sailor andairman who is personally aware of the atrocities committed by Germans and ofthe ferocious retaliation by the Russians, has better reason still for believing the propaganda which warns him of the retribution and revenge of his enemies.Possible Modification or Amplification of Formula.7. Since it is clear that Nazi propaganda has been successful in convertingthe formula of unconditional surrender into one of the props supporting theGerman will to resist, we have considered if there is anything we can do toremove this prop.8. We are convinced that it would be a cardinal mistake to abandon theformula now. It has stimulated Allied morale and it leaves the Governmentsof the United Nations a free hand to take such action as may be necessary tobring home to the German people that their defeat is complete and has beenacknowledged.9. We believe, however, that without retreating from the policy ofunconditional surrender we might weaken German will to resist and separate the people from their leaders by giving out to the world a pronouncement by thethree Heads of Governments on the kind of future they propose to secure forthe German people. We attach at Annex a brief indication of the lines on whichwe suggest the pronouncement should be drafted.10, Prom the military point of view it were better, if the pronouncementis to be made at all, that it should be made soon, so that any effect would be felt in a drop in the morale of German troops before &quot; Overlord.&quot;Conclusion.11. We conclude that we should stand to gain and have nothing to loseby the early issue of a pronouncement to the world by the three Heads of Govern-ments on the lines suggested at Annex.(Signed) A. F. BROOKE.C. PORTAL.A. B. CUNNINGHAMOffices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,5th February, 1944.ANNEX.Draft Declaration.1. Germany shall be deprived of the fruits of her greed and aggression and held responsible for all the loss and damage caused by the war.2. German war criminals shall be handed over to punishment but there willbe no mass reprisals against the people of Germany.3. Steps will be taken to ensure that German aggression cannot bo renewedand that the Nazi Party system and Prussian domination and militarism areextirpated.4. We shall assist in building up a new, Germany based on the rule of lawand&apos; truth and it will be our desire to maintain the livelihood of the people. we wish them to have a normal chance to develop in peace as useful and respectablemembers of the European family.
