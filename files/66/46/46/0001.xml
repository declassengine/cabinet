A. B.9th February, 1944.India Office Memorandum.1. Serious consideration has for some time been given to the questionwhether India can play its part in the South-East Asia campaign unless thereis some considerable adjustment of the scale and direction of its war effort and substantial relief and assistance are given from outside. The exploitation ofIndia&apos;s resources in man-power and material for direct military purposes hasinvolved a relatively enormous level of expenditure and a great diversion of productive capacity and materials away from civil purposes. In addition, heavyexports of foodstuffs and raw materials have been maintained. Meanwhile,imports particularly of goods for civilian consumption have been drasticallyreduced. It is only recently that it has been possible to introduce a measure ofcompensation in the form of substantial imports of gold. This war effort.hasled not only to a serious deficiency of goods for local consumption, but also to agreat outpouring of currency, as a result of which the position has become lop-sided to a menacing degree. The usual symptoms of a violent inflationarymovement became apparent early in 1943. Since the middle of that year the steps taken by the Government of India in various fields have availed to hold thegeneral level of prices fairly steady, but the balance is still precarious. Moreover,the difficulty of handling the situation has been increased by the extreme pressure upon the transportation system. The further effort involved in the South-east asia campaign may well, therefore, cause apprehension, particularly in view ofthe imperative necessity of maintaining a stable economy in India if its value asan operational base is not to be endangered.2. The Government of India were accordingly led in October last to reportthe following conclusions : (a) They could not risk any further worsening of the position, and therefore asked that increased expenditure should in the future be offset by increased imports of goods and bullion, or reduction of demands forwar production, so as to permit of increased manufacture for the needsof the vast Indian population. As regards production, they did not ask for an over-all decrease in 1944, realising that an adjustment forthat year might be difficult to bring about at so late a stage, but theydid ask that any unavoidable demands beyond the present programme should be offset by corresponding reductions elsewhere in theprogramme, and that no new long-term projects should be undertaken.T26740]
In 1945 assuming that the war in the West will end by the autumn of 1944 they asked for a measure of relief by way of a substantialdecrease in production demands.(b) They required adequate imports of foodstuffs.(c) They emphasised that the efficiency of the internal transportation services(rail, inland water and coastal shipping) must be raised to a leveladequate to meet the military and economic demands which will beplaced upon them.These proposals were reported to the Cabinet Committee on Indian financial questions, which concluded that it was essential to work out their effect in detailbefore any decision could be taken. In order to do this, it proved necessary toelucidate certain aspects of the matter with the Government of India, from whom,detailed information regarding their objectives is now beginning to come in.3. It seemed probable that when these replies from India had been studied by an interdepartmental committee here and the capacity of the United kingdom to help had been ascertained, it would be necessary to make a high levelapproach to the United States Administration in order to secure the balance ofthe assistance required to strengthen the Indian base to meet the anticipateddemands upon it. Meanwhile, however, the United States Chiefs of Staff have themselves raised the question with the United Kingdom Chiefs of Staff in amemorandum prepared for the Cairo Conference but apparently not consideredthere. After briefly alluding to some of the Government of India&apos;s proposals,they say : &quot; It is questionable as to whether or not all of these are required. Thereis no question, however, that plans must be made at the present time for theexpansion of India as a base for further operations to bring about the earliestdefeat of Japan.&quot;   They then propose &quot; that a combined committee be formed in India to meet in New Delhione,month after the completion of the &apos; Sextant &apos; Conference to determine the extent of economic assistance necessary for India to be built up as a proper base, and to submit a report in three months after completion of&apos; Sextant&apos; and in time for study prior to the next Conference.&quot;4. This proposition was communicated to the Government of India, whohave replied welcoming it in principle and accepting the formula in the abovequotation as appropriate terms of reference. They make the following suggestions : (a) That the Committee should consist of a civilian of suitable experience and status, nominated each by the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates, assisted by a military officer nominated by each Chiefs ofStaff. With each side should be associated, if desired, anothermilitary officer selected by either party from officers serving in Indiato give the necessary local background. (They have separatelysuggested that the United Kingdom civilian representative will need to have both financial and supply experience, and in particularexperience in dealing with the Americans, and also that GeneralFlutton, Secretary of the War Resources Committee of the Viceroy&apos;council, would be the best officer to be selected by the United kingdom from officers serving in India to give local background.)(&amp;) That the Committee should assemble at the earliest possible date andthat the report should be presented to the Governments of the United. States, the United Kingdom and India as a matter of very great urgency.(c) That when the Committee&apos;s report comes up for consideration in London,the Government of India should be suitably represented at discussionsupon it.(d) That meanwhile action in connection with any anti-inflationary measures already under discussion should not be held up either in India or inLondon.Copies of the relevant telegrams are appended.5. Since this reference was made to the Government of India to ascertaintheir reactions to the American suggestion, it is learned that the positionindicated in the first paragraph of the Chiefs of Staff telegram (Annexure B) stillobtains, namely, that the operational plans for 1945 and later years, for whichIndia would be the base, are not yet so fully worked out that the consequentialload on India&apos;s resources can be closely estimated and thus the assistance required from outside to enable that load to be carried, be specified.   It would be
premature, therefore, to set up at once a Committee &apos;&apos; to determine the extent ofeconomic assistance necessary for India to be built up as a proper base &apos;&apos; for operations the scale of which is not yet determined.  Nevertheless, the India office is disposed to agree with the Government of India&apos;s main underlying view that,given (i) that India&apos;s economic position is already such that the continuance of eventhe present load threatens an economic collapse; (ii) that assistance from outsidewill in any case be necessary, and (iii) that a proportion of it will be required from the United States, it would be of great value that responsible Americanauthority should be seized, by association in an enquiry on the spot, of the seriousness of the situation so that by their first-hand report they might createin the American Administration an atmosphere favourable to the reception of whatever requests for assistance not confined necessarily to military equipment may have to be made to the United States after the quota which can be providedby the United Kingdom has been determined.   It will be seen that the Govern-ment of India do not propose to hold up the action already in progress to securerelief in various directions; this will command general concurrence, but it seemsto entail the consequence that the proposed Anglo-American Committee shouldtake cognisance of such measures as have thus been put in train in order to avoidduplication of effort between it and the official Committee which already is working on the Government of India&apos;s recommendations.  This consideration leads to the view that the terms of reference to any joint Committee should be more precise than the formula originally suggested by the United States Chiefs of staff and accepted by the Government of India; and in the second recommendationbelow a formula designed to safeguard the position of the Government of india is suggested tentatively.It is recommended accordingly (1) That the United States Chiefs of Staff be informed that their suggestionis accepted in principle and that they will be invited as soon as the strategicalrequirements are defined to arrange for representation on the basis proposed bythe Government of India. (The detailed arrangements for United kingdom representation and any secretarial staff required might be separately discussed between the Ministers directly concerned.)(2) That the terms of reference to the Committee might be on the following-lines :-The Committee will make recommendations as to the extent of economic assistance required so that India may be built up as a proper base for theforthcoming operations in South-East Asia. It will do so after taking accountof the measures that the Government of India consider necessary in the dischargeof their constitutional responsibilities, but it is no part of their terms of referenceto enquire into the general financial and economic policy of the Government ofIndia. In considering the question remitted to it, the Committee will take note of the measures of relief which have either been applied or are in process of application. The Committee will submit its report to the Government of Indiaand simultaneously transmit copies to the British and United States Chiefs ofStaff respectively.(3) That as soon as possible after receipt of the report the Government ofIndia should telegraph their comments and recommendations on it to the Secretaryof State for India so that any further discussion of the subject with Washingtonmay be in accordance with the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(When the report has been approved by the Combined Chiefs of Staff it willbe necessary for the Government of India to place detailed requirements to giveeffect to it on London through the normal channels, so as to permit of the proper^       screening and allocation of priorities by the appropriate authorities.)(4) That inter-departmental discussion of requirements formulated beforethe establishment of the Anglo-American Committee in India should continuemeanwhile in anticipation of the Committee&apos;s report. There may well be manyways in which relief can be afforded forthwith, and in any case study of thesupply problems arising should help to shorten discussion when the report hasbeen received by the combined body proposed to be set up in London. -6.

ANNEXURE A.Telegram from Secretary of State to Governor-General, No-. 29471, dated- 25th December, 1943.Most Secret. I have just received memorandum by United States Chiefs ofStaff which was circulated during Cairo Conference but apparently not consideredthere by Combined Chiefs of Staff. Request has now been received from washington for opinion of our Chiefs of Staff and I have been asked to comment.2. United States memorandum deals with the question of fitting India as abase to support S.E.A.C. operations.   Memorandum opens as follows :-&apos;&apos; The Government of India has indicated that the country haspractically reached the saturation point as to what it can do economically in supporting operations in South-East Asia and in China, and if it is to be expanded as a base for further operations in those theatres, certain steps mustbetaken.  They list as essential for expansion.&quot;Then follows Jist of five measures in first part of paragraph 2 of War Depart-ment telegram of the 21st October, No. 5965 plus Item 16 (Transportation) insecond part of same paragraph. (No mention is made of items 1-5 of second part,viz., those relative to new projects and production programmes.) Memorandumobserves &apos;&apos; It is questionable as to whether or not all of these are required. Thereis no question, however, that plans must be made at the present time for theexpansion of India as a base for further operations to bring about the earliestdefeat of Japan.&quot; After indicating summarily nature of such operations andremarking that &quot; extent to which it is desired to develop India as a base shouldbe determined at an early date &quot; and necessary economic steps taken, memorandumconcludes with the following recommendation : .&apos;&quot; The United States Chiefs of Staff propose that a combined committeebe formed in India to meet in New Delhi one month after the completion ofthe &apos; Sextant &apos; Conference to determine the extent of economic assistancenecessary for India to be built up as a proper base, and to submit a report in three months after completion of &apos; Sextant &apos; and in time for study prior tothe next Conference.&quot;3. There is nothing to show that authors of memorandum knew of discus-sions now in progress in India for the purpose of presenting the breakdown whichI asked for in reply to your&apos;telegram of the 21st October. We for our part do not know whether United States representatives have been associated with discussionsnow proceeding in India. If not and if the deliberations have not progressed too far it might perhaps be considered whether advantage can be served by nowrassociating United States representative with them if any one of suitable calibreis available whose views are likely to be sympathetic to our case and to carryweight in Washington, iissuming circumstances allow this might possibly be away of meeting the substance of the American request without involving them inany inquisition into circumstances and adequacy of economic action taken by government of India.4. You will no doubt agree in any case that the time-table suggested inabove-quoted recommendation is not consistent with the urgent needs of thesituation. I am. therefore disposed to consider whether, either in lieu of or inaddition to the association of Americans with discussions in India, it might notbe advantageous (on the assumption, which please confirm, that you will place mein possession of results of discussions in India at a very early date) to associateUnited States representatives with discussions whether interdepartmental or on ministerial level, or both, which will then be necessary in London anyhow.;5. Please let me have your considered views on above questions as soon aspossible.His Excellency the Viceroy should see.
ANNEXURE B.Telegram from C.O.S. to J.S.M., Washington, C.O.S. (W) 1050, dated6th January, 1944.Reference CCS 421 of the 4th December.1. The first essential will be agreed, phased target for landward, overseas,and air operations to be based on India. We are preparing an estimate basedon &quot; Sextant&quot; and post-&quot; Sextant&quot; decisions. Efficient and economicalprovisions of base facilities and estimate of India&apos;s capacity to meet them depends on this target.2. Questions of the extent to which India&apos;s economic difficulties may restrictpreparations and of means to remedy them are already being considered, bycommittees of Indian authorities concerned in Delhi in association with an officialsub-committee of a War Cabinet Committee in London, by which their conclusionswill be considered and recommendations adjusted.3. We feel, therefore, that on the one hand to set up a combined committeein Delhi now might involve doing again what committees there have alreadynearly completed and on the other that it would be premature to agree to theproposed combined committee until we know the nature of the recommendations tobe made by the Delhi committees. These may well prove to be suitable subjectsfor discussion by a combined committee in either London or Delhi when we havebeen able to focus the problem.ANNEXURE C.Telegram from Government of India, War Department, to Secretary of Statefor India, No. 228, dated 10th January, 1944.Most Secret. Your 29471 of the 25th December. Americans have not been formally associated with discussions now going on concerning your 25880 of the11th November, and connected correspondence, although Wheeler is awaregenerally of our views concerning economic conditions of India.2. We would welcome proposed combined committees, but do not think thatthere is any United States representative in India other than Wheeler himself(who is too preoccupied) of suitable calibre available to associate with our discussions. We recommend that combined committees should consist of a civilian of suitable experience and status nominated each by United Kingdom and united States assisted by a military officer nominated by each CCS. With each side could be associated if desired another military officer selected by either partyfrom officers serving in India to give the necessary local background.3. Terms of reference proposed in your paragraph 2 (? do) not contemplateinquisition into adequacy of economic action taken by Government of India, andif adhered to would be suitable, and we trust that committee wall endeavour to be wholly constructive.4. Matter is urgent and we recommend assembling of committee at earliestpossible date. Report should be presented to Washington, London and to us as amatter of very great urgency. We do not propose to hold up action to progress anyof the anti-inflationary measures now under discussion between us, and trust thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government will progress them actively pending this committee&apos;sreport.5. When committee&apos;s report will come up for consideration in Londondesirable that India should be suitably represented at discussions on it.6.   His Excellency the Viceroy has seen.
