(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRIT^TNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GCVT2L1NMENT&quot;)SECRET WAR    OABINBT1 r: copy No y*8W.P. (44) 77      .        . &quot;INDIA4th February,.1944* . \Shipments of Food Grains to india memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Food..1, I wish to bring befdre my colleagues certain aspects of theproblem.raised by the Secretary of State for India in his paper(W.P.(44)63)  so that the issue may be considered as a whole.2. Ceylon..   Ceylon needs a minimum of   10*000 tons of rice amonth if she is to maintain the production of rubber, tea and other essential commodities and provide labour for military purposes.    Thegeneral ration has been reduced to 4 lbs.  of cereals per person perweek of which only 1 lb.  can be taken :&apos;in rice, compared with thepresent ration of 8 lbs.  of cereals in Calcutta and 7 lbs.  in Bombay.It is generally agreed to be impossible to reduce the:rice rationfurther.3. Owing to the small crop in Egypt, it is highly improbable that enough rice will be obtained from that source to supply Ceylonafter March 1944-.     Shipping difficulties preclude regular shipments &apos;from Brazil and no alternative source of supply is available unlessIndia will agree to resume shipments.a. The export from India to Ceylon of 10,000 tons of ricemonthly from her crop can make no appreciable difference to India,but is of critical importance.in- an area of high and growing strategic importance, both to the Empire as a whole and to India in particular.5* Groundnuts.      The prospect of a serious shortage of oils ..and.fats in the world is now generally appreciated.      India hasalways&apos;been an important exporter of groundnuts, but is now refusing to allow more than 200,000 tons to be exported in the year ending31st October, 1944? unless, an assurance of imports of cereals canbe given.      If it is agreed that India should import wheat, I suggestthat she should be asked to release in the year ending 31st Octobernext, 475*000 tons of groundnuts over 400,000 tons of which has duly,been purchased by the Ministry of Food.      The groundnuts are requirednot only for the United Kingdom but for the dominions and colonies and for urgent War Office needs in the Middle East,6. World Wheat Position.    Although on supply grounds there isnot sufficient reason at this moment to raise serious objection to theIndian request for this large quantity of wheat, I think that theWar Cabinet should be aware that there is a prospective worldshortage of cereals.1* Although stocks of wheat have been increasing substantially in North-America, Austrr. lia and the Argentine over the past fewyears and reached a record high level in July 1943? these reserves are likely to decline by 17 million tons before July 1944 and in thefollowing year may be depleted still further to a dangerously low level.      in North America there is now insufficient wheat availablec-* .&quot;the ports to meet the needs of Italy and Portugal after satisfyingother immediate needs (e.g.  of the United Kingdom).-     During the pastlew days,, the United States food authorities have made the followingannouncements:-1. /(a)
(r)    The United States cannot meet the requirements of Italy.(b) They must be regarded in future as a wheat importing country.175,000,000 bushels (say, k,500,000 t ns)  of wheat need to be.imported into the United States from Canada this year.(c) They cannot honour their obligation to supply free v/heat for relief under the International Wheat Agreement.........8. There are also acute internal transportation -clifficultieNorth America..: Even in May when the Great Lakes thaw,  it is doubt [Whether it will be possible to move to the seaboard all the wheat-which will be required.      Accordingly, Australia and the Argentinemay well have to continue to bear the full weight of the burdenthrown on them by these developments in North America.9- Australia is already exporting wheat and flour at therate of about 150,000 tons a month and this figure will be increasedappreciably by Italy&apos;.s needs ?/hich cannot be met from&apos; North America,When the Balkans fall into our hands,  there will be fresh and heavy demands.      If India&apos;s request were met in full from Australia, wewould have to supply the Mediterranean theatre increasingly from the-Argentine rather than Australia, with a resulting increase in the:   &apos;strain on shipping and foreign exchange.      Alternatively India&apos;request would have to be met partly from the Argentine.&apos;10.    I am awaiting a.full review of the future, position of wheat from .the Combined Pood board    ^feeoa-Hrrrc^\^^^r-^rfT^rirr^ehou 1 d-^mro4aj-&amp;y. and when the Cabinet has decided&apos; how muchwheat India should receive, I would wish to refer the problem of meeting this requirement to that,,Board immediately.ift.; The Secretary of State for Colonies and Ministry of War Transpoconcur in the general terms of this paper.Ministry of F0od, J.J.L1.W. 1&apos;.Uth February, 19AA.I
