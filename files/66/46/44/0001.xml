(44) 94.%th February, 1944.WAR CABINET.RE-ALLOCATION OF MAN-POWER DURING THE transition period BETWEEN THE END OF THE WAR IN europe and THE END OF THE WAR IN JAPAN.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.1. In his Memorandum of the 2nd February (W.P. (44) 71) the Minister ofLabour and National Service states that the existing powers of control overindustry and labour and the compulsory recruitment of men for the armed forces will have to be continued until the end of the war with Japan; and pro-poses that members of the Armed Forces should receive certain financial and other -benefits on release from the Forces. I have considered the application of theseproposals to the Civil Defence Services and have reached the following conclusions :  &apos;Continuance of existing powers of Control.2. The Civil Defence Services are not mentioned in the Memorandum butit is likely that Defence Regulation 29b and the Defence (National Fire Service)Regulations, 1941, under which the &quot; freezing &quot; Orders are made, will becontinued for some time after the end of the war in Europe. The extent to whichit will be desirable to retain persons in these Services will vary, being; greater inthe case of the Police War Reserve and National Fire Service than in the civil defence General Services, where few, if any, will be needed. In any case,however, it is doubtful how far it would be practicable to use emergency powersto retain persons compulsorily employed by Local Authorities on non-operationalduties but remunerated under civil defence conditions and on civil defence rates which approximate as closely as possible to those obtaining in the Armed Forces,especially where, as in the case of the volunteers, they will have no reinstatementrights in civil employment. In any case, some modification of their terms oservice will have to be considered.Where a person has been released from the Civil Defence Services, should he be liable to be called up for service in the Armed Forces?3. The compulsory recruitment of men for the Forces after the end of thewar in Europe will apply to those reaching the age of 18 and to young men,mainly in the munitions industries, whose call-up has hitherto been deferred. Itis understood that it is unlikely that men over 30 will be called up during thisperiod. Most men under 30 in the Civil Defence Services have already been released to the Armed Forces, and I see no strong reason why the remaining small number, mainly key-men, should not be conscribed into the Armed Forces, if theinterests of the country require it, in the same way as young men who have been reserved in industry.; 26897]
Grant of financial and other benefits on or after release.4. Proposals are made by the Minister of Labour for the grant of paidfurlough, war gratuities and post-war credits, and for the issue of civilian clothesand service clothes to members of the Armed Porces on release from the Forces.The proposed benefits vary for different classes according to&quot; the circumstancesof release.5. I consider that the principle of paid furlough and gratuity should be conceded to the Civil Defence Services, but how it should be applied is not easy to determine. They do not fit naturally into any of the classes proposed for the armed forces. It is arguable that they approximate most closely to Class A,since, unlike Class B, they are not going direct into employment in industry andthere is, moreover, no certainty that many will find, immediate employment. this applies particularly to the higher age groups, which preponderate : in the WardenService, for instance, 45 per cent, are 60 or over. Again, the great majorityare volunteers and therefore without any right, under the new Bill, of reinstate-men! in their previous employment. The counter arguments are that return to ordinary civilian life will involve a less complete change for members of theCivil Defence Services than for members of the Armed Forces; that on the wholethey will be released more quickly; and that, since their service in Civil defence will have been for the most part near their homes, they should be in a better position to secure local employment.6. On balance, I think that there is a case for treating them like Class A,but if in the light of the counter arguments, my colleagues should think that a shorter period of paid furlough would be equitable, I would not press for morethan the four weeks proposed for Class B. It would, however, be necessary to treat them like Class A to the extent of giving them their gratuity and post-war.credits at the end of the period of paid furlough, instead of keeping them waiting until the end of the war.7. The same considerations will apply generally to the other Civil defence services (i.e., the Police War Reserve and other auxiliary services, National fire service and the Civil Defence Reserve), except that in the National Fire service at least 10,000 war-time members will need to be retained until the permanentpeace-time establishment can be made up. A number of police auxiliaries willsimilarly have to be retained for a period: Steps will have to be taken to ensurethat the rights to financial and other benefits of any members retained in this way-are preserved..8. The Reconstruction Committee (R (43) 1st Meeting, 20th December1943) invited the Minister of Eeconstruction to arrange for further inter-departmental examination of the application to Civil Defence of thearrangements for the provision of civilian clothing and retention of uniform.This matter is still under consideration.9. In accordance with the proposed treatment to be accorded to mendischarged from the Armed Forces before the end of the European war(paragraph 14 (ii) of the Minister of Labour&apos;s Memorandum), men alreadydischarged by that date from Civil Defence (for reasons other than misconduct)should receive as soon as possible the post-war credit to which they are entitledand a war gratuity, but not paid furlough or civilian clothing. This would also apply to members on long-term release from Civil Defence to industry.10. It may also be necessary to consider the position of regular members ofthe Police and Fire Services in regard to these proposals in the light of such provision as may be proposed for regular members of the Armed Forces.11. The Secretary of State for Scotland is in agreement with my proposals,and the Minister of Health concurs in so far as they affect the Civil DefenceCasualty Services.H.
