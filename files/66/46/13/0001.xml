THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT    jPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1.944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 63.28 th January, 1944Copy No.  war CABINET.INDIA.SHIPMENT OF FOOD GRAINS TO INDIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.WHEN the question of importing food grains into India was discussed inthe autumn it was decided that the question should be reviewed again in thelight of the Indian harvests. In November- the Cabinet agreed to continueshipping supplies for the first two months of 1944 to give the necessary time tomake available the facts for this review. Since mid-October 130,000 tons of barley have been shipped from Iraq and 80,000 tons of wheat from Australia.10,000 tons of wheat are being shipped from Canada and another 100.000 from australia in January and February.Estimates of the 1943-44 crops are set out in Appendix I. They indicate a promise of improvement over last year in the rice crop of 3-3v, million acres and an improvement of round about 2 million tons in yield. In Bengal alone theimprovement may be even higher in proportion. As against this, lack of rain inthe Punjab is threatening a partial failure of the wheat crop in the spring withunfortunate reactions on defence supplies, on urban rationing, especially in Calcutta, and worst of all on the co-operation of the Punjab Government and.people in the Centre&apos;s efforts to secure an all-India food policy both in relationto supplies and prices.The present position, in relation to which these crop prospects have to beconsidered, may be summarised thus : Bengal.In Bengal the harvesting of the new crop marks, for the time being at anyrate, the end of actual shortage there. But famine is being followed by epidemicdisease in the form of cholera and malaria, and the process of rehabilitation is obviously going to prove troublesome. Administrative and political weaknesses,brought to light by the famine and partly masked for the moment by military aid, have led&apos;the Viceroy to propose very drastic remedies which the War cabinet have not been able to accept and the result over all is that the confidence of thepeople is badly shaken, the Viceroy has grave doubts of the possibility of copingwith the administrative problems arising through the normal constitutional machinery, and the new Governor enters on a field where the recurrence oftroubles comparable with those of last autumn forms a continuous threat. Inthe effort to secure the necessary restoration of confidence the Viceroy has accepted responsibility for 1944 for feeding Calcutta from sources outsideBengal. This involves a new charge of some 650,000 tons, half wheat and halfrice, on the rest of India.The Rest of India.Meanwhile the rest of India has succeeded, notwithstanding the drain of relief supplies for Bengal, in holding its own against the threats of short-agewhich overhung Madras, Bombay and the Malabar States a year ago. Adminis-trative machinery, including a growing measure of urban rationing, is workingsuccessfully in all three though Travancore and Cochin are causing some anxietystill. Price control and rationing in the surplus provinces, especially the Punjab,[26783] b
have only been achieved with much difficulty and their maintenance in adverseconditions is precarious. It is, in my view, a great achievement on Lord WaveH&apos;part to have secured the Punjab&apos;s acquiescence in an all-India food policy. Hehas also had to take strenuous measures with the Sind Ministry.Defence.There is no need to elaborate the essential need, for defence and operational reasons, of an orderly and sufficiently fed population in India, more especially inthe Eastern provinces including Bengal. Co-operation 6n friendly terms withthe Moslem Governments of the North-West is equally essential, but apart fromthese political aspects of food, defence needs are raising a supply problem of serious dimensions. Defence requirements for 1943 were put at about 650,000tons of grain, largely wheat. In 1944 military needs have risen to round about one million tons, of which little more than half can be regarded as transfers from civil to military. On the basis, incontestable from the economic standpoint, that india should be relieved of new defence demands, about 480 thousand tons offoodgrains for defence have to be included in India&apos;s import demand.Economic stability and operational needs.India is seeking to close an inflationary gap of Rs. 250 crores a year, and among the many measures taken or proposed to this end, the import of consumer goods, with food as the most obvious consumption need of an undeveloped people,remains the quickest acting of all remedies. The importance of India&apos;s economic stability to her use as a base of operations and of supply has been sufficientlyelaborated elsewhere. The Viceroy has not ceased to stress the importance of thefood problem to maintaining that stability.A mounts fisked for.With this situation in view the Viceroy has pressed upon me the view that,notwithstanding the good rice crop now harvested, the demand of the Gregoryfood grains committee for imports and the importance persistently attached tosuch an import programme, both by himself and his predecessor, must be main-tained. That demand is made up of 1,000,000 tons per annum for current consumption and an additional 500,000 tons this year for the formation of areserve in the hands of the Centre.Current consumption requirements.As regards the necessity for maintaining imports for current consumption itis pointed out, both by the Gregory Committee and by the Viceroy and hisGovernment, that prior to the loss of Burma, India imported food grains (ricemainly) to an average net amount of over 1,000,000 tons per year. India&apos;sconsumption is not calculable with any degree of accuracy but. subject to a carryover of unknown dimensions varying with the crop, the consumption of the people and more especially of the rural producing element was adjusted to the crop; sothat for the non-producing element of the population the amount available variedlittle, consisting of a more or less constant marketed portion of the crop, plusimports and an unknown element of carry over. The experience of the past year has convinced the authorities in India that the loss of imports since 1942 hasmeant the consumption of the carry over and now, reserves having been consumed,is a major cause of shortage and that, though the exhaustion of a concealedreserve has not been evident till now, its results will persist, and may at any moment create a critical situation, so long as imports are not replaced. The effectof such a deficiency on confidence and so on prices is far in excess of its apparentmagnitude, and it has also to be coupled with the new calls for Calcutta and for defence to which reference has been made above. Nor pan this deficiency bereplaced by increased internal production, for Lord Wavell points out that fullya third of the population is underfed and will absorb such crop increases even before they reach the market. The great mass of the Indian population has atthe best lived on a scale which makes our ideas of &quot; austerity &quot; look luxurious,and there is no scope for belt-tightening. A11 this is quite apart from the yearlyincrease of 5 million in the population^ which has note gone on long enough toensure that vast numbers of additional adult mouths are coming into, fullconsumption every year. Since the war began the increase in the Indianpopulation is eqicivalent to about half the total population of these islands.* 5 million adults consume nearly a million tons of grain a year.
Reserve.In addition to 1 million tons for current consumption the Viceroy asks forhalf-a-million tons of wheat this year for reserve. The need for this is largely amatter of price control. The Central Government needs to be able to hold offthe market if it is to keep down the price of grain from the surplus provinces and for this purpose it must be able to supply deficiencies elsewhere when theyoccur. Requirements for this purpose can only be a matter of estimate and theGovernment of India do not feel that this part of their task can be achieved with less than the half million tons asked for.Relations between price control and, grain imports.It is worth noting that the Government of India have, within the last fewdays, held a conference with Provincial representatives on control of winter grainprices, as a result of which it has been agreed to impose immediately an all-Indiamaximum price for millets, an all-India price for rice being postponed pendingthe success of efforts now being made to bring down prices in the provinces wherethey are excessive. This is a long step forward on the hard road to an all-Indiafood policy, on which the Government of India are to be congratulated, but theintimation of it is accompanied and conditioned by a unanimous emphasis, on thepart of the Viceroy and his Council, on the pressing need of a wheat reserveonly obtainable through imports, without which a poor wheat harvest win\raisethe price of wheat and so put upward pressure on the price of other grainsbeyond the capacity of the provinces to withstand.A definite undertaking.In peace time the effective check on the effort to raise prices was the limitlessreserve of rice in Burma. India, having lost this, needs to be able to point the would-be profiteer to a firm promise of regular imports which can be used tokeep prices in check. For this reason the Viceroy attaches almost as much importance to regularity and certainty of supply as to amount; indeed, some hopeis suggested that given a firm promise publicly announced and for a time publiclyfulfilled, it might prove unnecessary to take up the full amount.The request.I am well aware of the difficulties involved. But in spite of them, and onthe basis indicated above, I must press to the fullest extent the request thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government will authorise shipping for the quantities of wheatstated a million tons this year for use and, half a million for reserve, and for,these quantities to be regularly supplied in accordance with a publicly announcedundertaking. Lord Wavell has seen as much of the present, food position as any man and has done as much to meet it and I quote his own words in support ofthis demand, telegraphed to me in the last few days : -&quot; Throughout 1944 I shall have a hard struggle to hold prices and tostave off shortages and actual famine. I may not be able to prove this to the satisfaction of the War Cabinet, but the facts are quite evident here. Pleasetell your colleagues that they have been warned.&quot;L. S. A..India Office, 28th January, 1944.[26783]
Estimated Supplies and Requirements of the Principal Cereals in india during 1944.Supplies.The Second Forecast of the Indian rice crop issued in December lastestimated the area under rice at that date at 76,075,000 acres, compared with71,519,000 acres in the previous December and an average of 69,661,000 acres forthe corresponding forecasts of the three preceding years. The final forecast for1942-43 was 74,919,000 acres with a yield of 24,533,000 tons. The average finalforecast of the three preceding years was 73,313,000 acres with a yield of24,412,000 tons. Despite the considerable increase in acreage which has takenplace this season and the fact that the rice crop has escaped any of the naturaldisasters (cyclones, floods and pests) which so adversely affected the outturn lastyear, the Government of India are not prepared to put the yield of the currentcrop at more than 26,000,000 tons.No forecast of the current season&apos;s wheat crop is yet available, but, owing to lack of rain in the Punjab, the yield is expected to be as much as 1 million tonsbelow that of last year (10,971,000 tons). Forecasts of the other cereal crops arenot issued.&quot;The best estimates which the Government of India oan make at present ofthe yields of the main cereal crops this season are as follows : Tons 000.Rice    .................. 26,000Millets and Maize............ 12,200Wheat          ............... 10,000Gram.................. 3,500Barley          ............       ... 2,100Total, 1943-44.........      53,800Compared with (a) 1942-43.................      53,928(&amp;) Average of five preceding years       ...      51,792Requirements.The cereal requirements of India during 1944 are estimated by the Govern-ment of India on the basis of (a) the average production of the three years ending 1938-39 (53,495,000 tons) plus (b) the average annual imports of thethree years ending 1939-40 (1,298,000 tons), making together 54,793,000 tons,plus Defence Services requirements. The all-over figure for the latter is put at million tons, but 515,520 tons of this represents the normal consumptionrequirements of the Indian Army, so that the extra-normal Defence requirementsoccasioned by the increase in the Indian Army and the presence in India ofnon-Indian services personnel, and of labour employed on Defence works, amountsto 484,480 tons.* Thus, the net consumption requirements for all purposes canbe stated as follows : *Tons 000.Normal requirements        ...      ...      ...      ...      54,793Extra requirements for Defence.......      ... 484-5Total requirements ...      ...      ...      55,277-5Against estimates crops of ...      ...      ...      53,800Leaving a net deficit of     ...      ...      ...      ...        1,477-5* This figure is made up as follows:  Tons.(1) For non-Indian troops, including Unites States, Chinese, west and East African and British troops additional to pre-war strength       ........................ 181,480(2) Excess of military scale of rations  over normal civil consump-tion of additional Indian Army personnel        ...       ...       ... 180,000(3) Similar excess for labour on Defence works ...       ...       ...        50,000(4) Shortage of wheat products in Defence Services reserves, 1943,which has to be made good in 1944     ...      ...       ...      ...        73,000
Extract from Conclusions of Gregory Fooclgrains Policy Committee, 1943.(Chapter 4, S.19.)19.   Our conclusions are :  (i) India must cease, for the duration of the war, to be a net exporter offood : no exports should be permitted unless such exports are fully compensatedby imports in addition to the imports mentioned in the succeeding paragraph.( No exports of rice should be permitted at all. The Food Department must be completely satisfied that such compensatory arrangements are entirely adequate.In no other way will it be possible to stop the crop of rumours which haveexercised a dangerous effect on the country.(ii) As regards imports, the Government of India should (a) press for imports to create a Central Food Grains Reserve, which should not be less than500,000 tons. Such a quantity is absolutely necessary to prevent a break-down of the machinery of the procurement, rationing and price policies outlined in subsequent chapters. It is not a substitute for but a complement to more vigorous administrative action in other fields, (b) press the United Nations toarrange for imports for current consumption until further notice, equal in amount per annum to the average annual net imports of the last five years or about one million tons.   This request is strongly urged on two grounds : (i) The fact that the area most likely to be involved in military operationsis also the area most hard-pressecl as regards food supplies, and(ii) that owing to the low per capita standards of consumption generallyprevailing in India as a whole, the degree to which subsistence levelscan be cut is considerably less than in more fortunately situatedcountries.(c) investigate the impact on the food situation in India of the strategicalplans now being elaborated, in so far as they concern the presence of largeOverseas Forces in India.(iii) Whatever arrangements or agreements are entered into should be mostscrupulously observed, in order to minimise the dangers of misinterpretationand rumour-mongering.
