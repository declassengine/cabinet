THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTCORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER and marshal TITO.I.The Prime Minister to Marshal Tito, dated 8th January, 1944.Sir,I thank you very much for your kind message about my health from&apos; yourselfand the heroic Patriot and Partisan army of Yugoslavia. From Major Deakin,who is a friend of mine, I learnt all about your valiant efforts. It is my mostearnest desire to give you all aid in human power by sea supplies, by Air support and by Commandos helping you in the island fighting. Brigadier Maclean isalso a friend of mine and a colleague in the House of Commons. With him atyour Headquarters will soon be serving my son, Major Randolph Churchill, whois also a Member of Parliament.2. One supreme object stands before us; namely, to cleanse the soil ofEurope from the filthy Nazi-Fascist taint. You may be sure that we British haveno desire to dictate the future Government of Yugoslavia. At the same time,we hope that all will pull together as much as possible for the defeat of thecommon foe, and afterwards settle the form of Government in accordance withthe will of the people.3. I am resolved that the British Government will give no further military support to Mihailovic and will only give help to you, and we should be glad ifthe Royal Yugoslavian Government would dismiss him from their councils.King Peter the Second, however, escaped as a boy from the treacherous clutchesof the Regent. Prince Paul, and came to us as the representative of yugoslavia and as a young Prince in distress. It would not be chivalrous or honourable forGreat Britain to cast him aside. Nor can we ask him to cut all his existingcontacts Avith his country. I hope, therefore, that you.will understand we shallin any case remain in official relations with him while at the same time giving&apos; you all possible military support. I hope also that there may be an end topolemics on either side, for these only help the Germans.4. You may be sure I shall work in the closest contact with my friendsMarshal Stalin and President Roosevelt; and I earnestly hope that the military mission which the Soviet Government are sending to your Headquarters willwork in similar harmony with the Anglo-American Mission under BrigadierMaclean. Please correspond with me through Brigadier Maclean and let meknow anything you think I can do to help, for I will certainly try my best.5. Looking forward to the end of your sufferings and to the liberation ofall Europe from tryanny.Believe me,Yours faithfully,WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.II.Marshal Tito to the Prime Minister, received 3rd February, 1944.(Telegraphic text.)Your Excellency.Your message brought by Brigadier Maclean is valuable proof that our people have in their superhuman struggle for freedom and independence a truefriend and ally at their side who deeply comprehends our needs and ouraspirations.    For me personally your message is an honour for it expresses,your high acknowledgment of our struggle and efforts, of our National liberation-tion Army.   I thank you heartily for your photographs from Tehran Conference.with your dedictation.   Your Excellency may be sure that we will endeavour tokeep your friendship Avon in most difficult hour of our peoples history and whichis. extremely dear to us;    The devastation of the country and the people,exhausted with suffering, need, and will need in future, help of our great Alliesnot only during the war but also in peace to enable us to heal the terrible woundsinflicted on us by the ignoble Fascist invader.   It is our wish to fulfil to the.utmost our duty as an Ally in the common military effort against.our coimnonenemy.   Aid tendered to us by our Allies very much contributes to ease our[26906]
situation on the battlefield. We also hope with your help to obtain heavyarmament (tanks and aircraft) which in present phase-of the war and owing topresent strength of our National Liberation Army is indispensable to us.2. I quite understand your engagements towards King Peter II and hisGovernment and I will contrive as far as the interests of our peoples permit to avoid unnecessary politics and not cause inconvenience to our Allies in thismatter. I assure you, however, your Excellency, that internal political situation created in this arduous struggle for liberation is not only machine for strivingsof individuals or some political group but it is the irresistible desire of allpatriots, of all those who are fighting and long connected with this struggle,and these are enormous majority of the peoples of Yugoslavia. Therefore thepeople have set difficult tasks and we are bound to accomplish them.3. At present moment all our efforts turn to one direction, and thatis, (1) assemble all patriotic -and honourable elements so as to render our struggle against invader as efficient as possible; (2) to create union and brotherhood ofYugoslav nations which did not exist before this war and the absence of which caused the catastrophe in our country; (3) to create conditions for establishmentof a State in which all nations of Yugoslavia would feel happy, and that is atruly democratic Yugoslavia, a federative Yugoslavia. I am convinced that youunderstand us and that we will have your valuable support in these strivingsof our people.Yours very sincerely,TITO,Marshal of Yugoslavia.III.The Prime Minister to Marshal Tito, dated 5th February, 1944.Personal and Most Secret.(Telegraphic text.)I am very glad my letter has reached you safely and I have received yourmessage with pleasure. I can understand the position of reserve which you adopt towards King Peter. I have for.several months past been in favour of advisinghim to dismiss Mihailovitch and to face the consequent resignation of all his present advisers. I have been deterred from doing this by the argument that Ishould thus be advising him to cast away his only adherents. You will understandI feel a personal responsibility towards him. I should be obliged if you would let me know whether his dismissal of Mihailovitch would pave the way for friendly relations with you and your Movement and, later on, for his joining you in thefield, it being understood that the future question of the Monarchy is reserved until Yugoslavia has been entirely liberated. There is no doubt that a workingarrangement between you and the King would consolidate many forces, especiallySerbian elements, now estranged and that it would invest your Government and movement with added authority and provide them with numerous resources.Yugoslavia would then be able to speak with a united voice in the councils of theAllies during this formative period when so much is in flux. I much hope thatyou will feel able to give me the answer you can see I want.2. Your third paragraph expresses exactly what His Britannic Majesty&apos;s &apos;Government desire, namely to assemble all patriotic and honourable elements so asto render your-struggle against the invader as efficient as possible; secondly, tocreate union and brotherhood of the Yugoslav nations; and thirdly, to createconditions for a truly democratic and federative Yugoslavia. You will certainly have the support of His Majesty&apos;s Government in all this.3. I have asked the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean toform immediately an amphibious force of Commandos supported by Air andflotillas to attack with your aid the garrisons which the Germans have left in the islands they have taken along the Dalmatian coast. There is no reason why thesegarrisons should not be exterminated with forces which will shortly be available., .Secondly, we must try to get a through line of communication with you from thesea, even, if we have to move it from time to time. This alone will enable tanks and anti-tank guns and other heavy munitions together with other necessary supplies to be brought in in the quantities which your Armies require. You should talk all this over with Brigadier Maclean who has my entire confidence and immediateaccess to me as well as to the Supreme Commander.W. S. C.
