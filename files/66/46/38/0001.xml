The territories included in the Middle East area will be shown inAppendix I to this Memorandum. The functions of the Minister Resident in theMiddle East in respect of these territories are set out below in paragraphs 3, 4,5 and 6.

I. Middle East Area.3. The Minister Resident in the Middle East will represent the War Cabinetin respect of the functions now assigned to him and will act in its name. his general task will be to supervise, and give guidance to the Commanders-in-Chief,*on matters arising in the territories specified in Appendix I that have hitherto been dealt with by Mr. Casey.4.   In particular, the Minister Resident in the Middle East(i) will   be  responsible  for  co-ordinating  issues  of  general  political importance which affect more than one territory in ins area;(ii) will give guidance to Commanders-in-Chief regarding the administra-tion of occupied enemy territory in Eritrea, Cyrenaica.

(vii) it will be his duty also to keep the War Cabinet and Ministersgenerally informed of what is happening in his sphere.II Territories (other than Turkey) transferred from Middle East toMediterranean Command (vide Appendix II).5. Under the arrangements that have recently been made, responsibilityfor giving political guidance in respect of these territories to the AlliedComrnander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Command, will rest with the minister resident at Allied Headquarters in North-West Africa. It is clearlyimpracticable to uproot from Cairo either the Greek or Yugoslav governments or His Majesty&apos;s Embassies attached thereto, or the organisations now established in the Middle East for dealing with administrative and economic questions arising in the territories transferred from the Middle East to theMediterranean Command. Existing arrangements will,. therefore, continue onmuch the same lines as at present, subject to such alterations as may be necessary,to ensure .;   (a) reference to General Wilson on issues which cannot be decided locally;.   (b) that Mr. Macmillan is placed in a position to make sure that the, , .      -     activities of the organisations remaining in the Middle East underthe control of the Minister Resident but dealing with territorieswithin the Allied Commander-in-Chief&apos;s sphere, are conducted in. i accordance with the political and economic polity of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.* The phrase Commanders-in-Chief in this directive is denned as the Commander-in-Chief,Levant, the Comtnander-in-Chief, Middle East and the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Middle East.
The day-to-day conduct of these organisations will be the responsibility ofthe Minister Resident, Middle East, to whom Mr. Macmillan will communicateany decisions taken by the Allied Ccmmander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, orinstructions he has received on major questions of policy from higher authority.The greatest possible latitude will be given the Minister Resident, Middle East,&apos;to carry out these duties. On subjects dealt with locally in the Middle East, His.Majesty&apos;s Government will communicate direct with the Minister Resident inthe Middle East or His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors to Greece and Yugoslavia as1the case may be, repeating such communications where necessary toMr. Macmillan.G. The more important of the activities referred to in the preceding paragraph are: (i) The M.E,R.R.A. organisation, which deals with refugees from the balkans;(ii) The functions in connection with Balkan relief, now discharged by theM.E.S.C. on behalf of the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East.(iii) The work of the A.T. (B) Committee and the British Military mission to Greece, both of which are responsible to the Commander-in-Chief,Middle East, in so far as they are concerned with procurement and.transport of relief supplies for Balkan Relief in the initial phase.(iv) The functions at present carried out by the Middle East DefenceCommittee and by the Special Operations Committee in respect of the balkan territories in Appendix II.(v) The wrork of certain executive bodies co-ordinating propaganda andsubversive warfare aimed at those territories.Middle East War Council.7. The Middle East War Council will cease to exist and the work that hashitherto been performed by it will in future be performed by the Middle East;Defence Committee.A dministration of Occupied Territory.8. As regards the administration of occupied territory, the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, has delegated his powers to trie Chief Civil Affairs Officer &apos;at Cairo. The latter, and G.O.C.-in-C., East Africa, will keep the minister resident in the Middle East generally informed. G.O.C.-in-C, East Africa, andC.C.A.O., Middle East, with the concurrence of Commander-in-Chief, middle east, have discretion to refer matters to him and take his instructions whenreference to London is unnecessary or would entail unacceptable delay. TheMinister Resident for his part will be entitled to give directions to G.O.C.-in-C,East Africa, and C.C.A.O., Middle East, with the agreement of Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, on matters which seem to him to require such direction.
III. Turkey.9. Although part of the Mediterranean Command, Turkey falls outside the sphere of both the Minister Resident in the Middle East and the minister resident, Allied Force Headquarters. The political information and guidancenecessary for the conduct of Turkish military affairs will, however, be given theCommander-in-Chief, Middle East, as heretofore and to the Commander-in-Chief,Mediterranean, in future by the Foreign Office or His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atAngora, as the case may be, through the medium of the Minister Resident in theMiddle East.Relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government.
