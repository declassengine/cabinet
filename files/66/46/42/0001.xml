THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1944.The circulation of this papigr has been strictly limited. It is issued for the personal use of most SECRET Copy No.W.P. (44) 92.8th February, 1944.WAR CABINET.POLITICAL WARFARE TRAINING SCHOOL.Memorandum by Minister of Information.1. In June 1943 the Political Warfare Executive were authorised to selecta residential training school, housing two hundred students, to train personnel forfront-line and occupational propaganda in connection with operations in western europe. Premises were found in Brondesbury Park. They have now beensuitably equipped and a staff of instructors has been appointed.2. In September 1943 the Political Warfare Executive applied for domesticstaff to cater, clean and cook for this establishment. The premises consist of thecentral school, annexed buildings containing canteens and kitchens and nineteenseparate dwelling-houses, and P.W.E. are advised that a staff of approximately one hundred is required. Despite every effort to obtain A.T.S. or F.A.N.Ys. orother kinds of controlled labour, none has been made available. And so it isimpossible for the school to begin work.3. Meanwhile, General Eisenhower, who attaches great importance to political warfare, has begun to organise a Political Warfare unit similar to thatvhich served under him in the Mediterranean. Five hundred or more whollyuntrained Americans have already been selected for this unit. Some have reached,this country. No doubt in due course a smaller British contingent, equallyuntrained, will be similarly allocated.4.   I believe that much trouble to our cause will come of attaching to theOverlord&apos;&apos; Forces and letting loose in Western Europe a predominantlyAmerican Political Warfare unit which is quite untrained.5. I therefore ask that A.T.S. or F.A.N.Ys. should be appointed as domesticstaff for this establishment without further delay. The matter is urgent if thescheme, vhich provides for the training of a total of 600 students before D-day,is to be carried out ir time.B.
