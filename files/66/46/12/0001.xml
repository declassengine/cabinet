(44) 62.2W February, 1944.WAR CABINET.WITHDRAWAL OF CIVIL STAFFS  FROM service departments.Note by the Secretary.BY direction of the Prime Minister I circulate, for the consideration of theWar Cabinet, a copy of a Minute addressed to him as Prime Minister and Ministerof Defence, by the Service Ministers.E. E. BRIDGES.Offices of the War Cabinet,2nd February, 1944.Minute addressed to the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence by the service ministers.ON the 31st December last the Lord President&apos;s Committee consideredproposals of the Minister of Labour and National Service to obtain &apos;&apos; additional L p- ^ 280-women for urgent high priority work of National importance.&quot; These proposalsentail the withdrawal from Government Departments, without prior substitution,of young female clerks starting with those born in 1923, subject to the proviso that Departments may submit to Lord Kennet&apos;s Committee proposals for theindividual exemption of women who possess special qualifications or fill Keyposts or whose withdrawal &apos;&apos; would seriously impair the efficiency of the work ofthe Department.&quot;2. Concurring in these proposals the Chancellor of the Exchequerrecorded the opinion that &quot; the (Kennet) Committee may have to recommend an l.p. (43)283.almost total exemption for the girls of this age employed in some Depart-ments, perhaps in all,&quot; and expressed himself as &quot; exceedingly doubtful whether,whatever happens to the 1923 class girls in the Civil Service, it will be possibleto contemplate any further such withdrawals.&quot;3.   The Service Ministers agreed generally with the Chancellors views but were unanimous in considering that the Service Departments ought to be grantedtotal exemption now, without reference to the Kennet Committee.   Representa- l.p. (43) 288.tions to this effect were made by the First Lord in a paper submitted on behalfof all three Departments.4.   On the 31st December the Lord Presidents Committee decided that the l.p.(43)Service Departments could not be exempted, from the application of the Scheme   77th Mtg-and approved the Minister of Labour&apos;s proposals.5. We have come to the conclusion, for the reasons given below, that we ought not to accept this decision without reference to you as Prime Ministerand Minister of Defence.6. The incidence of this threat to the efficiency of our several deparment is assessed with some particularity in letters which we have addressed to the deputy Prime Minister since the decision of the Lord Presidents Committee wastaken, and of which copies are attached to this memorandum.*   Our general* Annexes I, II and III.[26823]
ground of appeal is the claim, applicable to us all, that a time when the three services are preoccupied with the imminence of a vast operational undertaking which may prove to be the very peak of the war effort, is no time for subjectingthe Service Departments to any avoidable loss of efficiency whatever; and that lossof efficiency will be the inevitable result of any measure involving the withdrawalof young and active clerks who know their work.7. If this claim is accepted it is our opinion that there is no room forconsideration of individual cases by the Kennet Committee, or any other bodywho can have no responsibility for the administrative results of their decisions.Moreover, it cannot be denied that the cumbersome process of representation tothe Kennet Committee on behalf of individuals, or even of groups, will absorb an appreciable amount of effort which ought, especially in the Service departments at this time, to be devoted to more positive objects.A. V. A.P. J. G.A. H. M. S.28th January, 1944.ANNEX I.Copy of a letter from the First Lord of the Admiralty to the Deputy PrimeMinister dated 6th January, 1944.Since the meeting of the Lord Presidents Committee last Friday I havere-examined the question of withdrawing women of the 1923 age class from theAdmiralty, and remain of the opinion that this measure might well lead to direresults.2. I was perhaps not ready enough in meeting the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s argument that, as the Service departments had been exempted fromthe scope of the enquiry carried out by the Committee on the Reduction ofNational Government staffs, they ought to be included in the present comb-out.The answer surely is, that the reasons which made it expedient to exempt service departments on the earlier occasion apply with even greater force now, and thattheir previous exemption strengthens their case for the continuance of the treat-ment meted out to them before. In this connection I would draw attention to thePrime Minister&apos;s memorandum on Man-power of the 28th November, 1942(W.P. (42) 556) wherein he enunciated the principle in paragraph 10 that &quot;thework of the central departments of Government must not be deranged for the sake of getting a few hundred highly trained individuals on to the barrack square.&quot;3. I am not sure, moreover, that I made the committee fully understand howgreatly the work of the departments in which these women are employed is bound up with operational efficiency. Of the 780 members of the Admiralty andoutport staff affected by the Ministry of Labour&apos;s scheme, no less than 300 are inthe Supply departments; and when I say &apos;&apos; Supply departments &quot; I do not meanagencies for procurement only, but services responsible for the distribution ofsupplies to His Majesty&apos;s Ships, and for their maintenance as well as for the procurement of the supplies. The staff in these departments might properly be described as personnel on the &quot;lines of communication,&quot; performing duties which in the Army would be carried out by the R.A.O.C. and R.A.S.C. and otherpurely military agencies. The rest of the women are distributed among thetechnical departments whose work is analogous to that of the supply departments and no less vital, among the divisions of the Naval Staff whose work isoperational, and among other departments and establishments engaged in dutiesancillary thereto-,4. A serious defect in the Minister of Labour&apos;s scheme is likely to appearshould substitution prove to be inadequate in quality or quantity. In any casethe process proposed leaves a gap in the efficiency of the departments concerned.If departments are subjected to this additional strain in the midst of the prepara-tions for &quot;Overlord,&quot; and for the opening of the Far Eastern campaign, theresult may well prove to be disastrous. Even if we are forced to draft into these departments uniformed staff to fill the gaps caused by the projected withdrawalsin spite of the previously accepted policy against this&apos;course, any such staff wouldhave to be worked into the job and loss of efficiency could not be avoided.
5. I am sending copies of this letter to Sinclair and G-rigg. As theAdmiralty, and no doubt the other Service departments also, regard this as aserious matter from the point of view of operational efficiency, I should be glad toknow if you would agree that a final decision on this question should be subject tothe Prime Minister&apos;s approval, especially as it seems to me that the total numbersof women involved in the three Service departments would have no real effect onthe Minister of Labour&apos;s problem. All that would be gained by the projectedcomb-out would be slight additional mobility in return for weakening of theefficiency of the fighting departments at a time when every military considerationrequires that they should be at their best.(Signed) A. V. ALEXANDER.Admiralty, S.W. 1.ANNEX II.Copy of a Letter from the Secretary of State for Air to the Deputy PrimeMinister dated 10th January, 1944.Alexander has sent me a copy of his letter to you of the 6th Januaryabout the proposal to withdraw&quot; the 1923 class women from GovernmentDepartments.2. I want most strongly to support what he says about the serious effect thatthe withdrawal of these women from the Service Departments would have onthe efficiency of those Departments.3. It is perhaps natural that a proposal to deal specially with the service departments in a matter of this kind should tend to give rise to some resentment,but it cannot be too strongly emphasised that it is the nature of the work, andthe conditions under which it has to be performed, which compels the service departments to ask for special treatment. Working conditions in the service departments are necessarily more exacting than they are in most other Depart-ments because of the operational duties with which the former are entrusted.These compel some of their branches to work regular day and night shifts; andin the other branches the hours tend to be longer than in other GovernmentDepartments.4. A point which is often overlooked in connection with the staffing difficultiesof the Service Departments is that they have had to be very rapidly expandedin the years just before the war and during the war. The result is that theaverage length of experience of the staff is a good deal shorter than it is inmany of the other Government Departments, and the difficulties arising fromthis have been accentuated by the release of young men and women to the Forces.In the Air Ministry we have already lost about a thousand efficient members ofthe staff in this way, and 50 more women were withdrawn recently in connectionwith the scheme under which we were asked to release as many women as possiblebetween the ages of 20 and 30.5. The corresponding figures for the out-stations are not readily available, butthe difficulties in regard to. the large proportion of comparatively inexperiencedstaff and the loss of trained staff to the Forces are much the same at the out-stations as they are at Headquarters.6. During the last year we have been very hard put to it to fill our wastagevacancies at both the Head Office and the out-stations. Not only has there been much delay in filling them, but we have been compelled to accept candidates whowere below the minimum standard which would normally be insisted upon. Wehave also had to make do with a lot of part-timers whose employment is veryuneconomical. Recently our recruits have consisted mainly of young girls (whoremain with us for only short periods) and married women aged 40 and upwards.We certainly cannot afford in the near future to lose another 360 of the mostactive and efficient members of the Headquarters&apos; Staff. We are already carryingon under great difficulties.7. If the release of these 360 women were insisted upon we should almost certainly be compelled to replace a considerable number of them by W.A.A.Fs.;and clearly we should not be helping to remedy the shortage of mobile womenif we released civilian mobiles merely to replace them by mobiles in uniform.Moreover, if it became necessary to fill civilian vacancies by W.A.A.Fs., thenumber of W.A.A.Fs. required would be greater than the number of civilians
released. It has to be remembered, too, that these frequent changes in staff are extremely wasteful because much effort has to be devoted to training of clerkswho remain with us only for short periods.8. For these reasons I feel bound to press, as Alexander does, for the service departments to be exempted from the call-up of the 1923 women, or alternativelyfor the matter to be reserved for the Prime Ministers decision.(Signed) ARCHIBALD SINCLAIR.Air Ministry, S.W 1,ANNEX III.Copy of a letter from the Secretary of State for War to the Deputy PrimeMinister dated 18th January, 1944.1. I have read Alexanders letter to you dated the 6th January, andSinclair&apos;s dated the 10th, about the question of withdrawing women of the 1923class without prior substitution and I should like you to know the position in theWar Office and the Departments establishments in the Home Commands if suchwomen are taken away.2. For some time we have had serious difficulty in obtaining suitable officecivilian labour, both at headquarters and in Commands, and in some cases I havehad to allow soldier and A.T.S. office staff to be employed in the absence of civilians. The preparations for operations have involved an ever-increasing demand for such civilian labour, and this demand is increased by the absolutenecessity for releasing soldiers and A.T.S. now employed in offices for duties withthe Army in the field.3. At the War Office (Headquarters) there are over 200 women of the 1923class employed on clerical duties and of this number about half are serving in military branches directly concerned with military operational activities. Theremainder are employed on duties inter-related with operational branches. In allcases the women concerned have been employed for some considerable time and have acquired experience and a knowledge of the organisations, &amp;c, with which theyare concerned. I am satisfied that it would be impracticable to replace them, evenif they could be replaced at all without a serious handicap at a time when thesmooth running of the branches may make all the difference between success and failure of the services involved. I cannot stress this position too strongly, forgenerally these girls are among the most efficient of the clerks.4. As regards the Outstations (War Department Establishments in Com-mands) women clerks are mainly employed in Record and Pay Offices and Store(Ordnance, &amp;c.) Depots. At these establishments numbers of soldiers and A.T.S.have all along been employed where it was not practicable to use civilian clerks,but their numbers have been reduced to the minimum compatible with service requirements as the result of repeated combings from time to time. You will appreciate at once that military operations are directly dependent on the servicescarried out by Records, &amp;c, Offices and Store Depots. They are, in fact, essentialbases on which operations depend and I feel that the taking away of the 1923women would jeopardise the efficiency of the establishments just at a time whenit is of paramount importance.5. I am satisfied that the only result of taking the 1923 women away fromtheir employment in the War Office and Command Establishments would be to weaken efficiency for the doubtful benefit of additional mobility, and I hope youwill agree to Alexander&apos;s proposal that a final decision on this question should besubject to the Prime Ministers approval.(Signed) P. J. GRIGG.War Office, S.W. 1.
