THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S (X3VERNMENTSECRETW.P. (4U)56.2bth January 19kkcCOPY NO.   dOWAR CABINETr1rcifcranccsconclusionsADDITIONAL PHOSPHATE SHIPMENTS FOR THE DOMINIONSMemorandum       the Minister of War transport the War Cabinet decided on 20th December that the american authorities should be asked to provide vessels to ship &quot;by the  &apos;end of March 281fOOO tons of additional rock phosphate zo&quot;Australia and New Zealand, and that pending the result of thenegotiations no arrangements should &quot;be made by me to ship anyof this quantity, or of the additional 37,000 tons required bySouth Africa,,I took up the question immediately with the War ShippingAdministration,     So far no progress has been made, for thereason that the Administration is unable to come to anyconclusion or to enlarge its commitments until a decision has-been reached on the revised &quot;ANVIL&quot; and &quot;OVERLO^RD&quot; proposals.We are being strongly urged, by the AustralianCommonwealth Government in particular, for a decision on thephosphate question.      It has been impressed on me thatAustralian farmers must have an immediate assurance regardingsuper-phosphate supplies for 2.Skh/k5 in order that they mayplan production on a scale appropriate to demands on australia for foodstuffs.Some part of the extra shipping needed will eventuallyhave to be found from our resources, and as the shipments haveto be made by March if they are to be available for the corningseason in Australia and as i\ takes time to move shipping in1,position, I propose now to allocate additional tonnage to liftabout 75*000 tons as soon as possible.I should be glad to know whether my colleagues approve^L.Ministry of War Transport,26th January, 13kk*
