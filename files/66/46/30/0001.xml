DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  February 1944. 173SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 80.ith February, 1944.WAR CABINET.RED ARMY DAY 1944.Memorandum by the Minister of Information.THE Ministry of Information has now had an opportunity of working Outdetailed proposals for the celebration of Red Army Day on the 23rd February,and of consulting the other Departments likely to be concerned. It will be recalled that on the 29th November, 1943 (W.M. (43) 163rd Conclusions, Item 3), the WarCabinet decided that it wished to have official celebrations of this day, thoughon a less elaborate scale than last year.The following arrangements are now being made : 1. Official action is to be confined to London, Edinburgh, Cardiff andBelfast. This will mean that troops are not lent or other forms of Governmentrecognition or assistance given to ceremonies outside those cities or to ceremoniesin those cities other than the official ones.2. London. Considering the time of the year and the practical impossi-bility of combining a parade outside the Albert Hall with a ceremony in theAlbert Hall, we have to concentrate on a meeting in the Albert Hall. Theprogramme will consist simply of music by massed bands, choirs and orchestra,with an invited audience picked to represent each section of the British people.The meeting is intended to last for about an hour and three-quarters and toinclude a single speech in honour of the Red Army, which the Home secretary has agreed to deliver.3. Edinburgh and Cardiff. There is to be a ceremony in each city on some-what the same lines, subject to local variations .but with the guarantee of a leading spokesman on behalf of the Government. The Secretary of State for Airhas promised to speak at Edinburgh and I am in course of arranging for a speaker at Cardiff. According to the advice that I have received, large-scaleparades on such an occasion would not be well taken, at any rate in the absenceof any corresponding official recognition of the achievements of our own fighting forces during the &apos;ast year.4. Belfast. By local agreement a parade is being organised at which theFirst Lord of the Admiralty will take the salute, but no meeting is contemplated.B.
