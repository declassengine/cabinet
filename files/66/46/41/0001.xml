THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  February 1944.secret. I Copy NoW.P. (44) 91.7th February, 1944.WAR CABINET.SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS OF BOMBER COMMAND FOR FORT-NIGHT ENDING 30th JANUARY, 1944.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.THREE heavy attacks were made on Berlin; Magdeburg was raided in force for the first time; large mine-laying operations were carried out on two nights.Summary of Operations. , .      ,.J       - A %r craftTarget.

Towards theend of the attack a large spiral of smoke was seen rising to 25,000 feet. reports from intelligence sources indicate that this raid was one of the most damagingcarried out on the capital.Photographs of good quality were obtained the following day (see print. 1), but unfortunately only cover an area in the north-west of the city around the docks where the districts of Wedding and Tiergarten adjoin. They do not cover the eastern and south-eastern parts of the city, which have been attacked,and hit since the last photographs obtained on the 21st December. They arevaluable, since they confirm and amplify items of important damage which were previously doubtful owing to the poor quality of the photographs. They alsoindicate that roof repairs are taking place to the Siemens and B.M.W. Works.Cloud conditions were generally favourable for the second raid on the27th/28th January. Mosquito pilots who bombed after the main attack reportedthat several large areas of fire could be seen through the clouds.The attack on the following night appears to have been most successful. Bythe end of the raid many fires were seen to have merged into a single very largeconflagration which was visible from well beyond Rostock on the return journey.Magdeburg (21st/22nd January).Crew reports indicate that several big explosions and substantial fires were seen, but that the attack was scattered towards the south of the town.Results of Previous Raids.Berlin.Only incomplete information is available on the results of the seven most recent attacks (23rd and 29th December, 1st 2nd, 20th, 27th and 28th January).[26885] &quot;
It is clear, however, from extensive reports received from Intelligence sources aswell as from the disclosures of neutrals that the destruction is already on acatastrophic scale and that virtually no area of the city has escaped. A veryconservative estimate made before the last three attacks put the devastation at30 per cent, of the heavily built-up area and 20 per cent, of the suburbs. Thereis strong evidence that the east, north-east and south-east parts of the city, whichescaped comparatively lightly in the first attacks but were the main targets inthe later ones, have now been very heavily hit.Industrial damage is known to have been severe though comparatively fewdetails are available. Important works which have suffered include the aircraft and Aero-engine Repair Works in Adlershof, the Knorr Bremse Works inRummelsburg (compressed air brakes), the Osram and Auer Works (electric bulbsand gas masks) and the Siemens Works in Lichtenberg. Destruction of transport and public utilities is on such a scale that industrial production must have suffered severely.Frankfurt.An immediate interpretation of photographs taken after the attack on the20th/&apos;21st December shows that damage, both to business and residential property and to industry, is concentrated mainly in the south-eastern district of Offenbach.Amongst factories severely damaged are : Neubecher A.G. (Engineering), Offenbach.Ludwig Becker G.m.b.H. (Engineering), Offenbach.Westdeutsche Bleifarben (Chemicals), Offenbach.Mueller and Kurth (Engineering), Offenbach.Adler Junior (Scrap Metal), E. Frankfurt.Mayfahrt and Co. (Engineers) and Telefon und Normalzeit (Telephones) havereceived-some damage.Stettin.An immediate interpretation of photographs taken after the attack on the5th/6th January, which cover only part of the town, shows that damage is concen-trated in the southern area extending into the east and west basins of the docks.The main railway station buildings are some 75 per cent, gutted and large ware-houses in the dock area have been destroyed or seriously damaged. Ten buildings of the large military barracks south of the town centre are gutted, whilst morethan half the buildings of the Portland Cement Company have been destroyedby fire. The greatest damage, however, has occurred just north of the railway bridge, where lies the oldest and most congested part of the town, comprisingbusiness and commercial property and the town&apos;s main shopping street.Ground sources -have reported that damage has been caused also in thesubmarine building yards which were not covered by the photographs.*Mining.It was hoped to confuse the enemy defences by combining a large miningeffort in the Heligoland Bight with the twelfth major assault on Berlin on the27th/28th January. 60 minelaying Stirlings therefore accompanied the mainforce across the North Sea and then proceeded to the Heligoland area. 269 mines were successfully laid without loss.On the following night another large minelaying operation was carried outby Stirlings in Kiel Fjord and off the Denmark coast. The Stirlings were sent out 3^ hours before the main force, and used the same route to Berlin, breakingoff just north of Kiel Fjord. The operation was successful and 130 mines were laid.Air Ministry, 7th February, 1944.A. H. M. S.
