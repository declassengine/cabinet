THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.LORD HALIFAX&apos;S SPEECH IN TORONTO.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, the following exchange of telegrams with the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Ottawa regardingCanadian reactions to the speech made by Lord Halifax in Toronto on the24th January....      &apos;. . :    :,; . . - ... .    . C.Dominions Office, 29th January, 1944.SECRET. Copy No.       35W.P. (44) 67. ^2vth January, 1944.WAR CABINET.Deputy High Commissioner to Dominions Office.(25th January, 1944.)(No. 240.)Press reactions to Lord Halifax &apos;s speech at Toronto on 24th will be tele-graphed as soon as provincial papers are available. Feel that you would wish to hear at once how Department of External Affairs and Wartime InformationBoard are thinking. There are two main lines of comment which interlock.Officials fear that reaction of main body of Canadian press will be unfavourableand will be bound to link proposals up with General Smuts&apos;s statement last november. Although officials may themselves personally agree that close scrutiny of Lord Halifax&apos;s words reveals no sinister meaning, they nevertheless expect that large sections of the press will read into them the expression of a wish by theUnited Kingdom to take charge of and become the mouthpiece of a unifiedCommonwealth foreign policy, thus calling in question the independence ofCanada, and the other Dominions. Second line of comment is that exception to the foregoing press reaction will no doubt be the Toronto press whichis habitual advocate of closer contact with Britain. This may, however, inits turn be unfortunate, since papers in question are-supporters of Colonel Drew,the Progressive-Conservative Premier of Ontario and outspoken critic ofMackenzie King&apos;s Government. To the extent that Colonel Drew succeeds inappropriating Lord Halifax&apos;s words as his own, the rest of Canada will see in them an endeavour by the United Kingdom to influence Canadian opinion behind the backs of the present Liberal Government. It is feared that comment will bemade that speech, delivered as it was on Canadian soil by a member of the UnitedKingdom War Cabinet, constituted unwarranted interference in Canadian affairs..Foregoing is sent at once and before opportunity of consultation with High Com-missioner, who is to-day making a speech in Montreal, has been possible. He will no doubt wish to telegraph further on his return to Ottawa.[26812]
:.     Dominions Office to High Commissioner.(27th Jauuarv, 1944.)(No. 257.)Your telegram 25th January, No. 240.Massey has spoken to me emphasising the points made in Duffs message.It seems to me very desirable that it should be made clear that there is noquestion of Lord Halifax having been authorised to make an official statementof policy on behalf of the Government. Thus press messages from Canada, e.g.,in Times constantly refer to the speech as having put forward &quot; british proposals.&quot; All that Lord Halifax did, as I myself did in my Guildhall speech,was to underline some of the obvious considerations affecting the Commonwealthsystem which seemed to call for study and discussion having regard to Mr. Curtin&apos;spronouncements. There has been no question of pressing any particular UnitedKingdom view, and it has always been made clear by us that matter was essentially one for discussion between all the Governments concerned, on a basisof full equality.Should be glad of your views generally, and,, in particular, if you could tellus whether, in your opinion, there is any action which it would be useful for you to take either publicly or with Mackenzie King to try to dispel any unfoundedsuspicions which may have been raised.High Commissioner to Dominions Office.(27th January, 1944.)(No. 261.   Secret.)Repeated to Embassy, Washington, No. 4.-   My telegram No. 240.Press and other opinion in Canada about Lord Halifax&apos;s Toronto speechseems to be crystallising along the lines indicated in my telegram under reference.I have reported a cross section of detailed press comments in my immediately preceding telegram and am. reporting comments by political leaders in my immediately following telegrams Nos. 262 and 2632. It would be as much a mistake to pay too great heed to the criticalopinions expressed as it would be to pay too little heed to them. Such animportant speech made in Canada by a British representative of Lord Halifax&apos;authority has naturally aroused a great deal of comment. A certain amount ofwildness has been added to the comment by two circumstances. First,&apos;&apos; Nationalist &apos;&apos; opinion here is in one of its touchy moods, following on therecent speeches by Smuts, Curtin and others. It regards with quite unwarrantedsuspicion appeals for unity in the policies of the various Commonwealth Govern-ments. Secondly, the question of the appropriate machinery for ensuringCommonwealth co-operation has unfortunately become a matter of party politicshere, with the Progressive Conservatives generally supporting such proposals as mr. Curtin and others have made, and the Liberals and Co-operative Common-wealth Federation supporting the traditional Mackenzie King policy of leaving the machinery of consultation, &amp;c, on its present rather informal basis. the progressive Conservatives have begun a strong attack on the Government on thismatter and the prospect of a general election some time in the next twelve monthsnaturally makes the discussion more heated than it would otherwise be.3. Needless to say, many of the critics of Lord Halifax&apos;s speech have notread it and are criticising isolated sentences and ideas in it without referenceto other sentences and ideas which balanced his general argument. already the controversy is dying down though it may revive when the matter is discussed in Parliament probably at the beginning of next week.4. Criticism would have been more violent than it is if almost anyone exceptXord Halifax had made the speech. He is held in very high regard by Canadiansand especially by the French Canadians, who would normally be the bitterestcritics of parts of the speech. When Lord Halifax received a degree from LavalUniversity, Quebec, a few months ago he made a speech which I have hearddescribed by leading French Canadians as &quot; the noblest utterance ever made byan Englishman in Canada.&quot; The profound and permanent impression made bythat speech is tempering the criticism of the Toronto speech.
5. When the immediate emotions aroused by the speech have cooled off and discussion becomes calm and reasonable I have no doubt that the speech(though still meeting with disagreement from many Canadians) will have donegood in making Canadians think more realistically about the Commonwealth.High Commissioner to Dominions Office.(27th January, 1944.)(No. 262.)Repeated to Embassy, Washington, No. 5, Secret.1. Immediately after publication of Lord Halifax&apos;s speech, the Presssought the opinions of political leaders on it.2. Prime Minister is reserving any statement until the matter is discussed in Parliament.3. Mr. Bracken (Progressive-Conservative Leader), in a non-committalstatement, urged that proposals should not become subject of political controversyand contented himself with saying that following meeting of Prime ministers in London he expected Mackenzie King would make known to people of Canadawhat he considered the best road for this nation to follow.4. Mr. Coldwell (Co-operative Commonwealth Federation Leader) issuedstatement expressing his belief that genius of British Commonwealth had beenrecognition of basic unity in disunity. Mr. Coldwell stated Lord Halifaxproposed to abandon these principles and committed Commonwealth to unitedstand. He added : &quot; I would not like to see Canada committed to Tory-mindedColonial and Foreign policy. The new proposal seems to me to be particularlydangerous form of isolation.&quot;5. Mr. Blackniore (New Democracy Leader) also issued statement that major problem confronting post-war world would be that of distribution, and commentedthat Lord Halifax had not given even a hint of suggestion of how to solve this problem, adding, unless British peoples head way to prepare adequate distributionof goods, it is impossible for us to play &apos;&apos; our rightful part in preservation ofpeace &quot; mentioned by Ambassador.6.&quot; M. Chaloult (Bloc Populaire member in Quebec Assembly) has given notice of motion asking Provincial House to express its divergence as regardsLord Halifax&apos;s &quot;new imperialism and its dangerous tendencies.&quot;High Commissioner to Dominions Office.(27th January, 1944.)(No. 263.   Secret.)Repeated to Embassy, Washington, No. 6, Secret.I had a talk with Mackenzie King yesterday about Lord Halifax&apos;s speech.I had heard from various of his advisers that on the previous day (when I was absent in Montreal) he was furiously angry. He expressed his opinions very strongly in an interview with the Governor-General. Yesterday he was, on hisown admission, a good deal calmer though he still feels very upset.2. His feelings are more ruffled than they would otherwise be because of theuse which some Progressive-Conservative Leaders like Colonel Drew are making of it to attack the Government on one side, and the use which Mr. Coldwell of theC.C.F. is making of it to steal Nationalist votes from the Government on the other.He said to me that he was in a difficult position because many of his supporters would like him to express strong criticism of the speech, on the Coldwell lines.He was glad that Parliament had not been sitting on the previous day, and thathe therefore avoided making a public statement. Otherwise he probably wouldhave said something intemperate. The matter would, be raised in Parliament,and he would have to make a statement on Monday. He thought he wouldprobably make a non-committal statement rather on the lines of Mr. Bracken&apos;s.He said that he would probably write the statement out beforehand, so that he wasnot led by any possible controversy in the House into saying something which hehad not thought out carefully.
3. Apart from some criticism of the content of the speech he gave two reasons for his resentment at it. First, it looked to him like part of a deliberatedesign by the United Kingdom Government and some Dominion statesmen to revive an imperialism which left the Dominions something less than nationalsovereignty. I did my best to disabuse him of this idea. In the first place I pointed out that Lord Halifax&apos;s speech itself had indicated clearly in more thanone place that the essential basis of co-operation in the Commonwealth was thepreservation of the national sovereignty of each Dominion. The only question was how they exercised their sovereignty. Secondly I assured him that theUnited Kingdom Government were not engaged in any deliberate design to forceone view or another on any Dominion. They had an open mind on the wholequestion pending discussion with the Prime Ministers in London later in theyear. The United Kingdom Government would only finally determine their policyin the light of those discussions.4. The Prime Ministers second contention Avas that Lord FIalifax&apos;&quot;s speechhad amounted to an attack on his personal position. Lord Halifax must haveknown that he, Mackenzie King, would not agree with some of the principalviews he expressed, and that those views would be used against him by his political opponents. Again I tried to disabuse him of this notion. I told him that I happened to know from many talks with Lord Halifax that he felt a verywarm regard for him (Mackenzie King) as a man, and great admiration for him as a statesman. In common with all his colleagues in the War Cabinet, lord halifax thought that his leadership of a united Canada into and through the war had been an achievement of unique value to the whole cause for wdiich we were fighting. ; Moreover, Lord Halifax had actually paid a public tribute to him inthis very Toronto speech. I thought the tribute pretty good meat to serve up to aToronto audience. Mackenzie King interrupted to say that he had not seen this,as it was not in any press report. When I quoted the exact reference, he showedgreat pleasure and remarked that Lord Halifax&apos;s words were kind and generous.5. Nevertheless, the speech has, quite unwarrantably, put the Prime Ministerinto one of his worst moods. As usual on such occasions he talked of going to thecountry and fighting a General Election on it. He said he certainly would havedone this if it had been peace-time.6. He is, of course, looking for a slogan which will win him the next election,and one which resisted &apos;&apos; reactionary imperialism &apos;&apos; would undoubtedly help to dothe trick. So much is this so that some Progressive-Conservative leaders feelapprehensive at the speech&apos;s potentialities as a weapon in Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;shands. This is the chief explanation of Mr. Bracken&apos;s cautious press statement on the subject. It is also probably the chief explanation of Mr. ColdwelFs veryincautious statement, which was almost certainly made before he had read any-thing but a few extracts from the speech. All this is very disappointing. Itindicates that Canadian politicians are still capable of moods in which they donot do themselves justice as leaders of a mature democratic nation. The realthing which bedevils such situations as this is the bitterness of party politics here.However, the discussion will almost certainly calm down in the next few days.Dominions Office to High Commissioner.(28th January. 1944.)(No. 271.   Secret and Personal.)My telegram No. 257. Many thanks for your telegrams Nos. 261, 262and 263. I am very grateful for the helpful action you have taken and hope, likeyou, that the controversy aroused will now subside. Accordingly I do not propose any further action, unless new developments should seem to request it, when I will consult you further.
