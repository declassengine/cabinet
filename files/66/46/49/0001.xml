248 v/(THIS &apos; DOCUMENT IS THE  -PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)S E C R E T11TH FEBRUARY,  19UU&quot;COPY NO.WAR CABINETINDIAN POODGRAIN REQUIREMENTSReport &quot;by the President of the Board of education the War Cabinet,  at their meeting on the 7th February1944,  (V7cMc  (hi!-) 16th Conclusions, Minute 7)  appointed aCommittee consisting of myself (in the absence of theSecretary of State for India)  the Minister of Food,,  theMinister of War Transport?  and. the Paymaster General, toexamine further the request of the Government of India for continued importations of foodgrainss  with particular reference to the statistical basis of the case set out inthe Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India(W.P.. (JLdi)&apos;oj pThe Committee has met and agreed to prime Minister in the following termsi-report to theThe Committee accepted&apos; the figures given by thePrime Minister in&quot;the Cabinet as being in accordanceWith the data available*      It was agreed however that thereare inevitably a variety of reasons why Indian statisticsmust always be in doubt.      The Government of India,  towhom a summary of the considerations leading up to theCabinet Conclusions of the 7th February had been telegraphed,had defended the figures which they had used,  and theViceroy&apos;s reply on this to - this report.      It is subject is contained in an annexurehowever, not on statistics alonethat the Government of.Indi;:&apos;demand for imports is based.It was felt to be a hopeful feature of the situation that a considerable fresh acreagebeen planted with rice this year,crop put forward by the Government(h&quot;? million acres) hadThe. estimate of theof India was consideredAtthisto have made allowance for a low yield per acrestage the Government of India were not iDrepared to go&apos; beyond their forecast of 26 million tons of rice, nor wasthe President of the Board of Education in a- position to quote any higher figure?      The general view of theCommittee:. howevers was that since the reports about therice, harvest have been good a more normal-yield might&quot;be&quot; expected., which would give something like 2 million tons more than the Government of India.&apos;s estimate.      If .conditions of transport in India allow, this extra supply will be available for consumption^ although the whole of itmay not reach the urban consumer0      The Committee&apos;s general conclusion was that if these extra two million tons became,availabler :no actual deficit should occur, i especially inview of the Viceroy&apos;s sterling efforts to curb inflationarytendencieso      This extra, tonnage might indeed eventuallyprovide the reserve on which the Viceroy is depending tocontrol the prices of food by means of the new measureswhich he hi its elf has initiatedo

3.    The Committee considered the needs arising fromthe presence of additional defence personnel in thecountry and from the requirements of India as a- potential &quot;base for the S.E.A. operations.      Theimportance of these considerations was fully&apos; accepted,km    The Minister of War Transport gave it as his mostsolemn opinion that additional shipping requirementsneeded for strategic purposes, some of which have &quot;been imposed upon him quite.recently, made it impossible for him to contemplate providing shipping from British on.S. sources to cover the haul from Australia to India*In the circumstances the Minister of War Transport,considered that it was impossible for him to contemplate-the-continuation of the imports of wheat from Australiainto India, even at their present rate.      He suggested,however, that provided Iraqi &quot;barley could be used togood advantage by India he could, in conjunction withthe Minister of Pood, provide for the shipment ofpossibly 50,000 tons of this barley to Indian ports.The Minister of Food undertook to examine whether this amount could not be screwed up to as much as 80,000 tons,5.    It was agreed that in these circumstances the Ministerof War Transport would provide shipping for the riceneeds of Ceylon throughout the year if it should notbe possible to procure them from India, although theMinister of Pood could make no promise of findingsupplies from other sources before July,6.    The Committee felt obliged to o.accept -the position as stated by the Minister of War Transport with such. .mitigation as was afforded by his offer to do his .best with shipments of Iraqi barley.(Int&apos;d) R.A.B.11TH FEBRUARY,   19UU.AWNEXUREIn reply to a telegraphic summary of the_considerationsleading up to the Cabinet conclusions of 7th February, theViceroy has telegraphed as below:-&quot;Bengal famine was one of the greatest disastersthat has. befallen any people under British rule- and damage to our reputation here both amongst Indians andforeigners in India - you are better able to judge theeffect at home and abroad - is incalculable, .2.    Attempt by His Majesty&apos;s Government tc prove on the&quot;basis of admittedly defective statistics that we ean dowitho\.it help demanded would be regarded here &quot;by allopinion British and Indian as utterly indefensible.Please warn your colleagues once more that rigidstatistical approach is futile and that my views are based on personal discussions with all Governors andvisits to seven of the eleven Provinces.

3*    Argument summarised in your paragraph No. 5 isstatistically fallacious for three reasons.      First.Carry over from year to year is unknown.  .   the probability is that cultivators&apos;  stocks are less now than pre-war.      Second.    In 1936-37 and 1937-38, thetwo years immediately before the series of yearsquoted,  the net amounts available for consumption.averaged 55*8 million tons or half a million tonsabove present estimated needs. ThircU Population increase from 1938-39 to 19^4-3-19^!- inclusive must be of orderof 30 million justifying increase in consumption of order of four million tons, over consumption of 1938-1939*i+o    I am quite satisfied that on figures alone ourdemands are justified,,      But psychological aspect isof even greater importance^      In every Province I havevisited there is insistence of opinion official and non-official that only hope of solving India&apos;s foodproblem is firm control by Central Government, and. &apos;there is growing confidence in power of CentralGovernment to do so, provided it has at its commandsubstantial reserve of imported grain,.      This provisohas been made in every single instance.      announcement that such a reserve would be available would have an.immediate and saluto.ry effect on prices everywhereand would do more than anything to stabilise India&apos;seconomy0      On the contrary once it is known thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government is not prepared to help India,and I do not see how the fact can be concealed sinceamount of grain imparts is a question closely studied,I fear that all our work at control of past months,which has had consideraole success, will he lost,prices of grain and of all other commodities will rise,  and situation may pass out of controlsn .-3-
