THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944./SECRET. Copy No.     21W.P. (44) 65.28th January, 1944.WAR CABINET.SUMMARY OE OPERATIONS OF BOMBER COMMAND FOR FORT-NIGHT ENDING 16th JANUARY, 1944.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.BERLIN, Stettin and Brunswick were raided in force; the full moon periodprevented large-scale attacks (except that on Brunswick) during the second halfof the period under review.Summary of Operations.Target.BerlinNorthern FranceStettinBrunswick  ...Northern FranceDate.2/3   Januarv4/5  -     ,,5/614/1514/15A ircraftDespatched.3838035849882In addition, 191 aircraft were despatched on small harassing raids on german towns and targets in Northern France and 428 mines were laid.Operations.Berlin (2nd/3rd January).Day photographs have not yet been obtained of the results achieved in thisraid, but reports indicate that the area affected was roughly oval in shape from east to west with two main areas of conflagration, the larger being towards theeast.Stettin (5th/6th January).Conditions were eminently suitable for a heavy attack by Lancasters on thisBaltic Port. Thick cloud prevailed em route to within about 30 miles of the target where there was a clear break with bright moonlight and excellentvisibility. Thirteen Mosquitoes had been sent to Berlin the previous night andthe same number were despatched this night; the enemy were temporarily deceivedas to the target, with the result that very few fighters or fighter flares were seenover Stettin until the end of the attack, whereas the route towards Berlin waswell illuminated.Photographs taken at the time of bombing appeared to indicate an exceptionally successf ul and concentrated attack. An immediate interpretation of the day photographs which have now been obtained does not, however, fullyconfirm this impression. Very considerable damage has been done to variousareas in the fully built-up part of the city. This damage would have beenconsidered outstanding by the standards of success which were applied to BomberCommandos attacks a year ago, but there is no uninterrupted area of totaldevastation such as those caused in recent attacks on Kassei or Hanover.Brunswick (14th/15th January).Brunswick, although comparatively small, is an important target since its main industry is the assembly of M.E. 110s and the manufacture of Daimler Benzaero-engines and component parts.   Clear weather was encountered en route, but[26805]
cloudy conditions were experienced over the target. Preliminary reports indicatethat bombing may have been scattered, but it is not possible to make any estimateof results until clay photographs have been obtained.Results of Previous Raids.Berlin.A final interpretation of the photographs taken on the 21st December confirms the vast amount of damage caused to all classes of property in previous raids.The greatest havoc covers an area of nearly 8 square miles, stretching fromthe East side of the central district of Berlin to Charlottenburg in the North-West and Wilmersdorf in the South-West where a number of complete blockshave been gutted. The principal districts affected are Tiergarten (residential,including most embassies and legations), Mitte (industrial, residential, Govern-nient and commercial offices), Wedding (industrial and workers&apos; living quarters),Charlottenburg (chiefly residential but industrial towards the North), Schbneberg(residential and industrial) and Wilmersdorf (mainly residential but someindustrial plant). Damage throughout the City is so vast that it is impossibleto enumerate it in detail. The following indicates the extent and the type of damage inflicted : (a) Industrial. There is damage to 98 identified industrial concerns,including Siemens Kabelwerke^ Siemens and Plalske A.G. and Rheinmetall-BorsigA.G. A considerable number of factories engaged in manufacturing aero-engines and aircraft components have been damaged, including B.M.W., Argus, Dornierand Heinkel, and included amongst factories producing electrical and wirelessequipment are Bergmann Elektrizitats A.G. and Dr. Cassirer. Other industriesdamaged cover a wide range of products, including vehicles of all types, engines,armaments, machine tools, precision tools, electrical equipment, chemicals, dyes,plastics, fabrics and food-stuffs. In addition to the 98 identified firms, damage has been caused to considerably more than 100 other industrial concerns.(b) Commercial. Over 100 commercial undertakings have received damage,of which 40 can be identified, including M/T depots, garages, buildingcontractors, timber merchants, printers, food wholesalers and warehouses of allkinds.(c) Transportation. Railway services most seriously affected are in thecentral area. The Lehrter and Potsdamer passenger stations are gutted and almost the entire group of railway buildings and warehouses at the Lehrter goods station, which is the terminus for the Berlin-Hamburg line, has been demolished.Railway carriage sheds and warehouses in the Anhalter and Potsdamer sidingsare gutted and there is also serious damage to the Stettiner and WriezenerStations and to the Spreeufer Goods Station.(d) Public Utilities. Damage has been caused to 39 public utilities,including four gas works and two gas storage depots. Seven water-works andpumping stations, 5 tramway depots and the main postal depots in the centralalso damaged.(e) State, Ministerial and Public Buildings. Well over 100 public buildings have been destroyed or damaged, including a number of legations and embassies,and the building containing the secret service headquarters of the three armed forces has been gutted. Other buildings deserving mention are the Ministry ofFood and Agriculture, the Ministry of Justice, the Foreign Office, the Treasury,the Ministry of Transport and buildings known to be the headquarters of the gestapo and the private residence of Himmler. Buildings which it is believedhoused the Ministry of Armaments and Munitions are gutted and a considerable part of the Home Office is burnt out. Other buildings of note receiving damageare the Army Records Office, the Ministry of Education and the Kroll OperaHouse, where Reichstag meetings are held.(f) Military and Hutted Camps. The military academy and artillerysehooi have both been badly hit and six barracks and several military storesdamaged.   In 25 hutted camps, 236 huts out of 483 have been destroyed.General. Up to the 16th/17th December at least 17 per cent, of all actualbuildings in the fully built-up and the 50-70 per cent, built-up areas of Berlinhad been destroyed or severely damaged.Leipzig.A final interpretation of photographs taken nearly three weeks after the attack on the 3rd/4th December shows that damage was even more severe than
previously assessed. In zones 40 per cent, or more built-up, 625 acres are nowseen to have been destroyed or damaged, the greater part in the fully built-up area, where 564 acres, or 30 per cent, of the whole, are affected.It can now also be stated that not a single one of the 17 large buildings in the former Leipzig World Fair engaged on production for the aircraft industry has escaped damage, most of them being destroyed, and about one-halfof the Erla Maschinenwerk (aircraft components) has been destroyed. In all,47 identified factories have been affected as well as 77 other unidentified industrialworks.Particular items of damage not previously mentioned include the Eilenburgersuburban station and the block of office buildings of the main railway administra-tion (opposite the main station), which are gutted. Both the old and newexchange, the Market Hall, and the old City Hall are destroyed and the DistrictOffice of the Nazi Labour Party is in ruins.Frankfurt.No day photographs have been obtained of Frankfurt since the attack on the20th/21st December, but it is now reported by a ground source that severe damage occurred in the centre of the City between the Opera House and theMain Post Office in the North and the river in the South. Along theBockenheimer Landstrasse, which is the main exit from the centre of the Citytowards the North-west, over three-quarters of the buildings are reporteddestroyed or uninhabitable for a considerable distance.Pleavy damage is also stated to have been caused to the residential districts of Bockenheim and Sachsenhausen (the latter of which is said to be four-fifthsdestroyed) and to the satellite town of Offenbach. In addition, most of the largewarehouses in the West Harbour were burnt out.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, 28th January, 1944.
