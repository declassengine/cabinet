THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HI3 BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1944.SECRET. \j Copy No.W.P. (44) 75.5th February, 1944.WAR CABINET.ANGLO-AMERICAN DISCUSSIONS UNDER ARTICLE VII.Note by the Minister of State.I was invited by the Cabinet on the 21st December, 1943, to prepare a reportfocussing for Ministerial decision the issues arising out of the recent Washingtonconversations. This I am doing in another paper (W.P. (44) 81). At thesame time, my colleagues were invited to send to me any questions which they wished to raise on this subject. Many of the questions which I have receivedI have attempted to answer at least by implication in my full report to theCabinet. But it would not have been possible for me to answer all thesequestions in proper detail in that report without unduly overloading it. I am,therefore, circulating the attached notes which attempt to deal more fully withthe precise points which my colleagues have raised.R. L.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,5th February, 1944.QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON THE RECENT WASHINGTONCONVERSATIONS ON ARTICLE VII.&quot; Will we be free to do everything which may benecessary to ensure full employment in this country,or will our hands be tied asregards national policy %&apos;&apos;(Minister of Labour and national Service.)&apos;&apos; Above all we must beable to safeguard ourselvesagainst the consequences of what I consider tobe an almost inevitable and catastrophic economiccollapse in America a fewyears after the end of thewar,&quot; (Minister of Air-craft Production.)&apos; In the Agreement toset up a Stabilisation Fundwe  must make   it  clear1. One of the chief purposes kept in view by the Wash-ington Delegation was to make sure that the proposals would leave us free to adopt an internal policy to preventunemployment and to stabilise our prices and money incomes, even if there were a collapse in the United States.The general settlement proposed at Washington would leave us adequate freedom and, in certain respects, wouldconsiderably improve our prospects of success in such circumstances. In the last week the United states treasury have agreed to a small change in the Preamblewhich makes the instructions to the management of theproposed Monetary Fund still more explicit on this point.The previous draft laid it down that the resources of theFund would be to give member countries time to correctmaladjustments in their balance of payments withoutresorting to measures destructive to international pros-perity. In the new text now agreed the last words run &apos;&quot; measures destructive of national or internationalprosperity.&quot; This Preamble, in conjunction with Clause 5(iii) of the Statement of Principles (see Annex A of w.P. (44) 81) should insure the purpose which the lord president has in view.2. In the event of an economic collapse in America, thebalance of payments would tend to become more favourable to the Americans, because they would reduce their purchase
beyond any possibility of future dispute that thiscountry will never again becalled upon to deflate itsdomestic income, and createunnecessary unemployment,in order to maintainrelatively stable rates ofexchange.&quot; (The lord president.)of imports and try to force their exports on the world. Itwas, therefore, particularly important to obtain provisions which might do something to mitigate such a situation.The proposals of the plan under this head are set forth insome detail in paragraphs 10 to 12 of Annex A of W.P.(44) 81.3. The Washington Delegation stated in plain terms to the American representatives that any arrangements which involved rigidity of the exchanges on the model ofthe former gold standard, or resembled the gold standardby presuming that exchange-rates should be rigid and notadapted to changing circumstances, could not be acceptedby the British Cabinet and would be inevitably rejected by Parliament. A number of clauses relating to gold andto exchange rigidity in the American draft were, therefore,either abandoned or greatly modified. The new draftexplicitly accepts the principle that the value of individualcurrencies should be changed to suit changing circum-stances. It also lays it down explicitly that the Fund isnot entitled to interfere in any way in the domestic, socialor political policies of member countries and must agreetc a change which would, in fact, restore equilibrium byother means than a change in such domestic policies. full details of the arrangements finally worked out are givenin paragraphs 13 to 15 of Annex A of W.P. (44) 81. Itwill be observed that in circumstances which a countryregards as really critical and in which it is essential for itto resume its full liberty of action, a member country canrelieve itself of all restrictive undertakings by leaving theFund, as it is entitled to do, without notice and withoutpenalty.4. The Washington proposals introduce certain novelprinciples for the adjustment of balances of payments.Countries with a seriously unfavourable balance of pay-ments are permitted, while other countries are not permitted to restrict imports; countries with balances ofpayments so favourable that their currencies become scarcemay find their goods subjected to discriminatoryrestrictions in their export markets; and there is a general principle that while exchange rates may be adjusted when this is necessary to correct a fundamental disequilibrium,they may not be so adjusted unless necessary.5. If, therefore, circumstances such as those of 1930and 1931 were to repeat themselves in addition to thenecessary freedom of action which we should retain, othercountries could not, as they did in the 1930&apos;s, retaliateunnecessarily against any action which we were bound totake : (i) Countries which were not suffering from an adverse balance of payments would be under an obligationnot to impose import restrictions against ourgoods, and the other protective devices (such as high tariffs) which are detrimental to our exports would be denied to them; and(ii) Countries would be under an obligation (even if we .had found it necessary to adjust the sterling ;exchange rate to correct a fundamental disequi-librium) &quot; not to propose a change in the parity of their currency unless they consider it appro-priate to the correction of fundamentaldisequilibrium.&quot;6. Thus much of the protectionism and competitiveexchange depreciation (such as the unnecessary deprecia-tion of the dollar in 1933 and 1934) which so largely offsetour own action last time would be ruled out. It is true, ofcourse, that the Americans like ourselves could be their
&apos;&apos; What would be theeffect on us of inflation inAmerica ? &quot; ( Minister ofLabour and National Ser-vice.)&apos;&apos; We may all agree that what the world needs is apolicy of expansion, i.e., ofmore production, and,therefore, of more goods for human consumption.But does it follow inthe least that this is likelyto be obtained merely bylower tariffs and a greatervolume of internationalexchange ? &quot; (Secretary ofState for India.)&quot;What is to be theposition in regard to theI.L.O. ?&quot; (Minister ofLabour and National Ser-vice.)own judges for the necessity of the first 10 per cent,depreciation of their currency. But for anything morethey would have to obtain the judgment of a Fund on whichthey could not have more than 20 per cent, of the votingpower, unless they were prepared to take the extreme stepof withdrawing from the monetary organisation.7. Whether inflation in America took the form of higher wages or of a demand for goods on a greater scale than the American economy can normally supply, the effect would be to turn the balance of trade against America, bothby increasing her imports and. by decreasing her com-petitive power to export, with the result of dispersing some part of her present hoards of gold. Up to a point, at anyrate, this would be greatly to the advantage of the rest ofthe world. If the flood of gold continued beyond a certainpoint, there would certainly be a risk of the inflationaryconditions spreading elsewhere through excessive inter-national monetary ease. There is nothing in the plan toprevent each member country from taking the usualmeasures to protect itself from the effects of this. But,apart from that, it would unquestionably be the duty ofthe International Monetary Fund to propose concertedmeasures for absorbing as much of the redundant gold aspossible, with a view to preventing adverse effects. Theexistence of the Fund would greatly facilitate this. Inparticular, the Fund itself could absorb a very considerable quantity of gold, the other member countries recovering acorresponding amount of that part of their subscription tothe Fund which they had originally made in their nationalcurrencies.8. Lower tariffs and a greater volume of internationalexchange might not be sufficient by themselves to ensure apolicy of expansion by individual countries. The object ofthe plan is rather to remove some at least of the obstacles in the way of individual countries wishing to promote apolicy of expansion, but unable to do so except with someoutside aid, It is not possible ^to^nlaim more for the-Washington proposals than that they tend in the right direction and facilitate the task of individual countrieswishing to adopt such policies.9. This freedom on the part of each country to undef-take effective national action against depression (in ageneral framework which will prevent such action from taking forms which are injurious to its neighbours) isprobably the most effective contribution which the Wash-ington proposals make to a policy of general economicexpansionism. But it is not the only contribution. Theproposals for Buffer Stock control of primary productsprovide a mechanism whereby extra purchasing power willbe injected into world markets at times of depression.Although only touched upon in a preliminary way duringthe Washington talks, satisfactory arrangements for thecontrol of international investment on lines which wouldstimulate activity in times of world depression will prob-ably be easier to reach, if the Washington proposals on other subjects are broadly accepted.10. Special attention was given at Washington to thepossibility of setting up an overall international economic organisation, in which the policies of the other organisa-tions (dealing with money, commodities, commercial policy,&amp;c.) could be reviewed as a whole. One of the chief, if notthe chief, purpose of this organisation would be to watch the employment implications of all the constituent items ofinternational economic policy. It is proposed that existing organisations, such as the International Labour Organisa^tion, would play an important role in this overall body.
&quot; What are the reasonsfor the departure from theoriginal conception ofbancor as an internationalunit of account, in favourof a scheme more closelytied to gold?&quot; (Ministerof Labour and NationalService.)&apos;&apos; Have you formed any sort of estimate of the gap in our balance of payments which we shall have tocover by increased exports and reduced imports afterthe war ?&apos;&apos; Secretary ofState for India.)11. The new proposals are not more closely tied to goldthan was the original conception of bancor. Indeed, thefacilities for altering the value of national currencies interms of gold are very considerably greater under theWashington proposals than was the case with the ClearingUnion. The new proposals could be redrafted with bancoras an international unit of account on the Clearing Unionmodel without in any way altering their substantial effect.The British delegates would have much preferred toexpress the proposals in this fashion, since they wouldhave been much clearer so expressed and much less liableto be misunderstood. The Statement of Principles, as drafted at present, introduces no international unit of account, neither bancor nor unitas. The reasons why theAmerican representatives prefer that and why theWashington Delegation was, on the whole, in favour ofyielding to the American point of view, are set forth indetail in paragraphs 18 to 21 of Annex A of WP. (44) 81.12. On the matter of the gold subscription theAmerican representatives, though rather reluctantly,accepted the British point of view that the obligatoryamount should be kept within modest limits. In the result the gold subscription does not play an important part inthe scheme; in our case it will work out at 10 per cent,of the reserves we hold at the date when we enter thescheme, and this is likely to be a smaller figure than theWashington Delegation were authorised by the Cabinet toput forward.13. The original American Stabilisation Fund made it possible for the managers of the Fund to take an active part in exchange dealing and to use their discretion and initiative. One of the most important matters in whichthe American representatives agreed to defer to the Britishstandpoint was concerned with this. In the final text theinitiative is reserved in normal circumstances to theCentral Banks of the member countries, the managers ofthe Fund themselves being reduced to a passive role. Thereis some discussion of this matter in paragraphs 16 and 17and 39 to 43 of Annex A of W.P. (44) 81.14. An attempt was made some months ago (R.P. (42)2, pages 10-13, and 64-76) to estimate a possible post-wargap in our balance of international payments. At thattime it wras thought that we might have to face a possibledeficiency of some  50 to  250 millions in an earlypost-war year, unless special measures were taken to correctit. But there are many great uncertainties in making anysuch estimate. For example, destruction of German and japanese productive capacity may temporarily haveimproved our export position, while the industrialisationof some of our customers will have worsened it. But weshall certainly be faced with a formidable task, and mustbe prepared to take measures to expand our export trade to,perhaps, 50 per cent, above the pre-war level.15. It is not possible to give any reliable estimate of&apos; ourpost-war balance unless we can foresee how far inter-national arrangements will permit us to take effectiveremedial action (such as limiting our imports or adjustingour exchange rate if this be necessary) without allowingother countries to take unnecessary retaliatory action. Inother words, whether our prospective deficit be  50,  100, 200 millions or even more, it is more important to be sure that we shall be free to take effective remedial action thanit is to try to estimate precisely the size of our deficit(though we must make our plans on the basic assumptionthat we shall have a large problem to overcome).16. There are certain ways in which the Washingtonproposals would limit our freedom of action.   We should
(&quot; How far would ourposition in Empire marketsbe affected by the loss or serious reduction ofexisting preferences ?&quot;(Secretary of State forIndia.)&quot; Could you give someestimate of the nationslikely to join and of theincreased exports we mightsecure in their markets,allowing for the fact thatour fellow members allcompete with us underM.F.N. terms, but that wemay in return have tariffsraised still further against us and lose M.F.N. advan-tages (for what they are worth) in markets outsidethe Union?&quot; &quot;Whatspecific countries in theEmpire are likely to be pre-pared to commit themselvesin fact, when it comes to thepoint, to the proposed com-mercial union or to the monetary union? I think can say with confidence that no Indian Legislativewould look at either.&quot;(Secretary of State forIndia.)not be able to seek special or &quot; discriminatory &quot; advan-tages in bilateral trade bargains, relying on our largemarket as a consumer to induce other countries to purchaseour goods rather than those of other countries.17. Moreover, the reduction or abolition of ImperialPreferences would contract some of our export opportunities -ties in Empire Markets (see paragraphs 23 to 26 belowfor the improved opportunities which we may expectthrough the general reduction of trade barriers). It is,however, possible to exaggerate the importance of imperial preference. Preferences are associated with other formsof trade barriers, such as high tariffs, since to reduce thelatter will require on our part some adjustment of theformer. If we compare 1929 and 1937 (both years of higheconomic activity, but separated by a period during whichthe Hawley-Smoot tariff, the Ottawa agreements and aproliferation of other barriers to international trade were introduced) we find that our export trade with the Empirehad increased only from 44-5 to 48 - 0 per cent, of our total exports, and in value had actually declined from  324 to 252 millions. Our total export trade was so reduced thatthe somewhat larger proportion which we conducted withthe Empire as a result of preferences represented a lowerabsolute value.18. As against these factors, we have to set a wholesalereduction of the barriers to our exports in other markets and the whole apparatus for the adjustment of balances ofpayments contained in the Washington proposals and discussed in paragraphs 2-6 above : the provision of aninternational credit; freedom to impose restrictions on capital exports; the adjustment of exchange-rates ifnecessary, with strict limitation on the competitiveexchange depreciation which other countries may under-take; the right to impose special restrictions against the exports of a country whose balance is so favourable that its currency has become scarce; and the right of a country generally to restrict all its imports if it has a seriousbalance of payments problem, without other countries withfavourable balances becoming free to retaliate by restricting their imports.19. In order to assess the advantages which our exports would thus gain, it is necessary to consider, first, whatcountries would be likely to join in the proposed commercialarrangements; and, secondly, what advantages we shouldgain in their markets.20. On the assumption that the United States and theUnited Kingdom both reach agreement and join theproposed organisations, countries representing a pre-ponderating proportion of world trade would probablyjoin. Thus we know that the Canadians desire to join.We can take it for granted that the &quot; Oslo &quot; group of countries (Sweden. Norway, Denmark, the netherlands and Belgium) would wish to do so. The ex-enemy countries,including Germany, Italy and Japan, could be requiredto join. The United States, the United Kingdom with theColonial Empire, Canada, the &quot; Oslo &quot; group of countries with their dependencies and the ex-enemy States aloneaccounted for 60 per cent, of world trade in 1938. Withsuch an extensiA^e &quot; low tariff &quot; club, the advantages ofwhich might be denied to outsiders, many doubtfulcountries could be induced to join. The adherence of some countries (including India and Australia) may be difficultto achieve, but it might be eased if special temporaryexceptions were allowed under - adequate safeguard for&quot; infant industries.&quot; The Indian representative at theDominions talks in July 1943 did not give the impression that, if this condition were met, Indian adherence wouldbe out of the question.
&quot;If [a commercial] 21. If, as the American and Canadian officials haveUnion did come about suggested, the tariff benefits of the commercial policyand particular Empire convention should be denied to non-members, we shouldcountries did not join, have to deny them to any Empire country which did notshould we be obliged to join. But most of our duties on Empire produce are atexclude them from the preferential rates; and it is the non-preferential ratesterms granted to other which would have to be reduced, while in some cases (inmembers of the Union1?&quot; order to narrow the preference margin) we should be(Secretary of State for obliged to raise the rates of our duties on goods from the india.) Empire.  The main problem would, therefore, be to adjustour treatment of the trade of an Empire country which did 1not participate so as to ensure that it was certainly notmore favourably, and probably less favourably, treatedthan that of participating Empire countries. If this con-contingency should arise, the matter would clearly have to bedealt with by some sort of modus vivendi.22. - It is thus apparent that, provided Anglo-american agreement can be reached, the commercial policy arrange-ments are likely to cover a very wide range of countries.The commercial policy proposals would thus bringimportant advantages to our export trades.23. A most important factor restricting our export markets before the war was the wide range of quantitative restrictions imposed on imports in foreign markets after1930. Before the war more than twenty countries,including Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands,Czechoslovakia, Poland, Italy, Persia, Japan, Turkey andthe Netherlands East Indies, had imposed restrictions.Amongst the important United Kingdom export trades which were restricted on importation into one or moreimportant countries were coal, cotton yarns and piece-goods, cotton thread, woollen yarns and piece-goods,artificial silk piece-goods, linen goods, clothing, carpets,footwear, leather, rubber manufactures, including tyres,paper and cardboard, hardware, cutlery, earthenware andpottery, chemicals, drugs, paints and colours, electricalappliances, motor cars, bicycles and various types ofmachinery. It we take a selection of countries (Bulgaria,France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Poland,Roumania, Switzerland, Turkey) which from about 1931onwards applied restrictions of wide scope to importsfrom this country, we find that between 1929 and 1937(both years of high economic activity) the value of our exports to these countries declined by 38^ per cent., whilethe value of our exports to other foreign countries fell by33 per cent. Not only was the decline in our exports tothese restricting countries very severe; it was also greaterthan the decline in our sales to other non-Empire countries,although serious barriers to our exports had been imposedor raised in other countries as well.24. Under the Washington proposals other countries will not be in a position to impose such restrictions on our exports unless they themselves are in serious balance of payment difficulties. We must on these grounds expectsome restrictions against our exports to continue. But this ^possibility should not be exaggerated. For every averse &apos;balance there must in some other country or countries be acorresponding favourable balance. If the main malad-justment of internationaal balances is an unfavourablebalance of our payments, unfavourable balances in othercountries will be exceptional. If, on the other hand, themain maladjustment is an excessively favourable balanceon the part of some large creditor&apos; such as the UnitedStates, many countries besides ourselves may haveunfavourable balances to correct; but in this case we andthe other countries with unfavourable balances of pay-ments should be able to deal with the situation by imposing
special restrictions against American goods (under thearrangements proposed for dealing with a scarce currency)without having to impose general restrictions on eachother&apos;s exports.25. In the inter-war years our exports were also greatlyimpeded by high tariffs in our overseas markets. It is asimpossible to say with any precision what increases in thevalue of our exports would have taken place as a result ofa reduction in tariffs overseas as with an abolition of import restrictions in overseas markets; but in this casealso some illustrations can be given. The formulatentatively put forward by the British officials at Wash-ington would prohibit any protective duties above a25 per cent, ad valorem level. The following table shows the ad valorem equivalent of a number of pre-war duties on some typical United Kingdom exports which wouldhave to be reduced under the proposed tariff formula to a25 per cent, ad valorem level : :Ad Valorem equivalent of certain pre-war duties inforeign market s.(f)Sanitary Earthenware.United StatesFranceGermanyEgyptGreeceJapCotton Piece-goodsg3 (Printed).34 Portugal     ...... 5945 Egypt ....... 5664 Turkey       ...... 7738 Greece        ....... 55140 Brazil        ...... 76Tinned Plate.PolandBrazil5839Wrought Iron.Greece69Internal CombustionEngines.BelgiumPolandJapan393342Weaving Looms.Poland        ...       ... 44Brazil        ...... 64Cotton Yam (Grey).Portugal     ...       ... 34Egypt       ...... 47Greece        ...      ... 49Cotton Thread.PortugalTurkeyPoland333538Cotton piece-goods (Un-bleached).Germany     ...      ... 35Egypt        ...... 59Turkey       ...... 94Poland        ...... 39Greece        ...      ... 95Brazil        ...      .... 164Worsted Yarn.United States       ... 74turkey       ...      ,.. 43Woollen Tissues.United States       ... 75Germany     ...      ... 47Portugal     ...... 60Turkey       ...... 190Greece        ...       ... 69Brazil         ...... 44Worsted Tissties.United States       ... 74Germany     ...      ... 47Portugal     ...      ... 60Turkey       ...... 130Poland        ...... 39Greece        ...       ... 61Brazil         ...... 44Artificial Silk Yarn.United StatesFranceItalyDenmarkSwedenNorwayPortugalTurkeyPolandBrazil135225359111270652107677(l) A few of these duties may include a revenue element which would not have to be reduced.

The above list contains only those pre-war duties with an ad valorem equivalent greater than 33 per cent.,and this only for a selected number of countries and a selected number of commodities. The tariff formulaproposed by our officials at Washington would not onlyimpose a 25 per cent, tariff ceiling, but would also require a reduction of all duties by at least one-quarter oftheir pre-war level with the proviso that no duty need be reduced below a 10 per cent, ad valorem floor. our exports would, therefore, enjoy many tariff reductions (inaddition to the reduction of the very high duties illustratedin the above list) for commodities and countries not included in the above list and for goods on which the dutieswere below 33 per cent, but above 10 per cent. If therewere, as there probably should be, some let-out of a tem-porary nature under suitable safeguard for &quot; infantindustries,&quot; some duties might, of course, remain for atime above the proposed 25 per cent, ad valorem ceiling.27. Another important factor in the pre-war years inimpeding our exports was the subsidies paid to her exportsby Germany on the basis of an industrial levy on her total production. We are a country in which the ratio offoreign trade to total production is often high. It is,therefore, more expensive for us to tax home production inorder to subsidise exports than it would be for a country(like the United States) in which the ratio of foreign tradeto total trade is normally small, so that a very low levy ontotal production would finance a very large subsidy on exports.28. Coal is an important commodity which we mighthave wished to assist by export subsidies. But the coalindustry is likely after the war to be faced with a scarcityrather than with a surplus of labour, so that from the pointof view of employment the need to export will not be so great. Moreover, it must not be forgotten that our overseassales will be assisted to the extent that European coalexporters (such as Poland and Germany, who before thewar heavily subsidised their coal exports) will be unablein future to pay export subsidies.29. The proposals discussed at Washington leave room for the quantitative regulation of imports and exports&quot;when necessary to implement a recognised international commodity, agreement.&quot; No discussion has taken place asto the principles on which recognition should be given tosuch an agreement except in the case of the commodity dis-cussions wrucn were not themselves intended to cover coal.But presumably similar considerations would be taken intoaccount and, in particular, whether the agreement were one
hostilities .... but ....if a large volume of coal exports is necessary toenable us to balance our foreign payments, thenspecial measures not neces-sarily compatible with theWashington recommenda-tions, may have to be con-sidered. If both export subsidies and bilateral agreements are ruled out of court, we may have to con-sider, in the case of coal,the institution of a Euro-pea n multilateral agree-ment providing for per-manent quantitative regu-lation.&quot; (Minister of fuel and Power.)which adequately protected the interests of consumers andof efficient producers.&quot; What is the minimumextent to which we shallbe compelled to cut downour imports? .... Whatdegree of tariff or of equivalent restrictions willbe needed to secure theindispensable reduction? &quot;(Secretary of State forIndia.)1&apos; So far as agriculture isconcerned, what is theindispensable degree ofprotection required to restore and permanentlymaintain agricultural pros-perity in this country ?&apos;&apos;(Secretary of State forIndia.)&quot;The proposals that haveemerged from the Washing-ton discussions appear to preclude the possibility ofany satisfactory and prac-ticable plans to give effectto the Governments pledgeabout long-term agricul-tural policy.&quot; (Minister-of Agriculture.)30. Our exports should gain considerable, advantagesfrom the clearances of the channels of trade which are contemplated. At the same time, if we had a seriouslyunfavourable balance of payments we should be free to restrict our imports quantitatively. Because of thegeneral uncertainties (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above), itis not possible to say whether in the long run any suchrestriction will be necessary, or if so, on what scale. but whatever scale of restriction should prove to be necessary,we should be permitted to impose. The prospect for a country with an unfavourable balance of payments, of relatively unrestricted export markets and of the right tocontrol imports is one which we should be unwise lightly to dismiss.31. The Washington proposals (covering as they do&quot; action directed towards the reduction of tariffs and othertrade barriers &quot;) naturally restrict our freedom to protectparticular industries and occupations in this country. Butcare has been taken to leave sufficient elbow-room forreasonable protective policies, while outlawing the more extreme forms of protectionism. The amount of freedomwhich has been left may well be examined by seeing how theWashington proposals would affect our agricultural policy.32. High tariffs would have to be reduced and thiswould involve the reduction of some high duties on horticulture-:cultural crops. A more moderate level of protective duties,,the basis of which has still to be agreed, could be imposed on any agricultural imports. Room Would thus be left forlevy subsidy arrangements, whereby a levy (not exceeding the permitted tariff level) was imposed on imports, the proceeds of which were used to subsidise home production.If, however, in order to pay any given guaranteed price tohonie producers the levy proved insufficient, the rest of thesubsidy would have to be met through a direct charge onthe Exchequer.* 33. Quantitative import restrictions Avould be per-mitted during the immediate post-war years, and could thus be used as a means of controlling the post-warreadjustment of agriculture. They could be used as partof an international commodity scheme;; and, although itis our desire to avoid restrictive&apos;commodity agreements,such arrangements are likely to be inevitable in some caseswhere serious world surpluses exist :   and in these cases
&quot;It is not altogetherclear whether the proposals that have emerged from theWashington discussions would preclude us fromadopting a system underwhich imports of stapleagricultural commoditieswere the monopoly ofthe Ministry of Food.&quot;(Minister of Agriculture.). &apos;&apos; We must exclude anyclause or phrase suggesting that this&apos; country is boundto abandon or modify thepractices of bulk purchase and State purchase that ithas adopted during thewar.&quot; (The Lord Presi-dent.)&apos;&apos; Freedom to negotiatelong-term bulk contracts both purchase and sale by economic organs of theState is to my mind a vitalinterest of this country.&quot;(Minister of Aircraft Pro-duction.)our agriculture will need this means of protecting itsallotted share of world production. They will be permitted as a means of controlling a seriously adverse balance of payments; this exceptional use could not formthe basis of a long-term agricultural policy; but times of world depression are times when our balance of payments is most likely to be seriously adverse and when our agricul-agriculture is most likely to be in need of protection fromexcessively low prices, so that this exception may incideh-tally prove to be of importance to agriculture.34. Our officials at Washington opposed the use of ^quantitative import restrictions for the purpose of pro-tecting domestic production control schemes, and in doing so met with the full support of the officials of the Depart-ment of State They did so because the alternative was toallow free use of quantitative restrictions against imports in overseas markets an obstacle which the inter-war years had proved to be the most serious for our exports. In this they were following the Cabinet instructions which hadbeen given to them in the following terms : &quot; that the quantitative regulation of imports should not ordinarilybe employed for the primary purpose of protecting homeindustries.&quot;35. Stability in international agricultural prices will be promoted in so far as we are successful with the proposalsfor the international regulation of primary products (par-ticularly by Buffer Stock arrangements), which were thesubject of the commodity discussions at Washington.36. Apart from this, stability of domestic prices can. if desired, be guaranteed at any level to our home producersby the payment of subsidies (or by levy-subsidy arrange-ments), provided that a satisfactory solution can be found of the difference of opinion which was discovered between our officials and the American officials on the subject of subsidies. A possible compromise on this subject whichwould leave us with the ultimate right of decision as tothe scale on which we should subsidise home agriculture issuggested in paragraph 17 (iii) of Annex B of w.P. (44)81.37. The Washington proposals would not prevent us from adopting a system under which imports of stapleagricultural commodities were the monopoly of theMinistry of Food. There was full agreement with theAmerican officials that any commercial policy arrange-ments would have to make room not only for a country likeRussia, where the whole of foreign trade was monopolisedby the State, but also for a country which wished to run an economy of State enterprise for certain things mixed with private enterprise for others. Although the Americansthemselves much prefer private enterprise, there is nothing in the proposals discussed with them that could precludeus from carrying on. or indeed extending, any schemes ofState trading which we might desire.38. We should therefore be free to arrange long-termState bulk contracts either for the purchase of our imports .or for the sale of our exports if we so desired. We could /use this instrument to introduce an additional element of stability into our agricultural or markets. There would,however, be general rules against using this instrument for discriminatory purposes or for giving greater protec-tion than that permitted under the other rules of thecommercial convention. These rules would not be simpleto apply and experience would be required in workingthem out. All that is immediately contemplated is theacceptance of certain principles for national behaviour;and complaints by aggrieved States might be ventilatedbefore an appropriate international body.
&apos;&apos; What should be ourown position in relationto State Trading?&quot;(Minister of Labour and national Service.)&apos;*.... it will be im-possible to deal satisfac-satisfactorily with the situation inthis country if imports arenot quantitatively con-trolled either by regulationor by State purchase. Theuse of one of these twomethods is essential for thepurpose of securing theeconomic stability of home agriculture. .... my own preference is for Statepurchase through ImportBoards or a Ministry ofFood.&quot; (Secretary of Statefor Scotland.)&quot; How in fact is it goingto be decided, if Russiajoins the Union, that her exports are not subsidisedor that she freely admitsimports subject to a tariffor buys them through herState agencies whenever they are x per cent,cheaper than home produc-tion ? Will the commercial union have its agents inEussia to investigateRussian productive costs ?&apos;&apos;(Secretary of State forIndia.)&apos;&apos; What safeguards are there for the maintenanceof adequate labour stand-ards and conditions ofemploymen t V&apos; (Ministerof Labour and NationalService.)39. The rules against non-discrimination would preventthe use of State-trading organisations for the promotion of strictly bilateral deals on the lines that such-and-such a country should take its goods from us (regardless of theterms on which our competitors could supply them),provided that we bought their goods in return (regardless of the terms on which others would be willing to supplyus). But they would not preclude long-term contractsdesigned to give stability to our imports or to our exports,provided that we did not offer substantially more favour-able terms (whether in prices or in other conditions) to onesource of supply or to one purchaser than we were willingto offer to other sources of supply or to other purchasers.40. It would not be permissible to use the instrument of State-trading merely as a means of reintroducing levels of protection which had been ruled out by the other clauses of the commercial convention. In general, this would mean that we could not use a State importing monopoly to raisethe price of the imported commodity to the consumer abovethe price at which we purchased it from the foreigner bymore than the permitted tariff margin. Any additionalprice advantage offered, for example, to the home producer of agricultural products would have to be by way of subsidy..41. The problem of enforcing the principle of non-discrimination would be no more (and no less) difficult inthe case of a country which, like Russia, monopolised thewhole of its trade than in the case of a country which, likethe United Kingdom, may wish to monopolise its trade incertain products. In both cases complaint might be lodgedwith the proposed international commercial policy organi-sation to the effect that substantially less favourable termshad been offered by the State-trading organisation to theaggrieved country than to some third party; but in no case is it contemplated that the agents of the international body should be stationed in the member countries in order to police the convention.42. The enforcement of the rules against providingexcessive protection or against paying export subsidies bymeans of State trading monopolies would be more difficult in the case of a country which, like Russia, monopolisedthe whole of its internal and external trade than in thecase of a country which, like the United Kingdom, is likelyto have a considerable element of private enterprise in itsinternal economy; for in the former case comparisonsbetween external and internal prices may lose theirmeaning. Before the war Russia accounted for only about1 per cent, of world trade, so that commercially the problem is not of the first importance. The Washington proposalssuggest that a country which monopolises the whole of itstrade might be asked to commit itself to purchasing goods to not less than a certain, specified value as its contributionto the expansion of world, trade. This commitment to makespecified global purchases might take the place of the commitment which other countries would undertake, not togive greater protection through their State tradingorganisations than was permitted under the tariff rules ofthe commercial convention.43. The Washington proposals would do nothing toprevent the International Labour Organisation from con-tinuing and developing its work for the improvement oflabour standards and conditions. Any action that was contemplated by the International Labour organisation for the enforcement of agreed conditions could be allowed for by the proposed commercial policy organisation.44. It is important, however, that any action should beinternational in character. Otherwise we might be as open
&quot;If and when theproposals discussed atWashington become public,will not there be so muchcontroversy and uncer-tainty as to hamperseriously the rehabilitationand development of our industries in the transition period?&quot; (Ministry ofAgriculture.)&quot;Is it in any case clearthat in the 4 or 5 yearsafter the war, i.e,, in theperiod before it is contem-plated that the proposalsdiscussed at Washingtoncould come into operation,to the imposition of. special restrictions by the Americansagainst our goods on the grounds that our labour standardsare lower than theirs, as the Japanese wroulcl be to theimposition of special restrictions by us on their goods.A new proliferation of restrictions might thus result.     -45. It is, moreover, questionable whether we reallystand to gain by imposing restrictions on cheap supplies(whether their cheapness be due to low wages as in japan or to high efficiency as in the United States). Wecan undoubtedly gain by refusing admission for cheapforeign supplies into the colonial territories which wecontrol; but in this case our producers gain at the cost of refusing cheap supplies to the colonial natives. In so faras we refuse admittance to cheap foreign supplies in theUnited Kingdom market itself, we are denying ourselvesthe advantages of obtaining certain goods more cheaply inreturn for the export of goods in the production of whichwe have relative cost advantages.40. If the flood of cheap supplies became so great thatour balance of payments became seriously adverse (i.e., ifwe could not in fact pay for them by exporting the goods inwhich we had a cost advantage), we should be permitted to exclude imports on balance of payments grounds.47. The problem of cheap Japanese production becameacute during the 1930&apos;s, that is to say, during years ofgeneral economic depression and contraction of world markets. If a general policy of economic expansionismhad been successfully adopted in the major markets during that period, the problem would have been much moremanageable. The Washington proposals are designed toset the stage for a policy of general economic expansionism.This, combined, (i) with the right which each country willhave to restrict imports, if supplies of cheap goods reachsuch dimensions as seriously to affect its balance ofpayments, and (ii) with any remedial action which theInternational Labour Organisation may take, should affordmeans of meeting this problem.48. In those industries which work largely for export markets or like shipping, depend upon world trade, the clearance of the channels of world trade which is contem-plated will remove much uncertainty that might otherwise have impeded their development. In most lines of produc-tion for civiliansupplies and suchexternal) that it is most improbable that production will be seriously checked. It is also expected that the demands for capital equipment (to make good war damage andarrears of repairs, renewals and extensions) will be soextensive during the transitional period that it will benecessary strictly to limit demands on our capital resources.There is, therefore, little danger of a general deficiency of demand leading to general trade inactivity, even if therewere some hesitations in certain lines.49. If it were desired to give a long-term element ofprotection on which any particular industry (e.g., agri-culture) could rely, this could be done by the imposition of tariffs up to the permitted level and/or by the payment of subsidies. It could not be done by holding out the pros-pect of continued quantitative restrictions on imports.50. The Washington talks concentrated primarily on long-run objectives; and, if the arguments of the preceding paragraphs are correct, in this respect they meet our vital interests. At the same time it was made clear by our officials (and it was accepted by the American officials) that special exceptional arrangements would be necessaryduring the transitional period.    Special reference wasgoods there will be such shortages ofnfb excess of demand (both internal and
we should be perfectly free to pursue any policies we might find necessary, e.g.,about regulation of im-ports, in the interests of theexchanges or of the restora-tion and development ofindustries and the pro-vision of employment ?&apos;&apos;(Minister of Agriculture.)accordingly made in the joint Anglo-American report on commercial Policy to the need for the quantitative regula-tion of imports during this period.51. As the discussions now approach nearer to the stagewhen decisions will have to be reached on actual commit-ments, it becomes increasingly important for us to make sure in rather more detail that the precise arrangementscontemplated for the transitional period both in monetary policy and in commercial policy satisfactorily meet theneeds of our difficult situation. For this reason in myfull report to the Cabinet I include more detailedsuggestions about the way in which our needs for the transitional period may be covered in the proposedmonetary and commercial arrangements.
