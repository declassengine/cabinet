THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC JMAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (44) 51.24th January, 1944.WAR CABINET.PUBLICITY CONCERNING JAPANESE TREATMENT OF british prisoners OE WAR AND CIVILIAN INTERNEES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues will recall that on the 27th October last they invited theMinister of State, in consultation with the other Ministers concerned, to arrangefor the United States Government, the Netherlands Government, the dominions governments and the Government of India to be consulted in regard to thesuggestion that a campaign of publicity should be started with a view to forcingthe Japanese to remedy the treatment accorded by them to our prisoners of war(War Cabinet Conclusions 147 (43)).2. The Governments concerned were duly approached, but it proved difficultto secure unanimity of view. The Governments of the Netherlands, New Zealand,South Africa and India substantially accepted our proposals, the canadian government expressed a desire to consider the matter further, but the UnitedStates and Australian Governments were unwilling to agree.3. I was about to submit to my colleagues a suggestion that a renewedeffort should be made to overcome the reluctance of the United States Govern-ment in particular when, on the 22nd January, I received from Lord Halifaxthe unexpected information that President Roosevelt had lifted the ban on thepublication of atrocity stories and that an official statement would be issued bythe Office of War Information on the 24th January. Steps were at once takento urge upon the United States authorities the desirability of a! few days&apos; delay in order that our plans might be co-ordinated with theirs, with the result thatthe President has authorised the Office of War Information to delay action untilthe 31st January unless accounts of Japanese atrocities which are already inthe hands of the American press are published before that, in which case theOffice of War Information must issue the official version.4. As it will be necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to make a state-ment about the Japanese treatment of British prisoners and internees at aboutthe same time that the American statement appears, I have had a draft prepared,the text of which is attached as an Annex. I hope that my colleagues will concur in its terms.5. I am taking steps to inform the United States Government that I should wish to make this statement in Parliament either on the afternoon of Friday,the 28th January, or of Tuesday, the 1st February, and that I hope that their statement will be issued on the same date. I am suggesting that, if there is stilla danger of premature publication by the American press, the earlier date maybe preferable.A. E.Foreign Office, 24th January, 1944.12260   [26785]
Draft Parliamentary Question and Answer.Question. To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he can makea statement regarding the treatment of British prisoners of war and civilian internees in the Far East.Answer^ Yes, Sir. I fear I have grave news to give to the House. members will be aware that a large number of post-cards and letters have recently beenreceived in this country from prisoners in the Far East: and that these almostuniformly suggest that the writers are being treated well and are in good health.The uniformity is so striking as to leave no doubt that all these communications are in terms dictated by the Japanese authorities. I regret to have to tell theHouse that information which has been reaching His Majesty&apos;s Government nolonger leaves room for any doubt that the true state of affairs is a very differentone so far as the very great majority of prisoners in Japanese hands is concerned.The House is already aware that a very high proportion, perhaps 80 to90 per cent., of the prisoners and civilian internees in Japanese hands are located in the Southern area, comprising the Philippine Islands, the Netherlands east indies, the island of Borneo. Malaya, Burma, Siam, and Indo-China, and thatthe Japanese Government have hitherto withheld permission for any neutralinspection of any of the camps in question. We have not even been allowed toknow the numbers of prisoners detained in the various areas nor have the names of a large number of those who must have been taken prisoner by the Japanese,yet been communicated to us.For some time past, information has been reaching His Majesty&apos;s government regarding the conditions under which prisoners are detained and worked insome of these areas, and as it was of so grave a character as to be likely to causedistress to relatives of prisoners and civilian internees in Japanese hands HisMajesty&apos;s Government felt bound to satisfy themselves that it was authenticbefore making it public. His Majesty&apos;s Government are now so satisfied, andit becomes my painful duty to tell the House that in Siam there are many thousands of prisoners from the British Commonwealth, including India, whoare being compelled by the Japanese military to live in tropical jungle conditionswithout adequate shelter, clothing, food, or medical attention : and these menare forced to work on building a railway and making roads. Our information is that their health is rapidly deteriorating, that a high percentage are seriouslyill, and that there have been some thousands of deaths. Here may I add thatthe number of such deaths reported by the Japanese to us is just over 100. Therailway and roads concerned lead into Burma and the conditions I have describedapply throughout their whole length.One eyewitness reports of a camp in Siam that &quot; I saw many prisonersclearly. They were skin and bone, unshaven and with long matted hair. Theywere half-naked.&quot; The same witness reported that they wore no hats or shoes :and this, may I remind the House, in a tropical climate, where the neighbouring-country is virtually uninhabited, so that there are practically no local resources which could provide medical or other material relief.Of one other part of this huge Southern area we have some information.From Java comes evidence which leaves no doubt that many prisoners are confinedin camps with no adequate protection from malarial infection and lacking in proper provision for sanitation : except in so far as prisoners may sometimesobtain food from local sources, the food and clothing provided is insufficient tomaintain them in health. Reports from the Northern area have referred to theemaciated state of prisoners arriving from Java,I have so far no information to give the House regarding conditions in otherparts of the Southern area.Before I leave the Southern area, I ought to make one exception to what Ihave said. There are civilians interned in our old military camp at Changi andin the neighbourhood of Bangkok and Saigon, and our information suggests that conditions in those particular camps are at least tolerable.The refusal of the Japanese Government to permit neutral inspections ofcamps in the Southern area is difficult to understand, in view of the fact that theyhave allowed visits by neutral inspectors (though on a scale which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment cannot regard as adequate) to camps in the Northern area whichcomprises Hong Kong, Formosa, Shanghai, Korea and Japan itself.His Majesty&apos;s Government are reasonably satisfied that conditions generally inthis area are tolerable, though as my Right Honourable friend, the Secretary ofState for War, has told the House on more than one occasion, the scale on which
food is provided is not adequate over long periods to maintain the health ofprisoners. I should add, however, that conditions in Hong Kong appear to be growing worse.If that were the whole of the story it would be bad indeed; but there is worseto come. We have a growing list of cases of brutal outrage on individuals or groups of individuals.I will give the House two cases affecting civilians. The first is that of anofficer in the Shanghai Municipal Police Force. Along with some three hundredother Allied nationals, he was interned by the Japanese in the Haiphong RoadCamp in Shanghai, which, unlike most civilian internment camps in the far east, is run by the Japanese gendarmerie; it is really a detention camp for so-called &quot; political suspects.&quot; He incurred the displeasure of the Japanesegendarmerie and was taken away to their office in another part of the town.What exactly happened there we shall probably never know, but his conditionwhen he emerged from the building was such that he never recovered from it. Itappeared that the Japanese had, among other things, tied him up in such aposition that he was unable to move a muscle and that he was left like this forsome days. He was practically out of his mind; his arms and feet were infectedwhere ropes had left deep scars; and he had lost 40 lbs. of weight. He diedwithin a day or two after his release from the gendarmerie office.The second case comes from the Philippine Islands. Here, on the11th February, 1942, three British subjects escaped from the Japanese civilianinternment camp at Santo Tomas, Manila. They were recaptured and floggedby the camp guard. Two days later, on the 14th February, they were sentenced to death by a military court, despite the fact that international law prescribesthe imposition of only disciplinary punishment for attempts to escape. The firingparty used automatic pistols, and the three men were not killed outright. Fourseparate volleys were fired, four or five minutes elapsing between each volley.Even in their grave the men were still moaning and groaning, bat the Japaneseofficer in charge ordered the Philippine grave-diggers, on pain of death, to fillit in.I now turn to cases affecting soldiers. A number of Indian soldiers captured in Burma, having had their hands tied behind their backs, were made to sit ingroups by the side of the road. They were then systematically bayoneted frombehind in turn, each man receiving apparently three bayonet thrusts. By somemiracle, one man who collapsed subsequently recovered and escaped to our lines.The other case concerns an officer of a well-known regiment of the line, whodescribed his experience in Burma as follows : &apos;&apos; An officer then came along andlooked at me in a brutal sort of way. . The next thing I knew was that I waskicked in the face with his foot and clubbed across the face four times with hissword. My face was too numb to feel much pain. I was next tied to a stakewith my hands and feet tied so tightly that no blood could get through to them.Then a rope was passed round my neck, and, unable to breathe, I was about toenter another world when I found that by raising my body I could just get enoughair to keep me alive. I lay like this for over an hour neither living nor dead.By then my neck had swollen, and with the perspiration and tightness of the ropeI was in agony. I shouted at them to put a bullet or a bayonet into me and bedone with it. All I got for my pains was a kick in the face. They were allsitting round enjoying the fun. I had a moustache then and they lit a match and set fire to it. Actually, that was the least painful of all that they did to me.They took a wire revolver cleaning brush and started to rub my neck with it.They stuck into me lighted cigarette ends and lighted sticks from the fires theywere cooking rice on. But all this was mere child&apos;s play to the strangling painof the rope around my neck, only just loose enough to allow the minimum of airsufficient to keep me alive. At intervals they would cut the air off completely bytightening the rope for about 30 seconds, when I would all but &apos; kick the bucket.&apos;Fortunately, an Allied attack developed at this point; the Japanese fled and theofficer was rescued by a British tank.The third case concerns a transport called the Lisbon Marti which was being used to convey over 1,800 British prisoners of war from Hong Kong. conditions on board were almost indescribable. The prisoners were so seriously overcrowdedthat they lay touching one another. Many of them were under-nourished andmany had contracted diphtheria, dysentery and other diseases. There was nomedical provision; practically no washing facilities existed; the sanitaryarrangements were virtually non-existent. Two of the prisoners in one holddied where they lay and no attempt was made to remove their bodies. On the morning of the 1st October, 1942, the vessel was torpedoed by a United Nations
submarine. The Japanese officers, soldiers and crew kept the prisoners underhatches and abandoned ship forthwith, although she did not sink until 24 hourslater. There were insufficient life belts and other safety appliances on board.Some of the prisoners managed to break out and swim to land. They were firedon when in the water.   In all, at least 800 prisoners lost their lives.I have said sufficient to show the barbarous nature of our: Japanese enemy andthat he has violated not only the principles of International Law but all canons ofdecent and civilised conduct. His Majesty&apos;s Government have repeatedly madethe strongest possible representations to the Japanese Government through the swiss Government. Such replies as have been received have been evasive, cynicalor otherwise unsatisfactory. His Majesty&apos;s Government had the right to expect that, once aware of the facts, the Japanese Government would remedy this state of affairs. The Japanese know well what are the obligations of acivilised Power to safeguard the life and health of prisoners who have falleninto their hands. This was shown by their treatment of prisoners in the Russo-Japanese war and the war of 1914 to 1918. Let the Japanese Government reflectthat in time to come the record of their military authorities in this war will notbe forgotten.It is with the deepest regret that I have been obliged to make such a statement to the House. But after consultation with their Allies who are equally victims ofthis unspeakable savagery, His Majesty&apos;s Government have felt it to be their duty to make public the facts.
