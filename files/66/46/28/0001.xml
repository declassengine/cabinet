NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. Two convoys have arrived in North Russian ports. U-boat attacks werebeaten off by the escorts of the second convoy with the loss of one destroyer.Two U-boats have been sunk, three probably sunk and one possibly sunk.One of H.M. cruisers has been sunk off Anzio.Northern Waters.2. Early on the 30th, when a convoy proceeding to North Russian ports wassouth of Bear Island, H.M.S. Hardy, one of the escorting destroyers,&apos; was torpedoed and sunk. Captain (D) and all other officers were rescued, but40 ratings were lost. Five or six U-boats were operating in the vicinity, but allattacks were beaten off by the escorts. The 16 ships comprising the convoy subse-quently reached port.The preceding convoy, originally consisting of 15 ships, has arrived in NorthRussian ports with the loss of the three ships which were reported sunk in lastweek&apos;s Resume. k3. ELM. S/M Stubborn, while on patrol off the Norwegian coast, torpedoeda 2,500-ton ship on the 26th north of Trondheim.Home Waters.4. On the night of the 29th/30th a Sperrbrecher, which had sailed from dunkirk to the westward under escort, was attacked by coastal forces andAlbacores and shelled by coastal batteries. One of the escorting minesweepersand twoR-boats were damaged.  Three M.T:Bs. sustained some damage.On &quot;the following night three groups of E-boats attacked a coastal convoyS.E. of Beachy Head. H.M. destroyers Quorn and Albrighton drove off two ofthe groups during an action which lasted nearly two hours. One of H.M.trawlers escorting the convoy was torpedoed and subsequently sank.On the night of the 31st/1st M.T.Bs. made contact with and carried out anattack on a medium-sized ship steering northward from Boulogne with ten escorts.Mediterranean.5. The weather in the Anzio area has been generally good throughout theweek and unloading has continued satisfactorily. H.M.S. Dido and, later,H.M.S. Penelope (cruisers) provided fire support for the left flank of the army.On the 26th, shipping was twice attacked by torpedo, glider-bomb anddive-bomber aircraft:&apos; the U.S. destroyer Ludlow was damaged by a near missand several landing craft were also damaged. On the 29th, H.M.S. Spartan(cruiser) was hit by a glider bomb and subsequently sank : the captain, 31 other officers and 496 ratings were rescued.H.M. cruisers and destroyers and the Dutch gunboat Soemba have continuedto bombard the Formia area. On the 27th in the course of one bombardmentrH.M. ships Mauritius (cruiser) and Kempenfelt (destroyer) silenced a battery,broke up road movements and cut a train in half.Coastal forces, on the night of the 31st/1st, sank an enemy patrol craft by gunfire off Spezia.6. In the Adriatic, or -fob night of the 29th/30th, M.G.B. 662 andM.T.B. 97 sank a small Ge:^ ..xn. tanker and a large schooner off the Yugo-Slavcoast west of Split. On the night of the 31st/1st M.T.Bs. sank two smallschooners off Silba Island (south of Fiume). On the following night destroyers bombarded positions near Ancona.7. H.M. submarines have reported the following : Unsparing, while on patrol in the northern ^aegean, sank two caiques, probably sank another and damaged two by gunfire in Port platinum, Lemnos, on the 15th. Upstart, while on patrol off the south coast of France, shelled seaplane bases near Cannes and near St. Raphael on the 23rd and 27th. Untiring, patrolling in the same area,torpedoed two westbound ships of 7,000 and 3,500 tons off Toulon and twoeastbound coasters of 500 tons on the 30th and 31st:
Pacific.Marshall Islands.8; U.S. warships have carried out bombardments to support and coverlandings on the Islands (see Military Situation).New Guinea.9. The U.S. cruisers Boise and Phoenix with 3 destroyers bombarded theAlexishafen-Madang area on the 28th and started several fires.Anti-Submarine Operations.10. Thirty-three attacks have been reported, of which 22 were made by ships and 11 by shore-based aircraft. One of the attacks was carried out in theMediterranean.&apos; A Sunderland sank a U-boat 150 miles west of Ireland (R) onthe 28th and H.M. ships Starling and Wild Goose (sloops) sank another some300 miles S.W. of Ireland (R) two days later. A Wellington probably sank aU-boat in the Bay of Biscay on the 29th. So far as is known at present, the escortsof the convoy to North Russia which was intercepted south of Bear Islandprobably sank two U-boats on the 30th. H.M.S. Hardy, while escorting theearlier convoy, possibly sank a U-boat on the night of the 25th/26th.11. During January 109 attacks on U-boats were reported, of which 44 weremade by shore-based aircraft, -four by carrier-borne aircraft and the rest by warships. It is estimated that five U-boats were sunk, nine probably sunk, twopossibly sunk, two probably damaged and five possibly damaged, all of themGerman.12. During 1943 it is estimated that 217 German U-boats were sunk orprobably sunk by the Allies. Of these 115 were caused by shore-based, 25 bycarrier-borne, aircraft, eleven by the joint efforts of aircraft and warships, sevenby submarines, 55 by warships and four by other causes.Enemy Intelligence.13. In addition to the Tirpitz, there were reported to be on he 1st inKaafjord five destroyers, the large anti-aircraft ships Nymphe and Thetis, theliner Monte Rosa (13,882 tons, used to accommodate the workmen employed onrepairing the Tirpitz), a. repair ship, a floating power plant and a tanker.U-boats.14. In Northern Waters a group of 12 or 14 U-boats has been operating in the Bear Island area, on the route of the two- convoys to North Russia.In the Atlantic the main dispositions appear to be unchanged. There hasbeen evidence of co-operation between U-boats and reconnaissance aircraft close to the western approaches to the North Channel.In the Indian Ocean there are probably four German U-boats in the northern part of the area and one S.E. of Mauritius.Enemy Attack on Shipping.15.   One ship was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat in the Gulf of Aden.      ;Two ships were sunk in an attack by E-boats On a coastal convoy off BeachvHead.A US. ship was torpedoed and sunk and another was slightly damaged&apos;ni ah attack on an eastbound convoy N.E. of Or an by 40 aircraft, three of whichwere shot down. One ship was sunk during air attacks off Anzio and one was damaged by fire during an air raid in London Docks.16. In the four calendar years from 1940 onwards, the effect of new construction upon losses of ships of 1,600 tons and over was a net decrease in 1940of 3,181,000 tons, in 1941 of 2,423,000 tons, in 1942 of 1,000.000 tons and a net increase in 1943 of 11,141,000 tons.; 17. It is estimated.that at the end of 1943 there was a total of 44,950,000tons of ocean-going shipping available to the United Nations, among which15,550,000 tons were British and 21,250,000 tons were owned by the United States.,.[26848] b
Protection of Seaborne Trade.18. During the week ending the 30th, 806 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these, 277 were in ocean convoys and 529 in British coastal convoys. Fifty-nine destroyers,, including 18 U.S. destroyers, and 97 sloops,cutters, corvettes and frigates were employed on escort duties. Four homeward-bound ocean convoys, consisting of 119 ships, and five outward-bound convoys,consisting of 159 ships, arrived at their destinations.   Three ships were lost.19. During 1943, six convoys consisting of 105 ships arrived in NorthRussian ports. Sixty-four of these ships were loaded in the United Kingdomand 41 in the United States. Their cargoes included 12,945 vehicles, 1,293 tanks,868 aircraft, 72,853 tons of fuel and 44,255 of spirit and 441,590 deadweighttons of miscellaneous cargoes. Numbers of guns, cranes, locomotives, railway wagons, &amp;c, details of which are not available, were shipped in addition. Noships were lost in the outward-bound convoys but six ships were lost on home-ward passage.Allied Minelaying.20. Surface craft laid mines off the north coast of France. Aircraft laidmines in the Baltic and in the Heligoland Bight, off the Frisian Islands andthe Biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.21. E-boats are suspected of minelaying on one night of the week, off the humber. For the fifth week in succession there have been no reports of mine-laying by aircraft.Seven mines have been been destroyed, all off the East Coast.The mine totals are 4,642 ground and 4,145 moored.Spanish Intelligence.22. During the second half of 1943, ten Spanish ships homeward boundfrom the Argentine were taken into Gibraltar for examination. strategic materials, enemy correspondence, microfilms and two enemy agents were found on board. &apos;No Spanish ships are to be accepted in Allied convoys.The Spanish motor-ship Mayo was seized on the 27th in Gibraltar on admiralty instructions.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign. (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern Sector. ;23. The Russians have continued to drive the Germans back westwards andsouth-westwards, forcing the River Luga at a number of points on the 31st january and capturing Kingisepp the following day. At one point they are now within one mile, of the Estonian frontier. They have completely freed the railwayLeningrad-Moscow, and have thrust westwards from the Novgorod area, cuttingthe railway Leningrad-Dno and approaching within seven miles of Luga. TheGermans still hold a deep salient almost to Chudovo, but it seems unlikely thatthey will continue to hold this for long.West of Velikie Luki the Russians captured Novo Sokolniki on the 29th.Central Sector. ,.24. The Germans have reported heavy fighting between the Beresina andthe Pripet, but these reports may well be exaggerated.Kiev Sector.25. In the Shepetovka area German pressure forced the Russians to give some ground, but the Russians themselves have now been attacking for some days and have regained some of the ground lost.
East of Vinnitsa and North of Khristinovka the Germans forced the russians to give some ground and claim to have inflicted heavy casualties in the course ofa week&apos;s fighting, but their progress has been slow and there are signs that their attacks may be petering out.Since the:-28th-the- Russians have been attacking on both sides of theBoguslav-Smela pocket and have made some penetrations into the Germanpositions. A German news agency report has admitted the evacuation of Smela,but this has not been officially confirmed by the Germans nor claimed by theRussians. The probability is that the situation in this area is still in a state offlux.Dnieper Bend.26. There is ho confirmation of German reports of Russian attacks N.W.of Kirovograd, S.W. of Dnyepropetrovsk and at the Nikopol bridgehead.Crimea.27. Russian attacks at Kerch have been held in the main, but a number of points of penetration are causing the Germans some anxiety.General.28. The Russians&apos; offensive in the northern sector has now brought their troops to within a few miles of the River Narva, and they are likely soon to come up against the defensive system which the Germans are believed to have prepared in this area. While there are few signs of any voluntary German withdrawal,any further Russian progress west of Novgorod would be a serious threat to allthe German forces east of Lake Peipus.On the Kiev front the Germans have had some success in pushing the Russiansback from the railway Lwow-Zhmerinka-Odessa.The Russians, however, may be preparing to return to the offensive here, as&apos;they have already done in the Boguslav-Smela area.Italy.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)29. The fight for the Cassino position, and the steadily growing resistance to our advance from the Anzio-Nettuno bridgehead, have been the two.principalcentres of interest on the Italian front during the past week.30. U.S. forces who after their initial failure had renewed their attempts to force a crossing of the Rapido north of Cassino succeeded in their task on the25th January, although the enemy resistance which met them brought them almostto a standstill later the same day. They were helped by some spirited diversionarydemonstrations carried out by another U.S. formation, which had the desiredeffect of drawing the enemy&apos;s fire throughout the night of the 24th/25th&apos;. Therefollowed several days of fighting, when the U.S. troops met with fierce resistance,but by the 30th they had succeeded in moving 23 tanks across the river, and onthe 31st they reached their first positive objective, which was the village of Cairo,2^ miles N.N.W. of Cassino. By the 2nd February they had still further envelopedCassino by continued pressure in a south-westerly direction.Meanwhile, immediately to the north, French troops were fighting one oftheir hardest battles since their entry into the line. Their northerly objective was a height south of the Cardito-Afeina road, and here the struggle resolveditself into one of alternate loss and gain, while to the south another FrenchDivision on the 25th January began an attack aimed at cutting the Cassino-Atinaroad. Against both these thrusts the enemy showed the keenest reaction, but theFrench, for the most part, withstood the many counter-attacks, and by the 30th thesouthern offensive, supported by elements of a U.S. division, succeeded in gainingand consolidating positions south of.the village of Belmonte. From here the jointfo rces were directed on to Mount Cairo, which lies three miles to the north-west ofthe village of the same name, captured by U.S. forces the previous day. Strongcounter thrusts by the enemy from the Belmonte area that followed this advancewere dispelled by the French,- who have now pushed forward to within 1^ miles to the east of Mount Cairo. The Allied intention to outflank Cassino from thenorth will have been achieved if Mount Cairo can be secured[26848]        . b 2
31. Although no definite counter-attack has been made by the enemy in theAnzio-Nettuno bridgehead, the resistance with which our advancing troops havehad to contend is a clear indication of the enemy&apos;s intention to block our advance towards the Albaii hills. US. forces directed on Cisterna have, at the time ofwriting, been held up within 1,000 to 2,000 yards of their objective in spite of hard fighting. The British have Captured Campoleone railway station and arepatrolling vigorously forward of their present positions,, but their advancedtroops are in a dangerously narrow salient. US. armoured forces have supported the British advance on Campoleone by an attack which has made some gains north of the village of Corroceto, but everywhere resistance is stiff, and our advance isattended with extremely heavy fighting. The Germans are still in some strengthsouth of the railway between the British and U.S. forces.A brighter picture is found in the satisfactory rate of build-up over thelast week. Despite the unfavourable contours of the beaches, the efforts of theLuftwaffe, and the delay caused by two days poor weather, the build-up remainedalways up to schedule.Units of the Allied navies have continued to give support to land operations,and air activity has also been intense in support of land operations and over our shipping off the Nettuno-Anzio coast.32. The news from the other parts of the Italian front is of repeated and determined enemy counter-attacks against British gains on the lower reaches ofthe Garigliano, all of which have been successfully withstood. In face of theintense enemy reaction along the Garigliano, particularly at Castelforte and around Minturno, very little gain has been possible, and our forces have spentmost of the period under review in regrouping.In the Eighth Army sector activity has been confined to patrol clashes andthe extremely bad weather continues seriously to hamper movement.In general the enemy has recently shown himself rather more alert along the whole front, and his patrol activity has been on an increased scale.Yugoslavia.33. In East, Bosnia the Partisans have withdrawn from Tuzla after heavy fighting. The Partisans have captured two towns east of Sarajevo, while another of their forces is attacking southwards from Vlasenica (40 miles N.E. ofSarajevo). .In West Bosnia fighting has died down.Partisan attacks oi a German formation moving south from Karlovac inCroatia have slowed up the enemy advance.Greece.Civil War.34. In spite of an arrangement between Zervas and E.L.A.S. to suspendhostilities from the 25th January E.L.A.S. attacked Zervas on the following dayforcing him to withdraw along his whole front.E.L.A.S. forces have been strongly reinforced and their offensive has beencarried out with great intensity. For these reasons the British Liaison Officerwith Zervas considered that E.L.A.S. attack was a deliberate attempt to crushZervas.Burma.35. West of the Mayu Range Japanese counter-attacks have continued but without success. On both sides of the range our troops have advanced in the face of heavy opposition, tanks being employed in the capture of several hill featureseast of Maungdaw.In the Chin Hills, our troops have successfully attacked Japanesepositions west of Falam, and have beaten off three night attacks in the area&quot;ofNualbem (14 miles south, of Tiddim). Japanese casualties are believed to havebeen heavy.Chinese troops have continued their advance down the Hukawng Valleyagainst a determined opposition, and have now reached points 22 miles south ofShingbwiyang.
New Guinea.36. In the coastal sector Australian troops have reached a point 17 miles west of Sio.In the Ramu Valley Australian troops advancing down the Mintjim Valleyare now overlooking the main road running northwards to Bogadjim.New Britain.37. U.S. Marines advancing south-eastwards from Cape Gloucester have captured Natamo on the southern shore of Borgen Bay.At Arawe, U.S. patrols have cleared an area 5,000 yards eastwards fromtheir main perimeter.   The landing ground at Arawe is now free of Japanese.Marshall Islands.38. On the 31st January, U.S. troops landed on the north and south ofKwajalein Atoll and have established beachheads in the face of Japaneseresistance.AIR SITUATION.General Review.39. Bomber Command despatched strong forces to Berlin on three nights.By day, Frankfurt and Brunswick were attacked by escorted bombers of the eighth U.S. Air Force.In Italy, air support was provided for our land and sea forces; heavy attacks were made on enemy railway centres and airfields.Aircraft based on the Gilbert Islands and naval aircraft attacked Japanesepositions prior to the naval operations against the Marshall Islands. There was increased activity in other Pacific sectors.United Kingdom.40. On the night 29th/30th January, about 100 long-range bombers were reported overland, of which 15 to 25 penetrated to Greater London. No effectiveconcentration was achieved. Five enemy aircraft were destroyed, of which fourwere shot down by A.A. fire.On the night 28th/29th, a small-scale raid was carried out by 15 Me. 410and a similar number of F.W. 190 fighter-bombers.Home Waters.41. Beaufighters of Coastal Command sank a minesweeper, set a 5,000-ton ship on fire and damaged an escort vessel in convoy off the Norwegian coast.Typhoon bombers destroyed a 1,200-ton ship and several barges at Bromvershaven,Holland.Sea-mining in enemy waters w7as carried out by 168 aircraft of bomber command; 567 mines were laid.Germany and Occupied Territory.42. Early in the week, an intensive offensive was maintained both in daylight and at night against targets in Germany. Within a little over 60 hours6,540 tons of bombs were released on Berlin, Frankfurt and Brunswick and, after a pause of one night, a further 1,803 tons were dropped on Berlin. unfavourable weather then intervened.Bay.43. Aircraft of the Eighth U.S. Air Force made heavy attacks onFrankfurt and Brunswick.Frankfurt, an important inland port and rail centre, with big chemical,aircraft propeller and tyre plants, was the target on the 29th for the largest number of U.S. bombers yet despatched on a single mission. They were escortedto and from the city by long-range fighters and withdrawal support was provided
by R.A.F. Spitfires, and Typhoons; a total of 1,608 sorties was flown on this operation, in which 1,672 tons of bombs were dropped, with good results by803 Fortresses and Liberators.On the following day, a similar number of aircraft was involved, when 699bombers dropped 1,447 tons at Brunswick, where industrial targets include air-component factories and engine works. This operation, for which fighter coverwas also provided throughout, involved a round flight of over 800 miles. Therewas heavy cloud over Brunswuck and the effect of the attack could not visuallybe assessed. Hanover was bombed by 39 Liberators; 104 tons of bombs were released.Casualties on.these two days are reported provisionally as follows: 196 enemy aircraft destroyed, 54 probably destroyed and 92 damaged for the loss of49 bombers and 19 fighters.Military objectives in Northern France were bombed by 200 Liberators and170 medium, light and fighter-bombers; a total of 720 tons was dropped.Thunderbolt bombers effectively raided Gilze Rijen airfield and Maraudersbombed the airfield at Tricqueville.The following successes in air fighting were achieved without loss. On the27th, four Mosquitoes and two Typhoons destroyed ten enemy aircraft overCentral France and Belgium and, on the 30th, 13 Typhoons shot down 12 enemy fighters and destroyed two on the ground.Night.44.&apos; Bomber Command sent 1,759 bombers to Berlin. Of this total, 439aircraft attacked the Reich capital on the 27th/28th, 543 on the night following(preceded five hours previously by a light raid by Mosquitoes) and 456 on the30th/31st. A total of 5,220 tons of bombs was dropped during these threeoperations which&quot;, in each instance, were carried out through cloud. The majorityof the crews bombed on the accurately-placed sky-marker-flares and, though,visual observation was impossible, intense concentrations are believed to havebeen achieved. One hundred and nine bombers did not return and nine crashed;some crews from the latter baled out safely. Seven enemy fighters are known tohave been shot down.Smaller raids, involving 132 sorties, were carried out by Mosquitoes; targetsincluded Berlin, Duisburg, Aachen, Krefeld, Hanover, Brunswick, Elberfeld,Dutch airfields and military objectives in Northern France.Four enemy aircraft were shot down by &quot; Intruders,&quot; one of which is missing.Italy.45. Air support and cover for Allied land forces was provided by fighters and fighter bombers wdiich flew a total of 6,548 sorties over the battle fronts and inthe rear of the enemy&apos;s positions. Roads and railways south-east of Rome were almost continuously patrolled and railway tracks, roads, road junctions and focalpoints were effectively bombed; other fighter-bombers operated well to the north of Rome. Successful attacks were made on M.T. and rolling stock and at least152 vehicles were destroyed and a further 192 and 9 locomotives were damaged.Close support was provided for our troops, particularly to the north of Cassino, andgun emplacements and enemy defences were attacked.The main enemy fighter and fighter-bomber effort was directed against theNettuno bridgehead area, concentrating mainly on shipping and port installations;the scale of effort varied between 50 and, 100 sorties a day. Anti-shipping forces operating from Southern France and long-range bombers from Northern italy were also employed. Operations by the long-range bomber force were exclusivelyunder cover of darkness, glider and torpedo bomber attacks being carried out atdusk or dawn, frequently with considerable loss; the effectiveness of these opera-tions has been small. A total of 55 enemy aircraft were destroyed in thisbattleEnemy railway centres were subjected to a heavy scale of attack. the marshalling yards at Verona were bombed by 76 Fortresses and. a smaller forceof Liberators attacked Ferrara; Arezzo was bombed at night by Wellingtonswith excellent results. Other centres effectively attacked were term , Orte,Foligno, Ancona, Rimini, Fabriano, Siena, Bologna and San Beneditto.At Orvieto, the centre span of the North Bridge was destroyed in an attack by 50 Marauders and a train which was crossing the bridge was blown off and
wrecked. Hits were obtained on the railway bridge at Orte and the line to Terniwas cut. Bridges were also destroyed or hit at Borghetto (18 miles W.N.W. ofPerugia), Marsciano (18 miles N..E&apos;. of Orvieto), and&quot;Civita Castellana (27 miles .N.W. of Rome). The roads east, and west of Velletri were bombed and 71Bostons attacked Frosinone town.Considerable destruction was caused by escorted heavy bombers to airfields in Northern Italy. Villaorba (N.N.W. of Venice) was twice attacked by a totalof 143 Fortresses, after which the centre of the airfield was covered with cratersand appeared to be rendered unserviceable. Udine was also attacked twice by asimilar force; 15 minutes before the first attack was made, 60 Thunderbolts flew over the area with the object of intercepting enemy fighters or other aircraftleaving before the airfield was bombed, and claimed to have shot down 46 enemy aircraft, including 11 Ju. 52. Other attacks by heavy bombers were made onManiago airfield (W.N.W. of Udine) and Aviano (N.E. of Venice). In the courseof these operations, many hangars, administrative buildings and billets were hit,and 74 aircraft on the ground were destroyed or damaged. Enemy opposition wasfairly strong and in.combat 56 enemy aircraft were shot down excluding thosereported destroyed by Thunderbolts. Allied losses were seven bombers and threefighters.The total sorties flown during the week by the Mediterranean Allied AirForces was 9,650. Battle casualties were 163 enemy aircraft destroyed for the lossof 45 Allied aircraft.South France,46. Successful raids by a total of 164 heavy bombers were made on enemybases from which anti-shipping units were operating. The airfields attackedwere Montpelier, Salon and Istres Le Tube. The bombing was very accurate and extensive damage was caused to hangars, workshops, administrative buildings,living quarters and parked aircraft. Some enemy fighters were encountered, 21 ofwhich were shot down, and three Allied bombers and two fighters are missing.Austria.47. On the 31st January, 70 Fortresses escorted by Lightnings attacked the airfield at Klagenfurt. One T &quot; hangar received three hits, two other hangarswere damaged, 42 barrack huts were destroyed and 18 aircraft on the ground were destroyed or damaged.Yugoslavia and Albania.48. In coastal waters, Italian M.C. 205 set on fire a vessel of 160 feet and damaged a ferry boat and a schooner. Spitfires left a schooner sinking, damaged a launch and attacked a radar station north of Durazzo.Greece and iEgean.49. Beaufighters and Mitchells made frequent attacks on shippingattempting to supply enemy-occupied islands. Thirty caiques, two landingbarges, two escort vessels and one coastal vessel of 500 tons were sunk or seriously damaged. In addition, a ship of 3,000 tons was left on fire and one of 2,000 tonsand another of 160 feet were hit.       ...Four Beaufighters on an offensive patrol encountered three Ju. 52 and threeArado 196; five of these were destroyed and the sixth was probably destroyed.Russia.50. Air activity was severely restricted over the whole front by continuingbad weather, with the exception of a short-lived improvement at the beginningof the week:The communiques have little to report this week but there is no doubt thatclose support operations were carried, out whenever possible, particularly on thenorthern part of the front between Leningrad and Lake Ilmen, and in the south,east of Vinnitsa. -.There was also considerable air activity over the Crimea, where the russian air Force afforded strong support for ground forces on the landing bridgeheads.
The day-by-day claims for the week of German aircraft shot down by fighter and A.A. defences over the whole front amounted to 258 aircraft.Burma.51. A total of 789 offensive sorties, including 274 by bombers, was flownduring the week ended 1st February. Enemy positions, encampments, troop concentrations and transport were bombed at Fort White, Buthidaung,Maungdaw and Akyab. Enemy communications, including railway centres atRangoon and Mandalay, were targets for other operations. Shipping on theMayu river and off the Arakan coast was attacked; three Large rivercraf t, about 70smaller craft and 19 loaded sampans were damaged or destroyed.Enemy activity was negligible. .China.. 52. On the 25bh, Mitchells, operating off the China coast, sank a mine-Hweeper, a tanker, a patrol boat and three small freighters. Kittyhawks bombed the airfields at Kengtung on the 25th and Loiwing on the 30th.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.53. Between the 25th and 31st January, targets in the Madang andAlexishafen areas were effectively bombed by a total of 104 Mitchells with fighter escort; two bridges and several barges were destroyed along the coast fromBogia to Cape Groisilles (22 miles N: of Madang). Bostons demolished a building,near Madang, believed to be a Japanese H.Q., also two bridges at Alexishafen.Vengeances made four hits on Gori River bridge (Bogadjim) and two squadrons of Mitchells bombed Nubia airfield (190 miles N.W. of Lae).In support of our land forces,. Kittyhawks attacked enemy positions in theUpper Ramu valley and Bostons dropped bombs on an occupied village in theSio area (45 miles N. of Finschhafen). -New Britain.54. During the five days ended the 30th January, the airfields at Lakunai,Tobera and Vunakanau, all near Rabaul, were attacked each day and, on two occasions, at night. Fifty-six Liberators, 146 naval aircraft and 45 medium bombers operated. About 42 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground andphotographic reconnaissance on the 29th disclosed that the runways at Lakunaiand Tobera had been rendered unserviceable. Most, of the formations were heavily protected by fighters, 16 of which did not return; the destruction isreported of 121 intercepting aircraft in combat.Liberators also bombed the supply area on the N.E. shore of Simpson&apos;sHarbour (Rabaul). Bostons, in support of our troops, attacked enemy positions in the South Borgen Bay area and near Itne River (S.W. coast). &apos;Off Rabaul, naval aircraft sank a 5,000-ton freighter and set fire to a destroyer and two cargo ships of 10,000 and 5,000 tons respectively. At HansaBay, Mitchells sank four small vessels and a number of barges. Single Catalinasand Liberators attacked a southbound convoy between Kavieng and Rabaul; an,000 tonner and two other ships were left burning.Marshall Islands.55. Between the 24th and 29th January, escorted heavy, medium and navalbombers dropped 76 tons of bombs at Mili, Wotje and Taroa.
