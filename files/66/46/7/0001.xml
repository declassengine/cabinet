THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 57.27th January, 1944.INDIA,    &apos;INDIAN STATES : PROBLEM OF PETTY STATES IN WESTERN INDIA.Memorandum by Secretary of State for India.I AM obliged to trouble my colleagues with an urgent problem, serious initself and in its possible consequences, which has arisen from an attempt toimprove administrative arrangements among the hundreds of petty States in western India and for which I am advised that the only prompt and efficacioussolution lies in immediate legislation. &quot;   .2. The background is as follows. Early last century with the downfall ofMahratta power, British influence in the west of India was extended toKathiawar and Gujarat and relations Were entered into not only with Barodaand a small number of other States of some importance but also with a largenumber (somejlOO) of very petty chieftains. These latter were not absorbed into british India. The British authorities assumed responsibility for the collectionof the tribute due from them to Baroda and took securities for their good behaviour. No guarantee of independence was given them but their estates haveever since been treated as independent units. . Their total population is some800,000; individually they are all small (some 40 of them are a square mile or lessin area) with very scanty resources. It was impossible to leave these chieftains to administer law and order by themselves, and the British authorities assumed theexercise of civil and. criminal jurisdiction in their territories, in some casescompletely, in others leaving minor powers to the chieftain (usually styled the&quot; taluqdar &quot; &quot;or &quot;estate-holder&quot;). But British intervention did not go beyondthe sphere of &quot; police &quot; administration; the British authorities could not or didnot, provide adequate funds and machinery for supplying the services com-munications, educational, health, &amp;c. to which the population in the neighbouring territories of British India, or of the larger States have become increasingly accustomed, partly no doubt because the units were scattered and formed enclaves in territory not under British jurisdiction.3. This state of affairs has been felt more and more to be highly unsatis-factory and a reproach to the discharge of the Paramount Power&apos;s responsibilitytowards the States and their peoples. For^years-past the problem has been carefully studied in the search for a remedy which, while taking due account ofthe long-standing rights and dignities of the taluqdars, would admit the popula-tion of these States or Estates to a share in the benefits of modern administration.Schemes of &apos;&apos; confederation &quot; or of absorption into British India were examined and dismissed as impracticable or impolitic. The solution of most promise, whichwas adopted last year, was to &quot;attach &quot; the petty States to Baroda or to othersamong the larger adjoining States with which they had particular affinity ongeographical, family or political grounds. The &quot; attaching &quot; State was permitted to assume the exercise of those jurisdictional powers hitherto exercised in the petty State by the Crown Representative&apos;s officers, and was required, to give an assurance that the benefits of its administration would be open to thepopulation of the attached State, while the taluqdar is left, for the present atleast, in possession of his previous dignities and of such minor powers as hepreviously exercised. It was made clear that the Crown Representative admitteda continuing responsibility, which did not exclude his future intervention as[26792]Copy No.WAR CABINET.
circumstances might require, to all the parties, with a view to securing theprogress and development of the areas concerned, and that the scheme would, besubject to further review after seven years.4. Last August a notification was issued by the Crown Representativeterminating the jurisdiction previously exercised over the attached States bythe Courts established by the Crown Representative and transferring outstandingcases to the Courts of the appropriate &quot;attaching State. One of the affectedtaluqdars, failing in consequence of this notification to get a hearing before a lower court, appealed to the highest local court, that of the Judicial Commissioner,who ruled that the notification was invalid since the Crown Representative, in applying the attachment scheme, had overstepped, his powers as defined in the proviso to Section 2 (1) of the Government of India Act (  &quot; Provided that any powers connected with the exercise of the functions of the Crown in its relationswith Indian States shall in India, if not exercised by His Majesty, be exercisedonly by, or by persons acting under the authority of, His Majesty&apos;s Representativefor the exercise of those functions of the Crown&quot;) and also in paragraph 4 ofthe Crown Representative^ Letters Patent (  &quot;Further, Our Representativemay empower authorities in India subordinate to him to exercise such of his powers and discharge such duties as he may from time to time deem fit.&quot;). Inthe Judicial Commissioner^ view of the transaction the Crown Representative had.transferred or delegated certain of his powers for exercise by the officials of theattaching State, who were certainly not under his authority or subordinate to him.5.   The proviso to Section 2 (1) was, of course, not enacted to cover, such acase, but to meet the fears of the Princes that with the extension of responsible government in India the exercise of paramountcy in their States might come under the control of British Indian Ministers.   I understand that the LawOfficers, with whom the whole matter has been discussed, regard the judgment asquestionable in law and unlikely to survive examination on appeal.   There is, infact, no Jaw circumscribing the competence of the Paramount Power to attach oneState to another, as it has done in Kathiawar, and it is to be noted that thepowers which the attaching -States have been permitted to assume are powershitherto exercised by the Crown as of right, and not powers which were everrecognised to be exercisable by the attached States.   The Law Officers, I under-stand, accept this statement of the position.   The bare fact is that when theBritish came on the scene early last century, a state more or less of anarchyprevailed in Kathiawar, and the ancestors of the present Taluqdars each wieldeda fluctuating and limited authority in his immediate neighbourhood.   matters were crystallised by the British settlement, which resulted in our conceding to eachchieftain a limited degree of sovereignty, but with no claim to the powers of jurisdiction subsequently exercised by the Crown and now relinquished by theCrown to be assumed with the approval of the Paramount Power by the attachingStates.   There is no need to rely for justification of the policy which has beenadopted on the absence of any formal treaty with the Crown recognising the rights which the Taluqdars of these petty States have been permitted to enjoy.   Theselimited rights, which are to remain with the Taluqdars, rest on long standingpolitical practice.   Usage and sufferance, to which I referred in replying to aquestion about the Treaty rights in the House on the 3rd December, 1942, has inthe process of time operated to create such rights as well as to modify those basedon ancient treaties.6. Whether or not the Judgments cited were good in law, the matter ofregularising the position which they have created has become of very realurgency. The scheme introduced last April was on the whole acquiesced inat the time by the Taluqdars concerned, but it was admittedly not universallypopular, and the Courts&apos; judgments have had the effect of greatly increasingresistance to the inception of the new arrangements. In certain quarters thereis even reported to be a steady drift in the direction of open defiance, and aserious breach of the peace is not impossible. I attach as Annexure II a recenttelegram from the Crown Representative which shows how the situation is rapidly deteriorating. It is essential, therefore, to overrule the effect of thesejudgments at the earliest possible moment. A manifest failure of the crown representative to enforce his orders in this matter would have most unfortunaterepercussions on his relations with the Indian States generally.7. Three main solutions offer themselves. One is to withdraw the wholeattachment scheme. I regard this as out of the question. The crown representative and I are both fully committed to it.   I am convinced that a
drastic measure is essential to clear up the utterly anomalous and out-datedstate of affairs in Kath.iaw.ar and Gujarat, and I know of no more practicalarrangement that can in present circumstances be applied for the benefit of theinhabitants of these petty Estates while leaving their Taluqdars in possessionof their rights and I would emphasise that that is the whole object of theattachment scheme. A second course is to carry the matter to the Privy Council.I am fortified by the views of the Law Officers in thinking this course would be successful; but, unfortunately, it would entail long delay and an immediatesolution is essential. . The third course is to ask Parliament to pronounce thatthe Crown Representative has, and has always had, the power to do what hashere been done, and that there is nothing in the Government of India Act, orany other Act, to prevent this. I attach as Annexure I a provisional draft of a bill as an indication of what I have in mind. For this course, and for facilities for theearliest possible passage of the Bill, I now, with the concurrence of the LawOfficers, solicit the approval of the Cabinet.L. S.

ANNEXURE II.Telegram from Crown Representative to Secretary of State, dated2Qth January.193 P.   My telegram 155 P, dated 19th January : Attachment scheme.2.   Situation in Kathiawar and Gujarat resulting from Bhadwa Talukadecision is quickly deteriorating.   Briefly, position is now as follows : 1Baroda. Three of second stage States have refused to accept Instrument ofAttachment and large number of Talukdars have questioned validity ofattachment.Bhavnagar. Withdrawal of State officials from some estates demanded and legal action threatened if Darbar continues to exercise jurisdiction. Applicationfor action under Section 107, Code of Criminal Procedure, already filed in AgencyCourt by a Talukdar against State police officers who entered attached area.Limbdi. All Talukdars except one threatened legal action against Stateofficials functioning in their territories and decided to ignore communication from minor administration. In some estates they have instructed their peoplenot to comply with State orders and local courts and police have been established.Dhrangadhra, Gondal, Idar and Junagadh. Communication from Darbarto a number of units attached to both first and second stage refused or ignored.3. In Sitapur, where attached units are prepared to resist by force intrusionof administration of attaching States, where Agency administration has been withdrawn, and where some attached units are trying to fill this void by settingup new administration of their own, chaos must shortly ensue and clashes willbe inevitable in spite of the patience so far exercised by attaching States and the paramount Power, whose authority is thus challenged. Situation is aggravated by the&quot; attitude of Judicial Commissioner, who, according to Resident, has instructed, or proposes to instruct, Agency Courts to proceed with pending casesfrom attached units despite withdrawal from Thana areas of His excellency the Crown Representative^ officials and the absence of Agency for execution of court&apos;s orders. Economic difficulties have also arisen owing to refusal of manyunits to obtain through attaching States controlled commodities essential fortheir people.4. In view of the grave danger in allowing the present situation to continueany longer, I feel I must press for legislation at the earliest possible date to restore the position.
