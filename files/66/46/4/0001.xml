I now attach (Annex I), for the information of the Committee, an interim report on the subject, which includes a special section on coal. Thisreport has been drawn up in consultation with officials of the Ministry of Labour,Ministry of War Transport and Ministry of Fuel and Power.2. As the report itself indicates, a great many of the figures given, both ofthe increased tonnage which will have to be carried, and more particularly of possible savings in traffic, are necessarily tentative. This, therefore, is no morethan an interim report designed to show the broad dimensions of the problem.It will be; followed.as soon, as possible by a further note in which, with theco-operation of the other Departments concerned, I hope it will be possible tomake specific and detailed recommendations.The present report does, however, show beyond doubt that there is already a serious problem.3. In the meantime I ask my colleagues to note that action is being concentrated upon a number of remedies which are recommended in the report.They are : :(i) A quicker turn-round of wagons (paragraph 5). This question affectsnot only railway operating labour, but also the labour of industrialfirms and merchants who load and unload wagons at destination. v(ii) The provision Of additional labour urgently required by the transport system (paragraph 6).

ANNEX I.INLAND TRANSPORT.Introduction.1. Following the decision of the War Cabinet on the 17th January, 1944, a preliminary survey has been made. This has been done in consultation with theMinistry of Labour, the Ministry of War Transport and the Ministry of Fuel and power. This Memorandum gives the result of that survey as a suggested basis for Ministerial consideration of the problem.In the course of it we have indicated, what remedial measures are now in handand, secondly, what further measures we suggest for consideration.Scope of the Survey.2. .The survey covers all inland transport (including coastwise shipping)during the first half of 1944.Measurement of the Need.3. Until the effects of operation are felt, the Minister of War Transportconsiders that it should be possible to carry additional tonnage of coal as thenecessary operating labour is provided and if severe weather conditions are notencountered. In this period, however, it is essential to clear the ports and. linesof congestion in preparation for the operation; and essential to ensure that theimprovement in coal traffic is sufficient to avoid the dangers foreseen in para-graph 15.When coasters have to be withdrawn for operations, the Ministry of war transport estimate the displacement of traffic previously carried coastwise andother factors mentioned below will involve increased demands, for a peak periodof some three months, upon the railways, road transport and canals, comparedwith November, 1943, as below : Monthly Increases Tons per month.Coal formerly carried by coastwise shipping required for- .operations (over and above 250,000 tons which can beprovided by putting deep-sea ships on coastwise routes)      800,000Other merchandise, formerly coastwise      ...       ... ... 600,000Additional operational traffic.......      ...      ... ... 750,000Additional &quot; Bolero&quot; traffic ....      ...      ...       ... .... 150,000II per cent. Allowance for unforeseen contingencies ... 400,000Total  ... 2,700,000Additional coal to be carried owing to the planned rise in deep-mined and\h open-cast production starts now at 400,000 tons per month and will increase\\ substantially (see the end of paragraph 15).Note. The greater part of the increases will have to be carried by the&apos;railways which in November carried about 25,000,000 tons.Tonnage alone is not, however, the best measure to take and as far aspracticable it is planned in the future to relate it to wagon loadings.(vii) Traffic savings resulting from recent production cuts should be ascer-tained and put into effect at the earliest possible date (paragraph 13).Lastly, the Departments concerned, in collaboration with the Ministry ofInformation, should be invited to draw up the outline of a National publicity campaign on the lines recommended in the report, and to suggest the practical measures to be taken to launch it.O. L.Great George Street, S.W. 1,2Qth January, 1944. .
How is the Need to be met?4,   All remedial measures fall into one or other of two groups-(a) increase in capacity, .(b) reduction of traffic.Specific proposals are made and so far as possible evaluated in the succeedingparagraphs.Wagon Turn Round.5. Under (a) apart from the provision of the necessary operating labour themost important relief measure is to reduce wagon turn round and thereby increasewagon loading. The present average time of turn round is nine days (thegreater part of which is, however, on the lines rather than at the terminals).Statistically, a reduction of one day in. the average would make 100,000 additionalwagons available with a carrying capacity of an additional 9 per cent, of traffic,equivalent to say 2,000,000 tons per month. This would enable weekly wagonloadings to be increased by from 880,000 to 950,000-960,000 per week. but these calculations ignore the factors of line and terminal capacity. The trafficneeding to be carried is largely concentrated on certain main lines involving longhauls, and the Ministry of War Transport do not consider that the maximumcapacity of the railways in the spring or summer is likely to exceed 940,000wagons forwarded a week, and.substantially less than this during the first quarterof the year. We do not underrate the difficulties, but nevertheless we feel thehigher figure should be our target objective. A campaign has been. launchedTSachieTe&quot;qui&quot;cker turn round, but every &quot;conceivable stimulus must be given; it may even be necessary to consider whether some statutory sanction is desirable.To secure this objective it will not be enough to.supply the necessary labour to increase the railway operating staff. It is necessary to ensure that delays in loading and unloading should not occur when these operations are performed by persons despatching or receiving goods. It should form one of the main points in the national campaign (see paragraph 17) to emphasise the necessityfor this loading and unloading to be done, without delay, even at the expenseof utilising for the purpose labour which is ordinarily otherwise engaged, incases &quot;where sufficient additional labour for the purpose cannot be rapidlyobtained. The persons responsible for loading and unloading should endeavourto secure that they haid adequate labour for the purpose and where this isrequired every effort should be made to supply the labour needs. The Ministryof Labour view is that it might be found that much of the labour required couldbe obtained, for the time being, from the factories concerned and that additional labour should only be supplied when it is clear that such factory labour is notavailable.Operating Labour for Transport.6. The Ministry of War Transport have stated that in order to operate at maximum capacity their need for increased labour in the next six months will be 29,300 after providing 22,000 wastage. This is 9,000 more than theallocation approved by the Cabinet for the first half of the year. The 29,300is divided as followsRailways   ...      .........      16,400Road ... -    ......      ...        4,000 (all drivers)Docks        ...       ...      ....      ...        8,900 (all men)In the present critical situation we recommend these figures be accepted.It must, however, be emphasised that the supply of 9,000 additional workers overand above the numbers allocated will of necessity mean that some other formof product or some other service must go short and it will be necessary to provide that this result be accepted. &apos;&quot; &apos;   V &apos;It is agreed by all concerned that the first step must be to endeavour to obtain ?the labour required through the regional preference machinery, but wherever thisis not successful first preference will have to be given.   It is therefore proposedthat the following be added to the designated list: &quot; Transport work of special \importance in selected areas as agreed from time to time between the Ministry %of Labour and the Ministry of Production.&quot;   &apos;Additional Loading af Wagons. -.7. Apart from overloading, a less important but not entirely negligiblemeasure to increase the carrying&apos;capacity of the railways is the raising of thesides of. the wagons, and particularly mineral wagons, so that they can carry the[26788]       . , ^!;:;: b 2
the full load. This can only be done with.certain types of wagOn without serious risk of breakdown. Steps have already been taken to &quot; lipplank &quot; some 15,000wagons as they come in for repair.       r ,:,! .Road Increase in Carrying Capacity.   &apos;: :    &apos; :8. (a) Provision of additional drivers will be very difficult, but to the extent that the Ministry of War Transport can&apos;make the transport available, every effort should be made to find the drivers.      !        ,      . &apos;&quot; &apos;&apos;(b) Temporary assistance by using service vehicles, British and American,especially on their own traffic, should be secured wherever possible.ic) The possibility of using C &quot; licence vehicles in general haulage work is being investigated. These vehicles would include not only vehicles which havebeen laid up and can be brought into Use, but also vehicles which could be released for this purpose by the firms now operating them through a re-arrangement ofwork involving a larger fuel ration for those that are retained on the firm&apos;s ownwork.(d) The Ministry of War Transport consider that there are not a largenumber of laid-up vehicles which could usefully be brought into service. Mostof those which are usable belong to &quot; C &quot; licence operators and particulars havealready been obtained. The. 4,000 drivers are required partly for bringing thesevehicles into use, partly to man such additional new vehicles as can be obtained,but largely to provide relief and shunt drivers to increase the use of existingvehicles.Canals. .9. Little scope appears to exist for increasing the tonnage carried by canalsin the immediate future. It is doubtful whether any such increase could beobtained with an economy of labour compared with other means of transport, butcare should be taken to ensure the use of canals to the maximum possible extent.Reduction of the Volume of Traffvc.10.   The following paragraphs 11-13, indicate measures of reducing traffic which seem to merit consideration.*Use of Stocks. - .. ,11. All departments, including the -Service Departments, should be instructed to re-examine their stock position with a view to making use of a proportion of this to maintain the output of end products while reducing theircall on transport for primary and intermediate products. The timing and methodof applying such action will need careful consideration.Cuts in Traffic.12. A main contribution that we suggest towards reduction of traffic is a cut in steel traffics. Some investigation has already been made by the Ministry ofSupply, and a first estimate is that by making the maximum calk on(a) consumers of stocks of steel,(b) stocks of raw materials at iron and steel works,(c) stocks of imported steel,and by making corresponding reductions in 1 production, a saving of 450,000-500,000 tons of transport a month would be made for a period of about threemonths without appreciably affecting the consumption of steel.    &apos;Any further reduction of tariffs, and therefore of production of steel; would&apos;involve a reduction in the use of steel by consumers. It would be necessary toknow beforehand what consumers and for what classes of steel the reduction couldbe made. In the meantime investigation is being made to see where&apos; production could be further reduced (probably by completely closing, some steel works) withthe least harmful effect in essential supplies and the greatest relief to transport13. The Ministry of Wat Transport have already had preliminary discussions with most Departments about the economy of transportation that theymight be able to effect. Apart from the saving given in paragraph 12 above, theMinistry of Supply have tentatively indicated possible savings in shipment of timber from Scotland to England and of fertilisers. The extent of these is being investigated, but (if suitable arrangements for the use of different ports forphosphate rock can be made) they&apos; may amount to some 150,000-200,000 tons amonth.  The War Office, on the basis of revised export programme, hope to save
135,000 tons per month,, In addition, the Air Ministry and the Ministry of aircraft Production have been asked whether they could effect a saving,principally on materials used on airfield construction, of 500,000 tons per month.Apart from the foregoing savings, which should not at this stage beconsidered as firm, there will be the savings due to recent programme cuts on thebasis of maximum effort in 1944. , Estimates of the effects of these on second quarter transport requirements have been asked for from Departments. when these are received it should be possible to recommend what further action, suchas additional cuts in production, or even cuts in imports, may be necessary.With estimated savings as indicated above together with savings from the&apos;recent production programme cuts, we should have gone a long way to achieve a statistical balance, if the best expectations on the railways are realised, with theimportant exception that no allowance has been made for the movement of increased opencast and deep-mined coal. If we do not improve on the Novembercoal loadingSyStocks will be dangerously low 1st May, 1944 (paragraph 15 (1)).Additional Measures.14. While everything should be. done to secure these savings they cannot all be realised immediately and for this reason as well as to relieve the coal situation,we must therefore examine further possibilities. The following are suggestions that we believe are worth pursuing : (i) Examine possibility of further temporarily reducing exports of military stores and movements of troops to overseas theatres. We appreciate thedesirability of making maximum use of available shipping, but every ship&apos;s cargoinvolves considerable inland transport movement. Military stocks in theMediterranean and in India are considerable, and though there must be manystores in short supply in overseas theatres, over a large part of the field the authorised &apos;&apos; strategic &apos;&apos; reserves plus the &apos;&apos; pipe-line &apos;&apos; have been filled and atemporary drawing upon these reserves is to put them to the use for which theywere intended.(2) An enquiry into the possibilities of reducing passenger trains (includingreference to Easter and other holiday traffic). Such reduction may be of specialvalue in certain areas where lines are crowded. Ask Service Departments toconsider reduction, if not temporary cancellation, of all but compassionate leave and also restrictions of movement of troops by rail to the minimum.(3) Reduce so far as possible shipment by rail of boxed vehicles. Considerthe increased use of Tank Transporters and large lorries to assist in dealingwith such of this traffic as must continue. There is an accumulation at thepresent time which calls for special clearance measures. To ensure that emptyvehicles being assembled go away fully loaded...(4) Consideration of the arrangements for the procurement of lodging-allowances and/or Hostels with canteen facilities, so that &quot; through working &quot;of the men could be extended or re-introduced where possible.    This would increase flexibility and economy of staff.   We think it is a valuable suggestion - and should be referred to the R.E.C.All possible measures of increasing the flexibility in the use of railway staff should be considered. With regard to transfers of staff, some improve-ment in flexibility would be secured if transfers between Companies werepermissible. Finally, in a number of places the use of women could be very.much increased. There is a great variation between the various Depots in theextent to which dilution by women has been put into practice.(5) Reduce sugar refining for a time because stocks are good.   This is being discussed with Ministry of Food.Coal. &apos;\&apos;^v&apos;:&quot;:u, VJJ1&apos;&apos;-1;15. The coal situation is so critical and is such an important part of the!whole problem that we found it convenient to deal with the various aspects ofthe coal transport problem: in a separate section of this Survey. ;(1) The Ministry, of Fuel and Power estimate that, if the. monthly carry-&apos;ings of coal during the remainder of the Coal year (30th April, 1944) are notgreater than they: were in November 1943, by that time stocks in industrialconsumers5 hands will have run down to an average of slightly under seven days and public utilities will be in an extremely difficult position. If this provesto be the case &quot;on the average &apos;&apos; it is certain that some undertakings willhave been shut down for lack of coal by that time.  aMoreover, in the critical
summer months, when operational traffic is at its peak, it will be impossible without further remedial measures to raise the level of stocks to anything likethe necessary Autumn level, and in that event the position next winter would be disastrous. &apos; ,(2) The Ministry of Fuel and Power also maintain that a continuance ofthe November experience of coal transport is not an unduly pessimisticassumption because the November carryings were higher than December. Thereis still the possibility of interruption of traffic from hard weather.(3) They further point out that if transport is not increased above this level, some coal production will be lost, the political consequences with regards toballotees, &amp;c, will be embarrassing, and opencast production will have to bereduced rather than expanded as planned, and we shall not be able to use themachinery which we have been pressing United States to send us (completion of delivery has been promised for April).(4) As has already been said, the various measures to increase carrying capacity and cut traffic might well go a long way to achieve a statistical balancewere it not for the increased production of opencast and deep mined coal. this increase is calculated at 400,000 tons now, rising, according to the Ministry of fuel and Power, to 2,000,000 tons at the end of the period. Whether thismaximum figure will be achieved during the period remains to be seen, and, if:achieved, whether it should all be carried must be considered in light of otherclaimants on tonnage and needs then current. In any event, a very-substantial&apos;amount above 400,000 per month will have to be moved in the later part of theperiod if the Ministry of Fuel and Power appreciation of the situation is correct.. 16. We therefore recommend that all the other expedients we suggest should,be pursued, and, in addition (1) The Ministry of Fuel and Power, who are actively pursuing all possible measures of further rationalisation of distribution, should be asked to repdrtofficially on this aspect. (Roughly 30 per cent, of the mined coal leaves: thepithead in complete trains in the Midland area, but other Regions may not.beas good.)(2) The Ministry of Fuel and Power are emphatic that the stacking of coalnear the pithead would in no sense be a cure. Rather, in their view, must weconcentrate every effort on moving coal direct from pit to consumer or to depotsnear the point of use. Any potential stacking facilities should not, however, be lost sight of.(3) Delays in the loading at pitheads are probably not all due to shortageof wagons. Although the incentive to the pit to load quickly is obvious, theremay be labour difficulties at certain points. ,(4) In view of the world shortage of coal at the present time, it wouldappear disastrous if opencast production had to cease. Inevitably there will bea large accumulation near sites for a time and always a considerable risk of fire,but to refuse to take the American machinery now would be almost impossible.We should frankly state the position to the Americans, and operate themachinery in accordance with the position then current, i.e., in our present labourstringency work at less than full rate until there is a prospect of this coal beingcarried to consumers:Publicity Campaign.17. As important as any specific measures referred to above is the necessity to drive home to every inhabitant of these isles the absolute necessity ofeconomising transport.A note on this subject is contained in Annex II, but it will suffice to sayhere that now is the opportunity to link such a campaign to &quot; the Climax.&quot; the campaign must go further than economy of travel, and should point to variouslines of action, within the power of many to achieve, which directly or indirectlywill ease the situation.There might also be a special campaign directed to collieries, GoalDistributors, Public Utility Companies, and other large coal users to deal morepromptly with coal wagons.
ANNEX II.POINTS FOR NATIONAL PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN.1.   Relate this specifically to impending operations.2. Explain the great strain on the transport system of the enormous move-ment of troops and. military material that is involved.3. Explain in simple language that essential war production and theeconomic life of the country cannot be maintained unless every member of thecommunity makes a specific and individual contribution at this time.4. Strike the note that here is the opportunity for everyone to make a personal contribution of great value.   Create the sense of climax.5. Explain that it is not merely restriction of travel but reduction of purchases, using stocks whenever possible, sending as few letters or parcels aspossible, cutting out every movement of material or stores which is not absolutely essential. Special reference should be made to economy in coal, coke, gas and electricity as one of the ways to contribute.6. A special call to manufacturers to reduce wagon turn round. No wagonsshould ever fail to be unloaded within twenty-four hours. This must be a first charge on firms&apos; labour.7. Explain the necessity for considerable transfers of labour from other employment to transport work with a view to easing the Ministry of Labour&apos;stask in effecting transfers.8.   Use Press, Screen and Radio; and mobilise all the resources we have.9.   Plan the campaign to run through from early February onwards.
