THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT p ,Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1944. 2^3SECRET.W.P. (44) 95.9th February, 1944.WAR CABINET.ANGLO-AMERICAN DISCUSSIONS UNDER ARTICLE VII.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.THIS is the Gold Standard ail over again.And at a moment when the United States has all the gold, and GreatBritain has none of it.We tie our sterling to dollars with the right to depreciate 10 per cent., andanother 10 per cent, with the consent of the International Monetary Union, whichmight be refused.This compares with up to 50 per cent, depreciation of the dollar ten years ago.We have the benefit of a fund of  325 million for Great Britain and theColonies on which we can draw for stabilisation purposes. But we oan onlyuse  80 million for this purpose in any one year.This compares with  1,270 million representing the sale to european countries of United States commodities in excess of purchases from the1st December, 1918, to&apos;the 1st July, 1920 one year aaid seven months.Copy No.    $ iJV -The penalties of reaching the Gold Standard after the last war were immense far beyond computation in money.(1) In 1919 we bought sterling through Morgans in New York for four months to protect the price, to the extent of our available resources.(2) Later in 1919 we bought francs, marks and lire in exchange for sterlingto sustain the European currencies, until that burden became unbearable.(3) In 1920 we began to supply credit for European countries whichdeveloped to huge proportions and most of the money was lost.(4) In 1922 we established Mr. Baldwin as Chancellor of the Exchequer, andin 1923 he settled the American debt.  The deal was costly and came to disaster.I The sole purpose of all this was the return to the Gold Standard.   This\   took place in 1925, and crashed in 1931.There is of course also the long record of loans to Roumania, Poland and czechoslovakia through the British Overseas Bank and thee British TradeCorporation and other banks; of loans to Austria and the attempt to sustain the Credit Anstalt; of more loans by our Joint Stock Banks to Germany; and ofthe Accepting Houses who were persuaded by the Bank of England to takeGerman paper, and who have been staggering under the load ever since.Finally, we secured credits of nearly  100 million from the United States*    and France in a last desperate effort to sustain the policy that had done us suchincredible injury.   The speculators got the benefit of most of this fund.[26900]   -
If this time we adopt the Gold Standard again, with all the experience wehave sustained, then we are denying the lessons of the past.In recounting our woes I make no mention of the unemployment we sufferedthrough so many years.Now when the war ends, there will probably be only two currencies ofimportance in the world sterling and the dollar. Of the two, sterling will bethe more widely used. And, if the Americans continue their present financial policy, sterling may be stronger than the dollar too.We should devote ourselves to upholding the world-wide use of sterling. Weshould adopt the policy of lending to foreign countries only for the purpose of extending trade and not for helping exchanges.We should reject the plan to launch the Gold Standard all over again. Weshould not allow the United States to lassoo us this time.b.Gwydyr House, Whitehall, S.W. 1,9th February, 1944.
