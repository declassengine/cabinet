THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (4.4.) 60.2Qth January, 1944.WAR CABINET.COMMITTEE ON WIDOWS&apos;  WAR PENSIONS AND  GRATUITIES.Report.1. We were appointed on the 4th November, 1943, &quot; to consider the viewsof the Service Ministers and the Minister of Pensions and to make recommenda-tions to the War Cabinet&apos;&apos; on the question of the pensions payable to the widows of retired Flag Officers re-employed as Commodores of Convoy and the conditionsof payment of the &quot; Killed in Action &quot; gratuity (see W.M. (43) 150th Conclusions,Minute 5).I. Pensions of Widows of retired Flag Officers re-employed as Commodores^ of Convoy.2. We have considered the possibility that in cases of this nature the Service, Departments might re-employ the officer on the basis of a special contract ofservice,, under which they would compensate the widow by reference to the losssuffered by the cutting off of the officer&apos;s retired pay, some part of which she might otherwise have expected to enjoy for a greater or less number of years.Such a scheme would be feasible. But if based on expectations of life it wouldinvolve very wide disparities between the payments made to individual widowswhose circumstances might not be greatly dissimilar. These disparities, based, asthey would be, on somewhat abstruse calculations, would be difficult to explain,the more so as they would themselves be based on arbitrary assumptions as to theproportion of an officer&apos;s pension which is used for the benefit of his wife. Ascheme of this kind would therefore in our view result in dissatisfaction andcontroversy.  Further, a very dangerous principle would be involved.3. We have therefore come to the conclusion that it would be preferable to supplement the attributable pension payable under the present rules by somereadily ascertainable amount which would take account of the officer&apos;s previousrank and service, while at the same time not giving the widow as much as the widow of an officer killed while actually discharging the responsibilities of ahigher rank. We think that a fair and reasonable compromise-though of course a perfectly arbitrary one would be to allow the widow to receive, in additionto the attributable pension of the rank in which the officer was re-employed,one-half of the difference between that amount and the attributable pensionappropriate to the highest rank in which the officer served on a substantive basisbefore his retirement. Such an arrangement might apply retrospectively to widows of those Commodores of Convoy who have already lost their lives, so faras the question arises. It might be necessary to admit also a few other special cases. In future it should apply only to the widows of officers re-employed onthe basis of a special contract of service. We suggest that the contract should be entered into at the date of re-employment or as soon as might be in the case ofexisting re-employed officers in the designated category. The additional pension would be payable by the employing Department as part of i the contract.4. An arrangement on these lines would be by no means free from objection,but would have the advantage of being based on no particular principle, and ofnot being directly linked with the ordinary pensions code, with which it would[26801]
not easily be reconcilable.   In the case of Lady Brownrigg it would produce, in place of the attributable pension of the widow of  a Commodore ( 290), 290-h  125 (i.e., half the difference between a Commodore&apos;s widow&apos;s pension,and an Admiral&apos;s widow&apos;s pension  540) or  415 in all.5. We suggest that the classes of officers to which the special arrangement would apply should be left to be agreed between the Service Departments andthe Treasury. In our view, a suitable definition would be : &quot; Pensioned officersperforming work of a specially hazardous character in ranks lower than the rankin which they were pensioned.&quot;6. It would be understood that employment would be regarded as &quot; speciallyhazardous &quot; for the purpose of the concession only where this would be true ofthe class of employment as a whole, and the fact that an individual officer of a class whose duties are not in general exceptionally hazardous might on occasionincur exceptional risks, e.g., through a bomb accident or through being requiredto make a journey by air, would not entitle his widow (in the event of his death) tothe special terms. The arrangement should not apply to retired officers serving in the Home Guard.7. We have discussed this proposal with the Service Ministers and theMinister of Pensions, and it is acceptable to them. We accordingly recommend it for the approval of the War Cabinet.II. Killed in Action Gratuity.8. The origin and conditions of payment of this gratuity are fullydescribed in the Memorandum by the Minister of Pensions dated the26th October, 1943 (W.P. (43) 483). The gratuity, which is restricted to widows of officers and whose death occurs in certain special circumstances and is notpayable in any event in the case of other ranks, dates from a time when injuriesor death sustained in the course of active operations against the enemy were considered worthy of more generous compensation than disabilities contracted inother circumstances. Under present-day conditions the gratuity is illogical andanachronistic, and it is generally agreed that it can be defended only as ahistoric survival.9. The First Lord of the Admiralty has pressed strongly for an extension ofthe basis of payment of the gratuity to cover all cases of &quot; violent death duedirectly to the special risks of war service,&quot; and has referred to the anomaliesarising from the payment of the gratuity under the conditions at present in force.10. The Minister of Pensions, on the other hand, has experienced nodifficulty in the administration of the gratuity as at present provided, and hasbeen able to satisfy such Parliamentary criticism as has arisen by reference to the traditional nature of the gratuity.11. An extension of the basis of payment of the Killed in Action gratuityon the lines proposed by the First Lord of the Admiralty, while removing someanomalies, would still leave others. For example, the gratuity would be payable to the widow of an officer accidentally killed in a collision between two tanksduring manoeuvres, but it would be refused for an officer dying from diseaseattributable to service in the field.12. Such an extension, moreover, by departing from the traditional basisof the payment of the gratuity, would open the door to claims for a similarextension in many other directions. In particular, it would be indefensible any longer to confine the gratuity to the widows of officers to the exclusion of other ranks. We understand, further, that strong claims would arise from theMerchant Navy for a similar concession in their case.13. It is true that payment of the gratuity was made during the last warunder conditions similar to those now proposed by the First Lord of theAdmiralty without any further extension being found necessary. In our view,however, it would be impracticable to maintain a similar position if the basis ofthe gratuity were extended at this stage of the war.
14. Logically, the proper course would be to abolish the gratuity altogether.We regard this course as impracticable, at least so long as the present warcontinues. The choice, therefore, lies between a radical modification of the basisof payment of the gratuity, involving its extension both to other ranks and to the mercantile Marine, or the restriction of the gratuity as now provided strictly to cases satisfying the conception of action against the enemy.15. We do not think that a general extension of the gratuity on the linesof the first alternative would be warranted. The whole scheme of war pensionswas subject to a comprehensive review only a few months ago when a number of substantial improvements were introduced and it is unnecessary and would be undesirable at this stage to re-open the question. On the Avhole, therefore, werecommend that no change should be made in the present basis of payment of thisgratuity. We understand that the Service Ministers (with, the exception of theFirst Lord of the Admiralty) and the Minister of Pensions are prepared to accept this recommendation.(Initialled) J.
