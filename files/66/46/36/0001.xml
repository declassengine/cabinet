f^HlS E0CUfo3NT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS- BRITANNIC hiSJ5,0 R B TTth^Feb ruary Jt 1944WAR CABINISTSTAFFING; OF rHE civil. SERVICE jxjssIMMEDIATE POST &quot;-EAR PERIODMemor an dura &quot;by the Chancellor of th e exchequer eoiierDetailed proposals for the staffing of the Civil service in the period immediately succeeding the conclusion ofhostilities with Germany have &quot;been worked out by the treasury in consultation with other Departments,      The ministerial committee on the Machinery of Government, after examination ofthe proposals, approved them for discussion with the staff side representatives on the National i/hitley Council,,2. These discussions have begun and will &quot;be pressed forward with all possible speed.      Even so, however,, some little time must elapse before the results can be submitted for final Ministerial approval.&quot;     In the interval, the absenceof any indication of the Government&apos;s general approach to theproblem may be a cause of co intensification considerable   . embarrassment0Moreover, the constitution of the Staff Side is such thattheir representatives will need to seek instructions, through-out the current negotiations, both from the National staff side as a whole (consisting of about 25 members) and from theExecutive Committees of the principal Associations,        on certain points some consultation with the membership of the-Associations may also be involved.      The danger of a leakage -of information,  probably in a garbled form, needs no emphasis.3. In these circumstances,   I have come to the conclusionthat it would be wise to publish a short statement in general terms regarding the main lines of the proposals at present under consideration.      I annex a draft of such a statement which,  if ray colleagues agree, &quot;I would propose to make at avery early date in the&apos; House of Commons in reply to an arrangedQuestion.4. &quot;Obviously, there are certain disadvantages in ventilatingthese questions at the present stage.      The statement may, forexample,  stimulate representations in favour of an outrightpreference for ex-Service personnel of the kind which operatedafter the last war.      On the other hand,  not only must  this issue be faced sooner or later, but (i) the broad principlescontained in the draft statement have been generally approvedby the Ministers principally concerned, any difference ofopinion being solely on detail;    and (ii) there are certaincompensating advantages in suitable publicity -- both in orderto mould nub lie opinion and to give the Government anopportunity of assessing public reaction before they are definitely committed to. specific proposals.      Finally, thereis what seems to me-to be&quot;the conclusive argument that withouta statement of this kind we may be faced by an ill-timed andgarbled leakage of inforraation,,5. I, therefore,  seek my colleagues &apos; approval to the issueof a statement on the lines of the attached&quot; draft,      I ought to add that the Staff Side&quot; representatives, while not committed to the contents of the statement,  entirely concur in theproposed procedure which will,  in their view,  relieve them ofconsiderable embarrassment.*E3TY&apos; S GOVERNMENT -        /---------------...     /COPY NO.    b 3

ANNDraft, ^tajb^cjiient -on ,Recru, itment to the Civil 3srvicein the Tiranecliate ?bst Vfer period the Government have &quot;been considering what measures .should be taken for recruitment to the Civil Service in theimmediate post war period,2. &quot;During the war there has be en very little recruitment to the established Service.      All open competitiveexaminations have been suspended,      There are at present only 215,000 established Civil Servants  (plus a further70,000 absent on war service) and many of these are already at or over normal retiring age.        The number of establishedCivil Servants in April,  1939,,, was 290,000.      as a result,the established Civil Service will be a good deal smaller atthe end of the war than it was at the. beginning,,3. Whatever form our economy may take after the war,  itseems reasonably certain that the complexity of administration will, at anyrate for many years, be greater than it was before the war.,      The established Civil Service will need the substantial re inf or cement of a steady flow of young&apos; recruitsof good educational standards, who will be available to help with the many and difficult problems of reconstruction,  and toprovide an experienced body of qualified staff in the years to come.      After the last war recruitment by open competitiveexaminations was not resumed until 1925 for the generalAdministrative class,.  1928 for the general Executive class,and 1927 for the general Clerical class.      After this war,however, it should be an immediate objective,  in theGovernment 5s view, obo recruit,  at the earliest possible moment, properly qualified personnel at ages appropriate toentry on a permanent career.4. It is in any event the Governments  intention thatsafter the war,  everything possible shall be done to assistthe establishment&apos; in careers of those who have missed their normal opportunity of achieving this as a result of the war,or of their own war service. &apos;    It appears to the Governmentonly equitable,.so far as the Civil Service is concerned, thatthe main source of recruits in the immediate post war period should be from those &quot;who would have had an opportunity of competing for.the Service in the  normal course, but for the interruption of the war..      Generally speaking,  this will meanthose who have gone into some form of war service straightfrom school or university.,      Recruitment by open competition from this source will serve very well the main object ofsecuring a steady flow of appropriately qualified personneldu ring t he r e c o ns t r uc 11 o n per i o dc5. Every care must be taken, in making the necessary administrative arrangements, to ensure that men and women who have been with the Forces during the war,  should be at no disadvantage in competing with civilians,  either as aresult of the particular form their war service may havetaken, or because their demobilisation may,  in some cases,take place rather late.      Any arrangements made for recruitment to the Civil Service immediately after the war should ensure that generous treatment is given to suitablecandidates from the Forces,.

.6. During the whole  3f the reconstruction period,the work of jt he Civil service must be carried on,probably -under very severe pressure.      TheGovernment/consi&amp;er that arrangements will be neededfur the retention :;f-some of the existing temporary staff who are too old to. be eligible for the opencompetitions,  particularly staff who have shownspecial aptitude for the work of administration. and who hove acquired valuable experience of theGovernment service.      No temporary staff shoul-elr, hr^L-C,haioever9 be retained in the Civil Service unless their quality is sufficiently high and theirretention plainly in the Public interest, /7. questions of the kind referred to  in this statement are&apos; appropriate opriat e for discussion with CivilService staff representatives through the Whit leymachinery.      The Government have, accordingly,referred the matter to the National Whitley council with a request that specific proposals,  which it ishoped can be agreed be twoen.the two Sides of theCouncil,  should be submitted to them as soon aspos sible.8. Further statements will be made from time totime as proposals are submitted by .the Council and considered by the Government.      Statements willalso be made on other matters affecting the postwar Civil Service.
