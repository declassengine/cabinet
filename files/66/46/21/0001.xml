(44) 71.2nd February, 1944.WAR CABINET.RE-ALLOCATION OF MAN-POWER DURING THE transition period BETWEEN THE END OF THE WAR IN EUROPE ANDTHE END OF THE WAR IN. JAPAN.Note by the Minister of Labour and National Service.IN accordance with the conclusions of the War Cabinet on the 15th December,1943 (W.M. (43) 170th Conclusions, Minute 2), I have had further discussions with the Service Ministers and. other Ministers directly concerned, apart fromthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the basis of the proposals previously outlined in my memorandum W.P. (43) 564.I informed the Chancellor of the proposals and he is aware that I have been proceeding with my discussions with the Service and other Ministers.The annexed note sets out the scheme as it has been worked out in the lightof these discussions. Its main principles have been accepted by the ministers concerned but one or two questions of detail are still under consideration.E. B.2nd February, 1944.ANNEX.1. The following proposals are based on the principle that this is one war which will not end until Japan has been defeated. No general demobilisationcan, therefore, take place until the end of the war and compulsory recruitment ofmen for the Forces will be continued. It will apply both to those reaching theage of 18 and to young men, mainly in the munitions industries, whose call-uphas hitherto been deferred. The existing powers of control over industry andlabour will also have to be maintained,It is- accordingly proposed that any releases of men from the Forces duringthe transition period, must be expressed, not as demobilisation, but as reallocationof man-power between the Forces and Industry.2. This reallocation of man-power must be subject to the two conditions laiddown by the Jowitt Committee as essential to any scheme of military demobilisa-tion, viz. : &apos;(a) that it must be subject to overriding military and international needs; and(b) that on the whole it must be accepted as fair and reasonable by the forces and the public.3. To carry the acceptance and goodwill of the Forces and the public, it isconsidered essential that the public statement on the scheme should be made by[26851]
the Prime Minister and it is suggested that it might be against the background of the commitments entered into with our Allies at the Teheran and, CairoConferences. But before the scheme is publicly announced, it is vital that theground should have been prepared :(a) by discussion in Parliament which it is thought must be in Secret Session ;(&amp;) by discussion with industry under pledge of secrecy; and(c) by exposition to the press shortly before the public announcement, withthe safeguard of an embargo on premature disclosure.If the scheme is settled in time arrangements could be made for the issue ofan explanatory document to the Forces, immediately after the statement, tocoincide with the press releases; there would be great advantages in this.Re-allocation Proposals.4.   In effecting the re-allocation of man-power it is proposed (a) that the present system of allocations of man-power between departments should continue; and(&amp;) that the releases from the Forces should be on two different bases.5. First of all, men no longer required by the Forces on Military groundswould be released on an age and length of service basis.* (These are subsequentlyreferred to as Class &quot; A.&quot;) This is in accordance with the main recommendationof the Jowitt Committee. The proposals made in paragraph 1 for continuing the call-up of young men would enable the release of the Class &quot; A &quot; men to be speededup. The release of men would begin as soon as practicable after the EuropeanArmistice but, for the reasons given in paragraph 13 of the Report of the JowittCommittee, a standstill period would be necessary. This would be kept as shortas possible and it is anticipated that, in any event, some of the men in Class &quot; A &apos;;(e.g., men over 50 years of age) could be released almost immediately after theArmistice.6. Secondly, men needed to assist in the reconstruction of the countrypreparatory to general demobilisation would be transferred out of turn from theForces to Industry for certain specified reconstruction employments on theapplication of the Minister of Labour. (These men are subsequently referred toas class &quot;B.&quot;) In addition there would continue to be a strictly limited numberof specialists transferred on an individual basis under the current procedure (seeparagraph 10).7. In accordance with present practice governing releases to Industry, menwho are selected for inclusion in Class &quot; B &quot; will not be compelled to accepttransfer, and it will be open to them to await their turn under the age and lengthof service rule. The transfer of men in Class &quot; B &quot; would not begin until a starthad been made with the men in Class &quot;A,&quot; and, in order that the release on industrial grounds should not affect the numbers of Class &apos;&apos; A &quot; released, it isproposed that additional numbers of young men at present deferred should becalled up.8. The numbers to be transferred to Industry under Class &quot; B &quot; must, inany event, be kept considerably lower than those in Class &apos;: A.&quot; If, for example,500,000 men are to be released from the Forces under Class &quot; A,&quot; then the numberof men who might be transferred out of their turn over the same period could,it is thought, be of the order of 50,000-60,000. The actual numbers for transferin Class &apos;: B &quot; would be determined from time to time in the light of (i) the immediate requirements of the reconstruction employments; and(ii) the extent to which those requirements will be met by men being releasedunder Class &quot; A &quot; and by transfer from munitions and other industriesat home.When the number for each occupation has been settled, it is suggested that the selection of men up to that number should be made by applying the age and length of service principle : e.g., if 5,000 bricklayers are to be transferred under* Owing to the particular conditions in the Eoyal Navy, selection by age and service, andthe application of the Military Needs condition, will inevitably operate to some extent unevenlyover the various branches and ratings. The same position is broadly true in the Eoyal AirForce.
Class &quot; B &quot; they should come from the &apos;; age and length of service &quot; groups nextin order to those being released under Class &quot; A.&quot; On this basis, the men wouldbe identified by the Service Departments and individual instructions for releasewould be sent to the units. This method avoids the necessity for obtainingparticulars from employers, but we would have to accept the risk of a fairnumber of mistakes being made. All Class &quot; B &quot; men would, however, be underdirection for employment purposes and men who themselves misrepresent their qualifications could be recalled to the Forces.Distinction between Class &quot; A &quot; and Class &quot; B.&quot;9. To preserve the confidence of the Services in the fairness of the schemeit is vitally necessary that there should be a definite distinction between the two classes, and that it should be made clear to the Services as a whole that the mentransferred out of turn will not have the same benefits as those released in their turn. Accordingly, it is proposed that there should be different conditions of release for the two classes, as follows : Class &quot;A.&quot;(1) They would be placed to a special class of Reserve, from which they wouldbe recalled only in an extreme emergency, and then only by classes, notindividually.(2) On release, they would be given eight weeks&apos; furlough with full pay,ration allowance and family or dependants allowance.Payment would be made by an advance, according to rank, on theday of release, the remainder being paid through the Post Office at regular intervals.At the end of the period of eight weeks men who&quot;, had had aminimum of six months&apos; foreign service would be given a further period of regular payments assessed according to the length of that service,* and their Service Pay accounts would then be closed.When their Service Pay accounts were closed any War Gratuityor Post-war credit due would be placed to their credit in the PostOffice Savings Bank.(3) No Unemployment Benefit would be payable until the end of the periodcorresponding to the periodic payments under (2).(4) On the day of release they would be given civilian clothes and serviceclothes in accordance with the agreement reached on the reconstruction committee.(5) They would be permitted to exercise their reinstatement rights and go back to their old jobs. If they had no jobs to which to return, theywould be permitted to seek employment where they wished. If theysought employment at the Employment Exchanges they would beplaced in employment in accordance with the preferences. If they hadnot been placed in employment by the time they came on to Unemploy-ment Benefit, directions would if necessary and appropriate then beissued.Class &quot; B.&quot;(1) They would be placed to Class &quot; W &quot; Reserve in the case of the Army,and a corresponding Reserve in the case of the other Services, fromwhich they would be recalled individually to the Forces if they dis-continued in their reconstruction employment.(2) On release they would be given a &quot; transfer grant &quot; of four weeks&apos; fullpay, ration allowance and family or dependants allowance, an advanceaccording to rank being paid on the day of release, the remainder being paid on the tenth day after release.Any credits on account of foreign service, war gratuity, and Post-War Credit, would be held in suspense until the end of the war, whenthey would be placed to their credit in the Post Office Savings Bank.(3) No Unemployment Benefit would be payable until four weeks after release.(4) On the day of release they would be given civilian clothes and serviceclothes in accordance with the agreement reached on the reconstruction committee.* The method of assessing these payments in respect of foreign service will vary as betweenthe Services. Proposals designed to meet the conditions in each Service have been agreedinterdepartmentally and are now under consideration by the Service Ministers.
(5) They would be directed to their reconstruction employments. This would preserve their reinstatement rights to the end of the war and alsoprevent them from leaving their jobs without the permission of theNational Service Officer.(6) A Class &quot;E &quot; man would not be able to transfer to Class &quot;A,&quot; eventhough he might have become eligible for it at a later date.It is suggested that (2) above should be subject to a minimum of six months&apos;service with the Colours, and also (4) as concerns the issue of civilian clothes.Specialists.10. A limited number of specialists would also be transferred from theForces on an individual basis on the lines of existing practice. The procedure fordealing with these cases, based on recommendations from Government Depart-ments, would be strengthened.   These would be treated as Class &quot; B.&quot;11. Specialists released before the end of the European War will remain in class W (or corresponding) reserve unless recalled to the Forces on the recom-mendation of the Minister of Labour. They will not be treated as Class &quot; B &quot;but. when finally discharged at the end of the emergency they would receive, inthe form of a Post Office Savings Bank credit, any war gratuity, post-war credit and grant for foreign service, to which they are entitled.Women.12. Subject to any special conditions of release which may be adopted forwomen in the Services, the financial treatment of women would be on the same lines as for men.Interdepartmental Committee.13: The Committee, under the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministryof Labour, proposed in paragraph 3 of the Jowitt Report, should be set up withoutdelay to co-ordinate the necessary preparations for applying the scheme for releaseas set out above.   The Committee would keep under constant review (i) the prospective numbers to be released from the Forces under Class &quot;A&quot;classified by industries and occupations;(ii) the numbers of civilians becoming available for reconstruction employ-men ts ;(iii) the numbers of young men available for call-up;and would determine the numbers to be transferred under Class &quot; B &quot; as proposedin paragraph 8. The Committee would exercise general control over the transferof individual specialists.Compassionate Releases and Men already discharged.14. The scheme as outlined above provides for releases on age and lengthof service and industrial grounds. To complete the picture reference shouldbe made to releases and discharges outside the scheme, viz. : (i) Men granted priority release after the Armistice on compassionate grounds (to be referred to as Class &quot; C &quot;). Like men released on similar grounds before the Armistice they would receive, normallyat the end of the emergency, a Post Office Savings Bank credit cover-ing war gratuity and Post-War Credit, and a grant for foreign service. Earlier payment would be made in special cases whererelease is granted for an indefinite period and there is financialhardship.(ii) Men who at the end of the European war have already been dischargedfor reasons other than misconduct (i.e., mainly on medical grounds).They would receive as soon as possible a Post Office Savings BankCredit as in (i).
