THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 76.3rd February, 1944.&apos;SHIPMENTS OF FOOD GRAINS TO INDIA.Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN the absence of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, I have been askedto place the attached, Colonial Office memorandum before my colleagues.Dominions Office., 3rd February, 1944.&quot;Memorandum by the Colonial Office.THE memorandum by the Secretary of State for India W.P. (44) 63 of the28th January puts before the Cabinet India&apos;s requirements of imported food grains.The Colonial Office do not wish to complicate an already difficult situation,but feel bound to draw attention to the imperative need of Ceylon for rice.The strategic importance of Ceylon is hardly if at all less than that of India.For naval purposes it is to be our advance base. In addition, Ceylon is by far themost important source of natural rubber and produces a large part of the tea onwhich the United Kingdom tea ration depends. Ceylon also supplies substantial quantities of copra and coconut oil, to which the Ministry of Food are understood to attach importance.The island has always been very largely dependent upon imported rice.Pre-war imports averaged over half a million tons a year against local productionof only about 200,000 tons.With the dislocation of rice supplies caused by the loss of Burma and othercountries in South-East Asia, Ceylon rice imports had to be cut very drasticallyand minimum essential requirements have been reduced to 10,000 tons a month, orless than a quarter of the pre-war average. This has. only been made possible bya reduction in the rice ration to estate labour disputes*ers and others to 1 lb. per head perweek or one-sixth of the pre-war ration.*The authorities in Ceylon are satisfied that the present reduced rice ration ofone-sixth of the pre-war scale cannot be further reduced. If it were, immediateadverse results must be expected, the full repercussions of which cannot be fore-told. Clearly, however, both essential production of rubber, tea, &amp;c, and public order must be expected to suffer. Estate production of rubber and tea is particu-larly vulnerable because a large proportion of the labour is immigrant SouthIndian labour, which would return to India if dissatisfied.The only source to which Ceylon can look for rice for the greater part of therest of this year is India. An allocation of 50,000 tons of rice was made to ceylon from the purchase of 100,000 tons which the Ministry of Food negotiatedfrom the current Egyptian rice crop, but deliveries have fallen very far short ofexpectations. When the present Egyptian supplies have been exhausted no morerice will be obtainable from Egypt until the next crop at the end of this year.  Two* The total cereal ration is at present 41b. per head, the balance of 31b. being made up inother grains, principally flour.[26869]Copy No,WAR CABINET.
shipments have been authorised during the last few months by the Minister ofWar Transport from Brazil, but the Ministry of. War Transport consider it quite impossible from the shipping point of view to programme Ceylon&apos;s requirements from Brazil as a regular practice.Thus Ceylon can look to no other source but India for her further supplies for the remainder of the year.The difficulties with which the Government of India are faced in theirown food situation are fully understood. Ceylon&apos;s minimum essential require-ment of 10,000 tons a month is, however, an insignificant fraction of the totalIndian rice crop estimated by the Secretary of State for India at 26 million tons for the current season. The objection to exporting rice from India to ceylon is doubtless not so much the actual quantity involved, but the adversepsychological effect of permitting any export of food-stuffs. If, however, india is to receive substantial imports of other food grains, surely this expected adverse effect would be obviated.The Colonial Office urge, therefore, that it be made a condition of importassistance to India that the. Government of India agree, in return, to permit the export of 10,000 tons a month of rice to Ceylon to meet the minimumessential requirements of the island. The Governor of Ceylon states that thepresent Ceylon cereal ration of 4 lb. per head per week, of which only 1 lb.is rice, compares with a ration of 7 lb. in Bombay and 8 lb. in Calcutta.If this statement is correct, could it not be used judiciously in any propagandarequired to counter opposition to the small shipments of rice which Ceylonrequires ?The Minister of Food is understood to desire that deliveries of rice from egypt to Ceylon should cease as soon as possible in order to safeguard require-ments in the Middle East itself. It is, therefore, suggested that the Governmentof India be requested to agree to the export of 10,000 tons a month of riceto Ceylon, from as early a date as possible, but that further shipments from egypt to&quot; Ceylon should not be cancelled until actual deliveries from India onthe scale required have been received.Colonial Office, 3rd February, 1944.
