&apos; DOCUMENT IB THE PROPERTY OP.HI8 BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;:S GOVERNMENT)    \ 7 0SECRETW.P.(44)79WITHDRAWAL; -OF CIVIL STAFFS PROM SERVICE DEPARTMENTS .Memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilMy colleagues will wish to know the reasons for whichthe Lord Presidentfs Committee reached the conclusion against which the Service   Ministers have appealed to the PrimeMinister and Minister of Defence in their minute of the 28thJanuary which has been circulated as W,P., (44)62- ,20 Under the Wax  Cabinet decisions on Manpower for 1944a considerable number -of men and women will be. required forthe armed forces,  especially during the early months of theyear*      In addition many sections of industry .engaged on workof the highest priority will continue to expands      In orderto carry out these decisions substantial numbers of women and,particularly of mobile women? will be roquiredo3c It was in order to meet this requirement that- theMinister of Labour and National Service put forward the pro-posals contained in his Memorandum(L-Po (43) 280),.     Theseproposals may be summarised as follows:-(a) The withdrawal without prior substitution of women ofspecif ied age classes from selected occupations in the munitions industries and from certain other industries as awhole,  irrespective of the nature of their occupation      (inthe first instance it is proposed to specify only women of the1923 age for withdrawal.,      It may. however, be necessary later to withdraw women in other age classes or to extend the lists of the occupations and industries from Which they are,  in thefirst instance,  to be withdrawn)c(b) The application of a similar scheme to women in theservice     of      Government Departments, subject to the exemption of women in certain specialised grades and to the right of departments to submit to the Kennet Committee proposals for theindividual exemption of women not included in the exemptedcategories on the ground that they possess special cjualifi cat ionsor are filling key posts, or that their withdrawal will seriously impair the efficiency of the work of the Department,4o In a Memorandum (Lape(43)288)  which.he circulated tothe Lord Presidents Committee on behalf of all three service departments the First Lord of the Admiralty expressed the strong opinion that the Service Departments should be entirelyexempt from the application of the scheme.,      The lord presidents Committee gave full consideration to the argumentsdeveloped by the First Lord both, in his paper and orally at the meetings      It was pointed out however that it would be opento the Service Departments, as .to other Departments, to make representations to the Kennet Committee in regard to individualcasesr,     The Committee felt that the Government would be subjected to justifiable criticism if the Government departments as a whole were exempted from the scheme which it was proposedto -supply to essential industry;    and that    if the scheme were applied to other Government Departments but an exception werema do ^in the case ^of the Service Departments,  considerable ill-feeling would be created among the staffs of non-exempted4TH FEBRUARY,  1944WAR CABINET

171Departments and the effect of the whole scheme wouldbe largely prejudiced,   .  The Committee did not thereforefeel able to accede to the request of the ServiceMinisterso58 The issue as the Lord President&apos;s Committee sawit was not whether all women of the 1923 age class shouldbe withdrawn from the Service Departments but whether theService Departments should; before being exempted fromthe obligation to release any particular woman or group ofwomen in the class? to bo called upon, like otherDepartments,  to satisfy an impartial body that their with-drawal would seriously impair the. efficiency of the workof the Departments.In paragraph 7 of their minute the service ministers claim that there is no room for the consider-ation of individual cases of women employed by theService Departments by the Kennet Committee or by anyother body who have&apos;no responsibility for theadministrative results of their decisions,      I shouldhave thought that this was an argument which could be equally well used by many other Departments, the efficient discharge of whose duties is no less essentialto the success of forthcoming operations, and one whichmust be rejected as being incompatible with any orderlysystem for the equitable allocation of our increasinglylimited manpower resources *6* In paragraph 2 of his letter of the 6th january to me the First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that the exemption of the Service Departments from the scope ofthe enquiry carried out by the Committee on the -Reduction of National Government Staffs strengthenedtheir case for exemption from the present scheme.      Thisis an argument which it is difficult to follow:    and theview taken by the Lord President&apos;s Committee was that departments who had already released large numbers of young women as a result of the operations of- theCommittee on the Reduction of National Government Staffswere likely to find it more difficult to release anysnbstantial number of women pf the 1923 class thanthose Departments who had been exempted from the scopeof the earlier enquiry *C.R.A.ivy Council Office, S.W.I.,4th February, 19440
