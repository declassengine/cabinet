(44) 24)10th February, 1944WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 232)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 0700 3rd February, to0700 10th February,1944[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Cabinet War Room
NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. An account of the successful operations by U.S. naval, air and land forces against the Marshall Islands is given in paragraphs 55-57.H.M. and allied warships have continued to give gun support in the Anzioand Formia areas.U.S. warships and carrier-borne aircraft have attacked Paramushiru in theKurile Islands.Four U-boats have been sunk and one possibly damaged.Home Waters.2. On &apos;the night of the 4th/5th H.M. destroyers T(matside, Talybont,Brissenden and Wensleydale engaged an Elbing-cl&amp;ss destroyer and two mine-sweepers off the N. coast of Brittany. One minesweeper was set on fire andprobably-sunk and the destroyer and the other minesweeper were damaged. two other Elbing destroyers were driven off. Our force sustained neither damage norcasualties.3. H.M.S. Slinger (escort carrier) was damaged by a mine off Orfordness onthe 6th, but subsequently reached port.As a result of an air raid on Tilbury on the 4th, the Tilbury Hotel(accommodating naval personnel) and other naval property were burnt out.There were no naval casualties.Mediterranean.4. The French cruiser Gloire and Dutch gun-boat Soemba bombarded enemy positions in the Formia area on the 3rd. They were later relieved byH.M.S. Mauritius (cruiser) and the Dutch gun-boat Flores. These two shipsbombarded.on the night of the 6th/7th, on the 7th, and on the night of the 7th/8th.They blew up an ammunition dump and caused many casualties. On the 8thH.M. cruisers Penelope and Dido operated in the same area in support of anattack by our troops.In the Anzio area H.M. destroyers Ulster and Urchin bombarded enemy positions in the bridgehead perimeter on the 6th with the U.S.S. Brooklyn(cruiser) standing by. On the 8th and 9th U.S.S. Brooklyn, with H.M. cruisers-Phoebe and Orion, assisted in breaking up a concentration of enemy artillery onthe left flank of our troops and continued to give fire support.U.S.S. Mavis (destroyer) on the 8th succeeded in intercepting and jammingthree glider bombs which fell nearby but caused no damage. No enemy aircraft were seen or heard.5. The town and harbour of Anzio have been frequently shelled and bombedduring the week. H.M.S. Loyal (destroyer), an infantry landing craft and twodumps were damaged. .Unloading of stores was hindered, by adverse weather on the 4th and 5th.but on the 6th weather moderated to allow 550 tons to be unloaded from Libertyships and 2,850 tons from tank-landing ships. On the 8th, 3,600 tons wereunloaded and on the 9th 4,200 tons.6. In the Adriatic on the night of the 3rd/4th, H.M. coastal craft sankthree schooners and took 85 prisoners in the Zara Channel (S.W. of Fiume), and sank a schooner and took 14 prisoners off Rogoznica (near Split).During the week H.M. destroyers Tumult and Teazer bombarded Senigallia(north of Ancona), Hvar and Starigrad (Yugoslavia) and Korcula Island.On the 6th, 25 Italians were evacuated from Albania by an Italian destroyerand other small craft..On the night of the 8th / 9th, coastal forces sank a tug with a pinnace in towoff the Dalmatian coast.Pacific.Kurile Islands.7. In the North Pacific, the Japanese naval and air base on Paramushiru,at.the northern end of the Kurile Islands, was bombarded in moonlight by anU.S. Task Force on the 4th; no opposition was encountered. A number of fires were started and a Japanese ship was hit and subsequently beached. the bombardment was followed by a bombing attack by two waves of naval aircraft.
^Solomons.8. At dawn on the 1st U.S. destroyers exchanged gunfire with shore batteries in the Eastern Buka Passage, and at noon they bombarded ChoiseulBay where barge activity had been reported the previous^ night. Very early onthe 4th three destroyers shelled enemy positions in N.W. Bougainville; somereturn fire was encountered and one destroyer was damaged. During the night of the 7th/8th M.T.B&amp;. attacked a large schooner in the entrance to Queen Carolaharbour, N.W. Buka Island.Anti-Submarine Operations.9. Twenty-three attacks have been reported, of which 12 were made by shore-based aircraft, one by submarine and the rest by surface craft. Two ofthe attacks were carried out in the Mediterranean and two against JapaneseU-boats in the Pacific.On the 6th an aircraft sank a U-boat S.W. of Ascension Isiand. Onthe 9th an escort group, including HM. sloops Woodpecker, Wildgoose, Starlingand Magpie, which was escorting a homeward-bound convoy, sank three U-boats in the S.W. Approaches. A U-boat was possibly damaged by a Wellington west of Ireland (R) on the 7th.Enemy Intelligence.German.10. The Koln was photographed at Kiel on the 7th. Prinz Eugen andNiirnberg are reported to have reached Gdynia on the 7th January and Leipzigto have anchored in Gdynia Roads on the 28th. On the 21st Scheer was atSwinemunde and Graf Zeppelin at Stettin. On the 18th Lutzow was seenexercising in Danzig Bay, and it is reasonable to suppose that she has beenrefitted and is now working up.At the end. of January a 100-ton floating crane, for use in connection withrepairs to Tirpitz. ran ashore on passage from Trondheim to Altenfjord, and isnot yet known to have been refloated.Only three docks in German ports are capable of taking Tirpitz. Theseare the graving dock at Hamburg and two floating docks which are at present at Gdynia.During the week a torpedo boat was seen to have been recently launchedat Fiume and repairs were in hand on the cruiser Gorizia at Spezia.Japanese.11.   Four cruisers, the Agano, Hoshiro, Oyodo and Yahagi, all of the new6,000-ton Agano class, have now been completed,   There are probably othersbuilding.   These cruisers are armed with 6&quot; guns and have a speed of over ,30 knots.U-boats.12. The main disposition of U-boats in the N. Atlantic appears to extendfrom a position 300 miles N.W. of Cape Wrath to 300 miles S.W. of Ireland (R).One or two U-boats may be operating off Newfoundland and to the west ofthe Azores.Less than 20 U-boats are now operating in the Mediterranean, but it seems probable that U-boats are attempting to pass through the Strait of Gibraltar.A Japanese U-boat may be in the Atlantic probably bound for WesternFrance carrying freight.The Germans are known, to have been experimenting with U-boats propelledunder water with internal combustion engines, and it is possible that this new method of propulsion may come into operational use in the near future.Enemy Attack on Shipping.13. During the week one ship was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat in the arabian Sea. The hospital ship Karapara (7,117 tons) was bombed offvizagapatam in the Bay of Bengal.14.   Shipping losses by enemy action in January totalled 108,400 tons whichwas 53,000 tons lower than the December figure.   There were no losses in the[26911] b
North or South Atlantic. The losses by U-boat which amounted to 78,000 tons,occurred in the Indian Ocean where 56,000 tons were sunk and in the Barents Seawhere the remaining 22,000 tons were lost. In-the Mediterranean .three ships(17,000 tons) were sunk by aircraft and one ship (7,000 tons) by mine. Five-ships in coastal convoys were sunk by E-boats in Home Waters. Marine risks accountedfor 13 ships totalling 44,000 tons, making a total of 152,000 tons lost duringthe month.Protection of Seaborne Trade.15. During the week ending the 6th, 857 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these, 258 were in ocean convoys and 599 in British coastal convoys. One escort carrier, one anti-aircraft ship, 59 destroyers (including12 U.S. destroyers) and 101 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes were employedon escort duties.Three homeward-bound ocean convoys, consisting of 88 ships, and fiveoutward-bound convoys, consisting of 170 ships, arrived at their destinationswithout loss.16. During January, 22 Ocean convoys of 517 ships arrived in the UnitedKingdom without loss. Nineteen outward-bound ocean convoys of 507 shipsreached their destinations without loss and two convoys, originally of 84 ships,lost four by U-boat attack before arrival. Three of the ships lost were in convoyto N. Russia.In the Western Atlantic and Caribbean 1,617 ships in 141 convoys reached their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying.17.&apos; Aircraft laid mines in the Baltic, off Oslo, the north coast of Franceand the Biscay ports.In the Mediterranean aircraft laid mines&apos; off Rhodes, Khalkis (Greece) andin Suda Bay (Crete).Enemy Minelaying, Allied Mines weeping.18.   There have been no reports of minelaying during the week.The dangerous areas in the eastern approaches to Portsmouth and offSt. John&apos;s, Newfoundland, have now been cancelled.The mine totals are 4,647 ground and 4,148 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.19. During the period the 1st/15th January 12 enemy ships totalling58,428 tons were sunk or captured; eight of these casualties, totalling 36,873 tons,occurred outside the Mediterranean and included three blockade-runners.20. During July, August, September and October of last year the enemy oretrade in the Bay of Biscay was virtually at a standstill, but after lengthynegotiations it was resumed. It is estimated that during November shipmentstotalled approximately 25,000 tons and in December over 40,000 tons.21. The tonnages of active enemy shipping available in the various areasin the Mediterranean on the 30th JNovember are estimated as follows : -	Tonnage Available.		Tonnage Required.		Non-Tanker.	Tanker.	Non-Tanker.	Tanker.iEgean    ... Adriatic   ...       ...       ...

On the 2nd the German s.s. Oria (2,127 tons) was seen at Rhodes, Thisis the first supply ship to have reached Rhodes since the end of August. On theprevious day the troopship Sieglinde was seen at Leros, whither she is reported tohave brought German reinforcements. The enemy&apos;s fastest and most valuablevEgean transport, the German-controlled Leda, is presumed to have been sunk by aircraft after leaving Samos on the 2nd, and the s.s. Capo Pino (4,785 tons) was probably sunk after leaving Suda on the 8th. A small tanker is reported to havebeen sunk recently by saboteurs at Piraeus. c .Russian Intelligence.23.   The present operational state of the Baltic fleet is two heavy cruisers,one minelaying cruiser and up to 12 destroyers and 50 submarines.   One 12-inch -battleship may be effective for limited operations.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern Sector.24. The Russians have cleared the coast of the Gulf of Finland and driventhe Germans back to their prepared defences on the River Narva. They havealso reached the north-eastern shores of Lake Peipus, and further east, have continued to press southwards astride the railway Leningrad-Luga. East of thelatter town the Germans still hold a narrow salient, but this has been very muchshortened in the past few days, and the Germans holding it seem likely to avoid the encirclement which at one time threatened them.Central Sector.25. The Germans have reported Russian attacks near Vitebsk, the objectof which is presumably to reach the Polotsk area, which forms the pivot of twolines to which the Germans might withdraw, namely, north to Lake Peipus and in.W. to Riga.Kiev Sector.26. By a fresh advance south of the Pripet Marshes the Russians capturedLuck and Rovno and later gained further ground SVV. of the latter town.: Theirforemost troops are therefore over 200 miles west of Kiev.After five days&apos; fighting Russian attacks from both east and west, againstthe Boguslav-Smela pocket linked up in the area S.W. of Smela, therebysurrounding a German force reported to consist of one armoured and some nineinfantry divisions. German attempts to break through the Russian ring from within and without have so far proved unavailing, and the chances of saving theencircled forces are decreasing.Dnieper Bend.27.   Fresh Russian attacks from N.E. of Krivoi Rog and N.E. of Nikopolbroke through strong German defences and on the 6th cut the only railway[26911] b 2
running westwards from Nikopol. On the 8th the Russians captured. Nikopolitself and eliminated the German bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnieper.They claim to have inflicted very heavy casualties on the Germans in the courseof these operations.Crimea.28. Russian attacks from the Kerch bridgehead have slackened. There arestill no signs of any German intention to withdraw from the Crimea.General.29. This has been an extremely successful wreek for the Russians, who havemade excellent progress SW. of Leningrad, advanced, further west from theKiev salient, surprised and surrounded one considerable force in the Boguslav-Smela area and routed another at Nikopol. In their present stretched conditionthe Germans can ill afford the losses they have recently suffered and those whichthey must expect, if, as seems probable, they are unable to relieve the forcessurrounded west of Smela.30. There has been no development of the battle at the two main points of conflict, Cassino and the Anzio bridgehead;In the north, the Eighth Army has been regrouping and carrying out thenormal patrols. The enemy has evidently withdrawn his long-established outpostsin the mountains and is concentrating on blocking the Sulmona and Gioio roads.As a result of this, British troops are now holding Torricella and Montenerodomoand report the road south from Casoli clear as far as Lama. The weather isbad and there have been heavy snowfalls.31. &quot;On the Fifth Army front, with French troops holding firm on thenorthern flank, U.S. troops have continued to batter away against the Cassinodefences. The main thrust has been in a westerly direction through the mountainsnorth of the town turning south after outflanking Cassino towards the mainFrosinone road. At the same time the attack on Cassino itself has continued.Slow progress has been made against the usual bitter resistance, and the forward troops were, by the 9th, some two miles west of Cassino. With both sidesusing tanks, heavy fighting has taken place throughout the week and is still continuing in the northern outskirts of Cassino where the Germans, althoughnearly cut off, are fighting with grim determination.There has been no heavy fighting along the Garigliano southwards toMinturno and activity has been confined to patrols.32. In the Anzio bridgehead the enemy has mounted heavy counter-attackswhich have forced our troops to give some ground south of Campoleone.On the night of the 3rd/4th and on the following day, two heavy attacks were launched against the base of the British salient which stretched up fromCarroceto to Campoleone railway station. These attacks, supported by tanks,succeeded in penetrating the British positions and one brigade was threatened with encirclement. A prompt counter-attack restored the situation and the forward troops were able to withdraw without great loss. Several more enemycounter-attacks have been launched without gaining any ground.On the right U.S. troops are still short of their objectives at Cisterna, wherethe enemy have concentrated strong forces including a considerable weight of artillery. On the evening of the 5th, a German counter-attack was reported to bedeveloping, but later in the night the situation was in hand and the forwardpositions were held.Yugoslavia.33. The enemy has resumed his efforts to split up the Partisan held territory in West Bosnia where a German force has re-occupied Jajce. A further german advance upon a town 10 miles NW. of Jajce was repulsed by the Partisans.In Croatia the Germans have re-occupied Otocac (25 miles south of Ogulin).Further north fighting continues between Zagrab and Novo Mesto.In Dalmatia the Partisans have attacked three German garrisons north ofSibenik and inflicted some 550 casualties upon the enemy. Fighting in the areacontinues.  The Germans have captured the islands of Uljan and Dugi Otok.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.39. Nearly 3,000 heavy bombers of the TJ.S, VIIIth  Air Force were despatched against targets in Germany and France, and over 2,000 aircraft ofthe A.E.A.F. against military objectives in France.In Italy, protection was provided for the beach-head, and enemy communica-tions were attacked north and south of Rome.The Russians destroyed over 100 enemy transport aircraft in the encirele-ment area of the Kiev salient.United Kingdom.40. On the night of the 3rd/4th, the enemy carried out a major operation intwo phases, the total number of sorties being estimated at 135 with 60 aircraft over this country and 17 penetrating to Greater London. The attacks failed to achieve any concentration, the area affected extending as far as Cambridgeshireand Gloucestershire, though the greater weight of bombs fell on either side ofthe Thames Estuary. An evident reluctance was shown to press home the attackon a well-defended target. Nine enemy aircraft were destroyed, four of whichwere shot down by A.A. fire.On the night of the 5th/6th a harassing attack was made by 15 or 20 Me. 410which operated over Kent, Essex and Greater London.No enemy aircraft were reported overland in daylight.34. On. the 30th January E.L.A.S. forces operating north of MountOlympus (Thessaly) inflicted 100 casualties upon the enemy, and in the Yaninaarea the Germans attacked Zervas forces on the 3rd February.In the civil war hostilities ceased on the 4th after continued E.L.A.S. attacks and advances along the whole front.Armistice negotiations are understood to have begun on the 5th under Britishauspices.Burma.A arakan.35. East of the Mayu Range the Japanese have opened a counter-offensiveby a movement round our left flank synchronised with frontal attacks, with the apparent object of disrupting our communications. In spite of some infiltrationby the Japanese, which has resulted in the isolation of some localities, our troops are maintaining their positions. West of the Mayu-Range our patrols have made further advances to a distance of about three miles.Chin Hills.36. There has been patrol activity, and our troops have successfully ambushedseveral small Japanese parties.New Guinea.37. In the coastal sector Australian troops have made further advancestowards Saidor without opposition but impeded by heavy rain, and are nowwithin five miles of the outposts of the U.S. garrison.In the Ramu Valley area, the Japanese made a counter-attack on the 4thwhich temporarily cut off two Australian platoons, who were, however, able to regain contact next day. The Japanese have now been thrown back to their original positions.On the 31st January, in Dutch New Guinea. Australian and Dutch troopsrepulsed a Japanese attempt to land near the mouth of the Eilander river. four of the eight Japanese landing craft were sunk, and there were at least 60 enemy casualties.New Britain.38. The Japanese appear to be withdrawing from western New Britain,but it is not yet clear how far this withdrawal extends. U.S. Marines from CapeGloucester have made further advances, capturing a large abandoned JapaneseCamp, and finding numbers of dead Japanese.
Home Waters.41. Tj^phoon bombers, of which two are missing, seriously damaged anM-class minesweeper off Brest and, off the Dutch coast, damaged a 2,500-ton ship and sank three barges. &apos; A torpedo-boat was probably damaged by a Halifaxin the Bay of Biscay.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 82 were despatched, laid 189sea-mines.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.42. U.S. heavy bombers operated on five days of the week, a total of2,983 aircraft being despatched against targets in Germany and against airfields and military objectives in France. The following are the details of the moreimportant attacks : Date.Target.3rd4th5 th6th8thWilhelmshaven port area   ...FrankfurtGiessenYillacoublay aircraft works and air-. fieldTours airfield ...Chateaudun airfield ...Orleans/Bricy airfieldChateaur-oix/Le Martinerie airfieldAvord airfield .......Caen airfield ...St. Andre de L&apos;Eure airfieldChateaudun airfield ...Evreux airfieldDieppe/St Aubin airfield    ...Frankfurt areaWiesbaden area       ...Military objectives near Fruges andGravelinesAttacked by-ToDnage.Results.552 Fortresses8.73 Fortresses andLiberators122 Fortresses andLiberators183 Fortresses90 liberators69 Fortresses andLiberators60 Fortresses49 Fortresses50 Fortresses - ...60 Fortresses60 Fortresses37 Fortresses21 Fortresses19 Fortresses100 Fortresses96 Fortresses110 Liberators1,127 : Not observed.800 I Not observed.275 i Not observed.338 ^Excellent.233 !

The attacks on targets in Germany were all made throughthick cloud and no photographic evidence is yet available. In the above opera-tions, in which over 3,750 fighters co-operated, 67 enemy aircraft were destroyed,13 were probably destroyed and 29 were damaged for the loss of 39 Fortresses,two Liberators and 25 fighters.Medium, light and fighter bombers of the Allied Expeditionary Air Forceoperated on six days of the week and maintained a heavy scale of effort againstmilitary objectives in the coastal areas of Northern France. Of the 2,188bombers despatched against these targets, 1,251 attacked, dropping 1,133 tons of bombs and firing 842 rocket projectiles. In addition, small-scale raids were madeon eight airfields in France, and Marauders dropped 71 tons of bombs onTergnier railway centre. From all these operations, four medium, four light and three fighter-bombers are missing. The 146 squadrons of fighters engaged on escort and diversionary sweeps encountered negligible opposition; threefighters are missing.Night.43. Owing to unfavourable weather, no large-scale operations were carriedout. Mosquitoes, of which 131 were despatched, made light raids on a numberof targets in Germany and 12 Lancasters attacked, in good visibility, the Gnomeand Phone engine factory at Limoges.Italy.44. Unfavourable weather conditions restricted operations, particularly ofthe strategic bomber force.   A substantial scale of effort, however, was provided
by aircraft engaged in tactical operations; fighters, fighter-bombers and light bombers flew a total of 3,582 sorties, and attacked communications and townsnorth and south of Rome, protected the beach-head, and carried out armedreconnaissances and patrols in the battle area.In the area of the Anzio beach-head enemy concentrations were strafed inthe assembly areas east of Ardea and S.W. of Albano; road or railway junctionswere bombed at Velletri, Cisterna, Marino, Frascati, Campoleone, Piedimonteand Sezze.Near Cassino heavy attacks were made on military objectives and direct hits were obtained at Villa San Lucia, Belmonte and Atina. At Sulmone successful attacks were made on the marshalling yards and the main line was cut, and inthe same vicinity the railway junction at Campo Di Gioye was bombed.To the north of Rome, road and railway communications were attacked.At Viterbo all the railways west of the towm were blocked and the railway bridgeto the south of the town was destroyed and collapsed on the road, blocking boththe railway and the road. A bridge at Manziana (24 miles N.W. of Rome) was hit, and other targets attacked were Civitavecchia, Vetralla (37 miles N.W. of rome), Orte, term  and Civita Castellana (27 miles N. of Rome).As a result of attacks on road and railway movement 118 M.T. vehicles,four locos and four railway waggons were destroyed and 185 M.T. vehicles,eight.locos and 41 railway waggons were damaged. In the battle area 32 enemy aircraft were destroyed against Allied losses of 15 fighters and eight fighter-bombers.Liberators bombed the airfields at Viterbo, Orvieto and Tarquinia (45 miles .W. of Rome). Hits were obtained on hangars and at least 17 aircraft on theground were destroyed or damaged. In the north of Italy 38 Wellingtons madea night attack on the railway centre at Padua where the main yard and sidingswere hit and 75 railway waggons destroyed or damaged. The railway centresat Verona, Siena and Prato were also successfully attacked.. Bad weather limited the enemy fighter-bomber operations and prohibitedlong-range bomber operations against the . bridgehead. On the 6th, however,when weather conditions improved some 200 enemy sorties were flown over theNettuno and Cassino fronts.The total number of sorties flown during the week by the MediterraneanAllied Air Force was 6,253. Battle casualties were 46 enemy aircraft destroyed for the loss of 33 Allied aircraft.South France.45. A force of 72 Fortresses bombed Toulon in unfavourable weather conditions. Scattered hits were obtained on harbour installations, the coal depot,arsenal and stores; a direct hit was also reported on the hull of an old battleshipand on a ship of 400 feet, and hits or near misses were made on two cruisers anda submarine.Yugoslavia and Albania.46. A force of 25 Wellingtons bombed an aircraft factory at Maribor; theresults are believed to have been good and hits were obtained on the workshop and administrative buildings. Spitfires damaged M.T. and rolling-stock at Ploca(60 miles S.E. of Split).A radar station at Durazzo was bombed by 41 Liberators and 50-100 bursts were observed in the fargetGreece and iEgean.47. Attacks on enemy supply ships&quot; and harbours were continued.Wellingtons obtained four hits on a Large ship north of Patmos which was leftburning fiercely and Beaufighters damaged one of the escort vessels; a ship of1,000 tons was set on fire. At least 14 caiques were destroyed or seriously damaged.  Eight of our aircraft are missing.Russia.48. The unusually mild weather conditions resulting in muddy ground andunserviceable airfields, continued to prevail and hampered air activity as a whole.There are indications, however, that the Russian Air Force was engaged in close-support operations whenever possible on all sectors. On the 2nd February theRussians are reported to have raided, in large forces, enemy advance bases west
of Novosokolniki, destroying 150 M/T as well as a number of tanks, guns,ammunition and fuel dumps&quot; On the southern front, in the encirclement area ofZvenigorodko and Shpola, the Russians concentrated their attacks on enemytransport planes and claim to have destroyed over 100 of them in the air andon the ground during the three days from the 3rd to the 5th February inclusive.On the night of the 6th February large formations of Russian bombers (four of which are stated to be missing) raided Helsinki. The Finns state that mostof the damage was done in the suburbs and outskirts.The day-by-day claims for the week of German aircraft shot down by fighter and A. A. defences are higher than those of the preceding week and amount to313 aircraft.No appreciable German air opposition wras offered to the Russian advanceinto Central Poland. Against the Russian advance west of Leningrad it isthought that some air reinforcements may have been brought up from South and central Russia. Even so. the forces available on this front, estimated at about250 first-line aircraft, are totally inadequate for the tasks facing them.Burma.49. In the North, fighter bombers attacked Myitkyina airfield and itssatellite, and also bombed enemy camps and concentrations in the Mogaung area.In the Upper Chindwin and in the Mayu Peninsula area, similar aircraft, ofwhich about 220 operated, made a number of harassing raids on enemy positions and other objectives.In Central Burma, a total of 120 heavy and medium bombers made sevenattacks on the airfields at Heho and Aungban, both about 100 miles S.S.E. of Mandalay.Attacks on enemy communications resulted in the destruction of or damage to 66 river craft and damage to 20 locomotives and 87 units of rolling stock.Enemy activity was restricted to three fighter sweeps, each consisting of about50 aircraft, over the Mayu Peninsula area.China.50. On the 5th, allied aircraft sank six small ships, out of a convoy of nine,between Hongkong and Swatow.Siam.51. On the night of the .5th/6th, 11 Liberators bombed an ordnance plant at Bangkok.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.52. Successful attacks were made on four airfields near Wewak by a total of161 escorted heavy and medium bombers; 86 enemy aircraft are claimed destroyedeither in combat or on the ground. An effective raid was made on Marienberg(50 miles S.E. of Wewak) by 23 escorted Bostons.In the Madang area, buildings and enemy positions were attacked by89 medium and light bombers, and dumps near Alexishafen ah-field by 65 aircraft.Off the coast, two ships, a probable gunboat and nine barges were sunk, anda further six barges were sunk in the Ramu river.New Britain.53. Airfields near Rabaul were attacked on eight occasions by a total of254 escorted aircraft; 38 enemy aircraft were destroyed and many others damaged for the loss of 13 allied aircraft.Liberators, unable to reach their primary target of Kavieng owing toweather, dropped 149 tons of bombs on the airfield at Cape Hoskins.Bismarck Archipelago.54. On the night of the 2nd/3rd, Catalinas set on fire a medium sized cargo ship west of New Hanover and, on the following day, Mitchells set on fire afreighter in the same area.On the 6th, Momote airfield (Admiralty Islands) was bombed by 25 escortedLiberators.
THE MARSHALL ISLANDS.55. It is now officially confirmed that the U.S. assault was made onKwajalein Atoll on the 31st January. It was preceded by a combined naval andair bombardment which pulverised the Japanese defences and made landingscomparatively easy. It is estimated that the Navy expended about 14,000 tonsof shells. In the attacks by carrier-borne aircraft on the Roi and Namur airfieldson Kwajalein Atoll, about 75 enemy aircraft were destroyed, either on the groundor in the air, for the loss of nine allied aircraft. Subsidiary raids were madeon the airfields on Wotje, Maleolap and Milli Atolls. The landings were madeby two separate forces. The northern force, after having&apos; taken Roi Island onthe 1st February, occupied the closely adjacent Namur Island oil the following-day. The southern force, which had landed at the western end of KwajaleinIsland on the 1st, had succeeded in killing more than half the Japanese garrisonby the 3rd and that night was in complete occupation of the island. Theoperations concluded with the successful mopping up of such of the remainingislands of the Kwajalein Atoll as contained Japanese establishments, and it was announced on the 8th that organised Japanese resistance had ceased and that the capture and occupation of Kwajalein Atoll had been completed. The enemyappears to have been taken completely by surprise and the force at Kwajalein put up less resistance than was expected, probably owing to the intensity of thepreliminary bombardment. Over 8,000 of the enemy were killed and under300 U.S. troops.56. On the 31st U.S. troops also occupied Majuro Atoll, about 250 miles south-east of Kwajalein, which has a good deep-water anchorage.57. The U.S. destroyer Burns, operating in the Marshall Islands area on the31st January, shelled and sank a Japanese convoy consisting of one tanker, onemedium-sized cargo ship and two smaller ships.(An outline map is included as an inset.)HOME SEGURITY SITUATION.GeneraL58.
