THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.35SECRET.Copy No.  25W.P. (44) 59.21th January, 1944.WAR CABINET.SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS FOR &quot; OVERLORD.Report by the Minister of Information.AT a meeting of the Cabinet on the 24th January reference was made(W.M. (44) 10th Conclusions, Item 4) to an article in the Daily Mail which hadnot been submitted for censorship. The article was by Colin Bednall, the newspapers regular Air Correspondent, and appeared in the paper of Wednesday,the 19th January. It was thus published before the Confidential Letter fromthe Ministry of Information to newspaper editors about operational speculationshad been circulated.2. The purport of the article was to draw attention to the fact that the appointments in connection with &quot; Overlord &quot; already announced had not made it plain what role the R.A.F. Bomber Command was to play in the strategy of&quot; Overlord,&quot; and what the relations were to be between Air Chief Marshal Harrisand General Eisenhower.3. The article was devoted to the posing of this question and, except forone speculation as to the respective roles of Air Chief Marshal Harris and GeneralSpaatz, did not attempt to supply the answers. Although it is obviouslyundesirable, in these circumstances, that questions of this sort should have public attention called to them and should be debated, such an article is only on theborderline of censorable material, and it would be difficult to say that it reallygave any information away.4. Now that the Censorship request about speculation has gone out tothe papers, we take the view that articles of this sort are effectively banned forthe future; but to avoid the possibility of any misunderstanding a letter is beingwritten to the editor of the Daily Mail calling his attention to Colin Bednallsarticles and stating specifically that it is the kind of thing that the Governmentdesires to eliminate for the future.B. B.Ministry of Information,27th Janivary, 1944.[26796]
