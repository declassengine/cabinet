(44) 97.%th February, 1944.WAR CABINET.REALLOCATION OF MAN-POWER DURING THE transition period BETWEEN THE END OF THE WAR IN EUROPE ANDTHE END OF THE WAR IN JAPAN.Position of the Regular Police serving with the Forces.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and the Secretary of State for Scotland.1. The proposals made by the Minister of Labour and National Service(W.P. (44) 71) make no specific provision for the release of the regular policeserving with the Armed Forces, although the report of the Jowitt Committee(W.P. (43) 494) called the special attention of the War Cabinet to the police service and pointed out that the claim for the return of policemen from theFighting Services as soon as possible after the termination of hostilities in europe was not challenged by the Service Departments, who regard the transfer of menfrom one disciplined service to their old posts in another as resting on quite adifferent footing from other categories (paragraph 33 of the Report of the JowittCommittee).2. We cannot contend that every policeman is a &quot;specialist&quot; who Wouldqualify for early release on an individual basis as proposed in paragraph 10 of w.P. (44) 71, but we do urge that the police service as a whole is a &quot; specialist &quot;service in which every individual counts. That service has been so depleted thatit is, in our view, essential that every available regular policeman who is noturgently required for operational duties in the Armed Forces should be reallocatedto his civil duties at the earliest possible moment after the termination ofhostilities in Europe.3.   The reasons for our view may be summarised as follows :  (1) The pre-war strength of the regular-police in Great Britain was 71,000.This has been reduced during, the war by 22,000, or over 30 per cent.Of these 22,000 some 15,000 are in the Armed Forces, the remainingloss being due to wastage of various kinds.(2) The regular police have lost not only numbers but quality. The majorityof those released to the Forces are under 30 years of age. The service,as a result, now contains an undue proportion of older men, many ofwhom would have retired but for the war. This loss in quality will,in the nature of things, increase progressively as the war continues,with a consequential loss of police efficiency.(3) If the &quot; age and length of service&quot; basis is applied to the police, it is unlikely that more than some 2,000 or 3,000 would qualify for early release since only the younger men have, in the main, been allowed tojoin the Armed Forces and many of them will have had comparatively short military service.[26904]Copy No.
(4) It is important from the point of view of the maintenance of law andorder that at the end of hostilities in Europe there should beavailable in this country an adequate number of regular policemenwho have been trained to, and are accustomed to, deal with the civilpopulation. After the defeat of Germany there may well be in thiscountry social and industrial troubles calling for the utmost tact andforbearance on the part of the civil authorities, and in particular ofthe police. The regular police are accustomed to deal skilfully andtactfully with the public, and are thus not only a potent factor inthe prevention of disorder but are also much more likely to keep any public manifestations of unrest within reasonable dimensions thana far larger number of inexperienced and unskilled auxiliaries. Themaintenance of law and order is, of course, a condition precedent tothe fulfilment of our reconstruction plans, including those for the orderly demobilisation of the Armed Forces.(5) Of the 15,000 regular police in the forces, some 4,000 are air crews in theR.A.F., over 2,000 are in the Navy and the remaining 9,000 are in theArmy. The man-power requirements of the different FightingSeiwices will no doubt vary in the interval between the termination ofhostilities in Europe and the end of the war with Japan, but our view is that, on the termination of the war in Europe, the police service should have the prior claim on those regular policemen who are notneeded as actual combatants in the war against Japan.(6) For war purposes the regular police have been supplemented byauxiliaries, who now number some 27,000 but will shortly be reducedto 18,000, mostly over the age of 35 years. The majority of these18,000 are anxious to be demobilised as soon as possible after thewar in Europe is over. If they are retained compulsorily they willbe an uncertain asset and may be a source of embarrassment ratherthan of strength to those responsible for law and order. Moreover,it cannot be expected that, man for man, the auxiliaries are effectivesubstitutes for the regular police. If the regular police, supplemented by such auxiliaries as remain, prove insufficient to deal with civilunrest, there would&apos; be no alternative but to call on the military in aid of the civil power. We do not say that there will be such unrest,but that there may be and that we must be prepared.(7) The serious deficiency in the post-war strength of the regular policecannot be met by wholesale recruitment. In order to recruit into thepolice service the best available candidates from among the ex-servicemen, recruitment should be spread over a substantial period; other-wise an opportunity to join the police service would be denied to the younger men now serving with the Armed Forces. Moreover, all newrecruits will require to have an adequate period of training before they will be capable of dealing with the difficulties of the post-war situation.(8) The police service is already showing signs of overstrain. TheCommissioner of Police of the Metropolis and Chief Constablesgenerally are unanimous in representing that they will be unable to cope with the problems which they foresee unless they can rely uponthe return of regulars at the earliest date.4. We submit that the foregoing considerations fully justify us in asking that all regular policemen not required for military operations outside europe should be reallocated to their civilian duties at least as early as the men in class B and the specialists referred to in the Scheme of the Ministry of Labourand National Service. As the Jowitt Committee point out, the return of theregular police to their duties at an early date would not be regarded asinequitable by the Forces, and we think that it would be regarded by the publicnot as a privilege accorded to the police so that they might seize all the bestopportunities in civil life, but as a transfer from one disciplined service toanother.We think that our proposals as regards the regular police are wholly in keeping with the principles laid down by the Jowitt Committee and reproduced in paragraph 2 of W.P. (44) 71.H. M.T. J.Home Office, 9th February, 1944. &apos; ,
