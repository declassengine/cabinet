(45) 95.13th February, 1945.WAR CABINET.COAL SUPPLIES FOR OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTSAFTER 30th APRIL, 1945.Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power.I give below an exchange of minutes between the Prime Minister and myselfabout the supply.of coal to S.H.A.E.F. and the Mediterranean area for the period the 1st May-31st August, 1945. In accordance with the Prime Minister&apos;sminute I now seek the agreement of the War Cabinet to the proposals made inmy own minute of the 9th February.G. Ll. G.Ministry of Fuel and Power,7, MUlbank, S.W.1,13th February, 1945.7*2**Minute from the Minister of Fuel and Power to the Prime Minister.You asked me not to enter into any new commitments for the supply of coal to S.H.A.E.F. after the 30th April, 1945. I am now being pressed by washington to inform them of the availability of United Kingdom coal for the period the1st May-31st August, 1945.2. For this period the demand for S.H.A.E.F. is for about 1 million tons.In addition 280,000 tons per month will be required by S.H.A.E.F. for norway and Denmark from a date to be determined.3. If stocks in the United Kingdom are to be built up by the31st October, 1945, to the level of 17% million tons reached at the 31st October,1944 (which I regard as the bare minimum), the United Kingdom can only meetthe demand during the period the 1st May-31st August for 450,000 tons of very low grade coals.4. We shall, therefore, have to ask the United States to take over responsibility for the balance of S.H.A.E.F. and Mediterranean requirements.These will amount to 200,000 tons per month, plus all supplies required forNorway and Denmark, over and above the tonnages the United States are atpresent supplying. This transfer of responsibility will, of course, have seriousshipping implications.5.   May I inform Washington accordingly?G. Ll. G.9th February, 1945.II.Minute from the Prime Minister to the Minister of Fuel and Power.Your paragraph 5.  Yes, provided the Cabinet agree.w. s. c.[29225]
