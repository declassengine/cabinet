(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S E0 R E copy NO.WAR CABINETMINIMUM STOCKS OF PRINCIPAL IMPORTED FOODS-&quot;  &apos; Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of food.      The review of the United&apos;Kingdom food stock position which, as approved by the Lord President&apos;s Committee(L.P.(45)  2nd Meeting), my department has been undertaking in association with the American Mission for Economic affairs is now complete and is circulated as Exhibit I to thismemorandum.      I am glad to say that v/e have been able toreach full agreement with the Americans as to the minimum&apos;necessary stock levels.2.      These minimum levels are shown in Appendix I of Exhibit Iand are those which it is necessary to hold in the UnitedKingdom to ensure maintenance of current consumption under present conditions of transport, labour and distribution.For certain foods the figures provide for additional reserves to cover the vulnerability of processing plant to air attack and other contingencies.      These are set out separately...in,column B of Appendix I to the report.3. I am not prepared to see my stocks fall below these levels and in several instances, in view of the doubtfulprospect of future supplies,  I cannot at present agree tobring my stocks down to them. ....... The desirability of maintainingstocks above the agreed minima is accepted by the Americans andis mentioned In paragraph 2 of the report.4,      To maintain the same margin over minimum stocks as existedat end December 1944 we should nee&apos;d total food imports of6.4 million tons during the first half of 1945.      This compares with our actual import-programme of 6.2 million tons.      Ihave, therefore,  already accepted a reduction of 200,000 tonsin the margin in my stocks-.5.      In Exhibit II annexed are shown in respect of each ofthe principal imported foods:(a) The margin in stocks at end December 1944.(b) The estimated margin in stocks at end June 1945on the basis of imports of. 6.2 million tons during January to June 19*45.

The proposed further saving set out in Exhibit II(370,000 tons - see footnote (b)) can,  in my opinion,be made as a final contribution towards meeting theshortage of shipping;    it is in addition to the cut of 200,000 tons mentioned in paragraph 4 above.(Intlti,)    J,J.

EXHIBIT I

MINIMUM U.K. STOCKS OF PRINCIPAL FOODS

JOINT REPORT BY MINISTRY OF FOOD AND MISSION FOR ECONOMIC AFFAIRS LONDON DATED 19TH JANUARY 1945

1. The object of this enquiry, carried out jointly by representatives of the Ministry of Food and MEA, has been to determine for each principal imported foodstuff, the minimum stocks which it is necessary to hold in the U.K. to ensure the maintenance of current consumption rates under present-day conditions of transport, labour and distribution. Stocks were jointly analysed on the basis of the Ministry&apos;s experience during the war years, and the reasons for the various minimum levels suggested by the Ministry were examined. On the basis of this analysis and explanation, the MEA representatives are agreed that the estimates suggested by the Ministry and set forth in Appendix I, are reasonable

2. Although this report establishes levels to which it would be possible to allow stocks to fall, if necessary, the prudence of maintaining higher stocks in the U.K. is to be emphasised. The production of foods within the U.K. is inadequate to maintain its population who are greatly dependent upon imported foods. The U.K. stocks of food are consequently dependent upon the shipping available for their import. Higher stocks permit greater flexibility in shipping arrangements and provide some measure of protection against contingencies.

3. The investigation covered all stocks of the commodities concerned other than those in the hands of retailers. The stocks investigated comprise:

(a) stocks owned or controlled by the Ministry of Food ("Bulk" stocks);

(b) stocks in the hands of manufacturers, wholesalers, etc. in the case of those foods released by the Ministry earlier than the retail stage. ("Supplementary" stocks)

No up to date information is available is to the precise quantity stocks held by retailers but all evidence points to the conclusion that these stocks are materially less than pre-war. They represent for practical purposes, a necessary extension of the "pipeline" and are working stocks which do not certain any significant element of additional reserves.

4. In order to assess minimum stock levels it is necessary to make some assumption regarding shipping availability and war developments, subsequent to the date when such minima are reached in the event of it becoming necessary to plan for the deliberate reduction of stocks to minimum levels. In this investigation was assumed:

(a) That no specific date for the end of the war in Europe could be forecast.

(b). That  subsequent imports,  ever a&apos; period of say sixmonths,- would not be less than the quantity of f*odallocated by the C.F.B., but that in addition towartime irregularities *f arrivals,- there would bethe possibility of a short term shipping stringencywhich might preclude the import in any particularmonth cr so of the precise quantity programmed foreach cornmodity.(c) That no major strategic reverse was te be expected inthe war in Europe btct that damage to processing plantby air attack was still a possibility.5S      It was found that the minimum distribution stock required vari-efrom commodity to commodity,.      Thus while stocks of about 13 weekssupply wore generally found to be required, less cover is necessaryfor perishable foods,  such as meat, where the distribution chain is small and the food is consumed in the form in which it is imported.Ocnversely a larger stack is required when processing of any sortis necessary and the commodity passes through several hands.      The-fallowing are the principal factors considered in determining theminimum distribution levels:(a) the interval, under existing ration schemes, between, -each allocation made by the Ministry to wholesalers;(b) the number of links, in the distribution chain beforethe commodity reaches the retailer;(c) the quantity discharging from ship and in transit;(d) the extent of reconditioning or processing necessary;(e) the irregularity of arrivals, which is Influenced by thelength of voyage,  convey arrangements, port assignmentsand other war-time shipping conditions;(f) the seasonal nature of the supply of certain rOoods.   -6,      The minimum tunnages required to ensure the maintenance of current consumption levels are shown in Appendix I.      in Claim A&quot;pipe-line&quot; stocks are included, plus a margin to cover the nowcustomary war-time irregularities of arrivals (i, e,  a small reserve to ensure thatthe &quot;pipe-line&quot; remains full).      It does not follow that distribution breaks down immediately stocks are below these levels.      They are,  hwwever, the levels at which a continuance of consumption rates is jeopardised and the future supply position mustbe constantly surveyed in order to plan in advance either extra-crdinary measures to maintain consumption or a reduction in rations.By adopting special measures it has recently been possible tomaintain the bacon and butter rations with lower stocks thannormal &quot;pipe-line&quot;  levels.      When this happened bacon was virtuallybeing delivered direct from    ship to shop and particular vesselscarrying butter to the TJ.K^  had to be speeded up to maintaincontinuity of supplies.     Whilst such measures can at times beadopted for individual foods, in present conditions of inland transport,  labour,  etc.  it would be impossible to take&apos;such actionover a range of different commodities at the same time.7.      Column B of Appendix I shows certain additional reservesrequired to cover the vulnerability of px^ocessing plant to ai:attack and other contingencies specified belvw:-(a)    Wheat and Fieur.      A  special reserve is necessary sinceany material c hange    in the volume of shipping availablefor food imports is likely to bo reflected in the WorthAmerican range and therefore to have an immediate effect

upon the stocks of wheat and flour.      Imports ofwheat and flour in i9h-h were about three times greaterthan those of all other foods carried in non-refrigeratedspa6e from the N. American continent,     A further reserve,specifically in -the form of flour, is necessary as a safe guard against a loss of flour milling capacity throughenemy air attack.      Bread is the principal unrationedstaple food consumed in the U,K.      It is therefore thebuffer which reflects any changes in available suppliesof ether commodities.      For example it is expected&apos;that present potato supplies will be inadequate to meetconsumption requirements until the new crop is availablein July and this will result in increased bread consumption.Against the above contingencies it is considered necessaryto hold in the U.K.  300,000 tons ef wheat  and 300,000 toasof flour,  in total slightly,over 3 weeks&apos;  consumption,(b) pulses.        Aljout 60,000 tons of dried green peas areconsumed annually and it is aimed to produce this quantityat home.      It is however necessary to hold a reserve of about 10,000 tons of imported green peas to supplementhome produced supplies in the event of a partial failureef the home crop,,      This quantity,  if needed, would ?*erequired in the U,k1 from April onwards to meet consumptienrequirements until new crop supplies again become available iSeptember.      The position could be protected at other timesby ah assurance that the quantity could be obtained from overseas if-and when it was required,(c) Oils and Fats.      Increased oilseed production overseas hsvbeen encouraged and UJi,. stocks have been built up withoutincrease in consumption because of the prospect of inadequacy of supplies,  s&amp; long as Japan remains undefeated, to meet allrequirements including thuse cf liberated Europe,      Asubstantial deficiency is expected this year and the DYK.is already planning a reduction in stocks.      It will be appreciated however that the supplies for 1 9h5 cannot beforecast with certainty until considerably later in the year.Thus apart from the uncertainty that future butter supplies will oe available to maintain the 2 oz,  ration,  it Isnecessary to held some /reserve against the uncertainty of,future supplies of fats generally.      It is also necessaryto provide for dislocations which   would follow fromdestruction by air attack of important processing units.Even a short term shipping &quot;squeeze&quot; in areas from whichcilseeds are drawn would endanger the &quot;pipe-line&quot;&apos; stocks,A reserve of 100,000 tons in terms of fat is made for these purposes - the equivalent of about one month&apos;sconsumption^(d) sugar .      90,000 tons,  slightly less than 3 weeks&apos;  con-sumpti*n, are required as a protection against damage by air attack to beet sugar factories and refineries,(e) Canned Corned Meat.      A reserve of 90P000 tons isrequireol maThly as a  safeguard against possible shortages ofother types of meat  and protein foods.      The minimum stocklevels of carcase meat, points canned meat,  canned fish and cheese include no resovve- against future supply or shipping difficulties and all are  in oUox-t supply.      It has beenmecessary in the past  to issue Inc.leased quantities ofbanned meat en the Paints ration to offset partly areduction in the cheese -ration below the current level and tissue canned corned meat against the weekly ration of 11+d.-worth ^f carcase meat.      In 1943 the latter ration was

only maintained by releasing in this way 67.1+00 tonsof corned meat.(f) Evaporated MIlk       1+0,000 tons are held in the U.K. ,*, spread ever The country, in order to supplement liquid milk supplies during the winter months if they fall tosuch an extent that it would not be possible to-provide 2 pints   per week to the civilian adult consumer.Should it become vitally necessary,  it would bepossible to permit some reduction in this stock duringthe summer months (April to September) provided adequate-assurances could be given that it would be replaced by the early autumn,(g) Jam and Marmalade.      Stocks (20,000 tons) are held byTEe Ministry only to make good any short-fall in home production,8*     Attention is drawn to the fact; that in the discussions regardinCP.B,  allocations for flour, fats, meat and sugar a lower stocklevel is envisaged at end 19U5 than in this Report.      This is not inconsistent since,  even if not explicit, the C.F.B.  allocationdiscussions assume that the war in Europe will be over before theend of 191+5?. which would make possible a downward revision of theminimum stock levels.      The minimum levels in this Report are applicable to the present period of hostilities with all theattendant risks.      Thus although related- to no specific date, theyare framed bearing in mind the possibility that, mainly for shipping reasons, it may become necessary to reduce stocks tominimum levels by end June 194-5.9.      In Appendix II the minimum levels are compared with actualU.K.  stocks at end December 19hlu19th January, 191+5,

NOTES ON APPENDIX Ia) The minimum distribution level represents pipe linestocks plus a small reserve against customary war-timeirregularity of arrivals.- / .b) Minimum supplementary stocks vary from time to lime for some commodities but a reasonable average has been adopted forthis Report.*c) The minimum distribution level of bulk stocks of wheat is greater by 260,000 tons than the corresponding estimate madein the Joint Report of February, 1944.      This results froma re-examination of the details which disclose thatinadequate allowance was made previously for the quantityof imported wheat which is necessary to maintain inconstant operation, the principal flour mills.d) The ,&quot;Bulk&quot; and &quot;Total&quot; stocks of maize include 30,000 tons .for human consumption and industrial-purposes (e.g. starch-manufacture).e) The &quot;Bulk&quot; and &quot;Total&quot; stocks  of starch include 8,000 tons(the present quantity) of tapioca starch and otherirreplaceable starches which are allocated only for those purposes for which they are essential,      This part of theminimum stock will therefore decline,  at the present rateof usage by about 800 tons per month.f) Given adequate assurances as to replacement, it would bepossible to permit some reduction during the summer monthsof the additional reserve of evaporated milk (see para 7(f)of the Report) .g) A larger minimum stock of dried milk will be necessary ifincorporation in flour milling is resumed.is)    Includes a minimum of 9,000 tons dried eggs in consumerpack and 11,670 tons in bulk for issue to bakers etc. &apos;j)    The minimum figures for fruit pulp and jam assume that areasonable assortment of varieties is maintained.

This also provides for the building up of essential working stocks to 150,000 tons plus aninsignificant margin of 17,000 tons.Stocks are now below minimum and are not expected to increase.Stocksend-of June, 1945 are forecast to fall below minimum.Supply prospects are bad and it. is necessary to maintain stocksas high, as possible in order to afford security to the presentation.    If, however, some reduction in imports is essential, adecrease in stocks of oils and fats is possible.    This could onlybe achieved by reducing loadings in India -and West Africa,relatively easy shipping routes.Supply prospects are bad and it is probable that on supply grounds imports in 1945 will not be sufficient to maintainminimum stock levels at the end of the year.    It is possible,therefore, to face a reduction to ..-the ininimura level by 30 th June,1945 provided adequate imports are, assured in the second half ofthe year.Starch is obtained mainly from the U.S.A. under Lend/Lease,   Ifthe quantities allocated to the United Kingdom within the fiscalyear 1944/45&apos; are not lifted it is probable that the War PoodAdministration will decrease its purchases, and domestic consumption within the U. S.A. will increase..   Apart from this areduction of stocks to nearer the minimum level would be possible.Carried in refrigerated tonnage.    Supply prospects are exceedinglydoubtful.    Drought in Australia.is estimated to reduce suppl5.es in1945 by 100,000 tons below 1944.    In the absence of a contract with argentina the continuity of supplies from that source is notassured.    In order to safeguard the present ration we must take all meat allocated to us when it is offered.Maximum stocks are necessary in order to maintain a reserveagainst the possibility of a deficiency of carcase meat.Provision is made-for&apos; imports &apos;during January/June of only 26,000tons and owing to the present uncertainty of supplies fromArgentina, it is desirable to lift the maximum quantities thatare available from all sources.   Furthermore we may continue toexperience calls upon our stocks to meet urgent demands fromother consumers.
