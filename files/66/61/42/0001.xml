THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC Mil JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 87.12th February, 1945.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER IN THE FIRST HALF OF 1945.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.AT their meeting on the 25th January, the War Cabinet agreed that &apos;&apos; forpurposes of planning production it should be assumed that the earliest date onwhich the German war was likely to end was the 30th June, 1945, and thedate beyond which it was unlikely to continue, the 1st November, 1945 &quot;(W.M. (45) 9th Conclusions, Minute 1). The War Cabinet also approved the january aircraft programme set out in W.P. (45) 32, subject to any adjustmentsrequired to meet the increased need for short-range high performance fighters inthe event of the extension of the German war beyond the 30th June, and to make up any deficiency in the supply of Corsair aircraft from the United States.2. The Minister of Aircraft Production estimates that the effect of these decisions upon the labour requirements of the aircraft programme is to increasethe labour force required at the 30th June, 1945, by 100,000 workers, from1,140,000 (the provisional estimate given in W.P. (45) 32) to 1,240,000. TheAdmiralty also asks for an increase of 5,000 in their end-1944 allocated industrialstrength, which previously they were prepared to accept unchanged as the requirement for the 30th June, 1945.3. The Ministerial Committee on Man-power have examined the effect upon other man-power programmes of these revised requirements. Whereas on theoriginal estimates of the numbers which could be released from the munitions industries in the first half of 1945, it would have been possible to allocate toall other industries and services nett increases totalling 315,000 workers, the revised requirements of MA.P. and the Admiralty will reduce the total availablefor allocation to only 210,000. As the requirements put forward for these otherindustries and services total over 532,000, it would in any event be necessaryto impose severe cuts. The big reduction in the total available for allocation is,however, particularly serious for the industries and services for which the Boardof Trade are responsible. The Board of Trade ask for-375,000 additional workersin the first half of 1945 in order to meet certain essential civilian needs (includingtextiles, clothing and furniture), to produce housing fittings, to make a start withthe re-equipment of industry, and to restore some of the export trade. against this, their share of the total of 210,000 workers available for allocation to all departments could not be more than about 85,000 workers. This allocation wouldbe quite inadequate to meet even the most urgent needs, and would undoubtedlygive rise to grave difficulties.4. A further consequence of the revised requirements of M.A.P. and theAdmiralty will be that the Minister of Labour and National Service will find itimpossible to meet in full the intakes to the Armed Forces for the first six[29205]
months of 1945 already approved by the War Cabinet (W.M. (44) 173rd Con-clusions, Minute 3). These intakes were fixed in the expectation that 20,000 youngmen could be called up from the munitions industries. This figure will be reduced if the new requirements of M.A.P. are to be met, and the deficiency might beabout 5,000 men.5. The implications for man-power programmes are thus so serious that the ministerial Committee have reached the conclusion that the War Cabinet shouldhave an opportunity of reconsidering the whole matter, including the strategicaspects involved. -J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,-  Hth February, 1945.
