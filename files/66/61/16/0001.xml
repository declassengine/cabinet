S/M Seascout damaged twocoasters which were forced to beach.H.M. S/M Porpoise is overdue from patrol in the Malacca Strait and mustbe presumed lost.
Pacific.13. At Leyte U.S. coastal craft sank three enemy barges, and on the night of the 14th/15th an unopposed landing was effected at Ponson Island (S. ofOrmoc).During the week a number of enemy warships, cargo ships and sea truckshave been sighted by aircraft off Formosa and the islands to the north-east.Anti-Submarine Operations.14. Sixteen attacks were reported during the week, of which 14 were by warships and two by shore-based aircraft.On the 21st H.M.S.

Activity continues in Home Waters, particularly in the Irish Sea, butelsewhere the situation is quiet.Enemy Attack on Shipping.16. During the week two small ships were sunk in the Irish Sea probably by U-boats and a U.S. ship, in a coastal convoy, was torpedoed off Lands End butreached port.Two ships were sunk by mines, off Zeebrugge and the Humber respectively.One ship was sunk by E-boats off Dunkirk and another ship was sunk by aircraft in Antwerp docks.Allied Minelaying.17.   Surface craft have laid mines in Home Waters.One of H.M. submarines laid mines in the Malacca Strait and aircraftlaid mines off the Burmese and Malayan coasts and in the Gulf of Siam.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Mines weeping.18. Enemy aircraft probably laid mines in the Scheldt approaches on one night, and E-boats may have laid mines in the Scheldt approaches, on the convoyroute to Ostend and off the Humber on three nights of the week. Ten mines havebeen destroyed off Boulogne. Since the landing in Normandy over 2,000 mines have been destroyed in the Channel and adjacent waters.During the week 29 mines have been destroyed in the south Corfu Channel. ^Up to the present 66 mines have been destroyed in the Dardanellesapproaches.The mine totals are 6,272 ground and 8,489 moored.-Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.19. From the 16th to 31st December enemy shipping losses through allied action amounted to eight ships of 26,818 tons; in addition ten ships of23,600 tons were damaged. &quot;During the whole month 16 ships of 41,775 tons were lost and 22 ships of 46,672 tons were damaged.It is reported that operations off the Norwegian coast have caused extremedisorganisation to enemy shipping. Orkla, Germany&apos;s second largest source of pyrites, is reported to be reducing its output owing to lack of shipping. Thisalso affects the enemy&apos;s supply of sulphuric acid.J apanese.20.   Up to December 1944 Japanese losses from Allied action were estimatedat 6,132,000 tons leaving no more than 2,913,000 tons serviceable.[29119] B
MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.21. The enemy has shifted the main weight of his offensive effort to the areanorth of Strasbourg, where the Seventh U.S. Army has withdrawn to betterdefensive positions, but so far there has been no concentrated enemy attack. \In the Ardennes, the Third and First U.S. Armies are following hard on theheels of the Germans, who, although they are withdrawing the main body of their troops, continue to fight fiercely.The British attack north of Sittard has made steady progress under adverse weather conditions.Southern Sector.22. On the 20th, the First French Army put in an attack northwards betweenMulhouse and Thann; after an initial advance of half a mile, the enemy&apos;sresistance stiffened. Violent fighting is now in progress in this area, A furthersmall attack was launched north of Colmar on the 23rd--large minefields were encountered and little progress has been made.On the 19th, the U.S. force containing the German bridgehead across the rhine north of Strasbourg made a voluntary withdrawal to defensive positionssome 3 miles further west. This withdrawal enabled the enemy to link up hisbridgehead with his main forces pressing from the north, but on the 21st the wholeright flank of the Seventh U.S. Army fell back deliberately to a line runningN.W. from Haguenau towards Bitohe.Central Sector.23. .* The Third and First U.S. Armies have made steady progress along thewhole of the Ardennes front. Enemy resistance has been more stubborn on thesouthern flank in the area of Diekirch and at some points in the centre, east ofHouffalize, but widespread minefields and deep snow have been the main obstacles to Allied progress. On the 23rd, U.S. Armoured columns re-entered St. Vithunopposed, though reports indicate that the Germans are counter-attacking inthis area.  On the following day, U.S. troops entered Clervaux, again unopposed.Northern Sector.24. The Second British Army went over to the offensive on the 18th whenthey attacked the German salient in the area between Julich and Roermond.Steady progress has been made against stubborn resistance and, in spite ofextremely bad going which has prevented much movement off the roads, our troops are now within 2-3 miles of the River Roer, and have entered Ffeinsberg.Eastern Europe.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.25. The Russian winter offensive which opened on the 12th with an attackS.W. of Sandomierz and which was developed on the 14th by attacks all along the 450 mile front between East Prussia and Southern Slovakia, had by the 23rdmade deep penetrations into East Prussia from two directions, advancedhalf-way from Warsaw to Berlin, and reached the line of the River Oder on a35 mile front S.E. of Breslau.East Prussia. ......26. The direct attack on East Prussia from the east has made most progressnorth of and along the Kovno-Insterburg railway. After five days&apos; fighting theRussians broke through strong German permanent defences, captured the townsof Tilsit (20th) and Insterburg (22nd) and by the 23rd were only 25-30 miles tothe N.Ji. and east of Kdnigsberg.Pressure has been kept up along the rest of the East Prussian border to thesouth and the Russians have made some advance, but the Germans claim to beholding firm in this area along the line of the Masurian Lakes.To the S.W. the Russian outflanking drive towards Danzig crossed thefrontier into East Prussia on the 20th.   Two days later Soviet forces captured
Allenstein, thereby cutting the main railway from Berlin to Insterburg and bythe 23rd, advancing in the direction of Eloing, they had narrowed the escapecorridor for the German forces in East Prussia to 20 miles.Central Sector.27. The capture of Warsaw on the 17th was achieved by an encircling movecarried out by forces advancing across the Vistula, north and south of thecapital. Then, moving forward on a broad front south of the Vistula, theRussians pushed due west on the shortest route to Berlin capturing Lodz on the19th. and Gniezno on the 22nd. Other forces swinging N.W. by-passed the fortress of to run on the Vistula and captured Bromberg 30 miles N.W. of Torunon 23rd.In southern Poland a rapid advance in the first few days of the offensivecarried the Russians to Czestochowa. By the 19th they had crossed the german frontier N.W. of Czestochowa and further to the S.E. the capture of Cracowbrought- them close to the Silesian industrial area. The former thrust has nowcarried them across the main Breslau-Katowice railway up to the River Oder,which they have reached on a 35-mile front S.E. of Breslau. German resistancealong the northern edge of Upper Silesia now seems to have stiffened.In the extreme south of Poland and in Czechoslovakia the Russians have advanced 50-60 miles and captured on the 20th the three railway, junctions ofNowysacz, Presov and Kosice. It is possible that the Germans are withdrawingsome of their forces from this mountainous area for employment in morethreatened sectors.Southern Sector.28. The German counter-attack from the N.W. towards Budapest has apparently been abandoned but a new attempt to relieve the capital from the S.W.has had some success. Attacking from just north of Lake Balaton, the Germansclaim to have reached the Danube south of Budapest. The Russians admit theloss of Szekesfehervar, on the 23rd.Italy.29.   Nothing to report.Yugoslavia.30. In N.E. Yugoslavia the Germans claim to have recaptured the town ofSid (65 miles N.W. of Belgrade).Greece.31. E.L.A.S. leaders have complied with the terms of the truce, which came into force on the 15th and no incidents have occurred during their withdrawal to the areas demarcated in the agreement.Burma.32. On the 19th, the Japanese launched fruitless cpunter-attaeks against our position 3 miles north of Myebon and sustained heavy casualties.Resistance in the Myebon Peninsula is becoming less vigorous.Allied troops have debouched from the Kaladan Valley and are now within miles of Myohaung. Enemy resistance in the village itself is weakening.An outflanking thrust has reached a point 5 miles south of Myohaung.On the 21st, a landing was made by our forces on the northern coast ofRamree Island; opposition was encountered at Kyaukpyu but this was silencedby the naval and air bombardment which preceded the landing.Other Allied troops made&quot; a successful landing on the 23rd 6 miles N.E. ofMyebon. Leading elements of this force have advanced against slight opposition,to the area about one mile west of Kangaw. HProgress has been maintained in Central Burma. Allied troops in theGangaw area have advanced unopposed&apos; some 15 miles to the east and S.E.The village of Monywa fell on the 21st after operations against the garrisonwhich lasted for 3 days.[29119]   &apos; B 2
Myinmu on the Irrawaddy was surrounded by our troops on the 22nd andfell the following day in spite of strong Japanese resistance. Further east, ourleading columns are only 10 miles from Sagaing.Our troops on the Irrawaddy, north of Mandalay, are encountering vigorousopposition. On the 22nd Japanese counter-attacks against the Allied bridge-head 20 miles east of Shwebo were repulsed. Smaller attacks have also beenmade against the bridgehead at Thabeikkyin.Northern Burma.33. Progress has been made on the road to Mong Mit; leading elements.havereached a point 23 miles north of the village. Further east, Mu-Se has been occupied by Chinese and U.S. troops. In this village they effected a link with Chinese troops from the Lungling area, who recaptured the town ofWanting. A through land route to China is now open as a result of these operations.China.34. On the 15th the Japanese thrust eastwards with a small force from theCanton-Kowloon railway area; Waichow was occupied on the 16th. The advancecontinues in a S.E. direction up the coast. In the area west of the Hengyang-Canton railway other Japanese columns, advancing south and east from Taohsien,reached the railway at Ping Shek on the 22nd. Other small Japanese forces have advanced about 40 miles to the east from the Hengyang area.Philippines.    (An outline map is included as.an inset.)Luzon.35. U.S. forces are still meeting stubborn opposition N.E. of San Fabian,where only limited progress has been made.In the eastern sector U.S. forces have made considerable progress, and theirfront line now extends from a point 10 miles east of- Urdaneta southwards toLa Paz.The thrust southwards from San Clemente and Bayambang has been continued on a broad front; Tarlac was captured on the 22nd, and reports state that forward troops have advanced down the road to a point 3 miles north of Clark Field.No serious opposition has been encountered.N.W. of Lingayen, U.S. patrols have reached Cape Bolinao at the head of the peninsula.Japanese casualties up to the 20th number 2,699 killed and 39 prisoners.AIR SITUATION.Europe.United Kingdom.36. Fighter Command flew 21 defensive sorties. Attacks on long-rangerocket activities in Holland are referred to in paragraph 38, and details of enemy activity against this country are reported under &quot; Enemy Activity and home security.&quot;Home Waters.37. Operations were restricted by adverse weather; home-based aircraft of coastal Command flew only 341 sorties (compared with 856 sorties averageprevious four weeks).   Two aircraft are missing.Western Europe.38. During the week ended dawn on the 24th, aircraft of S.H.A.E.F. (Air)flew 9,186 sorties and dropped 3,227 tons of bombs. In the week ended dawn onthe 25th, Bomber Command and the U.S. VIII Bomber Command flew 3,030sorties and dropped 6,589 tons, and U.S. VIII Fighter Command flew 1,532sorties. Fighter Command flew 192 sorties and a total of 525 sorties was flown by aircraft carrying supplies to the Continent. Forty-three enemy aircraft were destroyed. Of 125 Allied aircraft missing and 9 outstanding, 97 were ofS.H.A.E.F. (Air).In the early and latter parts of the period, snow, a gale and fog hamperedall operations.   When the weather permitted, the main effort of heavy bombers
was directed against railway centres, bridges and oil installations in western germany, whilst aircraft of S.H.A.E.F. (Air) attacked enemy troop movements in the Ardennes salient with excellent results.Five railway centres and one bridge east of the Rhine between Frankfurtand Karlsruhe were attacked by escorted U.S. heavies, mainly employing path-finder technique, with unobserved results. Three of the targets were visited twice,and a total of approximately 3,300 tons of bombs was dropped.In a night attack by Lancasters on the Bruckhausen benzol distillation plant at Duisburg, 1,296 tons (including 259 x 4,000 lb.) were dropped in clear weather and excellent visibility. The target was identified visually and bombing was concentrated. Although smoke obscured the target later, crews considered the attack was very successful. Two small attacks by day were carried out byFortresses against the synthetic oil plant at Sterkrade (Holten), one by pathfindertechnique, the other visually with good results. A.F.V. works at Aschaffenburgand Mannheim were&quot; attacked also by pathfinder technique; 236 tons were dropped.Gelsenkirchen was the subject of a night attack by Halifaxes and Lancastersin conditions of 8/10ths to 10/10ths cloud; 511 tons (including 216 tons ofincendiaries) were dropped and although conditions hampered observation, theglow of fires could be seen below cloud. Of some 1,340 fighters which acted as escort for the above and other operations by U.S. heavy bombers 24 aircraft are missing, of which 20 are believed safe. Operations by Mosquitoes of bomber command amounted to 196 sorties and 222 tons were dropped mainly on threechief targets.In the northern sector of the battle area medium bombers, fighter-bombers and fighters attacked defended villages and transport, harassed enemy movement and gave support to the Armies. Approximately 4,600 sorties were flown by fighter-bombers and fighters, and a total of about 370 M.T. and 1,000 railvehicles was destroyed.Weather interfered with operations on the central sector, but upon twosuccessive days fighter-bombers and fighters operating over the Ardennes salientback to the Siegfried line, destroyed over 2,500 M.T. Sorties flown amountedto about 2,600 and the total number of vehicles, &amp;c, destroyed was 3,000 M.T..460 rail vehicles, and 190 A.F.V.; numbers in excess of these were damaged.Fighter-bombers and fighters operating over the southern sector in supportof.the 7th U.S. and 1st French Armies destroyed 66 M.T. and 174 buildings.Small numbers of medium bombers attacked enemy barracks on He d&apos;01eron(SW. of La Pallice) and fortifications at La Rochelle.Attacks were continued against sites, communications and factories forlong-range rockets by aircraft of Fighter Command, supplemented by the tactical air Force. An oxygen plant at Alblasserdam (near Dordrecht) was destroyed and approximately 70 x 250 lb. bombs were dropped by Spitfires in several attacks.The activities of the G.A.F. were restricted and limited by bad weather.The estimated fighter activity was highest on one day with some 170/200 sorties,on other days it approximated 75 sorties.   Negligible opposition was offered to -the attacks by the U.S. heavy bombers and small reaction by enemy night fightersto the attacks of Bomber Command.[Note. :Appendix VII gives Raid Assessment Reports.]Southern Europe.39.   During the week ended dawn on the 23rd, aircraft of the M.A.A.F. flew8,921 sorties (including 2,335 by heavy bombers) and dropped 4,701 tons of bombs.&quot;Twelve enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat and 73 Allied aircraft (including30 heavy bombers) are missing.Italy.40. Unfavourable weather restricted flying, and in some operations by heavy bombers part of the force detailed for the attack was unable to complete the taskon this account.The main effort was directed against enemy communications by day and night, and in particular against railways and bridges in Northern Italy and onthe Brenner route.In a concentrated attack by heavy bombers of the Strategic Air Force, over200 tons were dropped on Udine railway station causing a violent explosionfollowed by fire and thick smoke.
The effort by medium bombers against railway bridge targets from Genoa toGorizia was 100/175 aircraft daily. Direct hits were made on Trento andTreviso railway centres, and on 14 bridges; probable hits were obtained on severalothers. Operations by fighter-bombers and fighters was from 500 to 900 aircraft,when weather permitted, mainly directed against communications and enemysupply lines particularly in the Po Valley. Railway lines were cut in 170 places and 310 M.T. and 290 locomotives and railway trucks were destroyed. damage was also caused to a fuel dump in the battle area and an ordnance factory in theMilan area.Lightnings in an attack on an oil factory at Fiume hit an oil cistern.Yugoslavia.41. Aircraft of the Balkan Air Force attacked shipping near Senj andPola, sinking one 2,500-ton ship, destroying 2 small ones and obtaining hits ona 4,000-ton ship. Harbour installations at Arsa (S. of Fiume), Jablanica, andSenj were attacked with good results. Of a force of 617 escorted Fortressesand Liberators despatched to attack Brod, 210 returned on account of bad weather, the remainder dropped 763 tons in good concentrations on the railway centres, road and railway bridges. Fires Were caused in the railway centres and 2 bridges were hit. One span of the railway bridge at Doboj (N. of Serajevo)was destroyed in an attack by Lightnings which dropped 37 tons.Austria and South Germany.42. Escorted aircraft of the Strategic Air Force made attacks on railway centres at Linz (236 tons) and Salzburg (81 tons), on two oil installations atVienna (356 tons) and one at Regensburg (201 tons). Reconnaissance photo-graphs show that at Linz three main lines were cut and also all lines betweenthe main station and the goods yard. Vienna was attacked by pathfindertechnique with unobserved results; the attack on Regensburg was assessed asgood.Russia.43. Severe weather has restricted flying by the Russian Air Force and theG.A.F. on the Eastern Front. Definite information is lacking, but it is known that over a period of three days some 10,000 sorties were flown daily in central and Southern Poland by aircraft of the Russian Air Forces. On one day long-range bombers attacked Breslau and it is assumed that the Bomber Force on other days operated against railway objectives in the immediate rear of the forward zone.Far East.Burma.44 During the week ended dawn on the 23rd, Allied aircraft flew 4,149sorties, including 2,654 by bombers and fighter-bombers. In addition, Dakotatransport aircraft flew 5/765 sorties carrying 9,980 tons, and light transport aircraft flew 2,732 sorties, carrying 918 men and evacuating 338 casualties. NineAllied aircraft are missing.Aircraft of the Tactical Air Force provided full support for Allied troopsoperating in Central Burma, especially in the Monywa area, good attacks beingmade on enemy positions, stores and lines of communication. On the Irrawaddy,three steamers were set on fire and nearly 600 small craft were destroyed or damaged. Among other targets attacked were the airfields at Meiktila. Kangaung,Kyaunggon and Thedaw, on which Liberators dropped 261 tons of bombs.In Lower Burma, Liberators bombed two airfields near Rangoon, dropping203 tons with satisfactory results. Other Liberators bombed Martaban railwaysidings, while Mitchells bombed several bridges, two of which were destroyed and others damaged. Thunderbolts successfully attacked oil installations nearMagwe.In the Arakan, Liberators and naval aircraft took an effective part in the landing operations on the north coast of Ramree Island, dropping 322 tons of bombs in a well concentrated attack, and the Tactical Air force supported a landing at Myebon.In the North Shan States, attacks were made on enemy troop concentrations,storage areas and cbmmuhicatibns, extensive damage being caused.
China Zone.45. Several attacks were made on enemy shipping at Hong Kong and onthe Yangtze and other rivers. Ten medium-sized ships, one small ship anda destroyer were sunk, and 16 medium-sized ships and about 200 small craft were damaged. Considerable damage was also caused to road and rail vehicles and at least 55 locomotives were destroyed.Among other targets attacked were power plants and factories in Honan,stores at Hankow, and several airfields, including two near Shanghai, where58 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground.In Formosa, 78 Super Fortresses visually bombed Shinchiku (N.W. Coast),dropping 522 tons with good results, and Liberators bombed airfields at Okayamaand Heito. &apos; Carrier-borne aircraft attacked shipping in Takao harbour, leavingseveral ships sinking and burning, and Liberators set fire to 4 ships, outside the harbour.Japan.46 Super Fortresses dropped 160 tons of bombs on the Kawasaki aero-engine works at Akashi and a similar weight on targets at Nagoya, includingthe Mitsubishi aero-engine works. Twenty enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat and 4 Super Fortresses are missing.Pacific47. In the Philippines, Allied aircraft directed their main efforts againstairfields and lines of communication, particularly in Luzon. At the airfields,barracks, dumps and runways were seriously damaged and several aircraft were destroyed. Good results were achieved when attacks were made on troop concen-trations in the Lingayen Plain and on barracks in the Bataan Peninsula. Offthe coasts, one tanker and 3 ships were set on fire and one ship was sunk.In Borneo, the principal events were two attacks on targets at Miri by liberators which dropped 180 tons of bombs; the radio station and several other buildings were considerably damaged. In the Celebes, small-scale attacks weremade on 3 airfields, a camp at Sidate and shipping off Kendari, where 13 schoonerswere sunk or damaged.In the Moluccas, Mitchells and fighters attacked airfields and supply bases in Halmahera, and oil installations and villages in Ceram. In New Guinea, themain targets were villages and supply lines in the Wewak area.Targets in New Britain, New Ireland and Bougainville were attacked by .a total of 400 Allied aircraft, mostly Corsairs.   Good results were achieved,especially at Lakunai airfield (Rabaul) and Kavieng.In the Carolines, Liberators and Lightnings dropped 61 tons on two airfields at Moen, and in the Kazans, 44 Liberators and 12 Mitchells bombed Two Jimaairfield.ENEMY ACTIVITY AND HOME SECURITY.General.48.

Further photographs taken on the23rd January after the Bomber Command attack on the 1st January show that both branches of the canal are still impassable and that the canal is empty for along distance north and south of the Glane Aqueduct (the aqueduct itself hasnot been covered). Repair work to the embankment is proceeding but the breachesstill remain.Bischofsheim Railivay Centre. Interpretation of photographs taken on the13th January is considerably hampered by snow, but it can be seen that as a resultof the U.S.A.A.F. attack earlier on the same day damage has been caused to thelocomotive depot, the wagon repair shops and the goods depot. All through lineswest of the marshalling yard have been cut in several places and there are manycraters in the sidings where some wagons have been derailed or damaged. Thereis considerable business and residential damage in the village of Bischofsheim.Castropy-Rauocel&apos;.- Photographs taken on the 22nd January after the bomber command attack on the 3rd January show damage in the tar distillery to beextensive.

In addition, damage or destruction has been caused to 10 buildings in thenaphthalene and anthracene treatment section and to the electrode plant.It is estimated that production will be cut by more than half for about amonth.&quot;Derben: Photographs taken on the 14th January after the U.S.A.A.F.attack earlier on the same day, though partially smoke obscured, show that themain weight of the attack appears to have fallen across the southern half ofthe underground oil storage depot. A fire is burning in the vicinity of the buriedpumping units at the south-east corner of the depot which it is considered were operating at the time of the attack. The large rail storage siding south of thedepot is not covered but some business and residential damage can be seen tothe south-west.Dollbergen.
