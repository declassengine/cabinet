I.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S  GOVERNMENT)Sjj C R E T5TH FEBRUARY,   19*4-5 COPY NO.JWAR CABINETSELLING PRICE OF HOUSESMemorandum by the Lord President of the council the Question of controlling the selling price ofhouses has been giving rise to increasing public concernand notice has been given to raise on the Adjournmentthe proposal for the appointment of a Select Committeewhich is the subject of a resolution put down by twenty-five members (see Hansard 25th January,  19*4-5* Cols.  959-961 ).2. This matter was considered at their meeting on the2nd February (L.P.(45)  6th Meeting, Minute 2) by the lord president&apos;s Committee who had before them a memorandum bythe Minister of Health and the Secretary of State forScotland (L.P. (45)  28).      The Lord I resident&apos;s committee invited me to bring their views to the attention of theWar Cabinet.3. The figures contained in the appendices toL.P.(*4-5) 28 show that there has in fact been a considerable and steady rise in the prices paid for houses with vacantpossession.      For instance, where houses which changedhands in the five years preceding the war were sold again,with vacant possession, during the last quarter of 194*4-there was an increase in the price paid averaging 75 percent, in England and Wales and 9*4- per cent,   in Scotland.Moreover there is a wide variation between the increases in different areas - in Wales and Central England thepercentage increase is over 100 per cent., whilst in Londonit is only 55 per cent.      For houses without vacantpossession -the increase has been very much smaller - only27.5 per cent,  in England and Wales - though the rate of increase shows a slight tendency to rise.4-It is clear therefore that, so far as houses withvacant possession are concerned,  the problem is rapidlybecoming serious.      The difficulties of finding any effective and practicable means of dealing with it are,however, formidable.      These difficulties may be summarisedas follows:-(a) There is the initial difficulty of deciding thebasis on which any maximum price should bedetermined.      It is doubtful whether there is any general principle which, when applied inpractice, would not cause genuine hardship in large numbers of individual cases.(b) Any scheme of control would be bound to be subjectto widespread evasion.    Even if the vendor did nottalce advantage of one of the-many-ways by which hecould extract from a willing purchaser thedifference between the controlled price and themarket price for his house, it is likely that inmany cases that difference would find its way intothe pockets of middlemen.  -

(c) Should it nevertheless prove possible to deviseand enforce a suitable scheme of control,  theresult might only be that houses which would otherwise have been offered for sale would notbe put on to the market.      Moreover a serious problem would arise as to the allocation of suchhouses as were offered for sale between the very-large numbers of persons who would wish to buythem at the controlled price.Some of these difficulties might bo overcome by providing that all houses coming on to the market during the periodof control should be purchased by the Local Authorities whowould be responsible for selecting suitable leasees.      Thisproposal would, however,  involve placing upon the LocalAuthorities an obligation to buy all houses offered to them;and it would not obviate the danger of houses which might otherwise come on to the market not being offered for sale.5. As at present advised, therefore, the Lord President&apos;sCommittee doubt whether any practicable means of controlling the selling price of houses can be devised.      The fact must,however, be faced that the problem, which is alreadynerious, is likely to become increasingly so during the nextyear or two;    and that there will certainly be widespreadcriticism if members of the Forces on returning home are ableto purchase houses only at temporarily inflated prices   -which ultimately involve them in the loss of a large partof their capital,  and if the disparity between the pricesreceived by house-owners whose properties are compuisoriiyacquired by the State and those who are able to sell in the open market continues to increase.6. In- these circumstances the Lord President&apos;s committee consider that the Government would be well advised to agreeto an enquiry.      They consider, however, that such an enquiry would be more appropriately carried out by a mixed Committeeincluding experts than by a Select Committee.      they accordingly recommend that, when the matter is raised on the adjournment,  the offer of an enquiry by a mixed Committeeshould be made.The terms of reference of such a mixed Commit tee ofenquiry would need to be carefully drawn.      I amdiscussing this with the Minister of Health and hope tobe in a position to suggest suitable terms v/hen the WarCabinet come to consider this paper.-C.R.A.&quot;&quot;ivy Council Office,    S.W.1.,5th February, 192+5.
