(45) 47.22nd January, 1945.WAR CABINET.THE POLISH  &quot;PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT.&quot;Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs.MEETING at Lublin on the 31st December, 1944, the National Council ofthe Homeland, a body which although not elected claims to be representative ofthe will of the Polish people to-day, enacted the transformation of the PolishCommittee of National Liberation into the &quot; Provisional Government of thePolish Republic.&quot;2. Polish circles in this country draw attention to the fact that most of the few remaining members of the former Committee of National Liberation whosenames were at all known in Polish public life have now disappeared in the courseof the transformation and have been replaced by completely unknown men. Someof the better known non-Communist members of the Committee, including theSocialist Wanda Wassiliewska and the Peasant Andrzej Witos, had alreadylost their posts some time before the transformation; the recent changes have carried the process a stage further. Seven members of the Committee are stillmembers of the &quot;Provisional Government&quot; but, with the exception ofM. Osobka-Morawski, who is known to have been a member of the PolishCo-operative Movement, and of General Rola-Zymierski and M. Rzymowski,the members of the &quot;Provisional Government&quot; are apparently quite unknownto Polish official circles here. Both the Socialist Party here and theremnant in this country of the insignificant Democratic Party of pre-war-days have issued announcements disowning the Lublin Ministers whoclaim to be either Socialists or Democrats. M. Mikolajczyk himself states that,with the exception of Stanislaw Janusz, he has never even heard of any ofthe Peasant members of the Committee of National Liberation during the courseof his party career and the Peasant Party in this country has attacked the&quot;Provisional Government&quot; as bitterly as have the Parties represented in thepresent Polish Government in London.3. The portfolios in the &apos;&apos; Provisional Government&apos;&apos; are distributed fairlyevenly between what the Lublin Poles claim to be the four principal political&apos;&apos; Parties&apos;&apos; in Poland to-day (see Annex); but the National Democrats (RightWing and Nationalist), who are in considerable strength-in Western Poland and.in the Polish Government in London, are not represented. The Socialists, led by M. Osobka-Morawski, who combines the offices of Prime Minister and ForeignMinister, hold altogether five portfolios including that of Information and propaganda. The Peasant Party also holds five portfolios including that ofAgriculture. The Workers&apos; Party (i.e., the Communists) hold four portfoliosincluding that which may well be the key to the future regime in Poland, the newly-created Ministry of Public Security. The fourth party, that of the Demo-crats, holds two portfolios. Of these four &quot; Parties &quot; the Workers&apos; Party is theonly one with any real claim to be regarded as such, although the Communistparty has never been strong in Poland. The Socialist and Peasant &quot; Parties &quot;in Lublin now appear to be little more than groups of Left-wing dissidents whichhave taken over the names of two of the leading parties in Polish politics, whilethe only Democrat Party that has hitherto existed was an insignificant groupthat left the Pilsudski camp after the Marshals death.12645   [29091]
)4. The inauguration of the &quot; Provisional Government &quot; was accompaniedby public attacks upon the Polish Government in London. M. Osobka-Morawskideclared that M. Mikolajczyk &quot;must remain in seclusion abroad,&quot; and thereappear to have been demands that he and others among the Poles in london should be deprived of Polish citizenship. M. Osobka-Morawski indicated,however, that there would be a place in Poland for Polish officials in this country,many of whom would clearly be of great use to the Lublin &apos;&apos; Government&apos;&apos; in restoring the administration in Poland.5. M. Osobka-Morawski&apos;s speech in the &quot;National Council&quot; on the2nd January on home and foreign affairs forecast the stamping:out of what he called the &quot;terrorist &quot; organisation which carried out in Poland the instructions of the Polish authorities in London, and the removal from posts in the Adminis-tration and the judicature of all &quot; traitors to the State.&quot; Law and order is to bere-established by means of &quot; the basic cells of our democracy .... the provincial,district and parish National Councils.&quot; Although private enterprise will not be eliminated, it is fairly clear that it will be severely regulated in the interests ofthe State. If the difficulties of reconstruction demand it, compulsory labour willbe introduced. The threat that all those who fail to comply with the instructions issued for the spring sowing will be severely punished is particularly interestingin the light of independent information to the effect that many Poles are showingreluctance to sow &apos;&apos; for the benefit of the Russians.&apos;&apos; Much is evidently beingstaked on the success of the spring sowing, which it is hoped will to some extentcounteract the fall in this winter&apos;s crops, when the area sown was 1,182,500 acresbelow the schedule of the Lublin Administration. The chief obstacle in the wayof an immediate increase in agricultural production is the redistribution of land which is being carried on, with the ultimate aim, it appears, of creating anagrarian society in which every man owns 12-^ acres. According to pressdespatches from Lublin, all estates of over 125 acres are being broken up, andit is claimed that 111,000 peasant families have already received an average ofabout 1\ acres from the redistribution.6. As regards foreign affairs, M. Osobka-Morawski emphasised, first, that poland&apos;s foreign policy would be turned into new channels and would aim atmaking of the solidarity of the Slav nations a constructive influence in the newEurope; secondly, Poland is to be drawn into the closest friendship with theSoviet Union, a friendship which she is to cement by means of a series ofConventions between the two States dealing with consular, railway, postal andtelegraphic and frontier traffic matters; finally, M. Osobka-Morawski assertedthat Polish claims to &apos;&apos; lands on the Oder, the Neisse and the Baltic,&apos;&apos; whichhad long been regarded as justified by the Soviet Union, had now also &quot; foundappreciation &quot; from the British Prime Minister. He described this as &quot;a great success.&quot; General Rola-Zymierski in his speech claimed that the Soviet union would welcome Poland&apos;s expansion as far west of the Oder as she pleased.A.
