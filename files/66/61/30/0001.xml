THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT       j 3 printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET. Copy No..    ^W.P. (45) 75.31s  January, 1945. &quot;WAR CABINET.THE TRANSPORT SITUATION IN FRANCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith a translation of a letter from theFrench Ambassador, enclosing a memorandum by M. Parodi, French Minister ofLabour and Social Security.A. E.Foreign Office, 31st January, 1945.M. Massigli to Mr. Eden.(Translation.) French Embassy, London,My dear Secretary of State, 26th January, 1945.I think that I should let you have the enclosed text of a note drawn up byM. Parodi on the transport situation in France. I am also sending a copy ofthe note to Lord Leathers.The situation revealed in this document is truly devastating. I scarcelyneed to draw your attention to the serious political consequences which it mightentail.I should be grateful if you would kindly communicate the actual factsmentioned by M. Parodi to your colleagues of the British Government.I am, &amp;c.MASSIGLI.(Translation.)Note on the Transport Situation in France.I. Railways.Trucks before the war, 450,000;to-day, 160,000 approximately.Locomotives before the war, 16,000;after liberation, rather more than 2,000;to-day, between 6,100 and 6,200.But this figure has only been reached thanks to repairs hastily carried outwhich leave the engines in a fragile condition.As the stations have been partly destroyed by bombardments in many partsof France, and in particular in the &quot;north, the locomotives are ill-protected andexposed to the frost. Whereas the proportion of machines undergoing runningrepairs was about 20 per cent, before the war, it has how risen to between35 to 50 per &quot;cent.12656   [29155]
The bad state of the sheds in the north is further slowing down repairsbecause the workers have to work partly in the open.In spite of this difficult situation, 30 to 40 per cent, of French rolling-stockis used for military transport for the purposes of the Inter-Allied Command.One thousand two hundred locomotives (out of. the figure of 6,000 mentionedabove), are so used.II. Inland Navigation.The St. Quentin canal, which takes the coal traffic from the north to Paris,froze three weeks ago, thawed and is now once more frozen.Despite this difficult situation, boats and tugs representing a tonnage of5,000 tons are being used for military transport on the Seine (which had notbeen foreseen in any agreement with the Allied Military Command).There is a shortage of tugs.Furthermore, the cold has decreased electricity production (as a result ofa diminution of the pressure-head and the destruction of cables).To sum up (a) The amount of coal reaching Paris has averaged 13,000 tons a day during last week instead of the necessary amount of 25,000 tons.The gas and electricity works in the Paris region are hardly able to continueto function.No distribution of coal has been made to the population of the Paris region.Every day children and old people are dying of cold.(b) Food supplies A great number of towns have bread for one or two days only. On the22nd January there were nearly 800 trains waiting for locomotives (mostly trainswith food supplies).The assistance contributed by the Allied military authorities is confined tothe following promises which are now being carried out : &apos;(a) Six coal trains will be brought to Paris daily by locomotives at thedisposal of the Americans.(b) Sixty French locomotives used for drawing hospital trains will be put at the disposal of French transport as soon as the American machinesare equipped with a heating system suitable for connexion to hospitaltrains.(c) A certain number of English locomotives which. are now stored atDieppe and not used (30 to 60 so it appears from the information available to the French Ministry of Transport) are going to be put into service. It is hoped that they will set free an equivalent number ofFrench locomotives.This assistance is completely inadequate in view of the extremely critical situation of the French railways.The French Government risk being obliged in the near future to warn the Inter-Allied Command that they are obliged to take back a part of thelocomotives which are at present being used for military transport.The actual situation involves, moreover, a very serious danger should theAllied armies advance into Germany, as the greater distances involved would nolonger allow supply by railway.From these two points of view, it is therefore necessary for the Allies tomake a. greater effort to bring into France trucks and, above all, locomotives.The latter would enable the French situation to be remedied immediately andwould be at the disposal of the Commander-in-Chief to ensure supplies if an allied advance took place.So far as concerns inland navigation, it is necessary (1) to put a certain number of tugs at the disposal of French transport;(2) to release the barges and tugs at present used on the Seine for military transport.25 th January, 1945.
