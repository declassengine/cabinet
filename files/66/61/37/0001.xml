THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY G3! HIS.BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMEN1Printed for the War Cabinet.   February1945.SECRET.     - Copy No. ggW.P. (45) 82.5th February, 1945.WAR CABINET.THE INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECTS OF THE COMBINEDBOMBER OFFENSIVE.Joint Memorandum by the Secbetary of State for Air, First Lord of theAdmiralty, Secretary of State for War, and Parliamentary Secretaryto the Ministry of Economic Warfare.A very large proportion of British and American resources has been devotedto the Combined Bomber Offensive. It is most desirable that an investigationshould be carried out: (a) to assess the general and detailed effects of the offensive on the enemy&apos;capacity to wage war;(&amp;) to collect information from which lessons can be learnt about our ownoffensive and defensive methods.2. The investigation must be comprehensive; it must cover not only the primary effects of bombing in destruction of material and casualties, but- alsothe secondary effects on the enemy war machine as a whole. It must be asauthoritative as possible, if it is to provide facts on which Government policycan in future be based.3. We consequently propose that a body to be known as the BritishBombing Research Mission should be set up, with terms of reference as in theAppendix to this paper. The Mission&apos; would be directed by an independentcivilian experienced in industrial and economic matters and appointed for thispurpose. He would be assisted by a Technical Adviser, who would be a scientistof national standing: The staff of the Mission would be composed of representa-tives of the Admiralty, Air Ministry, Ministry of Economic Warfare,^ Ministryof Home Security * and the War Office, who would be associated in .thedirection of the Mission, and of experts drawn from those Departments andthe other Departments concerned, and from elsewhere as necessary. TheDominion Governments would also be represented.4. The Head Office of the Mission would be in London and there would be a forward Headquarters in Berlin and field teams and subsidiary Headquarters inthe various countries concerned. The Mission would be administered by the AirMinistry.5. It is most desirable that the investigation should as far as possible be ajoint Anglo-American investigation. The United States authorities were notprepared to agree to a fully integrated Anglo-American Mission, and a separateAmerican Mission has been appointed at the direction of the President;Mr. Franklin D&apos;01ier, President of the Prudential Insurance Company ofAmerica, has been appointed Chairman, and the Mission is expected to numberabout 1,500 persons; over 300 field workers are under training in this country,and directing and administrative staffs numbering over 100 have been establishedhere and in France.  It is proposed that the British Mission should be instructed* On the dissolution of the Ministry of Economic Warfare and the Ministry of Home Security,their shares of this responsibility would pass to the appropriate successor Departments, inaccordance with whatever arrangements are made to deal with their continuing responsibilities.[29184]
to work as closely as possible with the American Mission, and to place any material they wish at their disposal. The extent to which integration of thework of the two Missions will be possible can only be found by experience. TheRussian authorities have already been informed of the proposal, throughthe machinery of the European Advisory Commission, and it is proposed that theRussian authorities should be invited to participate in the work in whateverway they think suitable; in any event, the material and conclusions of the Missionwill be placed at their disposal, and arrangements will have to be made to securefree access by the Mission to the Russian Zone of Occupation.6. To facilitate Allied co-operation, and for administrative convenience, itis proposed that the forward Headquarters of the Mission, in Berlin, should operate under the administrative aegis of the Allied Control Council for Germany.7. The size of the British Mission cannot be settled until the Head of theMission has drawn up a plan for the work and arrived at an arrangement withMr. D&apos;01ier about co-operation between the two Missions, but it seems likely thatwhen the work in Germany is at its peak the staff will number not less than 500and not more than 1,000, of whom about half would be typists, clerks, drivers, &amp;c.Much of the field work would be completed, and interim reports containing datarelevant to air operations against Japan would be rendered, within a few monthsof the defeat of Germany, but the completion of the report would take very much longer. The expenditure of so much specialised man-power is a formidableproposition, and it is consequently most important that the officers chosen shouldbe of high quality, and, in particular, that the head of the Mission and the restof the directing staff should be capable of phasing and organising the work toprevent overlapping and waste of effort. To assess the effects of an offensive onwhich the nation has employed 2 million men and women for three years is wortha great deal of labour, but only if the report produced is fully comprehensive andcommands the full confidence of all concerned. There are few fields where thereare more-bpportunities and more temptations to draw hasty conclusions frominadequate data, and it is essential that there should be no room for disputingthe accuracy of the facts reported by the Mission, or for claiming that it ignoredsignificant aspects of the field before it.8. We had originally intended that the Mission should aim at completing,before the defeat of Germany, its work in territories already occupied, and shouldmeanwhile be collecting, training and organising staff for its main task inGermany so as to be ready to begin work at full pressure as soon as our armiesmove in. However, the Prime Minister, who has been consulted about theseproposals, does not feel that the man-power situation allows: any considerableadditional numbers to be employed at present on work of this kind. We therefore propose that (a) The Head of the Mission and his Economic and Technical Advisers anda small organising and administrative staff should be appointedforthwith.  The total numbers under this heading would not exceed 30.(b) There should also be appointed an Advisory Committee to assist him,consisting of representatives of the Service Departments, Ministry ofHome Security and Ministry of Economic Warfare. These officers would only give part of their time to the work of the Mission, andwould continue in their ordinary posts.(c) The Head of the Mission should, in consultation with the departmentsconcerned, take over the direction of the personnel drawn from various departments and from the Army and the RAP. who are at present engaged on investigations covered by the terms of reference of theMission, together with the clerical and ancillary staff&apos; serving them.This would include, in particular, a large part of a division of theMinistry of Home Security which has been employed for several years on assessing the results of our bombing, and the R.A.F. personnel&apos; which the Air Ministry has been employing on investigations on the spot as targets which have suffered strategic bombing have been clearedof the enemy. Altogether these existing resources number about90-100 expert personnel, and 70-80 R.A.E. administrative personnel,including clerks, drivers, &amp;c. (It will not, however, include theS.H.A.E.F. Bombing Analysis Unit which is employed by S.H.A.E.F.to investigate the results of tactical bombing for immediate tacticalpurposes.)
(d) As soon as he has made his plan for the organisation of the investigationas a whole, the Head of the Mission, in consultation with the depart-ments concerned, should choose and earmark as many as possible of the personnel needed for the wider investigation, but should not ask for* their services until the work calls for it.A. H. M. S.A. V. A.P. J. G.D. F.APPENDIX.Terms of Reference of the British Bombing Research Mission.To carry out a factual investigation, and to report, upon : (a) The effect on the fighting capacity of Germany and the territories under her control or allied to her during the war, of the strategic bombingoffensive carried out by British Air Forces and those of the UnitedStates of America, between the outbreak of war and the defeat ofGermany. The report should embrace both the individual effects ofthe offensive on the various sections of Germany&apos;s war economy andadministrative structure, and the overall and cumulative effects on her war-making capacity as a whole, including not only the effects of physical damage to structures and equipment but all wider effects of the offensive, including its psychological and moral effects.(6) The comparative efficiency of the various techniques of bombing andof the weapons employed.(c) The nature and success of the defence measures taken by the enemy,including civil defence; the comparative vulnerability of differentstructures and different targets, and the effect of attacks on enemyfortifications. /(d) The accuracy of the assessments of the results of Allied bombing madeprior to investigation on the spot.5th February, 1945.
