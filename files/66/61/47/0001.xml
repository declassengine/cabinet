29/? - -9(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S E C R E T ,*2   f-W.P.(45)  92 COPY NO.   Q ^11TH FEBRUARY,   1945.WAR CABINET&apos; THE AIRCRAFT PROGRAMMENote &quot;by the Minister of production the War Cabinet have amended the January Aircraft Programme-and the new Programme .is now called the February Programme,The Minister of Aircraft Production and I feel That it isnecessary to confirm and issue the February Programme immediately.2.      The alternative is to leave the October Programme inoperation.      This is undesirable because:-(i)    The October&apos; Programme is unrealistic.(ii)    The February Programme is lower in total thanthe October Programme although it provides for increases in jet-propelled Meteor and theSpitfire/Spiteful.(iil)    The February Programme means a maiToower saving of 200,000 as at 31st December,  1945,  since itcalls for 970,000 operatives as against 1,170,000..needed for the October programme.(iv)    Delay in issuing the February Programme willprejudice these savings and will indeed mean a waste of manpower,  for instance on toolingfor type changes which are not required on theFehruary Programme.3.      For these&apos; reasons, without prejudice to further reductions which may be agreed, I ask for confirmation of the proposal toissue the February Programme immediately.Ministry &quot;of Production,a w  -111TH FEBRUARY,   1945.
