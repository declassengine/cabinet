THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(k5) 5925TH JANUARY 9  19U5COPY NO.v/ar -cabinetRELIEF SUPPLIES FOR LIBERATED europe memorandum by the Minister of Pood15I have seen the report of the Deputy Prime Ministersetting out the conclusions reached by the Committee onLiberated Area requirements.2. I consider that the position in regard to PoodSupplies should be made clear.(a) Neither I nor anyone in my department has seen the details of the programme used for theShipping Survey.      I am therefore unable tosay whether tho foodstuffs included in it canor cannot be made available at sources ofsupply.(b) However there, are ample supplies of some foods.such as cereals but an acute shortage of otherssuch as meat.If the required calorie level can be attained byconsumption of the formerv there is no problemon supply grounds. Vx3. The shipping problem is quite a different matter.My food import programme of 6.2 million tons in the first six months of this year itself reduces my stocks by200,000 tons.      I have offered to reduce my stocks by a&apos;further 255?000 tons and&quot;possibly by an additional 99*000tons of Lend/Lease foodstuffs if the Chancellor raises noobjection,h. -Some of this potential saving is on easy shippingroutes and will not, I fear, be of any assistance to theshij)ping problem.5. I can&apos; make these reductions without affecting thelevel of consumption in this country;    any cut beyondthese figures will involve such risks that our own scale of feeding would be endangered.      I am bound to resist that.J. J. L1.Ministry of Pood, W.1.,25th January, 19h7.j
