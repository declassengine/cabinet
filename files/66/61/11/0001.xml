The Admiralty^ original requirements for Fleet Train shipspresented in D.C. (S)  (hh)  15, have had to he reviewed in thelight of the latest strategical decisions, principally becauseof increases in the numbers of men to he fed, and of smallernon-self-supporting craft.     A contributary factor in the indian ocean has &quot;been the shorte.ge of covered storage in Ceylon, whichnecessitates more frequent shipment of food and stores from australia   and the Cape,-2.     The Minister of War Transport has already allocated eightstore issuing ships for which orders have now been placed, but ouroutstanding needs, essential to fulfil the OCTAGON strategy, are for a further 18 large ships (7,000 g.r.t. each) and 13 smallervessels (3,000 g.r.t. each), details of which are given inAppendix A,      These requirements were forwarded to the Ministryof War Transport on 30th November.3,      I have discussed the provision of these ships with theMinister, who has explained that the shipping situation is now more serious than was foreseen at OCTAGON, -and that he cannotallocate further tonnage without your authority.

1+.      If the ships are not provided by the dates given - and thesedates take full account of the postponement of the Third Assault.Force - the deployment of the Fleet both in S.E.A.C. and the pacific will either have to be delayed, or the Fleet will be seriously handicapped as a fighting force,    I must emphasise thatour requirements make no provision for losses and are worked outon the assumption that the average voyage between rear base andadvanced base in the Pacific will be 2,000 miles, a distance whichwill eventually be greatly exceeded.     A recent signal^ from admiral Fraser      shows not only that we have ho margin but thatwe shall undoubtedly need further ships as operations progress.5,      Delay in providing the Fleet Train v/ould mean that HisMajesty&apos;s ships would&apos;have to return to the rear base at frequent intervals, to replenish with food, ammunition and stores.This would seriously reduce the Fleet&apos;s striking power andflexibility.6..     Unless we get the victualling ships we shall be able by july, 19^5 to maintain afloat in S.E.A.C.only 74,000,  and in the pacific only 68,000 men as compared with planned figures of120,00.0 and 91,000.      The situation will improve in the autumn and Winter as new ships already allocated come into service, but even by.the end of 19^4-5,  the figures for S.E.A.C. will be only81,000 (against lZi.0,000)  and for the Pacific 80,000 (against91,000).      To meet the victualling situation I have had to ask the   Minister of War Transport for the temporary assignment of meat and provision ships.    Two large vessels have already been allocated as a stopgap, and their capacity v/ill solve the problem for the time being.    Both the Minister and I realise, however, thatthe temporary use of ships of this type is most uneconomical,7,     Unless the armament store carriers and Issuing ships are provided, the Fleet v/ill find itself short of ammunition after a heavy action and unable to pursue its opportunities.8.      I am not unmindful of the heavy inroads on merchant shippingtonnage which the Admiralty has been forced to make.      In AppendicesC and D I give a complete picture of ships wholly on.admiralty service or which have been allocated by the Minister of War Transport,Despite the most strenusous efforts it has proved impracticable to implement    your direction that the. Admiralty should release230,000 d.w.t.- of ocean-going tonnage in return for the shipsallocated last April.    I have discussed this matter.with the Ministerand explained that the protraction of the German War1 has meant thatI have been unable to give up more than 8I4.,000 d.w.t of which some 27,000 is seagoing and coastal tonnage,    I intend to release a further 120,000 d.w.t,  on or before the end of the German War,but of this some 95,000 d.w. t. v/ill be seagoing and coastal.^    It isthe ocean-going types, both passenger and cargo, that are requiredfor the Far Eastern War.    Of the 336,000 d.w.t. of ocean goingcargo ships and 151,000 d.w.t. passenger ships on service inApril, 19kk a very large proportion are so heavily converted as tobe unsuitable for return;    while of the remainder the vast majorityare ships of the types we now require&apos;in even greater numbers -store carrying and issuing ships.9.      I am afraid I feel 1 have no alternative but to ask you toauthorise the Minister of War Transport to provide the extra   -vessels referred to in para. 2.(Intld.)

APPENDIX &quot;B&quot;The following describes the functions of the various types of ship and gives a brief account of the effect of delay in&apos;theirprovision.Naval Store Carriers (N.S.C.)Ships of approximately 3,000 g.r.t.      They carry replenishmentsin bulk of naval stores and clothing for large ships which willhave to return to the rear base to replenish if there is delay in providing these carriers.Naval Store Issuing Ships (N.S.I.8.)Ships of approximately 7,000 g.r.t.      Their principal functionis to supply destroyers and smaller vessels at the advance base,  andalso the base&apos;s own requirements in the early stages.      without these ships,  destroyers and escorts,will have to return to basebefore they are due for refit (e.g.  a destroyer carries k months&apos;stores but refits only every six months).Armament Store Carriers.    (A.S.0.) Armament Store Issuing ShipsXA.S.I.S.7 of&quot;3,000 g:&quot;r.t.J&quot; &quot;    &quot;     &quot;The A.S.I.S., when possible,  carries a standard load ofammunition and other armament stores ready for issue.      Normallythe A.S.I.S.  will remain at the advance, base and replenish fromthe carriers which bring ammunition in bulk.      Delay in provisionof Carriers would mean that the A.S.I.S. will have to fetch stocksfrom the rear base,  and there would be less ammunition available atthe advance base for immediate replenishment of the FleetsAir Store Issuing Ships (Air S.I.S. ) .   &apos;Ships of 7,000 g.r,to    These ships will carry air stores toreplenish stocks in carriers and. units of the Fleet Train*    Thesestores are vital to the Naval Air Arm.    If the ships required arenot forthcoming,  the.aircraft carriers will have to return to the rear bases;  or ferry carriers, which should be used for the transportof aircraft will have to devote more of their capacity to&apos; .the carriage of air stores.Victualling ,Store--Tissuiingi Ships (V. S. I. S. )Ships of 7,000 g,. r4t,    The shortage of these vessels is acute.There is at present a deficiency of 30% in requirements in the-Indian and Pacific Oceans,    Five of the new ships recently arrived from Canada have developed defects, and have not been available for considerable periods.    There is. insufficient storage accommodationashore in S.E.A.C,    and this entails an increase in the number ofships requiredfor refrigerated storagee    The V. S.I.S. at present available and coming forward will only support 70% of the forceswe expect to be in the whole-Eastern Theatre.    The alternativesare for ships to return to rear bases to re-victual, or a cut in the scale of rations, particularly in meat, and perishables-

Distilling ships the capacity of existing distilling ships (530 tons daily total)must be supplemented by four extra ships with a daily capacity oflj.00 tons of water each and with large water stowage *    Only one ship(hOO tons capacity)  is required in the Pacific, the remainder inS.E.A. 0* Distilling ships are required to meet the needs of thesmaller warships and of the assault forcess    If they are not provided it would be necessary to employ w&amp;ter tankers*    We haveinvestigated the possibility of introducing distilling plant intoships allocated to some other function, but do not. consider thispracticable because -      &apos;(a) distilling ships must be mobile and are requiredto work with the Fleet in forward areas, whereasother Fleet Train ships would be mostly stationed at the advance base;(b) although the distilling ship plant itself is only52 x 27 x Ak ft., stowage must be fitted for 2*000tons of fresh water together with pumps and pipelinese    To do this it would be necessary to sacrifice the essential features of.ships whichare already overcrowded;(&apos; c) Fleet Train ships are already behind schedule andfitting distilling plant is a major item, bound to lead to further delay;(d)    the boiler power of any ship of the Fleet Trainwould almost certainly be insufficient to cope withthe extra load imposed by the distilling machinery.
