(45) 64.24-th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.COMBINED REVIEW OF CARGO SHIPPING RESOURCES.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.THE report of the Combined Military Transportation Committee on DryCargo Shipping requirements for 6 months to the 30th June, 1945. shows a deficiency on British requirements of from 4 per cent, in first quarter to 8 per cent,in the second, and on United States requirements of from 7 per cent, to 9 per cent.2. The United States Military Authorities have adopted the attitude thattheir demands must have first priority and be met in full, though the CombinedShipping Adjustment Board take the view that military requirements shouldnot be excluded from reconsideration. We agree with the Combined ShippingAdjustment Board as, if the cut was applied to civil cargoes alone, which represent only some 20 per cent, of United States shipping, not only their own share ofcivil affairs and the requirements of liberated countries, but our share alsoand the United Kingdom import programme, would be prejudiced unduly.Though classed as civil requirements, all these have a very considerable military aspect. We agree with the Combined Shipping Adjustment Board that theclaim of the United States Military Authorities should be rejected in princeple as we consider that the estimated deficit should be borne on as broad a base aspossible. We further consider that any cut in United States shipping shownin Annex A to Appendix A of the report by the Combined Military Transporta-tion Committee to be provided on our account should not exceed the agreed over-allpercentage without our concurrence.3. In our view, a reciprocal cut which should work out at between 6 per cent,to 8 per cent, of British and American estimated required sailings is probably the best answer.4. From the British point of view we do not think that we should be seriously prejudiced as regards Military shipments by such a cut for the following reasons : (a) Stock positions in North-West European and Mediterranean theatres are good.(b) The Italian theatre is likely to be quieter for some time.(c) &apos;&apos; Dracula &apos;&apos; is uncertain, and in any event the date when full equipment of S.E.A.C. forces and full implementation of the Indian Base com-commitment are likely to be necessary will be delayed.(d) Requirements from theatres on which forward estimates of shippingrequirements are based have in the past, in our experience, beenswollen.5. As regards the British import programme, this is at present under con-sideration by a Cabinet Committee, who have not yet expressed their views as towhether there can be a reduction in shipping requirements over the next sixmonths with&apos;a consequent reduction in stock levels.[29109]
6. It is our view that in spite of their attitude the United States MilitaryAuthorities could easily stand a 6 per cent, to 8 per cent., if not a larger, cut.It is ian interesting commentary on their attitude that there are over 100,000 tonsof United States stores on the quays at Antwerp alone, and that they have asked us for space for 240,000 tons. On the 19th January about 70 United Statesships for North-West Europe were idle awaiting discharge. In face of this they are bidding for 293 ships for N.W. Europe in February as against 259for this month. The Pacific situation is not known to us in detail, but we see no reason to suppose that it is more economically managed._ -7. On the 13th January the Combined Chiefs of Staff issued a strong-directive to Theatre Commanders that they must ensure the quick turn-round of ships, and limit their demands to what they can handle. We can reasonablytherefore take the line that if these instructions are fully carried out thereshould be a reduction in shipping demands from theatres from those tabled tothe Combined Military Transportation Committee. This might well go someway to solving the problem to our mutual benefit.8. The foregoing is based on the present position, and the present accepteddegree of loss. The Admiralty foreshadow the possibility of a much higher lossrate in the early Spring of 1945. How best to meet this by further cuts on shipping requirements, and the allocation of such cuts, should be the subjectof further urgent study and negotiation with the United States authorities.This should not, however, prevent us from seeking agreement as to how to dealwith the deficit estimated in these papers.Recommendations.9.   We recommend that the line to be taken in further discussion with the americans should be:  (i)&apos; We should propose a cut in estimated required sailings on both Britishand American requirements of from 6 per cent, to 8 per cent.; the incidence of this cut within the British and American programmesbeing a matter for the appropriate authorities in each countrysubject to. the understanding that shipments on our account in american-controlled ships should not be reduced by more than the agreed overall percentage without our concurrence,(ii) The proposal of the United States Military Authorities that first priority should be given as a principle to all Military requirements should be contested.(iii) The American Chiefs of Staff should be invited to review their Military^requirements scheduled in Annex A to Appendix A of the repprtby the Combined Military Transportation Committee, with a view-to reducing them to what can reasonably be absorbed through the ports.We further suggest that the decision as to how the British cut should beborne should receive consideration when the result of the Cabinet Committee on british Import Programmes is known.(Signed) A. F. BROOKE.C. PORTAL.ANDREW CUNNINGHAM.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,24 th January, 1945.
