THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1945.SECRET. Copy No.  3W.P. (45) 90.10th February, 1945.WAR CABINET.GOVERNMENT BUILDING PROGRAMME.BUILDING LABOUR ALLOCATION, JANUARY-MARCH 1945.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.I have now considered the labour demands and programmes of the various departments for the period January-June 1945. Draft allocations were originally made on the following assumptions : .(a) European war ending by or about the 30th June.(b) Ministry of Labour and National Service estimate of a labour force(building and civil engineering industries) rising to 517,000 by theend of June. (Note. Later estimate falls short of this by up to5,000).(c) 130,000 men on housing repairs in London until March, reducing to100,000 by June.It was subsequently necessary to review those assumptions to allow for apossible later date for the end of the European war and the probable necessityof retaining until May or June something approaching the present force of labourengaged on London repairs.2. Discussions took place with the Departments at the inter-departmentalCommittee of officials under the Chairmanship of the Parliamentary Secretary tothe Ministry of Works on draft allocations for the period January to June.. Itwas clear from the discussions that the difference between demands and available supply was so large in the second quarter that it was quite impossible to makeany agreed allocations and it was decided to reconsider the matter in mid-March.3. The attached Statement I shows the estimated total available labour forthe period January-March. Statement II shows the allocation which it is nowproposed to make for the period. These are, it is understood, accepted by theDepartments with the following reservations : ?(i) The Board of Trade consider that the proposed allocation in March of6,000 against their demand of 13,000 will not enable them to fulfill their responsibilities in regard to deferred maintenance and rehabilitation of industry. I do not consider, however, that it ispossible at this stage to divert any more labour from the existing government programme on housing. Any case of special importanceput forward by the Board of Trade or by any other Department would of course be considered on its merits by the Minister of Works,(ii) The allowance for housing, primarily the preparation of housing sites,is theoretically inadequate for the estimated programme; but in my view it will not be practicable to expand the present labour force inthe next 3 months at a more rapid pace than has been allowed for.[29211] B
4. I recommend accordingly that the allocations shown in Statement ii should be formally approved and that the question of the April-June allocationsshould be reviewed in mid-March, it being understood by all Departments thatthe most rigorous pruning of programmes will be essential. At the present time there is an embargo on all new works within a radius of 25 miles of CharingCross except those of operational importance or the equivalent. This embargo :- jwill be extended to an area to coincide with the extension by the Ministry ofWorks of the area within which the civil licensing limit will be  10 insteadof  100.   * .(Initialled) O.
