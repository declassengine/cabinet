(45) 6th Conclusions, Minute 9).(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,23rd January, 1945.: ANNEX.ALLEGATIONS AGAINST B.O.A.C.Report by Lord Swinton and Mr. Binder.We have made the investigations required to enable us to answer all thequestions you put to us in the attached list (Appendix I).We have received the fullest assistance from the Air Ministry, from theChairman and Deputy Chairman and officers of B.O.A.C., and from the auditorsof the Corporation, Messrs. Whinney, Smith and Whinney. We have had access to such books, records and documents of the Corporation as we wished to see.We have reached the following conclusions : Accounts.1. The form of the published accounts is determined not by the Corporation,1but by the Secretary of State for Air. The form in which the accounts have been published hitherto has been dictated by security and other war-time reasons, andthe amount of information has consequently been curtailed.2. It is now justifiable to give more information; and the form in whichthe accounts and report for the year ending the 31st March, 1944, will shortly be presented to Parliament will disclose fuller information than in-the past.3. There has been no undue delay in publishing the accounts for the lastfinancial year.4. The system of accounting and internal financial control of the Corpora-tion is satisfactory.Extravagance.5. There are no grounds for saying that the salaries and expenses ofGeneral Critchley or of any senior official of the Corporation are excessive onthe contrary they are moderate.6. Therejs no foundation for the allegation that there have been JC pickings &quot;at the public expense.7.   We are satisfied that the renting of the rooms at the Dorchester Hotel,which have been taken by the Corporation, is a reasonable business expense.[29100] &apos; B.Printed for the War Cabinet.

No. 54 Group and Greyhound Racing Association.8. Twenty-five officers of the Corporation came from No. 54 Group, RoyalAir Force.  All but four continue to draw R.A.F. rates of pay.9. Only three officials of &apos; the Corporation, including General Critchleyhimself, were formerly connected with the Greyhound Racing Association.These three were among the 25 officers who came from No. 54 Group.10. Only one officer from No. 54 Group and none from the greyhound racing Association has been appointed to a vacancy caused by the resignation of another Corporation official. The latter was asked to&apos; resign because the Boardfelt that the department for which he was responsible was in an unsatisfactory state. The Board consider that his successor has fully justified his appointment.The other officers from No. 54 Group have been appointed to fill posts andvacancies caused by the expansion of the Corporation^ business.11. We are satisfied that the Board, when making- senior appointments,have regard only to the merits of the individual and the needs of the business.12. We are satisfied that no special favours have been shown to theGreyhound Racing Association or to officers from No. 54 Group.13. No possible exception can be taken to the transaction under which theBoard leased the premises in Berkeley Square from the Greyhound RacingAssociation.  The Board acted throughout in a proper and business-like manner.General.14.   We found no evidence of irregularity or impropriety of any kind.Our detailed replies to the questions put to us are attached (Appendix II).Any figures contained in or used as the basis for our replies have been certified by the Corporation&apos;s auditors.(Signed) SWINTON.   .B. H. BINDER.23rd January, 1945.Appendix I.ALLEGATIONS AGAINST B.O.A.C.   .List of Questions on which War Cabinet wish to be Advised. .1. Are there any good grounds for criticism of the form of the accounts of B.O.A.C. or of the date at which they were published?   In particular : .(a) Is the form of the published accounts &apos;&apos; such as to conceal vital informa-tion,&quot; and, if so, is the form adopted to be explained by thecircumstances?(b) Has there -been undue delay in publishing the accounts for the yearended the 31st March, 1944 ? . .2. As regards salaries, allowances or perquisites received by GeneralCritchley or other senior officers of B.O.A.C. (a) Is there any ground for alleging that General Critchley and other officersof the Corporation have had &quot; pickings &quot; at the public expense?(b) Have personal servants of members of B.O.A.C. been borne on the Cor-poration&apos;s wages list?(c) Have aircraft for the use of senior officials been improperly fitted withthe most expensive fittings ?(d) Have officials of the Corporation, when they travel on Corporationbusiness, attended to their own affairs at the same time (e.g., when general Critchley visited Stockholm did he take an ex-employee ofthe Corporation for the purpose of discussing Greyhound business) ?(e) At the expense of the Corporation, is a whole suite of rooms kept at theDorchester Hotel for General Critchley and his personal friends?
3. Is there any reason for believing that B.O.A.C. have given unduefavours to the Greyhound Racing Association or officers formerly employed byby that Association?   In particular :-(a) &quot;The salaries and expenses allowances of General Critchley and ofofficers previously associated, with him in the Greyhound RacingAssociation and 54 Group, Royal Air Force, are they &quot; absolutelygigantic &quot; ? .........,,(b) Is it true that the B.O.A.C. has been improperly staffed by the transferof people previously attached to the Greyhound Racing Association?(c) Has property been acquired by the Corporation at exorbitant prices ?(This refers to premises rented by B.O.A.C. from the greyhound racing Association).4. Is there chaos in many Departments of B.O.A.C. because experiencedofficers have been displaced by General Critchley&apos;s nominees?Appendix II.DETAILED REPLIES TO QUESTIONS UPON WHICH THE  war have ASKED TO BE ADVISED.Question 1. Are there any good grounds for criticism of the form of the accounts of B.O.A.C. or of the date upon which they were published?Published A ccounts.The form of the published accounts is not the responsibility of the Board(i.e., the Members) of the Corporation but, under Statute, is determined by theSecretary of State for Air. In any case, the last published accounts, which were those criticised by the Member of Parliament, covered the financial year ended the 31st March, 1943, whereas the majority of the present Board, includingBrigadier-General Critchley, did not take office until after that date.In our opinion, the form of the published Balance Sheet does not call forspecial comment. The Air Ministry/Ministry of Aircraft Production Account,which takes the place of an Income and Expenditure Account, however, as pub-lished in the past, cannot be described as informative, partly because of the largevariety of free services exchanged between the Corporation and the R.A.F. andpartly because of security reasons, which have also obliged other corporations and Public Utilities to publish more or less uninformative accounts or none at all.Shortly after the present Board were appointed and long before the matter was raised in the House of Commons the Board took preliminary steps to make it possible to give more information to Parliament with the published accounts forthe year ended the 31st March, 1944. The Board have suggested, and the AirMinistry agree, that items in the Air Ministry/Ministry of Aircraft Productionaccount previously grouped for security reasons (e.g., &quot; General Administra-tion &quot; and &quot;Losses due to^ enemy action&quot;) should henceforward be shownseparately, and that the Director-General &apos;s report, which accompanies, the accounts, should include a statement showing estimates of the value of the freeservices exchanged&apos; with the R.A.F. This statement will in the nature of thingsnot be a Revenue and Expenditure Account, but it will be the nearest approach to one that it is possible for the Corporation to publish in time of war.We approve this step to make the accounts published to Parliament moreinformative.In addition to the accounts as published, supplementary accounts are pre-sented by the Corporation to the Air Ministry; these are full and detailed and,as the files of the Ministry show, are carefully examined and discussed between representatives of the Ministry and the Corporation, so that the Secretary ofState can satisfy himself that the deficiency grant payable to the Corporationfrom public funds is no more than is necessary.Delay.The accounts and report for the year ended the 31st March, 1944, were approved by the Board on the 14th December, 1944, and were lodged with theAir Ministry on the 31st December, 1944.   They will be published shortly.
. : &quot;For the purpose of the accounts it is necessary to collect returns from many parts of the world; the accounts of overseas stations must be audited locallybefore they are sent to the United Kingdom; adjustments have to be agreed with the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Aircraft Production; finally, the accounts have to be audited in this country. Both the Corporation and theirauditors suffer from the war-time shortage of accounts staff. In these circum-stances, we do not regard the time-interval of nine months as in any wayunreasonable.Our replies to the specific questions which have heen put to us are, there-fore, as follows : ?(a) &quot; Is the form of the published accounts &apos; such as to conceal vitalinformation &apos; and, if so, is the form adopted to be explained by thecircumstances ? &apos;&apos;The Balance Sheet is not uninformative. The so-called Air Ministry/Minis-try of Aircraft Production Account as published in the past cannot be described as informative. The form has been dictated by circumstances and there are no grounds for the insinuation that the accounts have been so drawn as to cover upfinancial irregularities or extravagance. The revised form in which the accounts and report will be rendered this year will give a good deal more information toParliament than has been previously considered possible.(b) Has there been undue delay in publishing the accounts for the yearended 31st March, 1944 where has been no undue delay.Question 2. As regards salaries, allowances or perquisites received by GeneralCritchley or other senior officers of B.O.A.C. -\a) Is there any ground for alleging that General Critchley and other officers of the Corporation have had &apos;&apos; pickings&apos;&apos; at the public expense ?It has been alleged that the Director-General and certain other senior officersof B.O.A.C., particularly those previously associated with the Director-General,have received, by means of undisclosed payments made to them or on their behalf,pickings&apos;&apos; at the public expense which it is further alleged have been&quot;absolutely gigantic.&quot; We regarded this allegation as so serious that we asked the Auditors of the Corporation to supply to us, on their responsibility, complete and comprehensive figures disclosing all payments made to or on behalf of theDirector-General and the senior officers.We should add that the Auditors have informed us that the system ofaccounting of the Corporation is satisfactory, and that the system of internalcheck provides adequate control over all expenditure.Moreover, in the case of every appointment carrying a salary of over  1,000a year, the appointment, the man appointed, and his salary are approved by theBoard.We have carefully examined the payments made to or on behalf of theDirector-General and the senior officers.We can say at once that we are satisfied that there is no ground for allegingthat General Critchley or other officers of the Corporation have had &apos;&apos; pickings &apos;&apos;at the public expense, or that the salaries, expenses or allowances of GeneralCritchley, or of any other senior officer of the Corporation, are unreasonable orexcessive.Without going through all the cases we have examined, we think it fair togive particulars with regard to General Critchley and certain officers who havebeen closely associated with him in the past.General Critchley, Director-General, receives a salary of  5,000 a year andan expense allowance of  1,000 a year. As in the case of other officers of theCorporation, the cost of travelling and accommodation actually incurred by himwhen travelling on the Corporation^ business is borne by the Corporation, andsimilarly he is entitled to expenses, in respect of special entertainment upon alarger scale than the normal entertaining, which is intended to be covered by hisfixed allowance.The auditors have certified that the total sums paid by the corporation for such expenses incurred by General Critchley in addition to his salary andallowance, in the financial year ended the 31st March, 1944, were  599 3s. Id.,and in the six months ended the 30th September, 1944, were  98 19s. 2d.
These sums are divisible as follows :-Financial Year Six months ended Ended31st Mar., 1944. 30th Sept., 1944.      S.  d.

It is fair to add that he has not made a claim onthe Corporation for any part of the salary of his Private Secretary.Group Captain Wilson (ex-Greyhound Racing Association and 54 Group,R.A.F.), Assistant to the Director-General, receives a salary of  1,500 but noexpense allowance. The expenses paid to him during both periods amounted to 3 5s.Group Captain Back (ex-54 Group, R.A.F.), Assistant Director-General(Administration), receives a salary of  2,500 and a fixed expense allowance of 250 per annum. The total additional expenses borne by the Corporation inrespect of this officer during the two periods are as follows: Six MonthsPeriod Ended31st Mar., 1944. 30th Sept., 1944.      S. d.

This officer is secondedfrom 54 Group and as a seconded officer receives the pay and allowances of hisTank but no Corporation expense allowance.   The total additional expenses[29100] - . c

No part of the salary of the personal secretary or the wages of the chauffeur is borne by the Corporation. Theservant not only looks after General Critchley, but spends part of his time working for the Corporation. He is paid  3 5s. a week by the Corporation, ofwhich  2 105. is refunded by General Critchley.there is one further incident to which we ought perhaps to refer to complete the story. The Corporation have a training school for stewards. In order towiden the,experience of some of these trainees, General Critchley takes one at atime to serve in his own house. But General Critchley has made a point ofrefunding to the Corporation the wages paid to such trainees while working inhis house.Subject to the above, we are assured these are the only instances in which itcan be suggested that servants of any member of the Corporation figure on theCorporation^ wages list.Question 2 (continued) (c) Have aircraft for the use of senior officials been improperly fitted with the most expensive fittings ?The answer is : &quot; No.&quot;It has been the practice both in Transport Command and in B.O.A.C. fromtime to time tc fit certain aircraft with equipment which, while by no meansextravagant, exceeds the bare minimum which is provided on some aircraft in war-,time. Aircraft so fitted are regularly used on their journeys by Cabinet Ministers.,Ambassadors and senior officers, Service and civil, and aircraft similarly fittep.have been occasionally used, when available, by members of the Corporation;including the Chairman and Director-General, when making special tours accom-panied by officials.. The standard of comfort provided is inferior to that whichpassengers would expect on a peace-time airliner, and there is, therefore, in ouropinion, no foundation for this charge. We thought it desirable, however, to satisfyourselves on a matter which we regarded as more important, namely, that aircraftso fitted were not kept idle, and we are assured that as soon as any aircraft has completed a special journey it is put back into normal service.Question 2 (continued) -(d) Have officials of the Corporation when they travel on Corporationbusiness attended to their own affairs at the same time (e.g., when general Critchley visited Stockholm did he take an ex-employeeof the Corporation for the purpose of discussing Greyhoundbusiness ?)We are satisfied that officials are not allowed to travel overseas except pp.the business of the Corporation, and all officials appointed by the Board areemployed whole-time on the Corporation^ business.
As for the occasion when General Critchley visited Stockholm, we haveinspected the passenger list and are satisfied that the only passengers carriedwere: -(i)&apos; General Critchley himself,(ii) Three officials of the corporation accompanying him on his mission, none of whom had been connected with the Greyhound Racing Association,(iii) Two Swedish shipping experts who were granted passages at thedirection of the Air Ministry.Question 2 (continued) &apos;(e) At the expense of the Corporation, is a whole suite of rooms kept atthe Dorchester Hotel for General Critchley and his personalfriends ?Rooms are kept at the Dorchester Hotel, but not for General Critchley or his personal friends. The Corporation rent a sitting-room, bedroom and bathroomat the Dorchester Hotel at  1,000 per year, plus 10 per cent, for service. Therooms are kept for the use of important passengers who may not have been pro-vided with suitable accommodation on arrival from overseas or who are held upin London before departure. When the bedroom is not so used it is available to officials on payment to the Corporation of  1 per head per night. The! sitting-room is used for entertaining by the Chairman, the Director-General and senior officials of the Corporation or for occasional business meetings. The cost ofentertaining in this room is borne by the official if it is within the scope of his.fixed expense allowance. The rooms, when free, are occasionally used by theDorchester Hotel Management, and in that case they make a suitable deduction from their charges.We consider that this is a reasonable arrangement for the Corporation tohave made in the interests of their business. We should add that the AirMinistry was informed of the intention of the Corporation to rent these roomsand, rightly in our opinion, took no exception to the proposal.We are satisfied that the rooms at the Dorchester are not used for privatepurposes at public expense, either by General Critchley or by any other members or officials of the Corporation.Question 3. Is there any reason for believing that B.O.A.C. have given unduefavours to the Greyhound Racing Association or officers formerlyemployed by that Association?We can say at once that we are satisfied that no undue favours have been shown by the Corporation to the Greyhound Racing Association or to officialsformerly employed by them. Our comments on the specific allegations are asfollows : Question 3 (continued) (a) The salaries and expenses allowances of General Critchley and ofofficers previously associated with him in the Greyhound RacingAssociation   and   54   Group,   Royal   Air   Force,   are   they* &quot;absolutely gigantic&quot;?We are satisfied that there are no grounds whatever for asserting that the salaries and expense allowances of General Critchley and of officials previouslyassociated with him in the Greyhound Racing Association and No. 54 Group ofthe R.A.F. are &quot; absolutely gigantic.&quot; The facts are set out fully in our replyto question 2(a). Their remuneration is not excessive. On the contrary, the scales of remuneration are, in our view, moderate. Apart from General Critchley,Group Captain Wilson, Group Captain Beck and Wing Commander Stewart,who have been released from the R.A.F. and whose remuneration has been fixed by the Corporation on the basis shown in our reply to question 2 (a), other officialstransferred from No. 54 Group, R.A.F., numbering 21 in all, are paid at Royal(( Air Force rates appropriate to the acting ranks which they held in &quot;the Service :they are eligible for travelling and subsistence allowances at the Corporation^scales in lieu of R.A.F. rates. V[29100]
Question 3 (continued)- (b) Is it true that the B.O.A.C. has been improperly staffed by thetransfer of people previously attached to the Greyhound RacingAssociation ?Group Captain Wilson, Assistant to the Director-General, and SquadronLeader Bromley Davenport, General Services Controller, are; apart from GeneralCritchley himself, the only employees of the Corporation who were&apos; previouslyassociated with the Greyhound Racing Association.In deciding whether or not a post was improperly, staffed, we have adopted the following tests  :(a) Is the post itself one which the Board or the Management consider isrequired in the interests of the business ?(b) Was the post honestly filled in the sense that the man was selected because he was believed to be suitable for the post and not because he hadbeen connected with the Greyhound Racing Association ?The Chairman and Deputy Chairman (who impressed us as having a detailedknowledge of senior staff appointments and of the business generally), havecategorically assured us that these questions oan be confidently answered in the affirmative in the case of both officers concerned.The specific question is confined to the Greyhound Racing Association butwe think it desirable to add a few words about the other officers who came to theCorporation from No. &apos;54 Group, R.A.F.The business of the Corporation has expanded rapidly and is continuing to expand. The capacity ton-miles operated by the Corporation in 1941-42 was15 million, in 1942-43 was 24 million, and in 1943-44 31 million. The passengerscarried in these years were 30,000, 50,000, and 72,000 respectively. this expansion has required a great reinforcement in pilots, crews, administrative officers and&apos; ground staff of all kinds, iand part of these requirements has been met by seconding upwards of 1,400 officers and airmen from the R.A.F. to theCorporation. These officers and men receive the pay of their acting rank at thetime of secondment. Among this large number were 21 officers seconded from54 Group. Four other officers from 54 Group (including General Critchleyhimself) have been released from the R.A.F. for service with the Corporation;and their remuneration has been fixed by the Corporation at the rates shown inour reply to question 2 (a).Some of the officers from 54 Group were asked for by General Critchley by name because of his experience of them when he was in. command of the Group.Others were selected by the Air Ministry. The Chairman and the deputy chairman assure us that they felt themselves fortunate, in the conditions of expansion referred to above, that the Director-General had knowledge of a pool of officers who bad proved their worth under his command.Question 3 (continued) (c) Has property been acquired by the Corporation at exorbitant prices ?(This refers to premises rented by B.O.A.C. from the greyhound racing Association.)We have examined the circumstances in which premises at Berkeley Squarewere leased by the Corporation in December 1943 from the Greyhound RacingAssociation. The Corporation required new accommodation for two reasons :first, their other Headquarters Offices at Victoria had been damaged in an air raid, and, secondly, they had to find accommodation for a number of their staffwhom the Board wished to remove from. Bristol to London in order to run thebusiness of the Corporation more effectively.The rental for the premises is  10,031 a year. Of this amount,  1,031 isfor improvements and fixtures, representing 10 per cent, of the amount expendedby the Greyhound Racing Association which&apos;is intended to cover interest andamortisation. The balance, i.e.,  9,000, is exactly the rent which the greyhound racing Association were paying before the war; in other words, the premiseshave been leased on the basis of the 1939 rental. The sub-lease to the corporation is terminable at short notice. Before the premises were taken, Messrs. Rogers,Chapman &amp; Thomas, Surveyors and Valuers, were consulted and they advised that the terms were reasonable.
In view of his connection with the Greyhound Racing Association GeneralCritchley took no part in the negotiations.Accommodation in London was difficult to get hold of at the time as it stillis. We are satisfied that the matter was handled by the Corporation in a business-like manner and that the terms were not only reasonable but advantageous tothe Corporation.Question 4. Is there chaos in many Departments of B.O.A.C. becauseexperienced officers have been - displaced by General Critchley&apos;snominees ? , ,Only one senior official of the Corporation Mr. Handover who was the traffic Manager has been replaced by a former associate of General Critchley.Mr. Handover was not &quot; displaced &quot; by a Critchley nominee because, irrespective of who should take his place, the Board called upon him to resign as they weredissatisfied with the organisation overseas of the Department for which he was responsible. Subsequently, Wing Commander Stewart, an ex-officer of No. 54Group (of whom details are given in our reply to question 2 (a) above), wasappointed by the Board as Assistant Director General (Commercial) and his duties include those previously undertaken by Mr. Handover. In the opinionof the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman, Wing Commander Stewart hasfully justified his appointment and, so far from causing chaos, has greatly improved the organisation of the Traffic Department which was in an unsatis-factory state when he took it over.Another experienced officer who resigned recently was Mr. Burke, theCorporation^ Chief Engineer. He was not replaced or displaced by a Critchleynominee and, in fact, his post has not yet been filled. However, we looked care-fully into his case because of the specific allegation made by Mr. Hopkinson thatthere was chaos in the Engineering Department in particular.* It would obviously be impossible for us to express an opinion upon theefficiency of the engineering side of the Corporation^ business without con-ducting, with competent assistance, an investigation into the whole of theCorporation^ engineering organisation at home and overseas. But we aresatisfied that this matter has engaged,&apos; and continues to engage, the close attentionof the Board. The position as explained to us by the Chairman and deputy chairman is as follows : Mr. Burke is a highly competent engineer, but because of a difficult person-ality, he did not work well with his colleagues and was unable to get the best outof his subordinates, The Chairman and Deputy Chairman considered whetherthey ought not to call for his resignation; but at the instance of General Critchleyhimself, decided to give Mr. Burke a further trial. When some months later he asked to resign in order to go to a better paid post in Industry, the Board made no effort to retain him. Mr. Burke&apos;s deputy is carrying on satisfactorily in his place. On the maintenance side, the deputy has under him an excellent mainten-ance engineer who has been with&apos;the Corporation and their predecessor for manyyears.While satisfied that the day to day running of the Corporation^ fleet is incapable hands, and adequately provided for on wartime standards, the Boardconsider that future development and expansion will necessitate a strengthening of their engineering side. But they are anxious not to make hasty appointmentsfrom the limited field available in war-time and they wish to make the bestpermanent appointments possible as and when suitable men become available from a wider field of choice.  In this we think they are well advised.We should perhaps mention that another senior member of the EngineeringDepartment (Major Heenan) has asked to resign. The Board would have liked to retain his services but they felt they would not be justified in giving him thelatitude and scope in regard to research and development which he insisted on as a condition of remaining in the service of the Corporation.In these circumstances we can find no justification for the allegation thatchaos exists in departments of the Corporation because experienced officers havebeen displaced by General Critchley&apos;s nominees. -(Signed) SWINTON.B. H. BINDER.23rd January, 1945.
