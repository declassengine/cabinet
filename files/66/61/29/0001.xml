THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET. CoPy No-W.P. (45) 74.- * i &quot;531st January, 1945. .    .      -j? :WAR CABINET. f/i-K&quot; -VREPORT FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER 1944 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES and mandated TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.Mr. Mackenzie King having survived the crisis caused by the difficulty of keeping up the flow of trained reinforcements for the Canadian Army (seeReport for December), the political storm is now dying down. The Frenchnationalist press naturally accuses the Government of betrayal, but the FrenchLiberal papers, though cautious in their comments, argue that the voluntary system is in fact being maintained. But the controversy seems to have had twodefinite results : it has widened the breach between French-Canadians and therest of the country, and it has weakened the prestige of the Government.2. A dispute has arisen between the provincial Government of Saskatchewanand the Federal Government over seed grain notes, held &quot;by the chartered banksand representing advances made by municipal authorities to farmers in 1938.These notes are protected by guarantees of both Governments. The SaskatchewanGovernment is willing to pay 50 per cent, only of these obligations, an offer which has been refused by the Federal Government, which in turn threatensto withhold further grants. The C.C.F. won the recent Saskatchewan electionon, a Social Credit programme -and it now seems likely that it must break itspledge with the farming community, repudiate its obligations to the electorate,and fail to provide proper health and social service programmes or else repudiateits obligations on the public debt of the Province. The acting Premier of theProvince has stated that &quot; no one doubts which alternative we shall follow &quot;3. General McNaughton, Minister of National Defence, has accepted an invitation from the Greynorth (Ontario) Liberal Association to stand for thatconstituency in a by-election which is to be held shortly. He will be opposed by Mr. Garfield Case, Mayor of Owen Sound, who had already been chosen asProgressive Conservative candidate for the next General Election.4. It is reported that the former Ontario Premier, Mr. Mitchell Hepburn,has been chosen as leader of the Ontario Liberal Party. Mr. Hepburn left theLiberal Party during the Ontario election of 1943, and became an Independent,but he has since returned to the Liberal fold.5. Addressing an anti-conscriptionist meeting at Quebec, Mr. Rene Chaloult,a National member of the Quebec legislature, said that Canada&apos;s constitution should be amended after the war to allow Quebec to decide its own external policyindependently of the other provinces.6.   Mr. Camillien Houde has been again elected Mayor of MontrealFormerly provincial leader of the Conservative Party of Quebec, and four timesMayor of Montreal, Mr. Houde was interned in August 1940,&apos; by the federal authorities for advising people not to comply with the national registrationregulations,4 and was released last August.
7. The Prime Minister announced in Parliament that the General Electiondate would be fixed as soon as the Allies decide that the war in Europe is over.An announcement is likely before the 17th April, when the present Parliamentends.8. Mr. L. B. Pearson, O.B.E., has been appointed Canadian ambassador to the United States in succession to the Honourable Leighton McCarthy, K.C.Service Activities.9. On the 10th December, H.M.C.S. Prince David- (L.S.I.) was damaged by mine off the Piraeus but there were no casualties.10. On the 18th, H.M. Canadian Frigates Montreal and Ribble picked up36 survivors from a U-boat which ran aground on Wolf Rock and foundered.11. On the 24th, H.M. Canadian minesweeper Clayoquot was sunk by aU-boat off Halifax; 64 survivors were picked up.12. On the 27th, H.M. Canadian Frigate Kokanee and other frigates of an escort group while escorting a homeward bound convoy from Canada sank aU-boat N.W. of the Azores, taking 44 prisoners including the Captain.13. Though there were several patrol clashes during the early days of themonth there has been no real activity on the Canadian First Army front.14. In Italy, Canadian troops, who had come into the line on the right flank of the Eighth Army, went over to the offensive on the 3rd, and breakingthrough the enemy defences, outflanked Russi to the east and west and enteredRavenna. On the 5th, the advance was continued north from Ravenna up Highway16 until it was held up at Mezzano where both the rail and road bridges had been blown.15. On the night of the 10th/11th, Canadian forces continuing the offensivelaunched an attack across the River Lamone to the east of Lugo, where twobridgeheads were quickly established, soon consolidated and linked together. Onthe 13th, the advance continued with Canadian infantry establishing a bridge-head over the Naviglio Canal and holding it against repeated counter attacks.16. For the remainder of the month hard fighting took place in the area ofBagnacavallo, where little progress was made owing to the enemy being able todefend the numerous waterways in that area. Many prisoners were, however,taken, and by the end of the month the town itself had been captured and canadian troops were established along the east bank of the River Senio.17. A total of 44 R.C.A.F. Squadrons were operational overseas during themonth of December : 23 in the United Kingdom, 17 on the Continent, one in Italy,one in India, one in Burma and one in Ceylon. In addition, an R.C.A.F. (AirOp.) Squadron, the first of three, was formed on the 9th December, but is not yetoperational.18. Heavy bombers of No. 6 R.C.A.F. Group flew 1,917 sorties during themonth of December: this compares with 2,068 sorties flown, in the month ofNovember, but the number of flying hours is slightly higher.&apos; Losses for themonth totalled 18 aircraft against 16 in the previous month. Targets werefactories, oil refineries and marshalling yards in Germany and tactical targets&apos; insupport of the Allied armies. From the 1st to the 18th, five enemy aircraft were claimed as destroyed and two as damaged.19. Beaufighters, Sunderlands and Wellingtons of R.C.A.F. CoastalSquadrons flew 2,323 operational hours for the loss of one aircraft. Beaufightersof No. 404 Squadron in company with other RAP. Squadrons attacked a2,000-ton vessel, which was subsequently beached and left burning. Wellingtonsof No. 407 Squadron sighted and attacked two U-boats, but no assessment of these attacks has been received to date.20. R.C.A.F. Squadrons of Second Tactical Air Force flew 3,866 sortiesduring the month, which is an increase of some 300 over those flown by the samesquadrons last month. Many more enemy aircraft were encountered during december as compared with the previous month and 55 of these are claimed asdestroyed, with three probably destroyed and 15 damaged. Losses amount to 22aircraft.
21. Aircraft from the three Canadian Squadrons of Fighter Command flew127 sorties; No. 406 Mosquito Squadron claiming two enemy aircraft for the lossof one.22. Catalinas of the Canadian Squadron in the Air Command South-east asia flew nine sorties without loss. This squadron has been non-operationalsince the 5th December, pending return to the United Kingdom.23. No. 417 Fighter Squadron located in Italy flew 142 sorties during thefirst two weeks of the month for loss of four aircraft.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.24. Addressing the House of Representatives, Dr. Evatt, Minister for external Affairs, said that there was reason to believe that the United Kingdomand the United States Governments would recognise the claim of the australian and New Zealand Governments to a full share in arrangements to be made at all stages of planning for the armistice and post-armistice period in the war against japan, but that it would be wrong to contend that Australia and New Zealandcould have exclusive concern with the future of any part of the Pacific region.25. A serious industrial crisis threatened to develop over the miners&apos;refusal to accept the Government order curtailing their Christmas holiday, andthe decision to garnishee wages to pay fines, but, after last-minute negotiations between an emergency committee of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and representatives of the Miners&apos; Federation, the central executive of the Miners&apos;Federation issued a direction that all miners should resume work on the2nd January. Mr. Forde, the acting Prime Minister, announced that a commis-sion of enquiry Would be established to examine and report on all matters affectingthe efficiency and continuity of coal production.26. The acting Prime Minister announced that the Australian Cabinet had approved in principle a special scheme of child migration to Australia. What isproposed is that the Commonwealth Government should set up machinery toarrange with European Governments, and with international bodies such as u..N.R.R.A., to select and bring to Australia suitable orphans and other children from Europe to the extent of an average of 17,000 yearly. This scheme is not intended to replace existing child migration schemes but to supplement them.  .27. The arrival of Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser and R.N. personnel excitedmuch interest and enthusiasm.28. The War Cabinet has adopted plans for the post-war training ofAustralians in Britain for post-war employment while awaiting their return toAustralia. The decision involves a number of prisoners of war and internees whohave been repatriated to Britain, as well as disabled men.29. All existing non-Labour parties have agreed to form a new liberal party of Australia, under the direction of Mr. Menzies, Leader of the FederalOpposition. The Country Party, while giving its blessing to the new party, havedecided to preserve its separate identity. -30. M. N. M. Livanov, who has been chief of the Far Eastern Departmentof the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Moscow since 1938, has been appointedSoviet Minister to Australia in place of M. Vlasov.31. Sir Raghunath Paranjpye, first High Commissioner for India inAustralia, has arrived in Canberra.32. Lord Nuffield, who is on a tour of the Dominions to investigate thepossibilities of the post-war market for British cars, has also arrived.Service A activities,33.   H.M.A.S. Shoalhaven was launched on the 14th of the month.34. The strength of the Royal Australian Navy as on the 30th November,1944, was: active list, 8,308; reserve, 26,436; W.R.E.A.N.S., 2,145.35. In accordance with the Governments decision to release army personnel to industry, total of 32,407 were discharged between the 1st October, 1943. andthe 10th December, 1944.
36. Strength of the Australian Army as on the 9th December, 1944, was :males, 388,348; females, 25,052; totalling 413,400.37. Total strength of the United States forces (Army and Air Corps) in theSouth-West Pacific area on the 8th December was 780,898, including 141,871 ofthe Air Corps.NEW ZEALAND.38. There has been strong local Labour criticism of United Kingdom inter-vention in Greek affairs, as many New Zealanders feel that they have firm tieswith the Greeks, because their men fought.in Greece in 1940. Many labour organisations have asked the Government to use its influence against intervention.Press comment, on the other hand, has almost without exception endorsed theUnited Kingdom attitude and actions.39. Some prominence has been given to a report on the burning of ballot papers of overseas voters in last year&apos;s General Election, and the Government hasbeen accused of serious mismanagement, if not of actual falsifying of the returns.There was also some criticism of a proposal to increase the salaries of Members ofParliament, on the ground that the proposal, though desirable, is untimely.40. In general, there is continued evidence of the desire of New Zealand toassist the United Kingdom by making purchases of United Kingdom exports, assoon as these can be resumed, though at the same time there are signs of growingdisappointment on the part of would-be importers at the inability of UnitedKingdom exporters to give firm indications about deliveries. It is hoped that theWhite Paper on the&apos; United Kingdom war effort which demonstrates the extentto which United Kingdom manufacturers are still engaged on war production,will help to dispel any feelings of impatience on that score.41. Much interest was shown in, and a warm welcome given to, the delega-tion of the National Farmers&apos; Union which is now on a visit to New Zealand.42. &apos; Satisfaction was expressed at an announcement by the New zealand government that the price of wheat would be increased by a bonus on the increasedacreage planted during 1945.43: Mr. Peter Fraser, the Prime Minister, paid a visit to Samoa and Tonga,for the first time since the war began.Economic.44. Mr. D. G. Sullivan, Minister of Supply and Munitions, and of Industryand Commerce, arrived in the United Kingdom on the 16th December afterattending the Civil Aviation Conference at Chicago.45. Mr. Sullivan during his visit proposes to discuss certain Supply andEconomic questions, in particular (i) Current problems relating to the supply to New Zealand of rawmaterials, plant and equipment, and civilian goods;(ii) United Kingdom export policy and prospects, with particular referenceto supplies after the end of the German war.Service A activities.46. On the night of the 14th-15th New Zealand and Indian troopsre-assumed the offensive. Resistance on the right flank of this attack was stub-born but slightly less towards the left flank.47 Good progress was made on succeeding days, and on the 17th Faenza was cleared and the area south of Highway 9 and east of the River Senio was in our hands.48. New Zealand troops then tried to push north from Highway 9 betweenFaenza and the Senio River, but the enemy held the line of the railway mostdeterminedly&quot;.49. On the 20th, New Zealand forces were able to make good progress north of the Highway and reached the Senio River against little opposition.50. During the last week of the period under review New Zealand andBritish troops, although hampered by bad weather and difficult country, steadilycleared the area between the Lamone and Senio Rivers.
UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.51. Speaking to a motion at the United Party&apos;s congress in Bloemfontein,that immediate steps be taken to bring about the union of all British possessionsin Africa and the Union in a single self-governing State, the Prime Minister said he did not think that a strong case could be made for advocating the unification of all territories in one big State. The Government^ Pan-African policy wasone of an African community of States, working together and helping each other.The motion was dropped.52. At this Congress, General Smuts announced that the government intended to ban the Afrikaans organisation known as the Broederbond (Unionof Brothers), which he described as a &quot; dangerous political Fascist organisationof which no public servant, if he is to retain his loyalty to the State and administration, can be allowed to be a member.&quot; It was revealed that theSociety had a membership of 2,500, composed mostly of public servants and teachers. Action has since been taken to compel Civil Servants to resign fromthe organisation.53. A new situation has arisen in connection with the dispute betweenIndians and Europeans in Natal over the recent Property Ordinances (see para-graphs 35-36 of Report for December) as a result of the Prime Minister&apos;s replyto a deputation from the Natal&apos;Indian Congress. The two Indian members ofthe Broome Judicial Commission have resigned on the ground that the work ofthe Commission has been destroyed by the recent events in Natal.54. The Minister of Welfare and Demobilisation, Mr. Lawrence, speakingat Johannesburg, announced that South Africa&apos;s demobilisation scheme would come into full operation on the 3rd of January. The main points of the planare grants and loans to ex-volunteers, without means tests, all clothing is to beretained, and 10,000 jobs are earmarked for the ex-service men and women.55. No settlement has yet been reached in the native transport dispute inJohannesburg, and thousands of natives are continuing the three weeks&apos; boycott of the bus services to and from the outlying native township. The official decisionto pass on the cost of increased fares to the employers of native labour has provedunworkable. Recent riots involving natives and Europeans are regarded asindications of growing racial unrest in suburban areas.56. There was a sharp decrease in the production of butter, bacon, mutton,beef and eggs, although reserve stocks of some of these are high. This haspartly been caused by drought in the Transvaal and Orange Free State.57. Mr. Pirow&apos;s latest effort to save his New Order from complete politicalobscurity is the publication of a news-letter, which, he claims, will give an honestanalysis of the news &quot; in contrast to all other publications.&quot;58. The first &quot;Nationalist Party Congress&quot; to be held in South-WestAfrica has been widely reported in Opposition newspapers.59.   Lord Nuffield paid a visit to the Union while on his way to Australia.EIRE.60. Asked in the Dail on the 29th November whether a statement made bythe Under-Secretary for Dominion Affairs in the House of Commons, that Eireis part of the British Commonwealth of Nations, is correct, and if not, whether hewould consider a public denial, Mr. de Valera said that their position with regardto the British Commonwealth of Nations is governed by, and defined legally in,Section 3 (1) of the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936, and that section 4 (2) of Article 29 of the Bunreacht (Constitution) gives the Governmentcertain powers in the executive domain in regard to their external relations. he went on to say that he did not propose to try to paraphrase the documents or togive any definition to the relationship established by them, save that containedin the words of the documents themselves, and he did not think it necessary todo so, nor did he think anything would be gained by attempting it. When pressed for a clear answer to the question, Mr. de Valera said that the matter was settled back in 1936 and 1937 by the External Relations Act&apos; on the one hand andthe Constitution on the other, and that it is not proposed to change it at themoment.
61. Asked in the Dail whether he was aware of the desire of all nationalparties in both Eire and Northern Ireland for a conference on the question of partition, and whether he intended convening such a Conference, Mr. de Valerasaid that he did not think that such a conference at the present time could-effect anything useful. He added that it was well-known that all parties in eire and all nationalists in the Six Counties ardently desired the restorationof the Six Counties and the unity of the national territory. He concluded by saying that the Government has this problem foremost in its mind.62. In answer to a question in the Dail whether the Government wouldinvestigate the possibility of introducing, a&apos; comprehensive scheme of social security in Eire, Mr. de Valera said that&apos;the proposals&quot;in the recent British white paper had been given some consideration, but it was not possible at that stage to estimate with any degree of reliability what their political, social or economiceffects on Eire are likely to be. He went on to say that the scope of their social services must be determined by their own domestic circumstances, and theycould not accept the principle of adopting automatically the schemes deemedsuitable by other countries whose needs and resources in no way correspond withthose of Eire. Further developments in social services, he added, depend on anumber of factors Which are for the most part indeterminate at the present time,but broadly it could be stated that no further considerable expansion of social services in Eire would be possible without an appreciable expansion of thenational wealth.63. The measures in operation in Eire for the control of emigration havebeen under review by the Eire Government, and it has been decided to withdraw the embargo on the emigration of men from rural areas and towns with a popula-tion of 5,000 or under, and to replace them by a modified embargo which will affect only men resident in rural areas, that is, areas outside incorporated towns(comprising county boroughs, boroughs, urban districts and towns havingcommissioners). Until further notice, facilities to go to employment outsideEire will not be granted to any man whose normal place of residence is in a ruraldefined above, unless it can be shown that his normal employment duringthe last three years has been in an occupation other than agriculture or turfproduction, or that&apos; he is a migratory worker resident in the Western Countiesgoing to seasonal agricultural employment. The existing restrictions on the emigration of persons in employment or for whom suitable employment is avail-able and those who refuse suitable employment or lose it through circumstanceswithin their own control, persons under 22, members of the special register oragricultural and turf workers, and persons whose services may be deemed necessary &quot;in Eire, remain in force.64. Trade figures in November show that imports were valued at  2,326.852,and exports at  3,695,303, leaving an export surplus of  1,368,451. In November,1943, imports were valued at  2.639,754, and exports at  2,919,840, ah exportsurplus of  280,086.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State lor India.Political.65. Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru&apos;s &quot; Conciliation Committee,&quot; the formationof which was mentioned in the report for November, met and began its work at the end of December. Nationalist and non-party opinion generally welcomed the setting-up of the Committee, but the Moslem League press were hostile andMr. Jinnah refused to co-operate with it, as also did Dr. Ambedkar. The pro-ceedings are expected to last a couple of months.66. There is little else to report in the political field during December. for most of the month Mr. Gandhi was in voluntary retirement and for reasons ofhealth took a rest from all public activities, interviews and correspondence.67. There has been a certain breathing-space in the dispute between theGovernment of India and the Government of South Africa. While tension hasbeen eased by the reservation of Assent to the obnoxious Natal legislation (theResidential Property Qualification Ordinance) this relief has been offset by Field-Marshal Smuts&apos; announcement that the Pretoria agreement of April 1944
concurrently lapses and the situation reverts to the position after, the passingof the Pegging Act of April 1943. Further developments are hoped for as aresult of local consultations in South Africa.Indian States.68. Early in December, surprise was created by the announcement on the eve of a session of the Chamber of Princes that the session had been postponed,the Chancellor, the Vice-Chancellor, and the members of the Standing Committeehaving all announced their resignations. No definite explanation has yet beengiven by these Princes of their precipitate action. Several issues, such as thefuture of the smaller States and the honouring by the Crown of its treaty obliga-tions, have for some time been under discussion between the Viceroy and theChamber representatives, but the former&apos;s letter of the 2nd December, conveyingto the Chancellor his views on these matters contained nothing new in policy or principle which would account for the resignations. An authoritative explana-tion is still awaited, but it seems probable that a considerable number of the princes entertain fears that their economic independence may be threatened bythe reconstruction schemes of the Government of India, in which the co-operationof the States is required for the benefit of the country as a whole.Foreign and Frontier Relations.69. Afghanistan. Although the rebel Mazrak remained on the Afghanside of the frontier, the internal situation was quiet; interest in the other leadinghostile, &quot; the Malang,&quot; had practically evaporated.70. An Afghan military mission, composed of army and air force officers of high rank, has been visiting British military establishments in India. It isintended that they should also visit certain American establishments and forwardareas of the 14th Army. One of the objects of the mission is to study the kinds of arms and training best suited to Afghan conditions and the Government ofIndia have been authorised to make token offers of certain kinds of non-Lease-Lend equipment for use as samples, the intention being to increase the supply to meet Afghanistan&apos;s full requirements after the war with Japan.71. North-West Frontier. The Faqir of Ipi was quiescent, and the onlyserious disturbance this month was definitely contrary to his wishes. This was aborder dispute between Mahsuds and Wazirs. The trouble, which had beenbrewing for some time was brought to. a head by the cutting off by one tribe of theother&apos;s water supply. After the R.A.F. had delivered an ultimatum, thefortifications which had been constructed by both sides during the period of tension were destroyed. Rocket-firing aircraft played a prominent and effectivepart in these operations.72. Tibet. Sir Basil Gould spoke to the Tibetan authorities in the sense of the instructions described in last month&apos;s report and has now returned toIndia. It appears from the telegraphic reports so far received that the Tibetansreacted well to the rather guarded promise of diplomatic support in themaintenance of their autonomy and that they did not dispute the position wehave taken up in connection with the McMahon Line. Sir B. Gould was given a good send-off by the Tibetans and by Mr. Shen, the Chinese Delegate. Mr. Shen,with whom Sir B. Gould seems to have established cordial relations, expressed thehope that he might stay with him on his return to China via -India.73. Sinkiang. The situation is disturbed, but it is not clear whether thisis due to internal or external trouble. Qazak tribes from across the Russianfrontier have certainly been participating; one. of their raids is reported to havereached the region of Urumchi, the capital. The most serious fighting, however,is taking place in the North-West of the Province, where Mahomedan insurgentsbacked by alleged &quot; White Russians &quot; have broken into the large town of Kuldja.74. Persian Gulf. -For some time there had been reports of smugglingbeing carried on through the Qatar peninsula, and as a result of investigationscarried out by the British political authorities it recently became clear that these reports had a basis in fact, and that the Ruler&apos;s eldest son and relatives had beenencouraging smuggling to their own profit, quota goods being re-exported to persia and other ports on the Arab side of the Gulf, while the population ofQatar went short. The Ruler of Qatar has now been informed that, in order toensure a fair distribution of quota goods to his people, a system of rationing
under the control of the Political Agency at Bahrein will be introduced at Qatarand a representative of the Agency will take up his residence there to supervise,it: and further that ho allotment of quota goods would for the present be madeto the Ruler&apos;s immediate relatives and their families since it was clear that theywere already amply supplied.Economic.75. Civil Aviation. A delegation headed by Sir Girja Bajpai, the IndianAgent-General in Washington, represented India at the International CivilAviation Conference in Chicago, and also at the preliminary Conference of empire representatives in Montreal. The Indian delegation gave strong support to the United Kingdom delegation throughout. Owing to vote-catching activitiesby certain South American countries India was not elected to the Council of the interim International Organisation. The Norwegian representative thereuponoffered to give up Norway&apos;s place on the Council in favour of India. This shamedCuba into standing down instead, India being elected in Cuba&apos;s place.Naval, Military and A ir Force A activities.Royal Indian Navy.76.   H.D.M.L. 1112 was commissioned on the 6th December.77. H.M.I. Ships have been actively engaged in Convoy Escort dutiesthroughout the East Indies area.78. Coastal Forces were, active on the Arakan Coast, sweeps being carriedout as far south as Bassein, but except for an attack on three. M.L.S by two&quot; Lily &quot; bombers little enemy activity was encountered.79. A successful air-sea rescue was carried out during November when twoH.D.M.L.S rescued eleven of the crew of a &quot; Super Fortress &quot; which had been forced down into the sea in the Bav of Bengal.Military.80. &apos; Mediterranean. -Indian troops fought on both the 5th and 8th Armyfronts in Italy.81.   Some Indian troops were sent to Greece.82. Burma.-Progress throughout the month was marked. On the16th December the 4th Corps of the 14th Army, which had advanced eastwardsacross the Chindwin, linked up with the 36th British Division of the NorthernArea Combat Command advancing down the railway from Myitkyina. At thesame time the 4th Corps occupied a long stretch of the Myitkyina-Mandalayrailway to the South of that held by the 36th Division. By the end of the month the 4th Corps had reached Kabo 72 miles north-west of Mandalay and was approaching Ye-u.83. The 36th Division entered Tigyaing on the Irrawaddy 42 miles South ofKatha and put troops across the Irrawaddy from Katha.84. To the East Bhamo was captured. Chinese and an American TankForce met considerable opposition in the neighbourhood of Tonkwa, 45 miles southof Bhamo.85. Further east, Chinese troops advancing south-east from Bhamo reachedthe 52-milestone on the Bhamo-Namhkam road.86. In the Mytttha Valley west of the Chindwin irregular troops pushed far to the south through Gangaw, 80-miles south of Kalemyo, towards the sources ofthe Mytttha River.87. Practically the whole Mayu peninsula has been occupied; Foul Point,the southerly tip north of an east and west line through Donbaik, was reported tobe clear of the enemy. The advance down the peninsula was supported by ship-to-shore bombardments by Naval units.Air.88. Early in the month particular attention was paid to the Chindwinarea both in close support of ground troops and by bombing Japanese lines ofcommunication leading back to the Burmese railway system. Later, activityswitched to the Arakan, particularly between the Mayu and Kaladan rivers and
4 1 Ammfurther south at Akyab and Andrew Bay. In Central Burma there was extensivebombing of enemy airfields and of rail and road bridges. The Moulmein-Bangkok railway was successfully attacked on several occasions by long-range bombers and shipping and seaplanes were attacked near Victoria Point. GreatCoco Island, north of the Andamans, was twice raided by Liberators. East ofthe Chindwin the Japanese have abandoned much motor transport. In the dryweather Allied aircraft made daylight movement very difficult for the enemy.They also attacked by night, when most of his movement was taking place.General.89. Morale. -British troops&apos; morale remains high. Earlier reactions to thescheme for leave in the United Kingdom were somewhat sceptical, largely owingto doubts whether taking this leave would affect repatriation of the individualconcerned. Now that men have started to go the attitude is changing, but thereis a feeling that families at home do not realise its limitations and expecteveryone to get leave. Press announcements regarding voting, pay incrementsand one month&apos;s leave in the United Kingdom for British personnel of theIndian Army have been issued, but no comments are yet available. The sameapplies to pay increases for Indian troops.90. Short leave to United- Kingdom. The first party under the british service Scheme consisting of 50 officers and 450 B.O.Rs. left about mid-December.It has been agreed that a parallel scheme should be applied to British personnel of the Indian Army, but the difficulty is man-power. It has been recommendedthat a considerable proportion of air travel should be granted for both schemes,which, if agreed to, would go far towards solving the problem.91. Training. Kitchener College has been reorganised as an Inter-ServicesPre-Cadet College for training candidates, both service and civilian, who havebeen deferred by Selection Boards, for the Royal Indian Navy, Army and AirForce. The objects of the College are to develop initiative, personality and self-confidence, to teach English and to develop cadets physically.92. Bombay Port Reconstruction. The reconstruction of the North Quaywall of Victoria dock was completed, and two berths were handed over for cargoworking.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.Occupied Burma.. 93. It is reported that the Greater East Asia Conference Anniversary Day(the 6th November) was the occasion for mass meetings, with the usual speechesreaffirming loyalty to the Japanese. Such meetings have been necessary to reviveBurmese enthusiasm for independence which has recently waned somewhat.94. Burmans in the neighbourhood of Myitkyina last September werethinking of moving to Lower Burma on account of the behaviour of the Chinese.Passes to enter the area were being issued in China to Chinese civilians whostated that they were settling in it as it would become part of China.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot;Colonies&quot; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and.&quot; Colonial Governors.&quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)95. The Secretary of State left this country on the 27th December on ashort visit to Bermuda, the Bahamas, Jamaica and British Honduras. He expects to return via Washington by the 22nd January. The purpose of his tour is toenable him to see something of local conditions on the spot and to be present atthe inauguration of the new constitution in Jamaica.

- Economic Affairs.Lend I Lease and United Kingdom Exports.96. The revised arrangements for Lend/Lease recently discussed with theAmerican authorities and announced by the Prime Minister on the 30th Novemberpermitting of some relaxation in the restrictions on United Kingdom exports will,it is hoped, enable this country to supply the needs of the Colonies in certaindirections more freely than has been possible during the. last three years. Theattention of all Colonial Governors was drawn by circular telegram to the PrimeMinisters speech, and the Colonial Office is. now discussing with other Depart-ments means of making the new arrangements effective as quickly as possible.Textile supplies.97. The prospects of a deficiency in textile supplies are causing serious concern. This prospective deficiency arises from the large potential demands for the relief of Malaya and other Far East territories on their liberation on theone hand, and declining United Kingdom production coupled with the difficultyof obtaining increased supplies from the United States, India or other sourceson the other. This situation is now being examined by the Colonial Office andother claimant departments with the Ministry of Production and the Boardof Trade.Defence.98. Substantial&apos; advances have been made in Burma during the last month,against little opposition, by the East African troops between the Chindwin andIrrawaddy Rivers, and by the West African Troops in the Arakan.99. A large proportion of the men of the First Battalion, Fiji InfantryRegiment, were reported in December as unfit owing to malaria and otherdiseases.&quot; The battalion, at present in Fiji, served in very malarial areas in theSolomons for a considerable time. It is anticipated that the health of the battalion will be greatly improved in about three months.100. The West African Governments asked at the end of November thathealth authorities in this country should review measures to prevent theintroduction of cholera into West Africa by troops returning from the Far East.After discussion with the Resident Minister, before his departure to West Africa,the medical authorities of Service Departments and the India Office and theColonial Office Medical Adviser, it was decided that the measures already takenprovided reasonable safeguards against the introduction of the disease, but theWar Office medical authorities are recommending further measures of preventionto the appropriate authorities in the Far East.101. At the Prime Ministers request, a copy of his Directive on the morale and Welfare of Troops in the Far East was sent to the Governor of Ceylon for his information, with a request that he will do all he can to ensure the CeylonGovernments co-operation with the Service authorities, on whom the primary responsibility for the welfare of troops in Ceylon rests, in achieving the aims ofthis Directive.102. A further contingent of ground staff for the Royal Air Force, 1,935in number, has arrived from the West Indies and is in training in Yorkshire. Allthese recruits are Jamaicans and, with the exception of 600 who have been recommended for trade training, will become aircraft hands-general duties.Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.103. During the month the police have been very active in the suppression of the terrorist organisations. Apart from a leaflet campaign the terrorists havedone nothing. There are reports of continued extortion of funds from membersof the public by them. These cannot be confirmed but they probably have somefoundation. The police campaign has achieved substantial results, including the capture of several known terrorists and the seizure of a printing press run by theIrgun Zwai Leumi and of quantities of explosives. Fourteen more detainees were removed to Eritrea, where there are now 265 in all. The police have had a measureof co-operation in this campaign from the Jewish Agency.
104. Dr. Weizmann has been in Palestine throughout the month and his presence there has dominated the Jewish political scene. At a Joint Session ofthe Elected Assembly and of the Inner Zionist Council on the 5th December inthe presence of Dr. Weizmann resolutions were passed reaffirming the objectives of Agency-controlled immigration and settlement leading to a Jewish State inan unpartitioned Palestine. There was special emphasis on the rejection of partition.   The Session showed increased support for the Biltmore programme.105. At the present moment immigration in Palestine is limited to 1,500 amonth. During the month there was a large flow of immigrants from the Balkans,which aroused fears that the 1,500 maximum would be exceeded. It is not certain how far this immigration from the Balkans had been assisted by theJewish Agency, nor how far the Agency representatives in the Balkans are fully in contact with their representatives in Palestine. A team of Agency men headed by Ben Gurion have, during the month, been very active in Smyrna.106. During the month 158 Jews applied for membership of the. JewishBrigade, of whom 118 were accepted.107. Among the Arab population there has been a lull in internal political activities. There is no sign yet of a common programme or unified leadership.External activity has been left to Musa Alami, who more or less enjoys theconfidence of all as a non-committal explorer of Arab Unity avenues. Duringthe month he has had discussions with the Emir Abdullah, Nuri Pasha and other arab leaders regarding the Palestine Arab case generally, support of foreign capital for the National Fund and the proposal to establish Arab propagandacentres in the United Kingdom and the United States.

The European miners at Nchanga mine in Northern Rhodesia wenton strike on the 11th November. The strike was caused by a trivial incident,the appointment of a man to whom the Union objected to act temporarily asshift boss, but the strikers subsequently changed their ground and pressed for a revision of the agreement which had been.reached between the Union and the managements earlier in the, year as the result of conciliation proceedings. Asthe Managements were not prepared to concede the Union&apos;s demands and themen refused to come back, a complete deadlock was reached and the Companycame to the conclusion that they would have to close the mine if the men did not return by a specified date. On the 19th December, therefore, they asked the governors permission, under the Emergency Regulations covering man-powercontrol, for the discharge of their employees, which would be necessary in that event. On the Governor informing the Union on the 22nd December that hewould have no alternative but to give this permission, the men decided to returnto work and the strike has now ended.Ceylon.110.

Labour Situation. During the past two or three months the Colonyhas been going through a period of labour unrest and several strikes, one ofwhich affected the working of the dry dock and resulted in ships being held up.The position at one time threatened to become serious with the possibility ofa general strike developing.   All the strikes, however, have now been settled.Berm-uda.118. -&quot;The Governor has recently been on a visit to this country for discussionof matters of local interest, including (a) Income Tax, which has recently been rejected by the local legislature.(b) Labour Legislation, on which it is hoped that ythe Governor will be ableto persuade the local legislature to agree to make a start by theintroduction of Trade Board machinery, &amp;c./ amaica.119.
