THIS DOCUMENT IB THE PROPERTY OF HIS&apos;BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 78.2nd February, 1945.WAR CABINET.DISTRIBUTION OF INDUSTRY BILL.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.FOLLOWING a discussion on the 13th December, 1944 (W.M. (44)168th Conclusions, Minute 2), the War Cabinet authorised the drafting of aBill to carry out the proposals in my Memorandum W.P. (44) 640, subject tothe modifications indicated in the discussion, and invited me to bring this bill before the War Cabinet.   A draft Bill is now attached.2. I would direct the attention of my colleagues to the following points in particular : In Clause 1 the power to build, and to acquire land, is limited to the Develop-ment Areas.   This follows an undertaking I gave at the last Cabinet discussion.Clause 8, requiring notification to the Board of Trade of intended erectionor extension of industrial buildings (in excess of 3,000 square feet), likewisecarries out an undertaking I gave on the same occasion. I have struck out theproposed period of three months which was to have elapsed between notificationand the beginning of the work, unless- permission had already been obtained toproceed with the latter. No period at all is now inserted, and I must admit thatI am doubtful whether this clause in its latest form is really useful. I am advised that the information sought can, in fact, be obtained by the Board ofTrade from the Ministry of Town and Country Planning which, in turn, receivesit from the local Planning Authorities. It would lighten the Bill, and probablyspeed its passage, if this clause were dropped and, if my colleagues agree, I am prepared to drop it.3. The list of Development Areas to be included in the First Schedule- tothe Bill is attached as Annex. These four areas have already been approved bythe Distribution of Industry Committee at their meeting on the 3rd October last.Provision for subsequent amendment, whether by addition or subtraction, ismade in Clause 6 of the Bill.4. I ask my colleagues to agree that this Bill shall now go to the legislation committee, with a view to its introduction as soon as possible.H.
