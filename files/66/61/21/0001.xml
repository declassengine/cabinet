THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 66.27 th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.PUBLICATION OF THE WEST INDIA ROYAL COMMISSION REPORT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE War Cabinet decided on the 30th January, 1940 (W.M. (40)27th Conclusions), that, as then advised, they could not contemplate the publica-tion of the Report of the West India Royal Commission until after the end of thewar, since there was a danger that some of the criticisms which it made of british administration in the West Indies could be used by German propaganda,especially in the United States, with serious damage to our war effort.2. Clearly the report must be published some day and the risk of criticismis one which will then have to be faced. Under the very different conditionsobtaining to-day I see no reason to suppose that criticism would be more damaging if the report were published now than it would be at a later date:rather indeed the contrary. Some adverse comment would be inevitable at anytime, but most of the criticisms made by the Royal Commission were by implicationendorsed in a report of the Comptroller for Development and Welfare in the west indies which was published and debated in the House of Commons early in 1943.That report made no secret of the fact that there are still grave defects in thesocial services of the West Indies, and public opinion is not therefore likely tofind much that is both new and critical in the Royal Commission^ report.3. The present ban on publication is increasingly difficult to justify in theHouse of Commons and is administratively embarrassing. I consider that publication early this year is advisable, and can indeed be put to good use inpublicity both at home and overseas. - Publication would not involve any appreciable extra consumption of paper or use of labour since the original printedcopies are still available.4. I therefore invite the War Cabinet to agree that the report should bepublished early this year. If this is agreed I would propose at the same time to publish a White Paper setting out the steps which have been taken to carry outthe Commission^ recommendations. In addition, the report of the Comptrollerfor Development and Welfare for 1942-44 will be published early this year, andwill be cast in such a form as to cover the Royal Commission^ recommendationswithout referring in terms to them.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Informa-tion agree with my porposal.O. S.Colonial Office, 27th January, 1945.Copy No.[29132]
