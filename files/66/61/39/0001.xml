THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1945.Copy No.WAR CABINET.GRANT OF WAR GRATUITY TO WHOLE-TIME MEMBERS OF THECIVIL DEFENCE SERVICES.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE question of financial and other benefits for men and women released from full-time service in the Civil Defence Services was amongst the matters which the War Cabinet referred for examination by an Interdepartmental Com-mittee under the Chairmanship of the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to theMinistry of Labour and National Service. In the light of subsequent discussion between the Departments concerned, I am now reporting the matter to the WarCabinet for.decision on the main issues which are in dispute.2. The Home Office and associated Departments have put forward revised proposals that the basic grades in the whole-time. Civil Defence Services shouldreceive in respect of their wTar service, a lump-sum gratuity at the same rates aswill be applied to privates in the Army, viz., 10s. a month in the case of men and6s. 8d. a month in the case of women, but with no additional benefits correspond-ing to the release leave to be granted to members of the Armed Forces. Thegrounds on which these proposals are made are briefly that the pay and conditionsof service of Civil Defence personnel have throughout been equated as nearly aspossible with those of the private soldier, that the value of the services rendered to the war effort have been comparable with those rendered by the Armed forces and their auxiliaries, that in the earlier stages of recruitment promises of treat-ment equivalent to that of the Army were given, and that latterly recruits havebeen drawn through the Military Service Acts.3. The Service Departments do not object in principle to a gratuity for civil Defence Service provided nothing is given in addition in the way of leaveor other benefits. In this form the proposal is also acceptable to the Ministry ofLabour and National Service. I understand, however, that the Service Depart-ments are of the opinion that, in order not to provoke dissatisfaction with the rateof gratuity given to the Forces, the rate of gratuity for Civil Defence service should be somewhat lower.4. My own view is that the case for a gratuity to full-time Civil Defencemembers cannot be resisted. I assume of course that the Civil Defence scheme would conform in its general lines with the Armed Forces scheme and that noactual issues of gratuity Would be made to Civil Defence personnel in advance ofthe start of issues to the Armed Forces. The amount of the gratuity is open to question. On the one hand such a reward, even if it were payable at the full rateof the Armed Forces war gratuity, would not approach the value of the totalbenefits accruing to a member of the Forces under the general release scheme. Onthe other hand, it may be thought that the Forces themselves would tend to take account only of the lump-sum payments between which there would be a directcomparison. Moreover, the effect would be to place a member of the Forces whowas discharged before the inception of the general release scheme (and who willconsequently not receive any benefits by way of release leave) on an exact equalityin the matter of cash benefits with the Civil Defence worker of similar rank and service. A question for the Cabinet to decide is whether the gratuity should beat the full rate of the Forces&apos; gratuity, as proposed by the Ministers responsiblefor the Civil Defence Services, or at a somewhat reduced rate, say two-thirds, asproposed by the War Office, or five-sixths, which would be acceptable to the[29203]SECRET.W.P. (45) 84.7th February, 1945.
Admiralty and Air Ministry. As a former Minister of Home Security, myopinion may not be thought to be unbiased, but for my own part I do not see anysufficient ground for differentiation.5. For ranks other than officer ranks above the basic grade higher rates ofgratuity are proposed corresponding to the non-commissioned and warrant ranks in the Army. The primary division between these will be according to pay(excluding service pay) and the general effect in the various Civil Defence services is set out in Appendix I. The amounts are shown on the basis that Civil Defenceworkers will have the same rates of gratuity as the Armed Forces. If lower rates are fixed for Civil Defence the scales would require adjustment throughout. Ishould add that in the application of the formula to&quot; the Royal Observer Corpsthe Air Ministry take the view that the status and the responsibilities of LeadingObservers and Chief Observers are such as to equate them with the Army Corporaland Sergeant respectively. Their weekly rates of pay, however, qualify them on the basis applied to the Civil Defence Services generally, only for a ratecorresponding to that of the Army private. It would in my view prejudice thegeneral formula for the Civil Defence Services as a whole to waive the paycriterion in favour of one small section, and I feel justified therefore in inviting the Secretary of State for Air to accept the rates suggested in Table 5 for royal observer Corps &quot; other ranks.&quot;6. The treatment of the officer. grades presents some difficulty. In theNational Fire Service a standard hierarchy of officer ranks has been built up fromthe basic grades and it is proposed that these should receive gratuity.at the rateappropriate to the Commissioned rank regarded as comparable in the Army,determined broadly on a salary basis. A Table setting out the comparisons isgiven in Appendix II. There are no officer grades in the Police War Reservewho serve under the direction of regular police officers. There are a few officersin Civil Defence mobile units on rates of pay specially prescribed for this civil defence duty who can conveniently be fitted into the scheme for officers as outlinedfor the National Fire Service. For the most part, however, the directing staff ofthe Civil Defence general services is found from the officers of the local authorities.These officers, though perhaps full-time on Civil Defence duties, continue inreceipt of their local authority rates of pay, including war bonus where applicable.Following the general principle laid down for the Forces gratuities that service on civil rates of pay as opposed to Service pay does not count, such local authorityofficers have been excluded from the Civil Defence gratuity scheme.7. The position of Royal Observer Corps officers is not quite so clear. TheAir Ministry claim on their behalf that their duties and responsibilities, whichare of an operational character, justify the grant of gratuities as agreed for officers of the N.F.S. and Civil Defence mobile units. They consider that itwould cause resentment if the gratuity scheme which is being applied to the rank and file were not extended to the officers of the Corps. On the other hand the Royal Observer Corps officers are paid salaries on a civilian basis, attractingCivil Service war bonus and their constitutional position is that of TemporaryCivil Servants. It seems very difficult to distinguish their case from that ofother civilians who wear service uniform with or without Service commissions,such as R.A.F. Education officers, Army Audit staff, Land Agents, &amp;c, NavalStore, Armament Supply, &amp;c, Officers, and so on. More particularly, there isthe position of officers and men serving on T. 124 agreements. These are carryingout the. full range of Naval duties, including combatant duties, but being on civil (merchant navy) rates of pay will not be eligible for war gratuity.8.   The points which the War Cabinet are invited to decide are therefore :(1) Should the Civil Defence Services receive gratuities in respect of whole-time service on the general lines approved for the Armed Forces ?(2) If so, should the rates of Civil Defence gratuity equal the Armed Forces&apos;rates or be somewhat lower, e.g. two-thirds or five-sixths?(3) Should Royal Observer Corps officers be treated like officers of the N.F.S.and Civil Defence mobile units, or should they be debarred fromgratuity in consequence of their being remunerated on an ordinarycivilian basis?Treasury Chambers, Whitehall, S.W.1,7th February, 1945.J.
