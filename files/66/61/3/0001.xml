\THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT-. -      - -- - -       ---------     &quot;       ^&quot;Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 48.23rd January, 1945.WAR CABINET.POLAND&apos;S  WESTERN FRONTIER.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I append (Annex I) a statement of the various indications of the attitudeof His Majesty&apos;s Government which have been given from time to time, eitherpublicly or in the course of discussions with the Soviet and Polish Governments,upon the question of the transfer of German territories to Poland after the war.(A sketch map of the regions in question is also annexed.) The general effect ofthese declarations is as follows : (i) We are committed to support the principle that, on the assumption that poland will be called upon to cede to Soviet Russia territory up tothe Curzon line in the east, she should receive in return, as part ofa general settlement involving appropriate guarantees of her inde-pendence from the Great Powers, German territories from which theGerman populations would be evicted.(ii) We have committed ourselves to support in these circumstances thetransfer to Poland of Danzig, East Prussia west and south ofKonigsberg and (in private discussions though not in public state-ments) the Oppeln district of Silesia,(iii) We have agreed in general terms though without committing ourselves to support the transfer to Poland of any specified territories addi-tional to those referred to in (ii) that Poland shall have the rightto claim any further territories she may desire to acquire up to theline of the Oder including the port of Stettin.2. I have always considered that a case could be sustained for the acquisi-tion by Poland of the territories mentioned in paragraph 1 (ii) above, with thepossible addition of a small corner of^territory in the eastern tip of Pomerania.I have, however, on many occasions in the course of my discussions with PolishMinisters on this question warned the Polish Government in their own interestsagainst claiming extensive territories beyond these limits, which Poland wouldhave difficulty in absorbing. Most of the more reasonable Poles in London are well aware of these dangers.3. The undertakings which we have in the past given to the Polish Govern-ment in regard to their western frontiers were given in the course of our attempts to induce the Polish Government to accept the Curzon line as the basis for asettlement with Soviet Russia in the east. As a result of recent events, however,it is now far more probable that it will be with the claims of the Lublin Poles,backed by the Russians, that we shall have to deal. Since the Lublin Poles are ready to accept the Curzon line anyhow, there is no longer any need for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to support more extensive transfers of German territorythan we think convenient and proper on other grounds.4. There are the following further reasons for keeping the position asfluid as possible and confining ourselves to our present commitments :  (i) Recent statements from Lublin and Moscow make it clear that theclaims of the Lublin Poles will be very extensive. It appears thatthey now consider that their future frontier with Germany should12646   [29096] . . B
follow the line of the Eiver Oder and its tributary the Gorlitzer Neisse(the more westerly of two tributaries of this name) which flowsdue north from the Czechoslovak frontier and joins the Oder southof Frankfurt on the Oder. This would give Poland considerableterritory beyond the Oder instead of merely up to the Oderas originally proposed by Stalin. A recent article in Pravdahas supported the Lublin claim to this frontier and it may be presumed,that the Russians consider that they have an interest in pushingPoland as far to the west as possible, thus embroiling her permanentlywith Germany and making her dependent upon Soviet support and protection.(ii) It. is known that the French Provisional Government at the time ofGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s recent visit to Moscow made no objection to theextension of the Polish frontier &quot; to the Oder.&quot; The French arekeenly interested in depriving Germany of control over the Rhinelandand the Rheno-Westphalian Basin. They are doubtless tempted to acquiesce in any claims which the Russians may encourage the Polesto put forward against German territory in the east in the hope ofgaining Russian support for their own proposals.(iii) The House of Commons debate on Poland on the 15th December and subsequent comment in the British press have confirmed that publicopinion in this country is already uneasy about the proposal thatGermany should be required to cede large territories to Poland afterthe war and that the German population should be evicted from these areas. This being so, it is unlikely that British public opinion would&apos;whole-heartedly support at the Peace Conference Stalin&apos;s original proposal and still less the extravagant frontier now advocated byLublin. Even less would it be willing to make any sacrifices inorder to maintain in later years Polish sovereignty over territories which have been German-owned and German-inhabited for hundreds of years. German propaganda may be relied upon to exploit any suchdoubt and uncertainty in British opinion and there will accordingly. be a serious risk that by imposing extreme solutions of the Polishproblem we should weaken our own will to enforce the whole Germansettlement.(iv) By entering into specific commitments now about Poland&apos;s westernfrontier the major Allies would be in danger of prejudicing in advancemany other aspects of the general German settlement. The easternfrontiers of Germany cannot be fixed in isolation from her westernfrontiers and the frontier settlements will also react upon the wholeeconomic settlement which it will be desired to impose upon Germany,in regard to which rio final decisions have yet been taken. In a recenttelegram from Washington the Minister of State has reported that president Roosevelt expressed to him the conviction that it was most unwise to attempt to come now to any long-term decisions aboutGermany. The United States Government have carefully refrained from committing themselves to support of any specific Polish claims to German territory and the possibility of Poland receiving territorialcompensation at the expense of Germany for lands ceded to SovietRussia in the East was not mentioned in the statement on Polandissued by Mr. Stettinius on the 18th December, 1944.(v) From the Polish point of view also it  b undesirable to deal with thequestion of her western frontiers in isolation. We should be wise toreach no final decision on this question until we had some idea of the.Polish State that will emerge from the war and know what its relations with the major Allied Powers will be. Polish opinion inLondon, and probably in Poland too, is divided upon the westernfrontier problem. Most Poles agree in regarding the Oder as Poland&apos;snatural line of security against Germany, in the sense that Frenchmenlook upon the Rhine, and some of them are now inclined to argue that, if Poland is to lose Lwow as well as Vilna and is not to acquireKonigsberg, she should receive Stettin and Breslau. Importantsections of informed Polish opinion are, however, opposed to theextension of Polish territory as far as the Oder, and the presentPolish Prime Minister has announced publicly that his government do not demand more than Danzig, East Prussia, Upper Silesia and parts of Pomerania, and do not want Breslau or Stettin.   The reasons
for this abnegation are partly distrust of Soviet motives in encouraging exaggerated Polish pretensions and partly doubt as tothe capacity of Poland after the war to absorb and populate such large German-inhabited territories without weakening herself or having to rely on Soviet &quot;military strength to maintain her holdsuccessfully against German agitation and pressure. There is good reason for such doubts and, inasmuch as our commitments and our interests alike demand that the future Poland shall be able to standon her own feet and thus contribute to the stability of Central Europe,we should, where possible, encourage the moderate Poles to resist the pressure of the extremists in this matter,(vi) If the German populations are to be expelled from the territoriesacquired by Poland, the annexation by Poland of all the territorynorth of Oppeln which lies east of the Oder, leaving the towns ofBreslau and Stettin in Germany, would involve the moving of some\ million Germans additional to the 2\ million who will in any case have to be expelled from pre-war Poland, East Prussia, Danzig andOppeln Silesia. If the extreme Lublin claims were met (seeparagraph 4 (1) above), including the port and neighbourhood ofStettin, a further 3^ million would have to be moved, making a grandtotal of about 8 million. This would so increase the scale of analready extremely difficult problem of transfer and resettlement asto involve a serious risk of complete breakdown of all transferarrangements.5. Since His Majesty&apos;s Government have never expressed a clear and positive view as to Poland&apos;s western frontier there is a danger lest the SovietGovernment might choose to regard our silence on the subject as constitutingtacit acquiescence in their views. While we should clearly not commit ourselvesnow in such a way as to pre-judge the future settlement. I think that the time has come to make clear to our principal Allies that we have doubts on the subject and must not be regarded as committed to the support of any annexation byPoland beyond those of East Prussia, Danzig and the Oppeln district.6. So far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are concerned, I would suggestthat our line might be that His Majesty&apos;s Government must not be considered as having accepted any definite line as a western frontier of Poland. Theyconsider, however, that this problem, affecting as it does other aspects of long-term policy towards Germany apart from its specifically Polish aspect, is asuitable one for examination by the European Advisory Commission in accordancewith the procedure suggested in Foreign Office telegrams No. 13 to Paris(paragraph 3) and No. 356 to Washington, of which copies are attached(Annexes II and III).- A. E.Foreign Office, January 23, 1945.annex I.Statements of the attitude af His Majesty&apos;s Government concerning the cession of German territory to Poland.1. Formula proposed by the Prime Minister at the Teheran Conferencein December 1943 as a broad outline of the settlement of the Polish questionwhich should be aimed at: &apos;&apos; It was thought in principle that the whole of the Polish State and thenation should be between the so-called Curzon line and the line of the Oderincluding for Poland, East Prussia (as defined) and Oppeln; but the actualtracing of the frontier line required careful study and possible disentangle-ment of population at some point.&quot;[29096] b 2
2. Extract from speech by Prime Minister in House of Commons on the22nd February, 1944 : &quot; (At Teheran) Marshal Stalin and I also spoke and agreed upon theneed for Poland to obtain (territorial) compensation at the expense ofGermany both in the north and in the west.&quot;3. Extract from draft declaration prepared in consultation with the PolishPrime Minister at the Moscow Conference in October 1944 as a statement of theviews of the British and Soviet Governments concerning a general settlement ofthe Polish question : &quot; Upon the unconditional surrender of Germany, the territory of Polandin the West will include the free city of Danzig, the regions of East Prussiawest and south of Konigsberg, the administrative district of Oppeln inSilesia, and the lands desired by Poland to the east of the line of the Oder.It is further agreed that possession of these territories shall be guaranteedto Poland by the Soviet and British Governments. It is understood that theGermans in the said regions shall be repatriated to Germany and that allPoles in Germany shall at their wish be repatriated to Poland.&quot;4. Extract from letter from Sir Alexander Cadogan to the Polish Ministerfor Foreign Affairs, dated the 2nd November, 1944 :  &quot; You asked in the first place whether, even in the event of the UnitedStates Government finding themselves unable to agree to the changes in thewestern frontier of Poland foreshadowed in the recent conversations in moscow, His Majesty&apos;s Government would still advocate these changes atthe Peace Settlement. The answer of His Majesty&apos;s Government to thisquestion is in the affirmative.&quot; Secondly, you enquired whether His Majesty&apos;s Government weredefinitely in favour of advancing the Polish frontier up to the line of theOder,.to include the port of Stettin. The answer is that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment do consider that Poland should have the right to extend her territory to this extent.&quot;5. Extract from speech by the Prime Minister in the House of commons on the 15th December, 1944 : &quot; I cannot accept the view that the arrangements which have to be proposed about the frontiers of the new Poland are not solid and satisfactory,or that they would not give to Poland that &apos; abiding home&apos; of which I spoke tothe House in February. If Poland concedes Lwow and the surroundingregions in the South, on the line known as Curzon Line A, which my right honourable Friend the Foreign Secretary will deal with in more detail later on in the Debate if Poland makes this concession and these lands are joinedto the Ukraine, she will gain in the North the whole of East Prussia west and south of the fortress of Konigsberg, including the great city and port,of Danzig, one of the most magnificent cities and harbours in the whole ofthe world, famous for centuries as a great gathering place of the trade ofthe Baltic, and, indeed/ of the world. This will be hers instead of the threatened and artificial Corridor, which was built so laboriously after thelast war, and Poland will stretch broadly along the Baltic on a front of over200 miles. The Poles are free, so far as Russia and Great Britain areconcerned, to extend their territory, at the expense of Germany, to the West.I do not propose to go into exact details, but the extensions, which will be supported by Britain and Russia, bound together as they are by the 20 years&apos;alliance, are of high importance. Thus, they gain in the West and the Northterritories more important and more highly developed than they lose inthe East. We hear that a third of Poland is to be ceded, but I must mention that that third includes the vast track of the Pripet Marshes, a most desolateregion, which, though it swells the acreage, does &quot;not add to the wealth ofthose who own it.Thus I have set before the House what is, in outline, the offer whichthe Russians, on whom the main burden of liberation still falls, make to thePolish people. I cannot believe that such an offer should be rejected byPoland. It would, of course, have to be accompanied by the disentanglementof populations in the East and in the North. The transference of severalmillions of people would have to be effected from the East to the West or. North, as well as the expulsion of the Germans because that is what isproposed : the total expulsion of the Germans from the area to be acquired
by Poland in the West and the North. For expulsion is the method which,so far as we have been able to see, will be the most satisfactory and lasting;There will be no mixture of populations to cause endless trouble, as hasbeen the case in Alsace-Lorraine. A clean sweep will be made. I am notalarmed by the prospect of the disentanglement of populations, nor evenby these large transferences, which are more possible in modern conditionsthan they ever were before.ANNEX   II.Mr. Eden to Mr. Duff Cooper (Paris).(No. 13.   Important.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, 3rd January, 1945.MY immediately preceding telegram.I do not much-like the French attitude as disclosed by M. Massigli&apos;s remarks.Their^explanations about the Franco-Soviet Treaty are far from convincing andthe excuse for their behaviour over Poland is, to say the least, pretty feeble. Asregards the German question, their attitude gives the impression that they think they know where they stand with the &quot;Russians and that this fortifies them in.insisting upon reaching agreement with us before they will condescend to enterinto a treaty. It seems, however, that they may be over-playing their hand, sinceall our information suggests that the French did most of the balking at Moscowabout Germany, and that the Russians confined themselves to agreeing upon thegeneral necessity of destroying German power to renew aggression.2. We are certainly not beggars for a French treaty, and if the French try to cast us for that role they will need a jolt. We can let matters take their course, but in the meantime it is essential that nothing should be said or done which might give the French the impression that we were soliciting a treaty with them or making any sort of approach to them on the subject.3. As regards the question of procedure for dealing with German questions,M. Massigli is wrong in suggesting that questions such as his own scheme for permanent control over &apos;&apos; Rheno-Westphalia &apos;&apos; are outside the terms of reference of the European Advisory Commission. The Commission^ terms of reference were deliberately made very wide and covered &quot;European questions connectedwith the termination of hostilities which the three Governments may consider appropriate to refer to it.&quot; Furthermore, it was agreed at the moscow conference in October 1943 that the whole question of the treatment ofGermany after the armistice should be referred for detailed study to theCommission. It was, however, provided that the Commission should give special priority to the terms of surrender and the machinery of control, upon which ithas in fact already made recommendations. At the Tehran Conference inDecember 1943 it was decided to refer to the Commission the question of dis-membering Germany, and this has already been brought up in the Commission bythe United Kingdom representative (as M. Massigli must be aware from theCommission^ papers communicated to him), although nothing has so far beendone as the Soviet representative expressed himself at the time as unable to dealwith the matter. The competence and suitability of the Commission for iadvisingGovernments on these German questions was made quite clear by me during the conversations with the French at Paris in November last. If occasion arises you should put M. Bidault right on the point dealt with in the present paragraph,provided that this can be ,done without giving the impression referred to inparagraph 2 above.&apos; ANNEX III.Mr. Eden to the Earl of Halifax (Washington).(No. 356.)   (Moscow, No. 166.) Foreign Office,(Telegraphic.) 12^A January, 1945.MY telegram No. 13 to Paris [of 3rd January : question of an Anglo-Frenchtreaty], paragraph 3.You will have seen from paragraph 6 of my telegram No. 25 to Paris [of6th January] that M. Massigli subsequently made it plain to me that the Frenchreluctance to use the European Advisory Commission as the forum for exchangingAllied views on long-term policy towards Germany derives from their concernat the slowness with which the Commission works.
2. It seems to me essential, however, that we should have and use inter-Allied machinery of the. character of the E.A.C. to prepare the way for thedecisibns on this question which will, of course, have to be taken at the highest level. Our own internal studies of the long-term German problems have shownhow complex they are and how difficult it is to decide upon the best way ofattaining the common objective that Germany shall never again be able to embark upon aggression. It seems essential that before any.final decisions are taken by governments, these problems should be fully debated between the major Alliesso that the various alternatives, and their pros and cons, can be submitted to governments as the raw material for the necessary high-level decisions.3. Without this preliminary inter-Allied study it is difficult to see howsatisfactory and lasting decisions can ever be taken. The major Allies are agreedupon the broad objectives the destruction of German power to make war and proper retribution upon Germany for her crimes against the Allies but thereare an ever-increasing number of alternative ways of reaching these objectives.The decision between the various alternatives invariably depends upon intricatequestions of detail geographical, political, military and economic -which shouldbe thoroughly studied before, heads of Governments are asked to give a finaldecision on them.4. For example, it is generally agreed that some form of permanent control should be established over German industrial war potential in the Ruhr-Rhinearea; but when it comes to deciding how this should be done, we are confronted with alternatives ranging from the suggestion to turn the area into a pastoralcommunity, to the idea of setting up some form of separate State under allied control whose industry would be made to work as hard, as possible to repair the damage done to the Allied countries.5. It is still our belief that the European Advisory Commission is theright body to devil these very difficult questions for Governments. It would beabsurd to decide not to use the Commission, and then to have to set up an almostparallel inter-Allied body for the purpose. Moreover, the Commission, as atpresent constituted, has the great advantage that it includes the French on an equal footing, which is essential if any lasting plans are to be made aboutGermany. This point is very important precisely because the French have not hitherto been included in the high-level inter-Allied meetings.6. It is true that the European Advisory Commission has hitherto workedslowly, although, as M. Massigli generously admitted, this is certainly not the fault of the British representative. But surely the remedy is to reform theworkings of the Commission and not to duplicate it, or to attempt (as M. Massiglisuggested) the impossible task of discussing these complicated problems by diplo-matic correspondence.7. In addition to the steps already taken, as summarised in paragraph 3of my telegram No. 13 to Paris, to bring long-term German policy before theCommission, both the United States and the Soviet Governments have proposed the reference to the Commission of specific aspects of the problem. The Americansuggestion that reparation and economic security should be studied under the aegis of the Commission is already under consideration. In October last theSoviet representative submitted a plan of work for the Commission which includedtwo major questions of long-term character, viz., the abolition of the &quot; Hitleriteregime &apos;&apos; and control over German economy.8. This question of machinery and procedure for studying the questionof long-term policy towards Germany is one which it will be essential to discussat the next high-level meeting. But it would, I think, be helpful if the Govern-ments concerned were each reflect upon the matter before the meeting takes place.I should, therefore, be glad if you would take an early opportunity to speak toMr. Stettinius, M. Molotov on the lines of this telegram and to tell them that Imuch hope that they will share my view and be able to study the question beforethe next meeting.
