THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  January 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 65.261h January, 1945.WAR CABINET.RELEASE FROM HIS MAJESTY&apos;S FORCES, CIVIL DEFENCE ANDINDUSTRY OF CANDIDATES FOR PARLIAMENT AND FULL-TIME PARTY AGENTS, ORGANISERS AND OFFICIALS.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.1. In accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet on the 11thDecember, (W.M. (44) 164th Conclusions, paragraph 5), I arranged a meeting with the Service Ministers, the Chief Whip and representatives of the four mainParty organisations. As a result of this discussion. I am now able to submit the revised proposals set out in the Annex to this Memorandum.2. These proposals have the approval of the main Party organisations,except that the Conservative and Labour Party representatives contend thatformer constituency agents who are now wanted for headquarters and regional offices should be eligible for release from the Forces (paragraph 5 of Annex).I do not consider that this contention should receive more than qualifiedacceptance.3. If the proposals are approved, it will be necessary to decide when theyshould come into operation. I suggest that applications for facilities to begranted to prospective candidates and applications for the release of full-timeagents, organisers and officials should be entertained as soon as the scheme is approved and the necessary arrangements have been made for dealing with the applications.4. It is proposed in paragraph 3 of the Annex that adopted candidatesshould be temporarily released in adequate time for the Election. It is assumed that they could not, in any event, be released before the date of the announcementof the Dissolution of Parliament, and as this will be at least 38 days beforepolling day, it is suggested that releases should begin immediately the announce-ment has been made.5. Applications for release or posting home will no doubt be made bymembers of the Forces who wish to stand for Parliament as Independents. Itwill be very difficult to judge the merits of these applications, and I should be grateful for the views of my colleagues on the principles to be adopted.6. I shall be glad to receive the approval of my colleagues to the proposals set out in the Annex as soon as possible.(Initialled) E. B.Ministry of labour and National Service, S.W. 1,26th January, 1945.[29128]
ANNEX.I. Potential Candidates.1. Subject to overriding military considerations, potential candidates onthe short list who are serving in the Forces should be granted adequate facilities(including, if necessary, short special leave) to enable them to appear personallybefore the selection committee of their prospective constituencies.2. Applications for such facilities to be given to candidates on the shortlist would be made by Party headquarters to the Ministry of Labour and NationalService and would indicate when the selection committee would meet. With theassistance, as necessary, of a small committee consisting of representatives of thefour main Party organisations, the Ministry of Labour and National service would decide whether or not to recommend to the Service Departments that facilities be granted. If a favourable recommendation were made, the service departments would take the necessary steps to bring the candidate back to thiscountry if he were overseas, but only normal travelling facilities would be used.The Service Department would tell the Party headquarters when the man inquestion was likely to be available.II.-Adopted Candidates.3. Adopted candidates should be temporarily released in adequate time before tbe Election. To enable this to be done, candidates who have already beenadopted and are serving in or within easy reach of this country, including thoseselected under the arrangements in paragraph 2 above, should not be sent to more -distant Commands pending the Election. Subject to the exigencies of the Service,adopted candidates serving in distant Commands should be brought home as soonas possible. If not elected to Parliament, adopted candidates would be recalledto the Forces.III. Full-time Agents, Organisers and Officials.4.   There should be early release from the Forces, Civil Defence Servicesand industry of (a) recognised constituency agents or organisers irrespective of the basis oftheir remuneration and whether they are to serve in the constituencyto which they were previously attached or in some Otherconstituency; and(b) the key staff of headquarters and regional offices of political parties.Release from the Forces would be subject to overriding military caonsiderations and to the individual&apos;s consent.5. So far as releases from the Forces and Civil Defence Services areconcerned, persons who were formerly part-time or honorary agents would not be excluded if they were now required as full-time agents. In such cases it wouldhave to be established that the persons were, in fact, formerly part-time orhonorary agents. Persons who had not been agents before would, however, be excluded, and former constituency agents who were now wanted for headquarters and regional offices would not be eligible for release unless they are posted at homeand can easily be spared.6. Release from industry would be easier to arrange and the conditions governing releases from the Forces would not necessarily apply provided theindividual concerned was required for full-time employment. The cases wouldbe considered by the Ministry of Labour and National Service on their merits.7. Applications would be made by Party headquarters to.the Ministry ofLabour and National Service, which would be assisted as necessary by thecommittee mentioned in paragraph 2 above in making recommendations to theService Departments. )8. Agents, organisers and officials would be liable to recall to the Forces ifthey did not perform the work for which they had been released, and would in any event be subject to recall after the Election.
IV. Indian Army and Navy.9. Officers and men of the Royal Indian Navy, Indian Army and IndianAir Force should be given the same facilities as those in the United kingdom forces.V. Small Parties.10. The rules set out above will apply to the smaller parties as well as tothe main parties, but, in addition, the Ministry of Labour and National Servicemust be satisfied in any particular case that a selected candidate genuinelyintends to contest the seat and that any agent applied for is wanted for a constituency which the party intends to contest.VI. Independents.11. It would not be possible to post home or to release men in the Forcesmerely because they announce their intention of standing as Independentcandidates. It will be necessary to devise some method for deciding whichapplications are genuine.VII. Temporary Civil Servants.12. Temporary Civil Servants wishing to become Parliamentary candidatesshould be permitted to appear before a selection committee and, if necessary, to address a subsequent &quot; adoption meeting &quot; whether held in public or not. Theyshould not be permitted to appear again on any political platform or take partin any political activity or propaganda while they remain in the Civil Service.If adopted they should resign from the Civil Service at a date not later than thedate of the announcement that a General Election is to take place, and theirresignation will be final.VIII. Northern Ireland.13. The above proposals will cover the Election in Northern Ireland for the-Imperial Parliament, and similar arrangements will have to be made for theGeneral Election to the Northern Ireland Parliament.IX. Emergency Arrangements.. 1.4. Special emergency arrangements would have to be made if the Electionwere to take place at an unexpectedly early date.
