(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT AM IC MaJE^YjS GOVERpfejENT)SECRET34YAP. (45) 95 &apos; COPY NO..12th February, 1945WAR cabinet war GRATUITIES AMD THE WOMEN1 S LAND AKlviTNoto by tho Secretary of State for ScotlandVI concur in tho views expressed by tho Minister of Agriculture/in W* *(45)88 in asking the Cabinet to give tho most sympatheticI consideration to tho proposal that members of the Women&apos;s Land Army(should be awarded a war gratuity comparable to that given to theWomen&apos;s Auxiliary Services, but without the period of leave with full pay that women in those services are to receive.I am now endeavouring to obtain an additional 3,500reoruits for the- Women.&apos;.s Land .army in Scotland..   Publicity measures for the purpose have boon set on foot, but it is already apparent that this propaganda is being muffed by representations appearing in the Press against the failure of the Government so far to promise equitable treatment to serving members of the- Women&apos;s land Army in tho matter of benefits on disbandmont.    I am satisfiedthat nothing less than an early announcement on this mat tor in afavourable sense will enable us to obtain the required number ofadditional recruits.In default of a favourable decision to grant war gratuities to members of tho Women&apos;s Land .&apos;jrmy I would support the Minister1 salternative proposals for (a), further contributions to tho Women&apos;s land Army Benevolent Funds, (b) the award of a clothing grant andmobility grant.T.J.Scottish Office.12th February,&apos; 1945.
