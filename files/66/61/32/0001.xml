Report on the Deliberations of the Joint Committee on Lend-Lease appointed bythe President and the Prime Minister at the Quebec Conference.1. As the result of discussions at the Quebec Conference a Joint (Combined)Committee was set up to consider the problems of Lend-Lease supplies to theBritish Empire in Stage II. The representatives on the United States side wereMr. Morgenthau, Secretary of the United States Treasury (in the Chair), assisted by Mr. H. White; Mr. Stettinius, then Assistant Secretary in the State Depart-ment, assisted by Mr. Dean Acheson; Mr. Crowley, Foreign EconomicAdministrator, assisted by Mr. Lauchlin Currie. and Mr. Oscar Cox.Mr. Patterson, Under-Secretary in the War Department, and Mr. Gates,Assistant Secretary in the Navy Department, were present when questions ofmunitions supplies concerning their Departments were under discussion. Onthe British side, those ordinarily present were Lord Halifax, Lord Cherwell(for the period that he was in Washington), Mr. Ben Smith, Lord Keynes,Sir Robert Sinclair, Sir Henry Self, Mr. R. H. Brand and Mr. Opie. Mr. F. Coe,of F.E.A., and Mr. F. Lee, of the British Treasury Delegation, acted asSecretaries.*2. The Committee were directed to agree and recommend to the Heads oftheir respective Governments the amount of Mutual Aid in Munitions, Non-Munitions, and Services which is to be provided for the most effective prosecution of the war in its second stage, that is, after the defeat of Germany and duringthe war with Japan. They were further instructed in reaching their conclusions to be guided by the conversation between the President and the Prime minister on the 14th September, 1944 (see Appendices, pp. 4-5).3. The United Kingdom representatives submitted a full statement of their economic and financial position as relating to the fulfilment of their obligations in Stage II, which has been circulated as W.P. (44) 586, and against this back-ground their estimated needs under Lend-Lease of Munitions, Non-Munitions,and Services were discussed in detail with the United States Agencies concerned.The agreements reached are summarised below : as to- Munitions Chapter I;as to Non-Munitions and Services Chapter II; and as to direct LendJ^easeSupplies to the Dominions and India Chapter IV.4. Since it is necessary that in Stage II some part of the resources of theUnited Kingdom should be devoted to repairing the ravages of war, particularlyin regard to housing and making good some of the arrears of industrial main-tenance and to the provision of some easement of civil standards; and since it hadbeen accepted as part of the agreed Record of the Quebec Conversations that conditions should not be attached to supplies delivered to Britain on Lend-Leasewhich would jeopardise recovery of her export trade, the export arrangements which should operate as the end of the war with Germany approaches were also discussed. Chapter V describes the agreement that has been reached under this heading.5. The United Kingdom representatives also put forward for consideration a series of proposals for easing the financial burden on this country. these included suggestions partly for the restoration of Lend-Lease terms to certainsupplies which had been taken off the Lend-Lease list, and partly for the revival of certain claims which had previously been held in suspense. The results are summarised in Chapter III.(Signed) KEYNES.R. J. SINCLAIR.January, 1945.* Those principally concerned in the detailed work of the negotiations in Washington included the following: British Treasury and Treasury Delegation in Washington, Lord Keynes, Mr. R.

3illsCHAPTER I.Munitions.1. &quot;The scope of Lend-Lease aid agreed to be furnished to the UnitedKingdom for the first 12 months of Stage II is defined in the followingagreements which are set out in the Appendix to Chapter I: &apos;(a) Army Equipment (other than Air): Agreement dated the 20th October,1944.(b) Air (including Fleet Air Arm): Agreement dated the 31st October, 1944;supplemented by a statement of proposed assignments of Aircraft pro-cured by the United States Navy dated the 31st October, 1944; andby a statement making a special provision for possible additional aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm dated the 8th November, 1944.(c) Navy (other than Fleet Air Arm): Agreement dated the 10th November,1944.2.   The estimated dollar value of this aid is as follows : *&apos;$ million. -Army (Ground)        ...      ...      ...      ... 761Air (including Fleet Air Arm)     ...      ...      1,718Navy (other than Fleet Air Arm)...... 358Total    ......... 2,8373.   Three points should be noted in connexion with these figures : (a) The dollar values are the best estimates that can be given at this dateof the cost involved. The agreements have, however, been concludedon the basis of the quantities of the various items included, and theywill not be vitiated by changes in prices.(b) In certain cases where the item is likely to be in very short supply and isof immediate operational importance to the Armed Forces both ofthe United States and the British Empire, it has been agreed that although the necessary finance has been provided no preliminaryallocation of deliveries can be made, since this must depend uponthe decision of the Combined Munitions Assignment Boards at thetime.(c) There are a few cases where requirements have been accepted on a sixmonths&apos; basis.4. For the purpose of this Agreement it has been assumed that the first year of Stage II will be co-terminous with the calendar year of 1945. If inthe event the war with Germany is prolonged well into 1945, some modification in these requirements is probable except as regards those pertaining to the navy and the Fleet Air Arm. If the prolongation is only for a short period, or at avery much reduced degree of intensity, the modification is likely to be negligible.5. In their original submission, the United Kingdom representatives asked that a protocol validity should be given to their accepted requirements. Theylaid stress upon the importance of having as firm as possible a basis on which to plan the utilisation of their resources in the United Kingdom, and to avoid over-insurance during a period when their resources will continue to be strained.The Agencies on the United States side have not felt able to agree to protocolvalidity, and they have stipulated that programmes now accepted shall, as regardsdeliveries, be subject to the established procedure of the Combined MunitionsAssignment Board.6. The Agreements referred to above, however, contain undertakings as tothe acceptances of the specified quantities for production or for delivery fromstocks. The United Kingdom members of the Committee accepted these under-takings as giving the greatest assurance practicable in this regard.7. Mr. Patterson agreed with Sir Robert Sinclair that the fulfilment ofthese accepted requirements, as is the case with their own, shall not be set aside byreason of adherence to reconversion plans made before these Stage II require-ments were made known.
8. The continuance of Reciprocal Aid by the United Kingdom within thelimits prevailing at the time of the defeat of Germany is provided for in theAgreements. While no attempt has been made to particularise the mutual assistance rendered by the Armed Forces of our respective Nations throughout theworld, we have assumed that this will continue to be f reelv given according to theneeds and circumstances of the moment.Note:-The following Payers and Memoranda: relating to the negotiations on munitions are included in the Appendix to Chapter I: *(1) Financial Summary of Munitions Agreements.(2) Ground Army Agreement.(3) Air and Fleet Air Arm Agreement.(4) Supplementary Fleet Air Arm Agreement.(5) Naval Agreement.(6) Letter from Mr. Patterson, United States Under-Secretary of War, toMr. Morgenthau, Secretary of United States Treasury, relating tosupply of tyres and packaging material for military purposes.(7) Letters of Sir Robert Sinclair to General Giles, Chief of Air Staff,United States Army, relating to supply of Bombs, dated the15th November, 1944, and the 18th November, 1944, and Reply ofGeneral Giles, dated the 28th November, 1944.(8) Note on the effects of the Munitions Agreements on the British man-- power position, submitted by Sir Robert Sinclair to Mr. Morgenthau,dated the 17th November, 1944.(9) Extracts from the minutes of the 8th Meeting of the CombinedCommittee on Mutual Lend-Lease Aid, held on the 22nd November,1944.
CHAPTER II.Non-Munitions.1.&quot; The supplies of non-munitions are covered by the letter of the5th December, 1944, from Mr. Leo Crowley, Foreign Economic Administrator,to Mr. H. Morgenthau, Secretary of the Treasury, covering schedules ofagricultural products, raw materials and miscellaneous items, shipping and petroleum, which is printed in the Appendix to Chapter II.2. The total values accepted, subject to certain stated conditions, were asfollows : &apos;$ million.Agricultural Products......    .......      ...      1,022Raw Materials and Miscellaneous Items     ...      ...    .    351Shipping ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ....      ... 852Petroleum ..........      .........        371Total(a)   .............      ...      2,5963. It is specifically stated that the financing of all the above programmes is subject to funds being made available by Congress for expenditure under the Lend-Lease Act. Provision will, in addition, be made for contingencies whenapplication is made for funds.  We see no reason to fear difficulties at that stage.4. Mr. Crowley&apos;s letter makes it clear that &quot; in order to further the most effective prosecution of the war against Japan, it will be necessary to make some provision which will enable the Government of the United Kingdom to providea moderate degree of easement in the standard and conditions of life in the UnitedKingdom in Stage II.&quot;5. In assessing the British food requirements in the first year of Stage IIit has been necessary to make assumptions about the probable stocks at the end of stage I and the possible reduction of stocks during the following year. It hasbeen recognised by the United States authorities and agreed by ourselves that itwill be necessary to review the food requirements in the light of the actual stocks at the close of the German war.6. Generally speaking, these programmes take effect as from the beginningof Stage II. But to facilitate the re-expansion of our export trade, it has beenarranged that the removal of certain raw materials and manufactured goods from Lend-Lease shall take effect from the 1st January, 1945.7. We have made it clear to the United States authorities (see the letter ofMr. Ben Smith to Mr. Crowley of the 5th December, 1944) that the introductionof this programme on the 1st January, 1945, must not prejudice the procurementand supply of items for military end use which have been, or may be, transferred from the Army Supply Programme to F.E.A. responsibility.8. In calculating the provision to be made for our shipping needs, financialcover has been provided for certain coastal vessels which may be operated by theUnited Kingdom and made available to us on Lend-Lease terms, and for certainBaltic coasters and small tankers, of which the supply on Lend-Lease terms isunder consideration.9. The detailed agreement as regards petroleum is included in Mr. Crowley&apos;sletter. It provides, as in the past, for our requirements both from the UnitedStates itself and from United States-owned sources outside the United States tobe provided on Lend-Lease terms. In defined circumstances, we have agreed thatthe United Kingdom shall in Stage II reimburse the United States for certain oilre-exported commercially.10. The F.E.A. has accepted an undertaking on behalf of the UnitedKingdom, to maintain Reciprocal Aid in respect of non-munitions at present provided. The letter from Mr. Ben Smith to Mr. Crowley, dated the25th November, 1944, confirms &quot;that the United Kingdom Government under-takes to continue throughout the first year of Stage II the Supply on reciprocal aid of non-munitions items at present provided under Reciprocal Aid, subjectto the availability of supply and transport and to end use.&quot;(a) In addition there are certain items in these categories included in Chapter III.
The similar assurances given on behalf of Australia, New Zealand and India areexplained in Chapter IV below.Note:-The following Papers and Memoranda relating to the negotiations on Non-Munitions are included in the Appendix to Chapter II: *(1) Extract from minutes of the 8th meeting of the Combined Committeeon Mutual Lend-Lease Aid, held on the 22nd November, 1944.(2) Letter of Mr. L.

CHAPTER III.Additional Items to Safeguard the British Reserve Position.1. The arrangements set out in Chapter II for the supply of non-munitionsitems &quot;provide about $2-6 billion towards United Kingdom dollar outgoingsduring the first year of Stage II estimated at about 13-5 billion. Allowing forthis aid, the best forecasts that can be obtained indicate that during this periodour net gold and dollar earnings from other sources during this period will be insufficient to fill the gap between $3-5 billion and $2-6 billion, so that our gold and dollar reserves are likely to decrease from their peak in August 1944. Thisis mainly the result of reduced receipts from the pay of United States Forcesin the Sterling Area, which are no longer sufficient to cover the adverse balanceof our gold and dollar outgoings on other accounts.2. We accordingly submitted to the American Group full details of theseforecasts and quite frankly stated our need for additional assistance, so as tosafeguard our dollar reserve position, and to enable us to undertake our naturalresponsibilities without excessive financial preoccupations. The United states treasury and the State Department were fully convinced that it was bothdesirable and advisable that, if possible, new and special relief should be givento the extent of $400-$500 million.3. At the request of Mr. Morgenthau we submitted suggestions designedto meet this end. These suggestions took the form of (a) provision of Lend-Leaseterms for a number of items which have recently been treated as ineligible and(b) the revival of certain claims against the United States authorities, claims which for one reason or another had previously been held in suspense.4. In category (a) the major items for which we asked were the reinstate-ment of civilian tobacco ($100 million, including the Dominions) and Caribbeansugar ($71 million), and we also put forward a number of items of less importance.Unfortunately on both the major items there were particular political difficultiesdue to shortage of supplies within the United States which prevented a concessionat the present time. During our discussions, an acute hoarding of &quot;cigarettesarose in the United States, and sugar is, of course, already rationed. It wasuseless to point out that the cigarette shortage was due not to shortage of leafbut to labour and distribution difficulties and that whether on cash or Lend-Leasewe should still receive the same quantity of leaf tobacco from the United States.Nevertheless our proposals for the restoration of civilian tobacco and off-shoresugar to the Lend-Lease list were deferred rather than rejected; and we wereencouraged to hope that these matters could be reconsidered at a later date, ifit should seem essential to provide further relief.*5. In category (b) our major suggestion was that the cost of aircrafttransferred to the United States shortly after Pearl Harbour, for which wehad paid dollars, should be refunded. This suggestion was not turned down, but no present appropriation existed from which payment might be made now. Herealso, therefore, we had to be content with certain minor items.6. In an attempt to recompense us in part for the disappointments wesuffered under the above headings, the American Group did their best to buildup a respectable total from various other sources as listed below. particular attention is called to the provision for emergency housing, which represents a generous stretching of the terms of the Lend-Lease Act in our favour.(i) New Rulings on Lend-Lease Eligibility (definite)  $ million.Oil       ...     &quot;...    . ...      .........&apos; --- 48.

This means a saving of argentine currency equivalent to $17m. but not an increase in our dollars.(c) See Chapter IV, paragraph 4.(d) Of the total provision of $34-5 million, only the estimated &quot; war depletion,&quot; say about$15 million, will actually be recovered from Lend-Lease Funds.7. It seems likely that we can count altogether&apos; on an effective relief offrom $250 million to $300 million from all the above sources.Note..

CHAPTER IY.Australia, New Zealand and India.1. The discussions at Quebec had dealt not only with Lend-Lease andReciprocal Aid between the United States and the United Kingdom, but alsobetween the United States and the rest of the British Empire. Representativesof the Governments of Australia, New Zealand and India took part in thenegotiations with the United States when questions affecting their Governmentsarose.2. Non-Munitions. Discussions about Lend-Lease to the Dominions andIndia were concerned chiefly with the amount of non-munitions that they shouldreceive. The representatives of the three countries mentioned above submitted atthe instance of the United Kingdom Delegation statements of their non-munitions requirements. The following totals were accepted for procurement byF.E.A. in the normal programmed: 13. Details of the items accepted are set forth in schedules appended toletters reproduced in Annex IV.4. The figures given above include provision, to the extent of some$19 million, for certain items previously ineligible for Lend-Lease, which on amore liberal interpretation have now been accepted.5.   In addition, provision was made for : (a) Australia: a Contingency Fund of $10 million for Capital equipment which may later be approved for inclusion by F.E.A.(6) New Zealand : a similar Contingency Fund of $3 million.(c) India : a similar Contingency Fund of $15 million, and also a provisionof $34-5 &quot;million for locomotives, wagons and their components, tocover the maximum obligations of the United States authorities under the special arrangements made for their supply (see Appendix,pp. 62-65).6. Further, the figures given in paragraph 2 exclude the provision madeby the United States Authorities of $5 million in the case of Australia, and$58 million in the case of India, to cover the immediate cost to them of supplyingsilver bullion for coinage, which is to be transferred under special arrangementsfor its return after the close of hostilities.7. The Governments of Australia, New Zealand and India have reason to bewell ^satisfied with the arrangements for the supply to them of non-munitionsduring Stage II, In all three cases F.E.A. have agreed to supply larger quantities than the respective Governments had at first proposed to ask for,mainly because the end of the war in Europe is not likely to permit any significantrelaxation of their war efforts.8. Special arrangements have been agreed with the United states authorities for the supply of locomotives and wagons for India, t This railway material had originally been put forward by the Government of India as amilitary requirement, but was not accepted as such by the United States war department. It was, therefore, re-submitted -as a non-munitions item, and theUnited States authorities agreed to arrangements whereunder payment for thelocomotives would be made on delivery in dollars, which would be set aside by theUnited States Government, and out of which the Government of India would be reimbursed an amount equivalent to the difference between the original cost of the rolling stock and its value to them at the end of the Japanese war. Thus, in effect the Government of India will pay for the post-war value to them of the -rolling-stock, and its war-time use will be brought amder Lend-Lease.9.   Munitions. -As the Australian and New Zealand Armies and Naviesand the Indian Forces are, for the most part, equipped with British-type weapons and equipment, and look to the London Munitions Assignments Board to fulfil* But see also paragraphs 5 and 6 below. t See paragraph. 5 (o) above.N on-Munitions.$ million.australia new ZealandIndia971869
their requirements of United States types, these Governments did riot makeseparate arrangements with the United States Government for the supply to them of such munitions under Lend-Lease in Stage II. Their munitions requirements are, therefore, to this extent included in the programmes for the supply ofmunitions to the United Kingdom.10. There is, however, an exceptiori as regards the requirements ofAustralia and New Zealand for American-type aircraft and air components,which the two Governments procure themselves through the machinery of theWashington Munitions Assignments Board. Partly because the strategic roles in stage II of the R.A.A.F. and the R.N.Z.A.F. have not yet been fully settled,and partly also because the two Dominion Governments were confident that theneeds of their squadrons, which will be operating in the Pacific under UnitedStates strategic command, will when the time comes be fully met by the UnitedStates Government, no agreements comparable to the United Kingdom-UnitedStates agreement as to air items were concluded.11. The attention of the United States Treasury has been drawn to thisomission, in case a special appropriation, which would be of the order of over$260 million, needs to be made to cover these air requirements.12. Oil and Shipping. The requirements of Australia, New Zealand andIndia under Lend-Lease for oil and shipping services are included in therespective United Kingdom programmes.13. Reciprocal Aid. The question of the Reciprocal Aid to be accorded tothe United States by Australia, New Zealand and India was the subject ofconsiderable discussion. At present there are limitations upon this reciprocal aid; the Government of Australia, by agreement with the United States Govern-ment,. confines its aid to the provision of goods and services to United states forces in Australia and its territories; the Government of New Zealand has asimilar limit in theory confining its aid to the South Pacific area-; the Govern-ment of India limits its Reciprocal Aid to the value of the Lend-Lease provided on Indian account.14. The United States War Department attempted to secure the with-drawal of the Australian and New Zealand limitations, and in particular askedAustralia to supply as Reciprocal Aid meat required by the United States forcesin India or China. The War Department also at first made it a condition of theprovision of munitions to the United Kingdom under Lend-Lease that the UnitedKingdom Government should accept responsibility for the provision of reciprocal aid throughout the British Commonwealth. Our delegation, supported by theAustralian representatives, resisted this attempt to persuade the UnitedKingdom to underwrite Dominion Reciprocal Aid, and after much negotiationthe United States War Department were overruled.15. Instead, the Australian, New Zealand and Indian representativescommunicated to the United States -authorities statements (reproduced inthe Appendix to Chapter IV) setting out how far they were prepared to go in thismatter. The Australian Government in their statement affirm their readiness to consider requests for the provision under Reciprocal Aid of goods and services to United States forces outside Australia and its territories and, incases where they do not feel able to accept such requests, undertake to consult with the United States and United Kingdom Governments. The New zealand government in effect withdraw the geographical limitation upon the scope oftheir Reciprocal Aid to the United States forces. The Government of India ineffect maintain their existing limitation, and point out that the extent of theirReciprocal Aid will necessarily be limited by the availability of supplies and the physical possibilities of transport.14. It is understood (see letters exchanged between Lord Keynes&apos; andMr. Acheson see the Appendix to Chapter IV) that in the light of these assurances the United States authorities will agree to withdraw the condition,mentioned above, which they attached to the supply of munitions to the UnitedKingdom.Note .-The following Papers and Memoranda relating to the negotiations on Lend-Lease to Australia, New Zealand and India are included in the Appendix toChapter IV:  .(1) Covering Letters from Mr. Crowley, Foreign Economic Administrator,to Mr. Morgenthau, Secretary of United States Treasury, recom-mending the approval for Lend-Lease of programmes submitted on

CHAPTER Y.Freedom to Export.1. The agreed record of the conversation between the Prime Minister andthe President of the United States at Quebec contained the following passagedealing with United Kingdom exports in Stage II.: &quot; The Prime Minister pointed out that if the United Kingdom wasonce more to pay its way it was essential, that the export trade, which hadshrunk to a very small fraction, should be re-established; naturally no articlesobtained on Lend-Lease or identical thereto would be exported or sold forprofit ;* but it was essential that the United States should not attach anyconditions to supplies delivered to Britain on Lend-Lease which would jeopardise the recovery of her export trade. The President thought thiswould be proper.&quot;2. The proposal which was put to the American members of the CombinedCommittee in British Requirements for Stage II, in Lord Keynes&apos; Note of the25th October, and in discussion, was that from the 1st December, 1944 (lateramended to the 1st January, 1945), the United Kingdom should cease to receiveon Lend-Lease a wide range of raw materials (mainly metals and chemicals)and manufactured goods, to a value of about $40 million. In return the UnitedStates should recognise the United Kingdom&apos;s right to export to all marketsunconditionally. The United Kingdom would be prepared to pay for any suppliesof goods identical t6 those exported from the United Kingdom, but hoped thatthis would not be pressed. In particular, it was suggested that goods suppliedon the munitions programmes should be disregarded for this purpose.S. At the meeting of the Combined Committee held on the 17th November,1944, United States members indicated their acceptance (subject to reference tothe President) of the Statement of Principles printed as Document (iii) of theAppendix to Chapter V. The effect of this agreement would have been to givefreedom to United Kingdom exports from any limitation on Lend-Lease grounds,subject only to the obligation to pay for supplies of goods identical to thoseexported. The United States representatives were unable to agree to disregardin this connection goods supplied on the military programmes, but they did agreeto a satisfactory exemption for components and to a further provision for thewaiving by the United States of the right to call for reimbursement in cases which, while not capable of satisfactory definition in the Statement of Principlesitself, were not such as to make it necessary, from the United States point ofview, to call for reimbursement.4. During the negotiations a number of questions relating to exports were discussed and interpretations of the documents agreed upon. These are summarised in the Note printed as Document (vi) of the Appendix to Chapter V.5. At the final meeting of the Combined Committee on the 22nd November,1944, the United States representatives said that they were unable to agree thatthe Statement of Principles should come into effect before the defeat of Germany.The Statement of Principles accordingly will come into effect after the defeat of Germany, whilst the position between the 1st January and that time is coveredby Mr. Crowley&apos;s undertaking to give the United Kingdom the maximumfreedom practicable by administrative measures under the Export White paper of 1941. Before the conclusion of the negotiations in Washington it was agreedthat as the United Kingdom was not intending to take any iron and steel fromthe United States, either by Lend-Lease or for cash, during 1945, there would beno White Paper limitations on exports of steel or manufactures thereof from the1st January, 1945. Discussions about other materials affected are proceedingthrough normal channels.6. The result of the negotiations on export freedom can be stated brieflyin the following terms : (a) Between the 1st January, 1945, and the defeat of Germany the provisionsof the White Paper of 1941 continue in effect, subject to the easementsarising from &apos; the change in raw material and non-munitionsprogrammes which go into effect on that date, and from Mr. Crowley&apos;undertaking referred to above. It is not likely that any practicableexports in this period will be impeded by Lend-Lease considerations.* See full text and footnote to the Agreed Record of Conversation between the Prime Ministerand President at Quebec Appendices, p. 4. - -
(6) After the defeat of Germany the United Kingdom has complete freedom to export (subject always to the needs of the war against Japan), butthere is a liability to reimburse the United States for any goods&quot; received on Lend-Lease which are identical to goods exported fromthe United Kingdom. The extent of the liability will be determinedfrom time to time by discussion with representatives of the ForeignEconomic Administration.Note:- -The foilotuing Papers and Memoranda relating to Freedom to Export areincluded in the A appendix to Chapter V: (1) Note on the Reasons for fixing the 1st December as the Date for theAbolition of White Paper Restrictions on British Exports and suggestions for dealing with the problem of Stocks, sent byLord Kevnes to the United States Representatives on the25th October, 1944. -(2) Extract from Minutes of 7th Meeting of the Combined Committeeon Mutual Lend-Lease Aid, held on the 17th November, 1944.(3) Statement of Principles to govern the Use of Lend-Lease Articles.(4) Letter from Lord Keyries to Mr. Morgenthau, Secretary of United states treasury, enclosing a Statement relating to the Working of the^  Sterling Area Dollar Pool, dated the 20th November, 1944.(5) Extract from Minutes of the 8th Meeting of the Combined Committee,held on the 22ncl November, 1944.(.6) Note by Mr. J.
