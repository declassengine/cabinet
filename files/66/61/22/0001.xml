DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).SECRET / lW.P. (k5)  67 - f COPY NO.. 27th JANUARY.  1 9h5WAR CABINETNEGOTIATIONS WITH SWEDENMemorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of Economic Warfare &quot; -We are endeavouring to reach.agreement with Sweden on anumber of outstanding commercial and economic warfare questions.Negotiations began last month, but were temporarily suspended overChristmas.    It will be difficult, if not impossible, to bring themto a satisfactory conclusion and to obtain our own urgent requirementsunless we are able to give the Swedes certain assurances regarding their supplies - especially of coal, - during the first twelve monthsafter the end of the war in Europe.2.       Our main requirements from Sweden are as follows:-(a) The conclusion of a new Anglo-American-Swedish War trade agreement by which the Swedes, in return for certainCombined Boards allocations, will undertake tocontinue their present embargo on all exports to Axiscountries, to take their full share in reconstruction in Europe, and to implement the Bretton Woods resolutionregarding Axis loot.(b) An undertaking by the Swedes to place their wholemercantile marine at the disposal of U.M.A. /   ,(c) Signature of the draft Payments Agreement between theBank.of England and the Riksbank. by which the Swedes.Will make krbnor available to us in return forsterling up to  50,000,000, thus relieving us of thenecessity to pay gold.(d) Various departments are anxious, to make purchases in sweden for delivery as soon as the Baltic is free.    Inparticular, the Ministry of Supply attach greatimportance to obtaining as soon as possible Swedishtimber, steel and iron ore.    The- Cabinet has recentlyagreed to the purchase of Swedish prefabricated timberhouses, and the Minister of Works has already been authorised to place a small order, with a view tolarger orders later on.v&quot;rnf?rd-ep 1:0 avoid confusion, negotiations covering all the^e various matters have been handled by the Ministry of Economic Warfare.3*       The Swedes are holding up the signature of the payments agreement and- the further negotiations on timber contracts until theycan see the extent to which their exports to this country and the

4 flO ftcredits required to cover them will he balanced by their importsfrom the sterling area.    They quite realise that for at leasttwelve months after the war they.will need to export to us and other.European countries considerably more t-han they can hope to import.They claim that, they must,&apos; however, place some limit on thismargin&apos;in order to avoid inflation.    They were prepared to grant theUnited Kingdom&apos;a credit of 500,000,000 kronor in the first year(about  30,000,000)  which would cover our more urgent requirements,if we would give them an assurance that British exports to Swedenduring the same period would amount to three-fifths of this sum.Such an assurance the Board of Trade and the Department of overseasTrade are unable to give.h.       Our negotiations have thus reached a deadlock,   unless wecan reassure the Swedes regarding their own supplies we shall almost-certainly fail to secure the payments Agreement and the timber andother commodities mentioned above.    Moreover, until the Swedes meet us on these points we are forced to hold up our signature to thenew War Trade Agreement.    Both the Americans and the Swedes.would have&quot;been prepared to sign this agreement in December and are probablywilling to do so now.    But the assurances which it containsregarding Combined Boards allocations represented, and stillrepresnt, almost our only bargaining counter.    We are thereforereluctant to join in such assurances until we are reasonablycertain- that our own requirements will be met.    This, however, isan embarrassing situation, and may?before long lead the americans to believe that we are jeopardising Allied economic warfareobjectives in order to promote our own supply and financial interests.5.    &apos; -While it appears impossible at this stage to give the Swedksdefinite assurances as to their future sterling imports it is likely that, in view-of the outstanding importance of coal to the mainten-ance of Swedish economy, the Swedes might be persuaded to acceptgeneral assurances on other commodities, provided we could offerthem something more definite as regards coal,    Now that all Swedishtrade with Germany is at an end they are not getting any coal.Their present stocks will last, with rigid economy, until the endof this year.    But thereafter Swedish economy would collapse if coalwere not obtained from somewhere.    Their minimum annual requirements are about three and a half to four million tons, which compares with: a normal importation of seven million tons before the war.While the difficulties of making definite commitments on coal are fully recognised, I submit that the advantages to be gained would&quot;justify special measures.    I. therefore ask for authority to pursueone of the following alternatives(a) We should include in the War Trade Agreement- an undertaking that we and the Americans will make available to Sweden three and a half million tonsof coal during the first twelve months after theend of hostilities in Europe, subject to unforeseensupply considerations.    This is a formula whichhas been employed in previous War Trade agreements with Sweden and one which they would probably accept,(b) We should include in the War Trade Agreementan undertaking that we and the Americans will &quot;use our best endeavoursnup to the limits imposed by thesupply position, to see that goods are madeavailable to Sweden in quantities sufficient tomaintain her economy on a reasonable basis&quot;.    This\ would constitute a general assurance regardingcoal supplies.    At the same time we ourselves should give the Swedes informally a more -definite commitment^that we would see to it that tbtey obtained from some-source a minimum of one million tons of coal duringthe first twelve months after the end of Europeanhostilities. ^

(I should prefer the second alternative since it may bedifficult to obtain American agreement to the first, and inm case they would take some time to arrive at a decision     I,/ould, however, point out that whatever happens after the. war the swedes will have to be supplied with a small ration of coal fromsomewhere.    By .re c ognialng  this now we can probably obtain burown urgent requirements on extremely advantageous terms.(Intld)    D.M.F.ijinistry of Economic Yirarfare, W. 1 .27tii JANUARY,  1 9kh* .
