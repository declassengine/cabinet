NAVAL SITUATION.General Review. .1.   Damage has been inflicted on enemy shipping off the Norwegian coast.Naval aircraft have seriously damaged enemy oil refineries in Sumatra.Norwegian Waters.2. On the night of the 27th/28th H.M. cruisers Diadem and Mauritius,N.W. of Bergen, intercepted and damaged three enemy destroyers which retiredunder cover of shore batteries.- Our force sustained slight damage and there werefour casualties.On the following night aircraft from H.M. ships Nairana and Campania(escort carriers) attacked enemy shipping N. of Bergen and seriously damagedthree ships. Ships of the Home Fleet, including H.M.C. destroyers Algonquinand Sioux and the Norwegian destroyer Stord, covered this operation.On the 22nd H.M. S/M Venturer probably torpedoed a 5,000-ton ship and anescorting trawler off Stavanger.Coastal Command aircraft have also successfully attacked shipping off theNorwegian coast (see &quot; Air Situation &quot;). .Home Waters.3. On the 26th H.M.S. Manners (frigate) was torpedoed W. of Anglesey andwas towed into port. She had six fatal,casualties, 17 wounded and 30 missing.The U-boat was later sunk by an escort group of frigates, one of which,H.M.S. Aylmer, was damaged by ramming the U-boat.On the night of the 29th/30th, two groups of E-boats operating off the humber were driven off by our patrols.On the 30th a motor minesweeper was mined and sunk off Flushing, and next day H.M.S. Frolic (minesweeper) was damaged by a mine in the Thames estuary.4. During the week ending the 28th the combined British and U.S.discharges through the liberated ports were approximately 102,000 men, 10,250vehicles, 405,000 tons of stores, 42,600 tons of petrol and 43,000 tons ofammunition.Mediterranean.5. Bombardments by Allied warships have, continued near the French-Italian frontier.On the 30th the salvage vessel King Salvor was damaged by a mine offMarseilles.In the Adriatic H.M.S. Antares (minesweeper) and the A/S trawler Pollockwere damaged by mines off Ancona and Zara respectively; both ships reachedport.East Indies.6. On the 24th over 100 aircraft from H.M. ships Indomitable, Illustrious,Indefatigable and Victorious attacked oil refineries at Palembang in centralSumatra while fighters attacked airfields. Damage was done to a power house,three, crude oil distilleries, two distillation plants and many other buildings atPladjoe. The striking force was intercepted by enemy fighters, 13 of which were shot down and six probably destroyed; 34 aircraft were destroyed and 25 others damaged on the ground. Nine of our aircraft were lost. Aircraft from thesecarriers made a further attack on Palembang on the 29th and a preliminary reportindicates that good results were achieved. Fifteen of our aircraft are missing buteight of the crews were saved. Eight enemy fighters were shot down and fourwere destroyed on the ground. During an air attack on Illustrious one officer and11 ratings were killed and seven ratings were wounded. The attack was carriedout by seven enemy aircraft, six of which were shot down.The Pladjoe refinery is the largest and most important refinery in the far east. The oilfields in Sumatra, particularly Pangkalan Brandan in the northwhich was attacked on the 4th, and Palembang in the south, produce about three-quarters of the total aviation spirit required by Japan.7. During a recent patrol in the Strait of Malacca H.M. S/M Strongbowsank a junk and damaged a large tug. She sustained considerable damage froma number of counter-attacks.
Pacific.8. US. carrier forces have carried out attacks on Indo-China5 the RyukuIslands and the Bonin Islands. Bombardments by cruisers and destroyers were also carried out in the Bonins.In &quot;the Philippines amphibious landings by U.S. forces have been carriedout on Santiago Island (Lingayen Gulf), on the N.E. coast of Mindoro, on GrandeIsland at the entrance to Subic Bay, and on the Zambales coast of western Luzon.During the week a large amount of enemy shipping was sighted in theFormosa area; off the French Indo-China coast less shipping than usual has been sighted.9. The Dutch S/M O. 19 on patrol in the Java Sea torpedoed and probably sank a 3,000-ton escorted ship. Counter-attacks considerably damaged thesubmarine.Anti-Submarine Operations.10.   Six attacks, all by surface craft, were reported during the week.On the 26th H.M. frigates Aylmer and Colder sank a U-boat in the IrishSea, and on the following day H.M. frigate Keats possibly sank another in the st. George&apos;s Channel.Enemy Intelligence.11. Germany has now seven Ma&apos;as type destroyers, ten of * the Narvik typeand eight Elbings. There are four Elbings now fitting out and four morebuilding.Since the middle of 1944 E-boat production has steadily increased and it isnow estimated that about 15 E-boats are being built monthly.U-boats.12.   There is no appreciable change in the U-boat dispositions.It is estimated that 70 of the new type 1,600-ton U-boats are complete.   Therate of completion is about 16 per month.Enemy Attack on Shipping.13. During the week a Norwegian tanker and a U.S. ship in a homewardbound convoy were torpedoed by a U-boat in the St. George&apos;s Channel but reachedport.Provisional shipping losses by enemy action during January were 14 ships of67,181 tons.Allied Minelaying.14. Surface craft have laid a large number of mines in Home Waters, and aircraft laid mines in the Kattegat.An Allied submarine laid mines in the approaches to Batavia.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.15. On two nights of the week E-boats probably laid mines off Harwichand the Humber; and in the Scheldt approaches where 31 acoustic and five moored mines have been destroyed. Eleven mines have been destroyed off Havre and fouroff Boulogne.Several dangerous areas have been recently declared between Split and Fiume.The mine totals are 6,323 ground and 8,578 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.16. A 9,000-ton ship was sunk by sabotage on the 16th and the next day asmall laden ship was damaged by an explosion in Oslofiord.It is estimated that since the 11th of January at least 100,000 tons of transports have arrived in Denmark from ports in southern Norway.[29136] B
MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General..17. In three out of the four main sectors on the Western Front the Allieshave regained the initiative. The Ardennes bulge has been eliminated,, valuablegains of ground have been made by the Second British Army west of the Roer,and in the Vosges steady if slow progress has been made. In the fourth sector,Alsace, the situation, potentially dangerous early in-the week, now appears tobe under control, and the probability is that the Germans are going over to the defensive there as well.Southern Sector.18. In the Vosges, the First French Army&apos;s attack N.W. of Mulhouse hasmade slow progress in heavy fighting. North of Colmar U.S. troops under french command have had more success, pushing back the enemy to the canal 2 miles .E. of the city.&apos;On the 25th the situation east and west of Hagenau appeared increasinglydangerous. The enemy, having concentrated five of his best divisions in this area (including three Panzer divisions), attacked to the north and east of thetown and achieved some penetrations; U.S. formations, however, counter-attackedswiftly and restored the situation.   There have been no further enemy attacks.Central Sector.19. The Third and First U.S. Armies have made steady if unspectacularprogress on a wide front in the Ardennes, pursuing an enemy now clearly resignedto complete withdrawal to the Siegfried defences but continuing to show fight.The possibility that he might made a stand on the R. Clerf (5 miles west of the siegfried Line) was disposed of on the 25th when a bridgehead was gained north of Clervaux, quickly to be followed by others south of the town. Since the 28thmore progress has been made north and south of St. Vith in the general directionof Prum. In conditions of deep snow and in the face of stubborn resistance, theR. Our was reached and a bridgehead secured on the 30th by the same U.S.division which had previously forced the Moselle and later the Saar.Northern Sector.20. The British Second Army in the area of Roermond has now pushedthe mainT)ody of enemy forces across the R. Roer. The Germans still hold a fewvillages and strong points west of the river, but these are now being systematicallymopped up.On the 26th a small force of Canadians attacked enemy troops holding asmall island in the Maas due north of Tilburg. The Germans immediatelycounter-attacked and localised fighting took place but the island was cleared by-the 31st.An attack by one division on the right of the Ninth U.S. Army,which was launched on the 30th in conjunction with a division on the left ofthe First U.S. Army, has made promising headway in the Monchau area,and has cleared several villages.Eastern Europe.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.:21. The overall picture on the Eastern Front during the past week sincethe 24th has been one of steady Russian progress on the flanks in East Prussiaand Silesia, with the main attack towards Berlin being developed with very littleslackening in speed.Latvia.22. A Russian attack began on the . 24th against the German forces,estimated at about 30 divisions, isolated in Latvia. The Russians have notclaimed any progress in this area, but some action on their part would seem likely to try to interfere with any German programme of evacuation.Memel was taken by the Russians on the 28th.
East Prussia.23. The German escape corridor out of East Prussia, which on the 23rdhad been narrowed to 20 miles, was ultimately closed on the 26th by russian forces which reached the Baltic N.E. of Elbing. Since that date the Germanpocket in East Prussia has been squeezed tighter by Russian progress from theeast and south, and by the 29th Russian troops had reached the outskirts ofKbnigsberg.An attempt on the 29th and the 30th by German forces to break out towardsthe west made some progress.It is too early to make any reliable&apos;estimate of the number of german divisions cut off out of the original garrison of more than 20 divisions..Central Sector.24. In the Polish Corridor and in Central Poland considerable progress has been made by two main thrusts aimed apparently at Stettin and Berlin.By-passing and encircling the fortresses of Thorn and Posen, where fighting isstill in progress, Russian forces have pushed on west and N.W. and have entered the German provinces of Pomerania and Brandenburg. They have now taken a 50-mile stretch of the main Berlin-Danzig railway N.E. of Landsbergand are within 6 miles of this latter town.The Germans are believed to have a defence line running south from thearea of Landsberg to the R. Oder based on a system of concrete defences con-structed in the late 1930&apos;s. The depth of the defences is thought to be 2-3 miles in this sector.In Southern Poland no spectacular advances have been made, but the gainsare of considerable importance. Along the R. Oder, which the Russians reached on the 23rd, they now have several bridgeheads above and below Breslau. It isquestionable whether the R. Oder, although not completely frozen over, is at this time of year a very serious barrier to the Russians.The advance into Upper Silesia-has deprived the Germans of a substantial part of this important industrial area. The loss of Katowice and the Dabrowacoal&apos;area to the north of the town will undoubtedly have a considerable effect on german production.In the extreme south of Poland and in Czechoslovakia the Russians continueto advance in very difficult country.Up to the present three German infantry divisions from the west have been identified in the central sector of the Eastern Front. Reports indicate that further divisions may be on their way, including the armoured divisions of six Panzer Army.Southern Sector.25. The German attack towards Budapest from the S.W. has apparently been halted, and it appears that the Russians have once more gone over to the offensive in this area.The enemy at present has an abnormal concentration of armour in Hungary,and it may well be necessary for him to withdraw some of his forces from this area for the defence of Germany.Italy.26.   Nothing to report.Greece.27. Allied troops have carried out routine patrols of the area under their control without any incidents.Burma.28. On the 26th a force of Royal Marines made a successful landing onCheduba Island, off the Arakan coast. No opposition has yet been encounteredand the enemy are reported to be withdrawing south. About one-third ofRamree Island is now in our hands. Stiff opposition is being encountered southof Yanbauk Chaung.Myohaung was occupied by our troops on the 25th. Their leading elementsare 7 miles east of Minbya.
Our troops in the Kangaw area, who have been reinforced, have extendedtheir perimeter in spite of heavy counter-attacks supported by artillery.Progress has been maintained in Central Burma. Troops from the Tilinarea have reached Pauk and Thamadaw without encountering opposition. Othercolumns clearing the area west of the Chindwin have reached a point 25 miles.W. of Monywa, also out of contact. Further east, our troops have cleared the road Monywa-Myinmu and are in contact with the enemy 15 miles S.W. ofMyinmu.In the bend of the Irrawaddy our forward troops are in contact 5 miles .W. of Sagaing. &apos;Further bombing and counter-attacks have been launched against our bridge-head east of the Irrawaddy at Kyaukmyaung and Thabeikkyin.In Northern Burma British troops have advanced a further 10 miles to thesouth and are now only 17 miles from Mong Mit. A U.S,; brigade (MarsTask Force) is operating in the area 30 miles N.W. of Hsenwi.Philippines.Luzon. &apos;29. After heavy fighting U.S. troops have captured Rosario, which lies in the mountainous country N.E. of San Fabian. In the San Manuel area,S.E. of San Fabian, savage counter-attacks by Japanese armoured units have been successfully repulsed.   In this area the enemy has lost approximately 58 tanks.In the Southern sector, U.S. troops have continued their advance towards Manila, meeting little serious opposition. Clark Field, which includessome 13 airstrips, was captured on the 25th, and San Fernando, a key rail and road centre less than 40 miles from Manila, on the 29th. Press reports state thatthey are now only 25 miles north of Manila.On the 29th U.S. forces carried out an unopposed landing on the west coast of Luzon,-in the area of San Narciso. These operations, which aim at cutting off the Bataan Peninsula, are proceeding very satisfactorily. They have captured San Marcelino with its airfield, and press communiques state that thenaval base of Olongapo in Subic Bay is already in U.S. hands.Casualties reported up to the 27th &quot;amount to 8,637 Japanese killed, and120 Japanese and 433 Koreans and Formosans captured.China. . .. 30. Japanese forces advancing north from the Canton area reached Kukongon the 29th, Chenhsien and Pinkshek having previously been reached by otherJapanese columns from the north and west. The entire Hengyang-Cantonrailway must now therefore be considered in Japanese hands.The US. airfield at Suichuan was destroyed by the U.S. troops on the 25thas Japanese forces driving S.E. were reported within 18 miles of it on the 27th.In the south coastal region the Japanese continued, their advance east, andby the 26th were approximately half way between Waichow, and Swatow.AIR SITUATION.Europe.United Kingdom.31. Fighter Command flew 27 defensive sorties. Details of enemy activityagainst this country are reported under &quot; Enemy Activity and Home Security.&quot;Home Waters.32. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 495 sorties; two aircraft are missing.Mosquitoes and Halifaxes attacked shipping off the Norwegian coast; two5,000-ton ships, a 2,500-ton ship and a coaster were set on fire and a large ship and a destroyer were damaged.Bomber Command aircraft laid 30 sea-mines.Western Europe.33. In the week ended dawn on the 31st, aircraft of S.H.A.E.F. (Air) flew6,937 sorties and dropped 2,827 tons of bombs.   In the week ended dawn on
the 1st, Bomber Command and the U.S. VIII Bomber Command flew 3,687sorties and dropped 8,416 tons while Fighter Command and the U.S. VIIIFighter Command flew 1,532 sorties. Eleven enemy aircraft were destroyed;80 Allied aircraft are missing but some of these may have landed safely on theContinent.Operations were again severely restricted by adverse weather conditions.In the battle area, bombers of S.H.A.E.F. (Air) attacked communications,supply centres and other objectives, with good results. The main effort was madeon the 29th, when better weather prevailed; 651 tons of bombs were dropped on railways, roads, dumps and defended villages in the central sector. Fighter-bombers and fighters provided close support for Allied troops, attackedcommunications and other targets, and flew offensive sweeps; about 2,500 road and rail vehicles, 50 locomotives, many A.F.V.s and several tanks were destroyed.Heavy attacks were made on industrial and railway centres in Germany, theprincipal targets being Stuttgart (1,877 tons), Cologne (1,480 tons), Crefeld(648 tons), Cassel (627 tons), Munster (507 tons), Hohenbudberg (near Duisburg-427 tons), Dortmund (two benzol plants 406 tons), Siegen (375 tons), Coblenz(362 tons), Duisburg, 320 tons), Hamm (294 tons), Niederlahnstein (nearCoblenz-291 tons) and Bielefeld (284 tons).Most of these attacks were made through cloud, but it is believed that in themain good concentrations of bombing were achieved. Some attacks, including those on Cologne, Hohenbudberg and Dortmund, were carried out in betterweather, which enabled crews to bomb visually with good results. photographs taken soon after the attack on Cologne show that the entire length of theRodenkirchen autobahn bridge had collapsed into the Rhine and that all rivertraffic had been completely blocked.Small-scale attacks were made on other targets, including Berlin, which was bombed on three nights by a total of 121 Mosquitoes.GAP. fighters offered only negligible opposition to Allied air attacks and provided only slight assistance to their troops in close support operations.(Note. Appendix VII gives Raid Assessment Reports.)Southern Europe.34. In the week ended dawn on the 30th, aircraft of the M.A.A.F. flew4,024 sorties and dropped 1,387 tons of bombs. Four enemy aircraft were destroyed and 33 Allied aircraft are missing.Unfavourable weather again restricted flying. No operations were under-taken by bombers of the Strategic Air Force.Italy.35. The main efforts of the Tactical Air Force were directed againstcommunications and supply centres in Northern Italy and close support targets in the battle area. Railways were cut in a large number of places, especially onthe Brenner route, and 650 road and rail vehicles, 40 locomotives and severalbridges were destroyed. In addition, hits were made on a medium-sized tankerat Savona, on docks,at Genoa and Spezia and on factories near Spezia and atFerrara.Fighters of the Balkan and Coastal Air Forces successfully attackedexplosive motor-boats and guns in the Lussinpiccolo area (40 miles S.E. of Pola)and a cellulose factory in N.E. Italy.Yugoslavia.36. A total of 46 Mustangs made three daylight attacks on railway targets in the Brod/Doboj/Zagreb areas, destroying a bridge, 5 locomotives and severalvehicles.JE gean.37. Twelve Baltimores attacked gun positions, an ammunition dump and aheadquarters on Milo, and 32 others attacked enemy troops on Piscopi.Russia.38. In spite of unfavourable weather, the Russian Air Force was very active,especially in the central sector. The G.A.F. scale of effort showed a considerable increase during the past week, and it is clear that Considerable reinforcements of single-engined fighters and ground attack aircraft have been brought up.
Far Bast.Burma and French Indo-China.39. During the week ended dusk on the 29th, Allied aircraft flew 5,044sorties, including 3,368 by bombers and fighter-bombers. In addition, Dakotatransport aircraft flew 5,965 sorties carrying 9,905 tons, and light transport aircraft flew 3,006 sorties, carrying 857 men and evacuating 597 casualties. FiveAllied aircraft are missing.In the Arakan, full support for Allied troops was provided throughout theweek particularly in the Myebon district, up to 280 sorties being flown on one day on such missions. - A force of 47 Liberators also obtained good results when214 tons were dropped on enemy positions near Myebon.In the Northern Shan States, attacks were made on enemy troop concentra-tions near Lashio, and storage areas near Hsenwi, whilst close support wasafforded in the neighbourhood of Twinnge and of Manhkam. Mitchellsdestroyed two bridges on the Hsipaw/Laihka road.Numerous sorties were also flown by fighter aircraft in close support oftroops in the Monywa/Myinmu/Singu areas of Central Burma, whilst Mitchellsin strengths of 35-48 successfully attacked enemy positions at Kabwet (twice)and headquarters at Sagaing. Enemy communications also received attention,a number of rivercraft being destroyed or damaged. The airfields at Meiktila,Thedaw, Heho and Hsumhsai were attacked on several occasions. ^ Large fires were raised at the enemy&apos;s forward base at Amarapura (10 miles S.W. of Mandalay) when 181, tons were dropped by Liberators.In Lower Burma, Liberators destroyed 8 bridges on the Burma-Siamrailway, whilst Beaufighters in attacks on shipping in theTrrawaddy River andthe Gulf of Martaban set 7 small vessels on fire and sank or damaged over 100rivercraft.In French Indo-China, 22 Super-Fortresses bombed the naval yards andarsenal a.t* Saigon through cloud, whilst aircraft operating from China attackedrailway targets at Phu Lang Thuong and Nam Tinh and destroyed the centrespan of the bridge at Thanh how.Sixty-five Super-Fortresses were despatched to lay sea mines off Saigon,in Cam Ranh Bay and in Singapore harbour. Liberators carried out similarmissions off Penang and Pangakalan Sosoe (Sumatra)&apos;.China Zone.40. Mustangs made successful sorties against airfields near Shanghai andPeiping, destroying 67 and damaging over 70 enemy aircraft, while a further 14were destroyed on the ground in the neighbourhood of Suchow. Mustangs alsooperated successfully against rail targets and destroyed over 30 locomotives atSinsiang and 20 at Kaifeng, in addition to a considerable amount of rolling-stock.In Formosa, Liberators operated in small numbers by night against targets in Takao, 13 large fires being started during the course of one of the attacks.Liberators laid sea mines in the harbour of Hong Kong. Shipping in thesewaters was attacked throughout the week, 4 vessels being sunk in the FormosaStraits, and Catalinas scoring hits on one destroyer (at anchor off Amoy) andon 3 sea-trucks and 7 luggers, while a large freighter was set on fire at Keelung.Japan.41. Tokyo was bombed in 4/10ths to 8/10ths cloud by 59 Super-Fortresses.Fighter opposition was encountered, some 150/200 enemy aircraft makingattacks; 57 were destroyed, 21 probably destroyed and 41 damaged, whilst5 Super-Fortresses were shot down over the target and two crashed in the sea.On each night of the week an average of 3 Super-Fortresses operated against targets on Honshu, including the gas works at Osaka and oil installations in tokyo. -Pacific.42. In the Philippines, activity was maintained at a high level on Luzon,and a wide diversity of targets was attacked. Over 170 sorties were flown by liberators against Corregidor Island and the base at Cavite, and results are reported to have been excellent. Two squadrons of Mitchells attacked installa-tions at Cabcaben (Bataan peninsula) and one squadron enemy positions on
Israbao Island (entrance to Manila harbour), while in the same vicinity Bostonsand Liberators attacked the gun positions on Carabao Island and at.Fort Drum.The coastal defences on Ferande Island in Subic Bay were heavily attacked on three occasions.Considerable damage was inflicted on the airfield at Tuguegarao, whilstthose at Aparri and Laoag also received attention.Tactical aircraft furnished close support throughout the week to the groundtroops, particularly in the Rosario area, where in the course of one sweep alone22 bridges were demolished.On Negros, Liberators bombed the airfields of Silay and Binalbagan.No reports have been received of any enemy offensive or defensive activity in force.Elsewhere in the Pacific the main feature of the week has been the repeatedattacks both by day and by night on Iwo Jima (Kazans) ; over 270 tons of bombs were dropped by Super-Fortresses and Liberators in attacks on the 23rd and 24thin addition to which over 130 sorties were flown by Liberators against this targetduring the period. Other small islands attacked included Babelthuap (Palau)and Yap (Carolines), both on three occasions.Over 100 sorties were flown against targets in North Halmahera. In new guinea, villages and supply lines in the Wewak area were attacked daily, whilstsome 170 sorties were flown against objectives in the Rabaul area (New Britain) .ENEMY ACTIVITY AND HOME SECURITY.General.43. A total of 51 incidents from long-range rockets have been reported during the week. In the early part a large proportion fell in London, but towardsthe end of the week the incidence was more scattered. Over the period 28 fellin London, 16 in Essex, 3 each in Kent and Hertfordshire, and 1 in Sussex.On five occasions casualties amounted to between 15 and 30 killed and up to 30 seriously injured. One important aircraft-component factory suffered damage likely to curtail production by 50 per cent, for a week, otherwise therewas no instance of outstanding damage beyond that typical in built-up areas;in more that half the incidents damage and casualties were slight.Casualties.44. The estimated civilian casualties for the week ended 0600 on the31st January were : 88 killed.      284 serious.

APPENDIX VII.Air Attacks on Germany.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Bru-w. Photographs taken on 20th January after the attack by aircraft of bomber Command on 16th/ 17th January &quot;show that very severe fresh damage has been caused in all parts of the synthetic oil plant, which as a result has nowbeen rendered inactive.Cologne. Photographs taken on 28th January show that as a result of theU.S.A.A.F. attack earlier in the day the entire length of the Rodenkirchen auto-bahn bridge has collapsed into the Rhine. Ice is seen to be piling up against thewreckage and all river traffic appears to have been completely blocked.GelsenkirchenjBuer. Photographs taken on 22nd January show that as aresult of the Bomber Command attack on 29th / 30th December severe damage was caused in the main tank storage area of the Scholven synthetic oil plant, in thecoal preparation area, the distillation area and the workshop area. Buildingsaffected include the paste preparation and injector house, the gas purificationplant, and three gas holders. Four medium-sized tanks have been destroyed and four damaged.It is estimated that production will be stopped for about a month.Mannheim. *Taken on 29th January photographs show that the U.S.A.A.F.attack on 21st January caused severe fresh damage to the Heinrich Lanz A.F.V.factory in the Lindenhof district. A lathe shop, two Workshops and a very largebuilding containing several assembly lines have all suffered heavy damage.Neuss Marshalling Yard. Interpretation of photographs taken 8n23rd January about one hour after the U.S.A.A.F. attack, is hampered by snowwhich precludes a detailed statement on damage. Many hits, however, can beseen in the sorting sidings and near the northern fly-overs, while other hits are seen in the rail junction south of Neuss and near the passenger station; in this area some railway trucks were still on fire. Immediately west of the main stationthe bolt and nut factory of Bauer and Schaurte has been affected, and industrialdamage has also been caused at the southern end of the dock area. Several fires were still burning in the closely built-up area in the north-west of Neuss.SterkradeI Holten. Photographs taken on 28th January show that theU.S.A.A.F. attack on 22nd January has caused considerable fresh damage to the synthetic oil plant. Most important damage is to the contact oven house and asa result of this attack no synthetic oil production is likely for at least three to four weeks and it will probably be restricted to 25 per cent, of normal for some weeks after that.
