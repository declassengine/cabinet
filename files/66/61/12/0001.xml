Prime Minister, I circulate herewitha copy of a Minute addressed to him by the Minister of war transport.. .(Signed)    E. E.  BRIDGESOffices  of the War Cabinet,S.W.1.-    24th JANUARY 1945.PRIME MINISTERFleet Train requirements in April 1944, 23 new ships under construction of a totaldeadweight of 230,000 tons were allocated, to the Fleet -training accordance with your directive.At that time the Fleet Train had already absorbed 63 ships of 452,038 tons deadweight.Since April 1944 I have been able to make further allo-cations consisting of 10 large ocean ships and 16 smallerships with a total deadweight of 149,875 tons.Having regard to the time required in converting existingships or completing new ones under construction, the additional demand now presented would mean the - allocation of 26 ships of169,000 tons deadweight in the first quarter of 1945.    Ofthese, 13 ships of about 130,000 tons deadweight would-beocean carriers.Three more ocean carriers of about 30,000 tons deadweightwould need to-be provided in the middle of 1945.

Quite recently, the Admiralty have also asked for 2 oceancarriers of 10,150 tons deadweight, and &quot;3 medium/sized ships of 1+,1+iO tons deadweight now under construction to be completed and allocated as Landing Craft Carriers for the Par-East.&quot;This requirement (33,500 tons) is in addition to those coveredby the First Lord&apos;s paper.&quot;The First Lord explains why he has not been oble to implement your directive to the effect that 230,000 tons ofocean going shipping rshbuld be released by the Admiraltysimultaneously with the completion of the 23 Repair ShipssTo date the Admiralty have released, or are proposing to release, the following ocean going ships:Released and operating -1 ship ........ 8,960 deadweight tonsReleased and being reconditioned - i   ,1 ship ..  ..  ..  .. 8,625         &quot;             &quot;Released but laid up because ofthe shortage of shipyard faci-facilities for reconditioning -.2 ships......  ..    2h,000 &quot; &quot;Promised by the end of the iWar with Germany but requiring- heavy reconversion -2 ships..   ......    20,h00Total - 6 ships........    61,985The total of 57,000 tons quoted by the First &quot;Lord asreleased is made up of the first four of the ships just mentioned together with one passenger ship of 9,50.0 tons&apos; dead-weight, which requires over 12 months reconditioning and isawaiting shipyard facilities, and one ship of 6,330 tons dead-weight which W&amp;s a temporary allocation to the Navy and alreadyknown to be due for release before your directive was given.All requirements are net and understood to make no.allowance for losses-;In addition, the shipment of Admiralty stores and coal to overseas bases is equivalent to the permanent employmentof some 220,000 tons deadweight of ocean going shipping.The recent combined survey of shipping resources hasrevealed serious deficiencies in coming months, even apartfrom the possibility of increased losses.W.P.

In those circumstances, while I do not wish to delay orprejudice approved operations, I am hound to submit that thepossibility of reducing the sea-borne support required by theFleet in the India Ocean and Pacific Ocean should be examined with a view to limiting requirements at least to the ships which are already allocated,, :&quot;L.20th January, 1945Minister of War Transport- Summary of Fleet Train RequirementsShips   deadweight tonnageAllocated prior to April, 19446314-52,038Under directive of April, 194423230,000Allocated since April    194426149,875Present additional demand *tor 19451st quarter 2nd quarter263169,0003^,000Additional L.G.  carriers33,500I,tt64,4l3
