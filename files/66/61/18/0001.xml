(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)i i  SECRET \j .W.P.(45) 63 .       / COPY NO.    ,S   ^S5TH JANUARY.  1945WAR CABINETMESSAGE CIRCULATED TO THE TROOPS IN GREECEReport by the Minister of Labour. and National ServicetTHE COMMITTEE&quot;1&quot;were instructed &quot;by the War Cabinet at their meeting on 2nd January 1945 (W.M.(45) 1st Conclusions, Item 8)to establish the facts about the source of a Reuter messagedated 13th December 1944 containing an article about Greeceby Mr. A,J. Cummings, political correspondent of the NewsChronicle.      The Committee were also asked to enquire as tothe circumstances in which, and the approval subject to which,the message was transmitted to Athens and there distributed to the troops.      l?e have considered the matter in the light ofinformation supplied by the Foreign Office, the War Office andthe Ministry of Information, and have reached the following conclusions,2,      SOURCE AND TRANSMISSION OF THE MESSAGEThe article was, originally sent out on Reuter&apos;s AmericanService on the 12th December, and transmitted on the PostOffice wireless beam.      It was subsequently transmitted oh15th December by the same means to the Near East, but it appearsthat the transmission which was picked up in Athens was theearlier transmission.     Like all such Reuter messages it was sent in morse, and although intended solely for the use ofReuter&apos;s overseas subscribers, it could be picked up by anywireless receiving station.      It was not sent under the &quot;ForceRouter&quot; Service, (i,e,  the daily radio service of news ofspecial interest to troops overseas, sent out by Reuters inrespect of which Reuters are paid a fee of  2,500 by the WarOffice),&apos; and consequently it was never approved by&quot;the WarOffice.    According to information supplied by Field MarshalAlexander, . the .message was . &quot;monitored&quot; -f i*e. picked up&quot;, bythe A.I.S. in Athens, i.e. the Anglo-Greek Information Service,apparently on 12th December.3.      CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE MESSAGE WAS DISTRIBUTEDIt has been reported by Field-Marshal Alexander andLt.-General Scobie that the article was included in the Anglo-Greek Information Service Basic News File of 13th December, 1944,The Anglo-Greek Information Service is a branch of the psychological ?ferfare Branch of Allied Force Headquarters in theMediterranean, and its news service contains all the mainnews and comment on Greek and world affairs put out by radio stations and agencies over the air.      It includes impartially* Chairman:- The Minister of Labour&apos;and National ServiceMembers:-   The Minister of production the Minister of Aircraft Production

all comment on the Greek situation received through thesechannels, whether favourable or unfavourable, and-is distributed for information to all the main departments ofGeneral Scobie&apos;s Headquarters, to some unit Headquarters,to the Embassy, and to some Greek Government officials.It is not intended as a bulletin for British troops, but asa source of information for senior officers who may, however,if they so wish, use it, or parts of it, for the informationof troops, and in fact often do so.      It is a continuousproduction appearing at intervals throughout the day6-4*      APPROVAL TO TOIOH THE MESSAGE IAS SUBJECTGENERAL SCOBIE reports that kis attention was drawn, tothe article &quot;at the time of publication&quot;,/ and that he very seriously considered imposing a censorship on any news whichmight he disseminated to troops, hut on consideration he came to the conclusion that as such a censorship was bound to &quot;be noticed, the repercussions at home might be worse than actually to allow the troops to re.ad such sourrilous articles.General Scobie remarks that recently the accredited WarCorrespondent of the Daily Herald in Athens received a signalfrom his Editor asking him if special propaganda methods werebeing employed on troops to make them write letters home-displaying anti-ELAS feeling.      General Scobie has given instructions that in the event of articles of this natureappearing in future they should be published, hut care mustbe taken to see that more reasonable opinions are published at the same time.5.      PRESS AND INFORMATION COMMITTEE IN ATHENSThere is in existence in Athens a Press and InformationCommittee which consists of -The Public Relations Officer (Greece)Representative of Anglo-Greek Information ServiceRepresentative of Press DepartmentRepresentative of Military CensorshipRepresentative of Military Liaison (Greece)Under the chairmanship of the B.G.S.  of General Scobie*sH.Q. (Brigadier Smith-Dorrien), this Committee meets at intervals to co-ordinate the actions of the various branches   &apos;represented,6. ;   STATUS OF A.JY CIMMINGSMr. A,J. Cummings is described in the article as beingReuter&apos;s political commentator.      The War Cabinet have alreadybeen informed that by an accident the words &quot;News Chronicle&quot;were omitted in transmission and that he was not, and had never been, Reuters political correspondent, and that Reutershad undertaken not to quote him in the future.     We are givento understand that while Reuters have agreed that Cummingsshould not be quoted in future on foreign affairs, they mayhowever, use his comments on home-affairs.P This is the expression General Scobie himselfuses.     Presumably it means the time that steps were taken to distribute in Athenscopies of the particular number or- sheetof the Basic News File which contained theCummings article.

7.      FORCE REUTERAlthough as stated above the Cummings message was nottransmitted under the Force Router Service, a1 note supplied by the Secretary of State for War describing that service is attached as an Appendix to this report.8,       conclusions on the evidence submitted to us, our conclusions maybe summarised as follows(a) The source of the Cummings message ascirculated in Athens was Reutersoverseas service.      It was nottransmitted in Reuters special serviceof news for the troops,(b) The message was picked up by the Anglo-CreekInformation Service (which is a branch ofthe Psychological Warfare Branch of allied force Headquarters, Mediterranean), and included in their Basic News File.     ThisNews File had its ordinary distribution toall main departments of H.Q.  and to someUnit Headquarters.(c) Senior Officers may, if they so wish^ use the News File or parts of it for the Informationof the troops and in fact often do so, butit is not established that any such use ofthis particular article was made,(d) The article came to the notice of General Scobieon its publication in the News File and he decided for the reasons stated in paragraph 4&apos;above not to stop its circulation.(e)The   responsibility for the circulation to thetroops (if any took place) rested with the senior officers who decided to circulate thearticle in question;(f) The responsibility for the appearance of theArticle in the News File rested with the Anglo-G-reek Information service, subject to their control by General Scobie.(g) We recommend that in future the decision as tothe circulation or distribution of such material in areas where difficult political problems arelikely to arise should rest with the properlyconstituted Committee under the Commander-in-Chiefe.g. in Athens the Press and Information Committeeand not with senior officers in the field.(Initialled)   E.B.Chairman, on behalf of theCommittee.Offices of the War Cabinet,S . W&apos;* 1 a25TH JANUARY,  1945.

APPENDIXForce Reuter is a daily radio service of newssent out Toy Reuters which is considered of special interest to troops overseas though it is not such asf Reuters, would ordinarily send to their commercialclients.      Though originally intended for Array news-papers in Middle East and P. A. I.C.. it &quot;hassubsequently &quot;been of great use also to Armynewspapers in the Mediterranean theatre.     A similarservice is sent &quot;by Reuter&apos;s Par East beam for Armynewspapers in India.      2,500 words go to theMediterranean and 1,500 daily go to the Par East.The service was originally arranged in March 1943,hy the Ministry of Information - the charge being on a non profit basis met in the first instance bythe Minister and subsequently recovered from theWar Office..  .     This arrangement was made because at the time there was no War Office branch which arranged forsuch services for Army newspapers overseas.      Sucha branch was, however, set up at the beginning of1944.      As from 27th October last, a. new arrangement was made with Reuters under which the supervision of Force Reuter devolved on the War Office insteadof on the Ministry.     Two military Sub-Editors weremade available f or the Force Reuter Service.     Asfrom 1st January, 1945, Reuters are being paid for this service at the rate of  2,500 per annum.
