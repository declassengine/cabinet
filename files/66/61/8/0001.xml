In the light of the Prime Minister&apos;s Directive on Morale and Welfarein the Far East,t which set a target for the carriage of all letters by air to theForces fighting in the Far East by the 1st March, 1945, the Committee have nowapproved the following arrangements, which represent a considerable improve-ment in the air mail services.
