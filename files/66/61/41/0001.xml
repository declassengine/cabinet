NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. There has been an increase in the number of U-boats operating in U.K.coastal waters, where two ships were sunk during the week.Norwegian Waters.2. A convoy to North Russia from the U.K. was attacked on the 7th by several groups of aircraft when 300 miles N.W. of Trondheim. The aircraftfailed to penetrate the defensive screen and caused no damage : one of them.was shot down. On the previous day a shadowing aircraft had-been destroyed by fighters.Norwegian M.T.B.&apos;s have torpedoed and sunk a large minesweeper or olddestroyer off the Norwegian coast.Baltic.3. Aircraft of Coastal Command attacked enemy warships off Gdynia onthe night 3rd/4th.   (See Air Situation.)Home Waters.4. On the night of the 5th/6th, two groups of E-boats were reported offthe Dutch coast, but bad weather and attacks by our aircraft forced them to turn back. Three E-boats were attacked off Ijmuiden and one of them was sunk or seriously damaged.5. . During the week ending the 4th, the combined British and U.S.discharges through the liberated ports- were approximately &apos; 66,500 men,9,050 vehicles, 335,000 tons of stores, 22,250 tons of petrol, and 68,500 tonsof ammunition.   (U.S. figures were received for six days only.)Mediterranean.Western Mediterranean.6. On the 4th, the French destroyer Le Fortune shelled an enemy barracks and a supply depot on the Riviera coast. U.S. coastal craft attacked a convoy off Spezia and probably sank one- ship.H.M.S. Matchless (destroyer) on the 7th shelled a bridge and enemy troops on the French-Italian frontier.A small Italian torpedo-boat carrying mines ran ashore near Monaco andwas captured.7. During October and November British patrols in the Strait of Gibraltarboarded 181 and 140 ships respectively, the majority of which were Spanish.In November 4,222 bags of mail were removed for examination from onePortuguese and nine Spanish mail-steamers : 7,862 bags of censored mail wereforwarded.Dodecanese.8. H.M.S. Active (destroyer) on the 31st shelled enemy positions on PiscopiIsland.Adriatic.9. On the 29th January coastal craft- off Istria were engaged by enemyE-boats and a destroyer; one M.T.B. was slightly damaged. On the 5th Februarylight forces off Zara fought an indecisive action.East Indies.10. Reports on recent patrols have been received from H.M. submarines asfollows-:  In the Malacca Strait Stygian sank a small tanker and six junks, andThrasher ten junks. Supreme shelled three coasters off Port Blair, Andamans,and drove them ashore badly damaged. Shalimar sank a coaster, three junks,and five oil-laden landing-craft, and damaged four coasters. Spirit off the North coast of Java sank a 600-ton coaster carrying fuel, and shelled and boarded a200-ton coaster : this was found to be a Q-ship and was sunk.
Pacific.11. On the night of the 31st/lst U.S. coastal craft, in conjunction with aircraft, destroyed or damaged 28 small craft in Lingayen Gulf. A U.S. sub-marine-chaser was sunk on the same night when shipping off Batangas beach-head (S. of Manila) was attacked by 25-30 Japanese speed-boats.Anti-Submarine Operations.12. Nineteen attacks were reported during the week, of which 12 were by warships, four by shore-based aircraft, and three by carrier-borne aircraft.The 10th escort group possibly sank a U-boat north of the Shetlands on the3rd, and two days later a U-boat was probably sunk off Lough Foyle by frigatesof the 19th and 23rd escort groups.Enemy Intelligence.13.   An electric torpedo (21-inch) called the spinne, or spider, has been developed by the enemy for the defence of ports and coastal areas.   It has a range of about 6,000 yards and a speed of 30 knots, is launched from a torpedotube or trolley, and is controlled electrically from the firing position through a.fine insulated wire paid out by the torpedo.A midget submarine of the Seehund (two-man) type has been stranded offYarmouth owing to compass failure on the return voyage from its operationalarea off Ramsgate.U-boats.14. More U-boats are reported on outward passage from their Norwegianbases : otherwise there is little change in the U-boat disposition.Enemy Attack on Shipping.15. One British ship and one U.S. ship, both in coastal convoys, were torpedoed and sunk during the week, the former in the Channel, the latter east of the Goodwins.Allied Minelaying.16. Surface craft have laid mines in the Channel and the S.W. Approaches :aircraft laid mines in the Heligoland Bight and in the Western Baltic.One of H.M. submarines laid mines off the Andamans, and aircraft laidmines off the Burmese coast.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.17. No enemy minelaying has been reported during the week. Fourteenmines have been destroyed off the East Coast, 11 in the Scheldt approaches, andthree off Boulogne.Four mines were destroyed in the Gulf of Genoa and four in the Adriatic.The mine totals are 6,341 ground and 8,613 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.18. Between the 1st and 15th January enemy shipping losses through allied action amounted to nine ships of 30,248 tons : in addition 12 ships of 60,197 tons were damaged.One of the two incomplete cargo ships building in Rotterdam has been sunk by Dutch saboteurs.Despite the withdrawal of war risk insurance facilities for Swedish shipstrading with Germany, three ships totalling 25,000 tons are still employed in this traffic. German ships may still sail to Swedish west coast ports, but the ports inthe Baltic and the Gulf of Bothnia have been closed to foreign snipping since theend of September.19. It is reported that 40,000 tons of coal are to&quot;be .shipped to germany from the Danish emergency stocks, and.that similar orders have been sent to holland and Norway.   These are required to replenish stocks of bunker coal in[29207] b
North German, ports which are short owing to the interruption of the Dortmund-Ems canal, the loss of the Silesian coalfields, and the heavy demands being madein connection with the evacuation of the East Baltic ports.During the week ending the 3rd some 55,000 tons of transports arrived in denmark from ports, in Southern Norway.MILITARY SITUATIONWestern Europe.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.20. Strong French and U.S. forces have captured Colmar and cleared mostof the enemy pocket remaining west of the Rhine in that area; resistance hasnot been strong. In the Ardennes, U.S. forces have advanced steadily in thesectors west of Prum and of Blankenheim, and are there fighting in or behind the Siegfried Line defences.Southern Sector.21. The First French Army has now cleared most of the German pocketwest of the Rhine. A strong U.S. force captured Colmar on the 3rd and alsoreached a point within 2 miles of the Rhine at Breisach. This manoeuvre forcedthe enemy to evacuate the whole of the northern portion of their pocket, andthe French forces in that area quickly pressed forward to the Rhine, beingdelayed only by minefields and booby traps. By the 5th, the French forces fromMulhouse joined hands with those driving from the north, and only scatteredenemy elements remained in the foothills of the Vosges. French and U.S. forces are now clearing the small bridgehead remaining east of the Mulhouse-Colmarroad.East of Haguenau the Seventh U.S. Army has regained a bridgehead overthe Moder and recovered some ground to the east, towards the Rhine. these operations met strong resistance but otherwise the enemy has merely been con-consolidating his previous gains.Central Sector.22. On the 7th, U.S. forces opened a small attack in the area east ofEchternach and activity has also flared up west of the town. West of Prum, U.S.forces have advanced steadily, still in difficult conditions, and have pierced the outer defences of the Siegfried Line in the vicinity of the Schnee Eifel, heavilywooded and high ground 3J miles west of Prum. Further north, the First U.S.Army has completed most of the operations to secure the Roer dams in the areaNW. of Blankenheim.Northern sector.23.. There is nothing to report from the British and Canadian Army sectors.Eastern Europe.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.24. The Russian offensive has continued to develop satisfactorily althoughthe speed of the advance has somewhat slackened since the opening stages and therecent thaw. The most marked progress has been westwards towards the Oderopposite Berlin and across the Oder S.E. of Breslau.Latvia.25. On the 3rd, the Germans reported a renewal of attacks by the Russians :no confirmation of these reports has been received from Russian sources.East Prussia.26. The Russians have closed in further upon Konigsberg especially onthe SW. side where they reached the Baltic coast. They have also advanced intothe Samland Peninsula which has now been almost cleared of enemy.On the south side of the province General Cherniakovsky&apos;s troops have advanced steadily northwards on a fairly broad front north and NW. ofAllenstein. Further German attempts to break out to the west have beenfrustrated.
Central Sector.27. The fortress of to run has been stormed after having been&quot; completelyencircled; Schneidemuhl, where there has been bitter fighting, has been by-passed.The garrison of Poznan still holds out.The Russians, after capturing Landsberg at the end of January, reachedthe Oder opposite Kustrin and Frankfurt in the early days of the month. since then they have considerably broadened their frontage on the river especiallytowards the north. They have also approached appreciably nearer to Stettin byadvances north and N.W. of Landsberg. S.E. of Frankfurt the Oder has beenreached over a considerable distance while S.E. of Breslau the Russians haveforced the river on a 50-mile front to a depth of some 15 miles.There has been some further progress S.W. of Katowice where the Russiansnow hold more than half of the industrial area.Southern Sector.28. The enemy garrison of Budapest is still holding out although, the areaof Buda which it still retains is being gradually reduced.In the area between Budapest and Lake Balaton the Russians have counter-attacked heavily and much reduced the area gained by the Germans in their recentattacks S.E. of Szekesfehervar towards the Danube.Burma.29. Our troops on Ramree Island have crossed to the east coast in anunopposed drive. They are still held up on the north bank of the YanbaukChaung. A landing has been effected on the southern tip of Ramree by a detach-inent from our forces on Cheduba Island. On Cheduba Island itself, the town ofCheduba has been occupied.Japanese thrown back from the Myohaung-Minbya area are being pursuedsouthwards. The enemy has launched further energetic counter-attacks,supported by artillery, against our Kangaw perimeter, suffering nearly 2,000killed and losing 20 guns.In the area west of the Chindwin, our forces have made progress, reachingpoints twenty-three miles south of Tilin and eighteen miles S.W. of Pauk : no opposition has been encountered. They have now cleared the northern bank of theIrrawaddy west of Mahdalay, from Myinmu to a point ten miles to the east.After a short lull, the enemy has launched further attacks against our bridge-heads on the Irrawaddy at Kyaukmyaung and Thabeikkyin. The Japaneseartillery fire at Kyaukmyaung is the heaviest so far encountered in Burma.In Northern Burma, our troops are within thirteen miles of Mong Mit.Chinese troops have reached a, point nineteen miles north of Namtu. A Japanesecounter-attack in the area fifteen miles S.E. of Namhkam achieved some initialpenetration but was later repulsed.China.30. On the 3rd, Japanese troops occupied Namyung, and continued, to advance eastwards. Another Japanese column, moving southwards fromSuichuan, occupied K a nohow.Philippines.Luzon.31. In central Luzon, U.S. forces entered Manila on the 4th; the first toenter the city was a column of 1 U.S. Cavalry Division. This Division, aftercapturing Cabanatuan, made an extremely rapid thrust southwards andapproached Manila from the east, after a wide encircling movement. shortly afterwards 37 Infantry Division, pressing forward from the San Fernandoarea, reached the northern suburbs of Manila. On the 1st, elements of 11 U.S.Airborne Division made an unopposed landing at Nasugbu, S.W. of Manila,and advanced inland towards Tagatay. Tagatay Ridge was secured by furthertroops of 11 U.S. Airborne Division in a parachute jump on the 3rd. these forces then made a rapid advance along the road northwards to Manila againstlight opposition, and reports state that they are now engaged in mopping-upoperations-in-the south of the city.[29207] . B 2
Communiques state that some 5,000 prisoners and civilian internees inManila have been liberated.The U.S. troops which landed on the west coast of Luzon in the San Narcisoarea have advanced east from Olangapo and joined hands with the main forcesin the area S.W. of San Fernando. They therefore now control all the roadsleading into the Bataan Peninsula.Japanese casualties up to the 4th February number 16,685 killed and 215prisoners of war.AIR SITUATION.&quot;Europe.United Kingdom.32. Fighter Command flew 65 defensive sorties. Attacks against long-rangerocket sites are referred to in para. 34, while details of enemy rocket activityagainst this country are reported under &quot; Enemy Activity and Home Security.&quot;Home Waters.33. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 727 sorties; two aircraft are missing.On the night 3rd/4th 14 Liberators of Coastal Command attacked 4 U-boats,a destroyer and a coaster off Gdynia in the Western Baltic; the observation of results was difficult.Aircraft of Bomber Command laid 281 sea-mines.Western Europe.34. During the week-ended dawn on the 7th aircraft of S.H.A.E.F. (Air)flew 8,713 sorties and dropped 4,179 tons of bombs. In the week ended dawn onthe 8th, Bomber Command and the U.S. VIII Bomber Command flew 9,189 sorties and dropped 22,441 tons, while Fighter Command and the U.S. VIII fighter command flew 3,499 sorties. Forty-seven enemy aircraft were destroyed and14 damaged; 169 Allied aircraft are missing. Allied aircraft flew 860 sortiescarrying supplies to the Continent.Bad weather during the week again restricted operations.In the battle areas bombers of S.H.A.E.F. (Air) operated against enemymovements, defended positions, road and rail communications and other targets,on which over 2,000 tons were dropped. Fighters and fighter-bombers continuedto provide support for Allied troops and carried out many armed reconnaissances,particularly in the central and southern sectors. More than 300 locomotives,2,800 railway vehicles, 1,200 M.T., 50 A.F.V. and over 500 buildings were destroyed or damaged. Railways were cut in about 200 places and highways in about 50.Targets combining industrial areas and railway facilities which were heavily bombed by night included Ludwigshafen (1.656 tons), Mainz (1.010 tons), Siegen(1,239 tons), Wiesbaden (2,028 tons) and Bonn (849 tons). Communications were also attacked at Munchen Gladbach (714 tons), Mannheim (706 tons) and Weselroad and railway bridges (340 tons). All these targets were bombed throughcloud but at Ludwigshafen, Mainz and Wiesbaden the glow of many fires couldbe seen. At Goch and Cleve 477 and 1,396 tons respectively were dropped by night from below cloud in good concentrations, which caused many fires.Industrial targets were attacked by heavy bombers by day and night. Amongthese the principal targets were synthetic oil plants at Wanne-Eickel (two attacks 627 tons) and Magdeburg (240 tons); benzol plants at Osterfeld(321 tons) and Nordstern (344 tons); coking plants at Bottrop (976 tons) andDortmund (573 tons); and the industrial centre at Karlsruhe (1,097 tons). Inmost cases cloud prevented the observation of results, but at Bottrop andDortmund the weather was clear and bombing was seen to be well concentrated.Railway centres received attention in daylight attacks. Bombing was againmainly through cloud, notably at Magdeburg (two attacks 1,161 tons), Chemnitz(796 tons), Gotha (193 tons), Mannheim (194 tons), Ludwigshafen (183 tons) andCrefeld-tXrdingen (92 tons). On the 3rd, however, the weather enabled someaircraft attacking railway centres at Berlin to bomb visually; 2,026&apos; tons were released and results were reported as good to excellent.
Some enemy opposition was encountered by fighters escorting the heavies to berlin and Magdeburg, although this was not heavy taking into consideration thata force of over 1,000 bombers attacked these two targets. Twenty-one enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat for the loss of 8 fighters, while 23 bombers weremissing.Small-scale attacks were made on other targets, including Berlin, which was bombed by a total of 167 Mosquitoes on two nights.Lancasters attacked the Dortmund-Ems Canal at Ladbergen by night.Delayed-action bombs (829 tons) were dropped and results could not be observed.Lancasters attacked midget U-boat and E-boat pens at Poortershaven (nearMaasluis) and Ijmuiden respectively. Eighteen 12.000-lb. bombs were releasedon the former target and several direct hits obtained, while at the latter 17delayed-action bombs of the same calibre were dropped; a fair concentration isbelieved to have been obtained.Although bad weather prevented some aircraft from attaining their primaryobjectives, Spitfires of Fighter Command and S.H.A.E.F. (Air) obtained anumber of direct hits on long-range rocket sites in Holland; on one occasionresults were reported as. excellent. Rocket transportation targets were also attacked effectively.. Enemy offensive activity in the battle area was on a negligible scale duringthe week.Note. Appendices VII and VIII give Raid Assessments and OperationalStatistics respectively.Southern Europe.35. In the week ended dawn on the 6th aircraft of the M.A.A.F. flew8,709 sorties, of which 2,336 were by heavy bombers, and dropped 5,266 tons of bombs.   Fifty-seven Allied aircraft are missing.Bad weather restricted operations on several days of the week.Italy.36. Aircraft of the Tactical Air Force operated against communications and other targets, and gave support to Allied troops in the battle area. Excellentconcentrations of bombing were obtained when a force of 174 Mitchells attacked5 bridges on the Brenner route and in N.E. Italy; hits were obtained on four ofthe targets. Other bridges and railway centres at Calliano (10 miles S. ofTrento) and in the Mori/Rovereto/Piacenza areas were also successfully bombedlater in the week.Fighters and fighter-bombers attacked road and rail transport and destroyed or damaged over 90 locomotives, 570 railway wagons, and 430 M.T. railways were cut in 87 places and a number of railway bridges destroyed.Austria and Germany.37. Heavies of the. Strategic Air Force twice attacked an oil refinery atMoosbierbaum (23 miles W.N.W. of Vienna), a total of 1,359 tons being droppedwith good results. At Regensburg an oil storage area received 1,003 tons,dropped on pathfinder technique with unobserved results.Railway centres attacked during the week included Graz, which was visitedon two occasions (432 tons); results were reported as good on the first attack, butcloud prevented observation on the second. Hits on the railway and main station were observed in an attack on Salzburg (146 tons), while other similar targets wereRosenheim, Strauburg (S.E. of Regensburg) and Villach; at the last-mentioned agood concentration was obtained.Yugoslavia.38. Aircraft of the Balkan Air Force attacked railway and other targets inthe Zagreb/Maribor area, destroying or damaging bridges and a number ofrailway wagons. Strategic heavies also successfully bombed the railway centre at Maribor. ,Russia.39. Weather conditions have greatly restricted operations by the Soviet AirForce during the week, and there appears to have been no general or sustained
air effort. On some days, however, there was considerable activity between theOder and Berlin and, on the Hungarian front, on the right bank of the Daoiube.No operations by the long-range bomber force have been reported. In theBaltic the Soviet Fleet Air Arm report the sinking of three enemy supply ships and a tanker.Far East.Burma, Siam and Malay Peninsula.40. During the week ended dusk on the 5th, Allied aircraft flew 4,242sorties, including 2,927 by bombers and fighter-bombers. In addition, Dakotatransport aircraft flew 5,136 sorties carrying 8,139 tons, and light transport aircraft flew 3,178 sorties, carrying 1,024 men and evacuating 961 casualties andmen.   Four Allied aircraft are missing.In Arakan, some 500 sorties were flown by Hurricanes and Thunderbolts insupport of Allied troops in the vicinity of Myebon and Minbya. Direct hits weremade on enemy gun positions and fires started in many villages.In Central Burma, 70 Liberators dropped approximately 270 tons in goodconcentration on an area near Kyaukse (S. of Mandalay) believed to be an enemyheadquarters. Other Liberators attached a stores area at Madaya,. Tacticalaircraft operated by day and night against various targets in the Mandalay area.Direct hits were obtained on the runways at Meiktila, Heho Aungban, Thedawairfields; and bridges near Mytinge. Near Singu, gun positions and petroldumps were destroyed. On the railway between Thazi and Toungoo severalbridges were damaged, and at Loilem oil fires were started.In the North Shan States, attacks were made against airfields at Mogok,Lashio and Kunlon and stores dumps in the Hsenwi/Namshan areas. Liberatorsin attacks on bridges in Siam dropped 116 tons on the railway bridge atJumbhorn and obtained a direct hit on the main bridge at Kanchanaburi (N. ofBangkok).A force of 104 Super-Fortresses based in India- dropped 179 tons, from17,000^20,000 feet, on the large floating dock and dry docks at Singapore, and30 tons on the pier and storage area at Georgetown (Penang). photographic reconnaissance showed the floating dock very low in the water on ian even keel,but with workshops and cranes above water; some damage to the structure was apparent.  In the harbour one 460-ft. ship was partially submerged.Japan.41. One hundred Super-Fortresses attacked industrial targets at Kobe andother targets. 352 tons of incendiaries and 17 tons of fragmentation bombs were dropped from 25/28,000 feet in 4/10th to 10/10th cloud. Results were excellentand many fires were started.. Fighter opposition was slight to moderate and three enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat.   One Super-Fortress crashed in the sea.One to three Super-Fortresses operated on several nights against oil targets at Tokyo and the towns of Nagoya and Osaka.Several attacks were carried out against airfields on Formosa, and Liberatorsdestroyed 65 enemy aircraft at Heito and Okayama; fighters on sweeps destroyed16 in combat. In attacks on shipping, four small ships were sunk off theSakishima Group and fires started in a tanker off the Pescadores Islands.Pacific.42. In the Philippines (Luzon), the main effort was directed againstCorregidor, Carabao and Cavite in Manila Bay. Some 450 sorties were flown by Liberators against these targets in daily attacks, and approximately900 tons were dropped. On one day, two groups of Liberators operated againstCorregidor and in an attack on Carabao hits were obtained on the radio station.Attacks were also made by medium bombers against enemy positions at Palavera,speed boat hideouts in the Balayan and Bastagan areas, and supply dumps atBaler Bay.Small ineffective night attacks were made by enemy aircraft in the LingayenGulf area.In Borneo, small attacks by Liberators were carried out against the oil refinery at Balikpapan, and war hawks and Beaufighters destroyed buildings and warehouses in the north-east of Celebes. Liberators in an attack on shippingnorth of Flores obtained a direct hit on a 1,000-ton ship.
In New Britain, attacks were made on float-plane hideouts at Vunakanauand Simpson&apos;s harbour (Rabaul) ; several attacks were made on enemy positions at Wewak in New Guinea. I wo Jima in the Kazans was attacked many times by liberators and Lightnings, and on one day 30 Super-Fortresses dropped 160 tons.43. During this period 48 long-range rockets fell on land. The chiefcharacteristic was the concentration achieved, about 70 per cent, of them beingwithin a 12-mile radius.There were 29 incidents in London; outside London there were 13 in Essex,3 in Hertfordshire and 2 in Kent.Only 4 incidents were important, of which the most serious was in theLondon area and caused 30 fatal casualties.Casualties.44.

Photographs taken on &apos; 3rd Feb. after the bomber command attack on 22nd/23rd Jan. show very severe damage throughoutVereinigte Stahlwerke A.G., almost every major building having been hit.Important buildings seriously affected include the refractory brick plant, the gasgenerator plant, the Martin steel shop, the Thomas steel shop and conveyor, theplate shop, a slag mill, a cooling tower, rolling mills, gas generators, gas engines,blast furnaces and many unidentified buildings.In the Coking Plant, three out of five batteries are dismantled and oneseverely damaged, while damage has also been caused to the Benzol Scrubbingplant, the Menthol distillation plant and one exhauster house. Productivecapacity has been greatly reduced.In addition two gas-driven power stations and four cooling towers have been severely affected.Duisburg IRheinhausen Rail Bridge. Photographs taken on 3rd Feb. showthat, as a result of recent U.S.A.A.F. attacks, a section of the road-bed about two-thirds the width of the bridge has been knocked out and both railway lines cut.The bridge is impassable to traffic.Hohenbudberg Railway Centre. -Photographs taken on 3rd Feb. show alarge concentration of craters in the north and south reception sidings caused bythe U.S.A.A.F. attack on 28th Jan. In both these sidings many tracks have been cut and a large number of wagons damaged. In addition the large wagon repairshops have been affected, three small buildings in the vicinity destroyed or damaged, and a long shed in the locomotive depot partially destroyed. the through running lines have been cut in five places.CrefeldI Uerdingen Railway Centre. ^Photographs taken on the 3rd Feb.show that the attacks by Bomber Command on 29th Jan. and by the U.S.A.A.F. on1st Feb. have inflicted heavy damage in the sorting sidings, where at least .66craters have cut tracks and where a large number of wagons have been destroyed or damaged. The wagon repair shop and the engine depot have both been damaged, while in the goods depot three large transhipment sheds have suffered severely. The rail over road bridge between the sorting sidings and the goodsdepot has been heavily hit and two double-track spans destroyed.There is considerable business and residential damage north and south ofthe marshalling yard.Holland.Poortershaven. Photographs taken on 4th Feb. show that the bomber command attack with 12,000-lb. bombs on 3rd Feb. caused very heavy damage to the midget U-boat shelters. The devastation has affected every installation inthe area, and of the four large buildings east of the basin the largest has been pratically destroyed, another very severely damaged and the remaining twoheavily affected by blast. A large crater at the east end of the mole hassevered it from the mainland, and the section of wharf opposite this crater hasbeen forced out of alignment. To the north the electrified railway betweenMaasluis and Van Holland has been cut in three places.[29207]c
