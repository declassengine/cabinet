(45) 79.2nd February, 1945.WAR CABINET.REALLOCATION OF MAN-POWER, BETWEEN THE FORCES and civilian EMPLOYMENT DURING ANY INTERIM period between THE DEFEAT OF GERMANY AND THE DEFEAT of japan.TREATMENT OF SEAMEN ON T. 124 AGREEMENT.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.I attach as an Annex a report submitted by the Chairman of the Inter-departmental Committee on Release from the Forces and Civil&apos;Defence services which was set up by a decision of the War Cabinet on the 17th February, 1944(W.M. (44) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 2, Conclusion (2)). It relates to the positionof men serving in auxiliary war vessels which are commissioned as His Majesty&apos;s ships under a special agreement known as the T. 124 agreement.2. These men are subject to the Naval Discipline Act, and their conditionsof service are in all respects similar to those in the Royal Navy except that they receive mercantile marine rates of pay. The recommendation is that they should,on release after the end of the European war, be granted release leave on thesame scale as general service personnel, viz., 56 days. It is not proposedthat they should receive cL war gratuity. The men to whom it is intended that thisproposal should apply can be clearly distinguished from men on ordinarymercantile marine engagements.3. I am of opinion that these men should receive release leaves on the same basis as members of the Armed Forces, and accordingly suggest to my colleagues that the recommendation be approved.E. B.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,2nd February, 1945.Copy No.  ej QANNEX.INTERDEPARTMENTAL   COMMITTEE&quot; ON  RELEASE   FROM  THEFORCES AND  CIVIL DEFENCE  SERVICES.Service under T.124 Agreement.Report by the Chairman.THE Services Sub-Committee of the Interdepartmental Committee onRelease from the Forces and Civil Defence Services has recently considered aproposal made by the Admiralty, with the support of the Ministry of war transport, that men signed on Agreement T.124 and its variants (including theCommissioned Cable Ship Agreement) should, on release, be granted releaseleave on the same scale as general service personnel, viz., 56 days. It was not proposed that they should receive a war gratuity.[29172]
2. The T.124 Agreement is an arrangement whereby officers and men engageto serve under the Naval - Discipline Act in auxiliary war vessels which arecommissioned as His Majesty&apos;s Ships. Although men serving under this agree-ment differ from general service naval personnel in that they receive civilianrates of pay, they wear naval uniform and perform combatant service similar tothat of naval personnel. They are all volunteers, the agreement is for the duration of the emergency and,un fact, most of their service has been in foreign waters.Some 10,000 ratings and 2,000 officers are involved.3. The Sub-Committee decided to recommend that, men on T.124 Agree-ment or its variants should receive release leave on the&apos;- same scale as general service personnel. This recommendation was made in view of the following considerations : (a) Although on mercantile marine rates of pay, officers and ratings onT.124 Agreements are liable for the full range of naval duties,including combatant duties, performed by corresponding jiersohnelserving in the Royal Navy. This distinguishes them from other categories of men in the Services who are receiving civil fates of pay.(b) The Ministry of War Transport state definitely that the adoptionof the proposal would not lead to claims for similar treatment onbehalf of men on ordinary mercantile marine engagements whichwould be difficult to resist. A distinction has already been drawn forthe purposes of the Reinstatement in Civil Employment Act which applies to men on T\124 Agreements but not to men on ordinarymercantile marine engagements.(c) The release leave payment would be at the basic rate, excluding war riskmoney and pay for higher acting rank, and would not be disprd-poftionate to the leave payments received by other members of theForces.(3) There would be no danger of the men receiving at the same time bothrelease leave payments and payment from the Merchant Navy Poolsince they will not be reinstated in. the Pool before the end of their release leave.4. It is considered that the approval of Ministers should be obtained beforethe recommendation is put into effect.
