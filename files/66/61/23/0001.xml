THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (45) 68.2$th January, 1945.0?aWAR CABINET.PRISONERS OF WAR AND CIVILIANS LIBERATED BY THE soviet forces AND BY THE ALLIED FORCES IN NORTH-western and SOUTHERN EUROPE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.A difficulty has arisen over the question of British prisoners of war liberatedby the Soviet Forces about which I feel that the War Cabinet should be consulted.2. Early in December His Majesty&apos;s Government proposed to the SovietGovernment a- reciprocal agreement to cover British prisoners of war liberated bythe Soviet Forces in the pre-surrender period and Russian prisoners of warsimilarly liberated by the Allied Forces in the pre-surrender period and held in north-Western and Southern Europe. The question whether liberated civiliansshould, be included in the exchange of notes or form the subject of a separate agreement was reserved for further consideration.3. On the 20th January Mr. Balfour was informed that the Soviet Govern-ment were prepared to conclude an agreement on these lines, but that in theiropinion it should be extended to all liberated Soviet citizens and British subjects.Mr. Balfour was handed a Russian counter-draft which has been examined by theWar Office and Foreign Office in consultation with a representative of SupremeHeadquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force. The comments of Allied ForceHeadquarters, Mediterranean, have also been invited.4. With the approval of the Secretary of State for War I have informed the Soviet and United States Governments that I attach great importance to reaching final agreement between the three Governments as soon as possible andthat, in my opinion, this should be done at the impending Conference.5. The number of Russian civilians in German hands who may be liberatedby S.H.A.E.F. and A.F.H.Q. runs into hundreds of thousands, and I considerthat, if we are to secure the Soviet Governments consent to an agreement aboutprisoners of war, it must be extended to civilians. The Soviet counter-proposalsseem to me to be generally acceptable with the possible exception of Article 5,which reads as follows : &quot; Ex-prisoners of war (with the exception of officers) and civilians ofeach of the parties may, until their repatriation, be employed on work in furtherance of the common war effort in accordance with agreements to bereached between the competent Soviet and British authorities. The questionof payment and conditions of work shall be determined by agreement between those authorities.&quot;6. To concede that our ex-prisoners of war should pending their repatria-tion be made to work for the Russians in Russia appears to me to be generallyundesirable. If our men were made to work in harsh conditions when they arenot yet physically fit, there would be public criticism. On the other hand, it isimportant to go as far as possible to meet the Russians on this point. At the instance of the Prime Minister the War Cabinet decided last July(W.M. (44) 91st Conclusions, Item 6, of the 17th July) to propose to the SovietGovernment that the Russians now in this country should be employed on agri-cultural work.   The draft agreement for Soviet nationals in the United Kingdom12655   [29135]
which we have presented in Moscow accordingly contains an article which reads as follows : &quot; These Soviet citizens shall, pending their return to the Soviet Union,be employed on such work in furtherance of the common war effort as maybe agreed between the competent British and Soviet military authorities.&quot;It is clear from this that we have already laid down the principle that liberatedSoviet nationals may be put to work in this country, and it is to be expected thatthe Soviet Government will in this as in other matters.insist.on strict reciprocity.Moreover, I understand that S.H.A.E.F. have experienced serious difficulty in maintaining proper control over the large number of liberated Russians for whom they are now responsible, and that they will insist on the right to put to worknot only these but the very much larger number of Russians who may in the nearfuture be uncovered.7. On the whole, it appears to me that, having already laid down the &apos;principle, we should concentrate upon protecting our men from abuses by ensuring that the conditions of work are tolerable and upon taking all practicable stepsto bring about their repatriation with the least possible delay. As regards thelast point, the Soviet counter draft contains a clause which imposes on each partythe obligation to use all means at its disposal to ensure the quickest possiblerepatriation of the nationals of the other party. I accordingly ask for the WarCabinet&apos;s approval of action on the above lines.A. E.Foreign Office, 29th January, 1945.
