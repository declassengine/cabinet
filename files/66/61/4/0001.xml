THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY-S GOVERNMENTBROADCASTING BY THE B.B.C. EUROPEAN SERVICE OF THEVIEWS OF THE POLISH PEASANT PARTY IN THE UNITEDKINGDOM.Memorandum by the Secretary oe State for Foreign Aeeairs.THE Polish Peasant Party in this country the Party to which m. Mikolajczyk belongs and which, although the largest political party in Poland,is not represented in the present Polish Government-has recently, with thesupport of the Ministry of Information, revived a weekly newspaper in Polish,formerly published in London, called Jutro Polski (Poland&apos;s To-morrow). Inthe few issues of this periodical which have so far appeared a number of declara-tions and articles have been published which clearly represent the official viewsof the Peasant Party and of M. Mikolajczyk himself. These views, as is to beexpected, are critical of the composition and policy of the present Polish Govern-ment and follow a less uncompromising line than the Government on the questionof Polish-Soviet relations.2. References to the new Jutro Polski and to some of the articles whichhave appeared in it were published in the Observer on the 31st December and inThe Times on the 6th January. In the past the B.B.C. European Service has followed the general practice of not quoting in their broadcasts to Poland thePolish Press published in this country. When references to Jutro Polski appeared in the British Press, however, they decided, in consultation with the political warfare Executive, and with my approval, to depart from this practice to theextent of issuing a broadcast drawing attention to the revival of tfhis newspaperas the organ of the Polish Peasant Party, and summarising briefly the views expressed in it. The Polish authorities sought, at the time, to prevent this broad-cast being made, and the Polish Ambassador has since expressed to the ForeignOffice his regret that the Polish Governments wishes in the matter should havebeen disregarded.3. This action of the B.B.C. European Service in giving publicity to theviews Of a Party in opposition to an Allied Government recognised by HisMajesty&apos;s Government sets a precedent which it would clearly be undesirable tofollow in the majority of cases. I consider their action justifiable, however, in thepresent case. It is, I think, desirable that&quot;the people of Poland, who appear to bemore in sympathy with the views of M. Mikolajczyk than with those of the presentPolish Government, should, in present circumstances, be kept informed by theB.B.C. of the relatively moderate policies advocated by the leaders in London ofthe Polish Peasant Party.Printed for the War Cabinet.
