THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1945.SECRET. Copy No,W.P. (45) 88.10^ February, 1945.WAR CABINET.WAR GRATUITIES AND THE WOMEN&apos;S LAND ARMY.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.1. I desire to submit for the consideration of the War Cabinet the case for the award of War Gratuities to members of the Women&apos;s Land Army. *Government Proposals for Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services.2. The Government has already announced its intention of giving a periodof leave on full pay, a civilian clothing outfit, and war gratuities, to men released from service with the Armed Forces. These benefits are to be extended to membersof the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services, with the exception that in lieu of clothinga cash grant will be made; this grant is, in fact, already made to members of theWomen&apos;s Auxiliary Services who are given their discharge.Civil Defence Services.3. The question of a war gratuity for demobilised members of the civil defence Services is raised in the memorandum of the Chancellor of the Exchequer(W.P. (45) 84). That gratuity, if allowed, may have to cover any necessaryexpenditure of ex-members of those services upon new clothing. I submit that there are very strong reasons why comparable treatment should be given tothe Women&apos;s Land Army. No question of a period of fully-paid leave on termina-tion of service arises in the case of the Women&apos;s Land Army, nor in that of theCivil Defence Services.Recruitment.4. Like the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services and Civil Defence, the Women&apos;s land Army was recruited on a voluntary basis at the outbreak of war. TheWomen&apos;s Land Army was included with these other Services in &quot;NationalService &quot; the guide to the ways in which the people might give service - whichwas issued early in 1939.5. It is true that members of the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services and theCivil Defence Services were later frozen in their jobs and that women wereconscripted for them. But the Women&apos;s Land Army volunteer had to undertaketo serve for the duration of the war. To claim that the absence of legal obligation on the Women&apos;s Land Army member is justification for differential treatment in other respects is to regard too lightly the sense of moral responsibility of thewomen concerned. Moreover, Ministry of Labour controls have minimised theimportance of legal attestations, and any woman who, despite her undertaking,leaves the Land Army without the Ministry&apos;s consent is liable to direction totake up work in agriculture.Mobility.6. Like the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services, full mobility is required of theWomen&apos;s Land Army. Its members have to serve wherever they are placed, andin all but a trivial number of cases they are working away from their homes and living in billets or hostels. Civil Defence members for the most part continueto live at their own homes.[29214]
War Risks and Nature of Employment.7. I do not dispute that some members of the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Servicesand of the Civil Defence Services have been exposed to exceptional dangers :nor would I wish to minimise the value of the contribution of members of these services to the&apos; prosecution of the&apos; war. But if personal danger, on gun sites orunder aerial bombardment, is a reason for war gratuities, then any part-timeunpaid volunteers of the Civil Defence Services are equally entitled to considera-tion, while very many members of the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services and of civil defence should be excluded. Few members of the Women&apos;s Land Army havebeen exposed to exceptional war dangers in their work. But it can be justlyclaimed that their work is more consistently exacting and arduous than thatperformed by most members of the other Women&apos;s Services.Conditions of Employment.8. Members of the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services are directly employed bythe State, most of those in the Civil Defence Services by Local Government.Members of the Women&apos;s Land Army, on the other hand, are mainly in privateemployment on farms. But the individual farm vacancies are allocated to themby the Agricultural Departments (through the Women&apos;s Land Army organisation)which also supervise their conditions of work and accommodation. Theiruniforms are provided by the State. Moreover, some 22,000 of them, or over30 per cent., are in the direct employment of the State under the County war agricultural Executive Committees, and a further 4,000 are directly employedby the Ministry of Supply in the Women&apos;s Timber Corps. I suggest that there isno adequate reason here for discrimination against the Women&apos;s Land Army.Rates of Pay.9. Rates of pay for full-time women in Civil Defence are 565. Qd. per week,rising to.64s. 6d. in their third year of service. As Civil Defence pay is equatedto that of the Armed Forces, the pay (including food, lodging and other benefits)of Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services is presumably calculated at about the same figure.The Women&apos;s Land Army receive the minimum wage of 48s. per week (47s. inScotland), and although some may earn a few shillings additional by overtime,there is no doubt that only in exceptional cases can their emoluments amount toas much as those of the other Services. Moreover, the opportunity to obtainadvancement to posts of higher responsibility, carrying higher wages, is smallerin the Women&apos;s Land Army than in either of the other Services. Only the exceptional woman, after long experience, becomes sufficiently skilled to earnsomething slightly above the legal minimum wage. None of them can earn sumsat all comparable with those gained by the majority of women in munitions andother industries.10. I admit that members of the Women&apos;s Land Army are paid the wagecommon to the industry in which they are temporarily serving. Against this, how-ever, must be set (1) the requirement of full mobility, which adds to the livingexpenses of the members, and (2) the fact that the women concerned are givingnational service in wartime in the lowest paid industry. It is safe to say that none of them, but for the war, would have sought employment as farm workers.Their normal peace-time vocations, or any special war-time industry, other thanagriculture, that they might have selected, would have proved substantially moreremunerative than their present occupation.11. After payment for board and lodging, clothing (other than- uniform),travelling, recreation, medical attention, &amp;c, it is out of the question that any sum can be set aside to provide for civilian clothing on termination of service, orotherwise to give the member a new start in life.12. I accordingly ask my colleagues to give the most sympathetic considera-tion to the proposal that members of the Women&apos;s Land Army should be given a war gratuity, comparable to that given to the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services, but without the period of leave with full pay that women in those Services are toreceive. I cannot believe that the inclusion of the Women&apos;s Land Army, whichthe general public look upon as a National Service, would lead to any reper-cussions among workers in war industries. Nor do I feel any apprehension thata gratuity to Women&apos;s Land Army members, which could be justified on the scoreof mobility, would increase the agitation for higher wages among regular farmworkers.
Probable Effects of Refusal of Gratuities.13. In my view there is a very strong case in equity for the Women&apos;s land army. But I feel bound to point out to my colleagues that a rejection of theclaim may also have consequences embarrassing to food production. The women of the&apos; Women&apos;s Land Army are becoming increasingly dissatisfied at theirexclusion from alb welfare schemes announced for various services upon termina-tion of engagement. They are to receive no right to reinstatement in civil employment. They rank below the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services and civil defence in the scheme for higher education and training. The reconstruction committee have decided upon their exclusion from the Resettlement grants scheme, which is to be available for the Forces, for Civil Defence members, andfor the Merchant Navy. An early announcement, to that effect, about Resettle-ment Grants, if followed by a further announcement that they will not receivewar gratuities, will inevitably have serious results, which will be greatlyaggravated if women in Civil Defence are given gratuities.14. Recruitment for the Women&apos;s Land Army has already fallen sharplyand, as wastage is high owing to the exacting nature of agricultural work, theenrolled strength of the Land Army has fallen by over 7,000 in the past four months. To some extent this is attributable to their fears that, when their service ends, they will be left high and dry. Most of the members are ready andanxious to give of their best, at a bare living wage, in the national interest; theycould not be expected to rest content if their future is in no way safeguarded.15. The further disappointment which exclusion from both the Resettle-ment Grants scheme and War Gratuities would arouse would not only reduce stillfurther recruitment for the Land Army; it would increase the rate of wastage(many members would probably succeed in getting out on medical grounds) anddestroy the morale of those that remained. Without the willing help of the land army we could neither have succeeded in the food production programme of thepast five years nor hope to succeed in that of the future.An Alternative Proposal.16. Even if the War Cabinet decide that War Gratuities as such shall notbe granted to members of the Women&apos;s Land Army, I think that as a matter of practical necessity there will have to be a grant made to them towards the costof purchasing clothing which they have had neither the necessity nor means to buy during their period of service. I suggest that this grant, whatever it maybe called, should be of the same order as that given to members of the Women&apos;auxiliary Services upon release. In addition, I suggest that an additional/1allowance, calculated on length of service, and perhaps called a &quot;MobilityGrant,&quot; might be granted to bring the total sum received, on final release fromthe Land Army, to about the same figure as that given to the Civil Defence withthe same length of service.17. I should state, however, that in my view this alternative would be lesssuccessful in completely allaying dissatisfaction in the ranks than would be- full recognition of the eligibility of the Women&apos;s Land Army for war gratuities,especially if these are granted to Civil Defence.Women&apos;s Land Army Benevolent Fund.18. I propose to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make a substantialgrant towards the Women&apos;s Land Army Benevolent Funds. Grants of  11,000/have already been made, and a further and larger contribution would enable the funds to give assistance to those members who, had the Women&apos;s Land Armybeen included in the Resettlement Grants scheme, would have been eligible fobassistance under the scheme. &apos;R.
