(45) 6th Conclusions, Minute 2) to consider major issues in that field.2. Our &quot;findings and recommendations are set out in the Summary at paragraph 36 on page 5 of the Report.C. R. A.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,25th January, 1945.Report by the Deputy Prime Minister, Chairman of the Ad Hoc ministerial committee on Supplies for Liberated Areas in Europe.I. Terms of Reference.At their meeting on the 15th January (W.M. (45) 6th Conclusions, Minute 8)the War Cabinet set up an ad hoc Ministerial Committee to report (withoutprejudice to the position of existing Committees) on the major issues arising inthe field of supplies for liberated areas in Europe.2.   The Committee, as finally constituted, consisted of The Deputy Prime Minister (Chairman),The Minister of Production (Chairman of the S.L.A. Committee),The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for War,The Minister of War Transport,The Minister of Food,The Minister of State, and major Desmond Morton, representing the Prime Minister.3. In the discussion leading mp to the appointment of our Committee wewere invited in our Report &apos;(a) to establish conditions in the countries concerned;(b) to make recommendations for action;(c) to set out the effect of such recommendations on the position of thiscountry;(d) to indicate whether there had been any failure on the part of the UnitedStates to implement its undertakings and, if so, what steps were beingtaken to meet the resultant situation. ,,4. We attach (Appendix) a Report on the factual position by a working party of Officials.[29108] b
II. Conditions in the Countries Affected.5. Conditions in the countries liberated or to be liberated are reviewed inparagraphs 36-96 of the Appendix to this paper. As is inevitable, they vary considerably from country to country or between urban and rural areas.Food.6. On the facts stated in the Appendix we are satisfied that there is ashortage of food supplies throughout liberated Europe (particularly in urban areas) which varies from famine level in countries such as Holland and Greeceto a slight overall shortage in France, and a more marked overall shortage in belgium. The shortage of material is greatly aggravated by the breakdown and destruction of means of transport, and to a lesser extent by the strain on an administrative machine dislocated by war and by enemy control.Raw Materials.7. The same is true of raw materials. The shortage in this respect isparticularly marked in France and Belgium. But it exists in a greater or less degree throughout the areas under consideration. As in the case of food, its effectsare aggravated by the internal transport p8. In addition, there is an acute shortage of certain finished goods and, inparticular, blankets and clothing, the demands for which in the liberated areascan only be met to a very limited extent, unless the United States are prepared to allocate more capacity for this purpose.9. The combined effect over the area with which we deal of the shortages ofsupplies of raw materials, of food, and of certain finished products, is of the first importance. We think that it is essential for political reasons, and of highimportance for operational as well as humanitarian reasons, to take all practicable steps to meet it. We set out below the proposals made to that end, and examine whether they are adequate and practicable, and what the effect is on our own position.III. Scale of Requirements and Allocation proposed.Food and Raw Materials.10. We are informed that it is impossible to sub-divide the estimates whichhave been put forward into food and raw materials, save at the cost of greatdelay, and that even then the results could not be relied on.11. The combined demands, which cover France, Belgium, Italy, Greece,Yugoslavia and Albania, and some allowance for liberated Holland, Poland and czechoslovakia, put forward originally totalled some 15 million tons.12.   Of this, some 3 million tons was coal and 3,772,000 tons Civil Affairs,i.e., principally food.  Both these are included in the Military programme.13. The balance of some 8 million tons has been reduced on account ofbottlenecks other than shipping, such as limitation of transportation, to about ,100,000 tons. The Governments concerned and U.N.R.R.A. will now have toconsider which part of their original programme is most urgently needed andshould therefore receive shipping priority. It is not, therefore, at this stagepossible to sub-divide this figure of 4,100,000 tons with any accuracy between food,raw materials and other goods.IV. Are the Supplies of Food and R*w Materials proposed excessive,adequate or insufficient ?14.   The liberated areas are still pressing for supplementary supplies, andnot without reason.15. Two examples will illustrate the position. France before the war on anaverage imported 14 million tons of food, goods and raw materials, and 37 million tons of fuel. The&apos;Germans fed into France during the years of occupation a steady annual average of over 7 million tons of goods, after ensuring that the )internal resources of the country.&quot; and the stocks existing on occupation, wereexploited to the utmost. The French programme, including Civil Affairs, for thefirst half of 1945 is about 3 million tons.
16. Belgium before the Avar had a higher percentage of industrial workersthan any other country in Europe. The effect of the war has been to increase her exports to Germany from 11 per cent, to 51 per cent., and the proportion of hertotal imports by weight from Germany from.11 per cent, to 52 per cent. germany has been feeding in during the war some 5 million tons annually, chiefly forprocessing, in addition to exploiting to the full the existing resources of theC country. We, on the other hand, now propose to put in slightly over a million tons, including Civil Affairs supplies, for the first six months of 1945.17. For food supplies the target adopted by the United Nations is a standardwhich will prevent disease or unrest likely to interfere with military operations.It is represented by a figure of 2,000 calories provided as far as possible from local resources. That figure compares with an average of some 2,800 calories inthis country, and with 2,650 calories suggested in earlier discussions as theminimum to secure a permanent nutritional standard, 2,000 calories will do no more than barely prevent disease and unrest. But even that figure has not yetbeen reached over large parts of liberated Europe.18. The case for providing raw materials is examined in paragraphs 20-25of the Appendix. They are essential if there is not to be a large mass ofworkers without employment with the consequent risk of political and socialunrest. If the raw materials are supplied, industries can be re-established inthese countries which, after a short interval, will reduce the strain on allied supplies, even of food.19. We are ^satisfied that the amounts of food and raw materials proposed are conservative and reasonable, and are the minimum standard needed to preventwidespread unemployment, and a threat to the stability of political and economic life.V. ^Availability of Supply.Effect on United Kingdom Position.Food.20. Accepting that the case for assistance to the liberated areas on the scaleindicated above has been established, the next question is the effect of providingsupply on this scale on our own position.21. The Minister of Food informed us that provided we can choose whatfoods we give the liberated areas to make, up to the calorie level, the food can bemade available at producing centres without materially affecting the position inthis country, but that we cannot let them choose for themselves, because the foodis not available in every case.Raw Materials.22. So far as raw materials are concerned, we consider it possible, in thelight of the advice we have received from the Minister of Production, to supply the requirements accepted for inclusion in the Shipping Survey without materiallyaffecting the position of this country.23.   We deal separately with the question of shipping.VI. Availability of Shipping.Effect on United Kingdom Position.24.   But transport to carry supply is almost as important as supply.25.   The most important recent developments in this connexion are (i) The recent Shipping Survey, which discloses a deficiency of 689 sailingsover the first six months of the present year. That estimate was basedon calculations which do not give full weight to the rate of loss now expected during this period by the Admiralty, and is likely to bemuch too favourable,(ii) The acceptance by the United States Government, consequent on theMinister of State&apos;s negotiations, of the principle of national import programmes, and the making of initial shipping allocations, for liberated areas.26. It was agreed as part of this latter arrangement that the United Statesand United Kingdom agencies concerned should facilitate procurement against such programmes so that supplies would be readily available for shipment.
27. It was also accepted that the deficit revealed by the Shipping Surveycould not be met by minor adjustments and called for decision, at the forthcoming conference of Heads of Governments, pending which the responsible civil andmilitary authorities in the United States and the United Kingdom should consider what recommendations they could make to the Conference to reduce, the deficit either by downward adjustment of programmes or by more effective use ofshipping.28. We have discussed this problem in detail with the Minister -of war transport in terms of its effect on the problem of supplies for liberated areas.He estimates that to bridge the shipping deficit revealed by the Survey and thehigh estimates of loss, an average cut of some 12 per cent, in all civil and militaryprogrammes may be necessary, though he is investigating possible expedients for reducing this figure.29. On present information the United States Chiefs of Staff will resist anyendeavour to cut military programmes. If this view prevailed it would mean that the whole of the deficiency would have to be met from national import andother civil programmes, including our own import programme. On the otherhand, the British Chiefs of Staff hold the view that a minimum of supplies for liberated areas, whether for civil affairs (already in fact included in the militaryprogramme) or for national import programmes, is essential for military reasons and the carrying on of the war.30. If agreement is reached on that hypothesis, the shipping deficit mustbe met either by special expedients such as, for example, extra loading to western europe of United States vessels (which might give an extra 300,000 tons of cargolift a month), or, to the extent that these do not meet the case, by a cut. But a cutcannot, save to a limited extent only, be borne by the United Kingdom import programmes and must therefore be met from some other source.31. , The decision as to how any such cut is to be divided between civilianand military programmes on the one hand, and United States and UnitedKingdom shipping on the other, raises major political and operational issues.It can only be taken at the Conference of Heads of Governments, after discussion between the civilian and military experts. The Minister of War Transportadvises us that this problem must be dealt with as a whole, and that it. would be premature for us to enter into a detailed examination of this question.  We accept this view- uW4d..     \^x^r32. In these circumstances, we recommend that no cut in^ be consideredexcept as part of a review of the situation as a whole. &apos;33. The Minister of State has impressed on us the extreme importance of holding the Americans to their agreement (1) To accept-the principle of national import programmes and allocations of shipping for France and Belgium, and for the remainder of the liberated countries as they fall in. The principle is of greatimportance. It was very reluctantly accepted by the War and NavyDepartments.. (2) That the authorities concerned in the United States as well as in theUnited Kingdom shall consider what recommendations they shall makeat the meeting of Heads of Governments for adjusting the shippingdeficit either by downward adjustment of programmes, or by more effective use of shipping. The American authorities are formallycommitted to that study. It is of the utmost importance that theyshould be held to it.34. We accept the Minister of State&apos;s view on both points, and we supportit for the approval of the War Cabinet.VII. Miscellaneous Recommendations.35. (i) We have considered the proposals made by the Foreign secretary and the Minister of Economic Warfare in W.P. (45) 28 for the supply of certainsmall additional quantities of food, &amp;c, to Norway and to Poland through theblockade. In the case of Norway, we are informed that the General Staff see no objection so long as the food is routed overland from Sweden. In the caseof Poland, they inform us that the International Red Cross cannot be provided
with a safe conduct against air attack for stores going overland. Subject to thosereservations and to any change which recent Russian successes in Poland maynecessitate, we support the proposals.(ii) The Minister of War Transport advises us that the effect, when civilianimport programmes begin, of removing artificial distinctions between militaryand civil shipments, and of spreading military and civil cargo in the same ships,might be to make a saving which, taken in conjunction with other proposed measures, would be of value.&apos; The United States War Department has, however, shown no eagerness toadopt this suggestion, and while the Minister of War Transport proposes to tryby friendly negotiation, to secure its adoption in part if not in whole, it may needdiscussion at the highest level.(iii) We have considered whether the United States Government should be urged to make available for general use some of the ships now used by theAmerican military authorities in Western Europe for. reserve purposes. TheMinister Of War Transport informs us, however, that their present number repre-sents a substantial reduction, and we accept his view that the matter should again be pursued for further reduction.(iv) Delays resulting from administrative difficulties are examined in para-graphs 100-101 of the Appendix to this paper. In the present stringency thereshould be a constant effort to get the maximum returns and to eliminate possiblecauses of delay or waste, and we feel that the departments concerned with the useof shipping should further examine what action is possible.(v) Paragraphs 103-108 of the Appendix discuss whether the United Statescan be regarded as having fallen down on their undertakings in respect of liberated areas. We accept that, while within a limited area there has beenfailure on the part of the United States to discharge their commitments, therehas of late been some improvement. We separately touch on the possibility offuller loading and more economical use of United States ships.(vi) Paragraph 129 (1) of the Appendix recommends that re-planning ofUnited States lorry production might be considered. We agree that the provisionof lorries for Europe is of great importance, and from the long-term point of viewwe think the question might be raised at the Conference.(vii) Paragraph 129 (2) of the Appendix makes proposals for providingreconditioned or damaged vehicles for the liberated areas. The War Office havealready made some progress in this respect, and at our request have undertaken to examine the matter more closely.(viii) We have considered the desirability of asking Premier Stalin tofacilitate the diversion of surplus food stocks from&quot; Eastern to Western Europe(Appendix, paragraph 129 (3)). But desirable as this would be, we see little hope of securing it. and we accordingly make no recommendation.VIII. Summary.36.   Our findings and recommendations are as follows : *(1) There is a shortage of food supplies throughout liberated Europe (par-ticularly in urban areas) varying from famine level in countries suchas Holland and Greece to a slight overall shortage in France andBelgium.(2) There is a similar shortage of raw materials, particularly marked in thecase of France and Belgium.(3) The effects of the shortages of food and raw materials are aggravated bythe breakdown and destruction of internal transport.(4) It is essential for political reasons and of high importance for operational and humanitarian reasons to take all practicable steps tomeet this shortage.   (Paragraph 9.)(5) -The amounts of food and of raw materials proposed to be made availableare already below the desirable figure owing to shortages and difficulties of transport. As they stand we regard them as theconservative and reasonable standard necessary if widespread unem-ployment, and the breakdown of the social life of these countries, andthe military and political consequences that follow therefrom are tobe avoided.   (Paragraph 19.)[29108] c
(6) The Minister of Food advises us that the food can be made available atproducing centres without materially affecting the position in thiscountry, but that we cannot let the liberated areas choose for them--selves, because the food is not available in every case.   (Paragraph 21.)(7) We consider that the raw materials can be made available withoutmaterially affecting the position of this country.   (Paragraph 22.)(8) But shipping is in short supply. There may have to be a further cut tomeet it. This is a matter for examination and decision at the next meeting of Heads of Governments. (The Minister of Food iscirculating to the War Cabinet the paper that he laid before us inthis connection.) In these circumstances we recommend that no cut in the liberated areas programme be considered except as part of a review of the shipping situation as a whole.   (Paragraph 32.)  -(9) We support a recommendation made by the Minister of State in regardto shipping for liberated areas, which is set out in paragraph 33 ofour Report.(10) We support the proposals of the Foreign Secretary and the Minister ofEconomic Warfare (W.P. (45) 28) for providing certain additional supplies through the blockade to Poland and Norway, subject to the comments in paragraph 35 (i) of our Report. &apos;(11) The economies that might be secured by the United States Governmentspreading military and civil cargo in the same ships as civilian import programmes begin would be of value. We commend to the WarCabinet the action which the Minister of War Transport is taking to secure this in part if not in whole.   (Report: Paragraph 35 (ii).)(12) We agree with the Minister of War Transport that the United StatesGovernment should be pressed further to reduce the number of ships now used by the American military authorities in Western Europefor reserve purposes.   (Paragraph 35 (iii).)(13) Everything possible should be done to get the maximum returns, and&quot; eliminate any causes that there may be of delay or waste. (report:paragraph 35 (iv).)(14) On a broad view we do not regard the United States as having fallendown on their undertakings. There has of late been some improvement. (Report: paragraph 35 (v), and Appendix, para-graphs 103-108).(15) We attach importance to the maximum help being given to the liberated areas by the provision of reconditioned or damaged vehicles. TheWar Office have taken certain action and are investigating the matter-further.   (Report: paragraph 35 (vii).) :M(16) Desirable as it would be to ask Premier Stalin to facilitate the diversion of surplus food stocks from Eastern to Western Europe, we see little hope of securing this and accordingly make no recommendation.(Paragraph 35 (viii).)(17) Given the great importance of transport, the question of urging theUnited States Government to re-examine its lorry planningprogramme might be raised at the Conference from the long-termpoint of view.

REPORT .OP THE WORKING PARTY OF OFFICIALS ON supplies for LIBERATED AREAS IN EUROPE.THE War Cabinet at their meeting on the 15th January appointed an ad hocMinisterial Committee on Supplies for Liberated Areas in Europe to consider(without prejudice to the position of existing Committees) the major issues arising in this field.2. The Prime Minister indicated in discussion that he desired the Minis-terial Committee  .  &apos;&quot;     (1) To establish the conditions in the countries concerned;(2) To make recommendations for action;(3) To set out the effect of such recommendations on our own position;(4) To indicate whether there had been any failure on the part of the UnitedStates to implement its undertakings and, if so, what steps were beingtaken to meet the resultant situation.3. A Working Party of officials was appointed by the Lord President ofthe Council, Chairman of the ad hoc Ministerial Committee, to review the positionand prepare a statement for consideration by the Ministerial Committee. TheWorking Party consisted of the Chairman of the S.L.A.O. Committee and repre-sentatives of the Foreign Office. War Office, Ministry of War Transport, Ministryof Production, Ministry of Food and the Cabinet Offices.4.   The Working Party report as follows :  -Introductory.. 5.   It seems desirable at the outset to describe -(1) The distinction between civil affairs supplies and civil supplies for thepost-military period;(2) The basis of relief in liberated countries; and(3) The position of U.N.R.R.A.(1) Distinction between civil affairs sullies and civil supplies for the post-mili-tary period.6. The governing&apos; principles accepted for planning purposes were that military and national authorities should act. on the assumption that theperiod for which the military authorities would be responsible would be ashort one. For planning purposes it was assumed that this period would last for six months (though it might be longer or shorter in practice) and that civil supplies would be procured by the United Kingdom and United States military authori-ties, and so would have operational priority. These supplies would be confined to the so-called five basic commodities, i.e., food (as specifically defined for thepurpose), medical supplies, clothing, soap and fuel. In addition some provision was made for military engineering stores, transport, agricultural machinery and first-aid supplies for public utilities.7. The military responsibility is a joint United States-United Kingdomresponsibility as regards both procurement and distribution.8. Once the military period was over or strategical considerations per-mitted, the military authorities would hand over to the national Governmentsresponsibility for programming, procuring and distributing supplies for the civilpopulations.9. For the post-military period certain standards have been accepted by .N.R.R.A. for relief and rehabilitation supplies: but there is no objection topaying Governments providing import programmes which allow for a higher standard than the U.N.R.R.A. minimum, provided that any such increase doesnot prejudice, in terms of supply or shipping, the programmes of non-payingGovernments, for which U.N.R.R.A. is responsible. In fact, in the case ofFrance and Belgium, which were recovered largely unscorched, the programme isnot a&apos; relief programme but rather one for the rehabilitation of general economy.(2) Basis of relief in liberated countries.10. For the period of military control the standard is that necessary toprevent disease and. unrest to an extent which will interfere with militaryoperations.
11. A figure of 2,000 calories has been adopted for this purpose.; It isimportant to note that that figure does not purport to do more than maintain a minimum standard of living which should prevent disease and unrest. It iswell below the figure required to maintain the normal nutritional standard, andin the earlier discussions on the subject a figure of, say, 2,650 calories was atone stage advocated as the minimum figure for that purpose. It may be compared with the present United Kingdom level of some 2,800 calories.12. The basic principle employed in estimating the needs of liberated countries for imported supplies is that local resources should be used to the fulland only such supplies imported as are necessary to bring&apos;&apos;the resources up to thestandard necessary to prevent disease or unrest.(3) Position of U.N.R.R.A.13. U.N.R.R.A. can operate in any liberated country only if invited by thenational authorities concerned and, during the military period, by the militaryauthorities also. It has been agreed, hoAvever, that in most countries theyshould operate in respect of displaced persons.14. The present position is that U.N.R.R.A. will not play any part in the procurement, shipment or distribution of supplies to France, Belgium, Holland orNorway. In Greece, Yugoslavia and Albania the intention is that the militaryauthorities should, as soon as possible, hand over responsibility for these functions to U.N.R.R.A., and that in the meantime in Greece U.N.R.R.A. should work as distributing agents under the military authorities and without responsi-bility, so as to acquire experience and to ensure continuity.15. In Yugoslavia and Albania internal distribution has been left to thelocal authorities, who are, however, free to invite U.N.R.R.A. to their assistance if they so desire.16. In Italy, U.N.R.R.A. are to do health welf are * and displaced personswork, involving the provision of supplies for this purpose additional to themilitary programme.17. In Czechoslovakia, and in Poland if- the Soviet Government agree,U.N.R.R.A. will have full responsibility for relief and rehabilitation suppliesas soon as shipment- which must be made through Soviet ports, becomes prac-tieable.Countries Covered by Present Report.18.   The countries covered by the present report are as follows :  A. France. Greece.Belgium.                          &apos;   Yugoslavia.Holland. -        Albania.Norway.                              .  Czechoslovakia.^Denmark. Poland.Italy.Russia.B. Ex-enemy countries.Germany. Roumania.Austria. Bulgaria.Flungary.Conditions in Liberated Territories.19. Before considering the individual circumstances of the territories under examination we place on record the general arguments, which apply in greater or less degree to all the countries affected, for increasing the supplies toprovide for them. It should be premised that conditions vary considerably inthe different countries, as will be seen from the analysis below.Reasons for Increasing Supplies to Liberated Countries.20. There are now in Europe 80 million people freed from German control,but at the same time helpless in the face of economic paralysis. Leaving asideconsiderations of honour and charity, it is imperative to examine (a) the extent to which this paralysis, if allowed to spread, would affectthe course of the war and the interests of the United Kingdom andthe United States, and
.(&amp;) how, by economic assistance in the right place, liberated countries couldbe enabled to help in the prosecution of the war and in reducing theamount of relief which has to be provided for them from overseas countries.21. The allied countries of Europe which are still, or.have been, occupiedby the enemy contain nearly 150 million people, and the enemy satellites another100 million. These countries, to a greater or less degree, have developed modernexchange economies. In the more highly developed countries such as France andBelgium, the regular process of transport, - import and export purchases and sales on which they depend cannot be interrupted for more than a short periodwithout consequences of paralysis, unemployment, want, political unrest andunstable government. The economy of these countries was kept going on aminimum scale under German occupation for the sake of what could be got outof them. The Germans fed a steady 7 million tons of goods a year into Franceduring the occupation as against 51 million tons a year of pre-war imports. Onthe limited basis of civil affairs supplies imports, other than coal, into the partsof France and Belgium covered by S.H.A.E.F. between June and November, 1944,were only 120,000 tons.22. Countries with more primitive economies, of which Greece is a goodexample, present other problems. These countries were written off by theGermans as valueless and were starved. Theirs, therefore, is a problem of directrelief. In all these countries, whatever their economies, there are the addeddisasters of direct war damage.23. The economic problems facing the allies in Europe were not ignoredin the military planning of the invasion, and the dangers of unrest as well asdisease were foreseen. The military plans, however, were calculated on the basisof a comparatively short and successful campaign which would not involve thesupport or maintenance of whole economies over a considerable period whilemilitary operations continued. Mainly for lack of ports, the pace of giving effect &apos;to these plans has been slowed down. Thus in France, where internal distribu-tion has been mainly undertaken by the national authorities, their work has been severely (hampered by the destruction of the internal transportation system.24&apos;. Modern economies cannot conveniently be subdivided into small localagricultural cells each of which can look after itself for an indefinite period oiia subsistence ^basis. For a period, given transportation, the community can holdout as long as its food supplies and raw materials last, but sooner or later,without the import of additional materials, the economic machine runs down and unemployment rises steeply. Lack of raw materials will affect public utilities,failure of public utilities will affect industry, and so on; stoppage in one important place will have repercussions which are felt throughout.25. The problem therefore shows itself not as one of direct relief but as theproblem of giving such assistance to key industries as will have the greatestmarginal effect when added to the indigenous resources.26.   Failure to deal with this problem will have two notable consequencesas far as the United States and the United Kingdom are concerned.27. First, the military effort will be hampered. Not only will the countries concerned be unable to make any effective contribution to it, but if, as is only toolikely, unrest and civil disturbances break out, troops will be tied up in maintaining order.28. Secondly, the undermining of governmental authority by economicparalysis will either result in conditions of anarchy or tend to produce absolutistregimes, a consequence not compatible with the purposes for which we are fighting the war. Thus, the possibility of stable conditions in Europe is likely to be post-poned for many years to come, with consequences , extending far beyond theconfines of Europe and tending to prejudice any kind of international collaboration.29. It is clear, therefore, that in their own interests the United States andthe United Kingdom cannot ignore their responsibilities or postpone them untilvictory has been won. Supplies must reach Europe, &quot;but they must be thosesupplies which will produce the greatest returns. Of the first order ofimportance are those which will enable the liberated countries to give direct localhelp, while the war continues, either by supplying the invasion armies or by putting their own troops in the field and supplying them.   To a certain extent
this is being done by the utilisation of French and Belgian productive capacity for repairs and maintenance on an extensive scale, and for such commodities astyres and tubes, textiles and photographic films. In&apos;the second rank come thosesupplies which will enable these countries to take part of their relief burden ontheir own shoulders and reduce overseas imports. For this purpose supplies willbe required at an early stage of such essential agricultural materials asfertilisers, pesticides and some machinery. But the economic life of thesecountries must be treated as a whole, and revived more fundamentally, if evenlimited objectives of supplying Allied armies and easing the burden of relief areto be attained; and, still more, if they are to be made safe as an advanced base for the Allied armiesTransport Position.30. We wish, next, to emphasise the importance of the problem of transport,The greater the effective internal use that can be made of transportation, thegreater the probability of reducing demands for imports from outside and soreducing demands on shipping.31. But in the case of railways, marshalling yards and repair shops havebeen destroyed; there has been great destruction and removal of locomotives andtrucks; lines have been injured; signalling apparatus destroyed.32. Motor transport itself is in very short supply. In addition, the absenceof tyres and of bodies, the destruction of stock and the failure throughout thewar to replace, aggravate the position.33. Canals have been an important target, and destruction of barges,locks, &amp;c, presents a problem which can only be solved over a period.34. The destruction of bridges affects all forms of transport in a greaterdegree, and transport other than railway transport is inevitably affected by suchinjury as has been done to roads.35. The question of coal is of particular importance in this connection. Itis well illustrated by the case of France and- Belgium, where there is an acutedemand and substantial production, but where the absence of transportation(which, of course, also affects the supply of pit-props) is resulting in largeaccumulations at the mines, with a consequent reduction in the interest of theminer in increasing output, while industries and the civil population in otherparts of the country so badly need coal that.it has to be imported from thiscountry, with consequent additional strain on the limited shipping available aswell as on our own resources.Conditions in Individual Countries.36. We now turn to the individual-countries concerned. The position inrespect of them is examined under three heads A.-Food.B. Economic Situation.C. Action in hand.I. France.A.-Food.37. France remains basically self-sufficient in food-stuffs at a minimum levelof consumption, though imports of certain quantities of fats, oils, &amp;c. (most ofwhich are available from her Colonial Empire) are necessary. The real problem is one of internal distribution owing to the dislocation of the means of communi-cation, and for some time still special imports of food-stuffs into the South ofFrance will be necessary. The figures put forward by the French themselves forthe import of food amount only to some 70,000 tons per month for the period ofJanuary to March. S.H.A.E.F.&apos;s estimate is about 50,000 tons per month. Therehave been no serious outbreaks of disease nor any real evidence of malnutrition,and, in the view of the War Office, it may be assumed that, with the importsreferred to above, the average urban standard of food is about 2,000 calories per day, part of which is, of course, obtained in the shape of unrationed food-stuffs orof purchases on the black market. The 1944 crops have on the whole been satisfactory, but sugar is likely to be short owing to the difficulty of processingbeet; difficulty has also been experienced in persuading the farmer to deliver hisproduce to the authorities.  This may be reflected in food shortages later.
B. Economic Situation. . -38.   But the real necessity in France is not so much food, as raw materials.39. The general economic situation is still governed by lack of raw materials,lack of coal and shortage of transportation. Already, wheat has had to bebrought to the southern seaboard of France, since their overseas and northernwheat cannot be transported to them. To ensure that food production continuesthe rehabilitation of the fertiliser industry is essential. The French cotton,wool and textile industries, to take another example, which before the waremployed in one way or another well over 1 million people, were kept going tosome extent during the German occupation by materials imported from central and Northern Europe, particularly pulp for the manufacture of rayon. &quot; these industries are now almost idle, and the political argument for supplying the rawmaterials requisite to enable the essential industries in France to start workagain is a real one, independently of the help they could give to meet the existingworld shortage of such goods as tyres and textiles.C. Action in hand.40. U.N.R.R-.A. as at present arranged does not play any part in the procurement, shipment or distribution of supplies to France.41. Civil affairs supplies will continue to be provided by the military untilthe military authorities agree that responsibility can be taken over by the civil government without risk to military operations. As a result of Mr. Law&apos;discussions in Washington, agreement has been reached on a shipping programme which should enable the major part of the French civilian import programme tobe lifted. More than half of the French import programme during this periodcomes from French Colonial territory, but the national import programme ofabout 3 million tons including coal and Pol has been accepted for planning purposes.   Procurement is proceeding so far as supply is available.II. Belgium.A. Food.42. As reported in W.P. (44) 607, Belgium presents a more difficult problemthan France, since : (a) She never produced more than half of the food which she consumed;(b) a far larger proportion of the country is still under active war conditions;and(c) she has shown less recuperative power, and there has been a much greaterfailure than in France to secure and distribute to the cities the foodproduced in the agricultural districts.43. After the political disturbances of the early winter, the situation hassomewhat improved, but there still remain large stocks of grain in the handsof the farmers who are unwilling to surrender them. It was anticipated thatit would not be necessary to import food before February. But the politicaldisturbances have made necessary small distributions by S.H.A.E.F. during thepast few months. Imports of grain and fats on a larger scale than was expectedwill now be necessary to cover the period until the next harvest, if the existingstandard is to be maintained. It is estimated that at the present moment anaverage distribution of 1,800 to 2,000 calories (including unrationed and black market commodities) is being maintained. Any diminution of this standardor indeed the failure to raise it in the comparatively near future, might well lead to serious disturbances. Import difficulties have been reduced with theopening of the port of Antwerp. There has been no serious outbreak of disease,but the standard of nutrition is not as satisfactory as in France.B. Economic Situation.4A. Belgium in proportion to her size and population is the most highlyindustrialised country in the world. In simple terms she is a workshop processing-materials mainly imported for use in export. Her basic economy is geared tothis form of activity and no other. The case for the re-establishment by a small,compact, densely populated, and highly complex industrial economy such asBelgium of its trading networks on some minimum basis to preserve stabilityis a very strong one. This will entail imports on some scale from overseas.  Before
the war, eight essential commodities (manganese, pyrites, zinc concentrates,copper, wool, cotton, jute and phosphate rock (imported wholly or mainly from overseas) alone accounted for 2 million tons.C. Action in hand.45. For civil affairs requirements (i.e., food) the S.H.A.E.F. programmecontemplates a supply of 500,000 tons over the first six months of 1945.The Belgian Government has been slow in producing six-month import programme for agreement by the Four-Party Committee in Brussels/ Procure-ment has, however, proceeded for a number of commodities in the United Kingdom,North America and. the Belgian Congo. As a result &quot;of Mr. Law&apos;s discussions in Washington, five ships have been allocated for this programme for the first quarter from North America. 30,000 to 40,000 tons of supplies should be ableto be lifted from the United Kingdom and two ships have been laid on to bringsupplies from the Belgian Congo. As regards port capacity, S.H.A.E.F. have put the port of Bruges (suitable for coasters only) at the disposal of the BelgianGovernment, and have indicated that a capacity of approximately 5,000 tonsa day will be available from the 1st February.The shipping arrangements described in the preceding sub-paragraph cover the proposals reported to the Prime Minister by Mr. BevinJs Committee.46. The clothing situation is serious in Belgium and will vary from poorto desperate everywhere.47. U.N.R.P.A. will not play any part in procurement, shipment ordistribution of supplies to Belgium.III. Holland.A.-Food.48. (1) Liberated Areas. Even in the liberated areas the fact that theyare still a&apos;battlefield, and the lack of any Dutch port, have made it extremelydifficult for the military authorities to deal effectively with the situation. For atime the rations available provided only 800 to 1,000 calories. An average of1,600 calories is now being made available,&apos; and it is hoped that this can be improved when some reserve has been accumulated, particularly as fishing hasrecommenced in the estuary of the Scheldt.49. (2) Occupied Areas. The situation is reported to be still more grim.Supplies have been severely restricted by the Germans, and there is a completeabsence of stocks. We have, however, recently agreed to allow two Swedish ships(which may be followed by others), carrying supplies, to pass the blockade. Atthe best, however, the situation immediately on liberation will call for largequantities of supplies, and for special arrangements for their distribution. plans are being made by S.H.A.E.F. to this end. At the worst, and if the greaterpart of Western Holland is flooded owing to the destruction of the dykes by theGermans, a disaster of the first magnitude affecting 3^ million people will haveto be faced.B. Economic Situation.50. The economic situation in Holland is complicated by the fact that the mother country and its colonies have always represented an. integrated economy.The severance of the Netherlands from their overseas possessions, coupled withthe loss of the important Netherlands transit traffic, thus give rise to problemsof peculiar acuteness. The immediate demand on liberation will be for reliefgoods food, clothings medical stores and then probably for facilities to maintainpumping. There can be no question that the need for raw materials on liberationwill thereafter be very great, but its magnitude must turn largely on the extent offlooding and destruction organised by the Germans before they evacuate.C. Action in hand.51. U.N.R.P.A. will not play any part in procurement, shipment ordistribution of supplies in Holland.52. A programme of 150,000 tons civil affairs requirements (food) for thewhole of Holland for the first two quarters of 1945 has been approved.The question of the Dutch import programme is now before the Four-PartyCommittee at Brussels, consisting of the Dutch Government, United, States and united Kingdom Economic advisers and S.H.A.E.F. As soon as this programme is approved, and if port capacity to meet it is made available by S.H.A.E.F., an
allocation of shipping to meet it will have to be considered. Much will dependon the date by which the liberation of Holland is completed. An early liberationwas not contemplated in the Shipping Survey.IV. Norway.A. Food,53. During the years of occupation the country has been receiving annuallyfrom Germany over half its bread grains (200,000 tons), all its sugar (50,000 tons)and one-half to two-thirds of its fats (20,000&apos; tons).54. There is already a desperate shortage of medical supplies and consumer goods.55. That part of the extreme Northern area of Norway which has beenliberated is small, but it is in a desperate situation owing to the barrenness of thecountry and the high degree of scorching carried out by the Germans as theyretreated. Over 2,000 tons of supplies have already been despatched for thepopulation of 23,000 people, and arrangements are being made for the handing over to the Norwegian Government of a further 4,000 tons for despatch to this area, which is in Russian occupation.56. The food position in non-liberated Norway is precarious and likely tobe aggravated as refugees arrive from the North. If the Germans cut off thesupplies that have been coming into Southern Norway from Denmark, the position will be very serious.57. A very small allotment of relief through the blockade has been proposedin W.P. (45) 28 (additional to the minimum of 500 tons a month, mainlyvegetables, at present sent from Sweden), viz., 500 tons of fats and milk a month;together with a cargo of lard which would admit of a distribution of 2,000 tons.B.- Economic Situation.58. The biggest and probably most important single raw material for whichNorway depends on outside sources, and which Germany has been supplyinghitherto, is undoubtedly coal and coke, annual requirements being about 3 million tons, though in the ordinary way a useful contribution used to come from Spitz-bergen of about one-tenth of this quantity. There are, however, a number of other important and quite bulky imports which would be needed very soon afterNorway&apos;s liberation if industrial economy is to be mantained at a satisfactorylevel, namely salt and salt cake (for fish-curing and paper pulp industries), ironand steel imports, including tinplate, agricultural machinery and tractors, andpossibly, though these are not bulky raw materials, wool, cotton and rubber.Mineral oils are presumably out of the question at the moment, though these are normally a fairly large import.C. Action in hand.59. &apos;(1) UN.R.R.A. will not play any part in procurement, shipment ordistribution of supplies in Norway.(2) No shipping allocation for Norway was provided in the recent discussions in Washington.(3) Certain immediate action has been taken, or is proposed, as described in paras. 55 and 57 above.   But it is on a very small scale.(4) A two months&apos; stockpile&apos;to meet Civil Affairs Requirements without thissix months&apos; programme has already been assembled in the United Kingdom.V. Denmark.60. Such information as is available suggests that Denmark, which is normally a surplus food-producing country, will not be faced with a really seriousfood problem on liberation, and that this is likely to be substantially true also ofthe economic field and of the position as regards raw materials.61. No tonnage provision has been made for dealing with the Danishposition.
VI. Italy.A. Food. .. .62. Liberated areas. The general standard of food, in occupied Italy is some way below that of the liberated territories of North-West Europe. On theother hand, Italy has never enjoyed so high a standard as that prevailing pre-warin more northerly countries. It would seem that conditions in Southern Italyand Sicily, where the bread ration was raised last summer to 300 grammes, is notdangerous. But S.A.C.M.E.U has recently furnished serious reports as to thedanger of unrest resulting from food shortages in Central Italy. As a result, hehas now been authorised to raise the ration in that area up to 300 grammes.This ration cannot, however, be extended throughout liberated Italy unless largerimports of wheat can be provided, but provision has been made in the ShippingSurvey for the necessary carrying capacity.In a country so largely agricultural, it is difficult to assess the actual caloriestandard prevailing. Official rations do not amount to more than 1,000-1,200calories and even with unrationed and black market supplies the standard isstill probably below 2,000 calories. The principal difficulties mitigating against any improvement are to be found in a shortage of shipping, a limited portcapacity, and the difficulties of internal transportation. The grain amassmentin 1944 has been more or less up to estimate, except in Sicily where, mainly for political reasons, results have been disappointing. It has unfortunately not yetbeen possible, owing to the shortage of supplies, to meet the large demands forblankets and clothing.63. Occupied &quot;Italy. The problem to be faced when Northern Italy isliberated is much more serious. It is anticipated that local supplies of grainwill be exhausted by the 1st March, and the difficulties of feeding an industrial population on grain are great if it has to be imported on the heels of an advancingarmy, and cannot be supplemented from the grainfields of the valley of the Po.B. Economic Situation.64. Southern Italy is, of course, mainly agricultural, and the economicsituation will not have to be faced in its full difficulty until the liberation of thegreat industrial areas of Northern Italy. Three problems will certainly then have to be considered : the first, the restoration of electric power to the extent that this has been destroyed; the second, transportation; the third, the importa-tion of raw materials to enable industries destroyed in the course of the war to carry on.65. In implementation of public statements by the Prime Minister and thePresident, agreement has now been reached with the Americans by which (a) the definition of &apos;&apos; disease and unrest &apos;&apos; is slightly expanded, and(b) a civil import programme of industrial first aid has been established the scope of which will be limited by the extent to which the proceeds of American troop pay and of Italian exports to the United States andthe United Kingdom are available to finance Italian purchases.66. A civil affairs programme of 1,355,000 tons (apart from coal) has beenarranged.67. U.N.R.R.A. are to do health welfare and displaced persons workinvolving the provision of supplies for this purpose additional to the militaryprogramme. A demand has been tabled by U.N.R.R.A. for 20,000 tons of shippinga month (61,400 tons a quarter) which should be ample for the programmeenvisaged by them.&apos; Under the interim agreement two cargoes are set aside forU.N.R.R.A. in Italy one in February and one in March.VII. Greece.Food and Economic Situation.68. It is still difficult to obtain information as to conditions in all partsof Greece. The situation even in those areas where it has been possible to intro-duce relief supplies is still very serious. That it is not worse is largely due tothe work done prior to liberation&apos;by the Swedish/Swiss Commission and theInternational Red Cross in the importation and distribution of foodstuffs. Onliberation it was found that the estimated requirements had to be considerably
increased if a 2,000 calorie standard was to be achieved. (This standard has nowbeen promised by General Scpbie.) The shortage of food is not confined to the cities (as in most liberated territories) but extends also to the country districts..The situation was further complicated by the general economic and politicaldisturbances and by the breakdown of the currency. These factors and thedifficulties of transportation made it impossible, for instance, to secure sufficient quantities of locally produced olive oil, which is a basic food item.69. Blankets and clothing, housing materials and many other preliminarynecessities are urgently required.C. Action in hand.70. The intention is that U.N.R.R.A. should as soon as possible and if practicable take over responsibility for procurement, shipping and distributionof supplies from the military authorities. Prior to the outbreak of the Civil War,it was working under the military authorities as a distributing agent and withoutresponsibility, so as to acquire experience and ensure continuity.71. It is still difficult to say how much limitation will be imposed by portintake and inland clearance. In the Shipping Survey, however, provision hasbeen made as follows :  First quarter  Tons(a) Civil affairs     ...      .........      287,000(6) U.N.R.R.A.............      105,000Owing to the disturbances in Greece the figures for the second quarter havenot been finally established, but provision has been made in the ShippingSurvey for Tons.(a) Civil affairs     ...........&apos;.&apos;     215,000(6) U.N.R.R.A.............      368,100VIII. Yugoslavia.A. Food.72. There is still very little information as to the general food situation in yugoslavia. There is reason to believe that considerable supplies of basic food-stuffs are available in Eastern Yugoslavia, but transport conditions make itimpossible to carry this at present to Southern and Western parts of the countryand the Dalmatian Coast. After considerable delay, due to the reluctance ofMarshal Tito to receive any observers to report on the distribution of relief supplies, agreement has now been reached. In the meantime, some supplieshave been sent to Split in anticipation of the signing of the agreement. Therewas a grave deficiency in autumn grain sowings in the surplus areas of the danube Plain. Unless the arrears can be made up in the spring, this will mean the continuance of imports on a heavy scale for the grain-deficient areas of thecountry.B. Economic Situation.73. Before the war Yugoslavia was a large exporter of food supplies.The bulk of her external trade was with neighbouring countries rather thanthrough her few small ports. There was a little textile industry which may require imports. But, by and large, Yugoslav needs are for the restoration of transportation and, in the meantime, for imports of food to prime the pump andredress the situation created by the breakdown of internal transportation.C. Action in hand.74. In the case of Yugoslavia port capacity, estimated not to exceed 90,000-100,000 tons a month, is the limiting factor. The programme, therefore(85,000 tons for the first quarter and 90,000 tons for the second quarter), whetherit is a military or an U.N.R.R.A. responsibility, has been kept within this figure.IX. -Albania.75. Very little information is available. The problem is of smalldimensions. It is unlikely to require greater provision than 35,000 tonsvin eachquarter.
X. Czechoslovakia.A. Food.76.   Apart from any special local problems that may arise in large centres of population, and excluding enemy scorching, no serious overall food reliefproblem seems likely to arise in the case of Czechoslovakia, but the possibility ofa considerable quantity of medical supplies being needed cannot be excluded.&apos; The difficulties are principally those of transport.B. ^Economic Situation. -&apos;77. Taking the Protectorate and Slovakia together, the imports most vitallyneeded to keep the country&apos;s economy going would be comparatively few, the mostprominent being textile raw materials (mainly cotton and wool) and possibly somenon-ferrous metals, leather and rubber.C. Action in hand.78. U.N.R.R.A. are ready to accept responsibility for relief and rehabilitation-tion supplies as soon as shipment (which the Soviet have, just agreed may takeplace through their ports) begins.XL-Poland.A.-Food.79. East of the Vistula a certain, though probably rather limited, amount of relief has already been given by the Russians, while industrial and agriculturalrestoration is reported to be already receiving some attention. [Cf. in thisconnection paragraph 128 (3) below.)80. . West of the Vistula a large area, including Warsaw, was evacuatedsome months ago and denuded of population and live-stock, most of which was moved into the frontier area after the harvest was collected. During the first six months of liberation the greatest need will be amongst Polish refugees in themost westerly towns and any remnants in the evacuated areas. The need for medical supplies, clothing and consumption goods is also likely to be very greatall over Poland.81. Unless further retreat is accomplished without scorching, the food position in six months&apos; time will be worsened, as, although Western Poland hasnormally an export surplus, the position will be complicated by the influx of refugees and by the lowered production which the dislocation will cause.82. Conditions in Poland are worse than- in any other part of Europe.700,000 people who endured the siege of Warsaw are subsisting at famine levelwithout adequate clothing and with far less than the minimum of supplies.83. A proposal is before the War Cabinet (W.P. (45) 28) that the figureof 200 tons a month of food and medicines, at present sent in from Switzerlandthrough the blockade, should be increased to 1,000 tons a month, to include small quantities of used clothing and medicines, but to consist mainly of mixed food-stuffs such as dried milk, tinned meat and fats.B. Economic Situation.84. Poland&apos;s chief industrial import requirements from the&quot;point of viewof importance and size would probably be cotton, iron ore and phosphaticfertilizers. Cotton would be essential for the textile industries of Lodz, not only from the point of view of labour, but for the supply of clothing to the population,while imports of high-grade iron ore are essential if the heavy industries ofSilesia are to be kept going. It is also of great importance to the United nations that the Polish coal industry should be kept in a position to produce to full capacity.85. The Russians already appear to have repaired destruction East of theVistula during the past five months to some extent, and a number of industrialplants are functioning again. There has been a good deal of evacuation,particularly of light industry, to the West of Poland and a great deal naturallydepends&quot; on the rapidity of the German retreat and the extent to which they are able to carry out scorching.
C. Action in hand.86. U.N.R.R.A. will have full responsibility for relief and rehabilitationsupplies. The Soviet have just agreed to shipments by U.N.R.R.A. being made through Soviet ports.87. A political difficulty may arise, however, in the event of the Lublin Polesinsisting on recognition as the Government of the country as a condition of receiving supplies produced by U.N.R.R.A.88. Provision for 40,000 tons of shipping for the first quarter, and of64,000 tons for the second quarter, of 1945 for Poland and Czechoslovakia was included in the Shipping Survey. A token shipping programme but no, allocation of shipping was actually made.89.   The proposals described in paragraph 83 also await the approval of theWar Cabinet.XII. Russia.90. No demand for relief has as yet been received from Russia in respect offood or raw materials for either her liberated or unoccupied areas. A certainamount of material, both food-stuffs and raw materials, is,, of course, received by russia under the terms of the current Fourth Protocol.91. For the moment, it seems unnecessary to consider the problem of reliefas affecting Russia.   (C/., however, paragraph 128 (3) below).XIII. The Enemy Countries.92.   In the interests of a complete picture, it will be convenient to add a brief note on the position of the enemy countries.93. Very broadly speaking, there is no indication that in Germany and austria there is at present a greater shortage of food than, e.g., in this country.The small area of Germany so far occupied by us revealed comfortable standards of living in rural areas, and in the towns a shortage which was probably dueto the special circumstances of invasion.94. On the other hand, consideration will have to be given, in the case ofall ex-enemy countries, once their occupation has been completed, to the provision,so far as the produce of the country cannot meet the demand, of the minimumsupplies of food-stuffs to keep these countries on a disease and unrest basis.95. The present proposals for the division of Germany into zones oi occupa-tion would result in the surplus food producing area being under Russian control,and it is doubtful whether under these circumstances any surplus from this source would be available for the deficiency areas under British and Americancontrol. Moreover, from the military point.of view, some provision must be madefor the temporary feeding of urban populations for the period immediately following the occupation of certain areas, and while they are cut off from their normal sources of supply. A proposal to this end has been approved(S.L.A.O. (45) 2) to provide a limited quantity of food-stuffs to S.H.A.E.F! forthis purpose and for the feeding of Displaced Persons, of whom there are verylarge numbers in Germany. Provision was accordingly made in the ShippingSurvey for 225,000 tons for this purpose. The scale in view is 1,500 calories as:against the figure of 2,000 calories which is being adopted in the case of liberated areas. Further supplies being primarily contingent on the end of the european war, and the consequent release of shipping, present no immediate problem.96. Hungary, Roumania and Bulgaria were normally surplus food-producing countries. The available evidence suggests that no special case exists in presentcircumstances for relief measures in respect of food for any of the three, though in the case of Roumania the economic disorganisation of the countryside and the consequent failure to sow on a scale to produce a full harvest must inevitablygive rise to difficulty in due course.General Conclusions.97. On the review of the situation in individual countries contained inparagraphs 36-96 above, our general conclusions are as follows : (1) There exists a degree of shortage of food supplies throughout liberatedEurope which varies from famine level in- certain urban areas in poland and overall in Greece to a somewhat slight overall shortage in
the case of France. This shortage is aggravated by the difficulties of distribution, and by the shortage of such raw materials as fertilizers,phosphates, &amp;c, and by the injury that has been done to means of transportation. The threat to the&apos;political stability of the countriesin question is a grave one.(2) In certain countries, and notably in North-West Europe, a grave shortageof raw materials threatens the stability of political and economic life.(3) On any long view of this problem the fact that it may be in our self-interest to consider the necessity for providing some assistance forex-enemy countries at a later stage cannot wisely be overlooked.(4) While we are working to a minimum standard of 2,000 calories, thatstandard has not yet reached over the liberated areas as a whole.When all occupied countries have been liberated, it can be reachedonly at the cost of an importation from outside Europe of 750,000 tonsof food a month, and the figure of 3,772,000 tons included in theShipping Survey is based on this assumption. Even so, it mustbe emphasised that a figure of 2,000 calories represents a floor andnot a ceiling. It is indeed the minimum figure accepted by themilitary authorities as adequate to ensure against disease and unrest.But it is well below the figures that have been discussed in the pastas adequate to provide a requisite nutritional standard.Causes of the Diffictdties that have arisen.98. It is unnecessary for us to particularise the causes of the present situa-tion. The waste and destruction of stocks and equipment resulting from active operations, the &quot; scorching&quot; policy adopted by the Axis powers, the diversion of labour to Germany from the countryside and from industrial production inthe occupied countries, the breakdown of internal transportation arrangements,have all contributed in a major degree.99. Secondly, the planning of the Allies before D-day was based on theassumption either that the campaign would be-one of attrition and slow retire-ment, and that arrangements could be worked out gradually in the light of experience gained, or that it would proceed so swiftly that the military period and the interval before the normal civil government was restored and materialcould be diverted from military production and requirements would be a shortone. In fact, neither of those expectations has been realised. The war is lastingmuch longer than was anticipated six months ago, and the problems of demand,supply, transportation, &amp;c.; which confront us in respect of liberated areas areonly one aspect of the consequence of this.In particular, it had, we understand, been anticipated that the bulk of thefighting would be in France and that Holland and Belgium would escape verylightly. In fact, France and Belgium have escaped relatively lightly but a burdenfar greater than anticipated has fallen on Holland.100. We have carefully considered to what extent any difficulties in theadministrative arrangements of the Allies have reduced deliveries to liberated areas below the level that could otherwise have been reached. Very broadly speaking, we doubt if any material responsibility can be attributed to difficultiesof this nature. There have no doubt here and there been, e.g., difficulties aboutsources of supply which may have involved minor delays; difficulties in planning and in procuring sufficiently far ahead; delays in making shipping available;slow turn-round and under-loading of ships and the use of ships for warehousingpurposes; and on occasion lately, there have been indications that the war production Board and the War Food Administration in Washington have been less swift in making certain supplies available than would otherwise have been thecase because of their uncertainty as to future policy.101. The joint effect of these factors may well have been to involve asubstantial waste of tonnage. The importance of any such waste must, however,be assessed in the light of the fact that port and inland clearance capacity couldnot in practice have handled larger tonnage than has presented itself. In thesecircumstances the total effect of any difficulties that there may have been is not of real significance. That does not, however, mean that, now that port and clear-ancer capacity are expanding, the closest attention should not be paid to avoiding any such difficulties so far as possible in the future.
102. The real problems are the difficulties of finding supply, of conveyingit by sea to the countries in which it is needed, and of discharging, clearingand removing it to the points of shortage when it has reached those countries.We review below the shipping and the supply aspects of this matter. We havealready emphasised the extreme importance of restoring something approachingnormal levels of transportation capacity in the liberated countries, and of theport intake and clearance problems as affecting it.Have the United States failed to Implement their Undertakings?103. We have considered whether and to what extent the difficulties ofthe situation result from any failure by the United States Government to implement their commitments. The question arises, as we understand, over theprovision of Civil Affairs supplies for the military period and a short explanationis therefore necessary on the way in which responsibility for the provision ofsuch supplies is allocated.104. Early in 1944, an over-all estimate (Plan A) of the supplies whichwould be required for the various liberated countries of Europe was preparedby the Combined Civil Affairs Committee in Washington. This estimate wasforwarded to the Combined Boards concerned, and recommendations were madeby them as to whether the United Kingdom or the United States should beresponsible for the provision of the necessary supplies. While the C.C.A.C.are not necessarily committed to accept the recommendations made by the Com-bined Boards, in fact they have done so in almost every case. Subsequent changesin the estimate or additions to it have been similarly treated.105. The only case in which it can be said that the United States definitelyfailed to provide the supplies for which they had accepted responsibility wasthat of the Balkans. In this case there had been reluctance on the Americanside to provide any supplies at all, although we had already assembled in Egyptour share of the agreed stockpile for this purpose. When the liberation of Greececommenced the Americans had in fact provided nothing towards their commit-ment to supply the necessary meat, fats, milk and pulses to a total of about40,000 tons, and we were forced to make good the deficiency out of army stocks.The United States have, however, since recognised their responsibility in full,have undertaken to replace the goods provided from British army stocks, andare now providing satisfactorily their share of current supplies.108. On the other band, we are faced with a serious deficiency in the pro-vision of meat, clothing and blankets. While the quantities of these commoditiesallocated to the United Kingdom is small, the United States accepted responsi-bility for far larger quantities, which they now state they are unable to provide,at least within any reasonable period. The shortage of meat has only recentlydeveloped and is no doubt due in part at least to the needs of troops overseas andthe limitation on canning facilities. In the case of clothing and blankets, ithas always been clear that their provision in such quantities would constitute a serious problem and that special production capacity would have to be set aside in the United States. This has not been done, and it is doubtful whetherit could be done without the introduction of some restrictions on the provisionof clothing and blankets for the use of the civilian population in the UnitedStates. It is, however, only fair to point out that we also are having difficultyin meeting our commitments for clothing.107. Attention should also be drawn to the fact that the United StatesWar Department always tend to regard the United Kingdom as the primarysource of&apos; relief supplies for Europe, and are willing to accept responsibilityby the United States only when they are satisfied that the United Kingdom hasmade its maximum contribution. We have always resisted this attitude andinsisted on the utilisation of the Combined Boards procedure. Our efforts inthis direction have so far been successful, but it is fair to record that the attitudeof the United States War Department has on occasion resulted in some delay inthe provision of supplies for the field.Conclusion.108. We conclude that, while within a limited area there has been failure on the part of the United States to discharge its commitments, there has of latebeen a marked improvement, and that on a broad view no case has been made out for representations at a high, level in this regard.
Relief for Liberated Areas in Terms of Availability of (a) Shipping (b) Supply.109.   On the assumption that has been established, both on politicaland humanitarian grounds, for the most generous treatment of the liberated areas consistent with the other claims on the United Nations, the next question for examination is the availability of the necessary supplies and the practicability of conveying them, when available, to their destination.110. We examine this matter under two headings (1) shipping and(2) supply.Shipping.111. An overall review of cargo shipping has&apos; recently been conducted in washington by the Combined Military Transportation Committee and the combined Shipping Adjustment Board. The results of that review are nowunder examination by the Ministry of War Transport and the Chiefs of Staff,and we understand that the Minister of War Transport may be laying a paperregarding it before the ad hoc Ministerial Committee. Briefly, the effect of the survey is to show a deficiency of sailings amounting to 689 for the first sixmonths of 1945. The effect of such a deficiency on the problem of the liberated areas is clear.   The position is examined below.112. The total requirements for European liberated areas included inthe Shipping Survey are 10,922,000 tons for the first six months of 1945. this figure, however, includes : (a) 3,076,000 tons of coal, which forms part of the military shipping pro-gramme and is almost entirely required for operational purposes.Local industrial needs have to be met in almost all cases from localproduction. This figure has already been severely cut on supply and port capacity grounds and is not capable of further reduction.(b) 3,772,000  tons of  the  civil  affairs  requirements  of  S.C.A.F.  andS.A.C.M.E.D. This is also included in the military shipping pro-programme and any reduction in it would almost certainlyTead to thesupplies so excluded being transferred to the civil import pro-grammes.113. This leaves 4,074,000 tons towards the French and Belgian Govern-ment programmes and the U.N.B.R.A. programmes for Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia,Albania, Poland and Czechoslovakia. These figures are far below pre-warimports, and are below what was coming in under German occupation. Theyhave already been substantially restricted by lack of port and inland clearancecapacity; and they are represented by the claimants as urgent and essentialminima, screened to the highest priority requirements, and as not beingsusceptible to further reduction without serious risks. Indeed, they cannot safely be maintained over a long period at the low levels shown by these figures for thefirst six months.114. Delivery of supplies to liberated areas is not limited by any one factorsuch as shipping, but depends on a number.of successive bottlenecks. Lack of capacity to discharge ships and to clear their cargoes to points of consumption,inter-governmental negotiations where one country depends on the ports or inland transport of another, shortages of supply and failure to begin procurement intime may all reduce the flow of supply.115. If a comparison is made between the estimate of liberated area require-ments. (excluding the civil affairs and coal programmes) before allowance had beenmade for the non-shipping bottlenecks referred to in the previous paragraph(8 - 2 million tons) and the same requirements after that allowance has been made(4 -1 million tons), it will be seen that a reduction in the gross programmes has beenmade of about 4 million tons, which is approximately the same figure as the netrequirements now included in the Survey.116. The general question whether the incidence of the shipping deficiencyshould be evenly spread, or whether it should fall wholly or mainly on certainprogrammes awaits high level decision. From the liberated areas standpoint an even cut on all programmes is the most favourable practical assumption. At the opposite extreme is the view of the United States Army and Navy that militaryprogrammes (amounting to 82 per cent, of American shipping commitments)
should be met in full, and that civil programmes (amounting to 18 per cent, of they/hole) should bear the full brunt of the deficiency. This would involve a cut ofabout 50 per cent, in United States allocations to all civil programmes.  -117, Any cuts made must, as we see it, fall upon the French and BelgianNational Import Programmes and on- the U.N.R.R.A. programmes for Italy,Greece, Yugoslavia, Albania, Poland and Czechoslovakia.118. Allocations so far provided for against these programmes for the first quarter, including the interim North Atlantic allocations agreed by Mr. Hopkinsand Mr. Law at Washington, are even less than one-quarter of the six months&apos;&apos;requirements. It will, therefore, be all the more necessary that these programmes should be met in the second quarter as far as shipping allows.119. On a requirements criterion alone there is ho justification for any cut.Since, however, the recommendation of the Combined Military TransportationCommittee and C.S.A.B. is to the effect that the overall shipping deficit should be absorbed on as broad a basis as possible, it will probably be necessary for thesecountries to accept some further cut on shipping allocations for these programmes.It is not, at this time, possible to give a definite indication as to which countries should bear the cut. Our knowledge of port capacity, of inland clearance, andthe rate of absorption of supplies in such countries is not yet sufficient. The vitalpoint is that the flow of supplies should begin immediately and steadily increase.This can only be done if there are regular agreed shipping programmes.120. We append a table (Appendix) setting out the total requirements,the probable shipping allocated against them in the first quarter, and the resultingdeficit.121. The rate of increase can, of course, be lessened if this is the only wayto achieve the cuts desired. In fact, however, it is probably safe to assume that,for the reasons already given and because in some cases supplies will not beavailable, the total shipping required for these areas will be less in the aggregatethan estimated.122. It should, however, be borne in mind that the shipping requirementsOf these areas will continue to increase throughout 1945 and that larger alloca-tions of shipping will be necessary in the second half of 1945 than in the first half. Further, that no provision has been made in the present shipping survey for National Import Programmes, or, with the exception of May and June in thecase of Holland, for the Civil Affairs programmes, of Holland, Norway orDenmark; and that it is now almost certain that some shipments may be neededat any rate for Holland and Norway.Summary and Recommendations.123. Our conclusions and recommendations in respect of the shipping-problem as affecting supplies for liberated areas are as follows: (i) Owing to bottlenecks other than shipping, deliveries of overseas imports to liberated areas are likely to be limited to less than 11 million longtons during the first half of 1945 assuming continuance of the german war. This figure could not on present prospects be exceeded even ifunlimited shipping were available,(ii) A decision to deliver nearly 11 million tons to liberated areas would,we are advised, involve cuts on all military and civil long-haulprogrammes, probably averaging more than 12 per cent., in view ofthe already known snipping deficiency and of the expected upwardrevision of the loss rate.(iii) On a requirements criterion alone we are satisfied, for the reasons givenin this review, that there is no justification for any cut in liberatedarea programmes. The shipping deficit- revealed by the Shipping-Survey may, however, make it necessary for these countries to accept some further cut on shipping allocations.(iv) We are only concerned in this Report with the effect on the provisionof supplies to liberated areas of any cut that may be made. The effect,so far as&apos;we can judge, of the application to supplies for liberated areas of any general cut of 12 per cent, on civil import programmes would be a reduction in the amounts to be provided for the liberated- areas of some 500,000 tons. While this is a material proportion of the[29087] . D
total figure for which they hope of 4 million tons, we cannot feel thatits effect could be so material as to justify the entire exemption of the liberated areas if Ministers are satisfied that a case.for applying anycommon cut to them exists.The Problem of Supply (Food and Raw Materials).124. We now proceed to consider to what extent, within the limitations imposed by shipping availability, supplies, whether of food or raw materials(beyond Civil Affairs Standard), can be made available for the liberated areas,and the effect of making them available on the position of the United Kingdom.A. Food.125. As regards food, the essential shortages are in respect of cereals, fatsand animal products. The problem of supply is one of special difficulty in thecase of fats and animal products. (It is relevant that the French and BelgianColonies, if transport was available, could do much to meet the essential needsof the Mother Countries.) While generally one for the United States ratherthan for the United Kingdom, it cannot be said to be entirely a matter forthe United States. Discussions as regards allocation are at the moment pro-ceeding. These have not yet been finalised. But we understand that provision isbeing made in the course of them for the claims under the head of food whichhave already been put forward by, or in respect of, liberated areas, and that sofar as oan be seen supplies sufficient to fill all shipping that can be providedwr-ill be available, though in some cases substitutes may have to be supplied forsome of the items demanded.126. While this may, in some cases, be at the expense of the maintenanceat their present level of certain United Kingdom stocks, we understand that sufficient food to fill the liberated areas programme, without materiallyencroaching on or reducing these stocks, may be regarded as in sight. Of the750,000&quot; tons a month of foodstuffs which, as stated in paragraph 97 (4) above,will have to be imported from overseas in order to supply all liberated areas atthe 2,000 calorie standard, we understand, however, that 450,000 tons may have tobe in wheat, and only the balance in concentrated foods.B. Raw Materials.127. As regards raw materials the most important heads of demand fromthe liberated areas are agricultural (including fertilisers, phosphates,pyrites, &amp;c.); textiles; and metals. Very broadly speaking, these are in easysupply, with the possible exception of certain metals. There are, in addition,certain specialised items, such as rubber, hides and jute, which are in short supply, and which are allocated subject only to the approval of the CombinedRaw Materials Board, but these are relatively of less significance. The extentto which, for reasons of supply, the United Kingdom can assist over rawmaterials is strictly limited. But we are advised that without unduly eating intoUnited Kingdom stockpiles or United Kingdom receipts from overseas, it shouldbe possible to meet the demands of the liberated areas within the limits of avail-able shipping.Miscellaneous Suggestions.128. We have endeavoured in this report to deal with the problem beforeus in its broad aspects. Certain specific suggestions have, however, been madeto us on points of detail which we set out below and which we commend for theconsideration of Ministers.129.   These are as follows  Transportation.(1) We have referred in paragraphs 30-35 above to the vital importance of restoring normal levels of inland transportation. A great contributioncould be made to this if the United States would consider re-planningtheir truck production. It is clear that shortage of trucks will inthe coming months be an issue of critical importance in there-establishment of European economy. No progress on this pointcan, however, be hoped for save in reference to an approach at thehighest level. . -
(2) It has been suggested that given the critical nature of the transportsituation, and the probability that, even if we cannot for operational reasons spare serviceable trucks, the liberated areas could turn toadvantage many vehicles which fall below the minimum standard of potential serviceability regarded by us as justifying their repair, weshould be prepared to make vehicles falling below that level availablefree of charge to liberated areas, leaving it to those areas to make their own repair arrangements. We understand that existing financial instructions may preclude such an arrangement. -If this is correct, and on the assumption that we should not ourselves, in fact,make further use of the damaged bodies in question, we suggest thatthe possibility of making them over, and of modifying the financialinstructions in question, merits examination.(3) In view of the acute shortage of food-stuffs in Western Europe it has beensuggested that an approach might be made on the highest level to premier Stalin with a view to his agreeing to the diversion from theEast to the West of some proportion of the surplus food production to. be anticipated in certain Eastern areas (e.g., the Danubian basin and eastern Germany). We think this suggestion merits further examina-tion. But we recognise that the difficulties of transport across europe in present conditions, the claims of Eastern areas, such as liberatedPoland, and the claims of the liberated areas of Russia herself, arelikely to militate against its acceptance.(4) Much might be done to save shipping and to secure increased deliveries to liberated areas if artificial distinctions between military and civilshipments could be kept to a minimum, as has always been the case, forexample, in the Middle East. American Army ships capable of carry-ing 8,000 long tons of cargo (or, say, 6,000 tons where vehicles are carried) are being sent to Europe in large numbers carrying only some4,500 tons each. These economies can only be achieved as the necessaryorganisa ^ ion is developed, and as handling conditions improve. Itshould then be possible for much shipping to be saved by adoptingMiddle East methods of spreading military and civil cargo in the sameships. We feel that the possibility of arranging for this should beconsidered.General Conclusions.130.   Our conclusions may be summarised as follows : (1) A serious shortage of food and of raw materials exists in respect ofcertain areas of certain countries, and overall in others liberated or tobe liberated. The shortage is of critical importance in certain casesbut is significant in all. It is likely in many cases to be worse before it is better.(2) It is essential for political and highly important for operational as wellas for humanitarian reasons to take all practicable steps to remedy theshortage.(3) So far as food is concerned, we consider it possible to meet the agreedrequirements, and that subject to the shipping point taken below,without materially affecting the position of this country.(4) That is also substantially the case as regards raw materials.(5) But shipping, taken with port clearance, is a substantial limitation. TheShipping Survey recently completed in Washington shows a, shortageof 689 sailings over the first six months of this year. Quite apartfrom the shortage of shipping, the reduction necessitated by otherbottle-necks in supply programmes for the liberated areas is substantial.(6) A decision of policy is called for as to how to meet the shortage ofsailings referred to in paragraph (5). We understand that theMinister of War Transport will be making certain proposals to theCommittee. The present indications are that an over-all cut of12 per cent, of all civil and military long haul (i.e., excluding cross-Channel, internal Mediterranean, and coasting) sailings will berequired.
(7) So far as the liberated areas are concerned, we do not feel that thereis a sufficient case for excepting programmes for them from theoperation of such a cut. Its application on a 12 per cent, basis wouldinvolve a reduction of some 500,000 tons.(8) The administrative machine may on occasion have been confronted with difficulties which were not always rapidly overcome. But we do notconsider that any material injury has resulted. Nor, though there havebeen certain failures on the part of the United States to implement their undertakings, do we regard these as of such a character as to call for representations, more especially as there has been of late a very marked improvement. -    &apos;-.(9) We draw attention in paragraph 128 to certain suggestions put to uswhich we think merit consideration by the Ministerial Committee.(Signed) J.
