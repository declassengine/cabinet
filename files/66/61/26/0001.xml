S E G R E TW.P.(45)7150TH JANUARY , 1945.WAR CABINETRELIEF FOR THE CHANNEL ISLANDSMemorandum by the Home  SecretaryFollowing the first visit of the Red Cross ship &quot;Vega&quot; tothe Channel Islands a preliminary.report including recommendations for future cargoes has been received from the International red cross Delegates who accompanied the ship.    The Delegates were granted all facilities for accomplishing their task of supervision,and the distribution of relief supplies was carried out in asatisfactory manner.Information had been received through the International red cross Committee at the beginning of January - shortly after theshipfs arrival in the Islands, - that the International Red CrossDelegate, after consultation with the Bailiffs of Jersey andGuernsey, had recommended the urgent despatch of flour, yeast,fuel, leather for shoe repairs, clothing and footwear and a fewother miscellaneous supplies.    Steps have been taken, with thePrime Minister&apos;s concurrence, to arrange that flour and yeastwill be sent to the Islands as soon as possible on one of the .shirjs future journeys from Lisbon^The remaining supplies urgently necessary are:-(l)  5,000 tons of gas coal and 200 tons of coke monthly;(s) a single consignment of footwear and clothing, especially for agricultural workers;(5)  60,000 candles, boxes of matches and flints for lighters;(4)  1,400 litres of petrol for hospital ambulances and.doctors&apos;  cars.The approval of the War Cabinet given on the 7th november last (f,M.(44) 147th Conclusions Minute 2)  to the sending of relief supplies did not cover items of this nature.    I had intended to await a more detailed&apos;report from the International Red cross committee at Geneva before submitting further proposals to the WarCabinet,    This expected report has not yet been received, despiteseveral reminders, but I have now seen a copy of the &quot;JerseyEvening Post&quot; dated the 2nd January, and statements have beenmade by two men who escaped from Guernsey on 25th January, thatthere is an urgent need of fuel and clothing; and I do not feel justified in deferring the matter further.    If gas coal is sent,it may not be possible to confine the use of gas to civilians butthe absence of fuel for cooking and heating is so serious from(    the health point of view that any small advantage accruing to the-   enemy will be more than offset by the advantage to the civilianswho are in a poor state to subsist on uncooked food.    Clothing,footwear and the other supplies mentioned would be distributed to civilians.1 iCOPY NO.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)

I ask for authority to proceed immediately with arrangements for sending to the Islands the suppliesmentioned above.H.M.Home Office,Whitehall, S.W.I.
