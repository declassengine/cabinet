THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT /- ---------- i . ^       ^ v,;^     I   jPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1045. / ^ secret. Copy Mo.     36W.P. (15) 54.24th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.INDIA :-THE VICEROY&apos;S INTERVIEW WITH Mr.. DESAI.Report by the Lord President of the Council, Chairman of the india committee.ON the 18th January we drew up a report for the War Cabinet about Mr. Desai&apos;s approach to the Viceroy (W.P. (45) 37). Attached to our report wasa draft telegram, setting out a number of points on which we felt that furtherinformation was required. We added that the exploration of these points shouldbe carried out non-committally by the Viceroy&apos;s Private Secretary, and not by theViceroy himself. At our request a telegram was sent to the Viceroy by theSecretary of State for India on the 16th January, asking the Viceroy not toarrange a personal interview with Desai until he heard further.2. On the 18th January, however, before our report could be consideredby the War Cabinet, a telegram was received from the Viceroy reporting thathe had already arranged an interview, with Desai on the *20th January. we accordingly met again and settled the terms of a telegram to the Viceroy, of whichthe operative paragraphs were as follows  - (1) &quot; The War Cabinet would have greatly preferred that direct contact between you and Desai should have been avoided at this moment. they recognise, however, that at this stage it. may be impossible for you to put Desai off. If so they will raise no objection to your seeing him.(2) &quot;If an interview between Desai and yourself is now inevitable, the WarCabinet feel sure that you will recognise how necessary it is that the interview should not in any way commit either the Government oryourself; and that no encouragement will be given to any expectation that Desai&apos;s proposals, either with or without modification, will prove acceptable.&apos;&apos;3. A telegram has now been received from the Viceroy reporting the upshotof his interview with Desai on the 20th January. (See Telegram No. 157-rSattached as Annex I.) It will be seen that in the concluding paragraph theViceroy suggests that &quot; it would obviously be the next step &quot; for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to authorise him to talk with Jinnah and that if Jinnah&apos;s attitude is favourable, he should perhaps see Jinnah and Desai together.4. The India Committee do not recommend the adoption of this course,which might well be interpreted as showing that the Viceroy considered Desaito have greater authority behind his proposals than is at present established, andregarded them as affording a satisfactory basis on which discussions with congress and the Moslem League might proceed. In fact, however, there is nothing toshow that Desai&apos;s proposals satisfy the conditions which we regard as essential.Nor is there any assurance that his proposals have secured substantial support from Congress or the Moslem League.5. We recommend to the War Cabinet that the draft telegrams (attached as Annexes II and III) should be despatched to the Viceroy. These telegramsembody the points on which, in our view, further information is required, andare intended to draw from the Viceroy an assurance that he is in agreement withthe War Cabinet as to the points on which we must be satisfied before he has anymore interviews and before Desai&apos;s scheme can be seriously entertained.[29105]
6. We also suggest that the Viceroy should be informed that, while wewould see no objection to his Private Secretary making certain enquiries ofLiaqat Ali Khan, he (the Viceroy) should not see Jinnah for the present, andthat discussions on this matter should be allowed to develop slowly, and that no new move should be made until the War Cabinet has been able to consider theinformation asked for.7. We attach great importance to this cautious approach since, unless thismatter is handled with great care, we may well find that the Viceroy hasembarked on a negotiation without due consideration of the conclusion to whichthis course of action is likely to lead, and from which there may be no escapewithout grave embarrassment and perhaps damage to the war effort, and withoutforcing His Majesty&apos;s Government into a position which would bring about acomplete constitutional change in Indian Government.C. E. A.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,24  h January, 1945.ANNEX I.Copy of a telegram dated 20th January, 1945, from the Viceroy to theSecretary of State for India.157-S.Superintendent Series. Your telegram 1509, 18th January. I had45 minutes with Desai on 20th morning. I said suggestions he had made tomy Private Secretary were sufficiently interesting for me to wish to hear them at first hand and elucidate certain points. I then asked him why he preferredhis plan to the alternatives put forward by others, e.cj., unofficial committee like that of.&apos;Sapru, or -official, conference convened by Viceroy. He replied thatattitude of Moslem League toward the Rajagopalaehari formula as shownduring Gandhi-Jinnah talks made it clear that the committee or conference could not settle communal issue. He therefore thought best solution was to getthe main parties working together in the administration, and if this could beachieved he felt that communal and constitutional settlement might be easier.2. I asked him about attitude of Gandhi and Jinnah. He said that Gandhiwould approve and tell Working Committee he had done so. He also seemedquite sure of Jinnah, though he had not seen him, and relied on reports fromLiaqat Ali Khan. He denies that proportion of 40 per cent. Congress, 40 percent. Moslems and 20 per cent, others had been agreed, but said he would acceptequality between Hindus and Moslems if this proved essential to success, though he felt Hindus were entitled to a majority.3. I said a provisional Government of which Congress members took orders from Gandhi or Working Committee and League members from Jinnah and moslem League (1 would be) quite unworkable. He agreed and said he nevercontemplated outside control of the Centre. But he was less definite about theProvinces and said he could not answer for them in the same way.4. I asked what guarantee there would be that provisional Governmentwould support the war effort and maintain law and order. He said that main,guarantee would be the judicious selection of members. Selection would be madeby party members of the Legislature but persons selected would not necessarily be members of the Legislature. He agreed that final choice would have to rest with the Governor-General and His Majesty&apos;s Government.5. I asked him how he thought the portfolio would be allotted. He said hehad not considered this but the Governor-General would have the final wordafter considering recommendations of the party leaders. I pointed out special difficulty of finding Finance and Home Members. He said he thought this notinsuperable.6. He was against any immediate attempt by Provisional Government topromote long-term solution. In his opinion this would have to wait until the atmosphere seemed favourable.7. He was against general election at the Centre or in the Provinces duringthe war. He said they would, not discount change of composition of Legislaturesand were for obvious reasons undesirable.
AO8. I pointed out that it would be most unfortunate if any fresh move resultedin a setback and that considerable caution in considering and (? initiating a move was necessary. He replied that continuation of present situation was more likely than not to lead to an upheaval.9. I concluded by saying that I would take what he had said into considera-tion but that patience in solution of this difficult problem was necessary and finaldecision on most appropriate line to take rested with His Majesty&apos;s Government.10. Desai&apos;s attitude was friendly and frank and he answered my questionswithout hesitation or equivocation. But how far he has really got substantialbacking for his proposals or what Moslem League attitude really is, I do not knowand cannot find out unless His Majesty&apos;s Government authorise me to talk toJinnah which would obviously be next step and if his attitude was favourable(? perhaps) to see them both together.ANNEX II.Draft Telegram from the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy.1. We are grateful for the account of your interview with Desai in your157-S of the 20th January.2. The version of his proposals which Desai gave to you seems in some respects less positive and satisfactory than that which he gave to your private secretary.   In particular we note &apos;(i) that he denies that the proportions inside the new Council are agreed.(ii) that there is no guarantee of full support from Congress or League forthe war effort.Full and formal guarantees of a binding character would clearly be necessary.3. On receipt of your telegram No. 109-S the War Cabinet had drawn up alist of points arising out of Desai&apos;s proposals on which they are anxious forfurther information. Some of these were elucidated by your questions to Desai,but the replies to- others are as yet vague. Cabinet have embodied in my imme-diately following telegram a list of points which they feel sure you will agreemust be answered satisfactorily. The Scheme, in their view, needs most carefultesting. It involves conceding interim government, which in Cripps&apos; offer was conditional on permanent constitutional settlement, without any commitment asregards long-term problem.4. It would be a great help to the War Cabinet if you would let them havea statement showing to what extent, as result of the discussions which have takenplace so far, you yourself are satisfied that the points set out in the ensuingtelegram are met by Desai&apos;s scheme.5. The War Cabinet feel that, until they have an opportunity of studying the statement now asked for, and have a clearer idea of what is really involved inDesai&apos;s proposals, and whether they merit serious consideration, care should betaken to avoid any impression that we are in a hurry to take action in regard tothis approach.6. This indicates a cautious attitude, and we do not think it would be wisethat you should invite Jinnah to come and see you at this stage. We suggestthat it would be preferable for your Private Secretary, after a short interval, totake soundings of Liaqiat Ali Khan in order to ascertain, without in any waycommitting you or His Majesty&apos;s Government, how far Desai&apos;s account of theattitude of the Moslem League in this matter can be relied upon. We note from paragraph 7 of your I. and B. Dept. telegram No. 705, of the 23rd January,that Liaqat has said publicly that his talks with Desai had no political significance. In the meantime, it would probably also be better that you shouldnot make further personal contact with Desai until you have heard from us again.
ANNEX III.Draft Telegram from the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy.My immediately preceding telegram.The following are the main points on which the War Cabinet would be glad of further information : (a) Your telegram makes it clear that you agree with us that support forthe war effort is a condition precedent to participation in the Government by representatives of the political parties. How do we stand as regards this ?Paragraph 4 of your 157-S does not, even in the light of its last sentence,appear to guarantee it. Full and binding assurances on this matter in respect of congress and the Moslem League would, of course, be essential.(b) We cannot reconcile paragraphs 3 (b) with 3 (d) of your 109-S, and position is still left obscure by your 157-S. If it is the intention that theGovernor-General should accept a list submitted to him by political parties andwould have no effective freedom of choice, as if he were the Governor-General ofa Dominion, that would be wholly inconsistent with present constitutional position.Distinction is, of course, vital. If this were the intention, we feel that the personal authority behind the Governor-General&apos;s reserve powers would be verymuch weakened at the outset, and that we should in effect be committed to theprinciple of a Parliamentary Executive at the Centre. It is possible withoutaltering the letter of&apos;the present constitution to change entirely its nature bythe acceptance of conventions. We feel that in dealing with the legal-mindedIndian, this point is very important.(c) With reference to paragraph 3 of your 157-S, we are not clear whetherDesai contemplates that Congress and Moslem League members of ExecutiveCouncil would individually be subject to control by their party organisations.(The same problem arises in connection with the provinces.) Whether this willbe so in fact depends rather on the spirit in which entry into the Government ismade than on a specific pledge.(d) We do not feel satisfied that Desai is in a position to commit Congressor Jinnah, or how far Gandhi&apos;s personal assent or acquiescence carries with itthe support of Congress or only commits himself. The proposal that detenusshould be released only after the new Government is in office would, failingbinding assurances in respect of Congress, leave it open to them, to start agitationfor further concessions and provoke a break. If the scheme is to work, in theCentre or in the Provinces, full and official Congress Party acceptance and support to cover both would have to be guaranteed for it. How would you propose tosecure this ?(e) There is no suggestion that the Quit India Resolution would be withdrawn.(/) We are not clear as to precise meaning of statement in paragraph 3 (e)of your telegram (109-S) that Jinnah would agree to a Government of the kind proposed &quot; without prejudice to Pakistan.&quot;(g) How would the 20 per cent, minority seats in the Council be selected andcomposed? Would they include non-Congress Hindus and non-Muslem LeagueMuslems ? If so, the figure would hardly seem sufficient. Will provision be madeto represent non-official Europeans in the 20 per cent. ?(h) Would Indian officials be eligible for appointment to the Council?
