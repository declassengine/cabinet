THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.Copy No.WAR CABINET.THE FOOD SITUATION IN BELGIUM AND THE NETHERLANDS.Memorandum by the Minister of Eood.MY colleagues may like to see a report just made to me by Sir Jack Drummond(who has been this Ministry&apos;s Scientific Adviser throughout the war, and who has just returned, from a Mission of Investigation of nutritional conditions in belgium and liberated Holland).2. The parts of his report dealing with occupied Holland were obtainedfrom persons who had recently got through the German lines and from Intelligencesources.J. J. Ll.Ministry of Food, W. 1,30th January, 1945.Report by Sir Jack Drummond.You have asked me to let you have a very short note summarising my observa-tions on food conditions in Belgium and the Netherlands.Belgium.2. So far as I could judge, the town populations appear to be in better shapethan when I was there early in October. They then looked pinched and underfed,but there is now definite improvement in their appearance. The explanation is, Ithink, that at that time liberation had cut off black-market supplies and people were living almost entirely on their rather meagre rations. They had, therefore,lost some weight. The reorganisation of the currency also dealt the black marketa heavy blow. Since then, however, there appears to have been a recovery, andat the present time black-market transactions seem to be nearly as extensive asthey undoubtedly were before liberation. In other words, a fairly large proportionof the people in the bigger towns are probably getting an additional 10 to 25 percent, over and above their rationed foods.3. There is, however, one important difference between the present conditions and those that existed before liberation. Then, there was comparatively littleunemployment, and, by and large, most people not only took up their rations, but could afford to buy additional food from one source or another. The situationis now very much less favourable. The acute shortage of coal and the scarcity of any kind of raw materials are causing a very serious rise in unemployment figures. This means that the poorer families are no longer able to purchase food in the black market. Moreover, there is good evidence that many of them,particularly those having large families, can no longer afford to buy the rationsand there is a growing market for meat and fat coupons which are purchased by the more well-to-do.4. It is clear, therefore, that the economic crisis that is rapidly approachingwill be associated with a serious deterioration in the food situation as it affects the poorer people even if the official ration scale is maintained or improved.[29145]SECRET.W.P.

Netherlands.(a) Liberated A reas.5. The food situation in the towns is considerably improved since November .and early December when disturbing reports of under-nourishment were being received. At that time the rations were at a semi-starvation level, and the position was undoubtedly grave. Excellent co-operation between the S.H.A.E.F. Nether-lands Mission, 21st Army Group and the food officials of the Netherlands military administration and Government has been responsible for a steady improvementin the quantity of supplies and in their distribution. A very fine job of work has been done. . Each week, since the middle of December, there has been animprovement, even if only a slight one, in the rations and the distribution machine,and the morale of the town-populations has risen accordingly. It is now good.The rations are still small, and there is little or no food coming from illegal sources,but the people are taking their present hardships in a very philosophical frame of mind. They are most grateful for what has been done during the past twomonths. They are not grumbling, but they are naturally anxious for the return of a scale of rations that would enable them to get back to a normal state andto get to work again. Their diet is at present spartan in every sense of the word,and there is real need for a little more meat and fat.6. The food authorities are handling the available supplies in an admirablemanner. Babies are being excellently looked after, and children are being takencare of as well as supplies permit. It is hoped shortly to reintroduce the specialfood allowances for pregnant women and nursing mothers, and for heavy workers.The outlook is reasonably encouraging, as the Netherlands Food Commissionerhas a well-thought-out plan for increasing gradually the calorie value of the ration to the first target of 2,000 calories per head, but at the same time he isprudently trying to build up small reserves along the pipe-line of distribution.&apos;7. As far as I could judge, health is reasonably good in this area. Thereis no abnormal incidence of disorders of malnutrition. The only widespreadabnormality of people is underweight. This will be remedied as soon as the rations rise to a better level.(b) Occupied Netherlands.8. There do not appear to be any difficulties about food supplies in theNorth-Eastern Provinces, which is largely agricultural, and where there are fewtowns of any size.9. The position in the West and North-West is critical. Reliable reports indicate that the populations of the large towns, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, theHague, Dordrecht, &amp;c, are now reduced to a starvation level. Recent arrivalswho have penetrated the enemy lines speak of these people getting only 4 oz. of bread a day, and about 2 pints of a thin soup made from sugar beets and small quantities of vegetables. If these reports are true, the people are getting only about 500 to 800 calories a day, which is sheer starvation.10. Little is known of the steps the Germans may be taking to deal withthe embarrassing problem, but there are reports that a certain amount of foodis being brought in by night by boats from the East, and that the returningtransport is evacuating children, presumably to the North-Eastern Provinceswhere food is available. We are, however, undoubtedly faced by a position inwhich it is quite impossible for the Germans to bring in sufficient food to feedthese town populations reasonably well even if they wish to do it, and we are,therefore, likely to find, when this area is. liberated, an extremely serious situation. There is now no heating; a rather grave outbreak of typhoid hasstruck Amsterdam, and there is a diphtheria epidemic in Rotterdam. If theposition of these people is not alleviated materially and soon, many thousandswill die, directly or indirectly, of starvation. People cannot survive at calorielevels such as those that are believed to be current in these towns for more than two or three months.J. C. DRUMMOND.14th January, 1945.
