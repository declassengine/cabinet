THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.  &apos; .Copy No.WAR CABINET.PRODUCTION  OF THE  PARLIAMENTARY  REGISTER.Joint Memorandum  by the Chancellor of  the Exchequer, the HomeSecretary, and the. Secretary of State for Scotland.WE consider it necessary to draw the attention of the Cabinet to theposition regarding facilities for the production of the Parliamentary Registerwhich the Cabinet have decided shall be published on the 7th May(W.M. (44) 148 Cons. 4) and which will be required by the Representation of thePeople Bill, now before Parliament, to be published on that date.2.   Forms of tender &quot;for contracts for the of this Register have been circulated to Electoral Registration Officers by the Stationery Office. The formof contract enables a printer to state (a) the number of names which he can coverwith his existing staff, (p) the number which could be covered with additional staff, and (c) the amount of extra staff required. The contract provides for thepublication of electors lists by the 15th March, and the consequent republicationin the form of a Register on the 7th May of those lists as amended by claims and objections.3. In the knowledge of the difficulties at present existing in the printingtrade, the Ministry of Labour, in consultation with the Stationery Office, theBritish Federation of Master Printers and the Printing and Kindred TradesFederation, and the corresponding Scottish bodies, instituted a procedure, agreed at a meeting on the 11th December, which it was hoped would facilitate thetemporary release of printing operatives for this work. This scheme was basedon the submission by both sides of the printing industry of the names of printingoperatives who would be willing to return to printing work in the areas wherethey worked prior to being engaged on war work; and the Ministry of Labourundertook to use every endeavour to secure the release of such persons from theirpresent employment. It was, however, made clear that release could not inevery case be guaranteed, as the persons sought might be found by the Depart-ments in control of their present work to be engaged in vital war work.The Ministry of Labour and National Service have recently modified thescheme to provide (a) for temporary releases until May next where employers are unwilling to agree to release for an indefinite period; (b) for the utilisation ofmen known to be available for release to fill vacancies in areas other than their home area, provided they are willing to accept such vacancies.4. Experience has shown that this scheme which is now in operation willnot produce the necessary labour within the time available, and it is unlikely inall cases to ensure that labour is available in the area where it is wanted, since it is thought that comparatively few ex-printing workers will be willing to workoutside their home areas. The names of some 1,300 operatives have so far beensubmitted by the printing industry for this work. Employers have so farindicated that at least 1,250 extra operatives will be required for the work. Someof this extra staff is needed in areas where the nominations are insufficient. Ofthe nominations so far received, agreement to release had been secured by the16th January in some 350 cases. Some 650 cases were found to be not availablefor transfer because either they were employed in certain vital industries or were too young for transfer and not in Medical Grades III or IV, or were conditionallyregistered conscientious objectors. This class also included men who were unwilling to accept the specific vacancy offered, and all cases where the employer[29121]SECRET.W.P. (45) 62.26th January, 1945.
was unwilling to agree to release In all cases where the agreement of the employer was not obtained, tJhe Ministry of Labour and National Service ispressing its request, but even where ultimate agreement is reached, the timenecessary to secure this agreement would result in the labour not being availablesufficiently early to be of any practical use. In fact, by the 16th January onlyforty printing operatives had actually been returned to the printing trade for thepurpose of producing the Parliamentary Register.5. The position at the present time is that some quarter of the electorateof about 30 million persons is covered by contracts Which are not subject to lalabour condition. A further half of the electorate. (i.e., some 15 million) is covered by contracts which are contingent on the supply of additional labour,which is not at present forthcoming. . Of the remaining 1\ million it is hopedthat about 4 million may be covered by further negotiation, including the use ofmultigraphing methods, but there are some 3^ million names for which no provision is at present in sight.6. The Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association have been approached with an enquiry as to the facilities which they could offer for production if an ad hoeRegister had to be produced for a General Election before the Register to bepublished on the 7th May is available, and a firm offer for the production of2,225,000 names has been received. The Newspaper Society, representing theprovincial press, is also anxious to assist to the best of its ability, but their resources are already in some measure being used for the production of the MayRegister. It is intended to ask the London Newspapers to allow the offer theyhave made as regards an ad hoc Register to be implemented in connection with theproduction of the May Register.7. Even however if the newspaper resources were used to the full, we aresatisfied that the necessary labour for the production of a Register on the7th May will not be forthcoming within the existing framework. It is true that within certain narrow limits difficulties may be overcome by having a Registermultigraphed, but the necessary facilities for multigraphing do not exist inthe large majority of County areas where the position &quot;is particularly acute.In such places Registration Officers, or the Clerks to District Councils, to whomthe preparation of a Register has been entrusted have not the necessary typistsavailable for this purpose, and are indeed very hard put to secure the servicesof such people for their day-to-day electoral requirements. If, therefore, theRegister is to be published on the date required by the present Bill and even,then it may, in may cases, be necessary to postpone the publication of the listson the 15th March and to omit a reprint of the lists consequent on claims and\ objections -it seems to us imperative that the Ministry of Labour should havespecific Cabinet authority to over-ride forthwith any objections by the controlling Departments to the temporary release of printing operatives atpresent engaged on work for those Departments. It also seems essential, in orderto secure the availability of labour in areas where an insufficient number of names of printing operatives have been submitted, for the Ministry of Labour to beempowered to direct ex-printing operatives for this purpose where the supplyof labour cannot be met by other means. We also ask that the Cabinet should instruct the Service Departments to give sympathetic consideration to applica-tions for the release, temporarily, of printing operatives who are members of theforces stationed in this country.8. We regret having to ask for the sanction of measures which are, we appreciate, somewhat drastic, but if these measures are not agreed and carriedout forthwith it must be recognised that in very many areas the publicationof a Register on the 7th May will not be possible, and it is clearly the duty of theGovernment to see that the Register is produced in accordance with law.J.
