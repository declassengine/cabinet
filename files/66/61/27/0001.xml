(THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S E C R.E T COPY NO. 3 g3.0th January,  19U5*WAR CABINETNEGOTIATIONS WITH SWEDEN:    coal memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and PowerWhilst I fully appreciate the argument of the.Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Economic Warfare, regret that I cannot-agree to either of the alternatives setout in paragraph 5 of his Memorandum (W.P. (us:) 67).2.       The allocation of coal for export is at present thesubject of combined planning by the Combined Production and resources Board.3.       During the first twelve months after the end ofhostilities&apos;in Europe there is likely to be a shortage ofcoal supplies and the dispersal of exportable surpluses will therefore have to be carefully planned.     Proposals for the setting up of a European Coal Organisation to this end havealready been made to the United States, the Soviet.Union andFrance and it is hoped that discussions thereon will beginshortly.h.       Pending the outcome of these discussions I do not see how any commitments for supplies of coal after the cessation of European hostilities can be made by this country to anyother European country.5&apos;*       Further, no promise, express or implied, about coal supplies can well be made to any country without knowledgeof the availability and requirements of coal.6,        In any event, as previously stated in L.P,(hh-) 165 andL.P. (h-h-) 195, there is likely to be little, if any, exportable surplus of coal from this country during the first twelvemonths after the cessation of hostilities in Europe.Go  LI.
