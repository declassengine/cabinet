noTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.C    SECRET. Copy No.   36W.P. (45) 69.30th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.ELEVENTH REPORT OF THE SHIPPING COMMITTEE.The Year 1944.1. In our Tenth Report, issued last November (W.P. (44) 619), we estimatedthat non-tanker imports for the year 1944 might amount to some 25-4 million tons. In fact they fell slightly short of that figure, and amounted to 25-3 million tons. (Both the estimated and the recorded figures given above include a hundred thousand tons of timber imported. on United States Army account which are excluded from the table given below.)2. The following table shows the departmental division of imports in 1944and the effect on stocks at the end of the year : *Table I.January-December 1944.(Million tons.)	Imports.

Food stocks at end 1944, though somewhat lower than at end 1943, were higher than in any earlier year. It has to be borne inmind, however, that these stocks are liable to be drawn on to the extent of some450,000 tons by S.H.A.E.F. to meet the civil affairs requirements of liberated areas.t Stocks of materials at end-1944, though not at a critically low level, werelower than at a similar period of any year since 1939.The First Quarter of 1945.3. It appears probable, on the basis of loadings already arranged or insight, that an import of rather less than 6 million tons will be attained in thefirst quarter of 1945. This total will be divided among the departmental pro-grammes somewhat as follows : Food, 2 - 8 million tons; materials, 2 - 8 million tons and Munitions, &amp;c, -4 million tons.* For details regarding particular commodities see Statistical Appendix.f This includes 21,000 tons of food originally destined for the Continent but diverted tothis country.[29138] b
4 The following table shows what the stock position will be like at theend of March if departmental imports are as has been assumed above. Certaincommitments exist to supply food and materials from United Kingdom stocks for the civilian requirements of liberated areas. These have been separatelyspecified in the following tables in order to free the Net Consumption estimatesfrom an element which has nothing to do with domestic needs *Table II.January-March 1945.(Million tons.)

Net consumption of food and feeding-stuffs shows an increase of some12 per.cent, over the figure for the corresponding period last year. This increase is due to a reduction in the quantity of wheat from home production (over200,000 tons), to increased animal feeding (partly on account of the reduction inthe extraction rate). The stock reduction of 470,000 tons will bring food stocksby end-March to within 680,000 tons of the minimum stocks considered reasonableby the recent review carried out jointly by the Ministry of Food and the americans. Outstanding commitments to S.H.A.E.F. are estimated at some340,000 tons, leaving a net margin of 340,000 tons.6. Net consumption &quot;of materials is slightly in excess of the figure for thecorresponding period of last year. By end-March stocks of materials will be ata lower level than at any time in the course of the Avar.The First Half of 1945.7. While 13-2 million tons remains the target import for the first months of 1945, the War Cabinet have decided that we might accept a cut of not more than 500,000 tons as a contribution towards meeting the approvedimport programmes of the liberated areas provided that the balance of these programmes is met from outside sources and that the loss of 500,000 tons to united Kingdom Imports in the first half of 1945 is made good to us in thesecond half of the year (W.M. (45) 11th Conclusions, of the 15th January).8. The following tables show what the stock position will be like, at mid-1945 (a) assuming that imports attain the target level of 13-2 million tons and(&amp;.) assuming an import of 12-7 million tons, thus involving a -total import cut of 500,000 tons which might fall as to 370,000 tons on Food, and 130,000 tonson Materials.Table III.(Assuming an import of 13-2 million tons.)January-June 1945.(Million tons.)

With an import of 5-83 million tons, as shown in Table IV above, food stocks at mid-year would be some 280,000 tons, in import equivalent, above theminimum necessary stock level as agreed with the United States Mission for economic Affairs.10. Stocks of raw materials at mid-1945, on the assumption of an import of 6-07 million tons, will be some 2-9 million tons below the &quot; required &quot; level, as estimated by the Ministry of Production; i.e., pipeline stocks plus an addition fqrcontingencies acknowledged by the United States Mission for Economic affairs to be not excessive.Signed on behalf of the Committee :HAPvCOURT JOHNSTONE, Chairman.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,30th January, 1945. -[29138]Table IV.(Assuming an import of 12-7 million tons.)January-June 1945.
