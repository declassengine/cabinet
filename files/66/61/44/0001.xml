I am much exercised by the problem of providing for the large number ofGerman prisoners now in our hands, or likely to be captured in the next few months.2. The problem is a two-fold one. A decision is necessary at once upon measuresto meet the threatened outbreak of disease in the over-crowded prison camps across theChannel; while the recent operational development of the war in Europe makes it essential to frame plans for coping with the large numbers of German prisoners of war we may expect to have to accommodate in the coming months. The main difficultiesconcern accommodation, shipping and guards for the disposal and control of the prisoners.The immediate problem.3. 21 Army Group at present have prisoner of war camps of a total normal capacityof 39,000 on austerity scales: into these camps at present 56,700 prisoners are crowded.At two of these camps conditions are so bad that an epidemic of diphtheria is feared,and I am being pressed to accept in this country immediately 7,500 prisoners to reducethe risk of an epidemic, and, further, to accept another 20,000 from the middle ofFebruary to enable 21 Army Group to handle the large captures which may be expected from then onwards. Plans are being implemented to make available accommodationunder 21 Army Group for a further 45,000 prisoners; but little of this will be readybefore April, and S.H.A.E.F. are pressing the War Office to take over from the americans some 42,000 additional prisoners, which the British are in fact liable toaccept under the 50:50 agreement referred to in paragraph 6 and set out in detail in annex B.4. Diphtheria is at present prevalent in the Low Countries. If an epidemic were to start among the German prisoners in Belgium, and the present overcrowded conditionsthere are very favourable to such an outbreak, it would be difficult to find hospitalfacilities for treating it, since available hospital accommodation is being cleared so faras possible in anticipation of operational casualties in the next few weeks. Despite the opinions expressed at the meeting of the War Cabinet on 7th November, 1944 (W.M.(44) 147, Item 3), against the acceptance of further large numbers of German prisoners in this country, I feel that no other course is open to me in order to meet the present emergency but to bring the 7,500 German prisoners over from Belgium at once, andthe further 20,000 later this month, if large captures make this course necessary. these numbers can be accommodated in the present camps in this, country, at the price of postponing the amelioration of the overcrowding now existing at the prisoner of warcamps here, and by the use of tentage, which is contrary to the Geneva Conventionduring the winter.The long-term problem.5. There is general agreement that the closing stages of the German war may beexpected to yield German prisoners in large numbers. What numbers will be involved,and over how long a period, no one can say; but S.H.A.E.F.&apos;s forecast is at Annex A,and the War Office can do no better than work upon that forecast for the present.6. At Annex A are also set out details of the total numbers of German prisoners to be taken&apos;into consideration. In reaching the total of 709,000, it has been assumed that the present arrangement (set out in Annex B) stands as regards the incidence of
responsibility, between Britain and America, for prisoners captured in joint theatres ofwar. Briefly, this agreement means that captures in joint Anglo-American operations in any theatre are equally divided between the Americans and ourselves after deductingany prisoners captured by a third Power, such as the French; this agreement was,however, not to affect the previous arrangement made in September, 1942, whereby the Americans agreed to take 150,000, later raised to 175,000, British owned prisoners in the United States.7. To accommodate about 700,000 prisoners, there will be available, On reasonableausterity scales, accommodation for 170,000 prisoners in the United Kingdom and 84,000in 21 Army Group (details are in Annex A); by severe overcrowding (austerity scalesplus fifty per cent.), we might put about 370,000 prisoners in this accommodation here and abroad, though their conditions would in that case fall considerably short of therequirements of the Geneva Convention.In paragraphs 10 to 17 below, I indicate various ways in which some alleviation ofthe liabilities falling upon this country may accrue, but it would be unwise to counttoo confidently upon assistance from those sources.8. Many considerations militate against the possibility of bringing large numbers ofadditional German prisoners to this country. I am being subjected to increasing pressure by many interests to de-requisition properties held by the War Office for thepurposes of the war, and that pressure will increase as summer approaches, particularly if the end of the German war turns the public mind more to thoughts of holidays. Ifthe number of prisoners coming to this country could be reduced, I could, of course,put British soldiers into the accommodation thus released, and, correspondingly, de-requisition properties the Army now occupies for its own troops. Further, the WarOffice have to provide accommodation in this country for all British Commonwealthprisoners of war liberated by the Armies in their advance on the Western Front theestimate is 170,000: in addition, U.S.A. ask us to accommodate some 96,000 Americanprisoners of war similarly released; the intention is to evacuate liberated prisoners in heavy bomber aircraft and it is contended that the Americans must come to this countrysince nowhere else are there airfields at which the bombers can land. The length oftime during which American ex-prisoners of war would thus be accommodated in theUnited Kingdom turns on the availability of shipping space for their repatriation tothe United States: at present, all available shipping space is devoted to repatriatingAmerican wounded and convalescent men. About half of the 96,000 American ex-prisoners might be put in accommodation likely to be available; but it looks as though some 25,000 at any one time will have to be put into accommodation which would otherwise have been available for German prisoners of war.9. The provision of guards represents another aspect of the problem. Alreadysome 22,000 troops are employed on guard duties in the United Kingdom, and that number may well be trebled for guarding our full commitment of prisoners, set out above. Although the provision of guards does not necessarily constitute a net loss tothe country&apos;s manpower since there is compensation in the prisoner of war labour itself,it is not always possible to locate prisoners in areas where they can be fully employed,and often small camps which would otherwise be suitable are not used owing to theuneconomical demand for guards and administrative personnel which their use would entail.10. In view of the accommodation difficulties in this country and the reluctance ofmy colleagues to have large additional numbers of German prisoners brought here,various alternative proposals for putting these Germans elsewhere have been explored.11. The French have offered to accept 50,000 from S.H.A.E.F. (of whom 25,000should come from 21 Army Group), subject to our providing food, clothing and armsfor. guards, who may have to be coloured troops. S.H.A.E.F. have been asked. to approach the Belgian and Dutch Governments similarly, but it is unlikely that the response will be favourable since both countries have a number of unemployed and little demand for prisoner of war labour.12. The French Government are also being urged, through diplomatic channels, totake about 50,000 prisoners of war in North-West Africa; if this is eventually agreed,it will be on the same conditions as stipulated above for France, and it will not bepossible to avoid having coloured troops set to guard prisoners there.13. The United States Chiefs of Staff have refused our request to accept any moreBritish owned prisoners of war in America, on the grounds that shortage of men forguards makes it impossible to employ more German labour, while the United Statespublic would resent prisoners being kept in idleness: for the same reason, they insist that American owned prisoners should be held on the Continent of Europe. TheAmerican agreement (see Annex B) to accept 175,000 British owned prisoners in the
United States has so far relieved us of the necessity for accommodating prisoners trans-ferred to us under the 50:50 agreement; but the increasing disparity in the numbersof American and British forces engaged in North-West Europe will impose on theUnited Kingdom an impossible burden under the 50:50 agreement. It will be seen from the figures in Annex A that, under this agreement, our share of the forecastedAmerican captures from 1st January, 1945, up to the end of organized resistance wouldbe some 205,000 prisoners; this number does not include the 42,000 (the balance ofour share of captures prior to 1st January, 1945) which S.H.A.E.F. are already pressingus to accept [see paragraph 3).14. Canada has been urged, through the Dominions Office, to take 50,000 moreprisoners, but the Canadian Government have refused to do so, allegedly on account ofthe delicate political situation arising out of the reinforcement question. Canada, it istrue, now holds 34,000 prisoners, but Canadian captures in North-West Europe aloneamount to 66,000, and it is proposed to urge the Canadian Government to reconsider their refusal.15. A.F.H.Q. already hold 13,500 German prisoners, and Middle East hold 36,000:the latter have agreed to accept 10,000 more, with the possibility of a further 20,000, butthe difficulty in that case is in finding guards.16. Other Dominions and overseas Commands have not been asked as yet to takemore prisoners, owing to shipping difficulties and the problem of finding guards; butthey have been asked to notify their requirements for prisoner of war labour for reconstruction purposes after the German war ends.17. From all the above sources, we may obtain relief in our prisoner of warproblem to the extent of, say, some 403,000, but at the price of continuing a good dealof overcrowding in the prisoner of war camps, and also of postponing the process of de-requisitioning of properties occupied by the War Office in this country.iS. I accordingly ask the approval of the War Cabinet to the following:  (a) the immediate acceptance in the United Kingdom of 7,500 prisoners from21 Army Group, and of a further 20,000, if necessary, during the course ofthe present month;(b) negotiations with the Americans to replace the present 50:50 agreement by onewhereby each nation accepts responsibility for its own captures;(c) subject to (6) above being satisfactorily arranged, acceptance of the commit-ment to accommodate in this country American prisoners of war liberated onthe Western Front until they can be repatriated to the United States;(d) action, in conjunction with the Foreign Office, Dominions Office, S.H.A.E.F.and others concerned, designed to obtain the maximum acceptance ofGerman prisoners of war in France, Belgium and Holland, in the UnitedStates and Canada, in North-West Africa, in the Middle East and in otherDominions, etc., as opportunity offers.P.

DETAILS OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THEU.S.A. ON THE SUBJECT OF PRISONERS OF WAR.I. In September, 1942, it was provisionally agreed that the U.S.A. would take 150,000 Britishowned prisoners of war.   This figure was subsequently raised to 175,000.2. For the Tunisian campaign, it had been, agreed that all prisoners evacuated westward shouldbe an American responsibility and all those evacuated eastward should be a British responsibility.In fact, nearly all the prisoners were evacuated westwards, though American captures only amountedto 45,000. It was, therefore, agreed that all prisoners evacuated westwards in excess of 45,000should count against the 175,000 mentioned in 1 above.3. On 12th August, 1943, the following agreement was made through the Combined Chiefs ofStaff and was notified in C.C.S. 276/3 : (a) Captures in joint operations should be equally divided in the theatre after deduction of those captured by a third Power. This applied to all captures subsequent to12th May, 1943.(b) Nevertheless, prisoners in the British share could be sent to U.S.A. up to a maximum of175,000 as in 1 above.(c) The problem of future captures to be considered in the light of the greatest economy inshipment, guards, etc., and of security.4. The maximum of 175,000 at 1 above in the U.S.A. has now been reached.. &apos;&apos; IISTATEMENT OF PRISONERS OF WAR HELD BY BRITISH commonwealth and U.S.A.The British Commonwealth now hold 295,000 Germans and 380,000 Italians. The U.S.A. hold604,000 Germans and 120,000 Italians.   The detailed distribution is as follows:
