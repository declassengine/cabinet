6-t.-^f*,-*.-c..4rTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet. January- 1945.SECRET. &apos; Copy No.     36(     W.P. (43) 52.   :25th January, 19k&amp;:.,WAR CABINET.THE COAL POSITION-Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power.THE Prime Minister has asked me to circulate to the War Cabinet an exchange of minutes, dated the 8th and 9th January, about the coal situation inthis country. ; w*-: I should now add that, in the two weeks following, production, which had&apos;shown an improvement in December, has not reached the level anticipated, andWas only 3,600,000 tons last week. This is in part due to the severe weatherCQnditions* and also to increased sickness. As consumption has again increased(in the week ending the 13,th January the consumption of coal by gas and electricity undertakings was the highest ever recorded) it may be necessary for meto re-programme the allocation of coal to industry,, and this would affect theestimated stock levels at the 30th April.During the same- period difficulties in distributing house coal in London,arising mainly from the labour shortage, referred to in paragraph 5 of my minute of the 9th January, reached serious dimensions. As I informed the House ofCommons yesterday, it has been necessary, with the help of other ministers concerned, to take special steps to meet the position. In particular, recourse hasbeen had to the Pioneers, of whom 400 will be at work by next Monday morning.I have also instituted local &apos;&apos; cash-and-carry &apos;&apos; schemes, which are already provingof considerable assistance.vjr. s^L..  or.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1.251h January, 1945.A.- Minister of Fuel and Power.I am anxious about the coal position not only this winter but in Stage II.I understand that you have limited our commitment to supply S.H.A.E.F. to1 - 9 million tons, and I hope you will not make any further commitment without consulting me.(Signed) W. S. C.8th January, 1945.B. Prime Minister.1. In this country coal supplies are tight, but not seriously so. Press reportsof widespread shortages have not been based on fact.* I learn this morning (25th January) that severe frosts and heavy falls of snow are seriously affecting coal production in the North and in South Wales.[29110]35
2. I give below a table showing the present stocks held by the principalconsumers, together with an estimate of the position at the end of the winter : GasElectricityRailwaysEssential IndustryHouse   Coal   in   Mer-chants&apos; DepotsActual Stock at30th December.1944-516 12-86-313(1943.)(Winter(4-7)(6-3)(4-4)(5-5)(2-0)Estimated Stock at30th April.Weeks&apos;1945.Supply.)3032North 3South 48J0-5(1944.)(3-5)(4-1)(3-3)(4-0)(1-3)Government EmergencyReserve&apos; Stock (thou-sand tons)   ...... 2,200       (2,390) 1,150       (2,200)Opencast Coal on Site(thousand tons)      ... 2,700       (1,740) 1,900       (2,500)3. These figures are based on the assumption that a total of 1 - 9 million tonswill be supplied to S.H.A.E.F. during the period the 1st December, 1944-the30th April, 1945. This supply was approved by the Lord Presidents Committeeon the 8th December; 1944.4. I am not yet in a position to make any proposals about coal supplies for s.H.A.E.F. after the 30th April, 1945. Our contribution in the higher qualities,such as locomotive and domestic coal, can at best be small. It is doubtful whethershipping could be made available to bring coal from the United States. I have therefore-impressed on all concerned the urgency of increasing the production ofindigenous coal in North-West Europe. - 15. The most serious difficulty facing me at present is a shortage of labour-at gas and electricity undertakings, and for coal distribution (especially inLondon). The transport of coal has been satisfactory so far, though some difficulty has been experienced in the movement of opencast coal from stock.6. After the 30th April, 1945, I cannot budget for any large exportable surplus without an accretion of experienced labour, but I consider we shall beable to meet home demands.7. I will enter into no further commitments with S.H.A.E.F. without prior consulation with you.(Signed) G. Ll. G.Ministry of Fuel and Power,- 7 Millbank, S.W.1,9th January, 1945.
