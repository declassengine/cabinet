(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)c .---------------------secret.?.(k5) 602TO JANUARY. 19k5.WAR CABIKETRAW MATERIAL IMPORTS.  JANUARY - JUNE 1945.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.Annex I to this paper gives estimates of imports, home production and net consumption of raw materials over the periodJanuary to June 1945 on the assumption that the arrivals programmeof 6.2 m. tons is achieved.    It will be seen that, on present estimates, overall stocks will fall by 1.14 m. .tons over the period.This follows on a reduction in 1944 of 1.51 m. tons.    Stocks atthe end of June next will be lower than at any time since the endof 1939.No allowance has been made in the figures for shipments toliberated areas from U.K. stocks.    In the first six months of 1945we have already undertaken to supply about 90,000 tons of rawmaterials and there are provisional commitments for an additional160,000 tons.    In general these commitments are  of materialswhere we are comparatively well stocked.2.     Annexes II and III contain an analysis of the estimated stock position at the end of June 1945 undertaken in conjunction with theAmerican Mission for Economic Affairs in London.    In the resultoverall stocks will then be nearly 2.8 m. tons below the &quot;required&quot;level, i.e, pipeline stocks plus an addition for contingencies -as estimated by us which M.E.A. have acknowledged to be adequate &apos;andnot excessive.3.     It will&apos; be seen from the table to the report referred to in para. 2 how the position of individual items varies as comparedwith the required level.    The deficits are mainly in the steel and steel-making materials and timber groups while non-ferrous metals and textile materials are in a more favourable position.In the case of the &quot;-deficit&quot; groups this does not of course mean that essential requirements will not be met but that we shall notbe fully protected against any sudden upswing in demand or any .substantial dislocation of shipping.    The more- favourable positionof some other groups is due to a number of causes.    Wool, forinstance, where stocks a*e high, is carried f*om the Antipodesin refrigerated tonnage as filled cargo while cotton is drawnlargely and jute entirely fsom the Indian Ocean area where home-ward tonnage is available,, as the result of operations.    Continuous .consultation is maintained with Ministry of War Transport on thequestion of obtaining a better distribution of homeward tonnagefrom&quot; the point of view of raw material imports e.g. by increasingiron ore shipments from the Mediterranean at the expense ofmaterials in a better st^stock position...COPY NO.

a xe u4.   . It is inevitable that for some time to come any. curtail-ment of imports will tend to fall on parts of the raw materialsprogramme where stocks are less-able to stand the strain.    Inparticular, it has been found by experience that any cuts in tonnage available to the import programme unless made&apos; over along period to allow for redistribution   of ships tend under present conditions to be made on the N; American run.   about one-third of the present raw materials imports are being drawn from N, American sources.    This part of the programme willhave to be cut and it can least bear it because it consists of practically all our imported supplies of softwoods and ofa wide range of miscellaneous materials such as chemicals,paper and pulp etc. where stocks are comparatively low.5.      Cf the reduction in stocks of 1.14 m. tons over January -June 1945 referred to in para. 1, it should be pointed outthat nearly 800,000 tons will occur in the first q/aartar of theyear as compared with 350,000 in the second quarter.    This unevendistribution makes it all the more necessary that the programme for the second quarter should not be cut.6. I do not feel therefore that it is possible to suggest any reduction in the U.K. raw materials import programme of6.2 m. tons&apos; over the period January - June 1945.(initialled)    O.L.Ministry of Production9S.

.a1nex ii .. memor.utoula by h.e.a.l.january 20, 1945subject:    required UK stocks of imported raw materials,/l. the ministry of production and Mission for economic id? fairs &apos;agreed two years ago on estimates of pipeline stocks required for theimportant raw materials in the dry cargo import program. -  these pipe-line stocks are defined to be:the smallest amounts necessary to maintain a continuousefficient flow of material into all stages of production - fromstocks at the ports through to stocks at consumers&apos; plants.these pipeline stocks would thus bo adequate to meet the wartimestresses and strains&apos; of the internal UK distribution and production systems, but provide no margin for interruptionor abnormal fluctuations in imports.in 1944 the original estimates and the definition were reviewed in thelight of the conditions then prevailing.and certain revisions weremade in the pipeline estimates,     although the war situation has changed in some respects since this last review, there is no reason tobelieve that the present pipeline stock estimates are unrealistic.    insome respects they may be a little high; - but in others they may be low,particularly since the original allowance for inland transport did not envisage the tight conditions now prevailing.     the estimates of pipelinestocks are shown in the attached table under the caption &quot;agreedpipeline&quot;.2. in. addition to these pipeline stocks there&quot; is a contingency reservevdiich the minister of. production considers necessary in order to carryout his various-obligations.      this is shown in the attached table(annex iii) and represents approximately thirteen weeks1 net-consumption   (i.er. total consumption less home production) of thedifferent imported materials because this is the period which experience shows is required to correct a short supply position.      this contingency reserve is designed primarily to cover shipping difficulties.    pipeline,stocks assume regular and frequent imports.      in actuality, however.,arrivals are irregular, port assignments may be inconvenient for certainmaterials,, and there are still losses at sea.      in addition to theseshipping difficulties, of course,  there is also the factor   of war risksin the UK against which some allowance is required.     the contingencyreserves shown here do not contain any element of insurance againstworld supply shortages,  e.g. of jute. - ;the mop has not asked mea to agree to these contingency reservefigures since such tstimates must necessarily be their own decision,mea has examined the figures, however, and is of the opinion that theyare adequate for the purpose and ere not unduly excessive.3. the agreed pipeline plus the contingency reserve constitutes totalrequired stocks shown in the attached table.     it should be emphasizedthat these required stocks make no allowance for emergency shipmentsout of UK stocks of raw materials to liberated areas in europe.    in thefirst six months of 1945 the UK has already undertaken to supply about90,000 tons of rav/ materials covered by the present report.   &quot; in

addition, they arc under a provisional couunitraent for an additional140,000 tons.     Finally, these actual and provisional corxiitmentsdo not include any tjuontities   of &apos;raw materials that may hesupplied from the UK to Europe under the LlOS/GPh purchasingprogram.For purposes of illustration the required stocks as set forth in Section 1 and 2 above are compared with actual end December1944 stocks, forecast end March 1945 stocks, and programmed endJune 1945 stocks in the attached table, assuming the rawmaterials import program of 6.2 million tons in the first halfof 1945 is fulfilled.-5-/
