(THIS D0CUMS3TT IS THE PROPERTY&quot; OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENTSSgGRSTi 2th October, 19^war cabinet united STATES COLOURED TROOPS IN the copy NO,UNITED KING-DOMMemorandum by the Minister of InformationAs the Minister charged &quot;by the War Cabinet with the responsibility forco-ordinating civilian hospitality to the American troops in this country I have&apos;&quot;been brought into constant touch with the problem of defining what attitude weshould wish the people of this country to adopt towards the American coloured troops.It may be of some assistance to the War Cabinet, in view of the divergencies ofopinion that seem to have arisen, if I indicate briefly the line of advice that Ihave throughout offered on this subject,   Ths substance of it is contained in aletter which I.&quot; wrote to the Secretary of State for War on the 16th September last,and I will quote the relevant passages here:&quot;It seems to me that the first thing to realise Is that the Americans haveexported to us a local problem which Is not of our own making and that there is noconceivable prospect of its bein^; solved on this side in any way that is completelysatisfactory.   Therefore, I deprecate general discussions of it, which tend more todiagnosis than cure.I am sure that the American policy of segregation is the best practicalcontribution to the avoidance of trouble.   Let us second it in every way.,.. But it isnot always achieved, nor is it always capable of being achieved.   In such circumstances, our public is oonscious of a divided allegiance: their sense of sympathy and protectiveness towards the black troops conflicts with their wish to respect the feelings of the white troops among us,   I cannot feel that we ought byany process, visible or invisible, to try to lead our own people to adopt as theirown the American social attitude to the American negro: nor should we succeed.   ButI think that we ought most certainly to do what we can to make those who will bebrought into contact with both white and black Americans aware of the problem, ofthe attitude of both sides, of the social background in which they have grown up:and to encourage them to use all their tact to avoid offending or insulting the whiteAmerican in their relations with the black,I think that the Service Departments can fairly taokle this subject among theirown personnel owing to the peculiar relations between officers and men, especiallyin the Women&apos;s Services,   Even here I feel that written documents should be avoidedas well as the didactic approach........I do not think that the mass of the civilian population ought to be approachedat all with any propaganda on the subject,   A wrong step would be disastrous, andthere is not sufficient prospect of .any real success, however wise one&apos;s attitude.Incidentally, the essential agents of national hospitality are the VoluntarySocieties, with whom we are working closely.   Their fundamental principles are involved in the doctrine of no racial discrimination&quot;.
