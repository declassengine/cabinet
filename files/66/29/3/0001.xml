Copy Ho.   .51-_WAR CABINETCompensation for War Damage in Malta.C Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.1.       A question has arisen relating to the problem ofcompensation for War Damage in Malta.    It involves somewhat wideissues, and I have therefore thought it right to bring it beforethe War Cabinet for their consideration.A War Damage Bill is at present before the MaltaLegislature.    This Bill follows the lines of the United KingdomWar Damage Act 19U1.   As regards buildings, it provides forcontributions from owners, and as regards personal belongings and business equipment, it provides for insurance schemes on the UnitedKingdom model.    It throws, formally, upon the Malta Government a liability for meeting any excess of the cost of compensation overthe receipts from contributions and premiums.    The bulk of thiscost of compensation will of course fall to be paid after the war,when the Malta Government will be faced with heavy liabilities for reconstruction over the whole field of administration.    Ifnormal financial procedure were followed,  all these liabilities,including the liability for war damage compensation, would remain,in form,&quot;a charge on the Malta taxpayer.    But,  in fact, theUnited Kingdom Exchequer would make up, by means of a grant in aid to the -Malta&apos; Government,  the difference between the totalexpenditure and the total revenue of the Colony.2.       The Governor is not happy about the effect of such proposals as these upon the people of Malta at the present time,and he has recommended, as an alternative, that war damagecompensation in Malta should be dealt with as a separate issue, andthat His Majesty&apos;s Government should give an immediate undertaking that the whole cost, less the contributions and premiums, will beborne by the Imperial Government.3.       I fully recognise that the Governor1s proposal raises,wide issues.    Malta is not the only Colony that has suffered fromthe war, and the financial implications of war damage throughoutthe Colonial Empire are so vast that I recently agreed with theChancellor of the Exchequer,  as a general proposition, that nopromises of financial support by the Imperial Government towards thecost of compensation schemes should be given to Colonial Governmentsuntil the end of the war, when liabilities can be defined.    this general rule does not indeed cover the case of Malta, which hasalready been recognised as being in a special category.    But, if apublic guarantee,, such as the Governor suggests, is given to Malta,an Act of Parliament will be needed to implement it, and this isno doubt likely to bring to the fore, both in Parliament and in theColonies-themselves, the position of other areas which have also suffered.    I am indeed already being subjected to pressure toprovide, in advance, a guarantee&apos; in respect &apos;of war damage in malaya.    Finally, the absence of a guarantee to Malta will notin practice mean that the Imperial Government will not providethe funds to defray the costs of compensation beyond what Malta canpay.
pay.    On the contrary, this will in any case be provided, bygrant in aid, and a public statement to this effect has alreadybeen made.h.       These arguments are no doubt formidable.    But there are,1 submit, at least equally strong considerations on the other side.If it could be argued that there was any likelihood of the malta government being able 1fo make any substantial contribution tothe cost of war damage, no doubt the case against the Governor&apos;proposal would be overwhelming.    But there is no such likelihood.Malta is not, like Malaya, an area-with immense natural resources.It is a very small island with a very large population.    As theGovernor has pointed out, it is certain that all, and more than all,the revenue which can be raised after the war from local sourceswill be required for other purposes, social services, education andso on.    The damage to prope??ty as a result of enemy attacks isenormous.    It is estimated that it already amounts.-  in respect of buildings alone,  to the sun: of  6,500,000 as against a total valueof contributory property of  22,000,000, and this proportion mayeasily be increased before the war is over.    It may bo taken ascertain that nine tenths at least of the cost of war damage will inany ca.se have to he paid by the Imperial Government.    -Ye shall therefore,  financially, lose nothing by giving the proposed guarantee,And, politically, we shall gain enormously by a generous gesture.Indeed, the Governor has indicated that a failure on our part togive the guarantee will be likely to have a deplorable effect on the morale of the Maltese.    They will not understand it.    It may even bedifficult to pass the legislation without it,  and, he says, a refusalon our part will at best lead to bitter controversy and debate.This is borne oui oy others whom I have consulted.    I can imagine   &apos;nothing more unfortunate in the present situation of Malta thanthat,  after all the island has endured in the Allied cause, we should give an impression of meanness towards her.5.       Weighing therefore the arguments on both sides,  I amclear in my own mind that this is a case where we should make an exception to the general rule.    Malta,  at the present time, stands in a class entirely by itself.    The very special services whichthe Island and the Maltese people have rendered to the allied cause, their magnificent resistance and endurance under muchsuffering and hardship, the scale of the damage inflicted by theenemy, and the poverty.of the island&apos;s natural resources surely&apos;justify the grant of a special concession which may well have to be withheld or.reserved in other cases.S.        I therefore ask my colleagues to agree :-(i)    that the Governor may be authorised to announce in malta that it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto invite Parliament to pass legislation whereby the wholecoot of war damage compensation in Malta which may fall tobe borne by public funds will be paid by the ImperialGovernment;(ii)    that a similar announcement should be made simultaneously in Parliament in this country^(iii)    that the necessary legislation should be preparedfor introduction into Parliament as soon as possible.Colonial Office,September 22nd, 1942,
