V -this document is the property OF his britannic majestvs governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.  October 1942.SECRET. Copy No.   ,W.P. (42) 442.October 2, 1942.WAR CABINET.UNITED STATES COLOURED TROOPS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE presence of a large number of coloured American troops in the UnitedKingdom presents a difficult problem for the Colonial Office as well as the WarOffice. It seems to the Colonial Office to raise two aspects of the colour questionwhich are intimately related to each other. The first is the position of Britishcoloured persons whether in or out of uniform, and the second is the positionof American coloured troops.2. British coloured persons in the United Kingdom and in the Coloniesare.extremely sensitive to colour discrimination, and it is our effort to secure bothin the Colonies and in this country equality of treatment for all races. We have brought over to this country numbers of technicians from the West Indies, offoresters from British Honduras, and there are also considerable numbers of coloured persons serving in the Army, and the Air Force, brought over to thiscountry under special schemes and serving alongside white men. Some of thesecoloured persons in the Services have also been recruited in this country. Wehave done everything we can to encourage good relations, and in this we havehad a large measure of success. There are also numbers of coloured Colonialcivilians, students, seamen and residents.3. As the American attitude towards coloured persons is very largelydifferent from the attitude we adopt in this country towards our own coloured people, the Colonial Office feels that the American authorities should be madefully aware of this attitude, and also of the fact that there are numbers of ourown coloured people in the United Kingdom, and that they should be asked to respect our attitude towards these people.4. I consider that any lead given to the British people in this country,asking them to adopt the attitude of the American Army towards coloured people,whether Americans or others, is likely to cause serious resentment among ourcoloured people in this country and in the Colonies, and also to cause confusion(if not indeed a reaction gravely prejudicial to Anglo-American relations) inthe minds of the public here, who have been asked repeatedly to accept Britishcoloured Colonial persons on equal terms and to extend to them hospitality andfriendliness. I refer particularly to the broadcast made by Mr. Macmillan, theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, on the 28th July, 1942,and to the recent article by Mr. Brendan Bracken in the Sunday Express, bothof which express very clearly the attitude which we would like the British public to take towards our own coloured people.5. I am in full agreement with the proposal made in the War office memorandum that all ranks in the Services should be given a knowledge of thepast history of the colour question in the United States and in the United states army, but I consider that it is going much too far to attempt to ask the british army or the A.T.S. to adopt the attitude of the American Army towardsAmerican coloured people. It should be impressed upon our Service personnelthat this is an American and not a British problem. I suggest that it should then[24435]
be left to them to decide on their own behaviour in the ihatter, and it should bea question of good manners and conduct on the part of our troops and the A.T.S.to avoid giving offence to the United States Army in their attitude to Americancoloured persons.6. I cannot believe that thinking Americans would wish us to adopt theirideas and prejudices any more than they would ours. If the Americans proposeto treat their coloured people in a certain way, we should to some extent conformby not interfering, but we should not take any positive action to imitate theiradministrative or other arrangements.7. To summarise, the Colonial Office ask for agreement to the following-points : (a) There should be no interference with American administrative arrange-ments for segregation within the United States Army, but, in theabsence of such arrangements, the British Authorities should not attempt to provide special arrangements on lines of racial discrimination.(b) The historical and social reasons for the American attitude should be fully and fairly explained to the British Services so as to encourage a proper understanding of the American problem.(c) Similarly, the reasons which differentiate our problem from that of the americans, and which have led to a different attitude towards thequestion on the part of our people, should be explained to the americans, and the American Army should be asked to respect our attitude towards British coloured Colonial people in this country, andto avoid any interference with them that may lead to bad relations.(d) British Service men and women and civilians should be left to draw theirown conclusions as to their behaviour towards coloured Americanswithout official directions as to their conduct in this matter.C.Colonial Office, October 2, 1942.
