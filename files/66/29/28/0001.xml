tStrictly: Confidential.SUBSTANCE OP TELEGRAM FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE dated october 3, m2.(1) With the installing of a new Chinese Ambassador herewe anticipate that we may find the Chinese Government approach-ing the American Government at almost any time regarding thedesire of the Chinese Government to terminate in China thesystem of extraterritorial jurisdiction.    One of the importantreasons why, as we have previously stated, we have felt it -advisable to take some affirmative action with reference tothe question of relinquishing in China extraterritorial rights .at this time has been to show an initiative on the part of theUnited States and Great Britain and to keep the initiative inour hands.(2) We believe, with the foregoing considerations in mind,it would be advisable for the American Government to inform in strict confidence the Chinese Ambassador here and for theBritish Government to inform in strict confidence the ChineseAmbassador in London for their report to the Chinese-Government in strict confidence similarly, that the AmericanGovernment and the British Government for a good many weekshave been giving intensive consideration to the question ofmaking approaches to the Chinese Government directed toward therelinquishment in China of consular jurisdiction and that the study of the American and British Governments has proceeded nowto a point where the American and British Governmentsrespectively expect to present to the Chinese Government withinthe relatively near future for its consideration draft treaties,the conclusion of which would accomplish the described end.(3) At the earliest possible moment please inform Mr.Bdenof the foregoing and tell him that I suggest that the American .Government and the British Government inform orally in the sense indicated the respective Chinese Ambassadors in washington and in London on Friday, October 9th, the Communication-cation of the American Government to be in the forenoon and the communication of the British Government to be in the afternoonwith a view to talcing account of difference in time.(L) Also please inform Mr. Eden that the text of a briefdraft treaty of the nature we have in mind, prepared afterstudy of the comments of the British Foreign Office, the comments of Ambassador Gauss, and the comments which Ambassador Gausshas informed us the British Ambassador at Chungking hasforwarded to the British Government, is being telegraphedseparately.
