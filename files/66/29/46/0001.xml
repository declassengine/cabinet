THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1942.SECRET.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND. KEY.    Copy N*gQW.P. (42) 466.October 13, 1942It Is requested that special care may be taken toonsure the secrecy of this document,WAR CABINET.Mr. MYRON TAYLOR&apos;S VISIT TO ROME.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 6th October I was invited by the United States Ambassador to meet mr. Myron Taylor. Mr. Myron Taylor told me that he had given the PrimeMinister a copy of his memorandum to the Pope (Annex A), and he also showedme a copy of the Pope&apos;s answer. This was in friendly but vague terms and indicated that the Vatican fully understood that the moment was not ripe for peace overtures. It is therefore clear that what appears to have been the main purpose of Mr. Myron Taylor&apos;s journey to Rome was fulfilled, namely, to dis-courage the Vatican from any untimely peace initiative.2. Mr. Myron Taylor had also given the Prime Minister a memorandumby the First Secretary of the United States Legation in Lisbon,, about the Churchin Russia (Annex B), and he gave me a further memorandum on this subject(Annex C) summarising remarks made to him by Mgr. Tardini, the CardinalUhder-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Mr. Myron Taylor also handedme a copy of a memorandum which he had received from Count Dalla Torre,director of the Osservatore Romano, about the anti-Fascist opposition in Italy(Annex D).3. On his return journey, Mr. Myron Taylor told me, he saw both general franco and Dr. Salazar. At the outset of his visit to the former, General Francogave an account of his reasons for believing that Germany would win the war,but when Mr. Myron Taylor spoke of the campaign in Russia General Francoadmitted that it was not likely to be concluded this year. Mr. Myron Taylorformed the impression that Dr. Salazar was now fully convinced of an Alliedvictory.4. Mr. Myron Taylor told me that he was treated throughout with thegreatest courtesy, being conveyed by Italian civil aircraft from Lisbon to Rome.He did not leave the Vatican City, though he was given an opportunity of visitinghis villa in Florence.  From all he heard, the food position in Italy is grave.A. E.Foreign Of/ice, October 13, 1942.11875   [24486;
To&apos;His Holiness Pope Pius XII.A Statement by Myron Taylor made the 19th September. 1942. as a basis onwhich the parallel efforts for a just and moral peace of His Holiness and president Roosevelt may rest.IT is of high importance that, at this juncture when the Allied Powers arepassing to the offensive in the conduct of the War, the attitude of the UnitedStates Government with respect to the present world struggle be- restated to the holy See.Before the war became general, President Roosevelt, in parallel effort withthe Holy See, explored every possible avenue for the preservation of the peace.The experience of those days of fruitful cooperation, when the high moralprestige of the Holy See was buttressed by the civil power of the United Statesof America, is a precious memory. Although totalitarian aggression defeatedthose first efforts to prevent world war. the United States looks forward to furthercollaboration of this kind when the anti-Christian philosophies which have taken the sword shall have perished by the sword, and it will again be possible toorganize world peace.In the just war which they are now waging the people of the United Statesof America derive great spiritual strength and moral encouragement from a review of the utterances of His Holiness Pope Pius XII and of his venerated.Predecessor. Americans, Catholic and non-Catholic, have been profoundlyimpressed by the searing condemnation of Nazi religious persecution pronouncedby Pope Pius XI in his Mit Brennender Sorge; by the elevated teachingon law and human dignity contained in the Sumnii Pontificates of PopePius XII; by the famous Five Points laid down in 1939 by the same Pope asthe essential postulates of a just peace: and by the forthright and heroic-expressions of indignation made by Pope Pius XII when Germany invaded theLow Countries. Now that we are fighting against the very things which thePopes condemned, our conviction of complete victory is one with our confidence in the unwavering tenacitv with which the Holv See will continue its magnificentmoral leading.Because we know we are in the right, and because we have supremeconfidence in our strength, we are determined to carry through until we shallhave won complete victory. The only thing that would make us lay down the arms taken up in defense of national security and world decency would be thecomplete and forthright acceptance of the Atlantic Charter and the Manifestoof the United Nations the provisions of which, by the way, are in substantial agreement with the Holy Father&apos;s above-mentioned postulates for a just and lasting peace. Our cause is just. We fight, with conscience clear, for the moral rights of our nation, and for the liberties of our people; our victory will ensure those rights and liberties to the world. Even our enemies knoT*r chat we seek no aggrandisement. Precisely for the reason that our moral position isimpregnable, we are not open to the compromises usual to&quot;&quot;those who look formerely material gains, and who will bargain for half a loaf if they cannot havethe wdiole. A peace-loving people, we exhausted every honorable means to remain at peace; in the midst of peace negotiations, we were foully attacked byGermany&apos;s partner in the Orient. Like Austria. Czechoslovakia, Poland andthe rest, we were made the victims of Axis aggression at the very moment when their diplomats were talking peace. How then could we have confidence in theword of any Axis Power? In the conviction that anything less than completevictory would endanger the principles we fight for and our very existence as a nation, the United States of America wall prosecute this war until the Axiscollapses. We shall not again allow ourselves to be imperilled from behind whilewre are talking peace with criminal aggressors of the kind referred to in theSummi Pontificals as men without faith to the plighted, word. -Our confidence in final and complete victory is based upon the most objectivefoundations. There is nothing of emotional optimism or wishful thinking in it.We are prepared for a long war. We foresaw early reverses. But, in the end,we know that no nation or combination of nations can stand against us in thefield.In the first place, we are a nation united as never before in our history. Axispropaganda had made itself felt in the United States as elsewhere before our entry into the war, and we know they are boasting of divisions among us.   Let
no one be deceived. Our very love of peace made it difficult for some of our people to see the world menace of nazism. Pearl Harbour opened their eyes.The dishonourable attack of Japan at the very moment when her specialambassador was talking peace at Washington united overnight Americans of allshades of opinion. Among the architects of this unity are the foremost Catholicleaders in our country, the bishops and the prominent laymen of all racial strains.Their public utterances and the editorial statements of Catholic papers afterthe aggression of Pearl Harbour can be summed up in these words: Prosecutethe war to a victorious conclusion; and then bend every effort for a peace thatwill be just, charitable and lasting. Most notable of all Catholic pronouncementswas that contained in the letter of the Catholic Hierarchy to the President ofthe United States pledging the whole-hearted co-operation of Catholics in thenational war effort. This &quot;letter, individually authorized by the Bishops of theUnited States, solemnly engaged &quot; the lives, the treasure and the sacred honor &quot;of American Catholics in the defense of their freedom against aggression. the response of the President was historic: &quot;We shall win this war,&quot; wroteMr. Roosevelt, &quot; and in victory we shall seek not vengeance but the establishmentof an international order in which the spirit of Christ shall rule the hearts ofmen and of nations.&quot;The same unity based on high purpose pervades all the people of the UnitedStates. Contrary to Axis propaganda claims, the vast majority of our people are responsive to Christian inspiration, even though many may not be practicalchurch-goers. The Axis charge that there are sixty million atheists in theUnited States is sheer nonsense a perversion of statistics on church membership and attendance by which the persecutors of religion are trying to use the churchfor their own sinister purposes.It would be equally misleading for outsiders to be influenced by Axispropaganda about political differences in the United States. We are a democracyand even in war time we insist upon our political freedom. Members of the democratic and Republican political parties are even now contending for manypublic offices, and no one, whatever his position or power, can or will force people to vote in any predetermined manner. We glory in that freedom. It is apractical demonstration of the liberty we are fighting to preserve. But let itbe remembered that in these political contests no candidate would have the slightest chance of election unless he declared himself to be whole-heartedly infavor of the national war effort. Only recently, the whole country applaudedthe court prosecution and punishment of certain men who had tried to sabotageour national unity. In fact, any individual or group who would presume to goagainst that unity or suggest compromise with the enemy would invite theodium of his fellow citizens, would be thoroughly discredited as a patrioticAmerican and would forever disqualify himself from any further role in nationalaffairs.Finally, our certainty of victory is based upon military considerations. the justice of our cause and the unbreakable unity of our people are supported nowby a growing military establishment which, when it reaches its peak, as shortlyit will, cannot be withstood. Germany has already lost heavily in men and inmaterial; her war industry and her. reservoir of man-power have been tappedto the utmost. She still has to face an England with forces intact, fully mobilisedand in crescendo. Above all, she still has to face America. With 4,500,000men under arms, we have not yet called but a small part of our man-power.And the youth of America knows machines. Our production of the engines ofthe war has already surpassed the forecast of the President which but a fewmonths ago seemed fantastic. Our shipyards are producing ocean-going ships for combat and commerce at a rate hitherto undreamed of. The entire industry of the world&apos;s greatest industrial nation is now directed to one only objective to manufacture, by mass production methods in which we excel, the implements of war. We (have only begun and yet we have already surpassed the arms outputof Germany at her peak. The world has never seen such an avalanche of warweapons, manned by skilled mechanics and stout-hearted freemen,-as we shallloose in 1943 and 1944 against the Axis. In some few sectors, we have already taken the offensive, months ahead of our original plans. That offensive will risein irresistible crescendo, more and more rapidly, more and more powerfully,until totalitarianism, with its menace to religion and freedom, is finally andutterly crushed.[24486] B 2
The Axis knows this, knows that its ill-gotten gains cannot be held by continuing the war. What they won through treacherous war, they may now try to retain by a treacherous peace. They timed this war to begin when they were at the zenith of their strength, and when the freedom and peace-loving nationswere unprepared. Their plans have miscarried; now, we have reason to believe,they are casting about for someone to make a peace proposal which will enablethem to escape the inexorable results of defeat in the field. It is the first sign ofa break in Nazi confidence; their peace offensive is a confession of weakness.We Americans are new at world politics. Our geographical position in thepast isolated us from Europe and the other continents. Modern communicationshave forced us from our isolation into world affairs. We are learning. One ofthe first lessons we have grasped is this : that cunningly timed and craftilyplanned peace proposals may be used by faithless aggressors as instruments ofwar. A peace move may be a snare; for the Nazis, it has always been a part ofmilitary strategy. Their record in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and else-where is too recent to be forgotten. Japan talked peace to us at Washingtonwhile she was preparing and consummating the treachery of Pearl Harbour.Thus world experience of Axis &quot; peace &quot; has been bitter. In our case it has alsobeen salutary. Since the Nazis, conscious of their waning power, are likely tobe searching for an intermediary to put forth peace-feelers, it is well that thosewhom we trust should know in advance the position of the United States Govern-ment on any tentative proposal from such a source : we shall not be led away fromprinciple by any stop-gap peace. Our Christian ideals, as well as our nationalexistence, would be in jeopardy if we consented to forgo now our manifestadvantages. An indecisive peace would be a partial victory for the Axis, andwould lead later to a resumption of the conflict under conditions which might be disadvantageous to us and what we stand for. We want none of it. We willhave nothing of an armed truce which would be a breathing space for the enemiesof Christian civilization. We will not permit Axis grand strategy, which includes.in its arsenal the hypocrisy of false peace, to hold the initiative in theconduct&quot; of this war. We have determined that we cannot deal with faithlessmen; that &quot;the peaceful ways of diplomacy have utterly failed against Axisduplicity, ruthlessness and insensibility to all moral considerations. This is no time for a recourse to diplomacy. Having made every effort to avoid this war,we shall not now be weakened by Axis cunning when we have taken the field.We consider that Axis-inspired proposals of &apos;&apos; peace &apos;&apos; would be nothing lessthan a blow aimed at us.There is reason to believe that our Axis enemies will attempt, throughdevious channels, to urge the Holy See to endorse in the near future proposalsof peace without victory. In the present position of the belligerents, we canreadily understand how strong a pressure the Axis Powers may bring to bear upon the Vatican. We therefore feel it a duty to support, the Holy See in resisting any undue pressure from this source. It is for this reason that we feelimpelled to make known our views on the subject of peace, and to point out thatthe growing power of the United States is now being applied to re-establishthose principles of international decency and justice which have been so wellexpounded by the Holy See. We are not so close geographically to the Vaticanas some of our enemies, nor are we in a position to enjoy as many of the indirectday-to-day contacts as they. None the less, we have the fullest confidence thatdue weight will be given to the considerations advanced by a nation whichnumbers among its citizens so many millions of devout Catholics, and whoseGovernment is in such close agreement with the principles enunciated by the holy See on the issues of this war and the kind of peace which must follow it.The people of the United States have a deep and sympathetic unstanding of the Holy Father&apos;s desires for peace as he looks out upon a world convulsedwith the harrowing spectacle of death and destruction on every side. the promotion of world peace, we know, is one of the great functions of the HolySee. Though deferred, that peace will come not a specious peace of strategy,nor a short-lived peace of compromise. It will be the peace of &quot; justice andcharity &quot; for which the Holy Father has so often prayed; it will be the peace&quot; in which the spirit of Christ will rule the hearts of men and of nations &quot; aspromised by the President of the United States. The United States and its allies will win that peace. And in its consolidation, we should want nothing better thana continuation of those parallel efforts made by the Pope and the President beforethe war became general. In such a continuation, so devoutly to be hoped for,much can be accomplished to ensure that the peace will be lasting.
The war aims of the United States are peace aims. The world knows them.The Atlantic Charter lays down conditions which in our deepest conviction areirreducible. Any proposal under the plausible title of a &quot; negotiated peace,&quot;which falls short of these aims, would only tend to confuse issues which we are determined to keep clear and to decide definitely.With renewed assurances of esteem and respect, I offer the foregoing in thehope that they may be helpful in furthering the cause to which our nation hasdedicated itself.MYRON C. TAYLOR,The Personal Representative of thePresident of the United States ofAmerica   to   His   Holiness   PopeSeptember 19, 1942. Pms XILANNEX  .Memorandum on the Church in Russia.Mr. Taylor, Lisbon, October 2. 1942.IN response to your request, I am submitting the following observations withrespect to religion in Russia and its relation to the present situation.These are my own personal views. I do not know to what extent theycoincide with those of my colleagues in the Department of State, whose informa-tion is more up-to-date and whose opinions should bear more authority.The conditions under which the early Communists fought their way to power in Russia made it necessary for them to claim the full spiritual devotion of theirown followers. This caused them to see in the Church not only a stronghold of conservative feeling, and therefore a political opponent, but also a spiritual rival.As a result of this, they entered into power in violent opposition to theRussian Orthodox Church. In the course of a few years they were entirelysuccessful in smashing the Church&apos;s economic position, its organisation, theindependence of its leadership, and, to a very great extent, its spiritualauthority, particularly among the youth of the country.The outwardly moderate provisions of the Soviet. Constitution, which waspromulgated some six years ago, have been rendered largely ineffective by therestrictions placed on religious education and by the predominant role played inthe Soviet system by the Russian Communist Party and the Communistic Leagueof Youth, with their subsidiary organisations. Participation in these organisa-tions remained practically irreconcilable with the public profession of religion;and without participation in such organizations the individual had very fewchances of advancing his own interests in any field of Soviet life.In addition to its open opposition to the Christian Church, the regimedid all in its power to build Communist ideology into something like a competingreligious life in its own right, with similar requirements of spiritual devotionand even of public profession in ceremony and symbol.That this latter effort could not be successful that Christian faith could notbe adequately replaced by a materialistic economic doctrine which had no answers to the problems of suffering and death is obvious to all of us who have beenbrought up in a Christian atmosphere.When, consequently, the Germans began to occupy large portions of Sovietterritory, they found a genuine hunger for religious experience in large parts ofthe Russian population. The Nazis have been exploiting this situation for theirown purposes with characteristic cynicism and, I am afraid, with some success.While they have been careful not to give the religious element in Germany anyindirect support by permitting them to take part in the restoration of religion inthe occupied areas of Russia, they themselves claim to have reopened churcheson a large-scale and to have encouraged a &quot;great resurgence &quot; of religious lifeamong the people. Reports from German correspondents in the East to the Nazi-controlled newspapers in Germany last winter described striking manifestationsof religious enthusiasm in the occupied territories, which if not actuallyencouraged were certainly not being opposed by the German authorities. It was said that in the city of Pskov, for example, where there had been some 40 activechurches in 1918, the Germans found no priests left in the city at all, but thatthey promptly imported two priests from the Russian Orthodox Church in Riga
to take charge of religious life, that the great Cathedral was reopened in timefor the Russian Christmas in January, and that on Christmas Eve not only wasthe Cathedral packed with worshippers, but that thousands of people stood inthe square outside in 30 degrees of frost to participate in the service. Otherstories are told of how untrained laymen, in some cases even old women, conductedservices informally in railway stations and other premises at their disposal, and how people flocked to these meetings. These tales, however much truth theremay be in them, are naturally not without their effect on the religious populations of the other eastern European countries. They doubtless tend to increase thehorror with which these people view the prospect of Russian occupation afterthe war, and to reconcile them to the hardships of German rule at the moment.It should, in these circumstances, be evident to anyone that a greater realtolerance of religious life in Soviet-controlled territories would be in the interestsof the Soviet Government itself, both now and in the future. Possibly, an appreciation of this fact is already present in the minds of the Soviet leaders,and is finding expression in the reported present relaxation in their hostilitytoward relgion. 1Undoubtedly when this war is over, understanding and co-operation in the religious field would present one of the best means of bridging the psychologicalgulf which two decades of Communist education and intellectual isolation have created between the present mature generation of Russia and the countries of the outside world.It would be idle, however, to underestimate the difficulties of achieving suchco-operation and understanding. It would be possible only if it could be proved to the Soviet leaders that religion need no longer constitute a challenge to their political authority. Of this they will not be easily convinced. Tney are extremelysuspicious of all suggestions from foreign quarters, and fearful as Russianrulers have always been of foreign influence of any sort on the Russian popularmind. Just as in the 15th and 16th centuries the Czars of Russia fought Romanreligious influence, not so much out of convictions of dogma as out of fear offoreign influence on a backAvard and credulous people, so the present rulers tendto feel that any foreign influence, religious or otherwise, challenges the securityof their rule.If these preoccupations could be overcome and if the Kremlin could be induced to tolerate religion at home and to receive the proffered co-operation of western religious movements in the spirit of friendliness and confidence, I believeone of the greatest barriers to a sound future peace would have been removed.GEORGE KENNAN.ANNEX C.Strictly Personal Memorandum giving Summary of Considerations expressed byMgr. Tardini in Conversation with Mr. Myron Taylor.THERE is no indication that any of the numerous churches closed to thefaithful in past years have been reopened, nor that high taxes, imposed for theexercise of public worship on those few churches which have remained open,have been reduced. Father Leopold Braun, Rector of the only Catholic Churchin Moscow, writes : &quot; There is talk of a reopening (of the churches), but I haveno certain proof.&quot;2. Nor is there any indication that any priest, who is a Russian citizen,has been freed from prison or from the sentence of deportation to which he hadbeen previously condemned.According to latest available statistics, it would seem that there are stillapproximately one hundred Catholic priests of the Archdiocese of Mohilewdetained in prison or in concentration camps.3. For more than a year now there has been no news of His ExcellencyM. Edward Profittlich, Titular Archbishop of Aclrianopli and ApostolicAdministrator of Estonia. Archbishop Profittlich, a citizen of Estonia, was arrested at Tallinn, the 28th June, 1941, and deported, to the Urals, probably to Kasan.
4. Communists in Albania and Montenegro were recently found to be inpossession of &quot; instructions &quot; from Moscow recommending that they &quot;cultivatethe division between the various religions and direct their attack particularlyagainst the Catholicism.&quot;5. Father Braun has pointed out that the organisation of the militantRussian atheists ceased some time ago to be active, and that, furthermore, officialanti-religious publications are no longer printed; but he noted that copies ofsome such publications are still on sale.Father Braun has also communicated that excerpts from Russian authors&quot; inspired by lofty patriotic sentiments &quot; have been broadcast from Moscow, andin official newspapers (Pravdu and Izcestiya) certain references to religiouspractices have been published.These few simple facts, like the content of the newspapers (whichFather Braun has forwarded and which have been closely scrutinized), may be explained easily in the light of the circumstances of. the present stage of war,without supposing a change in the general programme of Communism withregard to religion.September 26, 1942.ANNEX D.Memorandum from Count Dalla Torre, director of the Osservatore Romano,Vatican City.The anti-Fascist opposition consists of four groups : I. Politicians (former Secretaries of State,  Members of Parliament,Senators); (a) Liberals; (b) Popolari (Christian Democrats); (c) Socialreformers  (like  Bonomi,  former  President of  Cabinet   Council);(d) Socialists.II. Generals, like Badoglio, Cavigiia.III. Writers, professors, members of Liberal or Catholic aristocracy, likePrince Doria-Panfili; Duca T. Gallarati Scotti, Conte ViscontiVenesta, Conte Iacini Stefano, Conte Casati, Alberto Albertini,B. Croce, De Ruggero, Calogero, Parri, Calamandrei, Carneluti,Salvatorelli, Brecchi, Galletti, La Pira. Some of these are in prison,like Calogero and Parri.IV. Communists.   It is very difficult to estimate the real forces of theCommunist party; their chiefs and organisers are confined on the island of Ventotene, near Ponza (population about 2,000), whencethey keep in touch secretly with their partisans. Many infiltrationsare noted in the war factories.After the breakdown of fascism, the constitution of a stable Government,based on the solidarity of I (a), (b), (c), and perhaps (d), II and III, with theco-operation of the American emigrants (like Sforza and Sturzo) is possible, on condition that this Government is able to save money and to preserve Italy fromessential mutilations. Such a Government will certainly find the support of themembers of the very strong Catholic Associations, of the Liberal intellectualyouth, of the bureaucracy and of many business men. However, the manifesta-tion of Montevideo and the nomination of Pacciardi to be chief of the ItalianLegion (Pacciardi was already a member of the Partito Repubblicano Italiano)aaused in the quarters of the opposition some perplexity. The politicians sub I.and III are not all and not unconditionally for the monarchy, but many consideran intervention of the dynasty would facilitate the solution of the crisis(traditions of the carabinieri) and avoid the advent of Communists. Every effort must be made they say to win over the Prince, and it is reported that the princess Mary seeks to get into contact with the aristocrats of the opposition.Concerning the future chief of the Government, it is true that the dictator-ship blocked the way to the development of great personalities, but there are stillformer presidents of Cabinet Council and leaders of former parties or generalswho.have the qualities and capacity to preside at least for a first period over theunited forces of anti-fascism.
