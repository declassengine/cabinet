(42) 434.September 29, 1942.WAR CABINET.THE WORKING OF THE COMBINED BOARDS.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.I THINK the time has come to review the operation of the combinedmachinery which has been set up in Washington in the course of this year. Inthat part of the field with which I am concerned, namely, raw materials, pro-duction and the assignment of munitions, the progress made is far fromencouraging. It may be that in our dealings with. a country in which highlyindividualistic views are prevalent we have expected too much from organisa-tions whose working depends upon co-operative give-and-take. Nevertheless, Ithink the time is ripe for a new impulse to be given to the machine.2. As a result of the Prime Minister&apos;s visit to Washington in December and January last, four Combined Agencies were set up^ viz., the Combined Chiefs ofStaff; the Combined Shipping Adjustment Board; the Combined MunitionsAssignment Board; and the Combined Raw Materials Board.I am only directly concerned with the two latter. But I must point out thatthe smooth and effective working of the Combined Chiefs of Staff is vital to thewhole machine, since it is the function of all the other Combined Agencies tohelp to bring to a successful conclusion the strategy which the Combined Chiefsof Staff lay down.   I shall revert to this point later.bMunitions Assignments Boards.3. The Munitions Assignments Boards made a good start in tackling theproblem of dividing up, on a short-term basis, the combined output of finished munitions. The method of operation of the Board in Washington, however, can hardly be said to fulfil the spirit of the agreement by which it was set up, namely,that assignments should be in accordance with strategic needs. For example, the assignment of Army equipment produced in the United States is controlled almostentirely by the views of the United States War Department, whose primaryconcern is to build, up a vast American Army. Assignments for the BritishEmpire can only be secured by putting forward claims substantiated to the lastdetail, whereas the United States claim for the remainder is put forward on thegeneral proposition that the material is all needed for the Army, without regardto holdings or operational requirements. Fortunately, the ouput in the UnitedStates of many of the essential types of Army equipment, such as tanks, has been so large that our interests have not suffered unduly.    .4. The picture is very different, however, in the case of aircraft. It is notpossible to make assignments of aircraft on a short-term basis, and consequentlyvarious agreements, covering six months or a year ahead, have been entered intobetween the British Air Staff and the United. States Army Air Corps. Thefirst of these, the so-called Arnold-Slessor Agreement, was made long before theUnited States came into the war. This was very quickly departed from by the americans, who stated that they never recognised the Agreement as binding.This was followed by the Arnold-Portal Agreement, which was arranged during-the Prime Minister&apos;s visit last January. This was broken by the Americansalmost as soon as it was made. It was followed, in turn., by the Arnold-Portal-Towers Agreement, signed during the Prime Minister&apos;s visit to Washington in[24395] . b
June, and initialled by the President and the Prime Minister. This has alreadybeen broken by the Americans in various particulars, examples of which arein Annex I.5. It is unquestionable that the assignment machinery is operated by the americans in a unilateral manner. As they become more deeply involved inthe war, the tendency is for their attitude to harden. Even in the case of itemswhere production will be on an increasingly stupendous scale, we will be hardput to it to secure our share of the common pool.Raw Materials Board.6. The Combined Raw Materials Board has made a good start. Its two maintasks have been, first, to secure the reduction of less essential requirements in boththe United States and the British Empire so as to ensure supplies for essential requirements : and, secondly, to allocate short supply raw materials between thevarious countries.7. From the point of view of securing for British countries a fair and proper share of raw materials (including those where marginal supplies are under united States control) the Combined Raw Materials Board has hitherto workedsmoothly and effectively more so, indeed, than could reasonably be expected inview of the alarm which the United States authorities, and especially the UnitedStates Service Departments, have been showing for some time about the rawmaterial position. A satisfactory technique for showing up clearly andunimpeachably the supply and requirement positions for each raw material asfar as British countries are concerned has gradually been worked out and agreed between the British and American sections of the Combined Secretariat of the combined Raw Materials Board in Washington, and this technique has stoodus in good stead. The British have had hard figures and rigid control methods to oppose to the more speculative figures and much more ineffective controls atthe disposal of the Americans.8. Even so, the British countries are in for a difficult period in connectionwith the raw materials where marginal supplies are under American control.Much will depend on the success achieved by the Combined Production and resources Board in their task of reducing the excessive demands of the UnitedStates Service Departments, which tend to create . an artificial raw materialsshortage (see paragraph 13 below).Combined Production and Resources Board.9. In June of this year I visted Washington with the objects set forth inmy previous Report (W.P. (42) 268^ The most important of these was to securethe rightful position of the British Production Programme in a combined Anglo-American Programme designed to fulfil the requirements of strategy. If this could be achieved, the production of raw materials and components vital to theBritish Production Programme would take place as part of an agreed plan, andno longer as a result of negotiations on each individual point, based on thestatement of a British deficiency. Unilateral decisions to cut down supplies forus would no longer be made. To achieve this object I proposed the setting upof the Combined Production and Resources Board. It seemed, at the end of my visit, that there was general recognition in Washington that the object I had inview was worth attaining, and that the machinery which was then initiated wouldbe in a position to ensure its realisation. The Directive issued by the president and the Prime Minister gave as the duty of the Combined Production and resources Board the combining of the production programmes of the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom into a single integrated programme, adjusted tothe strategic requirements of the war as indicated by the Combined Chiefsof Staff.10. Mr. Nelson and I were convinced, from our knowledge of the possi-bilities of production both in the United States and in the United Kingdom^that unless the combined requirements first for 1942, and then for 1943, were set at a level realistically adjusted to the needs of the theatres of war, the combined Chiefs of Staff would find, when they wished to put their plans intooperation in these years, that the equipment they most wanted would not beavailable in sufficient quantity because of the waste of resources which wouldhave taken place in an attempt to provide the maximum of everything. we accordingly asked the Combined Chiefs of Staff to prepare, arid furnish to the
Board, a statement of munitions required to be produced by the 31st December,1942, to meet the needs of the forces designed for the Spring of 1943. We askfor a similar statement for the requirements up to the end of 1943. This request was accepted by the Combined Chiefs of Staff, who issued a Directive to theirPlanning Staffs to produce the appropriate Orders of Battle on which require-ments could be calculated.11. By the time the data for the end of 1942 were produced it was alreadytoo late to affect materially the production during that year. The combined production and Resources Board accordingly pressed for the statement of the1943 requirements. It was realised that it would be no easy task to work outthe Combined Order of Battle for the various theatres of war in April 1944,but, nevertheless, it was felt that this task should be attempted so that require-ments for production in 1943 would be related as nearly as possible to operationalneeds, and should not be simply worked out on the war establishment of theforces which the United Nations proposed to raise. The British part of the Orderof Battle has been worked out, and transmitted to Washington. It has also beentranslated into terms of actual requirements of munitions of all kinds. Wehave now been informed, however, by the United States Chiefs of Staff, that theydo not consider it possible to work out their part of the Order of Battle, andthat they propose to calculate their requirements on the following basis :-(a) Total forces which can be transported and maintained in trans-oceanictheatres based on forecast of available shipping and escorts.(&amp;) Total United States forces required for defence of Western Hemisphere,. in training, or for use as strategic reserves.The latter gives a blank cheque to the United States War Department to setout the requirements of whatever Army they propose to raise in the United States.12. The matter is complicated by the Presidential Directives which, onthe one hand, lay down the size of the forces, and, on the other hand, have setindustrial objectives for the various years in terms of the principal weapons objectives which are quite unrelated to operational requirements. For example,it is believed that the President has authorised the raising of an Army of morethan 6^ million men, though it is obvious that only a small proportion of this number could be shipped abroad in measurable time. The President also set an objective of 75,000 tanks for 1943. In an effort to reach this objective, the americans are proposing to manufacture in that year no less than 45,000 medium and heavy tanks and 31.000 light tanks. These, with our own production of11,000 of alb types, make a total of about 87,000 tanks, or sufficient to providefor some 200 Armoured Divisions with 100 per cent, reserves. ^13. This illustration, together with others set out in Annex II. demonstratesthat in 1943 there will be a tremendous waste of effort in the United States, muchof which, if decisions could be taken now, could be diverted into productivechannels, e.g., ships or aircraft. Another effect of these inflated figures is thata very large percentage -of the American effort at the present moment is going into the construction of new industrial capacity, much of which could well be heldover to a later date. The resultant demands on raw materials are creatingartificial shortages, which react unfavourably on the vital parts of both the Britishand the American programmes.14. While having met with little success in its main task of shaping a combined production programme to meet real strategic needs, the C.P.R.B. hasdevoted considerable time to adjusting individual items and to investigationsinto supply and demand of critical raw materials. In this field useful work hasbeen done.15. Our task remains the same as it has been all through the period sincethe United States came into the war, namely (a) To try to direct the vast energies of the American production machineinto the right channels.(b) To ensure that the forces in contact with the enemy are not deprived oftheir requirements in order to supply on too large a scale what may becalled secondary needs. Since at present and for some time to comea high proportion of those forces are British, we must not allow their needs to take second place.16. Much of our difficulty in trying to secure these objects springs from the peculiar organisation and the individualistic outlook of the Government and its[24395] . * b2
constituent parts in the United States. Mr. Nelson is well aware of the short-comings of the present American system, and there are indications that, so faras lies in his power, he is preparing the ground for something better. First, hehas appointed Mr. Charles Wilson, the Chairman of the General ElectricCompany, to be Chairman of a Committee, with representatives of the maritime commission and of the Service Supply Departments. This Committee willoversee the execution of the supply programmes. Secondly, he has madeMr. Ferdinand Eberstadt, the pi-esent head of the Army and Navy MunitionsBoard, entirely responsible for the provision of raw materials to meet require-ments. Mr. Wilson and Mr. Eberstadt become vice-chairmen of the war production Board.- 17. Though these moves should prove helpful, the fact remains that the americans have never been accustomed, in consideration of military or quasi-military matters, to link harmoniously the civil and the military interests. Theyhave no War Cabinet and they have no Defence Committee at which require-ments, both civil and military, can be scrutinised and programmes framed with due regard to the merits of &quot;the case. Nor have they any means by which the conflicting views of the several agencies can be harmonised and a common policyreached. The whole burden of curbing the extravagant demands of the war department and of co-ordinating the action of the many agencies that have been created falls on one man the President.18. It is obviously impossible for us to alter the American system. through our many contacts in the combined bodies we can exert a certain influence, butthere is a point beyond which this influence is ineffective. If we see a situation,as I think we do now, in which great harm to the Allied cause will result unlessremedial measures are taken, we have no course open to us but to approach thePresident and hope that he will bring the necessary pressure to bear.19. It remains to consider what form the approach to the President shouldtake.   The choice before us seems to lie between the following two courses :  (a) We could reiterate to the President the importance and urgency of thepreparation by the Combined Chiefs of Staff, and the agencies under their control, of a statement of requirements directly related tostrategic needs, and urge him to order its preparation;or (&amp;) We could draw the Presidents attention to specific examples, such asthe Tank and Ammunition production programmes, where there willbe an inexcusable waste of resources in 1943, and leave it to thePresident to devise the remedy in the shape which he judges to be most suitable.20. It so happens that the Combined Production and Resources Board has just prepared a progress Report at the request of the President. The mainfeature of this report is an exposition of the need for a statement of requirementsdirectly related to strategic needs. I tlhink it would be injudicious for thePrime Minister to put to the President an appeal couched in almost the samelanguage. The Progress Report, however, provides a convenient peg on which to hang an approach from the Prime Minister to the President on the lines ofthe second alternative. This is the course of action which I recommend shouldbe adopted, and at Annex III is a draft which I suggest might furnish the basis for the Prime Minister&apos;s telegram.O. L.Great George Street, S.W.1,September 29, 1942.
ANNEX I.Non-fulfiment of the Arnold-Towers-Portal Air Agreement, initialled by thePresident and the Prime Minister in Washington on June 22, 1942.THE main failure on the part of the United States to fulfil thisagreement is in the light bomber class, of which approximately 50 per cent, only of the allocations promised from June to September 1942, inclusive, have beenprovided.   The actual deficiencies are as followsHudsonBaltimoreBostonVengeanceBermudaThere has also been a deficiency in one type of fighter, namelyMustang601641076917631It is understood that these failures have been mainly caused by a lag in Americanproduction which has been passed on to us pro rata. It should be noted that,whereas deliveries under the Russian protocol are not affected by any failure in production, we have not been accorded such favourable treatment.2. Under the agreement, the United States undertook to establish ready for operations in certain theatres of war specific numbers of air units. In the middle east one pursuit group was to be established by the 1st September, 1942, and afurther one by the 1st October, 1942. The latter has not been made available andis unlikely to be in operation until December or January and there seems at themoment to be no chance whatever of the full four fighter groups agreed uponbeing in the Middle East by the New Year.ANNEX II.Bwamples of United States Production Plans.-30&quot; Calibre Ball Ammunition.THE Americans have planned to produce 10,000 million rounds of thisammunition in 1943. This number is over and above the large quantity oftracer, A.P. and incendiary ammunition of the same calibre which they will produce.2. The total expenditure of -303&quot; ball S.A.A. in the Middle East sincethe beginning of the war to the present date is slightly over 200 million rounds.This includes losses in Greece and elsewhere and losses at sea en route. Inthe last war the total expenditure of the American Expeditionary Force inFrance was of the order of 1,000 million rounds of ball ammunition.3. This enormous programme of ball ammunition springs largely from aninflated idea of expenditure rates which have been calculated by their war department, apparently without any attention to the experience of three yearsof war. For example; a certain American task force of approximately ninedivisions in all has been issued as initial equipment with over 400 millionrounds of -30&quot; calibre S.A.A., which is nearly 100 million rounds more than ourentire holding in the Middle East.4. In 1944 the Americans have put their requirements at no less than 20.000million rounds of -30&quot; calibre ball ammunition. Plans for other calibres are on a correspondingly stupendous scale.Aircraft Bombs.5. The United States production programme for 1943 of H.E. and A.P.aerial bombs totals 2,200,000 tons or an average of over 180,000 tons a month.This programme is seven times as large as our own. The maximum weightof bombs dropped by Bomber Command in any one month up to the presenthas been less than 7,000 tons.   There will of course be a very great expansion
of the Anglo-American bomber effort all over the world, but the provision of bombs in 1943 assumes a rate of expansion which cannot possibly be attained inthat year.Merchant Vessels.6. The Presidents objective for United States merchant shipbuilding for1942 and 1943 is 24 million tons dead weight. If all shipbuilding facilities in theUnited States were fully developed, it is estimated that an output of 28 million tons would be possible. The allocation of steel at present being made is unlikely to enable even the lower figure to be attained. The completion of a shipyard was recently stopped, and there appears to be no incentive to exceed the Presidentsobjective at the expense of less vital output.ANNEX III.Proposed Draft Telegram from the Prime Minister to the President.I HAVE been furnished with a copy of the Progress Report which the combined Production and Resources Board have submitted to you in response to your letter of 19th August. I have followed with interest the work of theBoard since its inception in June, and I fully appreciate the importance to thesuccess of their task of integrating the production programmes of the twocountries, of a statement of requirements directly related to strategic needs. I also realise the formidable difficulties which stand in the way of the preparationof such a statement for a date so far ahead, as 1st April, 1944. The progress towards the ideal at which the Board is aiming may well be slow.2. In the meanwhile, it seems to me that there are certain features of ourcombined programmes which, if they are allowed to stand unmodified, must leadto a misdirection in 1943 of resources of materials and industrial capacity whichwe can ill afford. I think I can best illustrate my meaning by taking as examplesthe combined production programmes of Tanks and of Ball Ammunition.3. Our combined Tank Programme for 1943 allows for the production in theUnited States of some 31,000 Light Tanks and 45,000 Medium and Heavy TanksIn the United Kingdom, the production will be 11,000 of all types. The totalamounts to some 87,000 tanks, which I am advised would be sufficient to equipsome 200 Armoured Divisions with 100 per cent, reserves. This appears to me tobe a provision on a scale out of all proportion to anything that might be broughtto bear on the enemy in 1943. It was, of course, necessary for us to fix hightargets in the early days, so as to get production moving on a great scale. Havewe not now reached the time when we could, with advantage, scrutinise ourtargets more closely ? In our efforts to reach to too great a height, we may wellexhaust an undue quantity of our resources.4. A further effect of setting the targets of the main items of equipment too high is that everything else is then calculated in proportion. For example, theUnited States production in 1943 of Ball ammunition will be of the order of20,000 million rounds of all calibres. That of the United Kingdom will beof the order of 2,000 million rounds. Observing that the entire expenditure ofBall ammunition by our army in the Middle East, from the beginning of thewar to the present date, is little more than 200 million rounds, and rememberingthat the total expenditure of the American Expeditionary Force in the last war was of the order of 1,000 million rounds, it would appear that we are making provision on a scale which is altogether too lavish.5. I am bringing these matters to your attention because of my anxiety that,if inflated demands are given full rein, we shall Create for ourselves unnecessarydifficulties in the provision of raw materials and industrial capacity, and. shallbe unnecessarily curtailing our power to expand the production of such vitalrequirements as escort vessels, ships, and aircraft, of Avhich it is almost impossibleto have too many.6. I am ready to co-operate in any way you may- think desirable inscrutinising our programmes, so as to rectify those anomalies which may exist,and so as to ensure that our combined resources will be used, to the best advantage.
