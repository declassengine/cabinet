naval SITUATION.General Review.1.   Twenty-seven ships of the convoy to Russia have arrived at Archangel.A convoy from Russia has reached Home Waters with the loss of four ships and two of the escorting vessels sunk by U-boats.A number of attacks on enemy shipping have been reported by our submarines in the Mediterranean.Two U-boats have been sunk.Shipping losses, chiefly due to U-boat attacks, have been lighter than of late.Home Waters and North Atlantic.2. In an attack on Dartmouth by enemy aircraft on the 18th, H.M.Minesweeper Selkirk was slightly damaged and a collier and two lighters were sunk.H.M. Armed Boarding Vessel A louette was torpedoed and sunk early onthe 19th south-west of Lisbon.   Twenty-seven of the crew were rescued.During the week some 18,000 tons of enemy merchant shipping was sunk or seriously damaged by our aircraft.Northern Waters.3. Twenty-seven ships of the convoy to Russia arrived at Archangel onthe 21st.In view of the importance of this operation the following detailed accountof the passage of this convoy has been extracted from a signal from the senior Naval Officer in charge Of the escort :-4. A promising attack was carried out on a U-boat on the 9th, after whichthe convoy was continuously shadowed by enemy aircraft and U-boats. On the12th several attacks were made on U-boats, including a very promising one byH.M. Destroyer Faulknor.5. On the 13th two ships were torpedoed by U-boats. Minelaying by enemy aircraft was carried out ahead of the convoy without any effect. On thesame day the first air attack took place in the form of high-level bombing byabout six Ju. 88&apos;s, which came through gaps in the clouds. There were no casualties on either side. The second attack was made by between 40 and50 torpedo bombers. Despite intense fire by all ships the attack was mostcourageously pressed home to very short range and resulted in eight merchant ships being sunk. Five enemy aircraft were seen to crash, many others damaged.The third attack was by nine torpedo bombers, which were driven off bythe destroyers&apos; gunfire, resulting in torpedoes being dropped at long range welloutside the screen. Two bombers were seen to crash. One Hurricane which attacked a shadowing He. 115 was shot down in flames. There was furtherminelaying by a large number of enemy aircraft ahead of the convoy, againwithout result., The fourth attack was at dusk by twelve torpedo bombers and was again frustrated by gunfire of the destroyer screen and H.M.S. Avenger&apos;s fighters.Six enemy aircraft were seen to crash.6. On the 14th the R.F.A. tanker A theltemplar was torpedoed by a U-boat and subsequently sunk by our forces.Swordfish sighted a U-boat six miles distant. After H.M. Destroyer Onslowhad carried out an attack, oil, air bubbles and wreckage were reported.The fifth attack was in the early afternoon by 22 torpedo bombers and was pressed home, but no ships were hit. H.M. ships Avenger and Scylla were the chieftargets. The sixth attack, by twelve Ju. 88&apos;s, closely followed. This consisted of high-level bombing lasting about one and a half hours and, although several ships of the escort had near misses, no damage was done. The seventh attack was by 25 torpedo bombers from right ahead. The attack split and passed on either side of H.M.S. Scylla. One merchant ship was hit and blew up. The explosiondamaged the ship next astern and destroyed two torpedo bombers. ThreeHurricanes were shot down but all the pilots were rescued. Our Hurricane pilotsshowed great gallantry in their determination to get in amongst the enemy,despite the solid mass of our defensive fire. In the eighth attack by Ju. 88&apos;sthrough clouds there were few opportunities for defensive fire and heavy bombs were dropped close to H.M. ships Scylla, Avenger and escorts, which appearedto be the chief target.
From detailed analysis 24 enemy aircraft were seen to crash during attacks on the 14th.H.M.S. Avenger sighted 17 torpedoes, and her pilots claim five enemy aircraftcertainly destroyed, three probable and 14 damaged.7. On the 15th 443 survivors of ships sunk were transferred to ships of the convoy force, but 24 Russian survivors and 11 British cot cases were left in therescue ship.In the ninth attack high and low level bombing were experienced for threehours, 50-70 aircraft taking part and attacking mainly from above low clouds.The enemy was harassed by our Hurricanes above the clouds and. by intensegunfire by escorts whenever they appeared below. Many bombs were dropped,including some very heavy ones.   One bomber was seen to crash.There were many U-boat hunts during the day, which included a promisingattack by H.M. Destroyer Impulsive.8. An attack by high level and torpedo bombers was made on the 18th whenoff Cape Kanin. One ship was sunk, but at least four enemy aircraft were destroyed. The convoy was again attacked by 24 Ju. 88s on the 20th whenweatherbound on the Dvina bar. This attack was driven off and two enemy aircraft were destroyed.9. Preliminary figures show that the enemy lost 38 aircraft in the attacks,during the passage of the convoy, and many others were probably damaged.Promising attacks were made on four U-boats. The R.F.A. Atheltemplar(8,992 tons) and 12 other ships totalling 65,419 tons were lost. Of the latter six were United States, three British, two Russian and.one Panamanian.10. Fourteen ships of a homeward bound convoy which left Archangel onthe 13th have reached Home Waters.11. On the 18th shadowing aircraft appeared for a short time and severalicebergs were sighted.12. On the 19th two ships of the convoy were unsuccessfully attacked by -boats. During the night numerous attacks were made on U-boats, and early onthe 20th H.M. Minesweeper Leda in the rear of the convoy was torpedoed and sunk. A Swordfish and H.M. Destroyer Aslianti both report very promisingattacks on U-boats which continued to shadow the convoy throughout theremainder of its passage. One ship was hit by two torpedoes, and H.M. DestroyerSomali was hit in the engine room and subsequently sank after being towed forthree days by Ashanti.13. On the 21st H.M. Ships Bramble and Worcester carried out a promisingattack on a U-boat. A Catalina was shot down while attacking a U-boat.14. On the 22nd the R.F.A. Gray Ranger (3,313 tons) and two merchant ships were torpedoed and sunk.   The rescue ship picked up 280 survivors.Mediterranean.15. H.M. Submarines have reported the following attacks : Traveller sank a heavily laden ship off Derna on the 5th and claimed to have torpedoed anothervessel of 3,000 tons. P. 44 sank two small ships in Ziliten Roads (east ofTripoli (L)) on the 17th. Two schooners were sunk and others damaged by. 212 alongside the wharves at Buggerru (West coast of Sardinia). Thrashertorpedoed a 5,000-ton southbound ship off Tobruk, and P. 46 torpedoed one ship of 3,000 tons and one of 5,000 tons in the Gulf of Hammamet on the 22nd. all three ships are believed to have sunk.16. H.M. Submarine Talisman on passage to Malta is overdue and must be presumed lost.17. During the week 19,292 tons of French merchant shipping westboundand 20,814 tons eastbound passed Gibraltar under escort.East Indies.18. The Vichy French s.s. Marechal Gallieni (1,559 tons) was intercepted by H.M. Destroyer Nizam east of Lourenzo Marques, after being sightedSouth African aircraft, and is being escorted to Durban.[24394] b 2
Pacific.19. U.S.A. submarines have sunk three merchant ships and two largetransports and have also damaged a tanker, all in areas other than the SolomonIslands.20. A Japanese force which included two battleships, an aircraft carrier,three heavy and three light cruisers were sighted east of the Solomons on the 14thand was attacked by U.S.A. aircraft. It is possible that the battleships were hit. In an attack on cruisers and destroyers on the following day U.S.A. aircraftclaim to have torpedoed one cruiser and damaged another by bombs. A cruiserwas reported to have been damaged by dive-bombing north-west of Guadalcanalon the 20th.21. A U.S.A. submarine sank a Japanese heavy cruiser in the BismarckArchipelago.Anti-Submarine Operations.22. H.M. Canadian Minesweeper Georgian sank a U-boat in the st. Lawrence on the 21st. U.S.A. aircraft sank a U-boat south of Ascensionon 17th.In addition, at least four promising attacks have been carried out : by U.S.A.surface craft escorting a convoy in the Caribbean, by aircraft south of the Faroesand in the West Atlantic, and by destroyers and aircraft off Tobago.Enemy Intelligence.German.23. The positions of German main units are substantially unchangedsince last week. It is believed that the Scharnhorst is now working up andthat the Prinz Eugen, with her new stern fitted, is now ready for trials.Italian.24. The 8&quot; cruiser Bolzano has arrived at Naples with damage to thestarboard side, extending from the upper deck to the Waterline, and with onefunnel displaced.The two Cavour class battleships have been exercising during the weekand have now returned to Taranto.There has been an increase during the week of almost 100 per cent, inthe traffic to North Africa, and an increased use of Tripoli (L) has been noted.U-boats.25. Ninety U-boats are estimated to be operating in the Atlantic. activity was greatest to the south-east of Greenland, in the area to the eastward ofTrinidad, in the St. Lawrence River and between Freetown and Ascension Island.A Japanese U-boat has been operating in the Indian Ocean.Protection of Seaborne Trade.26. During the week ending 20th-21st, 1,093 ships have been convoyed.Of these 249 were in ocean convoys and 844 in British coastal convoys. Onecruiser, one auxiliary aircraft carrier, one armed merchant cruiser, four anti-aircraft ships, 93 destroyers (including three United States destroyers), 106 sloops,cutters and corvettes (including three United States cutters) and two submarines were employed on escort duties, which included the two Russian convoys.During the week, 139 ships in five ocean convoys arrived in Home Waterswith the loss of three ships.27. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 19th totalled 910,000 tons compared with 829,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 667,000 tons for the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports 239,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.28. Apart from those ships attacked in the convoys to and from Russia,11 ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boat and of these six, including one tanker, are known to have sunk. ,
Four ships, including two stragglers, from a homeward bound convoy from canada, were torpedoed S.E. of Greenland. Three ships were attacked off thecoast of British Guiana, one off Martinique, two in North-West approaches and one in the Indian Ocean.One ship was sunk by aircraft in Dartmouth harbour.British Minelaying.29. Mines were laid by ships off the Norwegian and French coasts. Aircraftlaid mines in the Baltic, along the German North Sea coast, and in the channel and Bay of Biscay.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.30. Minelaying by E-boats was suspected in the Channel late on the 19th,and a few aircraft may have laid mines off the East Coast on the same night.Aircraft were suspected of minelaying in the -White Sea on the 16th, andArchangel was closed temporarily on the 22nd.Seventeen mines were destroyed during the week. The totals to date are :acoustic 1,317; magnetic 2,634; moored 1,673.Enemy Merchant Shipping.31. Activity has lately been shown by some of the ships which have been running the blockade to and from Biscay Ports. The ex-Dutch s.s. Kota Nopan(7,322 tons), which was seen at St. Nazaire on the 8th, and the Germans.s. Ermland (6,528 tons), which was last seen at Bordeaux, are both reported tohave sailed before the 16th. It is thought that the Kota Nopan may be a supplyship. The German s.s. Rio Grande (6,062 tons), the Italian s.s. Pietro Orseolo(6,344 tons), and the Norwegian s.s Silvaplana (4,793 tons) were all seen atBordeaux on the 16th, when the first two were fully loaded and ready for sea. Onthe same day the German s.s. Burgenland (7,320 tons), which had arrived atBordeaux at the end of July, was seen to be anchored off Le Verdon and a tankerwas in La Pallice Roads.The Italian tankers Albaro (2,104 tons) and Celeno (3,741 tons) have sailed from Istanbul and entered the iEgean on the 15th.vichy French Shipping.32. Reports have been received of German demands for the requisitioning of French shipping, or Allied shipping under Vichy French control.Russian Intelligence.33. Two Russian submarines have been operating in the Gulf of Bothnia,and by the 12th September had claimed to have sunk two Finnish ships andpossibly a third.On the night of 18th/19th a fleet minesweeper bombarded enemy positions in the Novorossisk area. The units of the Black Sea Fleet have also been engagedin transporting troops to that area.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.Northern and Central Sectors.34. The Russians continue to attack locally south of Lake Ladoga and, in greater strength, in the Rzhev area. They have also gone over to the offensiveeast of Orel, though it is not known on what scale. In no case, &quot;however, hasthere been any great territorial change.Don Sector.35. In renewed attacks against the German positions at Voronezh theRussians initially met with some success, though whether they have been aisle
to hold the ground won is not clear. Strong Russian pressure, however, continues.They are also attacking some 50 miles south of Voronezh, where they are estab-lished in unknown strength on the western bank of the Don. The Germans haveregained some little ground east of Yelansk, where the Russians had formed a bridgehead south of the Don, but Russian attempts to extend their footingcontinue.Stalingrad Sector.36. The one clear fact in a confused situation at Stalingrad is that theRussians continue to resist tenaciously. The Germans have penetrated to thecentre of the city, where there is heavy street fighting, but the Russians retain their, hold on the northern suburbs. Outside Stalingrad the Russians arelaunching sustained counter-attacks against the German flanks both from thenorth and, in a lesser degree, from the south. Russian reinforcements continueto arrive in the town, presumably by means of pontoon bridges across the Volga.Caucasus Sector.37. Eastwards of Mozdok, on the northern bank of the River Terek, theGermans have regained ground lost a week earlier. South of Mozdok the germans have enlarged their bridgehead somewhat, but their progress continues to be slow. In the passes of the Western Caucasus range the Germans are at a stand-still, and in some cases the initiative has passed to the Russians, who have beencounter-attacking with success. They still hold the heights round Novorossisk,and thus prevent access to the coastal road, although a German advancesouthwards from the railway Krasnodar-Krimskaya might endanger their position.Summary.38. The prolonged Russian resistance at Stalingrad, which shows no sign of abating, has now made any major German offensive against the main russian armies in the. Central sector extremely unlikely, but there are numerous indica-tions that the Germans are preparing a full-scale attack on Leningrad.If Stalingrad falls, the Germans will doubtless attempt to establish their line along the knver Volga, to Astrakhan and continue their efforts to obtaincontrol of Caucasia and the Black Sea ports. After the middle of October,operations through the Caucasus passes should be impracticable. The germans are, therefore, likely to be faced with another winter in Russia with a muchextended line and the bulk of the Russian Army still in a position to harass themand to keep considerable enemy forces engaged.Egypt and Libya.39.   Patrol activity has continued on both sides during the week.   Enemyworking parties have been encountered and dispersed.   Enemy armoured cars,carried out reconnaissance on the southern flank during the 16th.Our desert forces have carried out successful operations over 500 miles behind the enemy&apos;s front. On the night of the 13th/14th Benghazi and Barce wereraided, over 30 aircraft were damaged or destroyed on the ground, and severalothers have been shot down while attacking our troops. Heavy casualties wereinflicted on enemy personnel and M.T. On the night of the 15th/16th Jalo-Oasis was occupied, and during this operation, which lasted several days,considerable casualties were caused to the enemy garrison. Our artillerydestroyed dumps of ammunition and supplies. Our forces have now arrived backat their bases.Madagascar.40. On the 16th a request was received from the Governor-Generalregarding the possibility of discussing an armistice. This was agreed to. andVichy French delegates arrived by air on the 17th at Majunga. They receivedour terms and refused them, returning to the capital the following day.Meanwhile, our advance on Tananarive had continued steadily, thoughslowly, owing to the large number of obstructions encountered on the&apos; road. a successful engagement was fought 5 miles south of Andriba on the 16th. By the afternoon of the 18th our leading elements had reached a point 90 miles north ofTananarive. Mopping-up operations in the north-west of the Island in the area east of Majunga continued. One of our patrols reached Port Berge during-the 18th.
On the same day combined operations against Tamatave were carried out.After the local Governor had refused our ultimatum to surrender and fired onour envoys whom we sent ashore, British troops were landed following a briefbombardment from the escorting naval vessels. By midday the town was under our control and most of the French garrison had withdrawn by rail to Tananarive.Our forces followed up on the 19th, captured Brickaville and continued the advance on the capital.On the 20th our advance from the north on Tananarive continued andAnkazobe was occupied. The village of Mahitsy, some 20 miles north ofTananarive, was captured on the 22nd after a sharp engagement, and our forcesentered the capital at midday on the 23rd.Operations are proceeding against the French forces retiring to the south ofTananarive.Far East.New Guinea.41. Australian forces have carried out further limited withdrawals, and onthe loth were in contact with the Japanese some 28 miles north-east of port moresby. Activity is confined to patrolling, in which some casualties have beeninflicted on the Japanese. It is estimated that Japanese forces south of the OwenStanley Mountains consist of two regiments.Solomon Islands.42. During the 13th/14th a Japanese counter-attack on the U.S.A.positions on Guadalcanal Island was repulsed, and since that date land activity has been confined to patrolling and skirmishes. The U.S.A. forces in the South-East Solomons have received supplies and reinforcements.According to U.S.A. estimates, the Japanese forces on Guadalcanal Islandtotal 6,000 to 8,000. These comprise troops which fled into the interior after the initial landings, and also small parties which the Japanese have subsequentlysucceeded in landing on the island by night from light naval craft.Intelligence.Disposition of German Divisions.43. There are now believed to be 179 German divisions on the Russian front,34 in France and the Low Countries and 8 in Finland, including the Kirkenesarea of Norway.China.44. Reports have been received of Japanese troop movements north ofKalgan on the main route leading across Outer Mongolia towards Lake Baikalin Siberia. The Japanese are said to have been building up reserves of petrol and water for a long time at Pangkiang (160 miles north-west of Kalgan). Otherreports state that the Japanese have built dumps west of Kalgan along the borderbetween Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan. This route is the most promising for a japanese drive westwards to cut the north-west supply line from Russia to China,should the Japanese consider such a move necessary.New Britain.45. There are now over 35,000 Japanese troops in the Rabaul area,including tanks, cavalry, anti-aircraft and harbour defence artillery. further reinforcements are reported to be en route.AIR SITUATION.General Review.a 45&quot; , ^?^ber Command aircraft attacked Munich, saarbrucken Wismarand shipbuilding yards at Flensburg and Vegesack.Sea-mming in enemy waters was on a large scale.the MeditSranea^^8 &quot;&quot;&quot;^ 0n enemy shiPPinS in Home Waters and in
United Kingdom.^47. Fighter Command flew 745 defensive sorties by day (including 34 by .S.A.A.C. aircraft) and 384 by night.Enemy activity against this country was again on a very small scale. Thirty-one enemy aircraft flew overland by day and 20 by night. Five were destroyed,two were probably destroyed and four were damaged..Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.48. Fighter and Bomber Commands despatched 55 and 33 offensive sorties respectively, compared with 391 and 32 last week.Eighteen Bostons, operating in pairs, were despatched to attack power-stations in Northern France and hits were scored, on six of these targets, one ofwhich was Mazingarbe, where the roof of a boiler or turbine house was blown off.Mosquitos operated against Berlin, the iron and steel works at Ijmuidenand targets in north-west German)7. There was heavy cloud over Berlin and noresults could be seen, but at Ijmuiden it is believed that the coke ovens were hit.Offensive operations by Fighter and Army Co-operation Commands wererestricted by bad weather and. were, in the main, uneventful. Targets attackedincluded gun positions at Le Touquet and hangars at De Kooy and Lannionaerodromes.From the above operations, six of our aircraft are missing.Aircraft of the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit and of Army Co-operationCommand flew a total of 41 photographic sorties.Night.49. Bomber Command operated against land targets on two nights onlyduring.the week, when 347 aircraft were despatched. The comparable figure lastweek was 1,493.A force of 80 heavy bombers opei&apos;ated, against Munich and dropped 162 tonsof incendiaries and H.E. (including 33 x 4,000 lbs.) in an attack which was completed in thirty minutes. Aided by good visibility and flares accuratelyplaced by Pathfinders, many large fires were started which were seen to be burningstrongly by one of the last aircraft to leave. On the same night, 118 aircraft were despatched to saarbrucken but heavy ground haze made difficult the task of thePathfinders, whose flares were more scattered than usual. About 153 tons ofH.E. and incendiaries were dropped and good fires reported in the town wereconfirmed by the crews of aircraft returning from Munich.Wismar, the Dornier factory to the north-west of Wismar and the ship-building yards at Flensburg and Vegesack were the targets for 135 heavy bombers. Over both Wismar and Vegesack heavy cloud with a base down to about.500 ft. made identification extremely difficult, but some fires were seen in thetown of Wismar, and it is also probable that the Dornier factory was hit.After experiencing extremely bad weather over the North Sea the aircraftdetailed on the shipbuilding yards at Flensburg found a sudden improvement onthe run down the Danish coast, and excellent visibility prevailed over the target,which, being situated on a promontory, was easily pinpointed in the moonlight.The majority of aircraft attacked from 1,500 feet, and bursts of bombs andone large explosion were seen in the shipyards. Fires started by incendiariesappeared to be taking hold as our aircraft left. On these four targets a total ofabout 190 tons of H.E. and incendiaries was dropped.The 23 Fighter Command aircraft despatched on Intruder operationsattacked about 16 trains and locomotives, but found negligible activity overenemy aerodromes.From the week&apos;s operations 20 bombers and one Intruder aircraft are missing, and a further two bombers crashed in this country.Coastal Operations.50. Coastal Command despatched 438 sorties, of which 242 were engaged on anti-U-boat operations and 26 on convoy sorties. Bomber Command aircraft flew 38 sorties on patrols west of the Bay of Biscay. Fighter Command flew 611shipping protection patrols.Off the Norwegian coast, two vessels of about 5,500 tons and 2,000 tons respectively were hit with torpedoes, the former being left enveloped in smokeand the latter on fire.
Totals of 27 Hudsons and five Naval Swordfish made three night attacks onconvoys off the Dutch coast. In one of these attacks 50 flame foats droppedaround the convoy by one Hudson so illuminated the target that the remainingten aircraft were able to carry out their bombing attack. One vessel of 6,000tons and two of 4,000 tons were hit. In the other two operations, a Swordfishscored a probable hit with a torpedo on a large merchant vessel and bombingaircraft may have damaged others with near misses.Ten Wellingtons of Coastal Command attacked the docks and shipping inthe Bassin Nord at Bordeaux, but no.definite results were seen.Spitfires of Fighter Command operating off the Dutch coast sank a 500-tonvessel and set fire to a flak ship.Beaufighters on patrol oft&apos; Brest destroyed three enemy aircraft (including one F.W. Condor), and off Selsey Bill a Ju. 88 was destroyed by U.S.A.A.C.Spitfires.From the above operations five of our aircraft are missing.Sea mining in enemy waters has been on a heavy scale, Bomber and CoastalCommands having despatched 165 and five ,sorties respectively. A total of 446mines were laid for the loss of twelve aircraft in operations which extendedas far east as Konigsberg.Mediterranean.Egypt and Libya.51. In the week ending the 21st September, 1,162 sorties were flown by allied aircraft compared with 1,498 in the previous week.Although operations were hampered by sandstorms, our fighters maintainedreconnaissance and offensive patrols over the battle area and provided protection for shipping off the Egyptian Coast. Fighter-bombers attacked M.T. in theNorthern Sector and started an oil fire. At night, Hurricanes carried outintruder patrols against enemy landing grounds, M.T. and camps. Severalvehicles were destroyed or damaged and many fires were started.Shipping and harbour installations at Tobruk were heavily bombed on five nights by Halifaxes and Wellingtons. Large fires were started on the quays andjetties and near petrol installations, and a small ship was probably hit.Benghazi Harbour was bombed by U.S.A.A.C. and R.A.F. Liberators.Two vessels of about 7,000 tons were hit. Photographs taken on the following day showed that one vessel was completely destroyed and the other seriously damaged.   The harbour at Mersa Matruh was also bombed.Heavy attacks were made on enemy landing grounds, especially on two nearEl Daba which were bombed by 21 Wellingtons and 17 Bostons. successful attacks were also carried out on M.T. in the Bardia, Sollum and Fuka areas.Six Me. 109s bombed a landing ground near Amiriya and two othersmachine-gunned a landing ground north-west of Cairo. Two aircraft bombedEdku (near Alexandria) causing some casualties.Malta.52. Enemy activity against Malta was again on a small scale. Severalformations of fighters approached the Island but withdrew when they sightedour Spitfires.   Four bombers made landfall but caused no damage.Sicily.53. Spitfires carried out several offensive reconnaissances of Southern Sicilyby day. During one of these reconnaissances, two Spitfires, destroyed two flying boats which were taking off.At night, Beaufighters flew intruder patrols over the island. AtPorto Empedocle, E-boats were attacked and hit.Sea Communications.54. Beaufighters bombed and probably sank a 2,000-ton merchant vesseloff the Tunisian coast.A southbound convoy, consisting of three merchant vessels and two destroyers,was attacked by Wellingtons 66 miles north-east of Derna. Two merchant vessels were hit and one was low in the water when last seen.Wellingtons from Malta attacked a convoy consisting of two merchant vessels and seven destroyers on a southerly course off the south-west coast Of Greece.[24394]
Near misses were obtained on two destroyers. Later, the convoy was attacked bya Liberator and a Wellington from Egypt, but an effective smoke-screen hamperedthe attack.   The Liberator scored two near misses on a destroyer.A 6,000-ton tanker, escorted by three destroyers, on a south-easterly course was attacked off the south-west coast of Greece by Beauforts and Beaufighters.The destroyers were hit with cannon fire and one of the ships was torpedoed.The convoy was attacked later by Wellingtons, which obtained near misses onthe tanker.Beaufighters bombed and machined-gunned three schooners 24 miles east ofTripoli (L). One schooner was set on fire. Another Beaufighter scored severalhits on a medium-sized ship off Licata in Sicily.Russian Front.55. The Russians claim that in the week ending the 19th September theGermans lost 310 aircraft against 205 of their own.In the North, Russian bombers made several attacks on Luostari and Banakaerodromes, and on enemy positions south of Lake Ladoga.In the Stalingrad sector, Russian bombers and fighters continuously attacked enemy troops and communications.In the Caucasus, heavy attacks were made on Novorossisk, on enemy troopsnear Mozdok, on bridges over the Terek and on the aerodrome at Maikop.Successful attacks were made on enemy shipping in the Black Sea ports.Several small naval vessels were sunk and some merchant vessels were damaged.In the Crimea, aerodromes and troop concentrations were bombed.The main enemy effort was again directed against the Stalingrad sector,where important railway junctions and fuel dumps were bombed. Oil tankerson the Volga were also bombed.In the Central and Northern sectors, strong bombing forces attacked Russiansupply depots, aerodromes and railway communications. A cargo vessel was sunkon Lake Ladoga and two other vessels were damaged.In the Caucasus, Russian supply routes and communications were attacked,and in the Black Sea a floating dock and a merchant vessel were bombed and damaged.Burma.56. U.S.A.A.C. Mitchells, operating in pairs, made four successful attacks on enemy objectives. At Kalewa a steamer ran aground as the result of a machine-gun attack; in the Katha area an oil barge was hit and barracks and a railway station were damaged; barracks at Nankan (35 miles south-west of Katha) were hit, and damage was done to the aerodromes at Tingka and Myitkyina.Supplies were dropped on five occasions to Chinese forces in North Burma.New Guinea.57. U.S.A.A.C. and R.A.A.F. fighters and medium bombers continued toharass the enemy in the Buna/Kokoda area. About 65 aircraft were engaged onthese operations and, in addition to hits on fuel and stores dumps, particularlysuccessful attacks were made on barges at Buna, where photographs confirm that,in one attack alone, 27 were set on fire and burnt out.Night attacks by U.S.A.A.C. Fortresses were made on the aerodromes atVunakanau, Lae and Salamaua, and on targets at Lakunai and Rabaul.The only enemy activity reported is an attack on Rorana aerodrome (35 miles north-west of Port Moresby) by about 25 escorted heavy bombers. No damage was caused.Solomon Islands.58. Catalinas made three attacks on Buka and on an aerodrome in thevicinity.Aleutian Islands.59. On the 14th, U.S.A.A.C. fighters and bombers made a successful attackon Kiska. Two mine-sweepers were sunk, three large cargo ships and three submarines were damaged by bombs and machine-gun fire. Four Japanesefighters were shot down and a large seaplane was destroyed on the water.
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.60. There have been no large-scale raids, but bombs have been dropped onfive days and three nights of the week.
