E. BRIDGES,Secretary of the War Cabinet.Great George Street, S.W. 1,October 5, 1942,; - ;     .  .&apos;     -.    (A)Minute from the Secretary of State for India to the Prime Minister.Prime Minister,In accordance with War Cabinet Conclusions 129 (42) of the 24th September,I send you (a) a draft of the assurance which the War Cabinet desiredshould be conveyed to the Chancellor of the Chamber of Princes in replyto his letter of the 1st June (Annexure B in W.P. (42) 391). The assurance wouldbe conveyed by the Crown Representative and embodied in a letter, with the full text of which it is not necessary for me to trouble you.As the draft differs so substantially from the form of reply which the crown representative recommended, I feel it very desirable that he should be given anopportunity to comment on its terms before it issues. I would therefore propose,if you think the draft generally suitable, to communicate it to the Crown Repre-sentative under a telegram, of which I also enclose a draft (b).L. S. AMERY.India Office, S.W.1, October 1, 1942:[24443]
(a) Draft of Proposed Assurance to the Chancellor of the Chamber of Princes.(1) The general nature of the policy envisaged by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the particular action contemplated to bring it into effect were set forth inthe draft Declaration which Sir Stafford Cripps discussed with a number of princes and Ministers of States. That policy implies no intention to depart fromthe continued observance by the Crown of its obligations by Treaty or otherwisetowards the States in so far as they elect to remain outside such new constitution for India as may be devised by agreement.(2) His Majesty&apos;s Government see no present reason to redefine or amplifytheir conception of those obligations, nor should a recent statement by the lord privy Seal in the House of Commons, regarding the desirability of encouragingand expediting the development in all Indian States of suitable representativeinstitutions, be taken as in any way inconsistent with them.(3) The fact that no explicit provision was contained in the draft Declarationfor the formation of any Union of non-adhering States or groups of States is notto be taken as constituting any discrimination to the disadvantage of the states as compared with the Provinces of British India. His Majesty&apos;s government recognise a direct responsibility for the form of government enjoyed in theProvinces of British India, while they have no such direct responsibility withinthe territories of the Pulers of the Indian States. Hence, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment saw no reason at that juncture to enter into a discussion of the detailedissues involved in such a development.(b) Draft telegram from Secretary of State to Crown Representative.Your telegram of the 25th August, 2591P. Draft reply to Jam Sahib hasbeen discussed by War Cabinet whose view is that since the terms of any replymade are likely &quot;to become known (vide end of paragraph 5 of your telegram)it would be better that the reply should be given &quot;publicly.&quot; They considerthat the objections to making the&apos;reply public would not apply to a short, simplestatement which i1^ their view should follow the lines of the draft contained inmy immediately succeeding telegram.2. The draft is in the form of a letter from your Political Adviser tothe Chancellor which could be communicated by one or other to the press. Itdoes not refer specifically to the Jam Sahib&apos;s letter (which was marked &quot; Secret &quot;)but generally to representations made by the Princes, The Prime Minister asksme to say that he would welcome any criticisms that you may have to offer onthe wording before he finally approves the draft.3. I think it would be helpful to the Prime Minister to have your viewsalso on the following points which occur to me in this connection : (i) Would you apprehend any unfavourable reactions from British Indianparties if such a statement were published, seeing that none of - them has received a similar clarification or explanation of the draft declaration subsequent to the Cripps Mission?(ii) You and I are, I think, in general agreement that nothing shouldbe done to cause the Princes to relax their efforts to set their houses in order and prepare in this way for whatever the future may hold.Do you think a published statement on the above lines would encourage them in any way to sit back and rely on His Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s support rather than on their own efforts?(iii) We cannot afford to be pushed into a discussion as to how we intend to carry out our treaty obligations. Is there more risk ofembarrassing pressure of this kind arising from a short publishedstatement on the lines indicated than from the procedure proposedin your telegram ?(iv) Would you consider it advisable in so far as the proposed statementdoes not cover all the points raised by the J am Sahib to supplementit by a confidential letter dealing with the remaining points on thelines discussed between us?4. It is clearly important that the answer to the Chancellor&apos;s letter shouldnot be delayed much longer and I hope you will be able to let me have your viewsurgently on the above points and any other considerations that you would wishto put to me.
5. In view of the representation received from Hyderabad regardingCommons statement by Cripps (Chhatari&apos;s letter of the 15th August) it seems desirable that a letter should be sent to Chhatari in similar terms (with thenecessary verbal alterations) to that sent to the Jam Sahib.(B)Alternative Draft of Proposed Assurance to the Chancellor of the Chamber of princes, circulated by direction of the Prime Minister.(1) His Majesty&apos;s Governmenfe^^ly adhere to their obligations by Treaty orotherwise towards the States. Thev see no reason to re-defme their conception of those obligations -r nor^shourd: recent statement by the Lord privy seal in the House of Commons,yregarding the desirability of encouraging andexpediting the development in all Indian States of suitable representativeinstitutions, be ta^eiarasHn-^y^way inconsistent with them.(2) The fact that no explicit provision was contained in the draft Declara-tion for the formation of any Union of non-adhering States or groups of states is not to be taken as constituting any discrimination to the disadvantage of theStates as compared with the Provinces of British India. The draft Declarationcontained a provision on this matter in regard to non-acceding Provinces, butnot in regard to non-adhering States, because the responsibility which HisMajesty&apos;s Government have exercised for many years for the Government of theProvinces- of British India finds no parallel within the territories of the Rulersof Indian States.\
