FOR BUES.-L-.I report for the infornation of ::.y colleagues thatthe Governor of Duma has xoroposed and that I have agreed thathe should issue a Proclamation under Section 139 of the Governmentof Burae. Act declaring that all his functions shall he excorcisodhy hln in his discretion and assuaing to hiaiself all the powers ofthe Legislature.     This action is necessary owing to the impossibility of surrionihg the Chambers of the Legislature (whichhave in fact already boon dissolved) and consequently of conductinthe affairs of Buma in accordance with the provisions of the Act.One consequence will be that the two ilinisters who accx.ipaniodthe Governnont of Buma to India will cease to be &quot;hindstors&quot;.I anticipate, however, that Sir R. Doruan-Saith &apos;..ill appoint then to posts on the salaries drawn by then as hinistcrs.     He will thus be able to continue to avail hiasolf of their services in onadvisory cc.po.city as ho docs at present.     It is proposed that the proclamation should issue in the near future as zoon as certain points of detail ;:.s to its contents have boon settled.L* S.
