(42) 422.September 22, 1942.WAR CABINET.INDIAN&quot; STERLING BALANCES.Note by the Prime Minister.WITH reference to W.P. (42) 421, I circulate for consideration a revised draft of the proposed telegram to the Viceroy about the War Financial settlement with India.   New or amended passages are printed in italics.W. S. C.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,September 22, 1942.Draft Telegram from the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy.The War Cabinet have given further consideration to the question of theWar Financial Settlement, of 1940 and! T^ave reached the following general conclusions :- (yThe War Cabinet fully recognise that a considerable proportion of theexpenditure so far incurred by the Government of India and recoverable by Indiaunder the 1940 settlement contributes to the general war effort but otherwisebears no relation to the defence of India. They recognise also that the spread of the war to the Tar East has meant that India is now incurring far moreexpenditure in her own local defence than was contemplated when the settlementof April 1940 was concluded. They wish to acknowledge the extent of theresources in men and material which India is making available as part of thecommon war effort of the United Nations.I24.M80:
The War Cabinet nevertheless feel that they should put on record their view that the entry of Japan into the war, finally revealing the war as a worldstruggle against the forces of tyranny and reaction, has fundamentally changed the situation since the financial settlement of 1940 was negotiated. Great changesin the scope and character of the war have taken place since then, and even greater changes may take place. At that time the war ivas not being^actively waged in the Eastern, hemisphere, nor ivas India exposed toimminent danger of invasion. To-day no country can afford to take a limitedview of the nature of the struggle in its entirety, nor of the measures required for its own defence. This changed situation calls for a widerconception of India&apos;s partnership in the general war effort of the United nations and, therefore, of the contribution she needs to make in her own defence.The financial settlement as it stands leads to the United Kingdom accumulatinglarge indebtedness to India on expenditure, much of which has been incurred inIndia&apos;s defence and, in the common task. British industry, instead of meetingthe adverse balance by exports, is absorbed in the output of munitions,and three-quarters of British shipping is carrying troops and war supplies.President Eoosevelt has recently enunciated the principle that none of the united nations should end the war with a monetary war debt to any of its partners.His Majesty&apos;s Government are impressed alike with the general wisdom of this objective and with the necessity to bear it in mind in the relations between thiscountry and India.&apos;&apos;lt w7ill be recalled that?&apos;at the time when the financial settlement of April1940 was under discussion.&quot; the Chancellor of the Exchequer stipulated that thepossibility of India&apos;s making some payment towards the general cost of the war should be considered from time to time as circumstances permitted.His Majesty&apos;s Government do not suggest that a new settlement or newaccotcnt keeping should be negotiated at the present juncture with the Govern?menfof India. We are, hoxvever, also keeping our own account, which may eventually serve as the basis of a counter-claim, in which such items as the naval,air and military defence of India by British forces will play their part. Afurther review and an eventual adjustment of financial relations between theUnited Kingdom and India will assuredly be requiredTwhether at the end of thewar or upon some earlier appropriate occasionTjin the light and in the frameworkboth of the general financial settlement between the Allied Nations and of the vital importance for all concerned of the speedy restoration of the maximumvolume of world trade.
