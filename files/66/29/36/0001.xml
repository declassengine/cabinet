Copy No.W.P. (42) 456.October 10, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.UNITED STATES COLOURED TROOPS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.AS pointed out in the memorandum by the Secretary of State for War(W.P. (42) 441), the Home Office has issued to Chief Constables in England andWales a circular letter advising them as to the attitude which they should adopt towards American coloured troops in this country, and a similar circular has beenissued by the Secretary of State for Scotland to the Scottish police.The Home Office circular, of which a copy is appended to this memorandum,was issued after consultation with the Foreign Office, the Ministry ofInformation and the Chairman of the Bolero Committee. General Eisenhowerwas shown in advance a copy of the draft circular, and he expressed &quot; completeaccord with the instructions &quot; which the Home Office proposed to issue. In his letter to the Home Office General Eisenhower said : &quot; This policy of non-discrimination is exactly the policy which has always been followed by the UnitedStates Army. Subordinate United States Army Commanders in the EuropeanTheater of Operations are being informed of the proposed action of the HomeOffice. With reference to the question of placing certain places out of bounds,we do not make any restrictions of that kind on the basis of colour. The policyfollowed by the United States Army Authorities is that places put out of boundsfor United States soldiers are out of bounds to all United States army personnel.&quot;So far as the attitude to be adopted by the police is concerned it will be seenthat they have been advised not themselves to exercise any discrimination againstUnited States coloured troops in this country, and not to encourage suchdiscrimination by licensees of cinemas, public houses, restaurants or other places of public entertainment.2. Reports received by the Home Office from Chief Officers of Police showthat on the whole the American coloured troops in this country have behavedwell, and that, apart from isolated incidents, there have been no. difficultiescreated by the association, of American coloured troops with the civil population.On the other hand, some of the Regional Commissioners have expressedconsiderable apprehension as to the difficulties likely to be created in theirRegions by the presence of American coloured troops, and their association withthe civil population, and particularly with British women. Some regional commissioners have informed me that, in their experience, some British womenappear to find a peculiar fascination in associating with men of colour, and thatthis association is resented by American white soldiers and is likely to give riseto difficult social problems in their Regions. They have also urged that the morale of British troops is likely, to be^upset by rumours that their wives anddaughters are being debauched by American coloured troops.[24472]
3. The question for the Cabinet, as I see it, is whether any advice shouldbe given by the Government as to the attitude which should be adopted towardsAmerican coloured soldiers and, if so, to whom that advice should be given andin what terms. The War Office proposal is that Service personnel should beinformed of the facts and history of the colour question in the United States ofAmerica and the United States Army, and should be educated by private lecturesfrom their officers to adopt towards American coloured troops what is supposed to be the attitude of the United States Army Authorities. If, however, it were decided that such advice should be given to Service personnel, would the matterend there? If, for example, in any area Civil Defence workers were found to befraternising unduly with coloured troops, would it not be the duty of the Ministerof Home Security to give some advice to these persons? Would it notultimately be necessary to give some information to the police .as to thepolicy of the Government? Service personnel would inevitably inform the police and licensees of public houses, for example, of the nature of the advice whichthey had received, however confidentially, and the advice given to service personnel would soon percolate throughout the rest of the community, possibly inan exaggerated and distorted form. It appears that any advice which goesbeyond the mere imparting to Service personnel of information as to the colourproblem in the United States is bound to give rise to this type of difficulty, andthe mere imparting of such information may itself give rise to a demand for advice as to the correct behaviour to be used towards American coloured troops,having regard to the varying attitudes adopted towards the colour problem indifferent parts of the United States.4. The proposal that British Service personnel should adopt towards theUnited States coloured troops the attitude of the United States Army Authoritiesseems to assume that the Americans do in fact wish to maintain in this country a policy of segregation similar&apos;to that followed in the United States or in some parts of the United States. General Eisenhower&apos;s letter, however, statescategorically that it is not part of the policy of the United States Army to placeout of&apos;bounds to coloured troops places which are not also out. of bounds to othermembers of the United States forces; and in this country where separate canteens,public houses, cinemas or places of entertainment are not available for coloured people it is difficult to see how effect could be given to a policy of segregation.Moreover, there would be a large body of opinion in this country which would strongly resent a policy under which British citizens were advised to treatcoloured persons in the same way as the United States Army Authorities aresupposed to treat them.It appears from General Eisenhower&apos;s letter that there is some reason forthinking that the American Army Headquarters take a broader and moretolerant view of the question than local American Army Commanders. Is the explanation that the official American policy has not yet been fully understood by subordinate Commanders of the American Forces in this country ? Moreover,the American troops have not yet been in this country sufficiently long to enablethem to appreciate the British attitude towards the delicate question of colourprejudice, while the British people themselves have not had sufficient experienceon a large scale of the colour problem to enable them to appreciate the Americanpoint of view.5. I am fully conscious that a difficult social problem might be created ifthere were a substantial number of cases of sex relations between white women and coloured troops and the procreation of half-caste children : but I am doubtfulwhether the policy suggested by the War Office would have any effect in checkingthis danger. The educative methods suggested in the War Office memorandum are unlikely to have any influence on the class of women who are attracted bycoloured men.Although there is among Regional Commissioners some concern about this danger, I have no information to suggest that it is serious at the present time;but I propose that a careful watch should be kept on this aspect of the problem.6. There is also no doubt a risk that respectable English girls may notrealise that if they show to coloured men from the United States the samefriendliness as they commonly show to our own Service men the coloured manfrom America is likely to misunderstand their intentions and their character;and the creation of such misunderstanding is unfair to him and may be dangerous to the girls. I can therefore see a case for giving some warning to the members ofthe A.T.S. and the other women&apos;s Services on this subject.
APPENDIX.(Confidential.)American Coloured Troops.Home Office, Whitehall, S. W. 1,Sir, September 4, 1942.1. I AM directed by the Secretary of State to say that, as you are nodoubt aware, the American troops who are now coming to this country in increasing numbers include a certain proportion of coloured troops.2. From reports which the Secretary of State has received from various parts of the country it appears that there is ground for thinking that difficultiesmay be caused by the presence among the civil population of coloured troops,and by their association both with other troops and with British women.3. It is not the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government that any discriminationas regards the treatment of coloured troops should be made by the british authorities. The Secretary of State, therefore, would be glad if you would be good enough to take steps to ensure that the police do not make any approach to the proprietors of public houses, restaurants, cinemas or other places ofentertainment with a view to discriminating against coloured troops.4. If the American Service authorities decide to put certain places outof bounds for their coloured troops, such prohibition can be effected only bymeans of an Order issued by the appropriate American Army and naval authorities. The police should not make themselves in any way responsible forthe enforcement of such orders.I am.Sir,Your obedient servant,F. A. NEWSAM.The Chief Constable.As regards, however, educating the personnel of the Army &quot; to adopt towardsthe United States coloured troops the attitude of the United States ArmyAuthorities,&quot; I am doubtful whether any such practical advantages would ensuefrom such a course as to outweigh the disadvantages which are likely to arise when the men and women concerned attempt to follow in practice the instructions which have been given to them, and from the controversy which will arise when,as must almost inevitably happen, there is some public disclosure, possibly in adistorted form, of the nature of those instructions.H. M.Home Office,October 10, 1942.
