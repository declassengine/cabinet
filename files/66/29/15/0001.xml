(42) 435.September 28, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.SOVIET WARSHIPS AND MERCHANT SHIPS IN THE BLACK SEA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and first Lord of the Admiralty.THE question of the disposal of the Soviet tanker fleet and warships in the black Sea was raised in W.P. (42) 355 of the 12th August. The Cabinet thenapproved the despatch of telegrams by the Foreign Office to His Majesty&apos;ammbassadors at Moscow and Angora (Nos. 144 to Moscow and 1280 and 1281 toAngora), which are reprinted in Annex I.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Moscow reported on the 16th August in his telegram No. 86 (Annex II) that it had been decided, after consultation with thePrime Minister, that it was not an appropriate moment to raise the matter withthe Soviet Government.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Angora has since then set out his views onthe Turkish aspect of the question, before and after consultation, with admiral Kelly, in his telegrams Nos. 1521 of the 17th August and 1528 of the18th August (Annex III).In the light of these two telegrams I should judge that the TurkishGovernmenfs attitude would probably be as follows : (1) Soviet Black Sea tanker fleet.The Turkish Government would probably allow Soviet tankers through theStraits into the iEgean, and might even be prepared to facilitate their passage.The Turkish Government would evidently expect the Soviet Government in returnto discharge oil from the tankers at Istanbul. The Turkish Government would presumably be prepared to adopt the same attitude towards the remainder of theSoviet merchant fleet in the Black Sea.(2) Soviet warships in the Black Sea.The Turkish Government would probably be receptive to the idea of purchasing some of the Soviet warships in the Black Sea, but would wish to assure themselves in the first place of German acquiescence. His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Angora does not think that a sale of Soviet warships on a limited scale would provoke a really serious German reaction. On the other hand, itseems hardly likely that the Germans, if asked, would acquiesce in such a transaction unless they felt fairly certain that they were not damaging their own interests and that they could make capital with the Turks out of theiracquiescence. None the less, the balance of advantage from our.point of view would lie in promoting such a transaction, which would release&quot; vis from ourobligation to deliver to the Turks the two destroyers and two submarines whichwe are under contract to supply.The dangers arising from the internment of Soviet warships in Turkish portswill depend largely on the number and fighting quality of the ships still left tobe interned. The Soviet Black Sea fleet consists of one old battleship, fourcruisers (two new), one new flotilla leader, six modern destroyers, four old11864   [24410]     - , b
destroyers, nine small destroyers and twenty-four submarines. It can be assumed that the internment of anything like the whole of this fleet would certainly arouseGerman suspicion. Although no doubt the Germans would not, merely on accountof the presence of such a fleet in Turkish ports, attack Turkey, unless it suitedtheir general policy to do so, the fact that there is a possibility that the ships,by being interned in Turkish ports, might eventually become available for theuse of the Allies if Turkey later came into the war on our side, would render thepresence of the whole or the major part of this fleet in Turkish waters a potentialsource of friction between Germany and Turkey, which in its turn would be a constant source of anxiety and trouble to His Majesty&apos;s Government.However, the Russians are likely to fight their ships to the bitter end, andit can therefore perhaps -be assumed that only a depleted force, some of thesurviving units being more or less seriously damaged, would be available for internment. The presence of such a depicted force in Turkish ports would obviously be much less likely to lead, to difficulties with Germany. The TurkishPrime Minister appears to view with equanimity and even satisfaction theprospect of the fleet being interned in Turkish wraters. and has said that if theGermans demanded that the fleet should be handed over to them Turkey would go to war. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Angora lias, however, waited us notto attach too much importance to these brave words.Although the course least likely to lead to complications would obviously bethat the Soviet warships (less any sold to the Turks) should be sunk in deepwater, on balance we think that the advantage lies in the ships being interned in turkish ports in spite of the risk of political complications, provided that, asmay be anticipated, their number is not too large. In any case the Russians areperfectly capable of deciding themselves as to the future of their Black Sea fleet and it would be invidious for us to tender advice unsolicited. For instance, theSoviet Government might interpret advice to sink the ships as being given withthe ulterior motive of destroying the Soviet Union&apos;s position as a naval Power.It is not suggested that these matters should be raised officially with either the Turkish or Soviet Governments at the present moment. But the case for doing so may &quot;arise at short notice and if and. when that moment arrives we would propose that we should : (a) Assist the passage of the Soviet tanker fleet and possibly some other important units of mercantile marine from the Black Sea . to the-aegean and provide such protection as may be possible until Britishwaters are reached as was done in the case of certain Soviet tankersand ice breakers earlier in the year (see W.P. (42) 355, paragraph 8),and endeavour to induce the Soviet Government to deliver oil to theTurkish Government by these tankers provided that this will notaccumulate Turkish stocks in dangerous areas.(b) Sound the Soviet and the Turkish Governments on the question of a saleof some of the Soviet warships in the Black Sea to the TurkishGovernment on the lines adumbrated in paragraph 6 of ForeignOffice telegram No. 144 to Moscow (Annex I).(c) On the assumption that the Soviet fleet will have been reduced by enemy action and some of the surviving units more or less seriously damaged,leave the Soviet Government to make their own decision whether to sink the remainder of their warships in the Black Sea or have theminterned in Turkish ports. If, however, we are consulted, we should advise the internment of a nucleus of the more valuable ships, offering to use our good offices with the Turks in whatever way required bythe Soviet Government, and the sinking of the remainder. This wouldhave the additional advantage of helping to cover up the transaction-tion in (&amp;).id) In the less probable eventuality of the great majority of the Soviet fleetbeing available after the fall of the Soviet Black Sea ports, we should draw the attention of the Soviet Government to the political complica-tions which might arise from the presence of so large a fleet internedin Turkish waters and the consequent risk of the warships falling into german hands, and advise them to sink at least a proportion of the warships, offering our good offices with the Turkish Government asin (c) above in respect of the nucleus to be interned.A.

348ANNEX I.(1)Mr. Eden to Sir A. Clark Kerr (Moscow).(No. 144.   Most Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, August 13, 1942.WE have been considering position of Russian Black Sea warships and merchant ships in the event of loss of Black Sea ports.2. Tankers.-Important Russian tanker fleet would be of great value to united Nations, but, in view of present situation over the Second Front, it may .be inadvisable * press Soviet authorities at this stage to pass.their ships out intothe Mediterranean. If circumstances arise where tankers are no longer of any use in Black Sea or you suppose that the Soviet Government will wish o passany of these tankers into the Mediterranean for use in Northern waters, we shallbe glad to make arrangements on similar lines to those of last autumn and to give them every assistance in our power. The same, of course, applies to other Russianmerchant vessels in the Black Sea.3. Operations of last year were facilitated by the discharge of oil atIstanbul (Constantinople) for the Turks. Promise of similar transfer of oil mighthave important effect on Turkish attitude, particularly in the case of oilers of doubtful status.4. Turks have no right whatever to interfere with passage of merchant ships through the Straits, but Admiral Kelly has reported that they may open fire on tankers that approach the Bosphorus without first removing their defensive armament. This attitude is intelligible for Fleet Oilers, but in the past Turks have always permitted genuine merchant ships to retain defensive equipment. Sinceretention of defensive armament is essential for passage through the -aegean, wewould, if Russians desire, represent to Turks the right of merchant ships toretain it.5. Warships have no legal right to pass through the Straits, and AdmiralKelly reports that they will not be allowed to proceed even as far as the Sea of marmora for internment without first going to Eregli to be disarmed and to pickup Turkish naval escort. Attempt by surface warships to force passage ofStraits would almost certainly be resisted by Turks. Hostilities between turkey and Russia which would probably result from such an attempt would haveincalculable consequences, greatly outweighing advantages of passing a fewvessels through to safety. We therefore much hope Soviet authorities would not contemplate it. The course least likely to lead to subsequent complications wouldbe that the Soviet warships should be sunk in deep water. The alternative wouldbe that they should be interned in Turkish ports until Turkey abandons her present neutral position. This would have the attraction of saving the fleet for possible use at a later date on the side of the Allies. But there is a danger that meanwhile the presence of this fleet in Turkish ports might lead1 to dangerouscomplications between Turkey and Germany. There is also the possibility thatin that case the Germans might use such pressure as to force Turkey to surrenderthe ships to Germany.6. The following suggestion has, however, occurred to us : We are atpresent under obligations to deliver to Turkey towards the end of the year twoFleet destroyers and two submarines. It is conceivable that, if the Russiansagreed to transfer to the Turks, either before or after internment, a sufficiently attractive number of new destroyers, submarines, or even a cruiser, the Turksmight be ready to release us from our obligations. We in turn would transfer to the Russians for their Northern Fleet the two new destroyers and submarinesat present destined for Turkey. The advantage of a sale before internment wouldbe that the crews might be saved from internment and, if necessary, passed out into the Mediterranean in a Russian merchant ship to assist in manning the ships that we transfer &apos;to the Northern Fleet.7. We realise that the Turks would be afraid of German reactions if theyentered into such a bargain. But they might be tempted to do so if the offer ofRussian ships were sufficiently generous and if they felt certain that the only part of the bargain that the Germans need know was the sale of Russian ships to:        [24410] - b 2
Turkey, and not the transfer to the Russians of the ships which we are under contract to give to the Turks.8. I snail be glad of your views as to whether it would be advisable ornecessary to raise these matters with the Soviet Government either now or later.(2)Mr. Eden to Sir H. KnatcJibull-Hugessen (Angora).(No. 1280.   Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, August 13, 1942.Please repeat urgently to Sir A. Clark Kerr at Moscow any comments which you may wTish to offer on my telegram No. 144 to Moscow. You should inparticular give your views on the political consequences oi the Russian fleetbeing interned in Turkish ports.(3)Mr. Eden to Sir H. Knatchbxill-Hugessen (Angora).(No. 1281.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, August 13, 1942.My telegram No. 144 to Moscow [of 13th August: Soviet Black Sea Fleet].In connexion with the suggestion in paragraph 6, you should know of thefollowing recent precedent. A damaged German submarine put into Cartagenasome time ago and was allowed a period of three months for repairs. Just, before this period elapsed early this month, Sir S. Hoare reminded the Spanish Govern-ment that His Majesty&apos;s Government expected the submarine and the crew tobe interned at the end of the three months&apos; period. The Spanish Governmentreplied that the question of interning the submarine did not arise, as the germans had sold it to them. We cannot find any adequate grounds to contest thelegality of this sale. The case is, in many ways, parallel to that of the UnitedStates aircraft recently interned in Turkey.ANNEX II,Sir A. Clark Kerr to Mr. Eden.(No. 86.   Most Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Moscow, August 16, 1942.&quot;Sour telegram No. 144..I have discussed this with the Prime Minister.   We agree that the present is not the appropriate moment to raise the question with Soviet Government.2.   Please pass to Angora.ANNEX III.(1)Sir H. Knatchbull-Hugessen to Mr. Eden.(No. 1521.  Most Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Angora, August 17, 1942.Your telegram No. 144 to Moscow.I propose to defer any comment regarding passage through the Straits of tankers or warships pending discussion with Admiral Kelly, whom I have askedto return from Istanbul (Constantinople) for this purpose.2. My first reaction to the suggestion of internment in Turkish ports is thatthis would lead to serious embarrassments, as the ships would be constant tempta-tion to Germany and, therefore, additional objective for German pressure on
Turkey. On the assumption that we wish at present to avoid complicationsbetween Turkey and Germany, we should not, 1 think, encourage the idea of internment. The fact that the Black Sea fleet would be available in Turkey for possible use at a later date on the side of the Allies is not, to my mind, so great anattraction as it may appear at first sight. It is clear that, unless attacked, Turkeyhas no intention of coming into the war, at least not until the last moment, whenthe issue is no longer in doubt, and at such a moment the value to us of the RussianBlack Sea fleet would no longer be very great. In the meantime, it would be a constant source of anxiety.3. I took the opportunity of an interview with the Prime Minister onthe 15th August on another subject, to ask his views on the future of the black sea fleet. This led him to comment generally on deterioration of Turco-Russianrelations. Since [group undecypherable] Russians had ceased to be friendly exceptfor a short period during M. Potemkin&apos;s visit in the summer of 1939 and in viewof the present Turco-Russian relations he did not expect the Russians toattempt to send the Black Sea fleet to Turkish ports. In fact he rather hopedthat they would not as it might involve him in difficulties with Germany. Onthe other hand, it might be very useful in certain eventualities to possess thefleet. In reply to my comment that it would be impossible to pass the fleet intothe Sea of Marmora (which he mentioned as possible place of internment) or,indeed, into any Turkish port without first disarming it, the Prime Ministerintimated that disarmament might be done in a very sketchy manner, theTurkish personnel being put on board and the Russian crews interned not faraway, so that they might be of use if required. I suggested that to have theRussian fleet in Turkish ports in such conditions would be a bait for theGermans, who might either bombard it or demand that it be handed over tothem. The Prime Minister at once said that in that case Turkey would go towar. (I am inclined to think he was referring only to the second of mysuggestions, i.e., a demand.for handing over the fleet.)4. Although the attitude of the Prime Minister thus seems satisfactory,I deprecate building too much on *it. Firstly, is it in our interest that Turkeyshould become belligerent with consequent calls upon us, and danger of loss of black Sea fleet into the bargain ? &quot;Secondly, the situation may not be so simpleand clear-cut as contemplated above. The Germans are perhaps less likely to force sudden issue than gradually to intensify pressure. And determined asthe Turks may be now to resist pressure, this determination might be affectedif the situation deteriorated, e.g., if further German successes in Russia and egypt led to virtual encirclement.5. I did not, of course, give any hint to the Prime Minister of the suggestionput forward in paragraph 6 of your telegram under reference. In view of hisremark that it might be useful in certain eventualities for the Turks to possess the fleet, it is possible that he might be attracted by the idea of limited transfersuggested, and even that the idea of more extensive transfer might occur to him.In the event of (a) wholesale transfer, or(b) limited transfer accompanied by the internment of the rest of the RussianBlack Sea fleet in Turkish waters the situation vis-a-vis germany would to my mind be more dangerous than that [group undecypher-able] mere internment of the whole fleet. I should, however, be inclined to doubt whether limited transfer suggested in your telegramwould in itself provoke really serious German reaction (moreparticularly if Germany was unaware of our part in the transaction)unless Germany intends to attack Turkey, anyhow, and is looking fora pretext. But modalities of operation would need careful working out, and I would prefer to consider the whole matter further beforeexpressing final opinion.. (2) , .Sir H. Knatchbull-Hugessen to Mr. Eden.(No. 1528.  Most Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Angora, Augtist 18, 1942.My telegram No. 1521.I have now had discussion with Admiral Kelly, who states that, far from having reported that the Turks might open fire on tankers approaching the bosphorus without having first removed defensive armament, he&quot; has no reason
to suppose that the Turks would do so. He considers the Turks would be preparedto assist the passing of tankers into the Mediterranean. This view is supportedby conversation of the 17th August between Naval Attache and Minister of communications on the subject of oil supplies to Turkey. Naval Attachesuggested that Russia should be asked to send oil. Minister welcomed the idea,and said twice during the conversation that if only Rsusia would help Turkey,Turkey would reciprocate, and he volunteered that if, after delivering oil inIstanbul (Constantinople), the Russian tankers wished to escape into theMediterranean Turkish pilots would be supplied to take them through Turkishwaters. Furthermore, existing regulations would be altered so as to allow themto travel through territorial waters by night. While the matter was one for direct discussion with the Russians, Minister hoped that I might assist by makingpreliminary suggestions to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. I have saidnothing on the point to Minister for Foreign Affairs, and do not propose to doso without instructions. But I doubt whether Minister of Communications wouldhave spoken as he did unless the matter had already been considered by theTurkish Cabinet, and you may think it worth while to pass on the idea to theSoviet Government.2. As regards disarmament of warships at Eregli before entering the sea of Marmora, please see Admiral Kelly&apos;s signal No. 1535 of the 6th April.3. As regards [group undecypherable] suggested in paragraph 6 of yourtelegram No. 144 to Moscow, conversations reported in Admiral Kelly&apos;s signal1843 of 28th October, 1941, to the Admiralty and subsequent correspondence,including his letter of 24th November, 1941, to the First Sea Lord, suggest thatTurks would not insist so long as the war lasts on the fulfilment of an obligationto deliver two more fleet destroyers and two more submarines. But I see noobjection to sounding them about the proposed transfer on the assumptions (a) that Russian agreement to their part of the transaction has first beenobtained, and(6) that our transfer to Russian northern fleet of destroyers and submarinesfor Turkey would not take place until after safe arrival in Turkishwaters of corresponding ships from Russian Black Sea fleet.4. It is possible that the Turkish Government might be reluctant to takeover ships from the Russian Black Sea fleet without having first assured them-selves of German acquiescence [ ? group omitted : ? which] they could hardlyask for until the ships had arrived in Turkish waters.5. On general [group undecypherable : ? question] raised in your telegram&quot;No. 1280 much would depend on number and fighting value of the ships from the black Sea fleet which may reach Turkey. Moreover, Germany will not attackTurkey until and unless it suits her general policy to do so. But the presence ofthe whole fleet in Turkish waters would certainly be added temptation and, as stated in my telegram No. 1421, a source of anxiety.
