office of the High Commissionerfor Canada,Canada House,Londono  S.W.1,10th October, 1942.My dear Secretary of State,I should like to refer to telegram No, 214 addressed toyou from my Government, containing their- reply to the requestmade to them by the Government of the United Kingdom, that german prisoners of war in Canada should be shackled in reprisalfor the fettering of prisoners of war by the German governments as you will have noted,  the decision of the canadian government to comply with this request has been reached withreluctance,  especially as it is felt that a policy of mutualreprisals v/ill result in a futile attempt to match v/ith theGermans an eye for an eye,, and that any contest in applyinghardships against prisoners of war the Germans are certain to win.As indicated in my Government *s telegram they consider itwould have been preferable to leave the Germans a face-savingescape before reprisals were applied on our side, by an offer to accept complete investigation by the Protecting Power,This course of action still remains open to usP and theCanadian Government consider on approach might be made throughthe Protecting Power alons the following lines.      It should beintimated to the Germans that as their action in placing fetterson Canadian and British prisoners of war is in clear violation of Article 2 of tho Geneva Convention;,  and as this measure ofreprisal was taken without any prior independent investigation, rv**the facts, which could have been arranged through the protectingPov/er, His Majesty5 s Government had no alternative but to place an equivalent number of German prisoners in handcuffs in like manner*At the same time the German Government might be invited to submitits charges regarding the tying of hands to the investigation ofthe Protecting Pov/er, and in the meantime to suspend the shacklingof prisoners of war on a reciprocal basis pending a report on thepart of the- Protecting Power,As an alternative to the above proposal it has occurred tome that there might be advantages in an unofficial intimationbeing made to the Protecting Power that if they were prepared to initiate an offer of mediation between the two parties we forour part would be prepared to accept them as referees,I should add that this is a personal suggestion which wouldhave to be referred to my Government for their views0It is felt by tho Canadian Government that unless some actionalong these lines is taken, there is evident danger that thewhole situation will develop into competitive reprisals with no limit in sight,  and I have received instructions from my government to express the hope that an issue will be found outof the present situation by adopting a course of action along the above lines,;Yours sincerely.;(Signed)    VINCENT MASSEYoThe Right Hon.
