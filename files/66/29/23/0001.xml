NAVAL  SITUATION.General Review.1. The total of U-boats operating in the Atlantic continues to increase.There has been a large number of attacks by ships and aircraft based in home waters.Concentrated attacks by U-boats on three convoys in the North Atlantic have resulted in the loss of four ships.   Shipping losses were relatively light.Two of H.M. destroyers have been lost.Our light forces have intercepted an enemy convoy off the Dutch coast.Home Waters and North Atlantic.2. H.M. Destroyer Veteran, one of the escorts of a homeward-bound convoy of river steamers, is presumed to have been sunk during U-boat attacks on the convoy early on the 26th in mid-Atlantic. Survivors from two ships of the convoywhich had previously been sunk were on board Veteran.3. An escorted convoy of six ships was attacked by our light forces offTerschelling on the night 30th/ 1st. One ship of 2.500 tons was torpedoed byM.T.B. 230 and blew up and the enemy escorts were heavily engaged. M.G.B. 18was hit and had to be abandoned after being set on fire. The Commanding Officerof M.G.B. 86 was killed, but other casualties were light.4. Naval aircraft, in conjunction with the R.A.F., have been engaged inminelaying operations, and attacks on shipping, off the French and Dutch coasts.Mediterranean.5. H.M. Submarine P. 35 sank a large ship 60 miles W.N.W. of Navarino(south-west coast of Greece) on the 27th. The Greek Submarine Nereus sank a ship of 1,500 tons and an 80-ton caique in the ^aegean.6. Naval aircraft co-operating with the R.A.F. torpedoed a destroyer off cape Spartivento on the night 28th/29th.7. The Vichy French Submarines L&apos;A wore, La Stdtane, Atalante,Arethuse and Perle passed Gibraltar westbound on the 29th.During the week 7,087 tons of French merchant shipping westbound^ and upwards of 5,000 tons eastbound., passed Gibraltar under escort.East Indies.8. The Vichy French S.S. Amiral Pierre (4,391 tons), after being sighted by aircraft of the South African Air Force, was intercepted by H.M. DestroyerNizam on the 29th. As the result of an attempt at scuttling by her crew, the shipsank while in tow, early the following morning, east of Lourenco Marques. the captain, crew and eight passengers are being taken to Durban.Pacific.Solomons.9. The U.S. Navy Department has announced the loss of the U.S. DestroyerJervis and the auxiliary transport Little off the Solomons.New Britain.10. A force of cruisers, seaplane-tenders and destroyers, with 14 merchant ships, including two tankers, was seen by air reconnaissance off Rabaul onthe 28th.Timor.- 11. H.M. Australian Destroyer Voyager ran aground on the south-east coast of Timor on the 23rd and, after being damaged by air attack, had to be destroyed by her crew. The ship&apos;s company have reached Australia. There wereseven minor casualties.Anti-Submarine Operations.12. Apart from attacks carried out from the U.S.A., 13 attacks on U-boatshave been made by surface craft and 25 by aircraft during the week.   A convoy
threatened by a concentration of U-boats in mid-Atlantic had the assistance ofan additional hunting group, available for the first time, which carried out twopromising attacks.Aircraft sighted seven U-boats and made six attacks in the vicinity of another homeward-bound convoy, south of Iceland (C), on a single day. At least two promising attacks were made by aircraft in the Bay of Biscay and one north of Iceland (C).Of the total attacks, two were carried out west of Norway, seven in the bay of Biscay, 17 south of Iceland (C) and in the North Atlantic/five in the Gulf of st. Lawrence, five in the West Atlantic and in the West Indies, and three in theSouth Atlantic. Among the aircraft attacks was,one carried out by a Liberatorat a distance of some 720 miles south-west of its base in Iceland (C).Enemy Intelligence.German.13.   There have been no important changes in the disposition of the german fleet.Italian.14. There has been a decrease in the amount of shipping arriving in north african ports, particularly Tripoli, during the week.Japanese.15. It is reported that ten Japanese seaplane-carriers are being used toferry aircraft between Japanese Home Waters and the New Guinea andSolomons area.U-boats.16. Activity of the U-boats now in the Atlantic has been widespread andsporadic; but there have been no further reports of the six U-boats which arethought to be in the eastern South Atlantic.In the Arabian Sea, at least four Japanese U-bbats are operating betweenthe Gulf of Aden and the Persian Gulf.German U-boats at present in service are believed to total between 380 and390, of which 180-190 are fully operational. It is estimated that by March 1943the total number may have reached 500.Protection of Seaborne Trade.17. During the Aveek ending the 27th-28th, 940 ships have been convoyed.Of these 166 were in ocean convoys and 774 in British coastal convoys. Oneanti-aircraft ship, 70 destroyers (including two United States destroyers) and105 sloops, cutters and corvettes (including four United States cutters) were employed on escort duties.During the week 167 ships, in three ocean convoys, arrived in the UnitedKingdom without loss.18. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 26th totalled 759,000 tons, compared with 911,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 707,000 tons for the past ten weeks. Ofthe week&apos;s imports, 276,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.19. During the month of August imports other than mineral oil totalled1,957,800 tons, of which 38,900 were from Eire. Imports under the Ministry ofFood totalled 709.400 tons, under the Ministry of Supply 1.179,600 tons and underthe Board of Trade 68,800 tons.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.20. Seventeen ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boats duringthe week and, of these, eight are known to have been sunk. Three ships (riversteamers from the Great Lakes) were sunk while in convoy in mid-Atlantic andone ship in an outward convoy to Iceland (C). In the West Atlantic, one ship was torpedoed off Newfoundland, two were sunk south-east of Trinidad and onesunk and a second torpedoed north of Para, Brazil. Two ships were torpedoedin the Freetown area, one was shelled off the north-east coast of Ceylon and threewere attacked west of Bombay, off Cochin, and in the Gulf of Oman respectively.
Enemy aircraft sank a ship west of Cape Finisterre; and a small coastaltanker was attacked by a flying-boat off the east coast of Iceland (C). A ship was torpedoed by aircraft in the Red Sea but reached Port Sudan.A total of 668 passengers and crew, including 382 service personnel, fromthe s.s. Laconia, torpedoed and sunk on the 12th, have been landed at Casablancafrom the French Cruiser Gloire, which sailed from Dakar in response to a distressmessage intercepted by a Vichy French sloop.British Minelaying.21. Aircraft laid mines daring the week in the Baltic, off the German north sea coast, and in the Channel and Bay of Biscay.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.22. Minelaying by surface craft was suspected oft&apos; the South-West Coast on one night of the week and aircraft may have laid mines off the Lizard.Anti-sweeping devices have been met with in the course of the clearance ofthe Lyme Bay area, where seven mines have been destroyed during the week.The mine totals now are : acoustic 1,318; magnetic. 2.637: moored. 1,681.Enemy Merchant Shipping.23. Seven German ships, totalling 14,392 tons, in Spanish ports have beenbought by the Spanish Government. The change of flag has not been recognised by His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Italian tankers Albaro (2,104 tons) and Celeno (3,741 tons) arrived atIstanbul on the 30th.Vichy French Intelligence.24. Reports have recently been received regarding present conditions ofservice in the Vichy Navy. It is considered that the Navy has been less affectedby the defeat in 1940 than either of the other services, and, despite restrictions imposed by the Armistice terms, conditions since have not only been maintained,but, in many instances, improved.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.(An outline map showing comparison of the German advance in Russia 1941-42is included as an inset of this Resume.)Northern Sector.25. The Russians have continued their local attacks south of Lake Ladoga,but latterly German counter-attacks have met with some success. Although thereare continued indications that a German offensive against Leningrad has been contemplated, it is doubtful whether it can take place this year.Central Sector.26. The Russians have gained ground in their sustained attacks in theRzhev area, and are now reported to hold half the town, though their lossesappear to have been heavy.Don Sector.27. Despite strong Russian attacks, the German positions at Voronezhremain substantially intact.Stalingrad Sector.28. Repeated Russian attacks against the German northern flank, stretchingfrom the Don to the Volga, have probably played a big part in so far preventing the capture of Stalingrad. Smaller Russian attacks have also been deliveredagainst the German southern flank, some 40 miles south of Stalingrad. Thenorthern part of the city is still in Russian hands, but the position elsewhere isobscure. The Germans are now probably well established in the city centre,, andmay hold&apos; a substantial part of the southern suburbs.
Caucasus Sector.29. To the east of Mozdok the Germans have made no fresh progress, butsouth-westwards of that town they have advanced some distance up the easternbank of the Upper Terek River. In the Caucasus mountains the Russianscontinue to counter-attack, with unknown results. Ground has been^ gained bythe Germans towards Tuapse and, to a smaller extent, south-east of Novorossisk,but on the 26th the Russians were still holding the heights round the latter port.Egypt.30.   Patrol activity has continued.Madagascar.31. East African troops, supported by South African armoured cars andBritish artillery, entered Tananarive, the capital of Madagascar, at mid-dayon the 23rd September. Before our entry the last French garrisons to the west of the city, including that at the airport, surrendered unconditionally. Theremainder of the French forces in. this area withdrew southwards. On the26th our forward troops captured Behenjy (approximately 20 miles south ofTananarive) after some slight resistance. They have now reached a point about50 miles south of Tananarive. Road blocks, demolitions, and now rain are holding up the advance.32. On the 29th a detachment of South African troops was landed atTulear. on the south-west coast, and occupied the town and barracks without opposition. The civilian population is friendly and co-operating with our forces. Our patrols have since advanced some 55 miles along the road runningnorth-east from the town.33. On the east of the capital our forces have made contact with the troopsadvancing from Brickaville. and the whole of the main railway line fromTamatave to Tananarive is now in our hands.Far East.South-West Pacific.34. From the 24th-28th September the position in New Guinea remainedstable, with the Japanese forces held up some 30 miles north-east of Port Moresby.On the 29th Australian forces attacked, and the Japanese, numbering 8,000 inthe forward area, withdrew some ten miles. The capture of quantities of equip-ment is claimed. Considerable reinforcements have reached the Australianforces, which now consist of three Australian Imperial Force Bdes. at the front,with two Australian Militia Force Bdes., one tk. sqn. and two U.S. Inf. Regts.(one of which was flown from Queensland) in the Port Moresby area. The forcesin the Milne Bay area consist of one A.I.F. and one A.M.F. Inf. Bde.35. Australian casualties during the operations at Milne Bay and againstthe Japanese landed at Buna total 2,070, including sick wastage. The Japanesecasualties at Milne Bay are estimated at 700, and their losses in the Kokoda-port moresby fighting at 1,300.36. The Japanese strength in the S.W. Pacific area is now estimated at the equivalent of four divisions, of which the equivalent of one division is composedof naval landing parties.South Pacific.37. The situation in the S.E. Solomons is relatively quiet. The strength ofthe Japanese on Guadalcanal Island is now estimated at 4,000.38. The High Commissioner for the Western Pacific has reported enemy occupation of the remaining islands of the Gilbert Islands Group. A JapaneseCommissioner is already reported to be functioning at Tarawa, the capital of thegroup.Intelligence.France and the Low Countries.39. It is now known that 23 German Inf. Div., which arrived recently onthe borders of France and Belgium, is in the area of Ypres.   It was included in
the total of 34 divisions in France and the Low Countries mentioned in lastweek s Resume. 320 Inf. Div. has been identified at Cherbourg. It was formerlyin the Dunkirk area, where its place is believed to have been taken by anotherdivision, at present unidentified. There are indications that a further divisionhas arrived in the Rotterdam area. If this is confirmed, it will bring the strengthup to five divisions in the Low Countries and the total to 35 in France and theLow Countries.AIR SITUATION.General Review.40.   Our  offensive  against  land  targets  in   Germany  was   suspendedthroughout the week owing to persistent bad weather.Tobruk Harbour was heavily bombed by night.United Kingdom.41. Fighter Command flew 958 defensive sorties by day (including 20 by .S. aircraft) and 300 by night.Harassing raids on a somewhat heavier scale were made in daylight on theSouth Coast and over East Anglia; a total of 58 enemy aircraft flew overland.An attack was made on Hastings by 20 Me. 109s, whilst about 15 more fighters were seen just off the coast acting as a withdrawal cover for the attacking force.Do. 217s operating singly made roof-top attacks on Colchester and Broadstairs.At night only 13 bombers were reported overland.Four enemy aircraft were destroyed, two were probably destroyed and fourothers damaged.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.42. Fighter and Bomber Commands despatched 119 and ten offensive sorties respectively compared with 55 and 33 last week. In addition, 79 sorties were flown by US. fighters and 62 by U.S. bombers.A determined low-level attack was made by four Mosquito bombers on the gestapo Headquarters at Oslo. The raid was timed to disorganise a NorwegianNazi Party rally and was carried out successfully; photographs show that thebuilding was hit (see Appendix VII). One of the Mosquitos was shot down overthe target.Other projected operations were cancelled or. owing to deterioration inweather, were not completed.   Casualties are set out in Appendix VI.Aircraft of the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit and of Army Co-opera-tion Command flew a total of 48 photographic sorties.Night.43.   No offensive operations were possible against land targets.44.

The above table is an aggregation of the material in the employment tables of non-tankers and tankers in Statistical Digests E and F respectively. in combining the figures for non-tankers with those for tankers, certain slight differences have had to be brought into a common form. The figures for non-tankers relateto the last day of the month while those for tankers relate to the 15th of the month to February 1942 and to the last day of the month from March 1942.(1) (a) Tankers on Admiralty service include vesseds importing oil fuel to the United Kingdom; in August 1942 these comprised 35 tankers of 272,000 gross tons.(b) Non-tankers allocated to the fighting services which are under repair are excluded from this column.   All tankers on Admiralty service are, however, included.(c) A substantial part (in recent months nearly one-half) of the tonnage in these columns brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage (see note (3)).(2) These columns give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair. They do not,therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (s.part from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward voyages to     ^Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries other than United Kingdom and Eire.

At the Rhein Preussen mines the outputfell from 12,000 to 9,000 tons per day due almost entirely to damage to the workers&apos; dwellings in the neighbourhood.(b) Because of damage caused to blast furnaces the Germans have now given instructions that blast furnaces at two places in France which hadbeen partially idle must resume operations to their full capacity, thenecessary materials being supplied.(c) At the time the bomb hit the main station at dusseldorf an express had just arrived and 50 passengers, including some leading industrialists,were killed.Cologne.The following reports refer to damage resulting from the 1,000 bomberattack : (a) The depot at Bremen has received no spare parts for diesel engines fromHumboldt Deutz since the &quot; 1,000&quot; attack.
