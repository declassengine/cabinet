(42)  43125TH SEPTEMBER.  1943,COPY NO.WAR CABINETFIRST REPORT OP THE public accounts COMMITTED,  1942Memorandum by the Chancellor of the :acchequer1.     It seems likely that it will be necessary to arrangean early debate on the first report of the Public accounts committee for 1942,      This report covers the Committee1sspecial investigation of certain contract    cases which arousedmuch criticism in the House when the report of the comptroller and Auditor General was published earlier this year.      Thematter was before the War Cabinet on 13th July (W.M.9l(42),Item 5), when the Public Accounts Committee report was about to bepublished.      The War Cabinet may now wish to be reminded of themain points in the report,to learn what action has been taken bythe. Departments concerned, and to consider what linos should betaken by Government speakers in the debate.2.      I attach a list of the cases, with short notes of the mainfindings of the Committee on each, and of the action taken by theDepartments.      Three supply Departments are concerned - theAdmiralty,  the Ministry of Supply and the Ministry of aircraft production.      It seems probable that most of the criticism islikely to fasten on two cases,  the British Thompson HoustonCompany (Ministry of Supply)  and, particularly,  the BritishManufacture and Research Company (Ministry of Aircraft Production)of which Mr. Dennis Kendall, 17.P. , is Managing Director.Criticism may be directed both to the behaviour of the firms concerned, and also to the departmental handling of the contracts in question.5.      It will be for the Ministers concerned to deal withparticular questions arising on the contracts for which they areresponsible.      I shall be ready of course to answer on anygeneral questions of contract procedure and policy, if that should,be necessary.4.     The Chief Whip is considering the questions of procedureinvolved, e.g. whether the debate should be on a specificmotion or on the adjournment*(Intd.) K.W.Treasury Chambers.26TH SEPTEMBER,  1942.

TheCommittee state thatthere was, in fact, no restriction   ofproduction by this flm,but they add that acontractor should recognise that in war-time their negotiatingmethods ought   not toplace a Department insuch a position thattheir negotiators fear that the country&apos;sneeds may not bo supplieunless they give way tothe claims upon thorn.Action taken by departments [The earlier contracts towhich tho Committeo refersare fixed price contracts and cannot bo reopened. h.f urthor- f ixod^prico &quot;con-tjact placed in 1942 isvery close&quot; to tho lowestprioo obtained for theses-bores froraiany.other . nCrvn3-,\*asvfcn&quot; 6ncr is considerecby .&apos;tho Ministry&quot; to be onewhich is not liKely to yield more than areasonable rate of profit.As regards the latestcontract (August, 1942)this will not be at a fixed price.    the contractor has agreedthat it shall be a costedcontract at a maximum--.133100. with a fixedprofit (within-themaximum price) perinstrument supplied.Ministryof SupplySolex Ltd.MinistrySupplyof PlikingtonBros.The firm has no propercostings system, and while t; o Committeefind this surprisingthey agree that thereare difficulties ininstituting a detailedcosting system and see no objection to thealternative steps whichthe Ministry of Supplyare taking to control the profits.The Committee are satis-fied that this firmhaye at all times been willing to meet therequirements of theMinistry and have rediic-ed prices when costshave fallen. They have nodoubt that it will bepossible to arrive at areasonable settlement with the firm. ^This easeattracted specialcriticism in tho house,because of the magnitude of the profit for the year1939-40 disclosed in the comptroller and AccountantGeneral&apos;s report/negotiations on the termson which supplies willbe forthcoming during t^eyear 1942 are still inprogress, and asatisfactory conclusion is expected.The latest accounts arenow available to theDepartment&apos;s investigatorsand investigationsconcerning the costs ofsupplies are proceeding.

Department     FirmCommittee&apos;s FindingsAction taken by Dopts.Ministry ofAircraftProduction(and &quot;In,of Supply).&quot;D. are,however, thenegotiatingDept.)British       l.In relation to onelinfg. &amp; contract (which wasResearch       entered into beforeCo.Ltd. tho outbreak of war)the Company gavetho impression tothe Ministry thatthey would not deliverguns to the Air Min.until a price had been fixed.    In fact, therewas no restriction ofproduction or failure to deliver;    but theCommittee feel ncdoubt that the officersof the Air Ministry incharge of thenegotiations wereinfluenced in concludinga price by the urgentdesire to secure iraraed-iate deliveries..All prices, whether fixedor provisional, for supplies of guns andshells during the years1940 and 1941 are reopened.The now prices are settled on the basis ofactual coats plus profitat the r ate of 4^o on cost for 1940 and on cost for 1941.    On this basis the total profitsfor 1940 and 1941respectively will be 38.745,  and  51,600on a cost of sales of 861,000 and  1,474/000.For the two years &quot;to-gether this is a profit of about  90,000 as contrasted with profits on t^-pricesoriginally -8at.tlod(.iiost ofi which are provisional)ofover2. A verbal understanding!which tho Ministrythought they had securedwith the Company in negotiation was notincorporated in the formal contract terms.The Committee describedthis as a regrettableerror which is excusedby the conditionsarising out of theevacuation of the Dept.from London, The Committeeadd that the Company&apos;transaction in not implement-ing this understanding-except as part of ageneral settlement ofother guestions is mostregrettable.The Committee find thatthroughout thediscussions with this company during 1959/40and 41 tho Ministryexperienced difficultiesin securing all theinformation that they considered necessary.The Committee; 1,500,000. some of which,however, was subject toadjustment in any event.Tho not profit to theCompany for the years1958 to 1941 aftertaxation and expenditureof  11,000 not allowed in costs will now be 509,.0GL.. During this period the Company have produced10,500 guns, plus 9 million rounds of shell.As part of the general settlement the ministry will purchase from theCompany at cost lessdepreciation certaincapital assets previouslyprovided by the Co.for the purpose of extending their capacity.Other ancillary matters are still under negotiation.
