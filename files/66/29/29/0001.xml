From the military point of view we agree withGeneral Wavell that there would be no objection to theproposal, but we see no great advantage in it.3.

ANNEX    ICopy of a telegram No.23796/C dated 27th Septemberfrom C. &quot;in-C*,   India5  to C.I.G.S._General  ibort. Stilwells representative at Delhiinformed me yesterday that Generalissimo disappointedat number of Chinese troops who had reached India from burma proposed to send additional 8000 or more by air tobe equipped from American Lease-Lend stores in India andto be trained at Ramgarh with remainder.Two.      I said there would be no difficulty aboutaccommodation up to limit of Ramgarh camp but that i could supply no equipment or transport.Three.     Do not know how far proposal likely tomaterialise as air transport -unlikely to be available.Prom military point of view I have no objection solong as I do not have to provide equipment or transport and well trained Chinese force might be possible assetin reoccupation of Burma..Four.     Do not know if ohere are any political implications behind request.     Force would presumablybe token of Chinese intention to continue strugglealongside India but might be embarrassment in some respects.     Presume Ambassador will inform ForeignOffice and Government of India if proposal likely tobe carried out.      Have informed Viceroy of request.T.0,0.    1000 GMT.C.6 (Tels).

a JL2LJL JL&amp;DRAFT T3LEGRAM,Prom:   War Office3To:       Commander--in-Chief, India,Repeated to Joint Staff Mission, &quot;Washington, and h.M. M inister f Chungking aProm C3I,G.S. to General Y.ravell*Your No-. 23796/C of 27th September,     We understandthat on purely military aspect you     e no particularadvantage in acceptance of proposal.-.    There are some political disadvantages but these are outweighed byconsideration that flat rejection of the proposal by us would be likely to have an unfortunate effect on ourrelations not only with China, but also the United States0It would be misrepresented as a further refusal of Chinesemilitary assistance and the resulting propaganda put out bythe Chinese in the United States might have seriousconsequences02*       Our response to the offer should therefore beostensibly a warm acceptance,    But we should at the same timepoint out all the practical difficulties of executing a project which may be very great and may not have been fullyconsideredo    These difficulties are mainly for the UnitedStates authorities and if on examination of them they decide to persuade Chiang-Kai-Shek to withdraw suggestion that wouldbo best solution.3*     With this object you should, if you agree, inform Sibertthat we welcome the suggestion as a contribution to the solidarity or? the United Nations and are prepared to acceptproposal in principle, although we cannot ourselves providetransport or equipment for the additional Chinese troops,Por reasons of space at Ramgarh it would also be necessaryto limit the total number to 20 ,0001   We foresee,however,

certain practical difficulties and before the proposal is approved and put into effect v/o should like 3tilwcll&apos;views on the following points(a) From information available here of capacity ofexisting air transport at disposal of ,.r,iericans move of chinese would cover considerable period even using availableaircraft fullest capacity,(b) 7/e are not aware how Americans could augment numbersof transport aircraft in view of their accepted commitmentunder Arnold-Portal agreement to build up air transportgroups in United Kingdom, Middle Hast/India.( c)   ;.rould not transport of Chinese troops to Indiahold up deliveries of Chinese exports o,g. wolfram, tin andsilk to their destinations?    In tZiis connection diversion of shipping capacity to meet those commitments from elsewhere at expcr.se of deliveries of war materials to united Kingdom, Kiddle liast and India would be unacceptable to British Government,(d) Presume Americans have considered implications of intensive large scale air transport movement ex-China onsmall stocks of aviation spirit available in China,   Wecannot see how expenditure could be balanced by import ofcased petrol to China by air,(e) If Americans undertake to equip and maintainthese Chinese with all needs we presume this would be donowithout diversion shipping capacity and supplies war materialat present allotted to British theatres of war.k$       You should add that wc assume Stilwoll with refer theabove points to Washington with a view&apos;their considerationby the Combined Chiefs.of Staff,.5*       For your own information we are assuming that com-paratively few Chinese troops will be sufficiently equipped and trained to take part in any operations against Japanesein campaigning season 19h2-h3.    Question of operational 0011-trol of Chinese will presumably be settled to yoursatisfaction with Stilwell when the time comes.
