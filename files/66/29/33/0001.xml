Clark Kerr has informed me that the notes were exchanged by M. Molotovand himself on the 29th September.2. Agreement in principle to conclude such an arrangement was reachedduring the Prime Minister&apos;s visit to Moscow in August.3. It is important that the three Service Departments and also all other government Departments concerned should bear in mind that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are bound by this undertaking, so that the communication to theSoviet Government of all technical information of real importance is notoverlooked. Similarly, it is important that all Government Departmentsconcerned should be aware of the terms of this undertaking in order that requestsmay be addressed to the Soviet Government for the communication by them ofany technical information likely to be of value to us.4. I should, therefore, be grateful if my colleagues would take the necessary steps to ensure that their Departments are made fully aware of the terms of theAgreement in question.5. The United States Government have been kept informed through mr.. Harriman, and the Dominions Governments should no doubt also beinformed of the conclusion of the Agreement. But in view of the importance which the Soviet Government attach to secrecy in matters of this kind, I would propose that it should not be communicated to the other Allied Governments,and should be treated as secret.A. E.Foreign Office, October 8, 1942.11871   [24461]
