Labour shortage, indeed, appearsto have become a bottleneck about one year earlier in Germany than in GreatBritain, largely, no doubt, because the German programme of plant extensionin the armaments industries was completed well before our own.Labour Mobilisation.2. A comparison of the distribution of the populations of Great Britainand Germany is a matter of difficulty owing to the lack of precisely comparableGerman statistics.   Other complications are (a) The presence of numerous foreign workers in Germany.(b) The inclusion in the category of &quot; occupied &quot; of the wives of peasantfarmers. In order to make the German and British figures compar-able, the estimated number of farmers&apos; wives in Germany whosehusbands are working at home is included in the unoccupied category.The table below gives estimates of the numbers and the percentage distribu-tion of Germans (men 14-64; women 14-59) in various occupations in mid-1939and spring 1942, together with similar figures for Great Britain. The Germanfigures cover native Germans only and exclude foreign civilian workers and prisoners of war, 0-5 million and 4-6 million of which are estimated to havebeen employed in Germany at the tw^o dates, and of which 0-4 million and2-6 million were engaged in agriculture. The German figure for armed forces, &amp;c,-includes net battle casualties estimated at approximately 2 million in the spring of 1942.Distribution of Adult Population.(Men 14-64 : Women 14-59.) 	&apos;    mid-1939.				spring 1942.				great britain.		germany.		great britain.		germany.		millions.	per cent,	millions.	per gent.	millions.	per cent.	millions.	per cent.1. armed forces, &amp;c....... 2. munitions         ......	6-6 3-3	1-7 10-3	5-3	O   i-f O &quot; 1 9-8	4-4 5-0	13-7 15-5	12-0 5-3	22-2 9-8total of 1 and 2...... 3. other essential industries ... 4. other industries        ...      ... 5. all others............	3-9 5-9 10-0 12-3	12-0 18-4 31-3 38-3	7-3 13-6 14-4 18-9	13-5 24-s 26-5 35-2	9-4. 5-5 6-9 10-2	29-2 17-3 21-5 32-0	17-3 12-7 7-0 17-0	32-0 23-5 13-0 31-5	32-1    j 100-0		54-2      100-0 i		32	100-0	54-0	100-notes.2.   include motal, chemical, engineering and allied trades.3. include national and local Government, public utilities, transport, mining, food and agriculture .   &quot; all others &quot; includo all those not gainfully occupied, domestic servants and swstudents.30[24468]
Available information does not permit of an analysis of the German figuresby sexes, but even after allowance is made for farmers&apos; wives the proportionof adult women occupied in Germany in 1939 was considerably higher than inGreat Britain. In the three years 1939-42 the additional numbers of adultwomen mobilised were only 300,000, but to these might be added the 1-2 millionfarmers&apos; wives whose husbands have been called up, and who are thereforeassumed to have become occupied.3. The comparison of the British and German percentage distributions inthe spring of 1942 within the age groups considered brings out the followingdifferences u (a) The   proportion   engaged   in   &quot; munitions &quot;   in   Great   Britain   is substantially greater than in Germany for the following reasons : (i) Work on capital construction in the armaments industries isstill continuing in Great Britain but has largely ceased inGermany.(ii) The British army is on the average more highly equipped.(iii) The British naval and air forces which use highly specialisedequipment are comparatively much larger.(iv) &quot; Munitions&quot; industries in  Great  Britain probably providefor a greater proportion of civilian requirements (iron andsteel, engineering, &amp;c).(v) Armaments design in Germany tends to be simpler than inGreat Britain.(vi) Germany has fewer types of armaments than Great Britain, and changes them less frequently.(b) The proportion engaged in (i other essential industries&quot; in germany is considerably larger than in Great Britain owing to the largenumbers engaged in agriculture.(c) The proportion engaged in &apos;&apos; other industries &apos;&apos; is much smaller inGermany. It was smaller in 1939 : since then Germany has reduced the number of persons so engaged by 50 per cent., while GreatBritain has reduced them by only 30 per cent.(d) The proportion not occupied is very similar in the two countries (makingdue allowance for farmers&apos; wives in Germany).The contrast between the task of the labour forces in the two countries&apos;is seen if those in the armed forces and those engaged in agriculture are excluded.Germany has approximately 20^ million workers aided by 2 million foreignersto provide for all military and civil needs other than food; Great Britain hasapproximately 16^ million. Thus a German labour force only 37 per cent,greater than the British (and of which 10 per cent, are foreigners) supplies allthe needs, except food, of armed forces more than 130 per cent, greater and a civilian population 75 per cent, greater than our own.This takes no account of imports into either country; but there is little doubtthat in commodities other than foodstuffs Great Britain receives from overseassubstantially greater assistance (in terms of man hours) than does Germany from her allies, and vassels and from European neutrals. Thus this factor, though itcannot be accurately assessed, does not help to explain the disparity in the fore-&apos; going figures, but, on the contrary, renders it greater.Reductions in Civilian Stipjylies.4. Already by mid-1941 Germany had accomplished a high degree oflabour mobilisation for the forces, for munitions and for essential industries and services. Its speed must be largely attributed to the very drastic reductions which were made in the provision of consumers&apos; goods and services. Furtherspecial measures have been taken in 1942 (which will be described below), but thechief reductions in consumption were part of the general plan for war economicmobilisation. In clothing, household goods and furnishings, transport services,medical and dental services, besides all goods and services other than necessariesof life, the reduction in consumption in Germany compared with pre-war was, bythe end of 1941, greater than it yet is in this country, although precise measure-ment is not possible.The adverse effects of these reductions in civilian supplies have been reducedby a social policy designed to reconcile, so far as possible, the need to maintain
the stamina of productive workers with the need to maintain the morale of thepopulation as a whole.(a) Not only was rationing introduced on a wide scale early in the war, butdifferential rationing enabled special classes of the population to obtain bettersupplies than others. The clearest example of differential rationing is to be foundin the provision of high food rations to heavy workers, and, on the other hand, ofspecial rations to children and expectant mothers. The same basic principleextends to the provision of most other goods.(b) Care was taken to provide ample financial assistance to those who wereeconomically hit by the war e.g., businesses forced to close down, dependants of men called up to the forces, &amp;c. This comparative liberality in financial matters was made possible by the strict control of consumption and production which prevented inflationary tendencies. Its psychological effects were certainlymost beneficial and there is ample evidence that the German population isappreciative of what is regarded as the most socially just method of distributingthe burdens of war.&quot;Factory Leave.&quot;5. An important aspect of German labour j^policy has been the acceptanceof the principle that &quot; factory leave &quot; i.e., the temporary release of men fromthe forces to industry-is both practicable and also desirable from the point ofview of economising man-power. It has sometimes been srated that Germar.labour strategy during this war has been to use men as soldiers in the summer and as munition workers in the winter to prepare for the campaigns of thefollowing summer. Although such a crude description exaggerates the import-ance of factory leave, it is true that in the winter of 1940--41 especially,considerable numbers of men, particularly skilled men, were released for industrial work.There is evidence that the Germans were not able to do this in the winter of1941-42, partly because they were heavily engaged on the front, but also because it proved more satisfactory to repair damaged tanks, aircraft, &amp;c, on the spot asfar as possible rather than to send them back to the factories together with thenecessary labour. The German High Command appears to have accepted theprinciple that army tradesmen should be freely drafted back to industrial jobswhenever their services in the army could be dispensed with.Agricultural leave is also granted to some extent, but appears to be considerably less^important than.factory leave.Recent Measures.6. The foregoing measures, together with others, such as concentration ofproduction, control of materials anl labour, where British and German methodshave been on similar lines, were part of Germany&apos;s original war mobilisationplans. At the beginning of 1942, however, further measures were introducedwhen it was realised that still greater economies in man-power would be necessaryin the face of the prolonged Russian campaign and the need to compete withgrowing British and American war production. They cover a very wide field and, in effect, constitute a thorough-going reorganisation of the wholeGerman war economy. The most important of them can be summarised asfollows : (a) Civilian supplies were further restricted, more, perhaps, by limiting thenumber of kinds of articles produced than by quantitative reduction.(b) Production  was  further. concentrated, in  the  most  efficient  firms.Essential repairs in these firms were carried out, and these repairswere given high priority in labour and raw materials supply. At thesame time, machines of closed-down firms were made available to thosestill in production.&quot;(c) Steps were taken to compel firms to -reveal to their competitors secretprocesses and methods of production wherever war productionrequired this.(d) Concessions were made to businesses in respect of excess profit taxes.  Atthe same time, the pricing of public contracts on a cost-plus system was abandoned for a modified single-price system, which was ofconsiderable advantage to the lowest cost producers.(e) A number of simplifications were introduced in the tax system, in theallocation of raw materials and in the organisation of public and semi-public bodies.
(/) Great stress was laid on the importance of &quot; self-administration &quot; in business and less on bureaucratic control.(g) Closer co-ordination was established between the Armed Forces, theProduction Departments and the producers themselves.Summary.7. The mobilisation of the German war . economy shows the followingcharacteristics : (a) The shift from less essential to more essential occupations has been muchgreater than in this country, though the proportion of unoccupiedadults is no less.(&amp;) Adverse effects of drastic cuts in civilian consumption have been reducedby differential rationing and by liberal allowances to those hard hit by the war.(c) Labour, particularly skilled labour, has been economised by the granting of &apos;&apos; factory leave &apos;&apos; which the High Command recognises to be bothpracticable and desirable.(d) Concentration of production has been ruthlessly carried out in theinterests of efficiency, although financial compensation has beenliberal. At the same time efficient firms have received importantE.P.T. concessions.(e) Existing administrative procedure and taxation methods have beenscrapped wherever a saving of personnel could thus be brought about.- -; &apos; . -      s.   &apos;Ministry of Economic Warfare,October 9, 1942.
