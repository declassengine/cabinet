It is a backwardProvince with only one flourishing city (Karachi).   its financial resources eire slender and its politics peculiar to itself.   For several months a considerable part of the -Province has been under martial law during the operationsconducted by British forces against the Hurs, the followersof the Pir pagaro, a fanatical Moslem chieftain who hasterrorised the countryside.The present prime Minister, Khan Bahadur Allah Bakhsh,0.3..3. , is a Moslem but not a member of the Lo si em League.Neither is he a member of Congress.   But his Ministrydepends for its existence on the support of the; Congressmembers in the Legislature.   He is an adroit politician,hitherto he has behaved more or less satisfactorily ana has given reasonable support to the war effort.   Last week,however, he sent the Viceroy a letter, which he subsequentlypublished in the local press, declaring his disappointmentwith the policy of Great Britain who evidently &quot;had no desire to give up her imperialistic hold on India&quot;andrenouncing his 0.3.2. and his title of Khan Bahadur- (conferred by the Viceroy) which he &quot;cannot but regard as-tokens of British imperialism&quot;.Although no final decision has yet been taken, the.Viceroy feels that this deliberate and public affront to theCrown and the King&apos;s representative in India cannot be passed by and that the Governor has really no choice but to dismiss the premier.    Fortunately the Governor apprehends nodifficulty in forming an alternative Ministry to carry on for the time being though he is doubtful whether it couldsuccessfully face the Legislature in the budget session .&amp;&amp;rly next year,    Should it fail it would be necessary forthe Governor to take the administration into his own handsunder section 93 of the Government of India ^ct. a courseconstitutionally retrograde but likely to be beneficial tothe administration of the Province.I have no doubt that my colleagues will agree as to the undesirability of retaining in office a prime Minister whohas committed such an impropriety: and I have informed theViceroy that he may count on my support if it provesnecessary to dismiss Allah Bakhsh.L * bINDIA OPT ICE.30 September 1942.
