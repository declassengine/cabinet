THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMl?fN&apos;r     -Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1942.SECRET.W.P. (42) 436.September 29, 1942.WAR CABINET.AIR SERVICES TO THE MIDDLE EAST.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.AT a meeting of the War Cabinet on the 25th August, I was invited to submit a scheme for providing the additional aircraft required to enable a firm allocation of 6,000 lbs. a week to be made as from the end of this month for the carriage of mails for troops in the Middle East, and to explain what diversions from otherair services would thereby be involved.As I stated in my paper of the 25th July (W.P. (42) 315), I have been able to achieve the target figure of 14,000 lbs. per week which was set me by the ad hoc committee on the Air Service to the Middle East (see their Report of the29th June (W.P. (42) 275)), but only at the expense of overworking the existingB.O.A.C. fleet. This process cannot go on for ever, especially as many of the flying-boats are already several years old. Recently we have lost Clare, leavingonly two &quot; C &quot; Class Boats on the African route. Moreover, the target figure has risen to 16,000 lbs. this month and will rise again to^O-jOOfr lbs. in December and / Iff, Oooto 25,000 lbs. next March.Accordingly, if I am to guarantee the fulfilment of the programme set me inJune, the B.O.A.C. fleet must be reinforced, and I have decided to allocate forthis purpose 6 Sunderland flying-boats and 14 Warwick land planes. While itnaturally goes against the grain to withhold aircraft from operationalCommands, there is no alternative open to me in present circumstances. I should add that the loss to Coastal Command, as compared with the loss to bomber command; is less than it would be under a strict application of the 2 :3 ratioproposed by the Prime Minister at the Cabinet Meeting on the 25th August.The Sunderlands and Warwicks will not be ready for service in their newrole before, at least, the New Year. Moreover, they are required, as explained above, to ensure the fulfilment of the existing programme. In these circum-stances, other aircraft must be found for the new commitment approved by theWar Cabinet on the 25th August.I have reviewed the possibilities and have decided to increase the strengthof No. 1425 Flight, Royal Air Force, which is responsible for the operation ofthe Liberator transport service from the United Kingdom to the Middle Eastvia Gibraltar, by allotting to it two additional Liberator IPs which were ear-marked as backing for the two Liberator squadrons in India. These aircraft will be ready for service at the end of this month.Three months ago, the aircraft establishment of 1425 Flight was threeLiberators. With this equipment they maintained an average of one flight tothe Middle East every twelve days carrying 3,750 lbs. per flight or a total of9,375 lbs. per month. Two months ago two more Liberators were allocated to it but full advantage has not yet been derived from the increased fleet as oneLiberator was immediately diverted for use in connexion with the PrimeMinisters visit to Moscow and was unserviceable for some time after that in theMiddle East, and another had an accident at Gibraltar, where it still is.[24409]
With seven Liberators, 1425 Flight will be able, if unservieeability andweather conditions are not abnormal, to do an average of one flight every third day to the Middle East, i.e., ten flights a month. As the average payload of theR.A.F. Liberators on this route has now been increased to 5,000 lbs. per flight,it. is hoped that 1425 Flight will be able to carry 50,000 lbs. per month to Egypt.The increased carrying capacity of 1425 Flight makes it possible for me toundertake that 6,000 lbs. of troop mail will be carried as from the end of thismonth all the way by air to the Middle East, but I cannot accept the obligationthat&apos; it should all be taken by the direct route through the Mediterranean unlessthe War Cabinet rules that troop mail is in all circumstances to have absolute priority over, for instance, urgent tank and aircraft spares, specialist and high-ranking officers and other military traffic. The alternative, which is the course recommend, is that the Priorities Board should be allowed to decide week by \ &quot;week in the light of changing circumstances what traffic should be sent by the direct route and what via West Africa. At present, all troop mails for the middle east are taken by the B.O.A.C. service via West Africa.Traffic sent by 1425 Flight reaches the Middle East a couple of days afterdeparture from this country, and that sent by West Africa 7 to 10 days later.Before the new commitment in respect of troop mails, the target figureslaid down by the War Cabinet for the carriage of traffic all the way by air to theMiddle East were as follows : September 1942......      ......      16,000 lbs. per week.   .December 1942 ......      ......    A40,00e lbs. per week. A /KCaoMarch 1943      ............      25,000 lbs. per week.Of this, 1,600 lbs. was for troop mail.  The revised figures will now be : October 1942............      20,400 lbs. per week.December 1942 ............      28,400 lbs. per week.March 1943      ............      29,400 lbs. per week.The First Lord has been consulted and is in agreement with these proposals.A. H. M. S.September 29, 1942.
