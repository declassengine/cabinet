(42) 426.September 23, 1942.WAR CABINET.SUPPORT FOR GENERAL DE GAULLE IN FRANCE ANDVICHY COLONIES.Note by the Secretary.THE annexed Memorandum, by the Chairman of the Committee on french resistance, is circulated by direction of the Prime Minister.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES.Great George Street, S. W. 1,September 23, 1942.1. Nature of Enquiry.By direction of the Prime Minister I have studied evidence put at mydisposal on the degree of support for General de Gaulle in France and VichyColonies. In reaching the following conclusions, I have regarded the questionof French support for the Americans or for ourselves as lying outside the termsof my enquiry, and have tried to set aside any knowledge of present british policy.2. Meaning of &quot; support for &quot; de Gaulle.&apos;&apos; Support for&apos;&apos; de Gaulle means different things to different Frenchmen at different times. The extent of their support for him varies with their thought of him as a symbol of resistance, as a military chief or as a political leader.Unless helped to clear their own minds, Frenchmen often confuse the issue by giving a false impression of their attitude when they really support de Gaullein one capacity, but condemn him in another. A further source of confusion isthe term &quot; Gaullismc,&quot; purposely applied by Vichy and the Germans to any sort of resistance to collaboration. &quot;Gaullisme&quot; is not necessarily &quot; deGaullisme.&quot;A majority of the French people support de Gaulle as a symbol of their owndesire to see French soil cleared of the enemy, though there is a new tendency to substitute the Croix de Lorraine for the person of de Gaulle. Some who declaretheir disapproval of de Gaulle now wear this symbol. A recovery in morale isgiving rise to a feeling that Frenchmen who have suffered alongside the majorityof their countrymen must regain their liberty by their own efforts.&quot;Were Frenchmen sure that de Gaulle, or for that matter any other potentialleader, had no ulterior personal motive, but was devoted solely to the task of driving the enemy out of France, they would rally behind him almost to a man.As it is, few Frenchmen believe this of de Gaulle, or of any other candidate forleadership.On the other hand, no Frenchman, unless committed to work for an Axisvictory, would approve should the British seem to abandon de Gaulle or hisMovement. On the contrary, there is the strongest evidence that such an actwould alienate French sympathy for Great Britain even more sharply than wouldour sinking the French warships at Alexandria, drowning their crews,   [24382]
3. Support for de Gaulle as a symbol.Support for de Gaulle as a symbol of resistance varies in different districts.The nearer the German the greater de Gaulle&apos;s popularity is a general rule. this does not imply that where de Gaulle is popular his supporters are better organisedor are ready to give him active help. To cry for de Gaulle is one thing; to diefor him, another. Over 30 million Frenchman and women might shout &apos;&apos; Vivede Gaulle.&quot; It would be very surprising if anything like 30 thousand wouldtake a serious risk to do that.De Gaulle is most popular in Occupied France. However, even inBrittany, where resistance is solid and courage high, he has failed to create either a para-military or a political organisation.   Aware of this, though unwilling to jadmit it, de Gaulle has recently concentrated upon improving his contacts inVichy France, where his symbolic value is far less than in Occupied Territory.   -In Vichy France, German and Vichy propaganda, together with the risein morale already mentioned, have reduced passive enthusiasm for de Gaulle.On the other hand, these same factors have developed a readiness in certain circlesto consider collaboration with him.The degree of approval for de Gaulle is not the same in Morocco, Algeria andTunis. Broadly speaking, civilians in Algeria, whether French or native, areanti-de Gaulle, fearing lest he force them back into a war they wish to forget.The same is true of French West Africa. There is some sympathy for de Gaullein Morocco. It is doubtful, however, if. civilian opinion counts for much. in north Africa the Army holds the power and despises the French colonial. TheArmy does not approve of de Gaulle as a symbol of resistance.4. Support for de Gaulle as a Military Commander.There is good first-hand evidence that the Armee de VArmistice, the AirForce and the Navy give no support to de Gaulle as a military or political leader.They look on themselves as the Armed Forces of France. Their Generals andAdmirals jealously guard that position. If there be question of a temporarymilitary dictatorship, it is the senior officers now in France who intend toform it.Junior officers and men will follow the orders of their own chiefs in action for or against de Gaulle of his Forces, despite some real admiration for de gaulle&apos;s coiirage and initiative. .Officers and men now on the Reserve are more favourable to de Gaulle than are those serving. Were they to be reincorporatecl into the Vichy Forces ommobilisation, they might affect the attitude of the whole. The reverse is more likely, save in the circumstance, regarded as impossible by most officers, that theForces should be mobilised to resist an xAllied landing in Occupied France. Werethis to happen great confusion would result.The attitude of the Navy is the same everywhere, but that of the Army andAir Force in Africa may differ a little from that of the Forces in Vichy France. ;Evidence suggests that there is some real support for de Gaulle in the Army inMorocco, though it is doubtful if it would materialise in action. The Army inAlgeria, reinforced by Vichy troops from Syria, is openly hostile to de gaulle and to the Fighting French. ,At the same time, recent information indicates that the Generals now at thehead of the French Army recognise power in the name of de Gaulle. They are reported to contemplate offering him a post as their chief military representativewith the Allies in the eyent of a, successful. Allied landing in Occupied France.What other inducement they have to offer or what de Gaulle will be asked inreturn is. as yet unknown.5.   Support for de Gaxdle as a Political Leader.There are no effective political organisations in Occupied France. There isno organised following for de Gaulle, in North Africa. In West Africa,Governor Boisson and his staff are hostile to de Gaulle.In Vichy France political organisations are far too many, while their effective membership is not what their leaders claim. Were men free to make public speeches or to print their views, some of these potential political leaderswould gain a following. Meanwhile, having collected a few friends, they poseas already representing the views of many; The more important anti-Vichy.Associations calculate their political supporters by the circulation of their illegalnewspapers. This is misleading if support, is to be interpreted as readiness toact.   Trades Union officials have no full record of their members, and cannot
canvas the views of those they know. Yet they do not hesitate to number their followers by highly questionable statistics and to pledge this stage army to action.Nevertheless, these various leaders of political bodies, especially the betterdisciplined, as are the Communists, can probably depend on a certain followingwhich future events might swell. The present value to de Gaulle of their supportmay be little, but it should not be dismissed as inconsiderable. Future eventsmay enhance its value.Some of these potential political figures now conclude that effective resistance to collaboration is impossible without a suitable figurehead. In their opinion,no one inside or outside France possesses the necessary popular appeal, wxcept perhaps de Gaulle. They know little of his real political views. There is,therefore, a growing tendency to negotiate with him. If they can bind him to terms, they may agree to give him their active support.The evidence available on this new tendency suggests that de Gaulle has sofar enjoyed a partial, but only a partial, success. Various emissaries havevisited him, but it is uncertain what advice they have subsequently given to thosewho sent them. There is reason to believe that not all have been satisfied,especially those of the extreme Left. De Gaulle may have other irons in the fire.He is certainly trying to use these men, as they are hoping to use him. Again,he may merely be playing his political cards ineptly. The movement is of toorecent growth to assess its real effect.6.   Final Conclusions.The following final conclusions are submitted : (i) Although Axis and. Vichy propaganda, together with a rise in homemorale, has tended to reduce his popular appeal in Vichy France,General de Gaulle still retains the support of a considerable majorityof the French people as a symbol of their desire to see the Axis drivenout of French territory. This is important in helping to maintainFrench morale, but so long as it stops short of readiness to give activehelp to the Fighting French, its practical value to General de Gaulleor to the Allies is limited,(ii) General de Gaulle has so far failed to obtain substantial support in occupied or Unoccupied France as a Military Commander, Para-military Chief or Political Leader; but it is not yet impossible for him to gain political support from certain groups, principally of the left. His claim already to have a considerable political followingin Vichy France cannot be accepted : it is, however, true that he has begun to negotiate with some potential political leaders. It is also reported that the French General Staff, with whom General de Gaullehas been trying to get into touch, without our knowledge, may not. nowrefuse to hear what he has to say.(iii) General de Gaulle&apos;s future in French public life will depend largely onrelations between himself and the Generals at the head of the french army, who will probably control the military and the immediatepolitical situation when the time for action comes. These Generals,whoever they may be, will probably be ready to accept general de Gaulle&apos;s co-operation if they think it of value to their own plans.At present the most they are likely to offer him is a post as their representative with the Allied Armies. They will not offer him aHigh Command of French Forces. Their acceptance of him at a later date as a political leader in France will depend largely on the politicalsupport he can obtain outside the Army, and to no small extent onthe support given him meanwhile by the British and american governments. *&quot; The belief persists that he is an instrument of british policy.(iv) Meanwhile there is no doubt that, although General de Gaulle at presentcarries little weight in France, save as a symbol of resistance, any action by His Majesty&apos;s Government interpreted by the French people as an unjustified betrayal of General de Gaulle, would seriouslyalienate French sympathy for this country.I would emphasise that although these conclusions may be correct to-day, theshifting sands of French public opinion may invalidate them a few weeks hence.The situation should be kept under close review.(Signed)        -D. MORTON.
