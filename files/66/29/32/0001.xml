COMBINED OPERATIONS.1. A small force sailed from Portland on the evening of the 3rd in a M.T.B.with the object of carrying out a raid on Sark. A landing was made without incident by a party of five. Five Germans, sleeping in separate rooms, in the annex of an hotel, were surprised and taken prisoner, and a number of paperscollected.The prisoners were assembled, and, owing to the probability that they would attempt to escape in the darkness when passing through a wood on the return tothe shore, their hands were temporarily bound in front of them. Four of the prisoners began shouting and, in endeavouring to escape, were shot.The landing party, having suffered no casualties, re-embarked and returnedto Portland Harbour with the remaining prisoner.NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.2.   Our light forces have been active in the Channel and off the Dutch coast.E-boats have attacked shipping off our south and east coasts.U-boat activity has extended to the Capetown area.Shipping losses reported have been relatively light, but full details of casulties in the Capetown area are not yet available.Home Waters.3. On the night of the lst/2nd, during an unsuccessful attack by E-boatson a coastal convoy off Start Point, an escort trawler was sunk and two M.L.&apos;were damaged. On the following night, in foggy weather, our light forces off theDutch&apos; coast claimed hits on four enemy trawlers. One M.G.B. was lost. Onthe night of the 3rd/4th, a large and heavily escorted enemy ship was interceptednorth of the Texel and many hits were claimed on the escorts. On the night ofthe 5th/6th. another large ship, heavily eccorted, was engaged off Flushing andone E-boat was destroyed.   One M.T.B. and one M.G.B. were lost.- A northbound coastal convoy escorted by two destroyers was attacked by12 E-boats. off Cromer, early on the morning of the 7th. Three ships in the convoy,a rescue tug and a M.L. were torpedoed.Mediterranean.4. On the 18th September, H.M. Submarine Taku sank a southbound ship offTobruk.On the 1st, three M.T.Bs. from Cyprus fired torpedoes into Rhodes harbourwhich caused five explosions.During the week 30.562 tons of French merchant shipping westbound and36.947 tons east-bound have passed Gibraltar under escort.Black Sea.5. It is reported that two Russian destroyers bombarded the port of Yaltaon the night of the 3rd. A Russian submarine sank a 2,000-ton ship in convoy off the Roumanian coast on the 25th September.On the nights of the 19th/&apos;20th and the 20th/21st September Russian landingparties from light craft carried out an operation 20 miles west of Novorossisk.A large number of enemy troops was surrounded and casualties were inflicted.A patrol boat and a quantity of stores were destroyed.Pacific.6. A United States submarine, operating in Far Eastern waters, has reported sinking one seaplane tender and four cargo ships: two cargo ships were probably sunk and one tanker damaged.7. It is reported that 115 enemy ships have been successfully attacked by united States submarines to date, of which 74 were sunk, 19 probably sunk and22 damaged.8. Aircraft are reported to&apos; have damaged one enemy heavy cruiser and a destroyer; four other cruisers may have been damaged. A U-boat was sunkin the Aleutian Islands.   Details are given in the Air situation.
Anii-Submarine Operations.9. Apart- from attacks carried out from the United States, five attacks on U-boats have been carried out by surface craft and 21 by aircraft. Six attacks on one day were made by aircraft from Iceland (C) on U-boats which wereshadowing a homeward bound convoy from Canada.At least two promising aircraft attacks were carried out in the Bay of biscay.H.M. Corvette Crocus rammed a U-boat off Freetown and one of our aircraftdamaged an Italian U-boat in this area.A Japanese U-boat was probably damaged by aircraft in the New Guineaarea. Promising attacks by United States aircraft were carried out off DutchGuiana and Trinidad.10. In Home Waters during the last three months Allied aircraft have reported 238 U-boat sightings, from which 160 attacks have developed.Enemy Intelligence.German.11.   There is no change in the disposition of German main units.Italian.12. Air reconnaissance of northern Adriatic ports carried out on the 2ndshowed, the new battleship Impero, at Venice, still incomplete. At Trieste the battleship Cavour, sunk in the naval air attack on Taranto in 1940, was seenwith her main armament complete except for one turret, but her secondaryarmament incomplete.   The cruiser Cadorna was at Pola.13. The flow of shipping from Italy to Libya has still further decreaseddue to our air and submarine attacks. Very few ships are known to have reachedLibyan ports during the past week.Japanese.14. Most of the Japanese naval forces are in the Caroline Islands, but three or four heavy cruisers and three light cruisers with 16 destroyers are operating in the Bougainville area. It is believed that the Japanese have denuded,the Netherlands East Indies and Malayan areas of everything larger thandestroyers, in order to effect this concentration in the SW. Pacific.U-Boats.15. Over 100 U-boats are now operating in the Atlantic, with concentrationson the convoy routes outside the effective range of aircraft based on Ireland (R)and Canada.There has been considerable activity east of Trinidad and in the latter partof the week a number of U-boats have been reported off Capetown. JapaneseU-boats have been operating in the Gulf of Oman, in the Bay of Bengal and offthe coast of Oregon.Protection of Seaborne Trade.16. During the week ending 4th/5th, 961 ships have been convoyed. Ofthese 248 were in ocean convoys and 713 in British coastal convoys. Three anti-aircraft ships, one armed merchant cruiser, 59 destroyers (including one UnitedStates destroyer) and 105 sloops, cutters and corvettes (including four United.States cutters) were employed on escort duties.During the week, 159 ships in five ocean convoys arrived in Home Waters.Four ships, two of which were stragglers, were sunk.17. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 3rd totalled 570,260 tons, compared with 759,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 692,700 tons for the past ten weeks. Ofthe week&apos;s imports, 209,297 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.18. Twenty ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boats during theweek, and of these nine are known to have sunk. One ship in homeward-bound convoy and one straggler from an outward-bound convoy were torpedoed in theN.W. Approaches.[24457] &apos; b 2
Seven ships were attacked to the east of Trinidad, one south-west ofFreetown, six off Cape Town, two in the Bay of Bengal and two off the Pacificseaboard of the United States.Three ships in coastal convoy were torpedoed by E-boats off Cromer, andone ship was mined and sunk off the Humber.19. The provisional figure of shipping losses in September (details of whichwill be included next week) is just over 462,000 tons. Apart from the losses by air attack in the convoy to Russia, almost all the remainder have been caused by -boat attacks in the Atlantic.20. Approximately 17,000 officers and men of the British Mercantile marine and 600 seamen in British fishing boats have been killed bv enemy action up tothe 31st August, 1942. From the 27th September, 1941, to the 31st July, 1942,United States merchant marine casualties are reported as 410 killed and1,891 missing.British Minelaying.21. During the week light craft laid mines off the Dutch and Flemish coastsand in the Dover Straits. One of our submarines laid mines off Tobruk. Aircraftminelaying took place, on a small scale, off the German North Sea coast and inthe Channel.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.22. There has been no enemy minelaying by aircraft during the week. on one night E-boats were suspected of minelaying between Start Point and theEddystone. In the Lyme Bay area a total of 82 mines have been destroyed and21 others have been accounted for. Six mines were swept off Malta on the22nd September. The mine totals to date are : acoustic 1,324; magnetic 2.645;moored 1,711.Enemy Merchant Shipping.23. Since the middle of August, 13 enemy ships are reported to have been mined in Danish waters, seven of which are known to have sunk.The enemy blockade runner, probably the German s.s. Belgrano (6,095 tons),which was attacked by aircraft in the Bay of Biscay and put into Ferrol onthe 3rd, was expected to complete her repairs by the 9th.It is reported from Massawa that the German s.s Liebenfels (6,318 tons)was taken in prize on the 30th September.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.Northern Sector.24. The Russian attacks south of Lake Ladoga have increased in intensity,but have been met by German counter-attacks, which appear to have had someappreciable success. There is probably some truth in the German claim to havesurrounded a Russian force in this area, but there is no confirmation that itamounts to seven divisions as the Germans state.Central Sector.25. Heavy fighting has continued in the Rzhev area, where the Russians havemade further attacks.Don Sector.26. The Russians have continued their attempts to reduce the Germanbridgehead at Voronezh and have also tried to force fresh crossings of the Donin the area south of Svoboda.  They do not appear to have had any great success.Stalingrad Sector.27. The German northern flank has been subjected to further heavy Russianattacks, but, in general, has held firm. Attacks have also continued on the Germansouthern flank, but do not appear to have made any progress.
In the city .of Stalingrad itself Russian resistance is as fierce as ever, butthe Germans are very&apos; slowly gaining ground in the centre and north and are substantially in control in the south.Caucasus Sector.28. The Germans are still held on the northern bank of the River Terek,but south-west of Mozdok they have made a further slight advance. They are-still some 25 miles from Tuapse and are meeting very strong Russian resistance.North-east of Novorossisk the Russians have improved their positions by repeatedcounter-attacks.Black Sea.29. While the Russian fleet has been active against Crimean and occupiedBlack Sea ports, the Germans have been bombing the Russian Black Sea ports,and the harbour of Tuapse is reported to be largely destroyed.Summary.30. In no sector have the Germans made any rapid progress, and atStalingrad in particular their advance is extremely slow. The approach of winter strictly limits the possibilities open to them in the near future, even ifStalingrad should fall immediately, of which there is no sign. Unless an attackwere made soon, any fresh German offensive, apart perhaps, from an advance toAstrakhan, would probably be limited to the Caucasus sector.Egypt.31. On the 30th September wc carried out an infantry brigade attack against the north-eastern face of the enemy salient at the southern end of our line.Our objectives were limited to the eastern rim of the Deir el Munassibdepression. This runs roughly east and west for about eight miles and our intention was to secure the northern and southern rims for three miles fromthe eastern end.This attack had generous artillery support and the northern rim was captured. Our western advance along the southern rim, however, was delayedby mines and field works and although our troops reached their objectives theywere unable to dislodge the enemy from his positions on the southern rim. we now hold three miles of the northern rim and a mile and a half of the southernrim at the eastern end. of the depression.Since then the enemy has carried out a raid on our forward positions onthe northern edge of the Deir el Munassib and he is also reported to have occupied some company localities along the southern rim.Apart from these operations there has been only normal patrol activity.Madagascar.32. By the 1st October the leading elements cf our forces from Tananarivehad reached a point about 50 miles south of the capital. Their progress wasslowed by numerous obstructions which the retiring Vichy French forces had placed on the road. On the evening of the 2nd our forces reached Antsirabe(80 miles south of Tananarive). They had thus covered 460 miles in 23 days intheir advance from Majunga. They have been joined by forces which capturedTamatave and have since moved up by road and rail.Far East.South- West Pacific.33. In New Guinea the Australian counter-attack has reached the Kagi-Myola area, overlooking Kokocla, without encountering the main body of theenemy, who on the 29th September withdrew through the gap in the Owen Stanleyrange. Another small force of Australians is moving through the Owen Stanleymountains to the north-west of Kokoda.A small Allied force of all arms landed at Collingwood Bay (north-west ofMilne Bay) on the 5th October, and is believed to have achieved complete surprise.south Pacific.34. The garrison at Fiji has been reinforced by one U.S. Infantry Regimentand now totals one complete U.S. Infantry Division. -
Central Pacific.35. The Hawaiian garrison has been reinforced by one U.S. infantry division, bringing the total strength to four infantry divisions and one infantryregiment.North Pacific.36. (a) Alaska. U.S. War Department has announced that the Canadian-Alaska military highway will be ready for use by the 1st December, 1942. Theroad begins at the railhead at Dawson Creek (British Columbia) and runs viaWhite Horse (Yukon) to Fairbanks (Alaska).37. (b) Aleutians. Attu and Agattu Islands (western extremity of theAleutians) have been evacuated by the Japanese.U.S. forces are reported to have occupied islands, including Adak Island, inthe Andreanof Group (500 miles west of Dutch Harbour).Intelligence.France and the Loiv Countries.38. There are strong indications that a new German armoured division isbeing formed in Brittany, probably by conversion of 17th Infantry Division. Anew division, known at present as the Division Schacky, is being formed in thearea Nevers-Chalon-sur-Saone, increasing the number of German divisions to31 in France and 5 in the Low Countries. It is not yet clear whether DivisionSchacky is an infantry or a training division.AIR SITUATION.General.39: Bomber Command aircraft made heavy attacks on Krefeld, Aachen andOsnabruck.Our operations in Egypt and in the Mediterranean were hampered by bad weather.In the Pacific Zone, successful attacks have been made on enemy shipping and a large number of enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat.United Kingdom.40. Fighter Command flew 662 sorties by day (including eight by US.aircraft) and 121 by night.Enemy activity against this country was on a very small scale. Only 12enemy aircraft flew overland by day and one by night.Germany and Occupied Territory.Bay.41. Fighter and Bomber Commands despatched 310 and 17 offensive sorties respectively compared with 119 and ten last week. In addition, 97 U.S. Fightersorties and 73 U.S. Bomber sorties were flown which compares with 79 and 62last week.The only major operation of the week took place on the 2nd, when43 Fortresses were despatched to attack the Potez airframe factory at Meaulte.In conjunction with this attack, 12 U.S.. Bostons bombed the docks at Havre andother Fortresses attacked the Longuenesse aerodrome at St. Omer and. carriedout a diversionary sweep over Cayeux. Many bursts were seen on the target atMeaulte, and on dispersal points and the aerodrome at Longuenesse (seeAppendix VII). Considerable enemy fighter opposition was encountered andthe Fortresses, without loss to themselves, destroyed one fighter, probably destroyed 24 and damaged 13. Escort and support to these operations were supplied by 34 Squadrons of fighters (including eight US. Squadrons) and thesedestroyed six enemy fighters, probably destroyed five and damaged three for theloss of six aircraft from which one pilot was saved.Five Mosquitos attacked the Ougree steel and armament works (near Liege),numerous bursts and fires being observed on the target. Other attacks, mostlyby single Mosquitos, were made on the Sluiskil chemical works, where the sulphatestore and power station were hit; the Diesel engine works at Hengelo, where a
large eight-storied building was damaged; the power station at Hengelo, whichwas hit and for a short period was enveloped in red flames; and on Siegen,Bremen, Minister and Saarbrucken.Aircraft of the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit and of Army Co-operationCommand flew 74 sorties.Night.42. Bomber Command operated on four nights of the week, a total of812 sorties being despatched against land targets. Last week there were no night operations. Heavy attacks were made on Krefeld, Aachen and Osnabruck; a smaller force operated against Wismar, Flensburg and Lubeck. Except atOsnabruck, difficult weather conditions were experienced.At Krefeld, about 309 tons of H.E. and incendiaries were dropped, butdarkness and thick ground haze made identification difficult. Numerous fires were seen in the town but no accurate estimate of results could be made.Aachen was attacked by 180 aircraft, which dropped 447 tons of H.E. andincendiaries. Severe electrical storms and icing conditions were encountered soon after the take-off and, although better conditions prevailed over the target, groundhaze again made accurate pinpointing extremely difficult and most crews bombed by the Pathfinders&apos; flares, which themselves were scattered. Good concentrations of fires were seen in the centre of the town as well as others spread over, a wide area.At Wismar and Lubeck, similar conditions prevailed although at the lattersome crews were able to identify the River Trave and the U-boat slipways atHerrenwijk.At Flensburg, however, the sky was cloudless and visibility good and themajority of aircraft attacked from below 1,600 feet. Many fires w-ere seenburning in the U-boat building yards. Flak defences were found to be considerably stronger than in the previous attack, and 12 of the 27 aircraft dispatched on this target failed to return.A successful raid was carried out on Osnabruck, where about 90 per cent,of the 237 aircraft despatched attacked the target. Approximately 463 tons ofH.E. and incendiaries wrere dropped. Well placed flares from the Pathfindersgave considerable assistance to the crews which followed, and concentrated fires were seen.In the above operations, 698 tons of 7d.E. (including 238 x 4,000 lbs.) and889 tons of incendiaries were dropped. Thirty-eight of our bombers are missing and a further eight crashed in this country.No Intruder operations wrere carried out.Cpastal Operations.43. Coastal - Command despatched 412 sorties of which 205 were on anti-U-boat operations and 24 on convoy escort. . Bomber Command aircraft flew 24 sorties west of the Bay of Biscay. Fighter Command flew 395 sorties(of which 12 were by United States aircraft) on shipping protection patrols and a further 79 offensive sorties against shipping.Three Sunderlands attacked an outward-bound enemy blockade-runner offCap Finisterre and although no direct hits are claimed, the vessel is now reported to be in Ferrol.A night attack on a convoy off Terschelling was made by seven Hudsonswhich attacked four vessels with unobserved results.Our fighters operating off the Dutch, Belgian and French coasts damagedthree minesweepers (one of which ran aground), two small coasters and a1.500-ton tanker.Mediterranean.Egypt and Libya.44. Bad weather hampered our air operations during the greater part ofthe week. Allied aircraft flew 1,078 sorties compared with 1,208 in theprevious week. -Our fighters maintained reconnaissance and offensive patrols over the battle area and provided protection for shipping off Port Said and in the Gulf of suez. On the 1st, our fighters intercepted a heavily escorted dive-bomberformation forcing the enemy to jettison his bombs on his own troops.  Six Ju. 87s
were destroyed and one Ju. 87 and one Me. 109 were probably destroyed without loss to our own aircraft..Fighter-bombers continued their attacks on enemy mechanical transport.On the 6th. a total of 12 Hurricanes and 53 Kittyhawks made six attacks onmechanical transport in the battle area causing considerable damage. In oneattack alone over 25 vehicles were set on fire. Attacks were also carried out onBomba seaplane base where one aircraft was destroyed and 14 were seriously damaged, on El Daba landing ground, on trains on the coastal railway and onworking parties. Eight Baltimores escorted by fighters made a successfuldaylight attack on petrol dumps at El Daba.Benghazi Harbour was attacked at dusk by six United States Liberators.Several hits were scored on the Central Mole.  Another Liberator bombed Bardia.A night attack on Tobruk was carried out by six Halifaxes and 34Wellingtons. Near misses were obtained on a ship and many bursts were observedon the water front and near a power station. Three other Wellingtons bombedaerodromes near El Daba and El Gubbi. Seventeen Bostons bombed dispersedaircraft on landing grounds at Sidi Haneish.Enemy activity, although still slight, was on an increased scale Severalattacks were made by dive-bombers and fighter-bombers on our troops, mechanical transport and artillery positions in the central and southern sectors. ThreeMe. 109s dive-bombed Alexandria harbour ineffectively.Malta.45.   In the week ending the 5th October our aircraft flew 282 sorties.Enemy activity consisted mainly of fighter sweeps, most of which, on sightingour fighters, withdrew without crossing the coast. No bombs were dropped on Malta.Greece and Crete.46! Eight U.S. Liberators bombed Navarino Harbour, where a ship was hit. Wellingtons bombed Maleme aerodrome and destroyed three aircraft on theground.Sea Communications.47. A southbound convoy, consisting of a 3,000-ton tanker, a 6,000-ton ship and three destroyers, was attacked off the Libyan coast by eight Liberators and later by three Wellingtons.  The tanker was torpedoed and set on fire.A 7,000-ton ship, escorted by three destroyers on a south-easterly course, was torpedoed by Wellingtons west of Corfu. A reconnaissance made on the follow-ing day revealed that the ships had entered Corfu harbour.Four Liberators attacked a ship and two destroyers off the coast of Crete.Near misses were obtained on the three vessels.A Maryland machine-gunned two schooners north of Tobruk, and Beau-fighters attacked laden tank-landing craft off Sidi Barrani.Russian Front.48. The Russians claim that in the week ending the 1st October the Germanslost 257 aircraft against 137 of their own.In the Far North, Russian bombers sank two transport vessels in anunspecified area.In the Baltic an enemy harbour was successfully bombed and. an aerodromeattacked; two Ju. 88s were destroyed on the ground and three other aircraft inthe air.Enemy troops and communications in the Stalingrad and Voronesh areas were continuously attacked by Russian bombers.Aircraft of the Black Sea Fleet heavily bombed enemy formations in theCaucasus and sank several German barges, trawlers and supply ships in the black Sea.The estimated number of enemy aircraft engaged, on the Russian Frontcontinues to be about 2,400, the main scale of effort being maintained in theStalingrad and Caucasus sectors. Activity increased in the Terek River andTuapse areas.There was an increase in enemy activity on the Leningrad front where, it isestimated, about 500 German aircraft are engaged.In the North, several bombing attacks were made on Archangel.
Burma.49. A total of 31 Blenheims operated, of which 13 attacked the oil-producingcentre of Yenangyuang; bursts were observed among buildings and barracks.Other Blenheims attacked the barracks at Meiktila, the Shewbo cantonment, the village of Rathedaung (20 miles north of Akyab) and Akyab harbour. One enemybomber was destroyed by a Mohawk on escort duty.U.S. Mitchells attacked barracks at Myitkyina, bridges near Mogaung andTingka (15 miles north of Loiwing), rolling-stock and railway tracks near Kathaand Mogaung, objectives at Lashio and Loiwing (50 miles north of Lashio). andother targets near the Yunnan/Burma frontier.China.50. U.S. fighters bombed, machine-gunned and heavily damaged Washaw-ngand two adjacent villages.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.51. United States aircraft (Fortresses, Mitchells, Bostons and Airacobras)have continued to bomb and machine-gun enemy objectives in the Buna-Kokoda-Efogi areas. The bridge at Wairopi (16 miles east of Kokoda) has again been hit and is now reported to be demolished.Barges and other objectives in the Buna area were attacked by Allied aircraft on four occasions. An A.A. post and at least six barges wrere destroyed and a supply dump was blown up.Medium bombers attacked a small enemy convoy off Buna and destroyed three off the enemy fighters which intercepted.R.A.A.F. Beaufighters attacked buildings at Salamoa, and machine-gunnedenemy positions on Goodehough Island.New Britain.52. United States Fortresses attacked shipping in Rabaul harbour. Twotransports of 15,000 and 7,000 tons were hit and set on fire. It is probable that a cruiser and another ship were also hit.Two attacks were made by Allied heav)7 bombers on aerodromes in the Rabaularea. Runways, dispersal areas and an ammunition dump w^ere hit. In combat,four enemy fighters were destroyed and a further four wrere probably destroyed for the loss of one Allied bomber.Solomon Islands.53. Ten United States heavy bombers attacked a light cruiser nearBougainville Island. One bomber was shot down by A. A. fire and seven more were damaged by enemy fighters, of which eight were destroyed.Ten Beauforts, of which one is missing, made torpedo attacks on shipping inthe Buin-Faisi area. Three light cruisers and two cargo vessels are believed tohave been hit.A heavy enemy cruiser off Guadalcanal was attacked and damaged by allied aircraft. Small enemy supply craft in the same area and enemy installations atRekata Bay, where a munitions dump was set on fire, were also attacked. Twointercepting seaplanes were destroyed.Between the 27th September and the 5th October, Catalinas made five attacks on the aerodrome at Buin and one of these is believed to have caused extensive damage, including the destruction of W/T installations . Buka aerodrome was bombed on three occasions; hits were made on dispersal bays and at least one aircraft on the ground was destroyed..United States dive bombers and torpedo aircraft hit and damaged one of four destroyers south of the New Georgia group.Between the 27th September and. the 4th October, enemy bombers with strongfighter escort made six attacks on Allied positions --on Guadalcanal Island.Fifty-one of these raiders were destroyed by Allied fighters.Netherlands East Indies.54.
