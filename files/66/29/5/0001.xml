ITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S/COVERI^ME^t/)7^^13--- V \f\[p.(42) 4S5o copy no.f5n7T&quot;Sep tcmber, J.942/V/xJR    cabinet.XUJEL DA^GE TO MALTA,Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,The memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies(war*(42) 423) sets out fully the arguments for and against the giving  of a   guarantee that the whole cost of war damage payments in Malta, so far as it falls on public funds (i.e. so far as it isnot met by contributions) will be borne by the Imperial GovernmentsI confirm that the giving of such a guarantee wouldrequire the authority of legislation in the Imperial Parliament,I fully recognise the difficulties which the Secretaryof State and the Governor feel on this subject and the unexampledservices, which the Island has rendered and is rendering to thecause of&quot; the United Nationso    I entirely agree that large sumsgenerously given will be necessary for the rebuilding of malta and for the development of its services generally,I feel- however, considerable misgivings about.expressingour intentions in a form which requires statutory authority inParliaments    There has been and still is strong pressure from those with property in Malaya and other territories which have beenoverrun by the enemy in the Far East that we should, undertake adefinite liability for the restoration of their property.    the sums at stake in these areas.are far greater than those involvedat Malta and are indeed such that any guarantee in their case would create alarming financial problems for us at the end of thewar when we shall in any event have a difficult financial situation to face,,   We have felt bound to resist claims in these cases andto take the line that no promises of financial support to war damage schemes can be given to Colonial Governments until the endof the war when liabilities can be defined.I fear that discussion in Parliament of a guarantee to malta would be bound to bring this pressure to a head and that neither the services of Malta nor the greater potential wealth ofthe other areas would be regarded as adequate ground for differentialtreatment for the financial consequences of war damage.I should add a word on the true nature of the action whichis proposed,    The Bill we are asked to guarantee is not technicallya bill for rebuilding Malta,    It is a bill for paying compensation to owners of property and the fact that they will get thiscompensation is no guarantee that a better Malta will arise,    I amin full sympathy with the idea that we should be generous in helping to rebuild a finer Malta but that is not the proposal in thepresent Billo   We have not even been told whether the landlords of maltese properties who would receive most of the compensation are themselves resident in Malta or not,I would press that while we should give a general under-taking of specially generous assistance, we should not go to apoint which would involve us in legislation here.Treasury, S.w.1, &apos;22nd September, 1942,
