(42) 421.September 21, 1942.WAR CABINET.INDIAN STERLING BALANCES.(Reference : W.M. (42) 125th Conclusions.)Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I circulate herewith the draft of a telegram to the Viceroy which has beenagreed by the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of State for India and myself.K. W.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1,September 21, 1942.Draft Telegram from the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy.THE War Cabinet have given further consideration to the question of theWar Financial Settlement of 1940 and have reached the following general conclusions : The War Cabinet fully recognise that a considerable proportion of theexpenditure so far incurred by the Government of India and recoverable by Indiaunder the 1940 settlement contributes to the general war effort but otherwisebears no relation to the defence of India. They recognise also that the spread ofthe war to the Far East has meant that India is now incurring far more expendi-ture in her own local defence than was contemplated when the settlement of April1940 was concluded. They also wish to acknowledge the extent of the resources in men and material which India is making available as part of the commonwar effort of the United Nations.The War Cabinet nevertheless feel that they should put on record their viewthat the entry of Japan into the war, finally revealing the war as a world struggle against the forces of tyranny and reaction, has fundamentally changed thesituation since the financial settlement of 1940 was negotiated. Great changesin the scope and character of the war have taken place since then, and even greater changes may take place. At that time the war was being waged betweenEuropean Powers alone. To-day no country can afford to take a limited viewof the nature of the struggle in its entirety, nor of the measures required for itsown defence. This changed situation calls for a wider conception of Indianspartnership in the general war effort of the United Nations, and therefore of the contribution she needs to make in her own defence. While the financial settle-ment as it stands leads to the United Kingdom accumulating large indebtednessto India on expenditure, much of which has been incurred in India&apos;s defence(largely because British industry, instead of meeting the adverse balance byexports, is absorbed in the output of munitions to use in the common cause),President Roosevelt has recently enunciated the principle that none of the united nations should end the war with a monetary war debt to arty of its partners:His Majesty&apos;s Government are impressed alike with the general wisdom of this objective and with the necessity to bear it in mind in the relations between thiscountry and India.[243771
It will be recalled that, at the time when the financial settlement ofApril 1940 was under discussion, the Chancellor of the Exchequer stipulated that the possibility of India&apos;s making some payment towards the general costof the war should be considered from time to time as circumstances permitted.His Majesty&apos;s Government do not suggest that a new settlement shouldbe negotiated at the present juncture, and they agree that arrangements should accordingly continue for accounts to be kept on the basis ofthe settlement reached in April 1940. A further- review and an eventualadjustment of financial relations between the United Kingdom and india will assuredly be required, whether at the end of the war or upon someearlier appropriate occasion, in the light both of the general financial settlement between the Allied Nations and of the vital importance for all concerned of the speedy restoration of the maximum volume of world trade.
