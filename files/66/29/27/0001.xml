THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1942.SECRET. Copy. No-W.P. (42) 447.October 5, 1942./WAR CABINET.INDIA.Indian Sterling Balances.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I CIRCULATE for consideration the Viceroy&apos;s reply regarding the reserva-tion suggested by the War Cabinet on the subject of Indian Sterling Balances,the text of which is in Personal telegrams to the Viceroy, Nos. 16781 and 16782,dated the 24th September (already circulated). The objections and dangersstressed by the Viceroy, and his own earnest appeal to the War Cabinet not toraise this matter unnecessarily, will, I trust, be regarded as conclusive againstpursuing the matter at the present critical juncture.L. S. A.India Office, October 5, 1942.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India dated October 2, 1942.399-S.C. Your Personal No. 16781, dated 24th September, 1942 a sterling balances.2. It is impossible to predict with certainty precise effect on Council of communicating to them of contents of your Personal No. 16782. Sub-paragraphs(1) and (2) of yOur 16781 would, of course, be communicated to them simul-taneously with main declaration, and this should obviate any danger of individualresignations. They would, however, at once recognise declaration for what itis, namely, a formal reservation by His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to futuretreatment of debt which Britain is incurring to India under present settlement.Majority opinion would almost certainly be that such reservation could not beaccepted, and that a vigorously argued protest or challenge should be lodged on india&apos;s behalf. My difficulty in securing acceptance of Raisman&apos;s proposals for undertaking additional burdens within the framework of the existing settlement would, of course, be very greatly intensified. A counter-claim would mostprobably be put forward for a revision of the settlement in India&apos;s favour; for fixing of a definite monetary limit to India&apos;s defence liabilities, and for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to defray unconditionally all excess expenditure.3. Most serious aspect of the matter lies, however, in the consequences whichwould flow from open or surreptitious publication of the fact that reservationhad been lodged by His Majesty&apos;s Government. It is possible, but not I thinklikely, that Council might ask for publication. Even if they do.not, however,I regret to say that it is quite impossible to ensure that no knowledge of the factthat a reservation had been made would reach the public. We have, therefore,undoubtedly to reckon with the effects of the inevitable disclosure of this fact.In what follows I am stating not merely my own and Raisman&apos;s views but also those of Taylor, Governor of Reserve Bank of India, who has.been consulted.4. There is already much uneasiness in Indian financial and commercialcircles regarding the size and rate of sterling accumulations, and in various[24446] t
quarters suggestion had been put forward that a demand should be made for payment at least in part in gold or dollars, or that India should receive aguarantee against post-war depreciation of sterling. In the meantime, it is claimed that sterling balances should be used for the acquisition of privateBritish investments in India as well as for repatriation of all public or quasi-public debt. This attitude has already been taken up by certain members of theBoard of Reserve Bank. Hitherto, Taylor has succeeded in preventing passingof embarrassing resolution by emphasising importance and value of sterling for post-war re-equipment and industrial expansion of India. Raisman has takensimilar line in Legislature. When once, however, knowledge of His Majesty&apos;governments reservation begins to percolate, it will be impossible any longer tomaintain this reassuring front, nor could Raisman and Taylor, with their privateknowledge of position, be expected to do so. Matters would undoubtedly cometo a head both in Legislature and in Board of Reserve Bank, the Hindu majorityof which has strong Congress affinities. It is difficult to foresee the exact formin which the Board would set out to create trouble, but at least we should be faced with a widespread and insistent demand for payment in other forms. since his Majesty&apos;s Government would, I presume, not be prepared to incur a monetarydebt to America in order to gratify India&apos;s demand for dollars or gold, theBoard would probably refuse to acquiesce in continued expansion of rupeecurrency against sterling assets, but resign in protest. This in turn would have its repercussions on position of Members of Council, particularly those whosecontacts are with Hindu commercial community. These would probably find it increasing difficult to remain in office. The fact even that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had (? purported) to deal with (? Governor-General) on an equal footing in this matter would be travestied as a cunning device to disguise theinescapable fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government in final reckoning still retainsits advantage in dealing with Government of India. In that case we should find that on this issue alone we had precipitated a further political crisis of most formidable proportions, and a most serious aggravation of our existing difficulties.5. My considered conclusion is that I must warn the Cabinet with all the emphasis at my command against communicating this reservation to Council. Itcan, in my opinion, do no good, and,-on the other hand, it is difficult to exaggeratethe gravity of consequences it may have on political situation and on industrial and commercial aspects of India&apos;s war effort. Such demarche would be fraughtwith great perils at any time during the war, and at present critical junctureit may well prove disastrous. I would urge with all earnestness that questiondealing with adjustment of post-war obligations of Britain to India be left to be(corrupt group), if it seems necessary or desirable, with post-war (^Governmentof India), in the light of conditions then existing.6. I must add finally that, as I have already indicated in paragraph 10 ofmy private and personal telegram 2828-S dated 20th September, I personally couldnot possibly take note of a reservation of this character which could not becommunicated to Council.\
