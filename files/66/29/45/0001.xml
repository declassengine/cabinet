THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT&quot;Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 465.October 13, 1942.WAR CABINET.REPORT ON A VISIT TO NORTH-WEST CANADA AND ALASKA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I think the attached despatch from the United Kingdom High Commis-sioner at Ottawa, reporting on a visit he recently made to the North-WesternProvinces of Canada and Alaska, will be of interest to my colleagues.C. R. A.Dominions Office, October 13, 1942.Office of the High Commissioner(No. 508.   Secret.) for the United Kingdom,Sir, Ottawa, September 4, 1942.I have the honour to inform you that I have recently returned from anorthern journey. My companions were Mr. T. A. Crerar and Dr. CharlesCamsell (the Minister and Deputy-Minister of Mines and Resources respectively)and Mr. Ian Maclennan of this Office. We made the trip in an amphibianaeroplane, and in three weeks travelled some 8,700 miles. We landed in variousplaces in Northern Alberta, Northern British Columbia, the Yukon and theNorth-West Territories, flew over a part of Alaska, and at our furthest pointalighted 120 miles north of the Arctic Circle, at Aklavik. Generally speaking,this vast area is a land in which the virgin forest still reigns undisturbed overplains and mountains. Its spruce and poplar trees crowd to the edges of thousands of lakes and along the banks of many rivers. It is populated bymillions of moose, caribou, wolves, bears and other fur-bearing animals, but only by small scattered communities of human beings.2. We had two main purposes in making this journey. The first was to inspect the progress of the Alaska Highway and other works now being under-taken in Canada for the military defence of Alaska and Western Canada. Thereare three such main efforts. The first is the building of the Highway itself,the second is the construction of a chain of airfields along a similar route, andthe third is the development of oil production at Norman Wells (on the banks of the Mackenzie River), with the laying of a pipe-line to transport this fuelto Alaska. The American authorities are responsible for the building of the highway, Canadian contractors are constructing the airfields, the Canadianofficers of the Imperial Oil Company are charged with the production of oil atNorman Wells, and the American army is undertaking the laying of the oil pipe-line. Some Americans are also surveying the terrain for a railway to Alaska,but this is a more remote project.3.   Our second purpose in going north was to meet the white settlers,Indians, Eskimos and half-breeds in those outlandish places, and to have a look at the conditions and prospects of fur-trading, mining and other activities there.[24490] . B
The Alaska Highway.4. The Alaska Highway is to run for some 1,500 miles from Dawson Creek(the terminal of the Northern Alberta Railway) through the passes and along the valleys of the Rocky Mountains to Fairbanks in Alaska. I need not enlargeupon the difficulties of a piece of construction which bids fair to be the greatestbit of road-making yet attempted by man. I will simply state that thosedifficulties have a way of disappearing before American imagination, boldnessand mechanical resource. Whilst you look at it the road grows by leaps andbounds before your eyes. We motored along some miles of it and flew along somehundreds of miles of it. It is being constructed in a series of pieces, each of whichstretches through the forest until it joins with the next-door bits. The americans are being unnecessarily extravagant and making some mistakes. It does notmatter. They are driving the road through. They have mobilised great herdsof the most modern construction vehicles, which are worthy associates of themoose, bears and other wild creatures who are also sometimes to be seen careeringamongst the trees. But the newcomers are much more powerful than those old-timers. There is, for instance, the bull-dozer. I was told that each bull-dozeralong- the Highway can clear each day a strip of ground seven miles long throughthe dense forest. There are many of these pugnacious creatures continuously onthe job. for work on the Highway proceeds without interruption day and night.First the pioneer road is cleared, and after it follows the more finished gravelroad. The Americans expect to complete the 1,500 miles of pioneer road and long patches of the gravelled road before winter freezes construction this year.They expect to complete the whole gravel road next year. Along the entire routethe cleared ground will be 36 feet wide with a gravelled strip 24 feet widerunning along its centre. There is some talk of hard-surfacing the road later,but no decision about this has been taken.The Airfields.5. Thte chain of airfields (which does not coincide everywhere with the routeof the Highway) is also being rapidly made. We landed on all of the fields saveone, and looked upon that one from the air. Some of them are close to existingsettlements or Hudson Bay Company forts, whilst others are being cut straightout of the untamed bush. There are seven airfields between Edmonton andFairbanks inclusive, and in addition landing strips are now being put down everyhundred miles. All of them are to have 5,000-i&apos;eet runways, and in some casesrunways of nearly 7,000 feet are being constructed. On them also work proceedswithout interruption day and night. I slept two nights in a sleeping-bag on oneof the fields, and was often woken by the rumble and crash of the grading-machines in action.6. Already a considerable traffic is making gigantic hops-skips-and-jumpsalong this air route northwards. Fighter and bomber aircraft and huge trans-port &apos;planes speed in a steady stream to Alaska. The transports are carrying-men and materials. It is strange to meet them in the forest. One day I watchedone of these creatures alight on a runway amidst the surrounding trees, open itsdoor and eject a couple of jeeps. It was easy to imagine that one was reallywatching a prehistoric monster giving birth to twins.7. R.C.A.F. administrative staffs are to be in charge of all the Canadianairfields but the groundcrews to service aircraft passing through will be providedby the United States Army Air Corps. I beg the Air Ministry to keep a close eyeon this important air route. Unless I am mistaken it will be the simplest,speediest and busiest airway from the Americas to the Orient in the future. Andthe air route which the Americans are now planning across Canada and throughHudson Bay, Greenland and Iceland to Europe will have similar prospects in the opposite direction. The Agreement between Canada and the United Statesprovides that after the war the Alaska Highway, the airfields across NorthernCanada and the other defence works shall all revert in unqualified ownership tothe Dominion. But I confess that I do not trust all the responsible authoritiesamongst our American allies, and I saw enough in the north-west to give mean unpleasant feeling that they will seek to use their power after the war to gain control of these vital air-routes. Mr. Crerar and I have communicated ouropinions on this to members of the Canadian Government. It is primarily forthem to defend British interests in Canada, but I trust that in Britain weshall be alert to stimulate and support them in any efforts that may be needed.
8. At present the oil for Alaska has to travel from distant places to theAmerican Pacific seaboard, then up the coast by ship to Skagway, across the mountains by rail to Whitehorse and thence by road to its destination in Alaska.The route is long and vulnerable to a daring enemy. There is a much closerpotential source of oil supply a few hundred miles away from Whitehorse, atNorman Wells in the Mackenzie flats. The main obstacle is the barrier of theRocky Mountains lying between Whitehorse and Norman Wells. But the engineers on the job exclaim: &quot;&quot;To hell with the Rocky Mountains! &quot;9. Oil was being produced from a single well at Norman before the warstarted. It is fuel of excellent quality. So now the production is beingstepped-up as rapidly as possible. The production figure originally aimed at by the authors of the scheme was 3,000 barrels a day. and they roughly estimatedthat perhaps as many as 30 wells would be required to achieve that figure.But already some half-dozen wells have been developed to the production stage,and their capacity has exceeded expectation. Some of them have not been properly tested and have had to be &quot; capped &quot; for the time being, because neitherthe pipe-line to carry the oil away nor adequate tankage to store it at NormanWells have yet been provided. But the evidence seems to show that most if not all of these wells will produce three or four or even more hundred barrels of oila day. Therefore many authorities at Norman now consider that much fewer than 30 wells will attain 3,000 barrels a clay, and that a much larger productioncan be comfortably achieved if necessary. Other authorities, however, still speakmore cautiously of the future.10. The production side of the business is therefore proceeding satisfactorilyso far. The erection of a pipe-line to convey the oil to Alaska has not made thesame good progress. At the best of times the problem of conveying fromEdmonton to Norman Wells about 1,200 miles away the immense length of 4-inchpipe and all the other equipment required to accomplish the task is difficult.These supplies cover the first 300 miles of the journey by rail. But after thatthere is neither rail nor road. The customary route is by boat down theAthabaska River, across a small space of Lake Athabaska, down the Slave River,across a large stretch of Great Slave Lake and along the Mackenzie River toNorman Wells. Some of the freight can be carried in aircraft, and adequateair transport is now being developed.   But this cannot carry the heavier loads.11. The first difficulty on the v/aterways was lack of sufficient boats. the americans, however, have now built the boats. The second difficulty was moreformidable. It was Great Slave Lake. This is one of the most treacherouswater passages in the wTorld. The lake is broad, shallow and exposed, and whenthe wind blows straight at it from the Arctic its choppy waves are the grave ofany unwary craft. They have been an obstacle to explorers and voyagers fromthe days of Sir Alexander Mackenzie onwards, and are proving uo more amenable to exasperated American engineers to-day. Six precious bull-dozers and someother vehicles are already nestling in the mud at the bottom of the lake, andtheir loss has been a serious deterrent to the American attempt to hustle thenorthern lakes and forests. Colonel Wyman, the experienced American officer who is in charge of the laying of the pipe-line, told me that he would &quot;ratherbring the stuff across the Pacific Ocean than across Great Slave Lake.&quot; He oughtto know, because until six months ago he was constructing the line of militaryairfields across the ocean from the United States of America to Australia.12. The third difficulty in the way of transport this year has been created by forest fires. This has been a remarkably diy season in the north, so fires galoreare raging. Consequently, a thick pall of smoke, as dense as a bad fog, has hungover the whole country between Edmonton and Great Slave Lake week after week,at a time when air and river transport is usually very active. For long periodsevery aeroplane in the place has been grounded, and small craft like scows havebeen tied up. The pipe and much other important equipment got strandedhundreds of miles south of where it was needed.13. However, these difficulties are being overcome as quickly as possible.But the proposal to start the actual laying of the pipe-line this year has been abandoned. The surveying of the best route over the plain and across the RockyMountains is proceeding, but the laying of the pipes is now postponed until the ice and snow have loosed their grip on the land next spring. Those responsiblehope to complete the work before another winter can intervene.[24490] . b 2
14. Some well-qualified judges doubt whether the Americans&apos; present plan will ever work effectively. They think it would he wiser not to take the pipe-linedue west from Norman Wells and across the Rockies to Whitehorse, but to leadit in a north-westeriy direction from its starting-point, keeping it in the lowercountry east of the mountains until it can outflank $heir northern tip and continue over easy ground to Fairbanks in Alaska, giving Whitehorse a miss.This would be a longer but more practicable route, the sceptics say.15. But the Americans and the experienced Canadian who is their chiefsurveyor are detennined to make a direct assault upon the Rockies, seeking outthe mountain passes. Even by this route the pipe-line will be about 500 mileslong. It will cross three distinct mountain ranges, climbing from 200 feet abovesea level at Norman Wells to about 4,500 feet at the highest point of its journey.The temperature in those parts may fall as low as 50c or 60o below zero inthe winter. But laboratory tests show that the oil continues to flow at atemperature of 70c below zero. So there is no need to sink the pipe-line under-ground; it will be built over the surface of the ground and covered with earthand moss, which, in any case, is a good insulator against cold.16. Certain minor difficulties are inevitably associated with all these works.Generally, the qualities of ability and tact in the American officers in charge oftheir sections of the undertakings are impressive, the conduct of their troops(including battalions of negroes) has been good, and relations between them andthe Canadian authorities are excellent. But some of the Americans throw theirweight about in an unfortunate manner, and the fact that the pay of Americancivilian workers on these projects is about double that of the Canadian is alsoperhaps storing up friction between them for the future. The customary troublesconnected with wine and women (though not yet noticeably with song) are nowinvading the north, and. setting a few posers for the Yukon and North-WestTerritories authorities. Another severe difficulty is mosquitoes. Nature issending her air-squadrons to attempt to defeat the violation of her virgin wilder-ness. Some of the insects are of a devilish size. I was told of an occasionwhen one of them alighted on the runway of an airfield and was filled up witheighty-seven gallons of petrol before the airman realised it was a mosquito andnot a bomber. But none of these various difficulties are being allowed to hamperthe progress of the vital defence works.17. The figures in all the above paragraphs were given me by high Americanor Canadian officers engaged on the undertakings. I presume that they arecorrect.Redskins, Trappers, Eskimos, &amp;c.18. We had many interesting and entertaining experiences amongst theregular inhabitants of the north, with which I need not trouble you. But it willgratify you to know how eagerly these remote people are following the fortunes ofthe war. For example, many of the white trappers and some of the better-offIndians and Eskimos possess portable wireless sets. When they disappear intothe northern forests, the Barren Lands or the Arctic islands for the long winter months of trapping they take these prized instruments with them so that theymay keep in touch with events in the outside world. It is strange to think of thesemen, often living in solitude amidst the ice and snow with only their dog-teamsas companions, travelling along their trap-lines to secure their catch of fox,marten, mink and other fur-bearing animals and tuning-in their wireless setseach day to catch also the latest news from the distant war fronts.19. These sturdy men are eager to play their part in the world-widestruggle of Liberty against Tyranny. Usually the white traders and. trappersare too old to make any contribution other than taxes. These they pay with enthusiasm! Some of them make good money. Thus, we spent one day someseventy miles north of the Arctic Circle in the small summer settlement of half-a-dozen white trappers and traders. One or two of them had already departedfor the season&apos;s work on their trap-lines, but the others had lingered to greet us.Most of these six men had immigrated into Canada as young prospectors, hadtaken part in the Gold, Rush to the Klonclyke in &apos;98, and have been trading ortrapping in the Arctic ever since. They are a cosmopolitan company of old boys an Englishman (from Yorkshire), a Canadian, an American, a Norwegian, aDane and a Pole, whilst the married men amongst them have Indian wives and
their children are half-breeds. This year those half-dozen citizens paid theCanadian Government more than $3,000 in income tax, and their eyes sparklewith pleasure as they speak of that contribution to the undoing of Hitler.20. The Indians and Eskimos do not pay income tax. But many of them also do their bit. For example, we stayed two days in the Indian village of OldCrow on the banks of the Porcupine River in the Arctic, a redskin communitycontaining only 150 inhabitants counting every man, woman and child.. A yearago their chief turned up one afternoon at the local Royal Canadian MountedPolice post and handed the corporal in charge $393. The villagers hadspontaneously collected this, and asked that it should be sent across the continent and the ocean as a gift to London children who had been orphaned in air raids.Since that gift they have collected close on another $500 for other war charities.Fruits of the Soil.21. We watched the gold dredges at work in Bonanza and other creeks onthe Klondyke. The company expect to produce about $2,500,000 worth of goldthis year, but their operations look like being restricted thereafter by shortage oflabour. Gold-mining operations at Yellowknife, on the shore of Great SlaveLake, are being steadily reduced for the same reason. Tungsten is being foundthere in various places, and is being sought elsewhere in the north, but has notyet been discovered in worth-while quantities. At Great Bear Lake we saw theradium miners hard at work.22. On our way north, crossing more than a thousand miles of prairie fromEastern Manitoba to the Peace River country, we saw the largest crop of goldencorn that has ever been grown in Canada being harvested. The experts inWinnipeg are still expecting a yield of 550 million bushels. The Granary of democracy is filled to bursting-point.I have, &amp;c.MALCOLM MacDONALD.
