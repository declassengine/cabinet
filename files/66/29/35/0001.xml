THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOV^RN^MEN&apos;Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 455.ensure the secrecy oi i --a diviimcfOctober 9, 1942.WAR CABINET.UNITED STATES COLOURED TROOPS IN THEUNITED KINGDOM.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.THE War Office Memorandum (W.P. (42) 441) and the Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (42) 442) put forward differingviews as to the proper handling of this difficult subject by the British Authorities,and I should like to submit some considerations which support the view takenby the Colonial Office. My own reflections and experience lead me strongly toaffirm the view of the Secretary of State for the Colonies that any lead givento the British people in this country, asking them to adopt the attitude of theAmerican Army towards coloured people, whether American or others, is likelyto cause serious resentment among coloured people who are British subjects,and also to cause confusion and even protest and resentment in the minds of the public here who have been asked repeatedly to accept British colouredColonial persons on equal terms and to extend to them hospitality andfriendliness.   I would ask attention to the following points : 1. The British attitude to coloured people is in fact widely different fromthe American attitude. There are historic and social reasons which ma3r explainthis, but the fact is undeniable. Anyone acquainted with the Southern Statesknows to what lengths the attitude adopted by the Whites against the Blackssometimes goes. I feel sure that British opinion would never accept, for example,provisions requiring coloured people to travel only in &quot; Jim Crow &quot; cars, to sit on separate seats in the parks, to- abstain from entering cinemas to which whitepeople resort, and so forth. We cannot ask people to adopt the Americanattitude on the colour question without asking them to set aside the Britishtradition.2. No colour bar is observed in. the Service Clubs run by the voluntary organisations which are officialy recognised by the War Office; for example,St. Stephen&apos;s Club, Westminster, is being used as a Toe H Services Club.Soldiers wearing a British uniform whether white or coloured resort to theClub. I am told that a number of American coloured troops have already usedit. Would it be consistent with British principles and traditions for the british authorities to say that such a place must not be entered by American coloured troops ? I should think it would be equally difficult to persuade Salvation Armycanteens or services like the Y.M.C.A. or the Church Army to adopt such adiscrimination. It is, I understand, the policy of the British Service Clubs to admit coloured troops, and I submit that the British Government ought not to seek to get that policy in any way changed.3. As to licensed premises, I do not think that the holder of a publican&apos;slicence would have any right to refuse to admit and serve coloured men. He getshis monopoly by a grant from the Magistrates because his house is &quot; public,&quot;&apos;&apos;-.e., ready to serve anybody who is not drunk and who behaves himself.[24471]
4. The British Empire is, on the whole, a coloured Empire, and it is hardlynecessary to emphasise what the reactions might be in the Empire if we took awrong course on this subject.5. I appreciate that the War Office proposal does not necessarily go to theselengths, but I question whether it is possible to go as far as the War Officeproposes and stop there. Surely the Colonial Office Paper is right in saying&quot; I consider that it is going much too far to attempt to ask the British Armyor the A.T.S. to adopt the attitude of the American Army towards Americancoloured people. It should be impressed upon our Service personnel that thisis an American and not a British problem.&quot;6. My own conviction is that if a mistake is made by yielding to Americansentiments and issuing orders which involve the British Government in thepractice of segregation, we are likely to raise a much greater storm than maybe realised in some quarters. There is a profound British conviction underneaththe surface in most of us that if a coloured man behaves himself he is entitledto the same treatment as a white man.7. I submit, therefore, that instead of urging our own people to adoptAmerican practices in this matter, we should explain to the American ArmyAuthorities that we, too, have traditional methods in connexion with coloured people and that we can take no action which would be a departure from them.The problem, which is undoubtedly a difficult one, is a problem for the american military Authorities, who, if they wish, can put places out of bounds, &amp;c.8. As for the allegation that there are some white women in this country who feel that American coloured troops are particularly attractive and whorun after them, that is a difficulty which will not be cured by keeping Americancoloured troops out of canteens or clubs at all. The great mass of white womencertainly have no such feelings, and I believe that the great mass of Americancoloured men are perfectly well conducted. In any case, barring Americancoloured troops from canteens, clubs, &amp;c., will not reduce the risk of association with white women in the least rather the opposite.S.House of Lords, October 9, 1942.
