THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1942.SECRET Copy No.  30W.P. (42) 469.October 14, 1942.WAR CABINET.MORALE IN ITALY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues herewith a paper on morale in Italywhich represents the agreed views of the various Departments concerned withthis question, including the Service Departments.A. E.Foreign Office,October 14, 1942.ANNEX.Italian Morale.IN considering Italian morale it must be remembered that Mussolini&apos;declaration of war never evoked any enthusiasm. It was thought that at worstthe Duce&apos;s action implied little more than the staking of claims against GreatBritain and France, whose collapse seemed imminent; the resultingdisappointment when it became apparent that Italy wras committed to a longand arduous war led to a general feeling of apathy towards it.2. This lukewarm spirit no doubt accounts very largely for the reverses inAlbania, Libya and East Africa, and Italian morale reached a very low level inthe winter of 1940-41. Mussolini lost much of his popularity, and discontentwith the regime was so widespread that after six months of war it seemed possiblethat the Duce might be overthrown and Italy might be detached from the Axis.3. Hitler, however, lost no time in forestalling such a possibility. Not .onlydid he retrieve the military position in the Balkans and Libya but, owing to hishold over Mussolini and the Fascist Party and by the presence in Italy (though not for the express purpose of intimidation) of one of the German Air Fleets ofGerman army formations in transit and the Gestapo, he created an atmosphere of fear and suspicion which would stifle any attempt at revolt. Apart from the nazi grip it may also be said that the individualism of the Italian which had made it difficult for Fascism to whip up collective enthusiasm now impeded thepossibility of organised resistance.4. At the beginning of 1941, as stated above, morale reached a low ebb. butrose to a certain extent as a result of Axis victories in the Balkans and Libya,declined again with Germany&apos;s attack on Russia, while the extension of the war to Japan and the U.S.A. have added to the prevailing gloom as it becomesincreasingly obvious that the end of the war is further off than ever. In recent-months the rapid capture of Tobruk may. have produced feelings akin toenthusiasm but the failure to follow up this success with the occupation of Egypthas no doubt brought home the fact that such successes can only prolong the war,which many Italians in any case do not expect to win.5. There has been dissatisfaction in Sicily necessitating the wholesaletransfer of Civil Servants from that island to other parts of Italy and air raidsare said to have had considerable effect on civilian morale both in Sicily and11877   [24496]
Southern Italy. Strikes and food riots are also reported but the Italian canadapt himself to a very low standard of living and he accepts cold and evenhunger with resignation. Evidence of difficulties within the regime has beenprovided by the dismissal of Ministers and minor officials and recently over60.000 persons were expelled from the Fascist Party. Nevertheless, dislike andfear of Germany, discontent with the regime and hunger have only succeeded in producing apathy and there is no evidence of any sabotage excepting throughpeasant hoarding and evasion of rationing regulations, the prevalence of blackmarkets and lack of discipline in the administration of industrial and economic affairs. Nor is there any evidence of organised opposition to the regime, oreven of embryo plans for an internal upheaval. Mussolini is still in control andcommands the self-interested obedience of the Fascist Party machine. The royal family, formerly counted on as a counterweight to Mussolini, no longer appearto be seriously looked to for a lead. Generals such as Bado^lio seem to be toowell guarded to have any prospect of forming any anti-Mussolini movementround them and there are no signs of any serious disaffection in the armed forces.6. At the same time, there are certain latent factors which, if conditionsare at a later date propitious, might rouse the average Italian from the prevailingmood of apathy and generate a spirit of active opposition to the present rulers ofItaly and the German stranglehold. The educated classes, while accepting the fascist system so long as it worked, have as a whole always disliked it and nowseem to appreciate that the results of that system are the disasters of the war andthe war itself. Mistrust and dislike of Fascism is growing among the masses, whoare now feeling the real effects of the corruption and favouritism of the system.The armed forces, moreover, are, at the moment, considerably extended and largegarrisons have to be maintained in the Balkans. It is possible that disaffectionmight arise among the troops of occupation in that area as a result of Alliedsuccesses elsewhere. The effect of this would be twofold; discontent would spread to the homeland, on the one hand, while, on the other, Germany would have tosend her own troops to replace Italians and under present conditions these couldill be spared.7. As regards the future, the latent unpopularity of the Fascist system,coupled with an almost universal dislike of the Germans, might be capable ofprovoking an explosion if conditions of living deteriorated, Italy suffered severereverses in Africa and Italian towns were subjected to widespread and continuous bombing. For such an explosion to pass to the stage of a majorevent such as the overthrow of Mussolini and the Fascist Party, or over-tures for a separate peace, two factors would be essential pre-requisites. Thefirst is the emergence of an alternative leader : though none has arisen either in Italy or abroad, this possibility should not be excluded in a country whichhabitually throws up leaders from among the masses. The second postulate would,be impotence on the part of the Germans to control the situation. At presentthe Fascist Party is sufficienly strong to suppress any potential leader, and theGermans, who are not appreciably extended by the existing measure of control exercised by them, would probably be in a position, at some sacrifice to their resources in other areas, to maintain the Fascist Party in power by force and snip.any incipient revolt in the bud. It seems unlikely, therefore, that unrest couldever reach dangerous dimensions until Germany had reached the point of being unable to spare the necessary forces to increase her grip on Italy, i.e., untilGermany^ herself was nearing dissolution. Any signs of dissolution in Germanmorale would have an especially marked effect in the Italian forces. As a resultof German stiffening the Italians in Libya have recently fought comparativelywell; if this stiffening were removed, the decline in the Italian will to fight wouldprobably be extremely rapid.8.   To sum up : -(i) At present Italian morale has sunk to a condition of general apathyand does not impose any severe strain on Germany,(ii) A deterioration in living conditions, severe reverses in Africa and widespread and continuous bombing of Italian towns would probablyproduce such conditions of increased discontent and tendencies torevolt as to force the Germans considerably to reinforce their grip on italy, with a consequent increased drain on German resources,(iii) Discontent is unlikely to reach dimensions dangerous for the Fascistregime so long as Germany has forces available to maintain her control,i.e., until Germany herself is reaching breaking-point.
