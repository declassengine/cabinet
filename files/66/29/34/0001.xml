SB C R E. T COPT NOff.P. (42) 454gth October! 1942*WAR ; cabinet report ON HOME OPINIONMeraarjanjium by the, ? Sinister of information the fourth winter of the war falls on a public not flagging or out of heartbut for the time being much more preoccupied -with the unavoidable difficultiesof every day life than with the larger issues of the progress of the war or of world politics,   A year ago there were many to believe that the end of the war was not far off and that we should not have to spend another winter in theshelters:   now the expectation of a speedy end. to the war seems to have fadedaltogether and people have settled down to a steady plugging away at the Dobsthat immediately concern theuu2,       Much of this might change overnight with an intensification of our share in military operations *   In the meantime hopes are uncertain whilepractical problems are real.   Indeed, post-war conditions seem to be more a cause of anxiety as to what they may bring to the individual in the shape ofunemployment and distress than of hope for the blessings that they may bring to the nation at larger   Criticism of the management of the production sideof the war which was so vigorous and widespread earlier this year has mainlydied away; so has critism of the Government itself.     The House of Commons,on the other hand, has not enjoyed the same imimxnity, the Lord Privy seal scomment on members * attendance in the House having been received withvigorous and sustained approval.3 *       The war news that has dominated men&apos;s minds throughout the period isthe battle of Stalingrad,   Every week of successful defence confirms thepopularity of the Russians and there is much uneasiness and unhappinessat the spectacle of our apparent inaction, , For this reason a piece of newssuch as the passing of the recent convoy to Russia is received with realpleasure.4* But uneasiness and unhappiness do not now feed any clamour for a second front, $hen one compares the public feeling on this subject in September1942 with the feeling a year ago, it is remarkable how great the change hasbeen. As a political issue it has ceased to count. There is much greaterawareness of the tremendous gravity of such an undertaking; and the publicseems satisfied to accept thxA &quot;prodding&quot;, whether of military or political leaders, is neither wise nor necessary,5*    No single factor has contributed more powerfully to bring this aboutthan the news of the Dieppe raid.   It has all along been widely believed thatthe raid was intended to be &quot;the Second Front&quot;, or that it would have turnedinto one if operations had gone more favourably.   The first impact of the news was highly stimulating, and it is reported that in many factories itlent an appreciable impetus to production.   Gradually, however, it came tobe realised that serious difficulties had been encountered and heavy lossessuffered; and the public, seeing for the first time as it were the openingphases of a landing enaoted, appear to have drawn a grim moral&apos; from what theysavr,,6* The review oomes back in the end to the fact that the public are regarding&quot;kho coming winter with foreboding as a period dominated rmt by hunger but byoold, darkness and irksome transport difficulties.   The prospect of air raidsSrows more formidable.   It is on these practical things that their attentionV/ill mainly be concentrated,(this ixxmsm. is gas, frootpy of his BEOTAinng majesty1s GoyemENT)&apos;
B.B.9th 0otober,l%2.7*        The public are taking fuel oconomy to heart and arc making seriousefforts to meet the Government&apos;s appeal, but they find it so hard tounderstand why this country should be short of coal that their efforts areaccompanied by resentment against what they describe as Government mis-management in having allowed the present situation to come about.,   Theydo not look forward to&quot; rationing with apprehension, for not only has their experience of commodity rationing been favourable hitherto^ but they havealso derived real satisfaction from the thought that whatever supplies areavailable are being shared out on an equitable &quot;basis unaffected by theinfluence of privilege or money.   Finally, the readiness of response fromthe lower income groups is affected by the feeling that they have never beenable to afford to do otherwise than economise in fuel and that the range inwhich saving ought to. he sought is amongst the higher income groups oocupyijv.the larger houses.
