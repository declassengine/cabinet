THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;S fiOVE-RNMJENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1942.101SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 445.October 5, 1942.30WAR CABINET.TREATMENT OF WAR CRIMINALS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AT a conference of the Allied Governments in London, held last Januaryat St. James&apos;s Palace, at which I was present as an observer on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, a resolution was adopted calling for the punishment ofwar crimes through the channels of organised justice. Since that time, the AlliedGovernments in London have renewed their pressure on His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto make clear their own policy towards this question. They have represented in particular that such a statement would prove encouraging to their own peoplesin the occupied countries of Europe. Those responsible for our own propagandahave supported this view.2. A preliminary study of the whole question and its legal implicationswas accordingly undertaken in  he Foreign Office, and the results circulated tothe War Cabinet (see W.P. (42) 264). On the basis of this paper, the WarCabinet decided to set up a Ministerial Committee under the Lord Chancellor&apos;chairmanship to investigate the matter.3.   This Committee&apos;s investigations followed two main lines : (1) They prepared a statement of the preliminary views of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment regarding general principles which should govern the punishment of war criminals. This was communicated to the AlliedGovernments in London and to the French National Committee at ameeting in the Foreign Office on the 6th August. It was alsocommunicated to the United States, Soviet and Chinese governments and to the Dominions Governments.(2) The committee, on the basis of a paper produced by Mr. Hopkins to giveeffect to a suggestion of the Prime Minister&apos;s, produced two paperssetting forth the scope and functions of an international fact-findingcommission, which it was proposed should be established to investigateevidence of atrocities, particularly organised atrocities, submitted bythe Governments of the United Nations, and .to report back to those governments the results of its investigations. It was proposed that membership of this committee should be confined to nationals of theUnited Nations. At the committee&apos;s request, these papers were com-municated by the United States Ambassador to President Rooseveltwith a request for his views.4. Meanwhile, pressure has increased upon His Majesty&apos;s Government tomake a statement. In particular, Lord Maugham has expressed the wish tointroduce a motion on the subject into the House of Lords. This motion hasbeen postponed for a month in order to give the United States Government timeto formulate their views on the fact-finding commission proposals, but is now togo forward on the 7tlh October, and it is not felt possible to ask Lord Maughamto agree to further delay.11866   T24441]
5. It is accordingly proposed that in reply to this motion the LordChancellor shall make a statement on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government. this statement will cover two main points. It will declare that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment think it desirable to set up a United Nations fact-finding commissionon the lines indicated above. It will also state that, in response to a request bythe Allied Governments in London, His Majesty&apos;s Government are in favourof including in any eventual armistice terms provision for the immediate captureand surrender of wanted criminals, rather than allow such measures to wait untilthe conclusion of peace treaties. This point was in fact one of those included inthe document setting forth the preliminary views of His Majesty&apos;s Government,which was communicated to the Allied Governments, and the latter had requested that His Majesty&apos;s Government should forthwith declare their adoption of it.6. The United States Government have throughout been kept fully informed of His Majesty&apos;s Governments intentions and the hope has been expressed that they will be able to let us have their views on the detailed arrangements proposed for the fact-finding commission before the proposed statement is made. They have already informed us of their concurrence in theproposed statement on the subject of dealing writh the question of war criminalsin the armistice; and the original proposal for a commission came from theUnited States Government.7. The Soviet and Chinese Governments and the Allied Governments inLondon, the French National Committee, the Dominions Governments and theGovernments of India and Burma have also been informed of His Majesty&apos;governments intended statement and invited to associate themselves with thepolicy proposed. It is hoped that replies may be received from at least someof these Governments in time for a reference to their attitude to be includedin the statement.8. The Governments concerned have been informed that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment regard this statement as a further step forward towards the formulation of a common policy on the subject of war criminals, and intend toenter into further consultation with those Governments regarding the detailed application of the measures proposed.A.
