E.Foreign Office, September 26, 1942.Annex.MORALE IN GERMANY.DURING the winter of 1941/1942 German civilian morale was profoundlyshaken. The failure to break Soviet resistance and the entry of the United Statesinto the war brought home for the first time to the German people that finalvictory was uncertain and that the war might he long. Hitler&apos;s assumption ofthe supreme command of the army on the 21st December, 1941, helped to stema serious decline of confidence; and a progressive campaign of &quot; blood and tears &quot;propaganda throughout the winter succeeded in stiffening, though not materiallyraising, German morale.Among the symptoms of shaken morale were apathy and scepticism aboutwar news; an increase of rumours and belief in rumours; lack of response to a renewed anti-semitic drive; increased distrust of the value of money; the revival of the production and dissemination of subversive literature; increased appetitefor foreign propaganda (both broadcasting and leaflets); and a religious revival,which indicated declining faith in national socialism. How powerful these factors were is shown by the attention given to them even in the Nazi home press and wireless.In countering these symptoms, the German Government could rely on theinnate patriotism and obedience of the German and his fear of the consequences of defeat, e.g., revenge by all the oppressed peoples, and, in particular, by theRussians, inflation, anarchy and unemployment. Exploitation of these factorsby the Propaganda Ministry, coupled with an ever more ruthless use of themachinery of repression, has had a considerable effect in inducing widespreadresignation to the idea of a long and hard war. The effect of the efforts of the propaganda Ministry is accentuated by the absence of any belief in a tolerablefuture for the German people in the event of defeat.In spite of the successes achieved in the East, in Libya and in the U-boatwarfare, morale has risen only slightly this summer and remains spiritless.

is due partly to a growing realisation of the very heavy cost of the war on theEastern Front, partly to the serious deterioration in living conditions in recent months as shown in the great accentuation of already grave housing problems asa result of air raids, in fuel and transport difficulties, in the further tighteningof police supervision, in more stringent measures of labour mobilisation, especially of women, and in attempts to speed up work still further; partly also, andmore particularly in the areas affected, to the severity of air raids and the fearof worse to come. The adverse effect on morale of the drastic cuts in food rationslast April has no doubt been partly offset by the recent announcement that meat and bread rations will be increased next month, but the fear regarding the futurefood situation still persists. While it is difficult at present to assess the generalinfluence on morale of the greater weight of air raids, there is no doubt that theyare increasing the physical and nervous strain on the population.It would,&quot; however, be incorrect and dangerous to believe that the state ofGerman civilian morale will at this stage appreciably affect the German war effort. There has been some loss of efficiency in industry, primarily as a resultof administrative difficulties, over-strain and absenteeism; the peasants are beginning to show resistance to administrative measures; the foreign workers who are being introduced in increasing numbers are proving a disruptingelement; the bureaucratic machine is being over-driven. But, although theseindications of strain and war weariness are causing serious concern to the GermanGovernment, none of them should be read as indicating the emergence of aconscious and effective political opposition. Elements of opposition, no doubt,exist, but the power of the S.S. and the party is such that tJheir chance of being able to. influence the course of events is negligible.Hitler is no doubt gambling on having achieved by the autumn such successesin the East that, though they may not necessarily be conclusive this year, theywill make an ultimate Allied victory extremely difficult. German civilian morale,on the other hand, is tending more and more to be influenced by hopes of a corn-promise peace with Great Britain and the United States, though on terms which from our point of view would be indistinguishable from a major Germanvictory. The success of the campaign in the East will be judged to a consider-able extent in the light of the prospects of the realisation of such hopes. If theyare disappointed, serious reactions may follow which will call for a furthertightening of the terror machine. But, provided that the army&apos;s.morale remainsunimpaired, civilian morale will stand up to another war winter, and the worstthat the German Government need fear from the home front is a rapidlydiminishing return from its increased use of terrorism. Only if symptoms ofdeterioration begin to spread to the armed services or seriously to influence theestimate in the highest quarters of the likelihood of a German defeat can a development of those fissures in ruling circles be expected which must be - theopening phase of a German collapse.The morale of the German army and air force is still high and there are no signs of any deterioration as yet. German naval morale also remains high.There is no general dissatisfaction with service conditions in the navy, but thereare incipient signs of anxiety about conditions at home. The fear of retributionand vengeance if Germany is defeated is strong among naval prisoners.
