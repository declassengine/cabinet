The following recent sinkings havebeen reported, some of which may have been due to the new type of mine : (i) Recently the German cargo ship Hamburg of 5-6,000 tons was indock at Copenhagen being repaired after hitting a magnetic mine.(ii) On the 7th-8th September the Swedish wireless announced that theSwedish steamer Tynninghoe of 4,272 tons was mined off the GermanNorth Sea Coast.(iii) On the 17th September a steamer was damaged by striking a mine onthe Kattegat.(iv) On the 19th- September the Danish Koldinghus (6,742 tons) sank inAalborg Bay.(v) On the 19th September the Danish wireless announced that a steamersank in the Kattegat, south of the Oestre lighthouse.(vi) On the 24th September the Finnish Freighter Navigator (8,000 tons),vyith a cargo of ore, was damaged off Trelleborg.(vii) On the 25th September the Dutch steamer Vledderveen (133 tons) sankin the Sound.(viii) On the 17th August the German transport Wuri (7,000 tons) was mined and sank off Limfjord in the Kattegat. She carried 500 G.A.F.mechanics and 1,000 other men and equipment. 400 casualties were landed at Aalborg, and it is known that at least 100 men were lost.Operational Achievements.2. Bad weather has seriously restricted reconnaissance during the part fortnight; consequently there is little information available about results of attacks, some of which are known to have been successful.Bremen (13th/14th September).3. After the raid on 4th/5th September it was estimated that about one-fifth of the centre of the city had been demolished. 448 aircraft, including 138drawn from training units, attacked again on 13th/14th September. There is evidence that by the end of the attack fires had. obtained a good hold and thatconcentrated damage was caused both in the city and in a large industrial area in the South-Eastern suburbs.The &quot; Solglimt &quot; (15th September).4. The Norwegian whale oil factory ships Solglimt (12,246 tons) andOlewegger were captured by a German raider in the Antarctic and sent toBordeaux with prize crews.&apos; Recently both ships made their way up the WestCoast of France and into the Channel. Olewegger is now at Rouen, but Solglimtwas sunk on the 15th September by Bostons of No. 2 Group at Cherbourg. (print. 1.) Subsequent photographs show the ship lying on her port side with watercovering her decks.Wilhelmshaven (14th/15th September).5. Although activity at Wilhelmshaven is now much reduced, it is stillproducing a few submarines, and carrying out repair work to naval units. It willbe recalled that the raid on the 8th/9th July resulted in widespread damage on three sides of the Bauhafen, including the submarine building yard; on the14th/15th September 202 aircraft attacked again. A good concentration of aircraft was achieved over the city and harbour, and large fires and explosionswere seen.  The attack is thought to have been most effective.
Essen (16th/17th September).6. A force of 369 aircraft, including 126 drawn from training units, was directed against Essen. Cloud over the target was greater than expected, andthis, together with the industrial smoke always present and the density of the defences, made the task the most difficult undertaken in recent weeks. Nightphotographs indicate that a considerable proportion of the force dropped theirbombs near Essen, while some crews definitely found and bombed either the townor Krupps&apos;s works. Results cannot be assessed until day photographs have beentaken.Reports continue to be received concerning damage done to Krupps and workers&apos; houses by the &quot; 1,000 raid &quot; on the lst/2ncl June. Hitherto these reports have not been quoted in view of the lack of supporting photographicevidence, but their number is such that some credence can now be given to them.It is said that the section of Krupps making Flak was put out of action; thatthe boiler works, rolling-mill and a foundry were hit, and that the main timberstore was completely destroyed. 500-600 buildings are said to have been severely damaged. Another source states that, owing to the high proportion of nightwork in Essen, casualties were heavier there on the night of the 1st/2nd Junethan in Cologne on the night of the 30th-31st May.These results may have been achieved by a small proportion of the total forceonly, since it is known that the main weight of this attack fell on Oberhausen,where damage was very great.Munich and Saarbrucken (19th/20th September).7. 90 Heavies attache J Munich while another force of 118 aircraft attackedSaarbrucken. Details of results cannot yet be given, but an assessment of damage at Munich will be available for the next Summary.Ijmuiden (22nd September).Lille Bethune Area8. Low-level attacks were carried out in daylight by Mosquitos against the steel works at Ijmuiden, and led by Bostons against the important group of power stations in the Lille and Bethune areas. Photographs taken at very low level during the attacks show7 many hits with delayed action bombs.Oslo (25th September).9. At the request of the Norwegian Government an attack was carried outon the Gestapo Headquarters in Oslo.It was known that an important Nazi-Quisling rally was to be held in the afternoon and that the morale of the loyal Norwegians was sinking as the timedrew near because they feared that Quisling&apos;s powers would be increased. Itwas thought that a demonstration of our determination to support the loyalelements would raise their spirits and indirectly increase the Nazi&apos;s problemsof internal security.Pour Mosquitos reached Oslo as Quisling was making his speech. They flewat roof-top height and had no difficulty in identifying the Gestapo building withits Nazi flag. Bombs hit the centre and both wings of the building; a photographtaken by the leader is attached showing a direct hit with his first bomb. (print. 2.) The aircraft were attacked before reaching the target and were chasedfor 30 miles after leaving it.   One was shot down into the Fiord.Flensburg (23rd/24th September).10. The submarine building yard was attacked by 28 aircraft. - Photo-graphic reconnaissance has not yet been possible.W ismar (23rd/24th September).11. 83 Lancasters attacked the town of Wismar and the Dornier aircraft factory nearby. Low cloud covered both targets, but some crews report that theywere able to find and bomb the factory and the town, and that they saw fires in both.   Weather has prevented photographic reconnaissance.Information regarding Previous Raids.Dusseldorf (10th/11th September).12.   It is now apparent that, measured by the extent of destruction to industries and communications, this attack was the most profitable of all our[24485] . * B 2
bombing raids, with the exception of that on Cologne on 30th/31st May. large areas were devastated in both Rostock and lubeck  but this did not result in morethan a fraction of the industrial damage done in dusseldorf.13. In Diisseldorfs 380 acres of complete devastation no less than 30factories and important works were either completely destroyed or so damagedthat output must be seriously curtailed. Among them were six factories makingsteel products or machinery, two factories making steel tubes, one makingmachine tools and magnetic mines, two chemical works and many other factoriesproducing a variety of commodities such as enamel, paper, boilers, wire, insulatingmaterials, railway wagons and harvesting machinery. This formidable list ofdestroyed or seriously damaged factories is additional to the 24 factories damaged in the raid of the last night of August.14. Communications were seriously affected by an 8,000-lb. bomb on tihemain railway station, and by another direct hit on the important railway junctionat Neuss. Considerable damage -was also caused to railway sheds and rolling-stock.15. Two prints (Nos. 3 and 4), showing typical devastated areas in thebusiness quarters of Diisseklorf, are attached, also a &quot; black-out &quot; print showingthe areas of complete devastation (No. 5). The estimate of 380 acres of completedevastation mentioned above does not include innumerable isolated incidents ofbomb and blast damage throughout the city and its suburbs.Karlsruhe (2nd/3rd September).16. Evidence of the great destruction wrought in Karlsruhe continues toflow in. Details of the more important industrial damage, together with extracts from reports of reliable ground sources, are given below : (i) 9 acres of the Junker und Ruh works, which makes mountings for machine guns, and14 acres of the Karl Metz factory, which makes fire-fighting equipment,totally destroyed,(ii) An electro-motor factory more than half destroyed.(iii) A textile factory and a dye works completely destroyed.(iv) 14  acres of a saw mill burnt out and the huge briquett stone house(417 yards x 85 yards) still on fire nine days after the raid.(v) The generating house of the main power station partly destroyed.(vi) Five railway repair shops destroyed; and much damage to the main station.(vii) &apos;&apos; Five days after the raid three quarters of the town was still withoutelectric current. The harbour was heavily damaged, many silos beingburnt out and cranes destroyed. 500 trucks of coal and 12 locomotiveswere destroyed.&quot;(viii) &quot; Over 800 houses have been heavily damaged.&quot;(ix) &quot; Several thousand inhabitants were evacuated 48 hours after the raid.There was evidence of panic.&quot;The total area of complete devastation, not including many isolated incidents of damage whose exact area cannot be assessed, is now estimated to be 300 acres.A &quot; black-out &quot; of Karlsruhe is attached.   (Print No. 6.)Duisburg (6th/7th September).17. Additional items of damage in Duisburg, resulting from the successfulraid of the 6th/7th September, are now revealed.A building 270x190 feet of an iron works has been completely gutted; atram depot, hit on a previous raid, further damaged; 5 buildings of a tobaccofactory gutted; 4 buildings of a chemical works severely damaged by fire; 2buildings of a starch factory destroyed.Cologne.18. The &quot; 1,000 raid &quot; on Cologne at the end of May is still seriouslyaffecting submarine production. The Deschimag Yard at Bremen, which is normally building and fitting out twenty-nine submarines, has received no partsfor diesel engines since the raid, and there is an acute shortage of inductiondistributor pumps. The two diesel-engine factories of Humboldt Deutz atCologne were both damaged in the raid and some of their sheds, thought to containstores, are known to have been gutted.
Two further items of important damage resulting from this raid may nowbe added to the enormous list of destruction (i) An Army depot containing spare engines for military vehicles was hit and over 1,000 engines were destroyed or damaged.(ii) The Administrative Headquarters for North-West Germany controlling the organisation of war industries was completely destroyed.Saargemiind.19. On the 1st/2nd September two important factories were damaged atSaargemiind, 10 miles south of saarbrucken; one made shells, the otherparachutes.The Reich&apos;s Rehousing Problem,20. The Appendix to this Summary gives a short note on the rehousingproblem, which has now become an important factor affecting not only the morale of the Reich&apos;s home front, but also the ability of German workers to maintainthe present rate of production.German Reactions to Bombing Raids.21.   A Prague paper : &quot; British bombers carried bombs of a size which had until now seemedimpossible. The German population are able to judge exactly andunmistakably the terrific effect of these new British weapons.&quot;A letter from Dortmund : &apos;&apos; The Tommies are doing what they like again. At night we go to bedfilled with terror.&quot;A letter from Altenstadt (near Kassel) : &quot; I am completely exhausted.   I cannot stand it any longer.&quot;Letters from Bremen : &quot; I am crying from fear.   I am surprised I have not gone out ofmy mind.&quot;&quot; The attacks are ghastly and our poor Bremen is like a ruin.&quot;&quot; The worry over whether one can retain one&apos;s goods and chattels through this murderous destruction is nerve-racking.&quot;Other extracts from intercepted letters : &quot; Hamburg is unrecognisable.   It looks as if an earthquake has takenplace.&quot;&quot; Very soon there won&apos;t be even ruins in our Duisburg.&quot;&quot; If the Tommies keep on bombing us like this Western Germany will soon cease to exist.&quot;&quot; I cannot understand what you are doing at the front that we shouldbe bombed four nights in succession.&quot;This is the sort of personal news which is spreading among the german troops in Russia and Egypt.A. H. M..S.October 13, 1942.APPENDIX.Note on Re-Housing Problem in the Reich.THERE is a growing body of evidence that, notwithstanding the directdamage to German industry that has been caused in recent attacks, the mostserious problem. confronting the German authorities is that of re-housing thebombed-out population and providing them with clothing and other necessities of life.
2.   The position to date may be summarised as follows : (i) Before the war, Germany was short of at least one and a half millionapartments, and building was stopped as soon as war began. Theabsence from home of Germans who are in the fighting forces has beenoff-set to some extent by the large bodies of foreign workers that havebeen brought into the country,(ii) The destruction of houses and other domestic property that has already occurred has led to a serious housing difficulty in the Rhinelancl,where every day accommodation has to be found. The extent of theproblem is such that a recently high German official travelled toBudapest in an endeavour to arrange for accommodation in Hungary.(iii) The position has been met up to the present by housing the people in temporary quarters which are unsuitable to the German winterconditions. At Bremen there is considerable concern as to what canbe done with the workers at the Focke-Wulf factory, who have lost their dwellings and who are temporarily re-housed under theseconditions, and this was prior to the recent successful attack upon that city, which must have greatly aggravated the problem.(iv) The German does not take kindly to billeting, and there is evidence of friction in houses where persons have been billeted on others.A Special Party Court has been set up to arbitrate in conflictsregarding housing. The feeling is on occasion so strong thatsentences up to two years&apos; imprisonment have been passed on people who have&apos;refused to take in evacuees.(v) Apart from the difficulty of re-housing, there is also the difficulty of supplying the necessary clothes and other amenities to those who have lost all their possessions. It is now a common feature, when a successful attack has been made, for an immediate suspension of theuse of clothes ration cards to be put into operation. This is to enablethe small stocks that are available to be supplied only to those whohave lost all their possessions in the attack.(vi) To bolster up morale, the Rhineland papers have recently containedarticles informing the population that claims should be made inrespect of damaged premises, and that State Grants would be madeto assist in rebuilding. It is not. however, stated when rebuildingwill commence.3. The further destruction of houses is considered to be of the greatest importance, especially as the approach of winter will accentuate the problem.The following are the principal factors : (i) The loss of one&apos;s home and possessions has been found in this countryto be one of the most important points with regard to morale.Judging by the strict measures in force to prevent information of theresults of air raids reaching the soldiers at the front, it would appearthat the German authorities are aware of the effect it may alsoproduce upon the morale of the fighting services,(ii) The damage is cumulative. Save only where slight damage has been caused, there has been no evidence of any attempt to rebuild or repair,as has happened in the case of factory premises, and it is consideredthat with the present shortage of labour, any such attempt can onlybe at the expense of factory repair work.4. The social and administrative difficulties of victualling and accommo-dating de-housed populations are more pronounced, and the effect on the moralemore widely distributed, when attacks are made on medium-sized towns whichare not close to any of the major centres of Germany. It is known that thepeople evacuated from Rostock to cities such as Hamburg, Berlin and Kiel spreadsuch alarm and despondency that they had to be recalled to their own homeprovince.
