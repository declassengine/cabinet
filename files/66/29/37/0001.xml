In view of latest developmentst War Cabinet have.again reviewed the position.     Following is statement of factswith our comments2t     On 2nd September the German High Command announced:&quot;The english Order captured near Dieppe - states inAppendix L paragraph 4, Figure E (2):3 forever it is possible * the hands of prisonerswill be bounds so&quot; that they cannot destroy theirpapers5 *This extract from the English Operational Order v?aspublished among other things in the official statement of-the German High Command of the 30th August1942.     The English Government has not defined its attitude to this*&apos; The German High Command have therefore ordered thatall the British Officers and 3oldiers taken prisonernear Dieppe will be placed in fetters as from 14,00on the 3rd Septembers      The reason for this treatmenthas been made known to the prisoners.     This measure will only be cancelled when the British Government-withdraws in an official pronouncement the instructiondecreed In the above mentioned order about thefettering of German prisoners of war0&quot;3e     The War Office issued the following statement on 2nd September?&quot;&quot;A German communique has stated that orders were   givenby, the British in the Dieppe operations that prisoners9hands should be tied to prevent them destroying their papers.Investigations are being made as to whether in. factany such order was issued,.      It is categorically denied that any German prisoner had his hands tied.     Any such orderif it was issued, will be cancelled,&quot;The Gex*man High Command issued on 3rd September astatement repeating the.War Office statement and saying&quot;On the strength of this Declarations the High command of tho German Armed Forces has lifted the reprisalmeasures, against British.prisoners of War announced onSeptember/
September 2nd.     The te*t of this British Declarationwill &quot;be made known to the British prisoners of war&amp;a well&quot;*4*     On enquiries &quot;being made it was found that the Orderreferred to in the German statement of 2nd September had &quot;been issued.In the view of the War Office this might be held to ijapiythat irrespective of the circumstances the hands of prisonersof war should &quot;be tied,     This might &quot;be regarded as contrary to the geneva Convention which, though it lays down nothing about tying thehands of prisoners of war prescribes humane treatment,5.     On the 7th october  German Government iSBued a furtherannouncement as follows:-&quot;After the abortive landing attempts at Dieppe, a capturedBritish Order demanding that German prisoners he fettered,forced the High Command of the Armed Forces to announcesuitable counter-measures for the protection of Germansoldiers - honour.     Thereupon the British V/ar Officedeclared on the 2nd September:Mt is emphatically denied that any German prisoner hashad his hands fettered.     Any such order, if it shouldhave &quot;been issued, will be revoked, &apos;lh the meantime, both declarations of the British War office have been proved to he either frivolous unverified assertions orconscious lies.For the examination in court of a Goman Lance Sergeant, aCorporal and five Privates as well as of five men of the organisationTodt, who temporarily.fell into British captivity at Dieppe and whowere later freed, makes it clear that they had all &quot;been fettered fromten minutes to one hour and a half.     Either their hands had &quot;been tiedon their backs, or their wrists; in some instances even their individual fingers had been tied together over their chests.This was not all:    a aimilar dastardly incident took placeon the Channel Islands of Sark on the 4th October.      Id the earlyhours of the morning, .16 British raided a German labour squad of one and four men.     These, dressed only in their shirts, were tiedup with a thin but very strong round plaited rope, prevented fromputting on any further clothes and marched to the &quot;beach.     When theGerman soldiers resisted this unheard of treatment, the N.C,o* andone man wore killed by shots and by thrusts with &quot;bayonet, and anothersoldier was wounded.     These facts are confirmed &quot;by the evidence of aSapper, who managed to escape in the affray.     The investigation hasevinced that the fettering had &quot;been prepared systematically,,The German High Command of the Armed Forces has thus in itBhands irrefutable proof of the two British War Office statements of2nd September having bee:* made untruthfully.The High Command of the Armed Forces therefore finds itselfcompelled to direct as follows:-Aa from 12 o&apos;cldck noon of the 8th October, ail british officers and soldiery captured at Dieppe will be laid in irons.This measure shall remain in force until such time as theBritish War office will give evidence that in future it willmake truthful statements cf the fettering of German prisonersof war or that it has ass timed authority to make sure its Ordeal-   are enforced with the troops.
In future, all terror and sabotage units of the BritJlsh,and their henchmen who behave not like soldiers hut like banditswill be treated as such by the German troops and vrherevei they appear, they will be finished off in ruthless struggle.&quot;6,     The War Office issued the following statement cn thssame day:-&quot;Enquirles were instituted after the Dieppe raid.All German priaoners-of-war brought back to the United kingdom were interrogated and unanimously declared they had nj?ji   had thsitfhands tied and had been given humane treatment.This statement can be proved by the G &amp; man Protecting power*Any of the prisoners can be seen by the representatives of theGerman Protecting power to confirm this.Th.5 evidence the enemy have adduced resvs on theirunsubstantiated assertions.There is full evidence of the humane treatment of prisoner ofwar by British troops and If the German Government carry out thethreats mentioned In their communique, she British Governmentwill have to consider their future actlcn.The raid on Sark was carried out by a party of ten officersand men.     Seven of the party went into an occupied house and captured five Germans.     The hancs of the Germans were tied inorder that arms might be linked v;ith thft captives.     No writtenOrders had been issued.     The prisoners had to be taken past aGerman occupied barracks to the boats and the precautions were therefore necessary.     In spite tff the y^ecautions, four of thefive German prisoners of war brote away shouting and had to beshot to prevent their raising th* alarm.&quot;Y*     On the next day, 8th October, His Majesty*s Governmentissued a further statement as follows:-&quot;Hie Majesty&apos;a&apos;Government repeat the declaration that they donot find will not countenance any orders for the tying of the hand^ of Prisoners of War taken in the field.The action of the German Government in taking reprisals againscthe British Prisoners of T7axv in tneir hands is expresslyforbidden by Article 2 of tho Geneva Convention.Nevertheless, should the German Government persist in tneirintentions, His majesty&apos;s Government will be compelled, in orderto protect their own Prisoners of War, to take similar measuresupon an equal number of enemy Prisoners of vrar in their hands.&quot;8.     The German High Command thereafter announced that theyhad p-at the Dieppe prisoners In. chains as from noon on 8th October,9.     The War Office thereupon issued the following statement:-&quot;The German Governments having put iuto operation the illegalaction threatened in their communique, the War Office announcesthat unless the German Government release the prisoners capturedat Dieppe from their chains, an equal number of German prisonersof war will be manacled and chained as from 12 noon, Saturday.10th October,MXO.    The German High Command issued the following on 9th October!&quot;Since
&quot;Since the announcement by the German. High Command cfOctober 7th. In which reprisal measures against the fettering (.tGerman prie oners at Dieppe and on the Island of Sank werfc iaod**known, the British Government have only made exmses, r^t^vx-tito statements of German war prisoners who were rot mar.? islivd and declared that t^ey do not and will not countenance th-; bindingof war prisoner? in the fields&apos;iSince &quot;&quot;he British Government has not referred io thi f at. t ^j,ainotwithstanding the former and the present hypocritical atalfr.menta of the British War Office German prisoners wtre fetters j a crude way, on October 8th at noon, W7 British Officers and1,269 N.C.Os, and men who were taken prisoner at Dieppe were ;r*in fetters after they had been informed of the reaspns,iChaplains, medical personnel^ wounded and sick wer* notmanacled.In the evening of October 8th the British &quot;ffar Office announce that an equal number of German prisoners will be manaclec&quot; and $in irons from October 10th onwards.If this should be done the German High Command will put h-Mfetters three tirues the number of British prisoners of war frwnoon on October ICth onwards,&quot;II. His Majesty&apos;a Government think that there is riPk of sowmisunderstanking as to what is or is net allowed in this matte?-IB. The Geneva Convention lays down the treatment to be accorded to prisoners ox&quot; wai&apos;. Clearly however wholly different conditions apply to prisoners in safe custody as contrasted withthe action of taking prisoners in the course of battle. In thalatter case the tying of a prisoner*e hands may be the only way o.Jpreventing him from escaping-; whlla being taken into custody; itmay indeed be the only alternative, to taking his life,13,    The German Government have now deliberately manacledprisoners of war in their custody and far removed from the battle,They have done this as a reprisal.      But reprisals are specificallyforbidden by the Geneva Convention. I14. His majesty Government r,hink it desirable that an earl;&apos;public statement should be issued baaed on the above and we hone tilet you hove the text of this as soon as possible.15.    In the War Cabinet*s view there is reason to think thatthe German action was prompted by. fear of our Commando raids andaimed at making them less effective.     His Majesty&apos;s government therefore propose that if the German Government, put into effecttheir threet to manacle three times the number of British prisonersof war, they, for their part , should increase correspondingly thenumber of -erman prisoners to be-manacled.     His Majesty*s \Government trust that this action, which has been forced upon us i will receive the approval and oo-operation of the dominion government:,,We should be grateful for earliest possible reply.

Bee my immediately following telegram for text of notification to Germanysent through Swiss representative0     We think It uiidv^undesirable that anyfigures indicating number of German prisoners handcuffed in canada and in United Kingdom respectively should be made publics only thetotal being given,.53o    This decision has been reached with reluctance-.     We feelthat we have been committed without proper consul, tat j on to a courseof doubtful wisdom.     Not only are nearly all the Dieptfc jji-ibonersCanadians? but the task of applying reprisals to German prisonersfalls mainly on Canada,     We fear a futile ceo:.test may fellow in anattempt to match with the Germans an eye for an eye.      In such acontest in the application of harshness to prisoners the germans are certain to win.3o    We consider that it would have been preferable to leave tothe Germans a face-saving escape before reprisals were applied oilour sldes     An   offer might have been made of complete investigation by the protecting power accompanied by a threat of reprisals if suchan investigation showed the German charges to be unfounded and ifthe Commonwealth prisoners, were not promptly freed from their chains?4,    To avoid, however, an open difference with the United KingdomGovernment? who had already announced the measures to be takenalthough their execution required Canadian co-operation, we havedecided with regret to take the action requested and are soinforming the presse5.    We understand that there was included in the operation plans for Dieppe a sentence authorising the tying of prisoners hands toprevent destruction of documents.     We believe that especially sincethe Germans have this order, a straightforward statement of the factsshould now assist in ending this unhappy contest in reprisalb0So    Can you offer any explanation- of why German reprisals havebeen imposed at this particular time?     What connection exists betweenthem        the incidents occurring during the Commando raid on Sark?

dtu.pt o? PHOPOfiUD public        ;;,ij-jmt .In order that the true facts of the controversy abouttying the hands of prisoners of war may be &quot;clearly before thepublic, the following statement is issued by His majesty&apos;s government.1.1 the Dieppe raid, an order was issued, withoutauthority,  to the effect that &quot;&apos;./herever possible the handsof prisoners of war will be bound, so that they cannot .destroy their papers&quot;0     On the complaint of the GermanGovernment the War Office at once, before there had been timeto make enquiry, issud a statement that, if any such order had been issued,,  it would be countermanded, because they considered chat such an order might be held to imply that,irrespective of the circumstances, the hands of prisonersof v/ar should be bound.On enquiries being made, no evidence was found thatany of the prisoners brought back from Dieppe had had their hands tied.      But the existence of the order came to light,and it was countermanded.The raid on Sark was carried out by a party of tenofficers and men.      ?jcven of the party captured five Germans.The hands of the Germans were tied in order that arms mightbe linked with the captors.     No orders, written or otherwise,had been issued.      But the prisoners had to be talc n past aGerman-occupied barracks on the way to the boats, and pre-cautions were therefore necessary.      In spite of the pre-cautionS;  four of the five Gorman prisoners of war broke away,shouting, and had to be shot to prevent them- raising the alarm.The Geneva Convention contains no statement aboutthe hands of prisoners, but prescribes humane treatment,question at issue is, therefore, what constitutes humanetreatment*Clearly &quot;this differs according to circumstances.    Thereis a wide difference between what is appropriate to a prisonerin safe custody and to prisoners in the course of battle.It will be observed that the actions complained of by theGerman Government relate to action in the course of battle.The German Government have, however, themselvestaken action to tie the hands of prisoners of war in theircustody and far removed from the battle field as an act ofreprisal,      Act:: of reprisal against prisoners of war arespecifically forbidden by the Geneva Convention,,tyingThe
