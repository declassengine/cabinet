Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Suggestions fpr a Revision of notes ON RELATIONS WITH&quot; COLOUJ^(Not to be published)1.      Among the American troops in this country are a number of units whose personnel are coloured troops.      Their Officers arewhite though there are some coloured Officers.      It is to beborne in mind that they contribute a valuable effort to the prosecution of the war by the prevision of labour both skilled and unskilled.Their presence in England presents a new problem toBritish men and women brought in contact with them.      They ar^American citizens and have equal rights with the white citizensand there is no legal discrimination between the two but theracial problem is there and cannot be ignored.It is necessary,  therefore, for the British, both men andwomen,  to recognise the problem and to take account of theattitude of the white American citizen.      This will prevent anytarnishing of our amicable relations with the U.S, Army throughmisunderstanding which knowledge and fore-thought can prevent.2.      British soldiers and auxiliaries should try to understand the reasons for the American attitude to the relationships of white and coloured people, and to appreciate why it is different from the attitude of most people in this country to the isolatedcoloured people with whom they normally come in contact.They should recognise that difficult problems do arise when people of different races live together - especially when their numbers do not differ greatly, and they are learning to live on terms of equal citizenship.      Thus they should also be aware of the differences of attitude among Americans themselves,according to whether they come from the Sou them States of theUnion, where the coloured population is about one-fourth of thetotal, or from the North where coloured people are a very small minority.3.      The historical aspect must be understood in broad outline.The U.S.   comprises a vast area and the South is semi-tropical where labour is more fitted to the coloured man.Therefore, Africans were&apos; brought over in the eighteenth centuryas slaves.      They took root and multiplied, working mostly on cotton plantations.    In the American Civil War of 1861-64 oneof the issues was the abolition of the slavery which was effected.      The negro became a free man -and though the bulk ofthem remained in the South they began to percolate into theNorth.      The coloured population of the United States is now about 12 millions,  of whom 9 millions live in the SouthernStates and 3 millions in the&apos; North.4.      In the South coloured people live apart from the white men,leading their own lives in&apos; their - own way.      They &quot;have their ownchurches,  schools and social gatherings.      They have their ownareas in towns and villages to live in.      In cars and busesthey have seats allocated and their own reservations in cinemas.

Tho white population of the South, still tend to regardcoloured people as children for whom they have a moralresponsibility.      Like children coloured people commonly inspireaffection and admiration;    but they are not considered &quot;equal1to white men and women any more than children are consideredequal to adults, although an increasing number of them are nowplaying an active and influential part in the public life ofcommunities in which they live.It is a matter of deep conviction in the South that thewhite man or woman should not intimately associate with thecoloured man.5.       In the North,  the coloured man does not work in massedlabour in the fields but more individually and his personalcontact brings him a greater political consciousness.      Hetends to demand more eq\ial treatment and becomes more sensitiveto racial distinction.      His treatment in the North is freerand he is given greater latitude and is not segregated to the degree he is in the South.      Nevertheless, his social life isnot intimately connected with that of the white man who doesnot normally associate with him in social gatherings.6.      The Americans .are making a great experiment in working out a democratic way of life in a mixed community, with races of very different characteristics and traditions.      In doing so they have to take, account .of the legacy of the past and fears of the future.      It is a difficult task and it is not for us to embarrass them,  even if we have different views 021 how racerelationships should be treated in our own country and in theEmpire.7.      There is no reason why British soldiers and auxiliariesshould adopt the Amerie; n attitude but they should respect itand avoid making it a subject for argument and dispute.      Theymust endeavour to understand the American point of view and theymust always be on their guard against giving offence.-8.      There are certain practical points which arise from theforegoing.      These include the following:-(a) Be &quot;friendly and sympathetic towards coloured american troops - but avoid intimate relationships.(b) If you find yourselves in the company of white and coloured American troops  (as for example if whiteAmerican troops come into a canteen or bar where you are in the company of coloured Americans) makeit your business to avoid unpleasantness.      It ismuch the best, however,  to avoid such situations.(c) It is undesirable that a white woman should go aboutalone in the company of a coloured American.      Thisis bound to lead to controversy and ill-feeling.This&apos; does not mean that friendly hospitality in thehome or in social gatherings need be ruled out.(d) Avoid arguments over the colour question but if ithappens to come up in discussions with&apos;&quot; iutierieantroops listen patiently to what the Americans haveto say and, without necessarily agreeing with them,try and prevent it from becoming an occasion forill-feeling or open- dispute.      You can always admit that if you happened to live in Alabama you wouldprobably think the way they do.      Every man is entitled, to his opinion.

(e) Be on your guard against ill-disposed people who are out to use the colour question as a means of stirring up trouble &quot;between the americans and ourselves.(f) It is probable that enemy propaganda willmake every effort to use the colour question to stir up bad feeling between people inthis country and the coloured troops and between American white and coloured troops.Never pass on a story which would tend tocreate disaffection and do all you can toscotch such rumours when they come to yournotice.If you have any difficulties on this problem ask yourOfficer for advice.
