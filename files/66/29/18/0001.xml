The reply of the Soviet Government to this offer was communicatedsimultaneously by the Ambassadors of the U.S.S.R. in Washington and in london on the 7th July.4. This reply accepted the proposed Second Protocol with satisfaction, butinter alia expressed the following hopes : (a) That the monthly delivery of aircraft from the United Kingdom inthe first half of 1943 would, if not increased, at any rate not bereduced, and that the supply of aircraft from the United states would, after October 1942, be increased to the greatest possible limit.(b) That the monthly delivery of aluminium on United Kingdom account should be continued after September 1942 until the end of the protocol period; and that 10 tons of cobalt per month should be delivered.(c) That the Combined Offer of nickel made at the rate of 600 short tons per month for the first six months (subject to review) including the nickelcontent of manufactured goods, but not finished munitions, should be revised so as to secure delivery at the rate of 400 tons per month,exclusive of the amounts required for the manufacture of finished products.5.

6. The United States Government proposed a draft Article saying thatthey and we were &quot; making every effort to comply with the hopes of the SovietGovernment with respect to &quot; these matters. I did not feel able to accept this,since it held out promises, especially in respect of aircraft, wdiich we could not hope to fulfil. We have now secured their acceptance of a form of words which,so far as the United Kingdom is concerned., merelv sets out the decisions so far-----. i ^ &quot;       - *&quot;reached in regard to these requests.7. After consulting the Minister of Production. I have authorised lord halifax to proceed to the signature of an Agreement in the form attached to this paper (Appendix).8. I am glad, to be able to report the successful conclusion of these negotiations, with the details of which I need not trouble my colleagues, except to say that we had some difficulty, in persuading the United States Governmentto accept the text of what is now Annex III and that Mr. Winant&apos;s helpful inter-vention has been of the greatest assistance in bringing them round to our view.(Initialled) A.

The Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom have been giving the most serious consideration to the munitions of war which we can make available to the Soviet Government during the coming year. In additionto possible limitations due to the shortage of ships, the controlling factor by theNorthern Route is the quantity of shipping that can be escorted to ports of discharge. The limiting factor by the Southern Route is inland transportationfrom Persian Gulf ports.2. Our respective Governments will make available for despatch from the ports of the United States, United Kingdom and other countries during theperiod the 1st July, 1942, to the 30th June, 1943, approximately 3,300,000 shorttons to the Northern ports and 1,100,000 short tons to the Persian Gulf ports. Inthe circumstances mentioned in paragraph 1, it is our opinion that this is thehighest practicable export programme from all sources at which we can now aim.Within the limits imposed from time to time by the factors mentioned, we willsupply the shipping necessary to lift that part of this programme for whichU.S.S.R. ships cannot be made available.3.   The schedule of stores which the United States can make available hasbeen drawn up in the light of the programme of requirements as submitted to theUnited States Government by the U.S.S.R.  The schedule of stor.es offered by the[24425] - ,   - b
United Kingdom has been drawn up on the assumption that Russia desires tocontinue to receive supplies on the scale agreed at the Moscow Conference. the stores listed in these schedules amount to approximately 8,000,000 short tons.4. It will be necessary for the Soviet Government to select from theseschedules a programme of particular supplies and munitions of war for procure-ment and despatch which will come within the amounts mentioned in paragraph 2.This programme should include all cargoes to be transported after the 1st July,1942, including Protocol and non-Protocol items either already on order or tobe ordered.5. It is to be understood this programme is subject to variations to meetunforeseen developments in the progress of the war. But you may be sure that every effort will be made to deliver the particular supplies which you designate.6. The United States will be pleased to extend financial arrangements tocover its part of the proposed new Protocol and all adjustments thereof. TheUnited Kingdom financial arrangements will continue as at present, i.e., cash-credit agreement of the 16th August, 1941, to cover civil supplies, and lend-lease agreement now under negotiation to cover warlike supplies, the terms ofwhich have been agreed in principle.7. We, of course, stand ready through appropriate officials to discuss with your representatives in Washington all detailed questions pertaining to theschedules listed below and any reasonable adjustments that may be desired.8. Above all we want to assure you that we have a full understanding ofthe vital importance of your Front and the urgent necessities of moving supplies to it in. the highest possible volume and in the shortest space of time.9. With this in mind, we shall be glad to review the programme from timeto time to see if increased quantities of munitions can be provided and delivered.Schedule of  United States Stores.The United States Government undertakes to make available to the Unionof Soviet Socialist Republics the following schedule of stores aggregating some7,000,000 short tons valued at three billion dollars, of which there are 1,110,000tons of Military and Naval equipment, armament and ammunition valued at two billion dollars, 1,800,000 tons of materials, machinery and industrial equipment worth four hundred million dollars and 4,300,000 tons of food productsworth six hundred million dollars.The following schedule has been prepared on the basis that any balanceswhich may be due from the existing Protocol after the 30th June, 1942, will be absorbed, as well as all articles contained in the new Protocol for whichrequisitions have been previously approved with delivery scheduled after the30th June, 1942.In the following schedule, the item numbers and major classifications corres-pond to those in the U.S.S.R.

It trusts, however, that the UnitedStates of America will find it possible to satisfy these Soviet requirements inthe future.The Soviet Government expresses its satisfaction at the statement of theAmerican and British Governments that they would be glad from time to timeto revise this programme with a view to examining the possibilities of-increasingthe quantities of military supplies which can be put at the disposal of andtransported to the U.S.S.R .The Soviet Government empowers the Soviet Purchasing Commission in washington to finally work out those points of the Protocol which require futher clarification and agreement.
