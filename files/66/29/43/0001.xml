(42) 463.October 13, 1942.WAR CABINET.PROPOSED SCHEME FOR RECEPTION IN SWITZERLAND OFCHILDREN FROM OCCUPIED EUROPE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 2nd June the War Cabinet postponed further consideration of aproposal that limited quantities of milk for children should be allowed to enterenemy-occupied Allied territories; and the Prime Minister subsequently informed the Belgian Ambassador of the reasons why we could not at present agree to sucha proposal as regards Belgium.2. I think my colleagues will be interested to know that the Minister ofEconomic Warfare and I have considered whether some means could not befound of offering alleviation of the lot of children in Belgium and other Alliedoccupied territories, without impairing the principle that Germany is solely responsible for feeding the countries she has overrun. We reached the conclusionthat the best way of doing this would be to encourage the Swiss Government todevelop arrangements they have already made for receiving Allied children inSwitzerland for recuperative visits. Our encouragement would take the form of offering to grant navieerts, over and above Switzerland5s normal rations, forcertain goods which Switzerland might need to import to feed and look after a fairly considerable number of Allied children. This plan is now under considera-tion with the United States Government, who appear to be strongly in favour ofit. and who have already broached it to the Swiss Government.3. While the Germans are quite likely to sabotage the scheme, partly atleast on the ground that they cannot afford to make the necessary arrangements to transport the children to Switzerland, it represents in present circumstances amost desirable gesture on our part towards helping these children in some way,without impairing the blockade or aiding the enemy. As such, and, particularlyin view of Field-Marshal Goring&apos;s recent threat that the occupied countries muststarve to feed Germany, this scheme is. I think, well worth proceeding with.A.
