Printed for the War Cabinet, October, 1942MOST SECRET c%Copy No.   0W.P.

As my colleagues are aware, the United States authorities are sending to this country the same proportion of coloured troops as obtains generallythroughout the United States Army. There are now between 11,000 and 12,000such troops over here, and their numbers are likely to be considerably increased.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the 119th (42) Meeting of the WarCabinet on 31st August, 1942, undertook, with the approval of the War Cabinetto press the U.S.A. authorities to reduce the numbers sent over, but I believehas met with little success. We are thus left to face the various problems towhich their presence gives rise.2. The policy of the United States military authorities in dealing with theircoloured troops in this country is based on the modus vivendi which has been developed in the United States in the course of time as the result of the conditionsobtaining in that country, lheir policy, which is well understood amongAmericans (although there is a minority in the United States which advocatesa departure from the traditional view) rests on the principle of an almost complete separation between white and coloured troops. Thus the latter are placed in separate formations: they live in separate camps and are provided with their own canteens, clubs, recreation rooms and entertainments. Separatehostels are being provided and it is the intention to send over to this countrycoloured A.T.S. units to do the work normally done by A.T.S. for white troops.3. This policy which may perhaps be fairly described as the combination of equal rights and segregation practised in the Southern States is not generally known to the population of this country who with little experience of a colourproblem at home are naturally inclined to make no distinction between thetreatment of white and coloured troops and are apt to regard such distinctionsas undemocratic.4. The War Office is thus faced with two incompatible theories, the disregard of either of which may have serious consequences. On the one hand the averagewhite American soldier does not understand the normal British attitude to the colour problem and his respect for this country may suffer if he sees BritishTroops and British Women&apos;s Services drawing no distinction between whiteand coloured. There have already been instances of American white troopswalking out of canteens and public houses on seeing coloured American soldiersbeing served in such places. This difference of attitude may clearly give riseto friction and, in fact, has done so. Moreover, the coloured troops themselvesprobably expect to be treated in this country as in the United States, and a
markedly different treatment might well sause political difficulties in Americaat the end of the war. It must be added that from the point of view of the morale of our own troops, whether in this country or overseas, it is most undesirable that there should be any unnecessary association between Americancoloured troops and British women. These considerations suggest that theWar Office attitude towards the American coloured troops should be basedon the view of the American Army authorities.5. On the other hand, there is evidence both in the public Press and from members of Parliament that any difference of treaunent between white and coloured troops may be regarded as racial discrimination which will give riseto bitter resentment. I have, for example received a letter from Mr. Pritt onthis subject and in the Sunday Pictorial of 6th September, there was an attackon the wife of the vicar of YVorie, Weston-super-Mare, for having advised thewomen of that village as to their attitude towards coloured troops. This pointof view has a considerable measure of official support. Thus the Secretary ofState for the Colonies has told me that he is unhappy about the possible repercussions of the policy of the American Army authorities on West indian opinion and that of our Colonial Empire generally; an article written several months ago by the Minister of Information and concerned only with the positionof coloured British subjects in this country was published in the Sunday Expresson the 20th September, and given the heading of &quot; The Colour Bar Must Go &quot; :appearing at this time, it may have been read by some as referring also to thequestion of American Coloured Troops; and the Home Office in a circularsent out to Chief Constables regarding the attitude of the police towardsAmerican coloured troops emphasizes that &quot;it is not the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that any discrimination as regards the treatment of coloured troops should be made by the British authorities&quot;.6. The War Office finds itself on a razors edge and its attitude has been to endeavour to maintain a nice balance between these two conflicting views.Relying for the avoidance of many difficulties on the administrative arrange-ments which the Americans themselves make for the segregation of the coloured troops from the white troops, it has taken no steps to discriminate against theformer in those cases where the American administrative arrangements do not cover the case. For example,&apos; in railway canteens run by British authorities,no endeavour is made to exclude the coloured American soldier. At the sametime, while admitting no official discrimination in the British Army arrangementsfor coloured troops, the War Office has held that it is desirable for Britishtroops, especially British A.T.S., to understand the American background onthis matter and so to regulate their conduct as not to give cause for offenceeither to the white or to the coloured troops. From the point of view of therelations between the two Armies, this is most important. Misunderstandings,or quarrels on this subject may well have serious results and may even affectthe efficiency of the Allied fighting machine. It is, therefore, in my viewessential that within the limits that are necessarily imposed on us and subjectto local conditions we should follow the general lead given by the U.S.A.authorities.7. It is natural that in so delicate and controversial a matter the militaryauthorities should have asked for guidance. The War Office view from the start has been that no written instructions should be issued. Never-theless, early in August the Major-General in charge of Administration, SouthernCommand, in whose area a large proportion of the American troops in this ycountry will eventually be stationed decided that in view of the difficultieswhich were already occurring it was essential to give some confidential guidance in writing to his District Commanders and the local Regional Commissioners.He accordingly issued a short paper (of which a copy is annexed) entitled &quot; notes on relations with Coloured Troops&quot; to all District Commanders and to the regional Commissioners of numbers 6 and 7 Regions. The paper was sentunder cover of a personal letter, which stated that the notes had been preparedto provide material for officers, including A.T.S., when talking with their menand women on the subject, and emphasized that the notes must not be distributed in writing except to selected officers for the above purposes. the notes were issued in close consultation with the local American Commanders,
and set out shortly the historical reasons for the American Army policy. the notes were generally welcomed as affording guidance to a uniform policy, and,whether due to their issue or not, relations between British and American troops have since improved considerably.I think that it is desirable that some purely factual statement, such as isgiven in the beginning of the note, should be made available to the Armygenerally. That view was expressed at a meeting of the Bolero CombinedCommittee (London) on 12th August, 1942, and it was recommended that anarticle should be published by the Army Bureau of Current Affairs after con-sultation with the Foreign Office setting out the history and facts of the relationsbetween the white and coloured communities in America and between whiteand coloured troops. I endorse that recommendation and I hope that an agreedarticle will appear in an early issue. But I do not propose that the article shouldbe followed by instructions or written advice based on the facts presented. Theproblem is more than an Army problem and any authorized statement which in,any degree took sides could not be limited to the Armed Forces in its application.So far as the Army is concerned, therefore, I contemplate no such&apos; statement.But it will be left to Army officers as occasions arise to interpret the facts orallyto those serving under them. There is of course always the risk, in the absence ofwritten instructions, of varying interpretations and of misrepresentation of what has been said. But the objection to written instructions is so great that the risk is the lesser evil.To sum up, I would ask the endorsement of the War Cabinet of the policy propose to follow in the Army:  (a) To make full use of the American administrative arrangements for thesegregation of coloured troops, but where those fail to make no.official discrimination against them.(b) To give the Army through A.B.C.A. a knowledge of the facts-and historyof the colour question in the U.S.A. and the U.S.A. Army.(c) To allow Army officers without the issue of overt or written instructionsto interpret those facts to the personnel of the Army including theA.T.S. and so educate them to adopt towards the U.S.A. coloured troops the attitude of the U.S.A.

NOTES ON RELATIONS with  COLOURED TROOPS(Not to be published)i. Among the American troops in this country are a number of units whosepersonnel are coloured troops. Their Officers are white though there are some&apos;coloured officers. It is to be borne in mind that they contribute a valuableeffort to the prosecution of the war by the provision of labour both skilled andunskilled.Their presence in England presents a new problem to British men andwomen brought in contact with them. They are American citizens and haveequal rights with the white citizens and there is no discrimination between thetwo but the racial problem is there and cannot be ignored.It is necessary, therefore, for the British, both men and women, to realizethe problem and to adjust their attitude so that it conforms to that of the whiteAmerican citizen. This will prevent any tarnishing of our amicable relationswith the US. Army through misunderstanding which knowledge and fore-thought can prevent.2. The historical aspect must be understood in broad outline.The US. comprises a vast area and the South is semi-tropical where labour is more fitted to the coloured man. Therefore, Africans were brought over inthe eighteenth century as slaves. They took root and multiplied, workingmostly oh cotton plantations. In the American Civil War of 1861-64 one of the issues was the abolition of the slavery which was effected. The negro became a free man and though the bulk of them remained in the South they began topercolate, into the North. This historical cause accounts for a difference inattitude between citizens in the North and South of the U.S.A.3. The bulk of the coloured population remains in the S. and S.W. Statesof the Union. They live apart from the white men, leading their own lives intheir own way. They have their own churches, schools and social gatherings.They have their own areas in towns and villages to live in. In cars and busesthey have seats allocated, and their own reservations in cinemas.They are sympathetically treated by the white man and in their relationship with each other there is a bond of mutual esteem. The white man feels bismoral duty to them as it were to a child.In many ways the coloured man in the South is happier than his brotherin the North.But the racial problem demands that the white man or woman does notintimately associate with the coloured man.4. In the North, the coloured man does not work in massed labour in the fields but more individually and his personal contact brings him a greaterpolitical consciousness. He tends to demand more equable treatment andbecomes more sensitive to racial distinction. His treatment in the North is freerand he is given greater latitude and is not segregated to the degree he is in theSouth. Nevertheless, his social life is not intimately connected with that of thewhite man who does not normally associate with him in social gatherings.5. While there are many coloured men of high mentality and culturaldistinction, the generality are of a simple mental outlook. They work hardwhen they have no money and when they have money prefer to do nothinguntil it is.gone. In short they have not the white man&apos;s ability to think and actto a plan. Their spiritual outlook is well known and their songs give the clueto their nature. They respond to sympathetic treatment. They are naturalpsychologists in that they can size up a white mahs character and can takeadvantage of a weakness. Too much freedom, too wide associations with whitemen tend to make them lose their heads and have on occasions led to civil strife.This occurred after the last war due to too free treatment and associations whichthey had experienced in France.6. A summary then of the coloured man from the U.S.A. is that he is arace within a nation, living a life apart, possessing equal rights of citizenship aridsympathetically treated, yet debarred from, full social association by the fact of his birth.
(b42/127)   80   10/42   w.o.p.   117867. From these facts the correct attitude of the British soldier or auxiliarycan be gauged.It is necessary to realize:  (a) the coloured problem with which America is faced.(6) the necessity for us to conform to the American attitude.(c) the mental outlook of the coloured man.(d) the difference in attitude between North and South.8. There are certain practical points which arise from the foregoing. these include the following:  (a) Be sympathetic in your mind towards the coloured man, basing yoursympathy on a knowledge of his problem, of his good qualities andhis weaker ones.(6) White women should not associate with coloured men. It follows then,they should not walk out, dance, or drink with them. Do not thinksuch action hard or unsociable. They do not expect your com-panioriship and such relations would in the end only result in strife.(c) Soldiers should not make intimate friends with them, taking them tocinemas or bars. Your wish to be friendly if it becomes too intimatemay be an unkind act in the end.Try and find out from American troops how they treat themand avoid such action as would tend to antagonize the white Americansoldier.(d) It is to be noted that in the U.S.A. there are a few political extremistswho endeavour to make the colour question a means to stir uppolitical trouble.  If such are met with they should not be listened to.(e) It is probable that enemy propaganda will make every effort to use the colour question to stir up bad feeling between people in this countryand the coloured troops and between American white and coloured troops. Never pass on a story7 which would tend to create disaffec-tion and&apos; do all you can to scotch such rumours when they cometo your notice.If you have any difficulties on this problem ask your officer for &quot;advice.
