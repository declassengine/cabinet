(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF ijjcs BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)SECRET    &apos;gjp1T42).437--: COPY NO.23rd September. 1942.WAR cabinet ADMISSION TO THE UNITED KINGDOM OF A LIMITED NUMBER* .   OF JEWISH REFUGEES FROM UNOCCUPIED FRANCE.Memorandum by the Home Secretary;    Strong representations have been made to me that in viewof-the danger and suffering to which Jewish refugees inunoccupied France are exposed as a result of the decision of.the Vichy Government to deport numbers of them to Polandconsideration ought to be given to the possibility of admittingto&apos; this country some at any rate of the children and the olderpeople.Sir:Herbert Emerson, who is the Chairman of the AdvisoryCouncil on Aliens,  came to see me in his capacity as theLeague of Nations High Commissioner for Refugees&apos;and asked that the question of admitting say, a 1,000 children should beconsidered.    His information is that the Vichy Government willnot, as a general rule, grant exit permits to persons over the: age of 15 or under the age of 60 but that they might be willingto grant such permits for the children and older people.The Chairman of the Jewish Committee for Refugees(Mr.. Otto Schiff) has also told me that harrowing stories ofthe. ill-treatment of the Jews in unoccupied France have arousedthe strongest feelings amongst the Jewish community and amongst other people in this country, and has urged that public opinionhere would be in favour of the admission of children and elderlypeople who have near relatives in this country.    He recognises that it is not possible for us to admit large numbers of theseunfortunate people and that if any were admitted it would benecessary to draw a strict line of demarcation for the purposesof limiting the number.    He has suggested as a possible line of demarcation that admission should be granted to children and to persons over 60 who have close relatives in the United Kingdom,and that the limitation to those who have &quot;close relatives&quot;should be defined as meaning children who have a parent,brother,  sister or grandparent in this country and personsover 60rwho have a child, grandchild, brother or sister in thiscountry.    Exact figures as to the number of cases which wouldbe included in these categories cannot be obtained, but theJewish Refugee Committee calculate that the total number ofsuch children and such persons over 60 would not exceed 300or&apos; ,350.  .If this scheme were accepted, the Jewish RefugeeCommittee would make itself responsible for ascertaining thefacts about each application, and the Home Office on being satisfied that the application falls within the category would authorise our representative in Lisbon to grant a visa.   ThePortuguese authorities would, it is believed, then grant atransit visa and arrangements would be made for the children and elderly persons in respect of whom such transit visas v/eregranted to travel from unoccupied France through Spain toLisbon.The Jewish Refugee Committee havo* guaranteed that there
would do no question of any such children or persons over 60-:becoming.; a charge on public funds,    Most of them would -he &apos; -maintained &quot;by the relatives who apply for their admission,  andas regards- any exceptional cases the Jewish Refugee Committeewould raise any necessary funds from voluntary sources.&apos;&quot;, &apos;-*-..   There are many foreign persons, both Jews and others,  in portugal,  in other parts of 3uropo and in-North Africa, who are anxious to ,come to this country,   and the general policy has been not to admit, during the war additional refugees to theUnited Kingdom unless in some quite rare and exceptional&apos; cases it can &quot;be shown that the admission of the refugee will he;directly advantageous to &quot;our War effort.   Any departure fromthis rigid policy is -liable to-lead-to fresh claims and additional pressure for the admission to the United Kingdom ofpersons who are in danger or- distress, ahd I am convincedthat it would not he right to make any general departure fromthe principle that- the United Kingdom is unable, during theperiod of the war at any rate, to accept additional-refugees.Apart froni other;considerations there is the, risk thatany relaxations of * United Kingdom policy v/ill facilitate the deportation policy of the Vichy Government.    The &quot;vichy government might.find it easier to deport Jewish parents if itwere * recognised that the United Kingdom would - allow qhildren:when.are stranded&apos;as a result o&apos;f;this policy to be dumped here,.  .    -ivloreover, we already -have a very large body of refugeeshere and not all sections of public opinion are enthusiasticabout their presence;&apos;   pressure on accommodation,  especially as more and n;ore United States troops arrive, steadily increases;and if we&apos; get beyond&apos; a point in the admission of&apos; foreignrefugees we may -stir -up an unpleasant . degree of anticsemitism(of which there &quot;is a fair amount just below the surface) andthat would be bad for the country and the Jewish community*Discretion is therefore necessary.On the other hand representations made by refugees in thiscountry who have children and close relatives in unoccupied france v/ill make a very strong appeal to the humanitarianfeelings of large numbers of our people,  including no doubtmany M.P&apos;s,  and in some individual cases; at any rate it may be extremely difficult for the Government&apos;to maintain what wouldappear to be a hard -^hearted rigidity. -&quot;Cfri- the whole therefore I am inclined to think that thebalance of advantage would lie in acceding to the request ofthe Jewish Refugee Cofamittee that&apos;sympathetic consideration should be :given to the special cases, which will eertainly becoiup&amp;raLively few in number,  of children and persons over 60who have close relatives here,,    No doubt there will be pressurego enlarge the limited category suggested, and it is possiblethat representations may be made by some of the AlliedGovernments that if this&apos; concession is made to Jewish refugees  fin unoccupied Prance similar concessions ought to be made tosome of their nationals, who. are in danger or distress.Nevertheless I think a - distinction can be drawn between theposition of these&quot; children and elderly persons in unoccupiedPrance v/ho are exposed to special suffering and danger as aresult of the redent Vichy.policy and the position of otherrefugees, and that the limited concession proposed could bejustified on the ground that while it is not practicable to admit all the refugees who have relatives here the Government
are reluctant on this account to refuse admission to any&apos;^.and that if any are admitted priority can properly be^givento those who have near relatives in this country.    Thoserelatives are, generally speaking, persons who are helping usin the war effort and to reunite them with their families isdesirable not only on humanitarian grounds hut on the groundthat such a procedure would help to improve their morale.If this policy is approved, I would propose to refuse all further concessions.    For instance a special appeal has beenmade to me to admit 28 children who are in a Jewish Home inunoccupied France and have guarantees for admission to palestine as soon as transport is available.    I have beenasked to allow them to come to this country until such time as they can be sent to Palestine.    If, however, I were toagree to this course representations will no doubt be made that there are many other persons in unoccupied France whoeither already have certificates for admission to Palestine(or elsewhere) or can count on such certificates at an earlydate, and it would become impracticable to draw a line of demarcation.    I shall also, no doubt, have appeals as regardsvarious adults in unoccupied France who a&apos;re under the age of60 and have relatives in this country,&apos; but it will benecessary to resist all such appeals.H.M.HOME OFFICE.23rd September. 1942.
