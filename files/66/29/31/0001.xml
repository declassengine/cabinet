(   O   OnTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1942.SECRET Copy No.W.P. (42) 451.October 8, 1942.WAR CABINET.RELATIONS WITH CANADA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I should like to bring to the notice of my colleagues an aspect of our relationswith Canada which impressed itself forcibly upon me during my recent visit toOttawa. While Mr. Mackenzie King and his colleagues gave me a most friendlywelcome, and my personal relations with them could not be more cordial, I couldnot fail to detect in Ministerial and official circles an undercurrent of uneasiness,indeed resentment, at what is regarded there as a lack of recognition of the partthat Canada is playing in the war. The Canadian Government are proud ofCanada&apos;s war effort, as they have every reason to be : in munitions production,in the supply of essential raw materials and foodstuffs, in the management of theair training scheme, in the provision and equipment of naval, military and airforces, in shipbuilding and ship repairs, and, finally, in the billion dollar gift in all these directions Canada has strained every nerve to contribute to her utmost,and her total contribution has been immense. Moreover, she has financed thewhole of her war effort from her own resources, and to do so has transformed hersocial economy and imposed on her people taxation of certainly the same order ofseverity as that in force in this country. The Canadian Government do not wantpraise for what they have done, though it is certainly fitting that we shouldacknowledge not so much in words as in our general attitude towards canada the great part which she is playing. What is disturbing Canadian ministers and causing a damping effect in Ottawra is a growing realisation that, now thatthe British Commonwealth no longer stands alone in the struggle, it is theGreat Powers associated with us whto come uppermost in our minds with theresult that in the stress and strain of events we are apt, in effect, to deny to canada that full and equal partnership with us to which by her contribution shefeels herself entitled. The Canadian Government feel, in short, that they arebeing gradually elbowed aside in the cause of Anglo-American and Anglo-Sovietco-operation.I am sure my colleagues will agree with me that it is most important thatwe should do all we can to allay any apprehensions of this character. Ifuneasiness on this score were to spread from Canadian official circles to theCanadian public, the results would certainly be serious and far-reaching. Weshall need the utmost assistance which Canada can give us not only in materials and man-power, but also financially; given a sense of full partnership with us,we can count on the Canadians as on our own people, and they will, I am sure,be ready to face any and every sacrifice in the common cause. But once let themfeel that they are regarded here as playing only a minor role, the sharp edge oftheir enthusiasm will be blunted and their willingness to give of their utmostimpaired by a barrier of mistrust.Fortunately, there is time to check this dangerous undercurrent before it becomes strong; all that is needed is that each of us in our respective spheresshould keep our relations with Canada prominently in mind and should seek byprior consultation to associate the Canadian Government with us in all decisions affecting Canadian interests. Only thus can we give full effect to the conception of equal partnership, and I am sure that I can count on my colleagues to co-operate with me in working to this end.C. R. A.Dominions Office, October 8, 1942.[24459]
