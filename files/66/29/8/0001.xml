S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT) *SECRET.-W.P.(42)428.-25RD SEPTEMBER,  1942*- COPY NO.WAR CABINETINDIAN STATES;    REQUEST BY CHAMBER OP PRINCESFOR STATEMENT OP POLICY BY HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Economic WarfareGreat Britain&apos;s reputation as a loyal observer of treatiesis&quot;our trump card in international affairs and its importancetranscends even that of the Indian problem.Not only the Princes, but also many other people in Indiaand elsewhere are in genuine doubt whether we intend to implementour treaty obligations to the Rulers of the Indian States.      TheLord Privy Seal&apos;s statement in the House of Commons complained ofwould appear to be open to the misinterpretation which has beenplaced on it in some quarters, that we intend to being pressure texpedite the constitutional development of the States..In these circumstances it seems desirable that the Viceroy1sreply to the Chancellor of the Chamber of Princes should containno qualification   of our treaty obligations and that it should bemade public.     The nettle has to be grasped sometime.      It is better that there should be no misunderstanding of the factthat Britain intends to honour all her obligations to theIndian States,  and that therefore,  their participation in anyIndian Union will have to be a genuinely voluntary one and not as a result of our coercion - direct or indirect.S.Ministry of Economic Warfare, W.l.
