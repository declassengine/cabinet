It is the centre of the mining district, and its population of 32,000largely consists of miners and those serving their needs.On the night of 1st/2nd September 232 aircraft were directed to attackSaarbriicken. The first of the 19 Pathfinders marked Saarlautern in error, withthe result that the whole force concentrated there.Very extensive damage has been done by fire and H.E., to both industrial and residential property in the section of the town lying on the North bank of theriver. The rest of the town on the South bank of the river has not yet been photo-graphed by day, but the indications are that the area of destruction is probablygreater.Karlsruhe (2nd/3rd September).4. This city is the administrative capital of Baden (population 190,000).It has a large inland port on its West side and important railway repair shopson its East side. The armament factory of &quot; Deutsche Waffen &quot; is its mostimportant industrial concern.5. A force of 200 aircraft attacked the city and port, achieving, with the guidance of the Pathfinders, an extremely dense concentration. Print No. 1shows fires and smoke drifting over the city during the attack. Day photo-graphs reveal 270 acres of destruction in the city and industrial districts,excluding damage in the docks. Print No. 2 shows blocks of municipal buildingsgutted in the centre of the city, and Prints Nos. 3 and 4 some of the destructionin other districts.6. In the industrial area one large building and at least five small buildings at the Michelin tyre works are gutted. Three-quarters of another large factoryis gutted or destroyed by blast (Print No. 5); a 4,00.0-lb. bomb appears to haveburst directly in its largest building. In the dock area a large warehouse417 yards x 84 yards was still burning nine days after the attack (Print No. 6).Other warehouses and a power station at the Eastern end of the docks, coveringan area of approximately 15 acres, have been completely destroyed.7. A ground report states that there were as many as two hundred firesburning at once. The goods station was still on fire late on the following after-noon, and warehouses in the vicinity are said to be severely damaged. The FoodOffice, Regional Treasury, Police Headquarters and main Post Office were severely damaged. During the evening of the 3rd September railway traffic was stopped at the outskirts of the town.Another report states that on the 4th and 5th September coal traffic throughKarlshuhe had fallen by 30 per cent.
u jBremen (4th/5th September).8. A force of 215 aircraft carried out the most successful of the manyraids on Bremen, and photographs suggest almost as much damage was done asin all previous raids put together. Fires were burning next morning in factories and warehouses in the dock area, and in many residential properties. print. 7 shows several blocks in the core of the city burning fiercely.9. In the docks, the Weser Flugzeugbau aircraft factory, which makes the Ju. 87, has been seriously damaged, the machine shop almost destroyed andother buildings blasted. Two workshops of the Atlas shipyards which makeU-boat hulls, warehouses on the Europa and Ffohentors Hafen and on the quayside near the Weser railway station, railway sheds at Neubau station and 220yards of covered goods sidings at the goods station have been destroyed.10. In the inner town devastation among residential and business property is considerable, and it is possible that nearly l/5th of the inner town is now inruins.11. The Focke Wulf factory was the target for a small part of the force.Photographs secured so far are not satisfactory, but they reveal a direct hiton a hangar-type building adjacent to the boiler house.Duisburg (6th/7th September).12. This attack was carried out by 207 aircraft. Only a small part of thetown has been covered by photographs, but the following, mostly south of theCentral city area, can be seen :(i) On the South-East side of the Aussen Hafen a large building, probablypart of an engineering works, is gutted, and on the North-West sideof the Hafen two bays of a five-bay building are seriously damaged,(ii) In both the Deutsche Maschinenfabrik A.G. and the VereinigteStahlwerke two buildings have been damaged by high explosive. Achemical works and two other buildings in Nicolai Strasse aredamaged.13. Photographs, taken on the 10th September, show a large factory inNeuendorf almost entirely burnt out, and much damage to residential property.14.   The whole story of this attack cannot be told as yet.15. A ground report states that during the attack on Duisburg on the21st/22nd July, the large French tug Nantes was sunk.Russelsheim (8th/9th September).16. This industrial town (15,000 inhabitants) was attacked by 249 aircraft.The target was Frankfurt, 10 miles to the North-East, but the Pathfinders markedRusselsheim, which is also on the Main, and in moonless conditions may well have resembled Frankfurt.17. The bulk of the attack fell on the Adam Opel factory, which wasadapted for the production of components for A.F.Vs. and aircraft, and isknown to employ 17,600 workers (many of these are, of course, drawn from the surrounding districts).18. Photographs so far secured shew&apos; 10 workshops either gutted or seriously damaged, eight acres of workshops adjoining the railway completelygutted, smaller buildings, a timber stack and stores of material destroyed. Someof this damage is shown in Print No. 8.dusseldorf (10th/11th September).19. Dusseldorf was very successfully attacked by 475 aircraft, including174 drawn from training units. The Southern and larger half of the townappears as completely devastated as the most heavily hit areas in Cologne. Thetown was still burning the next day but final assessments are not yet available.Two prints, however, are attached No. 9 showing the ruins of the DeutscheRohrenwerke, which made steel tubes, and No. 10 showing destruction at themain railway station and burnt-out docks nearby.[24422] b 2/
Information regarding Previous Raids. ^Kassel (27th/28th August).20.   A detailed assessment of the damage caused by the attack shows-(i) Hits on the Hensehel locomotive works one of the most important inthe Reich.(ii) In the Sternberg Strasse six factories completely gutted.(iii) In the Frankfurt Strasse a large factory gutted.(iv) In the Wolfhanger Strasse a further factory damaged.Residential property suft&apos;er*ed considerably, a typical incident being shown on Print 11.Nuremberg (28th/29th August).21. Nuremberg is the largest industrial town in Northern Bavaria(population over 400,000). It is also an important centre of communications,where two main transport routes of major importance intersect. Industriesconsist mainly of engineering works, many solely engaged on the production of tanks, diesel engines, armoured cars and other military transport.22. There are six main areas of damage. High explosive caused damageover 3^ acres and If acres of built-up area respectively. In the North and north-East part of the town there is much damage to industrial property. Atthe MAN. submarine diesel-engine works a shed 360&apos; x 70&apos; has been completely destroyed, another building 250&apos; x 70&apos; partially demolished, and other shedsdamaged by fire. In the Siemens Schuckert Works a building 275&apos; long hasbeen completely destroyed. At the aerodrome a large hangar and. two workshopshave been damaged. There are also a number of items of damage to domesticproperty. One 4,000-lb. bomb demolished houses and sheds over an area ofapproximately 8,000 square yards in the North-East part of the town. Thereis a very heavily damaged area immediately South of the main railway station.The station building has been gutted, and there are a few incidents in the oldtown.23. The German Press announced that the Mayor of Nuremberg had calleda conference of all managers of firms connected with the building industry. there opening of schools has been postponed.24. Two photographs are attached showing damage to the Johann MedererMetal Works and an adjoining factory (Print No. 12) and fire and blast damage to semi-industrial property (Print No. 13).Hamburg.25. Further damage from the July raids, now revealed, is centred cheifly working-class districts of Barmbeck, and suburban districts of Wandsbeckand Horn. In Barmbeck a considerable number of blocks of flats, tenements and houses have been destroyed or damaged by high explosives or fire in additionto some warehouse property. In Wandsbeck factory buildings have been damaged:(including a chemical works) and five blocks of barrack buildings destroyed or seriously damaged. In Horn further barrack buildings have been damaged&quot; and a&quot;row of army huts gutted.-  Mainz.26.   Further reports, believed to be reliable, state:(i) 400 people were killed and many more injured.   Of 40,000 evacuated,30,000 (nearly one third of the population) were homeless.(ii) Seven days after the attack on the 12th/13th August the main station was still closed to all but military traffic. For three days after the raid, a tremendous now of refugees continued to arrive at Frankfurtstation.(iii) Two oil transport trains were burnt out, and 24 barges laden with coalsunk.saarbrucken.27. It is reported that in the attack on the 29th/30th July 68 passengercoaches, and a considerable number of goods trucks in or adjoining the goods station, were destroyed or damaged.
28. A newspaper report of the 19th August stated.that in-order to repairthe worst of the damage in Saarbrucken workers from many other districts hadto be brought into the city, amongst them &quot; innumerable &quot; glaziers fromWurzburg, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and many other towns.29. German railway employees in Basle are reported to have informed theirSwiss colleagues that the railway lines and sidings in Saarbrucken have been soeffectively damaged in R.A.F. attacks that full resumption of traffic would notbe possible for a considerable period. &apos; &apos;Dtdsburg.30. A reliable report states that the inland harbour installations were badly damaged, at least thirty barges being sunk, and as a result the traffic in german coal and Swedish pulp to the southward has dropped off considerably.Stuttgart.31. Further confirmation of damage to the Bosch Works has been receivedfrom a reliable informant, who states that 600 workers were unemployed for two weeks after the attack in the first week of May. Two textile works and aleather factory were severely damaged and had not recommenced production bythe middle of July. It took a week to effect full repairs to railway lines in and around the town.Rostock.32. A reliable source states that as a result of the four attacks on Rostockbetween the 23rd and 26th April: (i) About one-third of the Heinkel works were destroyed or sufferedvarying degrees of damage.(ii) Over forty-five large bombers, completed or nearly so, were destroyed or damaged beyond repair.(iii) For eighteen days after the attack there was no water, gas or electricityin the town.(iv) Over 400 people were killed in a shelter, and total casualties killed and severely wounded amounted to about 6,000.  Morale was very bad andthe police had to intervene to prevent panic spreading,(v) It was three weeks before the railway lines between Rostock andWarnemunde were fully repaired.Lille A rea.33. On the 19th and 20th July Boston aircraft attacked targets in the Lillearea by day.  Reports of damage state : (i) The installation of Desmarais Freres was very severely damaged.(ii) The Kuhlmann chemical works in Lille were damaged, the zinc chlorideand caustic soda workshops being hit. Two other factories were seton  re.(iii) At Pont-a-Vendin serious damage was caused to the synthetic ammoniaplant.(iv) At Douai the Penna-royal plant, and at Gosnaye the power station,were severely damaged.Mining.34.   The following reports of mining successes have been received : (a) On the 23rd July the Danish steamer Ruth of 321 tons was mined and sank off the entrance to the Guldborgsund, near Gjedser.(b) On the 12th August the Dtanish fishing vessel Gudrun was mined and sank 1 mile off Koldoy Kass in the Little Belt.(c) The Danish Lise of 1,247 tons was mined and sank off Heligoland.(d) The French radio on the 28th August stated that the motor fishing boatPerseverance struck a mine off St. Nazaire.(e) On the 11th July the Norwegian Troma of 5,029 tons was severely damaged by a &quot;mine, and docked at Rotterdam for repairs which areexpected to take four months.
35. Absolutely reliable information has been received*of the positions ofthe wrecks reported since the 1st June, 1942, in the Baltic and off the frisian islands. Eighteen appear in the former area and seventeen in the latter. Allcoincide with positions in which mines have been laid by Bomber Command, andthe thirty-five wrecks may be assumed to be due to mines laid by the Command.Certain of these wrecks may link up with reports in past Summaries, but it isconsidered that others may be incidents of which no previous information hasbeen received and are additional indications of the success achieved.Effects of F.A.F. Raids.36. The following message from Zurich, dated the 6th September, referring to a statement issued to the German press, is of interest: Dr. Eosenberg, German Minister for Occupied Russian Territories, saidyesterday : &quot; Germany and her allies are entitled to a privileged positionbecause they alone are making sacrifices. Many parts of Europe, even afterdefeat, have not suffered privations like those caused by the R.A.F. in german towns.&quot;A. H. M.
