This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty*s GovernmentPrinted for the War Cabinet, October, 1942SECRET. 30Copy NoW.P. (42) 46826th October, 1942.-TO DE KEPT UNDER LOOK AND key it io rcqucursd that special caro may be taken to enouro theWAR cabinet supply OF BOOKS AND MAGAZINES FOR THE MIDDLE east memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. On his return to this country from his recent tour, the Prime Ministerraised at the War Cabinet (118th (42) meeting, held on 25th August, 1942), theneed for improving the supply of books and periodicals for the troops in theMiddle East, and I was invited to put forward proposals to this end. I accord-ingly submit for the information of my colleagues the various plans I have inmind. If there are any difficulties which I require the authority of the WarCabinet to solve, I will ask for it in due course. At present I am hopeful that what is possible may be done without the need of any special Cabinet authority.2. The present system for the supply of books and periodicals to the army is as follows:   *(a) The Services&apos; Libraries and Books Fund, of which the Lord Mayor ofLondon is Chairman, receives a grant from Army funds from whichbooks are purchased and distributed to the three Services throughthe Services&apos; Central Book Depot. For the financial year 1941-42this grant amounted to  12,000 (together with an additional grant for administrative expenses). For 1942-43, this grant has been increased to  30,000. The Services&apos; Central Book Depot alsopurchases books on behalf of units at reduced rates, and distributesto the Forces books and magazines given by the public.(b) At present 3,500 bound books and 7,700 illustrated magazines and4,000 copies of &quot; Blighty &quot; are being despatched to the Middle Eastfor all three Services each week. In addition, about 500,000 Penguinbooks, purchased by units themselves, have been shipped.(c) In addition to the above figures, the position will be slightly improved by the newly formed Forces Book Club. Units of the three services can subscribe to this Club, a minimum annual subscription being 3, which entitles the unit to a monthly parcel of ten differentvolumes in a special edition similar to that of Penguin books. Booksfrom this source will be sent to the Middle East at once, but as onlyten fresh volumes will be produced each month, the Club will onlygo a little way towards helping the problem.3. The following steps are being taken to improve the position:  (a) The public in the past have made a valuable contribution of books and magazines but this source of supply has recently been dryingup. The Prime Minister on the request of the Lord Mayor hasrecently signed a letter ot appeal to the public for books andmagazines for the Forces overseas, and I am confident that we maylook for a generous response.(b) As a special measure, the Director-General of Welfare and Educationat the War Office has recently despatched about 17,000 books ofthe Penguin type to the Middle East over and above- the regularquantities despatched weekly as in paragraph 2 (6) above.(c) As was shown in the recent Report of the Lord Presidents Sub-Committee on Book Supply (L.P. (B) (42)17), the book publishersare now restricted to 37 per cent, of their pre-war consumption of paper, whilst periodicals and newspapers are only allowed about20 per cent, of such consumption. The War Office have approached the Ministry of Supply with the suggestion that more paper should be
made available for the book and magazine trades on the condition that it is solely used for the purpose of exporting books andmagazines to overseas forces, and have received an offer of an allotment of 100 tons of paper. This will greatly ease the position for the time being.(d) Until some six months ago there was a very large American contri-bution of periodicals and magazines for the Forces, of which thebulk went overseas. This source of supply has been cut off by theban placed on the shipping in bulk of periodicals and magazinesfrom America. I have taken up with the Ministry of War transport the possibility of finding shipping space for literature from this source, and they have suggested that it would not be difficult toarrange direct shipment from the United States to the Middle East.If we can arrange the necessary sorting at the American end to ensurethe exclusion of subversive, pornographic, or unreadably dull litera-ture, we should be able to organize something on tiiese lines, and Iam looking further into the possibility.(e) A similar proposal, on a smaller scale, is that magazines made availablefor the Forces by the American public, could be brought over in small parcels by aircraft crossing the Atlantic without any sacrifice of accommodation for essential war supplies. The Air Ministry aresympathetic to this proposal but here, too, detailed examination ofthe possibilities is necessary.(/) I have also examined the question of printing books in South africa and the Middle East. As far as South Africa is concerned, this isnot a practicable proposition on account of paper difficulties, copy-rights, and other technical difficulties. As far as Egypt is concerned,Messrs. Allen Lane (Publishers of the Penguin series) are trying toArrange for the production of Penguin books in Cairo, though thequantity involved will be very small.4. i would mention that the Ministry of Supply are contemplating a&quot; national recovery &quot; of books campaign for salvage purposes. Without wishing to minimize the urgent need of books for pulping, I suggest that when newprinting is so drastically restricted, every effort is made to ensure that theliterature surrendered by the public is carefully examined with the objectof setting aside all suitable books, etc., for the object which the Prime minister has in view and to which the proposals in this Paper are directed. I havebeen in :ouch with the Ministry on this point and understand that they havethe needs of the Forces very much in mind.5. In the course of discussions with the Lord Mayors Book Fund on the implementation of certain proposals in paragraph 3 above, attention was drawn to an interesting suggestion made by the American military authorities in london for a planned provision of literature for the troops, both British and American,in the various theatres of war. The Americans point out that their own troopsin this country and the Middle East are short of reading matter, and they suggested that in order to economise shipping and distributive agencies, literaturefor all troops in.the United Kingdom, British, American or others, should beprovided from British sources, while America should furnish literaturefor English-speaking troops in overseas theatres, e.g., the Middle East, Persia,India, etc.6. The suggestion referred to in paragraph 5 is in some ways attractive.There   re, however, some obvious disadvantages; our troops abroad might find tLeir reading matter very largely spiced with an American flavour; andselection and censorship frpm the British point of view might not be easy. Buton the other hand the sources of supply in America are much larger thanobtain, at this stage of the war, in this country; literature could be distributed,like munitions of war, on a planned allocation basis, and shipping would beeconomised. At any rate there is, I think, sufficient in the scheme to have itfurther examined in consultation with the American military authorities here,and this, unless my colleagues see objection, I propose to have done. I shall then be in a -better position to form a judgment on the desirability and practic-ability of the proposal.P.J.G.The War Ofice,26th October, 1942.(b42/127)   80   10/42   w.o.p.   11894
