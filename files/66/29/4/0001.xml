/ ih V n r*this  DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 424.September 23, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.THE 1943 PRODUCTION PROGRAMME.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.TWO groups of problems are raised in the memorandum of the Joint war production Staff on the 1943 Production Programme (J.W.P.S. (42) 50 (Final)),circulated under cover of W.P. (42) 416.    ;On the one hand, there are many steps which can and should be taken toincrease the effectiveness with which the resources already devoted to the prosecution of the war are used. On the other hand, we have very shortly todecide in what proportions the last margin of additional resources is to.be divided between fighting and fabrication. The fact that we are nearing the stage of complete utilisation of our man-power means that the distribution now made whether it be done deliberately or in a haphazard way will be irrevocable. Ifthe best use is to be made of the resources of the United Nations as a whole, thedecision should be taken in conjunction with a similar and complementarydecision in the United States.2. One of the major premises of both sets of problems is the ManpowerSurvey, which will shortly be presented, by the Minister of Labour and NationalService. There are, however, certain steps which may be taken on the recom-mendations in paragraph 8 of J.W.P.S. (42) 50, without waiting for this survey.3.   The Report recommends : (i) The   maximum   comb-out   of   non-munition   occupations,   includingNational and Local Government and other Services, combined withthe training of the older men for munitions.   .This is a task which primarily concerns the Ministry of Labour and theBoard, of Trade. I contemplate that as a result of the Survey, the War cabinet will give an indication of the numbers which must be found from this source.Meanwhile, I suggest that the Lord Presidents Committee should consider, inrespect of each of the main occupations, how much further restriction of civiliansupply and convenience is possible.. 4. g      &apos; -    :     &apos; .  - -; &apos;:        , . I - W.      .&apos;(ii) The most drastic steps to get the best results from labour in the munition industries, including better utilisation of existing manufac-turing facilities.I propose that a Board of five persons representing the three supply departments and the Ministry of Labour, together with my representative,should be set up to initiate and co-operate with the appropriate authorities incarrying out the detailed suggestions in paragraphs 31 to 34&apos;of J.W.P.S. (42) 50.
(iii) The urgent reconsideration by each Service Department of its scales of equipment, establishment and reserves, in the knowledge that thealternative to economy will be a reduction in Service man-power.Many aspects of this matter are already being examined as a result ofrecent direction from the Prime Minister. . In order to deal with matters whereparallel action by the services is required or there is a joint interest, it maybe desirable that an authority should be set up similar to that mentioned inthe previous paragraph, under a representative of the Minister of Defence. Itwould be an advantage if the members of this body, though doubtless drawn from &quot;the three Services, should not be regarded as representatives of their services, but that they should be charged, severally and collectively, with theduty of proposing economies of man-power in all the Services.6.(iv) The placing of as many orders as is practicable in overseas countries.especially Canada.This policy is already being applied in part. It would be helpful if theWar Cabinet could give its approval to the policy (set out in J.W.P.S. (42) 52)of keeping existing Canadian capacity fully employed and of placing additionalorders there whenever possible, and particularly for stores to be shipped to overseas theatres. &quot;It should be considered an achievement to transfer anyitem of production to Canada.&quot; If the War Cabinet will give its approval tothis policy, I will take the opportunity of Mr. Howe&apos;s visit to explain it to him.7.(v) An attempt to secure agreement with the United States on a combined production programme and on the long-range assignment of finished munitions.The attempt to produce a combined production programme is running intodifficulties. For the last four months we have been working on the assumptionthat the Combined Chiefs of Staff would provide an Order of Battle from whichrequirements on a strategical basis could be calculated. We should then havean assurance that, in planning production and in allocating finished munitions,British requirements would not be subordinated to demands of lower strategic importance and urgency.   More than that we cannot ask.This plan of action is now threatened with breakdown or at least withpostponement for several months since the United States Chiefs of Staff have declared themselves unable to base their requirements on any strategic plan. Weare thrown back to the position in which our requirements compete with those for an American army swollen beyond the size that could ever be moved out ofthe United States. It is still not too late to reverse this decision. The C.P.R.B.has drawn the Presidents attention to its consequences, and he may act. But inthe meantime we have our own decisions to make, and they will have to be made without knowledge of what we shall receive from America in 1943.In these circumstances, the best that we can do is to lay our plans, not on a self-sufficiency basis for that is impossible but on a basis which assumes thereceipt from America only of the most vital necessities. If this is approved, Ishould propose to explain to the American authorities the quandary in whichwe are placed by the lack of precision in their plans, and attempt to secure some assurance, even if less than a firm commitment, that we shall receive at least what we heed on this minimum basis.This purpose could be served by a report, based on J.W.P.S. (42) 50, butre-drafted to emphasise the choice that is before us in allocating the final margin of our man-power between fighting and producing. The report would argue thatwe would rather take this decision as a result of a combined study, leading toa combined programme of provision of forces and munitions; but that as thisis not likely to be carried through in reasonable time we cannot afford to wait, andmust make the best decision possible on our own. We must ask that, if the time is not yet ripe for the United States to make a final ear-marking of all its &apos;resources, our decision should nevertheless be made with the knowledge andassent of the President and of the Chiefs of Staff which would carry with itthe undertaking that American production will be so planned that the needs ofthe British Services will be fully met.
8. The recommendations of the Joint War Production Staff conclude asfollows :  There should be a prompt study of the man-power survey with a viewto making a comprehensive allocation of the man-power of the country,taking into account the decisions reached in the combined planning ofproduction and making full allowance for all the economies obtained. Thisallocation should determine the ceiling of man-power for the munition industries, and should lead to a decision on the final scale of the Services.I propose that this study of the man-power shortage should be carried outby the Lord Presidents Committee on Man-power at the earliest possible date and a statement of the alternatives drawn up. From this it should be possible totake our decision on how best to dispose of our remaining resources and to see what effect this will have upon our war plans. The same Committee is being asked to consider the man-power aspects of the specific proposals in this paper.(Initialled) 0.
