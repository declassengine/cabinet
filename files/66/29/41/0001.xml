THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1942.SECRET Copy No.W.P. (42) 461.October 9, 1942.WAR CABINET.INDIA.REPORT OF THE AMERICAN TECHNICAL MISSION TO INDIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.THE American Technical Mission, whose report is appended, was sent toIndia on the initiative of the Government of the United States, who had enquire whether the Government of India would agree to the despatch to India of a technical Mission which could examine and report on the possibilities of american assistance in the development of the industrial resources of India as a supply base for the armed forces of the United Nations in the Middle and far east. The Government of India expressed their readiness to receive the mission and invited it to be their guests during its stay in India. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom also expressed their appreciation of the Americaninitiative and their confidence that it would lead to valuable results in supple-menting what had already been done, e.g., by the Chatfield and Roger Missions.The Mission, which was headed by Dr. Henry F. Grady, was composed of theChairman, three members and an executive officer. It arrived in India on the17th April and remained there for five weeks.2. Before leaving India the Mission presented to the Government of india a preliminary report, in which it set forth some of its basic recommendations,while during its stay in India it telegraphed to Washington a number of specificrequests for essential machines, materials and personnel. In its final report theMission submits its recommendations in full, together with the factual data onwhich they are based.3. In addition to its numerous recommendations for the development ofparticular industrial resources, the Mission made one or two general recommenda-tions which were somewhat outside its scope. It expressed the opinion that amuch larger army than now exists could be recruited in India. As to this theCommander-in-Chief advised the Government of India, who accepted his advice,that the question is not one of equipment only. The pace of recruitment and adequate training facilities are equally important, and the Commander-in-Chiefcould not at present recommend acceleration of recruitment. The Mission putforward as sound and feasible a suggestion for the establishment of a &quot;warcabinet&quot; of three of five members of the Governor-General&apos;s Council with complete control of war production in all its phases. This suggestion has alreadybeen met by the establishment of the War Resources Committee with theDefence, Supply, Commerce, Finance and Communications Members as members,and the Viceroy as Pi&apos;esident. General T. J\ Hutton, late Chief of the GeneralStaff in India and G.O.C. in Burma, has been appointed Secretary. ThisCommittee, which sits several times a week, takes broad policy decisions andprescribes time limits for action. One of its tasks is to deal with the industrial and economic recommendations of the Mission.[24473]
4. The Missions final report seems to be a competent and objective piece of work, but of no particular originality or constructive quality. It reproducesclearly and concisely material provided to it by the Indian Supply Department,and it discusses and evaluates various ideas which were brought to its notice in the course of its tour. A good deal has happened in regard to some of the projects since the Mission left India, and the report fails to take account of thisprogress, e.g., the pipe-line north-eastwards horn Bombay, the most importantsection of which is already in hand. Most of the Mission&apos;s numerous recommendations and suggestions, bearing on the development of India&apos;s industrial resources,are sufficiently well related to the war effort and, if given effect, the\r would beof value from&quot;that point of view on the assumption that measures for the expan-sion of production in India, which will take some time to mature, are strategicallydesirable.   But there are various limiting factors in India, such as (a) Transport and Communications.(b) Plant.(c) Power.(d) Raw^ Materials.(e) Skilled Personnel.These are likely to restrict seriously the number of fresh projects which canprofitably be put in hand. The Indian authorities themselves, though desiringto undertake as much as is within their capacity, are well aware of this consideration and seem anxious not to be over-burdened with new projects. Thereare considerations on the American side, too, which operate against the likelihood of American resources being prodigally expended upon projects of doubtfulutility. It is probable, therefore, that, irrespective of the attitude of HisMajesty*s Government, the scale of the suggestions and recommendations of theAmerican Mission will in the course of further examination by the Indian and american authorities be reduced to a comparatively small number.5. We have ourselves made substantial efforts to develop war productionin India&quot; by providing as much plant and skilled personnel as could be madeavailable from the United Kingdom for that purpose,, and our general attitudecan only be that of welcoming well-considered efforts on the part of America todo the same. The case for encouraging the production of war supplies in india is all the stronger to-day than it was two years ago because we have virtuallyreached the limits of our man-power in the United Kingdom, and have, or soonshall have, a balance of productive capacity over our man-power, and, therefore,need to harness our own redundant productive capacity to such man-power resources as are still available elsewhere, e.g., in India. Any steps taken to thisend must have some effect upon the post-war economic situation, though themeasure of this can easily be exaggerated. We have not allowed ourselves to be influenced by this consideration in proceeding with the expansion of war production in India and we should be falsifying our own position if wre allowedit to weigh any more in relation to American assistance than to that which wehave ourselves provided. It is worth noting, incidentally, that the work of tlheAmerican Mission does not seem likely to tend towards the cultivation of closer relations between Indian and American industrial interests. In fact, the mission and the leading industrialists in India impressed each other unfavourably, andon the American side there is evidence of this in the report itself and still more in the opinions expressed confidentially by Dr. Grady upon his return to theUnited States.6. By reason of the measures now being carried to completion in india with resources provided by us we have a big stake in India&apos;s existing productionand could not be expected to support new undertakings which might prejudice the completion and operation of projects upon which we are ourselves counting.Further, we have a special interest in the carrying out of those proposals of theMission which contribute towards the strengthening of the basic deficiencies ofIndia and so strengthen the foundations for the production in which we aivalready interested, and for any further projects which may, with american assistance, be laid upon them.  These are (1) Improvement in Transport and Communications.(2) Expansion of Electric Power Capacity and Provision of EmergencyMotors.(3) Labour Training.(4) Steel Expansion.
siS27. We might, therefore, emphasise the necessity for giving priorconsideration to, and concentrating upon, proposals designed to remedy thesedeficiencies; but we should not do so in such a way as to rule out without due consideration any other specific projects that America and India may agree inwishing and feeling able to proceed with.8. We shall no doubt shortly receive through the joint organs of consultation upon strategic and supply affairs references from the american authorities for our views. There are elements in America which are inclined to obstruct any further proceeding with the recommendations of the Mission. It,. seems to me important that they should not do so with any encouragement from&apos; us. We need not pronounce upon specific projects until they are referred to usthrough the C.P.R.B., or otherwise after the elimination for one practicalreason or another of those which the Governments of the United States and Indiado not propose to pursue. But we can, and should, I submit, indicate our general attitude for the guidance of our representatives in America in their discussions with their American counterparts.9.   I recommend, therefore, that the following points should be regarded assetting out our attitude at this stage : (1) The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government has always been that, withinthe practical limits of the situation, every assistance should be givento the expansion of India&apos;s war industries.(2) The speed at which India&apos;s war industries can be developed depends uponcertain basic factors and, in particular, the supply of skilled labour.(3) Any further expansion of Indian war production will largely depend upon the assistance America can give in providing skilled supervision,and we should be particularly interested to learn what they have inmind under this heading.(4) Action should be concentrated upon crucial factors, e.g., powrer facilities,transport and other communications, labour training, steel production,the improvement of which will serve as a basis both for productionalready designed and for any new measures that are contemplated.(5) Care should be taken not to overload the Indian expansion programme tothe prejudice of projects already in hand upon the execution of whichwe are counting, and in any new project to be undertaken the resultantsaving of shipping is a factor of special importance.(6) While these are our general views, we reserve our opinion upon suchspecific projects as India and America may, after jointly consideringthe report of the Mission, propose to proceed with.L.

FOHETORDEarly in 1942 the Govemnent of India invited the Govora-Bant of the doited States to send a group of American experts to India.    The purpose of the Uisoioa was to advise theGovercasnt of that country on ways and Beans of stimulating the production in India of essential war Materials and todetermine how the United States sight assist most effectively in this effort.    The Govoresent of the United States gladlyaccepted the invitation.    The Department of State, incooperation with the Board of Economic Warfare, selected theBarbers of the American Technical Mission to India, and issueddirectives concerning the soope of the Mission&apos;0 activities.Those appointed were Henry F. Grady, Chairman, H. E. Beyster,Dirk Dskker, A. W. Harrington, and Frank 1. Cuing, executive officer.The Mission left the United States in April 1942 and returned in June, after making a comprehensive survey of theindustrial resources of India and of the possible expansionof production essential to the prosecution of the war.    TheMission is now submitting its report, together with itsseveral recommendations.    To these recommendations the Qovemrment of the United States will give the prompt attention andthe thoughtful consideration which the subject so richly merits.^4 (X      aJUL^Kji-sHenry A.

  &amp; 5.   E 1.REPORT OF THEAMERICAN TECHNICAL MISSION TO INDIAIntroductionThe Government of India extended an Invitation to the Government ofthe United states to send to India a group of experts to investigate theindustrial resources of that country end to recommend ways and means bywhich the Government of the United States could assist In augmentingIndia&apos;* var production.    The Government of the United States acceptedthe invitation, and the Secretary of State appointed, as members of theAmerican Technical Mission to India, Dr. Henry F. Grady (Chairman),Mr. Harry E. Beyster, Mr. Dirk Dekker, and Mr. Arthur W. Harrington.Dr. Frank A. Waring was named Executive Officer of the Mission.   Becauseof its terms of reference, the work of the Mission was directly related to the coomon war effort of the United Nations and was In no way eon.-neoted with the post-war industrial and commercial problems of India.Zhe Mission left Hew York on April 3, 1942, and arrived in He?Delhi on April 17.    It remained in India 5 weeks, leaving Karachi onMay 22 and arriving in Washington on June 2.    During its stay in india the Mission conferred with officials of interested Departments of theGovernment of India and of some of the Provinces and States, and with industrial leaders, business men, and chambers of commerce in New Delhi,Calcutta, and Bombay.    It visited Government munition factories, rail-way workshops, shipbuilding and ship-repair shops, and the principalindustrial plants engaged in the production of war materials in theCalcutta area.    It spent 2 days in inspecting the plants of the TataIron and Steel Company and its allied concerns producing steel castings,tin plate, and wire and cable at or near Jamshedpur.    It visited theprincipal industrial plants of Bombay, including those for automobileassembly and the manufacture of tires, and it spent a day In Inspectingthe port area of that city.    The Mission also visited the port area atKarachi and conferred with officials concerning conditions there end atthe port of Cochin.The Mission at all times received the most cordial cooperation fromofficial 8 of the Government of India, especially those in the supply department with.whom the members were in daily contact.    Mr. Jenkins,Secretary of the Supply Department, was particularly b*lpful.    themembers of the Mission were given every opportunity to confer with all types of industrialists, regardless of their political beliefs andaffiliations, and to visit any and all industrial plants in which theyevidenced an interest.The members believe that the Mission, by its advice, has been ableto suggest much that will be helpful to the Government and industrial -ists of India and that additional assistance will flow from the fulfil I -nent of its recommendations concerning the supply of materials and personnel to further India&apos;s effort to increase its production of muni-tions and other essential goods.    Some of the Mission&apos;e recommendations were designed to expedite the orders for equipment placed prior to theMission&apos;s arrival in India.    Other orderb were placed by the Government
of India and endorsed by the Miesion after conferences with officials- ofthe Government.     In all instances the Missions endorsement was givenonly after a careful investigation of the facts pertinent to eaoh case.The American Technical Mission to India is submitting herewith itsreport to the Government of India and to the Government of the UnitedStates.     Before its departure from India the Hiaeion presented to theGovernment of that country a preliminary report in which it set forthsome of its basic recommendations.     And, immediately upon its returnto the United States, the Mission presented a preliminary report to itsown Government.     In this final report, the Mission submits in full its recommendations, together with the pertinent factual data that impelledtheir formilation.This report is offered in a spirit of constructive suggestion.The Mission is in no sense critical of the efforts which have thus far been made by the Government and the industrialists of India in thedevelopment of war production.     Much has already been done despitegrave handicaps in equipment, materials, and personnel.     But today an even greater effort is required.    With the enemy at their very gates,the Mission is confident that the Government and people of India willrespond to the challenge as did the Government and people of GreatBritain after Dunkirk and the Government and people of the UnitedStates after pearl Harbor.The Strategic Importance of india the Mission believes that India is of great strategic importance tothe cause of the United Nations.     In its opinion this is because Indiacan be utilised as a base for an offensive against the Japanese in burma, because India and Burma are essential links in the efforts ofthe United Hations tc supply China with war materials, and, finally,because India possesses great natural resources which must not only beiept from the enemy, but must also be fully developed for the benefitof the United Hations.    The importance of rapidly developing India&apos;spotentialities for war production has been greatly accentuated by recentmilitary developments in southeastern Asia.     At present there appearto be three principal war fronts of the United nations in their struggle against the aggressors.     These are the Soviet Union front, the India-Burma-China front, and the Australian front.     The military strength ofthat front with which India is associated will be largely determined bythe extent to which that country, limited only by capacity and prac-ticablllty, can become an important arsenal producing munitions essen-tial to the prosecution of the war.     There is, therefore, not only theproblem of producing military equipment to protect India from invasion,but also that of supplying quickly and effectively certain war equip-ment essential to aggressive action in Burma and China.    Currentdifficulties of transportation nay be lessened by an improvement of themilitary situation, but the time factor will continue to be important.The production of military supplies close to a military froiit is obviously vital.It is the opinion of the Mission that a such larger army than nowexists can be recruited in India.     The capacity of that country to mobilise such an army is a vital consideration in any plan to expandits production of war materials.     Indeed, if India can aid the UnitedHations by supplying equipment and by creating an even more formidablearmy of its own, it will be of material assistance in bringing about an early and successful termination of the war.
Organisation of Government and industry at the time of the Mission&apos;e visit, the Government of India ando industries of India, with few exceptions, were not organized on aar basis.     There was no single governmental official or group of officials with the responsibility of directing and coordinating theentire industrial war effort.     Competitive bidding was still requiredIn obtaining supplies of wnny articles.    The Mission found horseshoes,jteel tips for any boots, and railroad switch gear being produced la. aahip-repair pi ant at Bombay, while core than 100 ships waited la theharbor for major and minor repairs.     A large number of the Industrialplants in India were, in fact, mere Jobbing shops producing a variety of articles with a resulting loss in efficiency of production;   yetthere was no central authority to bring about the transfer of machinery and the concentration in production that would be certain to result in increased output.    The railroads, despite increasingly serious conges-tion, were accepting goods for shipment with little regard for their importance or ultimate use.     There was a shortage in electric power,but no serious attempt waB being made to curtail- consumption for non-essential purposes.    An adequate system of priorities had not been developed and, in consequence, essential construction was frequentlydelayed by the lack of requisite materials.    Prices were increasing,but no machinery had been established for their control.The industrialists in India were, with few exceptions, still con-ceraed primarily with profits and apparently did not realise the threatwhich the war had created not only to profits, but to capital as well.Valuable time was lost in debating whether government or industry should pay for plant extensions and, if government was to pay, theterms on which the property might be acquired when the war was ended.Huaerous industrialists were demanding substantial war risk insurance and a guarantee of profits.     Protracted negotiations were necessary before some industries would accept government contracts that were lessremunerative than production for civilian demand.     A number of Indianindustrialists were not in syepethy with the Government of India andstubbornly resisted its efforts to take over plants for war production or to requisition and remove machinery urgently required elsewhere.They appeared to be more concerned with possible conditions in thepostr-war period than with the assistance they might be able to renderin the present emergency.In its preliminary report to the Government of India, the Missionmade the following observations concerning the organization of theGovernment of India and of the industries of India, for the increased production of materials essential to the wart&quot;Political and industrial economy in times of war is very different from that in times of peace.     In a democracy theremust be a considerable element of laissez faire and the profitIncentive in the production and distribution of goods isgenerally recognised.     Initiative and enterprise do not thriveunder regimentation and yet, under the emergency of war, theremust be unification, coordination, the restriction of initiative,the subordination of the profit incentive, and the complete con-oentration of the nation through its government on the defeat ofthe enetay .     Democracies are characteristically slow in con-vert-ing their national organisation from a peacetime to a wartimebasis.     Totalitarian countries which are always mobilized for national objectives have little difficulty in quickly striking
with the full force of their national resources.     Some leaders is our oountry were talking aa late as a year ago of &apos;business asusual1 and of the ability of the oountry to do the war job and tocontinue its normal peacetime activities.    finally, however, welearned that this could not be done and publio opinion in govern-ment, business, agriculture, and labor is now united on the singleobjective of defending the country and its allies against the aggressors.    To accomplish this task it has been necessarygreatly to change our government organization.     Mr. Donald Kelsonhas had delegated to him by the President many of the president1abroad war powers.    He is in effect the czar of war production.It took the United States many months to evolve the War ProductionBoard and its organization under Mr. Nelson.     Development alongsimilar lines was necessary in Great Britain, Canada, Australia,and in others of. the United Nations.&quot;The Government of India has made definite progress duringthe last year in stimulating India,1 a war effort.    Indeed, somebelieve that it has attained its marlnm production under a voluntary system actuated by the profit motive, but therm is stillmush to be done before the complete mobilization of India&apos;o re-sources shall have been attained.    The United States, GreatBritain, and other democratic countries have had a twofold prob-lsa, first, that of augmenting the production of certain peace-time oooaodities needed for war, and secondly, of convertingpeacetime industries to war production.    India has had that saaoproblem.    These two phases of reorganizing and coordinating long-established Institutions can hardly be done without strongcentralized power vested in government and exercised by it.&quot;In India most of the shops now producing war goods areengineering concerns which historically have bean jobbing shops.They have produced a large variety of articles based oa the ordersreceived,    As the Government of India has issued orders for theproduction of munitions and other war goods, those shops, in-eluding the railroad shops, have taken the orders on a &quot;jobbing&apos;basis.    To maximize production it will ba necessary to have abasic change in production technique.    It will be necessary to concentrate machinery and plant on one or two rather than manyarticles.    A few plants in India have developed the mass production-tion technique to a high degree of efficiency, notably the Tataplant producing iron and steel, but many more most be induced oroospelled to do so.&quot;To o on vert a large number of miscellaneous engineeringshops to something approximating the system of &apos;i*.*aembly-lino&apos;production cownon to advanced industrial countries is a difficultundertaking, but it is essential that this be done if India&apos;amarlwnw potentialities for war production are to be realised.It mill be necessary not only to obtain new equipment but also tomove equipment from one shop to another and thus develop a programof concentrated, rather thus scattered, effort.    In army instancessuch a reorganization should also include the rearrangement ofmachinery within existing plants to achieve maxiaum efficiency.
&quot;With the sore general establishment of plants engaged inwar production, the arced forces and the Government of india will have, on a wider scale than heretofore, the problem and responsibility of planning orders sufficiently far in advance to secure and Maintain efficiency of operations.    It is theopinion of the Mission that beneficial results could be obtained by the immediate and general application of such a policy.     Inaddition, a more rigid control of raw materials and the priorityallocation of then will have to be Instituted.    Price fixingwill be required so as to remove unreasonable profits from war production and avoid the disaster of inflation.    It is not theintention of the Mission, however, to recommend any particular form of governmental organisation to accomplish these purposes.The Mission wishes merely to state the problem and let theGovernment and leaders of India determine hers it can best be solved.&quot;The organization of war production in the United states is practically independent of established government agencies.This arrangement has much to contend it, and many who havetalked with tba Mission have stated that something comparable to our syBtem, or to that of Great Britain which is similar,should be adopted in India.    Others have suggested that thaSupply Department, which under present conditions has beanprimarily responsible for war production, should have divorced from it the problems of production and that a new Departmentof Production under the direction of a member of the council should be formed.    It was urged that, if established, such a department might be strengthened by bringing into it, as headsof departments, executives from industry and that to thisorganization might be added production advisers from the UnitedStates.     Still another suggestion is that the Department ofSupply might be converted into a Department of Production and supply with two clearly defined divisions, the functions ofwhich would be segregated in accordance with the new title.A fourth suggestion, which appeals to the Mission as beingsound and feasible, provides for the establishment of a warcabinet of three or five members of the Counoil with an appropriate Secretariat, which would have complete control ofwar production in all its phases.    With membership based onresponsibility for production, transportation and communication,finance, and defense, such a cabinet might direct the war effortmore effectively than could be done under any of the suggestionsoutlined above.&quot;The members of the Mission have been gratified to learn that theGovernment of India has accepted its suggestion regarding governmentalorganization for war production and has established the War ResourcesCommittee of Council which, the Mission understands, is charged with theduty of coordinating and directing India&apos;s industrial war effort.    BisExcellency The Viceroy J.s president of the Committee which consists ofthe Iefense member, the Supply Member (Vice President), the CommerceMember, the Finance Member, and the Communications Member.    The Missionbelieves that this action, together with the appointment of a permanent secretary, represents a substantial advance in Indians program for theintensification of its industrial production.
The expansion of industrial production in India is to be based atleast in part on Lend-Leaae material from the United States, and uponthe advice of technicians from this country whose services have been requested by the Government of India and whose appointment has been recommended by the Hission.     Because of the interest of the UnitedStates in the industrial development of India, the Mission believes that the Government of the United States should appoint an EconomicAdviser as a member of the staff of the American Mission in New Delhi.The duties of such an appointee would be to direct and coordinate, fromthe standpoint of this country, its various economic activities inIndia.     In addition to representing the Department of State in economic matters, he would act for the Board of Economic Warfare and the Land-Lease Administration, and would maintain close contact with represeata-tives in India of the United States Army, the Reconstruction finance corporation, and the United States Maritime Commission so that he mightbe apprised of, and might cooperate with, their economic activities.In order that this special representative might work most effectivelyslth appropriate officials of the Government of India, the Missionwishes to suggest that he be fully informed of the activities of theWar Resources Committee of Council, and of the various Departments con-concerned.     In this way the Mission believes that the efforts of the twoGovernments might be most fully and effectively coordinated.Rec ommend at ions ^*1.   The Mission recommends that the necessary authority and responsibility for the industrial program affecting theproduction of war materials be centralized in an appropriateindividual or group within the Government of India.2.   ihe Mission recommends that the Government of Indiamake every effort to mobilize the industrial resources ofthat country in order that mnxlrnnw production of essential war materials can be obtained.     To assist in achieving this objective, it suggests that:a. Wherever appropriate and possible, existingengineering shops that are in reality jobbing shopsshould be converted into aass-prod action factories;b. The Government of India and the military commandshould make every effort to plan as far as possible inadvance its orders of supplies, and the military oommandshould be requested to reexamine its present supplyprogram in the light of current military developments;c. The Government of India should exercise morerigid control over raw materials and should adopt asystem of priority allocation for their distribution; and d. To prevent the possible disaster of inflation,the Government of India should take steps to introduceadequate measures of price control.1/ In order to facilitate the study of the Mission&apos;s report, thepertinent recommendations are set forth at the end of each section.
3.   The Mission recommends to the Government of theUnited States that it appoint an Economic Adviser on thestaff of the American Mission in Hew Delhi who would super-vise the economic activities of the United States in Indiaand assist in coordinating the progrnTS of the two Govem-ments.     It suggests to the Government of India that this special representative be kept fully informed of theactivities of the War Resources Committee of Council and ofthe various Departments concerned.Eastern Group Supply council the Eastern Group Supply Council was established in the fall of19^0 to coordinate war production and supply in Great Britain, India,Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.     It has accomplished notableresults.     With current developments in the military situation, how-ever, only Tn1^&quot; and South Africa have remained able to make activecontributions to the Council, and South Africa has not been a largeproducer of war materials.     The clearance through the Council of pur-chases from the Government of India on behalf of overseas commands,therefore, would seem no longer to serve a useful purpose.     Accordingly,the mission ventures to suggest that orders from overseas placed on india should be handled directly by the Supply Department of the Govern-ment of India without prior clearance through the Eastern Group supply council.     This is not to be interpreted as a recommendation for the discontinuance of the Council.     It can continue to serve a useful pur-pose by assembling and coordinating information on production and supply in the various countries making up the Group and by disseminating such information to the proper authorities in those countries.Recommendations.1.   The Mission recommends that orders from overseasplaced on India should be handled directly by the supply department of India without prior clearance through theEastern Group Supply Council.2.   It further recommends that the Council be con-tinued as an agency for assembling and coordinating in-formatlon on production and supply for dissemination to theproper authorities in those countries having representation in the Council.Recommendations-Continued.
Transportation and CommunicationThe railway, port, and cooosunioation facilities in India have beenadversely affected by military developments in recent months.     attacks by the Japanese on shipping in the Bay of Bengal have temporarily lm-mobilised the ports on the east coast of India.    This has imposed a greatly Increased burden not only on ports of the west coast, notablyBombay, Karachi, and Cochin, but also on Inland transportation faoili-ties, especially the railways.Railways are by far the most important means of transportation inIndia;    Indeed, it is estimated that they carry more than 92 percentof all land-borne traffic.    Current estimates of the ton-miles borneby railways and roads are as follows:Ton-miles(In Billions)Railways 28,000Roads 450Government ownership of, and interest in, the railways has doubt-less operated to retard the development of other types of transportation.Traffic on the rivers of India might be increased somewhat, but theprincipal rivers, with few exceptions, are not so located as to relieve the railways of such of their present burden.    A substantial program of road construction would, when completed, assist in solving the presentproblem of transportation in India and should certainly be undertakenpromptly.    Such a program, however, would not provide immediate reliefbecause of the time required to implement it.    Moreover, increased useof roads would stimulate the consumption of rubber and gasoline, ofwhich there is already a shortage.    A pipe line across at least a partof India has been suggested to relieve the railways of the recentlyimposed burden of transporting petroleum from west-coast ports to theCalcutta area.    Inasmuch es the total capacity of tank cars in India is inadequate to cope with this single problem, it would appear that theproposal should receive serious consideration, despite the time thatwould be consumed in its execution.     But, even with the development ofthese various alternate means of transportation, the railways willremain the chief instrument for the movement of goods across India.Their maintenance and improvement, therefore, are matters of specialconcern.Railways.There are 48 railway systems in India.    Of these, 13 are class Iroads, each having earnings in excess of $1,500,000 a year;   togetherthey control most of the equipment and trackage in the country.    At theoutbreak of the war the Government of India owned about 75 percent and managed about AO percent of the total route mileage of the Indian rail-ways.     At present the entire railway system is operated under Govern-ment control, which is exercised by a Railway Board in the Department of communications.On March 31, 1941, the total route mileage of the Indian railway system was 41,156, more than nine-tenths of which consisted of) singlelines.    The track mileage of Indian railways was about 56,000, of which11,000 were sidings.    Broad-gage lines (5 ft. 6 in.) accounted for21,154 miles, meter-gage lines (3 ft. 3-3/8 in.) for 15,899 miles, and
narrow-gage (2 ft. 6 in. and 2 ft. 0 in.) for 4,103 ailoa.    Broad-gagelinos conneot all of the important ports of India, except Chittagcng,rlth moat, if not all, of the principal industrial centers.     Meter-gage lines, which were first introduced many years ago principally forthe sake of economy, constitute an iaportant supplementary system and operate chiefly in northeastern India, in Rajputana, and in the extremesouth.     The narrow-gage lines operate largely as feeders to the broad-gage systems.The tractive power of the average locomotive in India is slightlyaore than one-half of that in the United States.     The capacity of theolasB I broad- and meter-gage freight cars, which constitute most ofthe total stock, was 3,619,094 tons, and the capacity of each car isabout 22 tons.     On March 31, 1941, the latest date for which detailedstatistics are available, the motive power and the rolling stock of therailways in India consisted of the following numbers and types ofrehioles:Broad-gage       Meter-gage       Harrow-gageLocomotives!/passenger earsFreight caraS/5,29013,815152,4022,6389,8a59,6005582,0657,232Since March 31, 1941, the railways of India have lost appreciablenumbers of freight cars and locomotives that were sent to assist in the campaign in the Middle East.     These include 230 meter-gage locomotives,6 narrow-gage locomotives, more than 9*000 meter-gage cars of various types, 50 narrow-gage cars, and 2,100 broad-gage oars which were, or are, being converted to standard-gage prior to shipping.Despite the loss in motive power and rolling stock, the railways ofIndia, in the fiscal year 1941-42, handled an appreciably larger volumeof traffic than in the immediately preceding years.     In the fiscal yc.nr1940-41 the railways carried 575,723,000 passengers, an increase overthe previous year of 8.7 percent;   the passenger miles amounted to19,933. million-which was 7.6 percent greater than in the previous year.Statistics of the net tca-niloa moved over the railways in the last fourfiscal years, beginning with 1938-39, are shown in table 1. -Table 1. - Indian railways:   Hot ton-miles moved,to 1941-42e1938-39Tear endingHarch 31Broad-gagez Percent of 2:i Increase :jtover 1938-39 t;Meter-gage: Percent of:   Increase8over 1938-391933-39 -1939-40 -1940-41 -1941-42*1.000 netton-alias18,283,95919,352,82021,041,21623,321,033+5.S5+15.08+27.S5it 1.000 netton-milesti 3,023,616ii 3,226,810:i 3,367,697si 3,650,32546.72+U.38+20.73^Estimated on the basis of operations for 9 months.Source I   Government of India, Department of Communications&apos;,Railway Board.1/ on March 31, 1939, broad-gage locomotives numbered 5,300, andnarrow-gage, 2,602.2/ On March 31, 1939, broad-gage freight cars numbered 149,131, andmeter-gage, 59,090.
It is obvioue that such an Increase in traffic could be handledonly by an improved utilization of the locomotives and rolling stock ofthe Indian railways.    This improvement is reflected in the statisticsgiven in table 2.Table 2; - Indian railways:   Net ton-miles moved per locomotiveday and per wagon day, 1938-39 to 1940-41Tear ending    : March 31       :	Broad-gage                            Meter-gage	1938-39 - 1939-40 -- 1940-41 ---	Net ton-miles per locomotive day on line		:              15,1M :              15,776 i              17,154	7,019 7,467 7,6371938-391939-40. 1940-41Net ton-miles per wagon day351367392U71581631938-391939-401940-411938-391939-401940-41Engine-nilea per day per engine on line76&quot;81837877Wagon-miles per wagon day40.241.342.930.932.933.1Source:of India.Railway Board, Department of Communications, GovernmentDespite the advance thus far made in the utilization of motivepower and rolling stock, the Mission is of the opinion that further improvement can be effected, and indeed must be, if the railways ofIndia are to perform the task of transportation essential to the prosecution of the war.     The railways are now seriously overburdened,and evidences of an actual break-down are becoming increasingly appar-ent.     Finished goods at steel mill3 and other plants are accumulatingfor want of transportation, and inventories of essential raw materials are declining below the danger, point because incoming shipments are notkeeping pace with requirements.     This condition is due to a number of factors, among the most important of which are the following:1.   The dosing of the east-coast ports by enemy action in the bay of Bengal. - Of the seven principal ports of India, four (Madras,Vizagapatam, Calcutta, and Chittagong) are located on the east coast.These four ports, which in 1941 handled approximately 11,000,000 tons,or about one-half of the total ocean-borne traffic of India, were atthe time of the Mission&apos;s visit almost totally inactive because of thepresence of the Japanese in the Bay of Bengal.     All essential exports from these ports,- formerly carried directly by sea, had to be trans-ported across India by rail before they could be loaded on ocean-going vessels.     This placed a tremendous additional burden on the railroads,particularly in the Calcutta area, which alone customarily accountedfor about 9,000,000 tons of ocean-borne traffic.     Among the principal
products now requiring rail transportation are aoal, jute and juteproducts, pig iron, manganese, and tea.     These commodities, together*lth a few other strategic ones such as linseed, mica, and shellac,aggregate nearly 4,000,000 tons annually;   their movement from Calcuttato Bombay would necessitate the daily allocation of about 700 railwaycars.     Imported products also present a serious problem.     Approxi-mately 1,650 tank oars are required fco provide the quantity of petro-petroleum  products necessary for the Calcutta district, and ths stock of tank cars in all India is only 1,500.     In addition, there is the prob-lem of providing railway transportation for the various foodstuffsformerly imported Into Calcutta.     Inasmuch as the Calcutta districtaccounts for about two-thirds of the industrial activity of India, themaintenance of a flow of essential traffic to and from that areaassumes a special importance.2.   The increased traffic arising out of the greater industrial production caused by the war. - As in most oountries involved in thewar, industrial activity in India has been stimulated and generalemployment and purchasing power have been increased.     This has been reflected in a greater movement of passengers and traffic over therailroads.     Moreover, the enlarged demand-upon the railroads hasoperated to prevent the accumulation at plant sites of inventories of essential raw materials, such as coal and iron ore, during seasons ofoff-peak traffic.3.   The greatly increased movement of troops and military supplies.4.   The loss of rolling stock and locomotives sent to assist inthe campaign in the Middle East.Ordinarily 1,500 freight oars are built each year in the railway workshops of India, but the railways are now 1 year in arrears on thisprogram, in part because of their inability to obtain essential equlp-ment from the United Kingdom.     The Tata Iron and Steel Company, how-ever, has recently installed a wheel and axle plant which should re-lie ve a part of this difficulty.Broad-gage locomotives are not built in India, the essentialfacilities for such construction not being available there.     orders placed in the United Kingdom have been long delayed;   at present,delivery is awaited on 66 locomotives and the number would have been much greater had not additional orders been prohibited.     Broad-gagelocomotives are urgently required.    When the war began (1939), 574engines were awaiting renewal, based on a life of 35 years;   by 1945,1,495 broad-gage locomotives, or 29 percent of the total stock as ofMarch 31, 1941, will be in need of replacement after allowing for the66 on order.The construction in India of 10 to 15 meter-gage locomotives perannum has been carried cn for some time.     This program, however, is inadequate to meet requirements.     At the outbreak of the war 366 meter-gage locomotives were due for replacement after 35 years of service,and by 1945 this number will have increased -to 829, or 35 percent of thetotal stock as of March 31, 1941.Despite the loss of four railroad workshops to the Government forthe production of munitions, officials of the Government of India statethat the repair of rolling stock and locomotives has been adequatelymaintained.     The unusual demand for equipment, however, has kept the
rolling stock, and locomotives in use when they would ordinarily be re-turned tc the shops for repair.     Efforts have been made to reduce to aminimum the number of locomotives and cars under repair.    The goal forlocomotives, for example, is no more than 12 percent of the total.     Theaverage time required for the periodic overhaul of locomotives in themain workshops was, in March 1942,   37 days for broad-gage locomotives and 35 days for mater-gage;   the corresponding pre-war figures were 40days and 32 days, respectively.    The average time required for the over-haul of freight oars in March 1942 was 6.7 days for broad-gage cars and.9 cays for meter-gage cars;   the corresponding figures for the months immediately preceding the outbreak of war were 7.4 and 8.9 days, resrec-tively.2/  A statement of the rolling stock on Indian railways oat or service for repair is given in table 3.Table 3. - Rolling stock of Indian railways out of service for repair, pre-war and current:        Broad-gage	Meter-EasePeriod                 : s^ab&amp;r   * Percent : 3           : of total	Humber   ! :                : of totalSopt.-2ov. 1938Sept.-Mov. 1941March-May 1939March-May 1941June-Aug. 1939June-Aug. 1941Sept.-Bov. 1938Sept.-Mov. 1941Dec. 1938, Jan.-Feb. 1939 -:Deo. 194i, Jan.-Feb. 1942 -:Deo. 1938, Jan.-Feb. 1939 -:Dec. 1941, Jan.-Feb. 1942 -:Barch-May 1939--1March-May 1941-:June-Aug. 1939 -1June-Aug. 1941-19798339658509698989949036,8317,1285,8408,2496,6128,6386,994Locomotives18.515.718.016.018.3Iy.01S.817.1302310277264293293324322Freight cars17597&quot;1,7861,6631,6292,0381,9552,U51,95113.013.112.011.112.612.414.013.62793.23.02.93.73.53.83.5Source: Government of India, Department of CoKsunications,Railway Board.1/ In all casos the average number of days in shops includes Sundaysand holidays.
17Porte.Prior to the outbreak of the war India ranked about tenth amongthe trading nations of the world.    Its position was probably higher in1941-42.     The total foreign commerce in India has aggregated apprcod.-mately 22,000,000 tons, which were divided about equally between imports and exports.     Although India has an extensive coast line with manyports, only a few are considered suitable for use throughout the year, even ports account for more than 75 percent of India&apos;s total foreign trade.    These ports are Karachi, Bombay, Cochin, madras, Visagapataa,Calcutta, and Chittagong, of which only the west-coast ports (Karachi,Bombay, and Cochin) have natural harbors.The closing of the east-coast ports by enemy action in the Bay of bengal has thrown a tremendous burden on the west-coast ports which must now handle all of the ocean-borne traffic entering and leaving India,whereas prior to 1942 they had accounted for leas than one-half of thetotal.     The congestion of shipping at Karachi, Bombay, and Cochin hasbecome acute, and there is confusion in moving cargoes to and from the docks.    The congestion at Karachi and Cochin, though pronounced, is less serious than at Bombay, now the principal port of India.    OnMay 20, 1942, there were more than 200 ships waiting in the harbor of bombay to discharge cargo or to obtain needed repairs, and the averageturn-around of ships was reported to approximate 6 weeks.     In view ofthe current shortage of shipping and its importance to the UnitedHations, the Mission deems it vital that harbor facilities in the west-coast ports of India for unloading and repair be improved as rapidly aspossible.Port facilities at Karachi and Cochin are inadequate to handle thesharp increase in the traffic which occurred in the first 6 months of1942.    Port officials discussed with the Mission the additional equlp-ment urgently required to permit them to cope with the increased ton-nages, and the Mission agreed to support orders for such equipment whenthey had been cleared through the Supply Department, and placed on theLand-Lease Administration by the Indian purchasing Mission.The port of Bombay is administered by the Bombay Port Trust, aseparate public body created by and operated under the control of the communications Department of the Government of India.     The Port Trustoperates as a commercial organization as well as a public service body in managing the various facilities of the port.    These include threewet docks with 4*42 miles of quays and a total water area of 104*52acres.    In addition, the Trust controls deep-water tidal berths at three places, two drydooks, 121.8 miles of railway, and 8.12 miles ofwharves and bunders used by coastal Balling vessels.     The total portarea comprises 1,880 acres.     The facilities of the port were used inthe fiscal year 1941 to handle a monthly average of 419,420 tons of cargo in the entire port area.    Of this amount, 245,000 tons, orslightly more than one-half, were loaded or discharged at the. docks.The remainder represented cargoes taken from or to ships anchored inthe outer harbor or tied at the bunders.     The three wet docks togetherha ye berths for approximately 45 vessels.     The Alexandra Dock, the new-eat and largest of the three, can berth 17 vessels drawing 32 feet andnot exceeding in length 475 feet.    The Victoria Dock can handle 14ships with a draft of 24 feet and not exceeding 430 feet in length.Prince&apos;s Dock, the oldest of the three, has seven cargo berths and sevenvrepair berths;   it can handle ships which draw 20 feet and which do notexceed 400 feet in length.     There are deep-water tidal berths at
Ballard pier and along the Alexandra Dock harbor wall.    The berth atthe Ballard Pier is SCO feet long and 30 feet deep, and that at theAlexandra Dock harbor wall, 1,692 feet long and 25 feet deep.     There isalso a berth at Pir Pan which is 570 feet long and 29 feet deep, andwhich is used principally for tankers.In addition to its docking facilities, the Bombay Port Trustoperates two drydocks, one of which is 1,000 feet long, 100 fact wide,with a 22-foot sill, and a normal depth of water over the sill of 33feetj   the other is 525 feet long, 65  feet wide, and has 22 feet ofwater over the 14-foot sill.     There are also two private docks in bombay, one 495 feet long and 66 feet wide, and the other 400 feet longand 665 feet wide.    The Royal Indian Navy operates three drydockB, themwT-twiTm lengths of which are 640 feet, 380 feet, and 256 feet, respec-tively.    There are three private companies engage1 in shipbuilding and ship repairing in Bombay.     At the time of the Mission&apos;s visit (May1942), no 8hip-repair work was being done by the workshops of the PortTrust.The equipment for the loading, unloading, and repair of ships atBombay, while adequate under ordinary circumstances, has proved totally inadequate to cope with the recent tremendous increase in traffic.Prompt and drastic steps must be taken if the materials essential to theUnited Nations are to be moved in and out of India.    The Mission,therefore, has made a number of recommendations designed to facilitate the handling of cargo and the repair of ships at Bombay.Roads, airways, and waterways.Roads. - On March 31, 1939, there were 319,000 miles of roads inIndia.     Of these, 99,000 miles were classified as unsuitable for motor vehicles, 122,000 miles aa fair-weather roaas, and 98,000 miles as all-weather roads.     Of the last-named group, 66,000 miles were water-boundmacadam and 32,000 miles were asphalt.    Most of the macadam roads arein the Provinces of Madras, Bombay, and the United Provinces.     Theasphalt roads are chiefly in the Indian States of Mysore, Hyderabad, andTravancore.     Bengal, Bihar, the Punjab, and the United Provinces havethe greatest mileage of fair-weather roads.The four principal highways in India are the trunk roads whichextend from Calcutta to the Khyber, from Calcutta to Madras, from Madrasto Bombay, and from Bombay to Delhi.     These through-roads parallel therailways as do other main roads in the country.     They are far less important, however, than the railways in the movement of commodities and people.     In general, it may be said that India&apos;s roads are inadequate for the peacetime requirements of the oountry;   they are altogether in-adequate for wartime requirements.The total number of motor vehicles registered in India an January1941 was 123,400, of which 77,000 were passenger cars, 26,200 werebusses, 18,800 were trucks, and 1,400 were diftsel units.     Additionalmotor vehicles are, of course, being operated by the armed forces inIndia, but no data are available concerning their number.     The Army,however, has requisitioned 3,700 new vehicles imported for civilian use and 1,800 used vehicles in the 2 years ending June 1942.     In addition,a number of trucks have been hired by the Army for the training ofdrivers, and many more are being used in the construction of roads, air-ports, army camps, and supply depots.     To maintain the present capacityof busses and trucks, already insufficient, at least 10,000 vehicles
175would have to be Imported.    The Importation of replacement parts isalso essoatial to the maintenance of this traffic.     It is possible, ofcourse, that commercial transportation by motor vehicles will be furthercurtailed by shortages of gasoline and tires.airways. - Air transportation has not been greatly developed inIndia.    Only two companies operate regular service between importantcenters of population.     Tata Sons, Ltd., the rore important of the two companies, maintains services over the three following routes:(1) Karachi, Hruj, Ahmedabad, Bombay, Hyderabad, Madras, Trichlnopoly,and Colombo;   (2) Bombay, Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior, and Delhi;   and (3)Bombay, Goa, Cannanore, Trivandrum, and Trichlnopoly.     The totalaileage of these routes is 3,791.     The other company, the indian national Airways, operates between Karachi and Calcutta via Jacobabad,Uultan, Lahore, Delhi, Cawnpore, and Allahabad.    The services main-tained by these two companies are almost exclusively for passengers andmail;   very little freight is transported by air.    Although there are alarge number of airports in India, many of them are small, with in-adequate runways.     In fact, few airports in India have runway6 suffi-oiently long and reinforced to permit their use by United States &quot;flyingfortresses11 and other heavy, aircraft.Waterways. - Inland waterways are of importance in the Provinces of bengal, Bihar, Assam, and in parts of Madras.    Although no data areimmediately available concerning the volume of traffic, steamers and5Timn river boats operate on the river systems of these areas, carryingsugar, grains, and molasses from the Ganges Basin, tea and jute from east Bengal, and tea from Brahmaputra and Surma valleys in Assam tourban centers.     With the exception of a few companies operatingsteamers on rivers in the Provinces of Bengal and Assam, transportationon inland waterways is unorganized, and individual boat owners pre-doainate.Coaaamicationa. - The postal and telegraph services of India are controlled by the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs whose office is attached to the Department of Communications.    The telegraph facill-ties of India have been extended considerably in recent years and facilities are nor: available in all of the larger cities.    On March 3,1938, there were 101,068 miles of line, including cable, and 618,605miles of wire in India;   257 departmental telegraph offices and 4,053other telegraph offices were operated by the post office.    On the same date there were 463 telephone exchangee in India and about 80,000telephones.    Since 1927 India has been connected by wireless with theUnited Kingdom and that service has sinoe been expanded to meet the wireless requirements of aircraft and shipping.    In 1933 radio-telephone service between Indie and the United Kingdom was Inaugurated, and this service which was at first restricted to Bombay has now been expanded toinclude all of the important cities in India.    Despite the extension ofthese various services the Mission found that war demands h^d placed a severe burden upon them.    As a result, it is frequently impossible to transmit messages quickly by either phone or telegraph.    Indeed, it wasnot unusual for mailed confirmations of telegraphic orders to arrivebefore the orders themselves.
RecownffndBtlonB.1.   Because of the seriousness of the problem of railtransportation in India, the Mission believes that efforts should be Bade to secure additional broad-gage locomotives and to increase the production in India of cator-gagslocomotives and of freight cars and other essential rolling stock.2.   The Mission has urged the most efficient possible use of available equipment, Including a quicker &quot;turn-around&apos; for cars and the possible utilization of third-classpassenger cars for freight.3.   It suggests that serious consideration should begiven to the installation of a pipe line from Bombay toCalcutta or to some central point, :uch as Allahabad, forthe transportation of petroleum products, and that provision should be made for the manufacture of the pipe in India.A.   It approved a 50-percent curtailment in passenger traffic and suggested the possibility of a further reduction.5.   And it recommended that three top-ranking railwayexecutives from the United States be sent to India to assist in obtaining iwrlmiim efficiency in operations.6.   The Mission recommended a substantial Increase inthe utilization of bunders (rock-walled jetties) for theloading and unloading of ships in the outer harbor.    Forthis purpose it recommended the construction in India of alarge number of barges and tugs, and agreed to endorse ordersby the Government of India placed on the Lend-Lease Adminis-tration for the motors that would be required for the tugs.It approved the construction of temporary storage sheds andof spur tracks on the bunders in order to facilitate theloading and unloading of the bargee or lighters.     And itagreed to use its influence to secure from the United Statesan adequate number of mobile cranes for this work.7.   To secure the &quot;^i&quot;is utilisation of existing equip-ment at the regular docks, the Mission strongly advocatescontinuous operation in three 8-hour shifts.!/   It recommends that the penalties charged for work at night and on Sundaysand holidays be abolished^/   In their stead, it suggests the\J At the time of the Mission^ visit, a day shift was working from:00 to 12:30 and from 1:30 to 6:00, and a night shift from 7:30 to3:30.     The Mission was informed that the cargoes were rarely workedfor the full 17 hours.2/ At the time of the Mission&apos;s visit, only two entrance gates to theAlexandra Cock and two to Victoria Dock were kept open between 6:00 p-m.and 6:00 a.m., unless a special customs fee was paid for additional facilities.     For each railway gate that was opened on Sundays orholidays, a customs charge of 200 rupees was made.     If cargo was td beleaded or unloaded on Sundays or holidays, a fee of 300 rupees wascharged by the Port Trust and an additional fee of 200 rupees by thecustoms.     Those fees operated to retard the most efficient utillza-tion of port facilities.
17imposition of progressive penalties if export cargoes are notavailable on the docks so that loading operations may be com-menced as soon as the unloading of the ship is completed.8.   The Mission does not approve the practice of sendingnegotiable bills of lading by ships following the actualcargo which such bills cover, and suggests that, Inasmuch as this practice has often caused considerable delay in clearingcargoes, the negotiable bills of lading should accompany the cargoes to which they pertain, or be despatched via air mail.9.   The Mission was disturbed to find that ships were leaving the harbor of Bombay with inadequate fuel and water supplies because the facilities there could not providepromptly the necessary quantities.     It recommends, there-fore, that these facilities be expanded as rapidly aspossible.10.   The Mission was informed of, and indeed saw for it-self, the congestion of cargoes on the docks of Bombay.     Iturges that every effort be made to clear promptly thesecargoes by rail;   should this prove impossible, it suggeststhat cargoes be removed by motor truck to temporary storage.11.   Because of the congestion at the port of Bombay, theMission recommends that full consideration be given to theutilization of other west-coast ports.     It is ready to sup-port orders for essential equipment at the ports of Karachiand Cochin when approved by the Department of Supply.     Itwishes also to call the attention of the Government of Indiato the Kathiawar ports, the facilities of which, it under-stonds, are not now being fully employed.12.   The Mission recommends that an expert be sent fromthe United States to advise the Government of India on theimprovement of harbor facilities in the west-coast ports inorder that the congestion there may be relieved.13.   Although the construction of additional all-weatherroads in India may not be of immediate assistance in solving the acute problem of commercial transportation, the Missionbelieve8 that such roads would be of great military impor-tance and value.     It recommends, therefore, that a programof road building should be undertaken without delay, and is ready to assist in obtaining for the Government of India the requisite equipment.14* The Mission recomnends the expansion and adequateequipment of airports in India, particularly those strata-gically located for both offensive and defensive operations.IS.   The Mission recommends that efforts be made to stimulate the transportation of materials by inland water-ways.     It particularly urges the use of waterways, where practicable, to relieve the railroads in the movement of bulkfreight, such as coal, to and from Calcutta.Recomcendations-Continued.
RftftfMtPendatlona-Con tinned .16.   The Mission reoowenria that the Government of Indiaundertake a survey of Its telephone and telegraph systems Inorder to ascertain what steps need be taken to Improve these services.PetroleumMost of the petroleum resources of India are located In the Attookfield In the Punjab and the Digboi field in Assam which produce, annu-ally, 30,000,000 gallons and 66,000,000 gallons, respectively.    Thisproduction is small in relation to India&apos;s needs, constituting about 15percent of ordinary requirements, excluding the demand from China andthat arising out of the increased activity of the air and other militaryforces in India.    Most of the petroleum requirements of India have, inthe past, been supplied by Burma, the Netherlands Indies, and Iran,although substantial quantities of lubricating oil were imported fromthe united States.     The loss of Burma and the Motherlands Indies hasplaced India in the difficult position of having to import large quanti-ties of petroleum products principally from the United States.    A sub-stantlwl part of its needs, however, can be obtained from the persian gulf ports of Bahrein and Ahadan.     Imports which must be greatly in-creased are now controlled by the Petroleum Department in London, butthe Government of T&quot;^&quot; assumes that future supplies will be forth-coming from either the Persian Gulf or the United States.There are two refineries in India.    One is located at Digboi,Assam, and has a dally capacity of 6,500 barrels;   it is operated by theBurmah Oil Company which is affiliated with the Anglo-Iranian oil company.     The other refinery is situated at Rawalpindi, Punjab;   ithas a daily capacity of 4,000 barrels, and is operated by the Attack oil company.     These two refineries have a dally cracking capacity of 2,100barrels each and are equipped to produce 70-octane to 80-octane gasoline.Estimates of probable future consumption of petroleum products inIndia were given in a memorandum submitted to the Mission by the Govern-ment of India.    A part of this memorandum is reproduced below.&quot;Estimated consumption, where possible, with brief cosssnts isgiven here for the different main products.    Figures are collatedIn table 4.&quot;A.

1Exploration for petroleum.A moratorium on all prospecting in India was imposed at the instance of the United Kingdom in September 1940.     Since then, variouasources of supply for petroleum have been lost to the United Nations,and it now appears desirable to develop further the fields in India.Should prospecting be resumed, however, the Government of India has stated that assistance would be required from the United States, or elsewhere, in the provision of technical personnel, prospecting equip-ment, and ultimately of equipment for refineries.Industrial alcohol.Industrial alcohol can be produced in India from molasses, now aHaste byproduct of the sugar industry.     Two plants for the manufactureof industrial aloohol, having an annual capacity of 750,000 gallonseach, are already on order in the United States, and tho Government ofIndia wishes to place orders for 10 additional plants of comparablecapacities.     In view of the greatly increased demand in India for petroleum products, including motor fuel, it would seem desirable to stimulate the production of industrial alcohol and thus conserve petro-petroleum , refining capacity, and shipping space.Drum containers.A further problem pertaining to petroleum products in India isthat of containers necessary for the transportation and storage of such products.     The production of 5-gallon tin containers is adequate tomeet Indian requirements.     The Government of India, however, has esti-mated that additional drum-making equipment oapable of producing 80,000drums a month will be required to meet the increased demands of the armed forces of India, the United States, and China.Re commendations.1.   The Mission assumes that arrangements have been made through the Petroleum Department in London to secure for Indiaits requirements of. petroleum and petroleum products.   Shouldthe Government of India fail to receive adequate supplies tomeet military and essential civil inn demands, the Missionagrees to lend its assistance.2.   To insure the receipt in India of adequate suppliesof aviation gasoline (100-octane) and for other strategicreasons, the Mission has recommended that a refinery be estab-11 shed at Bahrein to augment the quantities now being madeavailable at Abadan.3.   The Mission recommends that the exploration of potentialities-tial petroleum fields in India be resumed, and is ready toassist the Government of India in obtaining needed supplies and personnel.
Rsoomaendationa-Continue d.4.   The Mission recommends that the material and equip-aant required for the construction of 12 planta for the pro-duotlon of industrial alcohol be made available to theGovernment of India under provisions of the Lend-Leaee Act.5.   The Mission recommends that the neceasary equipment for the manufacture of 80,000 drums a month be made availableto the Government of Tndla under the provisions of the Lend-Leaae Aot,Electric PowerIndia&apos;s electric power is produced almost entirely to meet Indus-trial demands.     The proportion of the total load consumed in buildings and private homes is quite small.    Much of India&apos;s electrical ganerat-ing capacity is owned by private utilities, Provincial and StateGovernments, and municipalities, although a number of Industrial oon-cerns own and operate plants producing electrical energy for their con-sumption alone.     The investment in all these plants amounts to about$300,000,000 and their annual capacity to about 2,700 million kilowatts.The distribution of electrical generating plants in India is un-even, being concentrated in the principal industrial centers and in theport cities.    The productive capacities of these plants in kilowattsare indicated below by principal districts.Province or State Capacity (kilowatta)j^/Bengal 3666,000Bombay 3/310,000United Provinces VuQ,000Madras 5/l29,QC0Bihar Sail, 000Punjab 97,000Mysore State 61,000Delhi 31,000The Provinces of Bengal and Bombay, in which are located thelargest ports and industrial centers of the country, are by far theleading producers of electric power.     Because of their location andprevious industrial development, these two Provinces have also been thecenters of most of the expansion of war industries.    As a result the57 The capacities of self-contained factories are not included,except as noted.2/ Of this amount 289,000 kilowatts are in the Calcutta area and26,000 are at the Steel Corporation of Bengal.2/ Principally the port area and city of Bombay, including railways.tf Of this amount 43,000 kilowatts are in the city of Madras.5/ Of this amount 64,000 kilowatts are in Cawnpore.2/ Of this amount 80,000 kilowatts are produced by the Tata Iron andSteel Company, Ltd.
shortage of generating plants is sore acute in these two Provinces thanelsewhere. Except for Cawnpore and the Presidency of Madras, however,there is very little reserve power in any of the Provinces or States ofIndia. Power, therefore, mat be a prime consideration in any programinvolving either the movement of existing industries or the establiah-aent of new industries.To prevent the consumption of eleotrieal equipment and wire fornonessantial purposes, and to conserve surplus generating capacity,governmental control has been established over all generating and dis-tributing systems in India.    This control is exercised by a new agencyknown as the Central Electric Power Control Board, of which the Elee-trioal Commissioner is a member.    Shortly after its creation the Boardissued orders to ell utilities in India, prohibiting any new serviceconnections that are not essential for war needs.The Government of India anticipates the Installation of a number ofextensions to plant capacities la electrical utilities by the middle of1943.    From orders already placed for generators it is expected that12, with capacities aggregating 40.750 kilowatts, will reach India be-fore the end of 1942 and will be in operation a few months thereafter.Mo6t of this equipment, however, 1b designed to meet overloaded condl-tions in the various utilities by which it was ordered.     A project to expand the Tata Hydroeleotric System in the Bombay area will provideabout 16,000 kilowatts of firm peak capacity and about 130,000,000kilowatts annually, but most of this power will be required to meet the.increased demands of existing consumers, including the railways.   Thereis also a project designed to increase the production of electricalenergy at Jog Falls, in Mysore, by 48,000 kilowatts.     This additional capacity will be fully utilised by the new plants that are now beinginstalled there for the production of war materials.     It is essential,therefore, that this project be completed promptly.Recommendations.1.   The Mission recommends that the projects for theexpansion of the production of electrical energy in Bombayand Mysore be completed as rapidly as possible and that everyeffort be made to expedite the delivery of other electricalgenerating equipment now on order.2.   The Mission recommends that, whenever the demand ofwar industries for electrical power exceeds the supply, theCentral Electric Power Control Board should curtail theservices extended to nonessential consumers or to consumerswhich are not in a position to utilize the total load cus-tomarily made available to them.     The jute mills, forexample, are operating at very much less than capacity.    Inthe Calcutta area a substantial saving of power could beeffected by concentrating production in those jute millsnecessary to supply current demands and by closing the others.
Reooinmendatloao-Contlnuad.3.   The Mission is of the opinion that, for a long-termprogram, attention should be given to the development ofhydroelectric power.     But, inasmuch as the completion of most projects of this nature would require several years, theMission does not believe that they should be considered as apart of any program to increase the production of war materi-als in India.    In fact, the Mission recommends that the launching of any substantial hydroelectric projeots be delayed until the war is ended.    Meanwhile, to provide thepower necessary for the expansion of Indian industry, theMission suggests the installation of steam or diesel plantsfor the generation of electrical energy.Steel is basic to industrial production of almost every kind.   the steel industry, therefore, is a key industry and the production ofsteel is often regarded as an index of a country&apos;s general industrial production.     India is fortunate in having an efficiently operatedsteel industry and in having within its own borders all of the rawmaterials essential to the manufacture of steel.     Its deposits of iron ore are high-grade and very large.     Its deposits of coal are adequate&apos;to support for many years a much bigger steel industry than the present one, and its deposits of manganese ore much more than adequate for thatIron ore. .India is the second largest producer of iron ore in the BritishBnpire, being exceeded only by the United Kingdom.     About 3,000,000tons of iron ore are mined annually in India.    Mining operations arecentered chiefly in the Singhbhum district of Bihar, and in nearbyStates;   small quantities are also mined in Mysore State.     Almost all of the iron ore mined in T1-&quot;^&quot; is sent to iron works within the countryfor smelting, but in past years substantial quantities were exported to japan.     Exports from India are now chiefly in the form of pig iron and amount to about 500,000 tons annually, all of which are shipped to theUnited Kingdom.The reserves of iron ore in India are probably the largest in theworld and are superior in quality to those of any other country.    Inthe Singhbhum district alone, the reserves of iron ore with an ironcontent in excess of 60 percent are estimated at not less than 3,000million tons and may amount to as much as 20,000 million tons.     InBaatar State the reserves are estimated at 724,000,000 tons of high-quality ore.     There are also important deposits in neighboring dis-tricts of the Central Provinces, one of which in the Rajhana Hills isestimated to contain 2,500,000 tone of ore with a 67^-percent ironIron and Steelcontent.1/ See section on Honferroua metals, Manganese ore.

In addition,there are coal resources ranging from 60 million to 80 million tons inthe Iangrin plateau of Assam, and 70 million tonB in Nongstoin.     Re-serves of coal suitable for the manufacture of metallurgical coke havebeen estimated at 500 million to:;c;, of which approximately one-halfnill be lost in the process of mining under existing methods;    thesereserves are being consumed at the annual rate of about 15 million tons,and are being used largely for purposes other than the manufacture of coke.     Should the reserves of coal suitable for coke be devoted axolu-slvely to that purpose, they would last for many years, even though theproduction of iron and steel should be greatly increased.     The cokingcoal of India, although satisfactory for smelting purposes, is not ofthe best quality, having a substantial ash residue.The total production of coal in India has ranged from 25 million tons in 1937 to 29 millioa tons in 1940.     Exports of coal from India inrecent years have amounted to about 2 mill ion tons.     Table 7 shows theannual production of coal in India, together with the amounts used forthe manufacture of coke and the quantity of coke produoed therefrom.Table 7. - Production of coal and coke in India, 1937-40(In thousands of tons)Year	Coal	Coal used for   : coke making     :        Coka1937 - 1933 ------ 1939 -- 1940 ---	25,036 28,343 27,769 29,383	2,638         j      lj867 2,398         :      1,711 2,694         :      1,917 2,985         :      2,109Source:   Department of Supply, Government of India.
Iron and steel industry.Production. - The nnminl production of pig iron in India tobo from1,750,000 tons in 1939 to 2,000,000 toaa in 1942.    Modifications in existing furnaces s-y further increase production to 2,100,000 in 1943.Of this amount, it was planned that about 500,000 tons would be exported to the United Kingdom, 100,000 tons would be used in the iron foundriesof India, and the remainder would be consumed in the production of steel.Prior to the *t&amp;r the total annual output of finished steel in India was750,000 tons.     Since then, plant capacitor and annunl production havebeen increased;   in 1942 production was at the annual rate of 1,200,000tons.    And this nay be Increased to 1,500,000 tons by projects for theexpansion of plant capacities now under consideration.Producing companies. - The Tata Iron and Steel Company, located atJamshedpur about 150 miles west of Calcutta, accounts for approximately75 percent of the total production of steel in India.     It is reportedto be the largest single steel plant in the British Empire.     The plantis equipped with modem machinery which is efficiently operated.     the steel Corporation of Bengal has the second largest plant in India and accounts for about 17 percent of that country&apos;s production.     It, too,is equipped with modern and efficient machinery.    The Government Metaland Steel Factory at Tshapore is the third largest steel plant in thecountry, but produces only high-quality steels for armaments.    Thefourth largest steel plant Is the Mysore Iron and Steel Works whichannually produce about 25,000 tons of light structural shapes end bars.In addition to these four concerns, a number of small allIn operatepartially or wholly on scrap and produce light shapes and bars chieflyfor the bazaar trade.    There are 13 electric furnaces in the country;most of these have a capacity of four-fifths ton, but one has a capacityof 10 tons, and two, of 2 tons each.The Tata Iron and Steel Company, which manufactures a wide variety of steel products, has five well-equipped blast furnaces which, in 1941,produced 1,237,000 tons of pig iron and 29,000 tons of ferromanganese.Of the pig iron produced In that year, 1,015,000 tons were used in themolten state at the foundry and the steel-melting shops.     The remain-ing 222,000 tons were made into pigs which were either sold or consumedat the works.     The production of ferromanganese in 1941 exceeded plantrequirements which are about 12,000 tons a year.     The 40-inch bloomingsill has a capacity of 1,000,000 tons a year, provided it is not re-quired to roll alloy steel ingots;   the maximum tonnage produced by thismill was 953,599 in 1941.    Ia addition, the company has a continuoussheet bar and billet mill with a maximum production of 577,289 tons, asemicontinuous Morgan mill with a mmrlmmg production of 172,344 tons, aplate mill with an annual capacity of 82,000 tons, and sheet milIn withan annual capacity of 160,000 tons of black sheets, averaging 24-gage.The sheet mills contain hot mills, finishing mills, an annealing sec-tion, and a galvanizing section which has an nnminl capacity of 125,000tons of galvanised sheets of 24-gage.     On November 29, 1941, the Tatacompany began the manufacture of railway wheels, tire8, and axles whichare produced from its own acid open-hearth steel.    The company is alsooperating a benzol and toluol plant on behalf of the Government ofIndia.    It has installed two electric furnaces capable of producingabout 1,500 tons of high-quality steel a month, and Is operating aningot mold foundry to increase the output of castings.   In addition, thecompany has extensive repair shops, machine-tool shops,alaboratories,and a technics 1 training school.    The company is producing a largenumber of special steels, including bullet-proof armor plate, for use inthe manufacture of munitions in India.
Production at the Tata Iron and Steel Company is limited by the capacity of its blooming mill which is faking the company&apos;a entireannual output of 1,000,000 tons.    This, however, is inadequate to keepthe secondary mills operating at capacity.     The company is proposing toinstall a new Perrin-prooess plant which will Increase its annual outputof ingots by 200,000 tons;   production will then exceed the bloomingcapacity by at least 100,000 tons.     The company proposes, therefore, toinstall a billeting mill that will relieve the blooming mill and provide adequate steel to keep the production of secondary mlTTs at a saximum.In addition to these projects for plant expansion, the Tata company isplanning, with the aid of the Government of India, to erect three otherplants:   A plant for the manufacture of special alloy steels, with a capacity of 50 tons a month, a plant with a 15-ton furnace for the manu-facture of ferro-alloys, such as ferromolybdenum and ferrotungsten, and additional equipment to enable the mill manufacturing steel plates to operate, on a three-shift basis, at the rate of 10,000 to 12,000 tons amonth.The Steel Corporation of Bengal aleo has a modern and efficientlyequipped plant which includes steel furnaces with an annual capacity of250,000 tons of ingots, and a new Sachs blooming mill with an annualcapacity of 600,000 to 700,000 tons.     Its finishing mills are capableof handling the quantity of steel which could be rolled in the bloomingmill.     The equipment at the Government Metal and Steel Factory atIaha pore and at the Mysore Iron and Steel Works is being modernized andthe capacities of these plants are being expanded.Expansion of production. - Various projects for the expansion of equipment essential to the production of steel are now being consideredby the Government of India and the steel companies concerned.     Theseextensions, for some of which the equipment has already been ordered,include the following:firm Type Annual capacityTonsTata Iron &amp; Steel Perrin plant:&apos;  Acid steel 50,000Basic steel 150,000Steel Corporation of            90-ton open hearth 75,000BengalIshapore (Government) Three 25-ton furnaces:Special steels 25,000Mysore 25-ton furnace:Basic steel 20,000Catmpore 10-ton open hearth 10,000Total 330.000Source:   Bepartment of Supply, Government of India.
The Steel Corporation of Bengal has a new Sache blooming mill withan annual capacity of 600,000 to 700,000 tone of ingota.     Ax, the timeof the Mission1a vialt this mill was being fed by steel furnaces with anannual maximum production of 250,000 tons of ingots.     A project isbeing considered by the Government of Indie and the Corporation to in-creaae the capacity of the melting shop in order that an additional400,000 tons of ingots can be made available to maintain the operationof the blooming mill at capacity.     To secure these additional ingotswithout the erection of blast furnaces, it would be necessary for theCorporation to obtain a substantial amount of pig iron customarilyexported to the United Kingdom.    The Indian Iron and Steel Company hasadequate capacity to feed the new melting furnaces, provided it is re-leased from its contract to supply the United Kingdom with 32,COO tonsof pig iron a month.    The Mission understands that this release hasbeen obtained and that negotiations between officials of the Governmentof India and the Steel Corporation of Bengal are now in progress for theexpansion of the melting shop.Other projects for the expansion of the. production of steel inIndia include the Installation of three 25-ton furnaces for the manufac-ture of special steels in the Government Metal and Steel Factory atIshapore, and the erection of a 25-ton furnace for the production of basic steel by the Mysore Iron and Steel Works.     In addition, there isa 10-ton open-hearth furnace at Cawnpore which, at the time of theMission&apos;s visit, had not been placed in operation.projects to increase the production of iron and steel in India must also include a consideration of transportation facilities and of the availability of adequate supplies of water and power.     The railroads ofIndia are already greatly overburdened by increased traffic arising outof the war and the temporary closing of the port of Calcutta, and by theloss of rolling stock and locomotives sent to the Middle East.     Anysubstantial increase in the production of iron and steel will place an even greater burden on the railroads which cannot cope with existingtraffic.     If an increase in the operations of steel mills is oontem-plated, adequate provisions must be made to move the necessary iron ore and coal to the mills and to move the finished products to their ulti-mate destinations.    With foresight the necessary quantities of watercan probably be obtained, but planning is essential because of the seasonal character of the rains.     Finally, in any substantial programfor the expansion of the industry, provision must be made for the in-crease of existing facilities for the production of power because theprincipal steel companies are already taking the capacities of theirgenerating plants.GoYoruEeut control. - Despite the considerable Increase in theproduction of steel in India, the present supply is inadequate to meet all of the military and essential civilian requirements of the country.Before the war India imported annually about 300,000 tons of stoeljsince the outbreak of the war, these imports have been graatly reduced,amounting in 1941 to only 100,000 tons.     The Government of India be-lieves that India&apos;s minimum import requirements for 1942 are 250,000tons, and that 600,000 tons could be used for war purposes if that amount could be made available.Since August 1941, the distribution of the whole of India1s produc-tioa of steel has been rigidly controlled by a combined licensing andquota system.     The use of tin and of spelter for galvanizing eithercorrugated or plain Bheets is controlled by the Director-General,
HunitionB Production, as are all ferro-alloys.     The steel control hascomplete authority over the transfer of ell available supplies, both   -Imported and domestic.     Exports are prohibited except for essential war purposes, and a strict export licensing system is enforced.     Allapplications for import licenses for steel must be approved by the steel import controller.     Importers are required to provide full ir.-formation concerning the specific use for which the material is in-tended.     In this way the Government of India is able to insure thatsteel is utilised only in the satisfaction of military and essentialcivilian requirements.Recommondati ons.1.   The mission endorsed the projects for the expansionof plant capacity&apos; by the Tata Iron and Steel Company, Ltd.These projects were also approved by the Government of India,and the Mission agreed to vise its influence to securepriorities in the United States adequate to provide for the delivery of the necessary equipment and materials.2.   The Mission approved the projected expansion ofproduction by the Steel Corporation of Bengal and urged thatit be undertaken promptly.     It agreed to use its influence to secure priorities adequate to insure the delivery of equipment and materials which might be ordered in the UnitedStates.    In view of the acute problem of transportationcreated by the closing of the port of Calcutta, the Missionexpressed the opinion that the pig iron formerly exportedunder contract to the United Kingdom could be more usefullyemployed by expanding the production of steel in the plantof the Steel Corporation of Bengal.     The Mission was graf -fied to learn that, prior to its departure from India, tbiBarrangement had been made with the Government of the UnitedKingdom.3.   Inasmuch as all of the steel to be obtained from the planned expansion of productive facilities has already been allocated to war or essential civilian uses, the Missionexpressed the view that any considerable increase in Indus-trial production would require a further expansion of the productive capacity of the steel companies.     The Missiontherefore urged that serious consideration be given to theearly acquisition of additional equipment and materials forthe manufacture of steel.4.   Most of the essential raw materials for the manufac-ture of tool steel are available in India.     A very large%   part of its requirements, however, must be imported.     TheMission recommends, therefore, that a plant for the manufac-ture of tool steel be erected in India.
MunitionsBefore the war India had six ordnance factories devoted to theproduction of munitions.    These were the Metal and Steel Factory atIshapore, the Gun and Shell Factory at CosBipore, the Rifle Factory atIshapore, the Gun Carriage Factory at Jubbulpore, the Cordite factory at Aruvankadn, and the Ammunition Factory at Kirkee.     When the warbegan India was engaged in implementing a plan, recommended by a com-mittee under the chairmanship of Lord Chatfield, which provided for theexpansion and modernisation of these ordnance factories and the eetab-lishment of a seventh plant for the production of high explosives.Most of the recosaendations of that committee were put into operation bythe end of 1941&apos;    In the fall of 1940, a Mission from the BritishMinistry of Supply, under the chairmanship of Sir Alexander Roger,visited India to determine how the Industrial production of that country could best be expended.    The Roger Mission recommended a large numberof projects for the manufacture of munitions, chief among which were theestablishment of factories for the production of (1) Bren guns,(2) shells and mortar bombs, (3) fuses, (4) cartridge cases, (5) ammunl-tion, and (6) scientific instruments.    Most of these projects, as wellas others recommended by that Mission, have been approved by the Govern-ment of India, and work on a number of them has been undertaken.In addition to tbs expansion of existing munitions factories andthe establishment of new ones, the Government of India has found itnecessary to take over four railway workshops which are now beingutilized in the production of war materials.    One of these workshopswas converted into an ordnance factory, a second one is producing muni-tions and armored vehicles, and the other two are being utilised prin-cipally for the production of armored vohiclao.2/   A number of otherrailway workshops are partially engaged in the production of war materials for the Government, and this production is being supplemented by the manufacture of war materials in the workshops of more than 200private concerns.1/ See Beotion on Armored Vehicles ImrnftiHwtely following.ReooBMand^tlccg-ContAatted.5.   The attention of the Missies was called to thequality of steel produced by the electric furnaces in India.   .*V\These furnaces ore not now prod-ioing the high-quality steels   ) jjof which they are capable.    The Mission recommended thatthis situation be rectified as promptly as possible and, inaccordance with the request of the Government of India,agreed to attempt to secure the services of two qualifiedexperts from the United States to assist in this project.6.   In any program for the expansion of the productionof steel in India, the Mission recommends that special atten-ticn be given to the problems of providing adequate suppliesof water and power and of securing the requisite equipment for transporting the raw materials and the finished products.
the ordnance factories actually controlled and operated by theGovernment of India and the factories which that Government expects to erect in the near future are listed below.

184Any large program for the expansion of the production of munitionsin India must take into consideration a number of inherent difficulties.There is an acute shortage of power in most manufacturing areas inIndia.     The Mission believes that this difficulty might be overcome incertain localities by a more judicious system of distribution,l/but isquite aware that in many districts it would be necessary to installadditional generating equipment if productive capacity is to be mate-rially expanded.     A second difficulty is that practically all of the machine-tool and processing equipment and many of the basic raw mate-rials, such as special alloy steels, would have to be imported, andthere is an acute shortage of most of these materials.     Should there be any substantial expansion, additional technical staff would have tobe secured to operate the new plants, and most of the technicians wouldhave to aome from countries other than India.     Kith these limitationsin mind, the Mission urgad that every effort be made to secure themaximum utilization of existing equipment, but did suggest the instal-lation of equipment for a new rifle factory in the vacant building atCawnpore and the erection of a new factory for the manufacture of shellsnot exceeding 6&quot; in size.The Mission understands from offioials of the Government of india that that country will be largely self-supporting in the execution ofits present program for the production of munitions.     Its chief import requirements for the maintenance of the program are listed below.     TheMission is informed that arrangements have been made with the Govern-ment of the United Kingdom to obtain all of these requirements.Quantity per monthNumberFuses for 25-lb. guns 47,000Fuses for antiaircraft ammunition 14,000TonsT.N.T. 150Ammonium nitrate 200Tetryl j Cordite for cannon 250Nitrocellulose powder 55Carbamite AMineral, jelly 11Dimethylaniline 18The program of the Government of India for the production of muni-tions and the actual production record as of March 1942 are shown intable 8.

Rifle Factory (Cawnpore).The factory building was erected with the intention of transfer-ring to it the machinery and equipment from the rifle factory at loha-pore.     The American Technical Mission suggested, however, that newequipment for the manufacture of rifles be installed in the plant atCawnpore in order to increase the number of rifles now being produced in India.

Rooomnendationra.1.   The Mission is of the opinion that the presentprogram for the aanufaoturo of rifles is inadequate to meetthe Amy1 s require sen ta for expansion and replacements.   it therefore renunwinds thaw a new rifle faotory, at leastequivalent In capacity to the present one at Ishapore, beestablished at Campers.     This location appears to be da air-able because a faotory building and adequate power are avail-able there.2.   The Mission recommends the establishment of a plant for the production of shells not to exceed&apos; 6&quot; in size.     Itis the opinion of the Mission that a considerable saving intransportation could be effected if the capacity of thisplant were adequate to care for anticipated needs in theMiddle East and China, as well as in India.3.   The Mission urges the most efficient utilization ofexisting equipment.     It believes that increased productioncan be obtained by Improving the arrangement of machinery inthe various plants and by concentrating in specific plantsthe manufacture of certain types of munitions.    At the re-quest of the Government of India, the Mission agreed toattempt to secure the services of a number of productionengineers from the United States who would advise theGovernment of Indln on these problems.4*   The Mission recommends that every possible effortbe made to achieve promptly the objectives established bythe Government of India for the production of the various types of munitions.5.   The Mission further recommends that, in thoseinstances in which the production of munitions may beretarded by a shortage of power, a rigorous system of priorities be invoiced to curtail its nonessential uses.Armored VehicleaShortly after the outbreak of war. a Tank Development Board was established to design an armored carrier that could be constructed inIndia.     Previously no armored fighting vehicles had been produced there;now it is necessary to import only the chassis on which the armoredbodies are mounted.    The first vehicle to be designed and put into pro-duction was the Mark I Wheeled Carrier based on a standard V-8 Fordchassis, fitted with a special front axle unit, radiator, and gasolinetank.    The body was armored with 6 mm. plate produced in India.Later it was discovered that the Mark I Carrier was restricted inusefulness to general reconnaissance work.     It was therefore decided toproduce an improved type of carrier.    As a result the Mark II Carrierwas developed, with a rear engine Ford chassis having a 101-inch wheelbase and 4-wheel drive.    These chassis are Imported from Canada.    Thearmor on the Mark II body ranges from 14 mm. to A mm. In thickness,depending upon the vulnerability of the points to be protected.
Tha armored vehicles now being produced in India may be dividedinto three classes.    The armored carrier is a wheeled vehicle on aFord ohasnis with an open-type body, the body weight of the armor being ftiabout 2  tons. /   Armored cars are similar in type except that they havva somewhat heavier body, which is closed, with a revolving turretmounted on the top.    The armored general-purpose vehicle is also awheeled vehicle on a Ford chassis, the body being rectangular andcovered with about 2^ tons of armor.jy   These last-named machines are used for the movement of troops and supplies, especially on borderpatrol.The projected maximum production of armored vehicles in India is600 a month, to be composed as follows:Armored cars and carriers 500Armored general-purpose vehlolea 100Total 600It is anticipated that the production of 600 armored vehicles amonth will be realized in July or August 1942.     Three plants are now engaged in the manufacture of these vehicles and each one is scheduledto produce 200 a month.     These plants, which were formerly railway workshops, are located at Singhbhum, Tatanagar, and Kanchxapara.Production of armored vehicles in- India cannot be increased with-out the installation of a new assembly plant and the procurement ofadditional armor plate by importation, or by the expansion of theplate-rolling oapacity of the steel mills.    The present program re-quires the delivery of 1,700 tons of armor plate each month, but eventhat amount cannot be obtained without importing substantial quantities.Tilth existing equipment, India&apos;s capacity to produce armor plate is 750tons a month.     This might be increased to 1,000 tons a month, but only by reducing the production of other plate which is urgently required fordefense purposes, such as ship repairs and the construction of a 50,000-ton dry dock.     Because of this situation, the Mission recommended bycable that the United States furnish to India 1,000 tons of armor platea month. . This amount, requeated by the Government of India, appearsnecessary to maintain India&apos;s present program for the production ofarmored vehicles.Recoiaanndatlona .1.   The Mission recommends that every effort be made toreach and maintain the scheduled production of-600 armoredvehicles a month.     It believes that this schedule can bemaintained more easily after improvements are made in plantorganization and assembly methods.2.   In order to permit the execution of the presentprogram, the Mission has recommended to the Government ofthe United States that it provide through the Lend-LeaseAdministration 1,000 tons of armor plate a month for export to India.1/ As reported to the Mission by officials of the Government of India.
1/ The technical operations are under the control of Mr. W. D. Pawl6y,President of the Inter-Continent Corporation of New York.     Since 1934Er. Pawley has also organized, financed, and&apos;managed the CentralAviution Manufacturing Co. in China.    He also operates two aircraft factories in the United States.AirplaneaIn the latter part of 1940 the Government of India decided to lendits support to the Hindustan Aircraft Company, Ltd., of Bangalore,ISysore State, for the construction of an aircraft factory.     TheGovernment of India now owns a two-thirds interest in the company andthe remainder is owned by the State of Mysore.    For the period of thewar the Government has complete administrative and financial control the factory       This company, which has the only aircraft factory inIndia, employs 29 American supervisors and 3,400 locally trained Indianmechanics.    It has a metal-working and component assembly plant, afoundry machine shop, and an assembly and erection hangar, the totalfloor space of which aggregates 230,000 square feet.    A new hangar foraaInienance with floor space of 25,000 square feet is under oonatruo-tion.     Its airport has two surface runways, one 3,800 feet and theother 5,000 feat in length.     It also has mooring and beaching faoili-ties for seaplanes, and t. nwylnain run of 9,300 feet.The Hindustan Aircraft Company has been manufacturing wooden and metal air-franca components.    With these, and with engines, instru-aonta, and other parts imported from the United States and the UnitedKingdom, the company has been producing finished planes.     At presentthe company has under contract the manufacture of 30 Harlow trainers,24 Vultee bombers, AS Hawk fighters, and 10 training gliders.     by april 1, 1942, three trainers, one fighter, and one glider had been delivered.    The company has also undertaken the manufacture of 60052-gallon drop-tanks for Hawk and Mohawk fighters.     In addition, it isservicing, overhauling, and repairing a substantial number of planesfor the armed services of the United Nations.The Kiasior. understands that officials of the company are anxiousto continue the assembly of planes at the factory in order that thelabor force may be maintained intact.     The Mission finds itself in sympathy with this view but wishes to point out that, as air activity in India is increased, there will be a marked demand for facilities to repair aircraft&apos;.     The Mission is of the opinion that steps should betaken to adjust plant machinery so that the company would be properlyequipped for this important task.     Provision should be made for theoverhaul of engines, the manufacture of certain spare parts (especially those that are bulky, light, and frail), and the maintenance of suppliesof other spare parts.     The Mission believes that it is impossible tooveremphasize the importance of so equipping the company that it may beable quickly to repair the airplanes which have been and are being sentto India by the United Kingdom and the United States.In March 1942, the repair of airplanes ass undertaken on a modest scale by the ordnance factory at Kanclirapam, near Calcutta.     the repair work, however, has been severely handicapped by the absence of equipment and of propellers and other spare parts.
liscaoiaadatlona.1.   The Mission rooo-umls that emphasis be placed onthe repair and maintenance of planes In India rather thanupon their manufacture.2.   It recommends that every effort be bade to obtainthe equipment necessary to expedite the repair of planes at both Bangalore and Kanchrapara, and that adequate supplies of spare parts be maintained at these repair centers.3*   Because of the importance of this work the Mission1b ready to use its influence to obtain for the Government ofIndia the equipment and materials that will be necessary tocarry out these recommendations.Shipbuilding and Ship RepairShipbuilding.The Royal Indian Navy has been increased considerably since theoutbreak of the war.     James Fighting Ships, in 1940, lists five escort vessels, one patrol vessel, one trawler, and one surveyor:   the bookstates that, in addition, a number of merchant vessels have been taken over for service in the Havy.     The Mission understands that the oon-struction program for the Indian Navy includes the following;37 trawlers, 5 corvettes, 8 wooden mine sweepers, 6 Fair-miles (fast &apos;antisubmarine motorboats), 12 light-draught motor launches, 72 feet in length, 2 floating docks, 88 Z craft, 46 skids, 2 Bine-sweeping tugs, aseagoing water-boat, and a number of small motor launches.In 1941 the annual capacity of India&apos;s shipyards was 50,000 grosstens.2/   These shipyards, however, cannot bund large vessels;   specialequipment, including boilers and engines, must be -imported.     They doproduce a variety of small craft;   in October 1941 they were fullyengaged in the production of about 200 vessels of various sizes.Recently, the construction of a shipyard was undarcaken at Vizagapatamwhich will have a maximum capacity of 8,000 tons when the plant andequipment, on order from the United Kingdom, are delivered.    Exceptfor this yard and these at Calcutta and Bombay, the shipyards of India,because of size and equipment, are confined chiefly to the constructionof wooden vessels.     The port of Cochin, for example, has one yardequipped to construct wooden ships 110 feet in length and a firm atKarachi can produce such ships 72 feet in length.     In addition, thereare a number of small beat-building firms located in the Cutoh,Kathiawar, and Malabar ports.Of the ships now being produced in India, the corvettes, with alength of 180 feet, and the Ban gore, with a length of 171 feet, 6 inches,are the largest.    The latter has a displacement of 689 tons and a speed of 16 knots.    Other classes Include the Basset Trawlers which have alength of 150 feet and a speed of 12 knots, fair miles, 72-foot motorlaunches, motor mine sweepers, tugs, lifeboats, skids, and tank-landing craft.     The principal types and numbers of ships under construction inIndia in March 1942, and the locations in which they are being oon-8trueted, are shown in table 9*1/ Source:   U. S.

Moreover, this repair work, which would customarilybe distributed among the ports now in possession of the enemy, has beenaugmented by enemy action, and is now concentrated in the west-coast ports of India because of the operations of the Japanese fleet In the bay of Bengal.    Among the west-coast ports only Bombay has appreciablefacilities for the repair of ships.     In consequence, temporary repairs,sufficient to enable damaged ships to proceed to ports outside of India,ere all that is possible in many instances.-     van this task is a severe strain upon the available facilities.!/  The only naval dockyardin India is that of the Royal Indian Navy at Bombay.     The facilities atthis dockyard are limited, and, should the necessity for repairs andthe maintenance of naval vessels of the United Nations be increased, itis likely that such work would encroach on the limited facilities avail-able for merchant ships.     The Mission believes it to be of the utmosturgency that existing repair facilities of the west-coast ports shouldbe utilized to the maximum and that such facilities should be expandedas rapidly as possible.A summary of the repair facilities of the principal ports of india is given below:1.   Calcutta. - The port of Calcutta is probably the best equippedin India for the repair of ships, although it is short of berthingaccommodations for such work.     It has one large tandem dry dock andthree smaller drydocks.    There are three maior^/and several minorfirms engaged in the repairing of vessels.&apos;1/ For a previous reference to this subject, see section entitled&quot;Ports.&quot;2/ These three companies are the Garden Reach, the Shallmar, and theHooghly Dock Co.
2.   Ylzaftu-Tatam. - ThlB port hae a sma.11 natural harbor.     Facili-.ties for iihip repairing are inadequate but a new shipbuilding yard ianow under construction there.     Assuming the deli-very of the requisiteplant and materials from the United Kingdom, it could be made suitablefor the repair of ships within a few months.     The Port Trust 1b nowable to undertake minor repairs and the docking of small craft.   &apos;3.   Madras. - The harbor at Muctras is artificial and facilitieswill permit only above-water and limited major repairs.     It has nodry dock but does have a eaail-craft sllp*ay.     Repairs are ^stomarilyundertaken by either the Port Trust or a prlvato concem^L/and theseare sometimes assisted by smaller concerns and a railway workshop.4.   Karachi. - repair facilities in the natural harbor of Karachicould be expanded to relieve congestion at Bombay.     Tnis port, bow-ever, has one smlII dry dock which is capable of handling only harborcraft.     Three major firms are engaged in the business of ship ropair-ing.2/5o   Bombay. - Bombay has a large natural harbor.    There is, flow-ever, an acute shortage of berthage for ship repair.     The port has one large tandem dry dock and three smaller docks.     It also has a slipwayfor small vessels.     The repairing of vessels is chiefly in the handsof three private concerns and the Royal Indian Navy Dockyard.2/Cochin. - The natural harbor of Cochin has limited facilitiesfor repairing ships.     There is only one small dry dock for harborcraft, and additional berths for repairs are urgently required.     More-over, the port is deficient in facilities for the watering and fuelingof ships.     The repair work is carried on chiefly by the Port Trust anda private concern, both of-which are handicapped by the lack of adequateequipment^/Recoiaaendati ens.1.   the idsaion recommends that existing facilities forthe repair of ships at west-coa6t ports should be fullyutilized.2.   To achieve this objective, it recommends the con-tinuous operation of these facilities in three 8-hour shiftsand the discontinuance of shipbuilding and all other censtruc-tion that might interfere with the work of repair.3.   The Hission recommends the expansion of facilitiesfor the repair of ships in west-coast ports by the transferof light, movable equipment from east-coast ports and by theimportation of equipment from the United Kingdom and theUnited States.     In this connection the Mission has given itsendorsement to a list of equipment required by the port of bombay and stands ready to endorse similar orders for otherwest-coast ports, including Karachi and Cochin.1/ The private company is known as Binny &amp; Co.2/ These firms are Herman &amp; Mohatta, Ltd., the Karachi EngineerjxigWorks and Foundry, and the Dock Engineering and Welding Works.2/ These private concerns are Uazagon Dook Co., Alcock &amp; Ashdown, andthe Indian Steam Navigation Co.y The private concern is Brunton &amp; Co.
1Wherever possible, it urge6 the utilization of addl-tional repair berths and the location of buoys for mooringships close to repair shops so that work might be diverted from the docks to the stream.5.   The Mission is fully aware of the importance of shipconstruction to the Royal Indian Navy and to the cause of theunited Nations.     It recommends, therefore, the continuance at East-coast ports of the program of ship construction, providedthat adequate materials can be Bade available without retard-in g other more essential projects.Industrial production the Mission, in its visits to industrial plants throughout India,had an opportunity to observe operations in privately owned factories and those owned by the Government.     Based on its observations, theMission believes that it will be possible to attain a substantial in-crease in the production of many articles essential to the prosecution of the war by an improvement in plant and industrial organization.     Ina number of plants productive efforts were less effective than theynight otherwise be because many different articles were being producedsimultaneously.     This practice, which is apparently quite general inIndia, prevents the application of mass-production methods and retardsproduction by making it difficult, if not impossible, to segregate into their simplest components the tasks to be performed.     Frequently pro-duction was further retarded by the inefficient placement of machinery and by the excessive handling of articles arising out of such placement,provision for adequate light and air and the installation of cementfloors in some plantB would operate to increase the speed and accuracy of production, and to protect valuable machinery.The Mission observed that, in some cases, identical articles werebeing produced on a &quot;&quot;&quot;it scale in several different plants.     In suchinstances the advantages of mass production were lost and production wassmaller and more costly than it should have been.     In other cases, thellibsion observed that, because of the lack of essential machinery, itwas necessary to move goods to a second plant for partial processingand later to return such goods to the original plant for finishing.Obviously a relocation of machinery would reduce the tine of manufacture and the cost of handling.     If it were possible to concentrate produc-tloa in a few rather than in many plants, and if the machinery essentialto any single productive process could be located within the plantprimarily devoted to such production, the existing industrial equipment in India could be utilized more efficiently and effectively than atpresent.Machine tools.Another factor affecting India&apos;s production of war materials ia the acute shortage of machine tools.     Before the war India&apos;s capacity forthe manufacture of such tools was very small, being limited to simplelathes and drilling and shaping machines.     A more efficient utilizationof existing facilities, particularly in the railway workshops, has en-ibled India in recent months to increase, the volume and types of machineRacosnepdatione-Continued.
tools produced there.     The range of production has been extended to in-olude presses, cold saws, thread killers, tool grinders, blotters,planes, furnaces, blowers, blasting equipment, and rolling mills.Despite this expansion in production, the machine-tool industry in india is not large and is unable to meet minim requirements.     Domestic pro-due ti on, therefore, must be supplemented by imports from the UnitedKingdom and the United States.All requests from India for machine tools are routed through the machine Tool Control in London.     This Control attempts to meet India&apos;erequests from its own resources or by diverting to India some of the Lend-lease allotments to the United Kingdom.    Requests that cannot be filled in this way are handled by the Indian purchasing Mission in washington which places direct requisitions upon the Land-Lease Adninis-tration.     The dependence of India upon the United States for machine tools is indicated by the increase in the number of such tools beingrequisitioned by the Indian Purchasing Mission.    Several.recentrequisitions have received the endorsement of the Mission.The records of the Machine Tool Control for recent months showthat, for the expansion of the war effort, India&apos;a current miniumrequirements are approximately 9,000 machine tools per annum, of which about 4,000 are required by the Government and 5,000 by other war and essential industries.     The Government of India proposes to meet these requirements as follows!1942 1943Tools to be manufactured in India 3,360 4,600Tools to be requisitioned andreconditioned in India . 2,310Tools to be imported 3.330 4.400Total 9,000 9.000These estimates, however, do not Include 3,171 machine tools already on order for sanctioned projects for the production of munitions, 453machine tools for the manufacture of small tools, forged tools, and engineering stores, and 111 machine tools for the expansion of produc-tion in existing plants.     Moreover, they do not include any allowance for ordinary replacements of machine tools which, based on an expectedlife of 20 years, would amount to about 4,000 tools a year.     Importsof required machine tools into India should amount to about 3,330 in1942 and to 4,400 in 1943j   in addition, there would be the 3,735machine tools on order for specific projects and the 4,000 machine toolsthat are required for ordinary replacements.    with the completion ofthe program of industrial expansion, it may be assumed that India willbe able to provide the machine tools necessary for ordinary replacementsand that only the more intricate type of tools will have to be Imported.But, In order that the program of expansion may be completed, it isessential that India&apos;s requirements for machine tools (as indicated above) should be met.The Government of India established a strict machine-tool control under a Deputy Director-General early in 1941.     The Director has powerto supervise completely the production and distribution in India of allmachine tools.    He is empowered to license imports and exports.     Hecan prevent the diversion of essential machines to nonessential purposes and can requisition machines required by factories engaged in the pro-due tion of munitions.    In addition, he has the power to determine the type and quantity of machine teds to be manufactured in the country,
and the factories at union such aeimfacturo is to be undertaken,   &quot;theGovernment of India ie thua able to control completely the manufacture,distribution, and use of machine tools within its own borders.Small tools.Despite the progress made in the production of small tools, Indiamust continue to Import substantial quantities of saws, files, precisionmeasuring tools, and cemented carbide cutting tools.    The capacity inIndia to produce high-speed, carbon-steel twist drills, mining cutters,and reamers is inadequate to fill the essential demand.     As a resultone plant, with an annual capacity of AGO,000 drills, has been taken over by the Government, and plans have been completed to quadruple its capacity.    Orders for necessary equipment have been placed with theUnited Kingdom and with local manufacturers.    The capacity in Tt&quot;^1&quot; toproduce high-speed, carbon-steel taps, dies, and thread-forming tools isalso inadequate.     A project is therefore being considered for the g.e.e-tion of a factory to manufacture these tools, with an estimated nnnunloutput of 300,000.     The equipment will be ordered in part from theUnited Kingdom and in part from local manufacturers.     The Government ofIndia indicated that it would look to the United States for the supplyof tool atoel necessary to maintain the production of these plants;this would amount annually to about 120 tons.The Agrico Works of the Tata Iron and Steel Company proauces pick-axes, felling axes, and other hand tools.     It has an w*nniwi capacity ofapproximately 2,000,000 such tools, and a project sponsored by theGovernment of India is under way to double that capacity.    Orders fox-three Bliss Pick-Eye Presses and one Felling Axe Eye Punching Press havebeen placed on the Lend-Lease Administration by the Indian PurchasingMission.     Other essential equipment will be obtained in India.The Government of India has instituted a rigid control over theimportation, exportation, and distribution within India of all types ofsmall tools.    All tools ordered for India, therefore, whether by theGovernment or by private concerns, are required for the production ofmunitions or other essential war materials, and will be devoted exnlu-sively to such purposes.Other steel manufactures.The production of machinery and machine tools in Tit^h is retardedby the absence of equipment for the manufacture of certain essentialparts, such as roller and ball bearings.     A plant for their manufacturewould facilitate the production of various types of machinery.    More-over, a plant or plants completely equipped for die casting wouldexpedite the production of shells and components of munitions as well as of other war materials.     A factory for the production of pipes andtubing would effect a saving in both time and shipping space;   it wouldalso expedite essential construction and the repair of locomotives.The existence of such a plant would be a particularly Important factor in any project for the construction of a pipe line for the transporta-tion and distribution of gasoline in India.    There are a number of wiredrawing pi ants in India, but there is no plant for the manufacture ofwire screen.     this product would have many war uses, particularly in hospitals and barracks, and would doubtless find a large civilian market in the post-war period.
With the proper equipment, the manufacture of scientific instru-ments could be undertaken in India on a much wider scale than atpresent.    These Instruments would have a number of immediate war usesand are essential in any program for the expansion of Industrial production-tioa...     Small electric motors not exceeding 5 horsepower would also be useful instruments in such a program.    By attaching these motors to individual machines, the current use of shaft and belt drive could bereduced with a corresponding saving in the consumption of electricenergy.    Small motors could be produced in India which affords most ofthe essential raw materials, with the possible exception of copper.Assembly of motor vehicles.The assembly of motor vehicles is a substantial industry in Indiaand is now operating almost exclusively under contracts with the Govern-ment.     The assembly plants are owned and oparrt^d by two United states companies, General Motors and Ford.    Their maximum annual capacity is approximately 96,000 units, of which General Motors can assemble 60,000and Ford, 36,000.    The assembly plant of General Motors is located in bombay.     The Ford Company has three plants;   the plant in Bombay hasan annual capacity of approximately 21,000 units, the one in Calcutta,9,000 units, and the third ia Madras, 6,000 units.    All four plantsare well-managed and efficiently operated.The current annual requirements of the Government of India areapproximately 84,000 vehicles.     Of this number, it is expected thatGeneral Motors will assemble 50,000 units and Ford, 34,000.     TheMission was informed by Government officials that the capacity for theconstruction of bodies within India is adequate to meet the require-ments of the Government.     Inasmuch.as the capacity for the assembly ofchassis is also adequate, there appears to be no need for expansion inthis field.In order to avoid delays and to permit the most efficient utiliza-tion of existing plant capacity, however, the companies concerned should, insofar as possible, provide for the regular shipments of partsfrom Canada to India.     Because such shipments are made in CKD pack,efforts should be made to insure the inclusion of all essential parts ineach shipment.    The possibility of delay in the assembly of manyvehicles would be further reduced if each CKD pack were limited to no more than 24 units.    Moreover, because vital parts have occasionallybeen omitted in packing, the companies may wish to consider the advis-ability of stocking in India those spare parts which experience hasshown are most likely to be overlooked.Cement.India has 22 plants for the manufacture of cement;   these areowned and operated by 7 companies, and have wnnunl capacities of about,600,000 tons.!/   One company owns 12 of the 22 plants and accounts for about 60 percent of their total productive capacity.    The rawmaterials for the manufacture of cement are all available in India.1/ Two of the 22 plants have not yet been completed;   combinedcapacities of the two uncompleted plants will amount to 75,000 tons annually.
Approximately 90 peroant of tha current production of aement inIndia, is oontraotod for by the Government, aa compared with about 50percent in 1941 and 15 percent in 1940.    Reserve stocks are beingdepleted, inasmuch aa current production is not keeping pace with thedemand.    Moreover, it appears likely that the requirements of theGovernment will increase rather than diminish.    Indeed, the industryexpressed conoern over its ability to meet possible future demands ofthe Government, and has stated its desire to expend plant facilities in order that it might be better prepared to met future contingencies.The Mission called the attention of the Government of India to these representations and indicated its willingness to assist in obtaining the equipment required by the industry, provided the Governmentapproved the orders submitted to it.Radios.Although radios are serviced in India, no sets are assembled oxconstructed there.    The Mission, however, examined the possibility&apos; oxproducing&apos;radio sets in India.     After ocaforenoesi with the trade,with officials of the Government of India, and with technicians in theArmy, the Mission concluded that special types of radios should con-tinus to be imported.    One general-purpose radio set is required inconsiderable numbers (approximately 5,000 annually) for use in armoredoars, airplanes, and in the field operations of the Army.    These, theMission believed, could be Manufactured in part, and assembled, inIndia.    It was the concensus that the purely mechanical parts of theset could be produced locally, but that the electrical componentsshould be imported, although the electrical cables required could beobtained in India.    Such an arrangement would substantially reduce the weight of materials to be imported and thus conserve shipping spade.It would also provide a centrally located supply base and repair depotfor Amy divisions operating in South Africa, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, and china.    The Government of India, at the suggestion of the Mission,appointed a full-time officer to study the project and to formulatedefinite recommendations concerning the manufacture of parts and theassembly of this all-purpose radio set in India.Recommendations.1.   The Mission recommends that a serious effort bemade to obtain the Maximum utilisation of existing plant andequipment through the application of maas-produotion,assembly-line methods.    It suggests that the production ofone or, at.most, of a few articles be concentrated within asingle plant and that, when necessary to achieve this objoo-tive, machinery be transferred from one plant to another.It suggests, also, that production might be increased by improving the arrangement of machinery within individualplants and by waking adequate provision for necessary light and air.2.   At the request of the Government of India theMission agreed to attempt to obtain the services of severalproduction engineers who might advise that Government con-corning the methods most likely to result in the achieve-aent of the objectives outlined above.
3.   The ids a ion approved the plans of the Government ofIndia for the expansion of the production of machine tools.It agreed to attempt to obtain drawings and blueprints of machine tools in the United State a that might serve to aeaistin that production program.     It endorsed a number of ordersfor machine tools placed on the Lend-Lease Administrationthrough the Machine Tool Control in London and the IndianPurchasing Mission in Washington.     And it urges that serious consideration be given to the erection of a factory for the exclusive production of machine tools in order to curtailimport requirements as currently estimated.4.   The Mission endorsed the program of the Governmentof India for the expansion of the production of high-speed,carbon-steel tools and also endorsed the orders for materials and equipment placed on the Lend-Lease Administration by thatGovernment.5.   The Mission recommends that serious consideration begiven to the establishment of plants for the manufacture inIndia of the following articlec, all of which are important in the war effort as a part of a program for industrial expansion:   Roller and ball bearings, pipes and tubing, diecastings, wire screen, scientific instruments, and smallelectric motors.    Should the Government of India give favor-able consideration to these projects, the Mission is ready toassist in. securing the equipment and materials essential totheir implementation.6.   The Mission recommends the manufacture of parts andthe assembly of an all-purpose radio set in India, and it is ready to assist the Government of India in securing from theUnited States the materials and equipment that would berequired for this purpose.Hoaferr cms MetalsThe Government of India maintains a complete control over bothimports and exports of all nonferrous metals.    Exports are permitted to go only to the. united Rations and only for essential purposes.    Thedistribution within India of aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, tin, andsine is under the control of the Government.Bauxite and aluminium.Bauxite. - There are substantial deposits of bauxite in India.Reserves are estimated at about 250,000,000 tons and are located prin-oipally in Bihar, the Central Provinces, and Bombay.    There are also ^small deposits in Madras.    The better grades of bauxite have an averagealumina content of 55 percent.     One of the deposits in the Province of bombay (Tungar Hill, only 30 miles from the city of Bombay), is esti-mated to contain 750,000 tons of bauxite with an average alumina content of 49 percent.     Thus far there has been little mining of bauxite inIndia, and no aluminium has been made in India from Indian bauxite.Exports have been small and sporadic, being largely trial shipments.Recommendations-C continued.
191Because of the grant demand for aluminium arising out of the war, plans have been made to develop the Indian deposits.     Two companies in india have undertaken projects for the eanufaoture of aluminium from Indianbauxite.AMim1&quot;1-- - The Unmlnlnm Production Company of India, Ltd., isestablishing a smelter at Always in Travanoore State which, it isanticipated, will be in operation by August or September 1942*    Thissmelter will have an annual capacity of 2,825 long tons of ingots.The plant, however, is so designed that its capacity^ exclusive of requirements for power, can be increased to 5,850 long tons by the installation of vary little additional equipment, chiefly equipment for melting pots and the rectifier plant.Sometime ago the Aluminium Production Company entered into a con-tract with the Government of Travaneore State for its electric power.Travanoore State, however, was unable to aecurs the hydroelectricequipment necessary to expand its production and now states that itwill be unable to supply sufficient power to operate the smelter ateven its initial capacity.     unless additional power can be obtained,the probable output of the smelter will be 1,750 long tons, rather than2,825 long tons.     The office of the Electrical Commissioner has sug-gested that the power required can be provided by connecting theTravancore State system with the hydroelectric system of the Governmentof Madras.     This could be done by erecting a transmission line betweenthe pallivasal power station and Udmalpet, a switching station of the transmission system of the Madras Government - a distance of about 45miles.     This plan would provide sufficient power to enable the smelterto operate at least at its initial capacity.The Aluminium Production Company is planning to establish a plant for the production of alumina from Indian bauxite which it expects toobtain from nearby deposits in Madras.     This plant, however, may notmaterialize for some time, although the Government of India is anxious that it be established as soon as possible, inasmuch as the company isnow depending upon alumina imported from Canada.     The company has con-ducted surveys of many bauxite deposits in southern India and hasobtained options on some of them.The Aluminium Production Company is a Canadian-British concerninto which it is intended to Introduce substantial Tpd-inn capital andrepresentation after the plant is in operation.    At present AluminiumLtd. of Canada and the British Aluminium Company each have a 50-percentinterest in the Indian organisation, but the control is in the hands sfthe Canadian company.    The Indian concern has a controlling interestin another Indian company, the Jeewanlal Ltd., which is by far thelargest producer of aluminium utensils and other hollowware in India.a second company, the Aluminium Corporation of India, Ltd., wasorganized in 1938 for the production of aluminium from Indian bauxite.It is the Intention of the organizers to establish a complete plant,including the production of alumina, aluminium,&apos; and sheet at Anupnagar,near Asansol, in Bengal.    It is planned to operate the plant withsteam-generated power.     Orders were placed for the entire plant withSkoda at most favorable prices.    At the outbreak of the war about two-thirds of the necessary equipment had been delivered;   undeliveredequipment, however, included the three main D.C. generators to supplypower for the smelter.     Delays in obtaining the essential plant havebeen experienced, In part because of numerous changes of ownership.
Ordsri were finally placed In March 1941, and ahipsoent free the UnitedKingdom la scheduled for July 1942.     Construction of the plant is proceeding and the production of alanina may be possible by the Middleof 1942.    It is doubtful, however, that ingots will be produced beforethe end of 1942, even though the generating plant should arrive as nowscheduled.    The trwi*al capacity of the smelter at Inupnagar is about,000 long tons of ingots.Various attempts hare been made to bring about a merger of the twoproducing companies, but thus far these efforts have been unsuccessful,largely because of disputes between the Canadian-British and IndianInterests over the question of control.    Inasmuch as one company sillsoon have a smelter but will be forced to import alumina, and the otherwill have a plant for the production of alumina but no smelter, itseems obvious that a merger, or at least a working .agreement, could beeffected that would be mutually advantageous.     It would also appearthat the Government of India might use its influence to bring about suchan agreement in order to save the shipping space that would be requiredto import alumina from Canada.Chroaite.There are deposits of chroaite, the oxide of chromium and iron, inBihar, the Eastern States, Bombay, and Mysore, but 95 percent of thechronite produced in India cones from northeastern Baluchistan.     Fromthe mines the ore is transported by narrow-gage railway 46 miles toKhanai, and from there by broad-gage railway 570 wiles to Karachi.There is a large dump at Khanai and there are storage facilities for20,000 tons of ore at Karachi.    The industry in Baluchistan is con-trolled by the Baluchistan Chrome Company with headquarters in London.The production of ohromite in India and exports of the ore fromthat country in recent years are shown in table 10.Table 10. - Chroaitoi   Production in, and exports from,India, 1937-40_(m long tons)_Tear Production Exports1 t1937   -: 62,307 1 50,3671938 -:-: U,-u10 1 24,4521939 -:-2 49,136 j 37,8261940--1 55,511 1 42,704_5_5_Source;   Department of Supply, Government of India.The statistics in table 10 suggest that there is an annual consumption-tion of about 12,000 tons of ohromite in India.    This material is devoted principally to the preparation of furnace refractories;   small,amounts are also used in the manufacture of heavy chemicals.    There are adequate quantities of ore for the production in India of various ohromealleys, ouch as ferrocaroma and -chrome steels.
Although it la apparent from old workings that substantial amount!&apos; copper were once wined in India, commercial operations are now con-booted in only two places.     The more important of these locations isthe Singhbhum copper belt in Bihar, where reserves of ore are estimated to be approximately 850,000 short tons yielding 2.38 percent copper;there is also a very anal] production of copper in Mysore.     In recentyears the annual output of refined copper has been about 6,600 tons which is approximately the capacity of the only copper smelter inIndia-     This smelter is located at Maubhander, in the Singhbhum dis-district of Bihar.Copper ore from the Singh bhua district is nickeliferous, and therefined metal contains as much as one-half percent nickel.     Thequality of Indian copper is adequate for most alloying purposes, but its value as a conductor of electricity is nullified by its nickelcontent.     There is little likelihood in the near future of subatan-tially increasing the pioduotion of copper in India.     That country,therefore, will be foroed to depend on imports of blister copper from rhodesia for its requirements of ordinary copper, and on the UnitedStates or Canada for eleotrolytio copper.    The only alternative wouldbe the installation of an electrolytic smelter for the processing ofblister copper from Rhodesia.Lead and zinc.Lead and zinc ores are known to occur in Rajputana and Kashmir,but there is no production of lead and zinc in India.     The requlre-nents of that country, therefore, must be met by imports.    Since theconquest of Burma, stocks of lead and zinc in India have been rapidlydiminishing.     In a few months there is likely to be a serious shortageof both these metals, and imports from the United States may have to beprovided.     Imports of lead and zinc into India in recent years are shown in table 11.Table 11. - Lead and sine:   Imports into India, 1938-40(In long tons)TearLeadZinc1938&apos; -1939 -1940 -7,5009,50015,00022,00024,00026,500Source:   Deportment of Supply, Government of India.The most promising deposits of load-sine ore in India are the oldnines of Zawar in Udaipur State, Raj pa tana.     The Government of india is planning to develop these deposits which have not been worked for about 100 years because, at that time, mining operations were dis-continued when the water level was reached.     The extent of the depositsIb not known, but samples indicate an ore of excellent quality, averaging-ing 28 percent zinc and 20 percent lead, with 40 ounces of silver to theton.    Moreover, because of the character of the rock, little timberingwill be required.

India, therefore, must continue to import tin to meet its requirements which, in the past,amounted to approximately 3,000 tons a year.    By the elimination of most civilian uses, and the curtailment of military uses, it is pos-slble that essential requirements may be reduced below past consumption.Before operations on these deposits can be resumed, it will benecessary to determine the extent of the ore body and to puap out and otherwise rehabilitate the mines.     It is estimated that about 12months will be required to put the mines in working order.    Moreover,equipment for a flotation mill and for lead and zinc smelters will haveto be Imported and installed.    In addition, considerable technical assistance will be required in the installation and operation of the mill end smelters, and in the manufacture of retorts for the -zincsmelter.     Because of the richness of the ore, however, it would appeardesirable to develop these properties, provided the proposed investiga-tion establishes the existence of adequate reserves.Manganese ore.India customarily accounts for about 30 percent of the world&apos;output of manganese ore.     Production in India amounted to 1,051,000tons in 1937 and to 869,000 tons In 1940, most of which was exported.Formerly, exports went to the United Kingdom, Japan, and France;   nowthey are shipped almost entirely to the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates.     The iron and steel industry in India consumes about 60,000tons annually.     The chief mining areas are the Balaghat, Bhandara, andHagpur districts of the Central provinces;   others include Sandur (oneof the Madras States), Keonjhar and Bonal among the Eastern States,Singhbhum in Bihar, the North Kanara and Panoh Mahals districts of bombay, and Mysore State.     Prior to the closing of the Bay of Bengal,manganese was exported chiefly from Visagapatam which is about 400miles, via the Bengal Hagpur Railway, from the producing centers in theCentral Provinoes.    Currently, the principal port of export is Bombay,production and exports of manganese ore, and the production of ferro-manganese, in India, for the years 1937-40, are shown in table 12.Table 12. - Production and exports of manganese ore, and production of ferromanganese, in India, 1937-40
Titanium..Titanium occurs In India in the form of a double oxide of iron andtanium, known aa ilmenite.     The oxide la used principally in the pig-(    jit industry;   small amounts are also consumed in the manufacture ofsteel.     In recent years most of the world1 s supply of ilmetute has oomefrom TraTancore State in southern India;   there it occurs in the seaBand which also contains monazite and zircon sands.

At the water line the sands are renewed eachyear by wave action.     Most of the ilmenite produced in India is ex-ported, and most of the exports are shipped to the United States.

It further recommends that a plant for the productionof alumina from bauxite be erected at Always with a capacityadequate to provide for the expanded smelter.4.   The Mission is ready to assist the Government ofIndia in obtaining the materials necessary for the erection ofthe proposed transmission line and for the expansion of the capacity of the plant now under construction at Always fay the aluminium Production Company.5.

The Mission suggests that this possibility might be the subject of an investigation by theGovernment of India.7.   The Mission recommends that India&apos;e requirements forcopper continue to be supplied by Rhodesia, Canada, and theUnited States, inasmuch as there is a shortage of power inIndia and little saving in shipping would be effected even ifthe machinery necessary for an electrolytic smelter were madeavailable.3.   The Mission recommends an immediate survey of theold mines of Zawar in Udaipur State, Rajputana.9.   Should the reserves prove adequate, the Missionrecommends that the mines be rehabilitated and that thenecessary equipment for the mining and smelting of lead andzinc be acquired and installed.10.   The Mission is ready to assist the Government ofIndia in obtaining the equipment and material escential forthe execution of this project.Other Strategic ProductsMica.India accounts for about three-fourths of the world&apos;s supply ofsheet and block mica.     Deposits of mica are widely distributedthroughout the country, but it is estimated that nearly 80 percent ofthe total is obtained from Bihar and most of the remainder from theNellore district of Madras. -   Deposits of mica are also found in Raj-putana, Mysore, Gwalior, and Travanoore.    Phlogopite is found inTravanoorej   the other deposits are muscovite.    Workers in mica,chiefly women, have a special skill in dressing and splitting the mineral, and this is an important factor in the preeminence of theIndian industry.     Indeed, block mica from other countries is oftenimported into India and then exported in the form of fine splittingsno more than one one-thousandth of on inch in thickness.    Mo addi-tional capital or equipment is required to increase production whichresponds directly to the stimulus of price.    Production in 1942 laestimated at 22,000,000 pounds, and officials of the Government ofIndia state that this could be increased to 25,000,000 pounds in 1943,if orders were placed sufficiently far in advance to permit the neces-sary scheduling of operations.    Exports of mica from India go chieflyto the United States and the United Kingdom, and these are shown forrecent years in table 14*

Supply, Government of India.Rubber.In recent years India has produced annually about 16,000 tons of crude rubber J*   It is anticipated that by 1943 the annual production of crude rubber will be Increased to 18,000 tons, and that the output ofreclaimed rubber will be established to yield 5,000 tons, thus givingIndia a total annual production of 23,000 tons.    Machinery for themanufacture of reclaimed rubber, however, must be Imported and installed,inasmuch as there is now no such equipment in India.    Crude rubber is produced in southern India in the Malabar district of Madras and innortheastern India in Assam.The current Indian requirements for rubber are estimated by offi-eiale of the Government to be 32,610 toss.    If India is to be self-sufficient in rubber products, it must secure 9,610 tons of crude rubberor its equivalent from sources outside the country.    It has been esti-mated that as much as 25 percent of total requirements may consist ofreclaimed rubber / the deficiency in India, therefore, could be met by imports of crude rubber from Ceylon and of reclaimed rubber from theUnited States, as follows:TonsCrude rubber from Ceylon 6,460Reclaimed rubber from theUnited States 3,150Total 9,610There are two plants for the manufacture of rubber tires in India;one is owned and operated by the Dunlop Company of the United Kingdom,and the other, by the Firestone Company of the United states.    In 1941the capacity of the Dunlop plant was expanded appreciably, and orders have been placed for additional equipment for the Firestone plant.    Itis anticipated that this equipment will be Installed and in operation byHovember 1942.    At that time these two plants will have approximately equal capacities for the manufacture of tires and other rubber goods.The present capacity of plants for the production of rubber goods inIndia, the expanded capacity of these plants with the installation ofmachinery now on order, and the further expansion proposed by the Govorn-ment of India are shown in table 15.1/ This does not include the production of crude rubber in Ceylon, theBptii-jwi output of which is reported to be approximately 100,000 tons.2/ 25 percent of total requirements (32,610 tons) is 8,150 tons, fromwhich must be deducted the 5,000 tons of reclaimed rubber that it isanticipated will be produced in India in 1943.Table 14. - Mioai   Exports from India, 1937-40

Small quanti-ties have been supplied by the United Kingdom.     The estimated imports into Jr\rl&apos;.K of various rubber goods for the 12 months ending June 30,1943, together with the sources of such imports, are listed below interms of rubber content:Long toneFrom Canada:Tires 7,560From the United States:Tires 2,800General rubber goods 100From the United Kingdom:Aero tires and original equip-ment on vehicles 300General rubber goods 300Total 11,060&quot;&quot;According to the estimates it would appear that imports in the currentfiscal year will be approximately equal to the deficiency in rubber ascalculated by government officials.The Government of India exercises a strict control over rubber.It regulates by license both exports and imports:   it allocates thesupply and controls the purchases and sales of raw rubber.   &apos; Stocks inthe hands of estates, dealers, and factories are required to be report-ed monthly.     All sales or transfers of rubber to manufacturers are prohibited except by permit, and consequently the manufacture of rubberfor anything but authorized requirements is prevented.     Since June 15,1942, automobile tires have been strictly rationed.    The purchase ofnew tires or tubes has been restricted to operators of vehicles whichare essential for the maintenance of war-production or for the health or safety of the community.    Permits are required for the retreadingof tires.Table 15. - Rubber:   Current and proposed plant oapaoities in India!/
195Shellao.India is the. world1 a largest producer of lac, a resinous aubstanoeaeareted by a scale Inaeot living on the twigs of trees.     Productionin India la centered In the northern part of the country, and rangesfrom 40,000 to 50,000 tons of raw lao a year, most of which Is export-ed.    Cultivation is distributed extensively in saall holdings.    by far the principal market is the united States where it is used cheifly the production of varnishes and lacquers.     Should India develop asubstantial industry for the manufacture of paint, it is possible that increased quantities of lac would be used locally.    An increase in thequantity of lao gathered or in its production; however, does not appearnecessary.     The chief problem is that of securing adequate transportfi-tion to the United States.RacoKfwnrintions.1.   While in India, the Mission recommended that theUnited States and the United Kingdom purchase jointly their requirements of mica.    It is gratified to note that this  commendation was favorably received and that a JointPurchasing Mission has been established.2.   The Mission recommends that the orders of theUnited States and the United Kingdom for mica be placed asfar in advance as possible, in order that the industry mayadequately schedule its production program and provide forthe continuous employment of the workers.3.   The Mission believes that considerable saving in shipping could be effected by providing for the self-sufficiency of India in the production of most rubber prod-uo+.8, particularly tires.     Such a development would alsoreduce the hazard of shipping crude material to the UnitedStates or Canada and of reshipping the finished product toIndia.     Moreover, the armed forces in India could probablybe supplied more effectively by a local industry than by imports because of the frequent delay in the movement ofships.4.   For these reasons, the Mission recommends that the combined Raw Materials Board allocate to India the amount of crude and reclaimed rubber necessary to make that countryself-sufficient in the production of rubber products.5*   If the Board acts favorably upon this recommendation,the Mission recommends that the necessary equipment andmaterial be acquired for the expansion of plant capacities.6. The Mission, also recommends that the necessary equip-ment and materials be acquired for a plant to produce annually5,000 tons of reclaimed rubber.7.   The Mission further recommends the acquisition ofmachinery and materials necessary for the retreading or re-capping of tires, inasmuch as a considerable saving in rubberwould be effected thereby.
8.   The Hiaaion is ready to assist the Government ofIndia in securing the equipment and materials necessary to implement these recommendations.Chemicals and DrugsChemicals.* Most of India&apos;s requirements for fine and heavy chemicals are met by imports, although in 1938 there were 30 chemical factories in india with about 4,500 employees.!/   That country&apos;s dependence on imports forchemicals is indicated by the value of the different types received fromabroad in 1939, as shown below:Types Value ir. rupeesDyes and tanning materials 34,725,889Industrial chemicals 34,308,188Drugs and medicines 22,865,081Fertilizers 12,048, 971Paints and painters&apos; materials 8,805,556Miscellaneous2/ 2,353.930Total!/ 115.107.615The chemical industry in India, however, is expanding.     Notableincreases have occurred reoently in the production of sulphuric andnitric acids and of aluminium sulphate;   there has also been some in-erease in the production of hydrochloric acid, sodium sulphate, andmagnesium sulphate.In general, the importation of chemicals into India is due to theabsence of necessary equipment and technical personnel.     For most basicchemicals the essential raw materials are available in India.     Variousprojects for the production of chemicals are set forth in the fo?lowingmemorandum submitted to the Mission by the Government of India:&quot;This statement shows India&apos;s position in regard to 24chemicals which are important to the war effort, and for theincreased production of which, in India, American assistance might be possible.     In the basic alkali group the mostimportant shortage is that of caustic soda.     If India is tobe made self-sufficient, manufacture to the extent of 20,000tons per annum will have to be established.     If this stepwere taken, and the electrolytic process used, chlorine andbleaching powder which are also at present in very short sup-ply, could be made in sufficient quantities to meet all Indianrequirements.    At present indigenous production of causticsoda amounts to about 6,000 tons.    Ndw plant is under erection1/ 15 of the 30 factories are located in Bengal.2/ Includes printers&apos; ink, gelatin, glue, perfumed spirit, and de-natured spirit.3/ Source:   Compiled from official statistics of the Government ofIndia.
which is expected to produce a further 8,700 tons by the uusaerof 1942.     A further capacity of 20,000 tons is needad.    Theestablishment of such a plant would also enable bleaching powderand chlorine deficiencies to be met.&quot;There is a shortage of what are generally known as ooal-tar chemicals with the exception of benzene..    Production couldbe increased if the iron and steel&apos; industry were expanded andnew coke ovens set up.     Benzene is at present being used mainlyas a petrol substitute.     It could be utilized us cue of the primary chemicals for a dyestuff s industry but considerableplant and technical knowledge would have to be obtained to pxo-duce the vast range of products neoassary.     Furthermore, otherbasic dyestuffs chemicals such as toluene and naphthalene areat present in short supply on account of heavy defense demands.Phenol is also required for the manufacture of plastics, as areformaldehyde and urea.     Formaldehyde manufacture is being uitab-lished on a small scale in Mysore and the production of urea isvery little beyond the experimental stage.     Both these chemicalsas well as phenol would have to be Imported in order to estab-lish a plastics industry to- manufacture bakelite and beetleware.&quot;Chenacaxs required by the ordnance factories forammunition production. - These are acetone, nitric and sulphuricacids, ethyl alcohol, ammonia and ammonium sulphate, lime,toluene, dimethylani1ine and glycerin.     Indigenous productionof sulphuric acid, while ample to meet ordnance factory re-quirements, is not sufficient to meet all the needs of Indianindustry.     For this purpose an additional plant to expand pro-duotion by about 10,000 tons will be required.     The position is satisfactory in the case of other chemicals required for ammuni-tion production, except toluene and dimethylanlline, and poasiblyammonia.     The toluene deficiency is about 1,300 tons.     In-creased production, as stated above, under coal-tar chemicalsdepends upon expansion of the iron and steel industry and the setting up of new coke ovens.     Dime thy lan 11 ine requires methylalcohol as one of the primary materials, and production of thisalcohol is at present limited to recovery from the wood distil-lation plants of the Mysore Iron and steel Co.    There is a project under consideration in connection with the- production ofantigas ointment for the setting up of acetic acid   production by wood distillation, and methyl alcohol would be obtained as abyproduct.    Advice and plant may be required for production ofacetic acid from alcohol or molasses.&quot;Other ammunition requirements are the carbonates, nitratesand peroxides of barium and strontium and potassium chlorateand perohlorate for pyrotechnics;   reduced hammerscale andaluminium powder for incendiary bombs;   also sodium azide andmercury for detonators.     Most of these chemicals are requiredin comparatively snwl 1. quantities and production is being est&amp;b-lished wherever possible.     In other cases imports should not present difficulty as the total quantities involved will onlyamount to a few tons.
Plans are now going forward for the acquisition of a plant for theproduction of refined sulphur frca the sulphur rook of Baluchistanwhich contains about 50 perosat of siliceous impurities.    t project laalso under conoid oration for the establishment in India of a plant forthe manufacture of coal-tar derivatives which are the essential bases in the manufacture of explosives and chemical products.    Tha byproductsof such a plant would Include coke, gas, assMnlnm sulphate, light oils,and tar.    The light oils are used in the production of T.H.T. and theamaonlua sulphate In the sssufaoture of fertiliser.    far has many uses;it is especially important in the construction of roads.    Coke and gasare valuable byproducts that could be used by iron and steel aills.The Government of India already has on crdar equipment for a plant to produce ammonia.    And it is considering the possibility of securingthe necessary equipment for plants to manufacture sodium sulphide andantlvera, a chemical to counteract the effect of poison gas.    although there are several factories for the production of paint in India, ia-porta are substantial.    Moreover, the requirements for paint in india are likely to increase because of the enlarged, war demand.    A con-siderable saving in shipping could be effected if India were to becomeself-sufficient in the manufacture of this product..   Nearly all of thenecessary raw materials for the production of paint are available inIndia.SHBJ.India is responsible for the supply of medical stores of all kindsto the armed forces in the Far Eastern command, and for the supply ofthose medical stores that it produces, to the arnsd forces in theMiddle Eastern cosasnd.    Considerable difficulty has been experienced in obtaining medical supplies from the United Kingdom, and consequently the production of drugs In India has been expanded.    Whereas before thewar only 25 percent of the medical stores for the Army were manufactured in India, 60 percent of the Arsr&apos;6 requirements are now produced there.Thsre are &amp;any ite&amp;s, however, that are not manufactured In India, andthe quantity of drugs produced there is not always adequate to meet bothtue ailitary and civilian dnaeds.Tho production of drugs in India is chiefly in Covernment depots.Siare is a private industry but it is of recent origin and small incapacity.    The policy of the Government has been to continue the manu-manufacture of drugs in its own depots until private industry is able tosupply the demand.    In pursuance of this policy, the Government is considering the installation of an additional plant for the manufactureof drugs in India, in order that that country might become practicallysalf-sufficient In these important products.    The Installation and theoperation of gush a plant would doubtless require the services of&quot;Large volcanic depoeita of sulphur rook have been foundin Ealuchifltan and the Government of India has arranged toexcavate and sail erode sulphur for direct use In &quot;Chamber&apos;sulphuric sold plants.

Textilesjute and jute manufactures.India is the solo source of the world1a supply of jute, and thatproduct, next to cotton, is India&apos;a largest agricultural export.     Pro-duation is centered in Bengal which accounts for about 90 percent of thetotal)   other producing areas are the Provinces of Assam, Bihar, andOriasa.     In recent years production has ranged from 5,500,000 bales(1931) to 13,000,000 (1940);   the average annual production has been about 9,000,000 bale a.!/   Sowing begins each year toward the end ofFebruary and is completed by the end of May;   the crop is harvested inthe months of July through September.     Approximately one-half of thetotal orop is exported as raw jute, and the remainder is manufacturedinto heeeian or gunny cloth and bags in Indian mills.     Most jute manu-factares are also exported, inasmuch as India&apos;a requirements are notlarge.     Before the war continental Europe was the principal market for indian exports of raw jute and the United States was the principalmarket for jute manufactures, especially the cloth known in this c com try-as burlap.In the decade 1930-39 the jute witim of India suffered severelyfrom overproduction.    As a result the Government of Bengal, in 1938,promulgated an ordinance restricting output.     Under the Bengal JuteRegulation Act the Government of Bengal has the authority to control theamount of jute sown in each season.With the outbreak of the war an unusual demand was placed upon thejute mills, and the plantings of jute were increased.     The crop in 1940amounted to 13,100,000 bales which, together with the 2,300,000 balesleft over from the previous season, created unusually large stocks for manufacture or export.     The fall of France and the closing of oonti-nental European markets curtailed the exports of raw jute so that7,900,000 bales remained in stock wb/sn the harvesting of the 1941 cropbegan.    This crop was the first to be regulated in Bengal and theaoreage sown was two-thirds of that in 1940*   &apos; The yield in 1941 wasabout 5,400,000 bales, making a supply of 13,300,000.    The probabledemand for the fiscal year 1941-42 is estimated at about 8,500,000 bales,and the carry-over before the 1942 crop, at 4,800,000.    Sowings in the1942 season will be so regulated as to satisfy all probable demands inthe fiscal year 1942-43, but no margin above estimated requirements hasbeen allowed because of the necessity for stimulating the production office, the supply of which has been curtailed by the fall of Burma.Before the war, when the jute mills in India were working 45 hours a week, they consumed annually about 6,750,000 bales .5/  Shortly afterthe war began, the Government allowed an extension of working timebeyond the normal maximum of 54 hours a week permitted by the Factory   -Act to 60 hours a week on single shift.    On this basis the mills woulda on bum about 7,200,000 bales annually 2J  The raw material position,therefore, is satisfactory.X/ Each bale weighs 400 pounds.2/ As reported by officials of the Department of Supply, Governmentof India.
1Cotton and cotton bpinrfaotareb.India is the world&apos;8 second largest producer of cotton, beingexceeded only by the United States.    annual production averages about,000,000 bales of 400 pounds each.    The cultivation of cotton is widely distributed throughout India, but there are two principal pro-dubing regions:   The south-central section of the country embracingBombay, the Central provinces, the State of Hyderabad, and Madras;   andthe northern section Including the Punjab and the United Provinces.The average annual, yield of cotton per acre is appreciably lower inIndia than in the United State8, and very much lower than in Egypt.Customarily, about one-half of the cotton produced in India is used, bylocal cotton textile and the remainder is exported.     Before thewar the principal market was Japan.    The closing of this market has created a surplus of raw cotton in India which is only partially offset by the enlarged demand of Indian mills.     These wills have increased their production to meet war demands and to compensate for the cessation of imports of cotton manufactures from Japan.    Although India has a surplus of cotton available for export, it is short-staple cotton.India, therefore, must import annually about 42,000 bales each of east african and Egyptian raw cotton for the spinning of fine thread countsto be used in the manufacture of certain war supplies.The manufacture of cotton textiles is undoubtedly the largest&apos;industry in India.    There are about 390 mills in the country, with10,000,000 spindles and 200,000 looms.    The workers employed numberabout 450,000.    The annual output of these mills is between 5 billionand 6 billion yards.    The cotton spinning and weaving industry iscentered in the presidency of Bombay which accounts for approximately two-thirds of the total production.    The two principal centers ofproduction in the Province are the cities of Bombay and Ahmedabed.India&apos;s total production of 8 billion yards, which includes the annual output of the hand-Zoom industry of 2 billion yards, is sufficient tomeet that country&apos;s military and civilian requirements.     Indeed, thecotton textile industry has pledged 20 percent of its production tomeet military requirements and would, if necessary, increase thispercentage.Inasmuch as the capacity of the cotton textile milla is adequate tocare for India&apos;s requirements, no major projects for new plants arenecessary.    A limited amount of additional equipment, however, is re-quired to obtain the maxima potential capacity of existing mills.Host of this machinery will be obtained from the United Kingdom whichsupplied the initial installations.     In order to obtain additionalIndia has 110 Jute nil la, moat ol* which are in or near Calcutta inthe Province cf Bengal.    These wills have more than 1,300,000 spindlesand 68,676 looms, and daploy more than 250,000 persons.    Operating onthe basis of 60 hours a week, their annual production of cloth and bagsexceeds 1,300,000 tons.     India1s war and essential civilian require-bents for jute goods are estimated at about 46,000 tons;   the remainderis available for export.    The primary problem affecting jute and juteproducts, therefore, is not production but transportation which hasbeen adversely affected by the closing of the Bay of Bengal to ships ofthe United Hations.    Jute and jute products, exported from India, must first be transported across the country by rail to Bombay or one of theother west-coast ports, and shipments are being retarded because ofthis and other unusual burdens placed on the railroads.
power and to liana adequate facilities for emergencies, however, theGovernment.of India has requested that the United States supply a fewelectric motors for use in the cotton textile industry.Wool and wool Manufactures.The total wool clip of India is estimated at about 200,000 balesof 330 pounds each, or 66,000,000 pounds.    Production is widely distributed throughout India, but the principal, centers are the Punjab,the United Provinces, Slnd, end Baluchistan.    Before the war exports from India ranged from 40,000,000 to 50,000,000 pounds.    The UnitedKingdom and the United States were the principal markets.    In 1941-42India imported 13,400,000 pounds of Australasian and South African wooland 10,600,000 pounds of Australian tops.The production of wool in India is sore than adequate for thatcountry&apos;s manufacturing capacity for blankets, both machine- and hand-wovan.    Most Indian wool, however, is not suitable for coabing,although a few frontier types and the Tibetan wools, with a combinedclip of about 5,000,000 pounds annually, can be combed for use in thecoarse varieties of worsted and hosiery yarns.     The quality of the finished article, however, is inferior, and the combing yield is 40percent less than for Australian and South African wools.    The combingof local wool, therefore, would greatly reduce the efficient use ofcombing equipment which, even when employed to capacity on importedwools, is only sufficient to meet about 40 percent of India&apos;s war re-quiremente.    The remainder must be imported chiefly from the UnitedKingdom or Australasia in the form of tops, finished woolen materials,knitted garments, or knitting yarn which is utilised by the cottageindustries as well as the mills.There are about 30 woolen and worsted mills in India.    The woolenindustry is small, with limited output.    The industry has about 45,400spindles with an adequate complement of looms, and is engaged in theproduction of heavy woolens, such as blankets, heavy coating materials,and serges to meet the military demand.    The blankets are made entire-ly from Indian wool, and mill production, amounting to 2,500,000annually, is supplemented by hand-woven and hand-spun blankets whichare being produced at the annual rate of about 2,000,000.     ftnTT&quot;?&apos;1 re-quirements for use in India and for expert, however, amount to5,000,000 blankets;   thus there is an *T&apos;rT&quot;&quot;*l deficiency of about500,000.    The heavy coating materials and serges are customarily made from imported wool.    The coating materials can be made from Indianwools, but the quality does not compare favorably with those made fromimported wool.    The worsted industry in India has about 33,700spindles and an adequate number of looms, but these are quite insuffi-oient to meet the demand for worsted materials and hosiery.The entire output of the wool Eanufacturing industry has beentaken over by the Government of Indie for the duration of the war.     Toincrease India&apos;s manufacturing capacity for woolens and worsteds tomeet war demands, the Government has estimated that the following addd-tioaal equipment would be required;
Spindles for woolens70,COO with all necessarycoanles*antary equipmentSpindles for worsteds50,000 with combing and othercomplementary equipmentLooms3,000to provide the necessary raw material   for this additional plant, it - Isfurther estimated that 45,000,000 pounds of row wool would be requiredannually.    Host of this wool would have to be imported, but wool forthe manufacture of blankets obnld be obtained locally.    Inasmuch asall, or nearly all, of the machinery required far this industrial expansion would come from the United Kingdom, the Government of Indiasiade no request for assistance from the American Technical Mission.Silk and silk manufactures.Raw silk is produced in southern India in Mysore Sttts and Madras,and in northern India in the Provinces of Bengal, Bihar, Assam, andKashmir.    Anrninl production amounts to about 1,600,000 pounds, but ofthis quantity only about 350,000 pounds is filature-reeled, theremainder being hand-reeled and cot of standard quality.    Only silkthat is filature-reeled is suitable for the manufacture of parachutes.The total production of this type of silk is being purchased ezcluslve-ly by the Government.    Indie, is act a large exporter of silk.    In-deed, the country is a net importer of that commodity which is used inthe production of special types of hand-woven textiles characteristicof India.The annual value of the silk goods produced in India has been estimated to range from $20,000,000 to 125,000,000.    There are threeEmail mills, in Calcutta, Bombay, and Mysore, in which silk fabrics aremanufactured on power-driven loose, but the quantity of raw silk uti-11red in these mills is s very Email part of the total, the hand-loomweaver being by far the largest consumer.    Important weaving centersare Benares, in the united Provinces, and Surat, in the Presidency of bombay.    Other centers are in the Punjab, Bengal, the Central Prov-inces, Bihar, Mysore, Madras, and Kashmir.    Escorts of silk goods erenot large, most of the production being consumed locally.    The hand-loom industry is protected by a duty imposed on both silk and -rayon,effective May 1934.BecpraYmrintlonfl.1.   The Mission recommends that every effort be made to expedite the movement of jute products by rail, although it recognises the unusual conditions under which the railroadsof Indln are now operating.2.   Inasmuch as the capacity for the manufacture of juteproducts in India exceeds the effective export demand, theMission recommends the conservation of electric power by the closing of those jute mills, the products of which are not now required.     ^
3.   The Mission recommends that the request of theGovernment of ttihib for electric motors to provide addi-tional power and emergency equipment for the cotton textile industry be supplied through the Lend-Lease Administration.4*   The Mission recommends that efforts be made to expand the capacity for the production of filature-reeledsilk in order that more substantial quantities of this important material may be made available for the manufac-ture of parachutes for India and others of the United Hations.Hides, Skins, and LeatherIt is estimated that there are about 200,000,000 cattle, 26,000,000goats, and 22,000,000 sheep in India.     Because of the religious tenetsof a large number of the Indian people, only a srcal1 percentage ofIndian raw hides are from animals actually killed or slaughtered;   mostof the hides are from animals that have died from natural causes.     Theannual production of marketable raw hides is estimated at about,000,000.     In relation to the number of cattle, this production is considerably below that in most other cattle-raising countries.     More-over, the average quality of the hides from India is lower than that ofhides from the United States end Argentina.India is the world&apos;s third largest producer of sheepskins, beingexceeded only by the United States and Australia;   average productionin India is somewhat in excess of 15,000,000 skins.     India, however,1b the largest producer of goat and kid skins in the world;   annualproduction amounts to about 34,500,000 skins, or approximately 30 per-cent of the world total.India is a large exporter of hides and skins.     Exports of these products free India in recent years are shown in table 16.Table 16. - Hides and skins:   Exports from IndiaType            ;	Fiscal year 1935-36	Average 1934-38	April 1, 1941 to March 31. 1942	Hides^- Raw - Tanned Skins2/- Raw---- Tanned --	Tons .     22,677 ;    14,029 :    21,195 :      6,275	1,000 pcs. i      4,556 50,012	Tons 8,915 16,994 25,878 i     3,632	1,000 pcs. 2,126 36,682X/ Principally cattle hides.2/ Principally goat and sheep skins.Source:   Official statistics of the Government of India.RjjCOTmendatlons-C on tinned.
foe recent decline in the exports of hidea and skins fioa India la daai too closing of markets in continental Europe and Japan to the prod-ita of India, and to the increased demand for hides and skins withinIndia.    The decline in the exports of hides occurred entirely la rawbides, tanned hides hawing increased somewhat over previous rears.She deed Ins in exports of skins, however, is duo chiefly to the roduo-tion in exports of tanned skins.    Host of the hides are customarilyexported from Calcutta, and most of the skins, from Calcutta, Bombay,Karachi, and Madras.    Since the closing of the Bay of Bengal, however),this traffic has been diverted to ports on the west coast.In 1933 there were 14. leather and shoe factories, 32 tanneries,and 9 hide and skin processing plants in India.    These plants arelocated principally la Cawapore, Bombay, and Madras.    Since the out-fcrsak of war the production of leather and leather goods has beenexpanded appreciably because of the Increased demand for consumptionwithin India and for export to the United Kingdom.    Exports of bootsand shoes, for example, were 4,000,000 pairs In the 12 months beginningApril 1, 1941, as compared with 3,000,000 pairs in 1939*    The unitedKingdom is the principal overseas market for tanned hides and skinsfrom India;   it is also the principal market for leather goods, especially-otally boots and shoes.    India&apos;s military and essential civilianrequirements for boots and shoes, and the orders placed in India forthese products by the united Kingdom, exceed India&apos;s productivecapacity.    This natter was called to the attention of the Mission bythe Qovsmsent of India which requested assistance in obtaining addi-ttoakl machinery and equipment for the manufacture of boots and shoes.BeeoBaandatlons.1.   The Mission reocoaaenda that the additional equipmentnecessary for the Government of India to meet its require-meats for boots and shoes be wads available through the lead-Lease Adalnistration.2.   The Mission suggests that any substantial Increasein the productive capacity for shoes and other leather goodsaay plane a severe burden on the tanneries of India.    TheGovernment of India, therefore, aay wish to consider thepossibility of wrpnrirtlng the capacity of tanneries as well asleather factories.    The Mission is willing to assist the -Government in obtaining the machinery and equipment necessaryfor such expansion.Timber and LumberForests cover about one-fifth of the land area of India.    british india hag nearly 95,000 square miles of timberland, or acre than 11 per-oent of the country&apos;s total area;   in addition, there are extensivetracts of timber in the Indian States.    It is estimated that the annualyield of timber and fuel frost India&apos;a forests amounts to about376,000,000 cubic feet.    The forest areas are well-distributed through-out the country;   in the north are the great oonlferous forests of theHimalayas, In the south the teak and furniture woods of the Bo a ternGhats j end in the central region the varied timbers of the jungle areas.There are about 28 different Indian woods already in ooaseroe, and insome instances, as many as 12 different grades of one kind of timberus recognised.
Large quantities of tiabor are required by the arasd forces withinIndia and la other Bagrlro couatxisfl.    In response to this demand india has exported substantial quantities of timber and lumber to  spireoooatrlsa and to others of the United nations.    Because of the enlarged demand, it is anticipated that the production of sawed timberin India say amount to as mnh as 750,000 tons in 1942.    In addition,the lumber industry is currently engaged la the production of10,000,000 tent poles and 76,000,000 tent pegs.    Large quantities ofImsber are required for the ocnstruetioa of barracks, iwm11.1 on boxes,and other products for the armed forces.    Moreover, timber is ofcourse in demand for such indirect war uses as the construction oftelegraph poles, railway ties, wharf tiabera- sad bridgeo.In addition to Ixanber, India&apos;s forests provide a variety of rawmaterials for the aamwXactnre of paper, and substantial amounts cfsuch materials are aaanally exported.    Share are several pulp and paper mills la India, located in Bombay, Bengal, the United Provinces,Madras, Punjab, and Travanoore.    These mills produce wood pulp and,prior-to the war, - bey also manufactured annually 33,000 tons of bamboopulp and 22,000 tons of cabal grass pulp.    India&apos;a paper mills pre-duoe kraft, writing, and printing paper, and supply about one-fifth oflocal rcquirssanta.The forests of India axe under the direct control of the Govern-cent.    Private lumbering operations are conducted under license andhsvs been a source of considerable govsransntel revenue.    The forestresources of the country, however, do not appear to have been adcquately developed, end only a email part of the total is actually being exploited.    The Department of Supply, operating through the provia-oial Governments, now exercises considerable control over the dlstribu-tion of timber in India.    The Timber Directorate of the Departmentarranges for all purchases of timber, leaner, and woodwork required bythe defense cervices.    The agencies for obtaining timber are the forest Dapaxtsvents of the provinces and States which, in this oomnec-tion, operate as executive branches of the TLiiber Directorate.    the directorate maintains timber depots at Karachi, Bombay, Cochin, andCalcutta, having a capacity of about 60,000 tons of timber.    Thesedepots are designed to sect the daaaads of Overseas Cosawmds.The estimated direct and Indirect requirements of sawed timber forthe armed forces in 1942 are 750$GOG tons.    Of this quantity, only about 450,000 tons can be sawed by hand in the forests;   the nan tartaroast be sawed at the mills.    Although there has bean a considerable increase in mill capacity, the current annual output Is estimated at only 150,000 tons.    In order to meat defense requirements, therefore,the Soverrsant of India requested that additional equipment for saw-mills be made available.    It suggested that the most efficient type ofmachinery for work In India would be small, portable mills, drivea bysteam, and that the aggregate aonaal capacity of these should be100,000,000 board feat, or 166,666 tons. All sawmill equipment, In-eluding baud end circular earns, must be imparted Into India, with theexception of small band sews suitable only for cutting softwoods.

ThisI    itloo greatly Increases the weight of the Incber transported by the.. ...irer?.dfl.    It adds, of oourso, to the cost of transportation and repre-eeats an insfficieat utilisation of transportation facilities.    If dry-ing kilns were erooted adjacent to the sawmilla or to lnraber adlla atths railheads, it would be possible to season the limber prior to ship-as nt. thereby effecting an increase in transportation efficiency and areduction in its cost.In addition to Indigenous woods, India requires annually between15,000 and 20,000 tons of Oregon pine for shipbuilding and ship repaira,there baling no adequate cnbstltuts available there.    Supplies of Indianfir end spruoe are located in the ncrthseatern Eiffel ayes, and are too far frost the shipbuilding and ship-repair yards to perait their eooaocs-io.il transportation.    Moreover, the timber must be floated down narrowstreams to roach the railways &quot;and therefore can only bo supplied in short lengths.     The Indian Govermsent requested that adequate amounts of Oregon pise be supplied by either the United States or Canada.Although the plywood industry in India has recently been expanded,its production is now about 5*000,000 square feat and is justadequate to meet military requirements and those for the manufacture oftea chests.    India has additional and increasing need for plywood forthe assembly and repair of aircraft and for the eaaufacture of lightpontoons and assault boats.    Tor the manufacture of such plywood, theGovercsont of India requires modern machinery, Including hot presses;it would also require equipment for the manufacture of synthetic rosinrhioh is now produced only in very small amounts.India consume annnally about 3,500,000 square feet of wallboard,each as Celotax or Masonlte, most of which is imported.    It would bopossible to expand appreciably the ocasuaption of this product for bothbilitary and essential oivilian requireesata, end thus eliminate seas ofthe no-Msaentlal uses of lumber.    India has adequate supplies of raasatorials for the production of wallboard but lacks the necessarybachinsry and equipment.Eeccgaaadatflons.1.   The Mission recommends that the Government of Indiareview carefully its administration of forest resources in anattempt to improve their developsant and exploitation, notonly bacause of the advantages to be derived from such apolicy In the present emergency, but also because of thebenefits that weald be certain to accrue in the future.2. It reoorassnds that India be supplied with portablestess-drlvaa sawmills, having a combined annual capacity ofat least 100,000.000 beard feet.
Rt n *mi iiktatlona-Ocotlnned.3.   It suggests that careful study be given to the prob-len of transporting inmber Bade of Indian fir and spruce fromthe Himalayas to the principal consuming centers.    should this prove impractical, the Mission recommends that adequatequantities of Oregon pine be made available to India for usein the repair of ships and in essential ship construction.A.   It also recommends that additional machinery andequipment for the manufactaxs of plywood be mads available toIndia in order that the Government may meet the increaseddenand that military necessity has placed upon it.5.  It further recommends that the machinery and equip-ment necessary for the manufacture of wallhoard be made avail-able to the Government of India in order that local productionmay replace imports.FoodstuffsInasmuch as most foodstoffs are products of agriculture, they donot come directly within the purview of the Mission.    It wishes, bow-ever, to more a few comments on related subjects which it believes might affect, at least indirectly, India1! industrial war effort.    India has long been a very large producer of rloe, the annual quantity harvestedbeing about 25,000,000 tons.    Although production in India accounts for about two-fifths of the world total, this rice has all been oon-Bumed within the country and large quantities, ranging from 1,500,000to 2,500,000 tons, have regularly been imported from Burma, Thailand,and French Indochina.    These regions are not now possible suppliersand, therefore, production in India must be increased to meet basic re-quiremsnts.    Because of the urgency of this situation, the Mission wasgratified to note the energetic steps being taken by the Government ofIndia to stimulate the cultivation of this essential cereal.    Tea isalso a major agricultural crop In India, but it presents no special problem, except that of transportation fxcm the principal producingcenters in Assam, Bengal, Travsnoore, and madras to the United Kingdomand the united States.The Mission feels Impelled to call attention to the lack of modernslaughterhouses sad refrigeration plants In India.    Such equipment, itbelieves, Is essential to the proper rationing of the armed forces ofthe United Kingdom and the United States.    Despite possible political difficulties, it suggests that the Government of India, as a war measure,may wish to consider the advisability of erecting sash plants.    Simi-larly, the Mission observed what appeared to be a need for the purifica-tion of two basic constituents in diet, salt and water.    Inasmuch assalt is i Government monopoly, the installation of a salt purificationplant should present no great difficulty.    And the chlorine produced InIndia could be used to assist In the purification of the water supply atlocations judged to be strategic by the armed forces.
202Two specific problems relating to foodstuffs wore placed beforethe HI salon by the Government of India.    One of these was the proaerr-ing of fruits, vegetable a, and jaas, the raw materials for which are*n produced locally.    India18 annual requirements for these productswere reported to be as follow siInasmuch as the preservation of these foodstuffs would conserve India&apos;salready Inadequate supplies, and would effect an appreciable saving in shipping, the project appears worthy of serious consideration.The Government of India reported to the Mission that its annualcapacity for producing any seryioe biscuits!/was only 5,000 tons andthat the annual de-md of the armed forces was for 10,000 tons.    Itrequested the assistance of the Mission in obtaining additional equip-aent with which to double its present biscult-raaking capacity.   If the capacity for the production of biscuits and bread should be appreciablyincreased, it sight be necessary also to expand the capacity of floornills in India to met the increased rlsmsnrt of the bakeries for flourof the proper type.    The Mission suggests that the Governaent of Indiasay wish to investigate this possibility.1.   Should it be requested by the Goveraaant of India,the Mission rsooamends that efforts be bade to secure forIndia machinery and enuipi^nt necessary for the preservation of vegetables, fruits, jaas, and marmalades as a measure forthe conservation of both food and shipping.2.   The Mission strongly urges that the request of theQovemasnt of India for the equipment necessary to producesmana] 1y 5,000 tons of army Borvioe biscuits be promptlygranted.Exports sad Technicians from the Baited states the reoosmnndatioss made by the Mission arc designed to increasethe capacity and production of a number of Indian industries essentialto the war effort.    The Implementation of these recommendations for theexpansion of production will take three principal forms x   (1) The ereo-tion of new plants, (2) the installation of additional equipment in existing plants, and (3) the rearrangement of the machinery and equip-msnt in existing plants.    For this work the services of a number of experts and technicians will be required and Tp^H&quot; mill be toprovide all of the skin ad personnel necessary to accomplish the task.TonsCanned vegetables,including timmtoeaCanned fruitsjam and marmalade6,0004,0004,000Recommendations.1/ The army service biscuit in India Is made from heavy doughs  w*v*nbaked, it weighs 16 biscuits to the pound and is 3 inches by 2-3/4inches by 5/16 inch in dn.
The Goversaant of India, therefore, requested the Uiaoloa to assist itin obtaining tha sarsiooa of several trained teohnioians and experts   v\from the Ualtad States vho, by virtue of their knowledge and export-once, could act as temporary advisers on. industrial production. -As a result of its investigations the Mission suggested to theGovernment of India that experts bs sent from the united States toassist in solving the problems in transportation that have arisen ba-cause of the unusual burdens plaoed upon the railways and the oonges-tion at west-coast ports.2*   Moreover, to stimulate industrial prodso-tion, the mission suggested that six produotion engineers from theunited States be sent to India.    These experts, acting as advisers tothe Government of India, would be able to offer constructive suggee-tlons for the Improvement of plant arrange taut and methods of produc-tion in privately ownsd factories and in those aimed by the Govern-sent.     The Government of India approved these suggestions and offered to make such experts its guests during their stay la India.    TheMission, on its part, agreed to recossnend that the salaries of theseexperts and their traveling expenses should be borne by the Governmentof the united States.Because of plans to increase the production of essential war materials, officials of the Government of India have stated that, forspecial assignments, they would require the services of additionalexperts from the United States and requested the assistance of theMission in obtaining them.    The traveling expanses and salaries ofall such experts would bs paid by the Government of India.    officials of the Government asked for three technicians for the manufacture of machine tools who could supervise the programs of existing workshops,and who could teach and demonstrate produotion technique.     It askedfor two expert jig and tool makers and two expert jig and tool setters.It requested the services of an expert in the manufacture of tools,particularly shell tools, and for an expert in nonferrous petals whohas training and experience in metallurgical work, including casting,drawing, and rolling.    It also asked for two instrument makersskilled in the manufacture of surveying and other scientific instru-ments.     These requests were endorsed by the Mission and a telegram was despatchad to the Govercssnt of the United States asking that in-quiries be made concerning the possibility of obtaining the servicesof auoh men.Should other recommendations of the Mission be implemented, offi-officials of the Government of India indicated that they would requireadditional expert assistance.     Specific mention was made of expertsfor die casting, sulphur refining, coal-tar distillation, and themanufacture of record syringes and surgeons&apos; gloves.     Concerningthese possible requests, the Mission agreed to render whatever assist-anoe it could whan the need should arise.Officials of the Tata Iron and Steel Company asked the Mission,while it was In Jamshedpur, to assist the company in obtaining fromthe United States the services of two production engineers.     It isthe plan of the company to make one of the engineers superintendent incharge of its railroad wheel, tire, and axle plant.    The otherengineer would advise the company concerning the operations of itsmachine shops, with a view to increasing their load and efficiency.1/ has* rfxvtmbmwiiirticmfi^ nn-mnw qq Transportation fin-wip-lwuna.
20LaborThe Government of India and sosa of&apos; the Indian States have in-augurated schools for the training of various types of teohnioians,ranging from chauffeur mechanics to machine-tool operators.    In oddi-tion, several of the large factories have training prcgra&amp;s for youngand inexperienced employees.    The Mission was impressed with the goodquality and excellent potentialities of Indian labor.    The Indian isskillful with his hands, and, given satisfactory working conditionswith security of employment, is dependable and industrious.In a number of plants visited by&quot; the Mission, workers who had never been in an industrial plant until recently were doing skilledwork, and the labor turn-over was ratal 1.     These plants are tha exoop-tion rather than the rule, but the aooctap] 1 ahments there could beachieved elsewhere.    Even in sonsa subj oat to air attacks, laborershave remained at their work.    The Tata Iron and Steel Company is agood example.    while some plants in and around Calcutta have beenlosing as high as 50 percent of their labor because of apprehensionconcerning hostilities, the Tata Company in an equally hazardous posi-tion has had almost bo loss.    The flight of labor from the Calcuttaarea, where about 75 percent of war production is taking place, pre-ssnts a serious current and future threat to sustained production.The Mission is not impressed by the argument of many industrialiststhat special wage bonuses in danger areas will stimulate, rather thandiminish, the &quot;flight from plant&quot; because laborers will wish to cpaadthe so extra earnings in their hose villages.    The Tata Company andsome other plants have had no such experience.    The Tata Company hasa system of bonuses and has acquired a 4 weeks&apos; supply of food near theplants;   it also has hostels and air shelters which give the workers a sense of security frca the hazards of air attack.    Workers are much the same the world over.    They will respond favorably to good working conditions, security of employment, and opportunity for increasedearnings.1.   The Mission recounoods to the Government of theUnited States that experts be soda available to advise theGovernment of India on problems pertaining to transporta-tion and industrial produotion.2.   It agreed to assist the Government of India inobtaining from the United States various teohnioians and experts to assist in its program for the expansion of theproduotion of essential war materials.3.   It agreed to assist the Govomaont of India inobtaining additional expert aaaiatanco when a pooIficneeds should arise.4.   It further agreed to assist the Tata Iron andSteel Company in obtaining from the United States theservices of two production engineers.
The labor training program cf the Department of Labor seems wellconceived and ably directed.    It is doubtful, however, that Itspresent scope is adequate for the required expansion of industrial pro-duotion in India.    At least twice the present number of trainees wouldseem to be necessary.    While training by the Department must be eup-plemented in the plants where the young men will be employed, it re-duoes the tlaw of training that would otherwise be required in theplants.    The Mission feels strongly that plant training must also be greatly augmented.    Plant managers are somewhat reluctant to make ln-vestment in training, but the experience of industrial countries nv*the united States demonstrates that sums spent for this purpose are fully Justified from the standpoint of both the volume and cost ofproduction.The technical personnel which the Mission is seeking in the unitedStates will aid in attaining the aims of the training program by theIntroduction of refinements in the technique of mass production.Trained personnel can usually increase its production if the ratio ofmachinery to manpower is also increased.    Moreover, mass-productionplants require less ckill per unit of output than do jobbing plants.The increased industrialisation in India, whether for purposes ofwar or peace, and the effective training of labor, will be largelyconditioned by the attitude of the Government and the Industrialiststoward wages and labor conditions.    There must be a real incentive in increased earning power to Induce young nan to seek and accept training.Given the possibility of steadily increasing earnings, favorable working conditions, and adequate security, India will rapidly develop a body of skilled labor adequate for the expanding program of war production.Recomwmndatlons.1.   The Mission reoommerds that the training programsconducted by the Department of Labor of the Government cfIndia and by soaae of the Indian States be expanded, as rapidly as possible, to at least twice their present sise.2.   It reco-ends that the Government of Indiaencourage the expansion of training programs in privateindustries end the Inauguration of such programs in those industries which are not now conducting them.3.   It further recoeaesds that the Government ofIndia adopt a policy designed to enhance the earningpower of labor, to Improve its working conditions, and toprovide increased security against both hostilities and unemployment.
20473ConclusionIn concluding this report, the Mission wishes to reaaphaalM Itsbelief In the strategic inportance of India to the causa of the united nations.    It desires again to call attention to India&apos;e groat poteo-tlalitlee for industrial production because of its wast natural andhuaan resources.    The Mission feels that the utilisation of thenatural resources can be greatly developed and expanded, providedadequate tools are bade available for that purpose, and it has seenevidence of the mechanical aptitude of Indian workmen who, given theproper incentives and working conditions, can becone skilled craftsmenafter a short period of training.The American Technical Mission to India is strongly of the opinionthat the prompt implementation of the recommendations contained in thisreport will not only strengthen the defense of India but will also par-alt that country to become a base for decisive offensive action againstthe enemy.    It believes that India affords a unique opportunity to turn the tide of battle on the  astern Front against the Axis Powers.It urges, therefore, that the moat serious consideration be given toits recriaswn Ai tlons by the Governments of India, the United Kingdom,and the United States, In order that full advantage may be taken ofthe opportunity thus presented.Birk&quot;Dels3ierFrank A.

The Mission has dealt elae-vhere with material.and machinery, and to some extent with methods.The following reocaawndationa deal with men, and, by Inference, withmethods.The problem under highly stimulated production and expansion is essentially one of quick conversion of sheer &quot;manpower&quot; into &quot;production-tive poffw- on a large scale, in a short time, to a maximum degree.Training efforts in Indian industries range from none to those that are comparable with the best in the United States.    Allowing forsome handicaps Inherent In India, the technical training sobese ofthe Departaent of Labor (March 1942) forms a good basis upon which togive young men fundamental training in the usual trades or crafts.In view of the above, and other personal observations, I nowreeommecdi1*   The appointment of a Commissioner of Industrial Training,directly under the Labor Member.2.
