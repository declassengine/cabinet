(42) 450.October 7, 1942.WAR CABINET.FRENCH MORALE.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues may be interested to see the annexed report on French morale.It represents the agreed views of the various Departments concerned, includingthe Service Departments.A. E.Foreign Office, October 7, 1942.ANNEX.FRENCH MORALE.With certain exceptions noted below, opinion throughout France is anti-Axis. It is not so uniformly pro-British. Pro-British feeling throughout Francesuffered severely under the shock of defeat. Constant anti-British propagandahas also had its effect. Pro-American feeling has not been subjected to theseinfluences. The result is that, superficially at least, the Americans are morepopular than the British. But it is to both jointly that the majority of Frenchmenlook for liberation, and an outstanding military success, particularly if achieved in the German-occupied territory of France, would win general support for bothnations. Morale throughout France is, of course, extremely sensitive to themilitary fortunes of the United Nations.Until Laval&apos;s return to power in April there was a marked differencebetween the two zones of France, morale in occupied being much higher than inunoccupied France; the inhabitants of both zones were anti-German, but in the occupied zone they were actively so, in the unoccupied zone they were apathetic.Recent reports indicate an up-swing in morale in the unoccupied zone, and itmay no longer be true to say that it is lower in one zone than the other. there remains, however, a difference of quality : the morale of the occupied zone is moreuniform and less subject to fluctuations. The special qualities of morale in thetwo zones are dealt with separately below.A. Occupied Zone.Anti-German Feeling.Anti-German feeling is high and almost universal. It finds expression inacts of violence carried out with, disregard of personal risk. These acts, however,express, in the main, personal revolt against oppression and against the prevalentfeeling- of helplessness; they do not appear to be part of any centralised plan of campaign. There is, indeed, little evidence of widespread&quot; organisation exceptwithin the Communist party (see Section D below).11870   [24455]
D. Political Influences.I. Anti-German Movements.(a) Communists. The Communist party was the only one of the old politicalorganisations to survive the collapse of France. Its structure and discipline arefirmer than those of any other group. Its organisation of centres of resistanceis generally repotted to be thorough and its membership relatively large. It issaid to be prepared to co-operate with any genuine elements of resistance, but&apos; lid &apos;cdhcrete evidence of this is available, perhaps because the Communist leadersfear to be betrayed if they confide in British or Gaullist agents.A small number of collaborationists is to be found in the occupied zone-among (i) industrial employers who have long had association with german industry or who hope to continue to receive benefits from German industrialpreponderance in the New Europe; (ii) financiers and middlemen who areprofiting by their i*elations with the Germans; (iii) self-seeking politicians; and(iv) convinced admirers of the Nazi system who hope to lead Nazi France.The population of the Occupied Zone have on thfi whole reacted well toBritish air and other attacks as long as these have been directed, successfullyagainst targets of importance to the enemy. The local reaction to certain attackswhich have caused disproportionate civilian losses has- been unfavourable.B.  Unoccupied Zone.Until Laval&apos;s return to power and more particularly before his public statement that he hoped for a German victory, the main characteristic of theunoccupied zone was apathy. The population were anti-German but passive,their chief concerns being food and employment. This applied particularly tothe middle class. A marked change has taken place under Laval. Laval&apos;s pro-German declaration of the 22nd June, the campaign to supply workers toGermany, the deportation of Jews, the new compulsory labour decree and increasing evidence of Gestapo activities in the unoccupied zone have caused aconsiderable wave of resentment and labour in industrial areas has displayedactive resistance and restlessness, especially on the 14th July last. Peasantproprietors in most districts are better fed and less discontented than other classes. As a class they are anti-Communist and have probably been influenced by the fear of a complete Russian victory.C. Armed Forces.A rmy. .*Reports suggest that the armistice army still retains hopes of revenge. Atthe outset of the Vichy regime it confined itself to blind obedience to marshal petain, but it is now reported that it will rally to the appeal of a non-politicalGeneral with a nation-wide reputation, even if the appeal were not backed byPetain. It would not follow General de Gaulle. It has a low opinion of themilitary capacity of Great Britain, cannot be considered pro-British and has atendency to xenophobia. It is certainly anti-German and would be unlikely asa whole to fight against a powerful invading army of the United Nations in metropolitan France. In the Colonies, however, it is probable that the army would offer at least a token resistance against any superior invading force.Navy.The navy is, in the main, anti-British, but also anti-German, and still moreanti-Italian. The reaction of independent units cannot be forecast. The resultsof the favourable treatment the French navy received after the armistice and ofits undefeated record in the war against Germany have combined to maintain itsmorale during a long period of comparative inactivity.A it Force.The morale of flying personnel, though it has been to some extent impairedby prolonged inactivity, remains favourable to the Allies, and there is every reason to believe that the majority of crews would welcome the opportunity&apos;bo&apos; resume active operations. Anti-British feeling is largely confined to senior officers, while anti-German sentiments are general.
On the other hand, fear of Communism is an important feature in theattitude of certain sections of the population. Outside the Communist partythere are many (clergy, peasants, bourgeois, &amp;c.) who, though they would welcomeliberation from any hand, fear the political effects of a complete Russian victory.This fear has recently declined somewhat owing to the belief that there is nolonger any great likelihood of a total Russian victory unaccompanied by Anglo-Saxon action in the west.(b) Socialist Party. It is reported that serious efforts are being made to.form a consolidated group out of various elements of the former Socialist parties.(c) France Combattante. A majority of Frenchmen support General de gaulle as a symbol of resistance. In the first instance, however, the French wouldprobably look for a focus for their spirit of resistance within France and thosewho turn to de Gaulle do so faute de mieux, other personalities, such as Petainand Weygand, having lost much of their prestige. Although the active followingof de Gaulle is small, if we were to abandon it, this would undoubtedly have a depressing effect on French morale.II. Pro-Vichy and Pro-German Parties.The chief of these parties are the League of Ex-Service Men, nominally underPetain but actually controlled by Laval, the Parti Populaire Francais, underM. Doriot, and the Rassemblement National Populaire, under M. trade at. A move-ment is on foot to unite the last two Frenchmen under Laval. As these parties are not repressed like the resistance groups they are capable of exercising aninfluence disproportionate to the amount of active support they receive from public opinion.E. Other Elements.l.-The Church.The Catholic hierarchy supported Marshal Petain after the collapse, pinning-their faith in his programme of a national revival based on religion and the family. Since the evident failure of this programme they seem to be growing moreconscious of the danger to the Church of totalitarianism. Some Catholic bishopshave recently protested against LavaFs anti-Jew measures; and in this theywere perhaps inspired by the fear that, as in Germany, the anti-Jewish campaignwould be followed by an anti-Catholic campaign. The country clergy, especially the younger members, will certainly follow this lead.Il-Youth.It is natural that the youth of France should be less apathetic than theirelders. The Chantiers de Jeunesse established by Petain provide physical training on military lines for 100,000 youths a year, and are the most important influence at work on young Frenchmen. The Chantiers are organised by military officers from the Ecole des Cadres, and it is reported that their morale is high andstrongly anti-German.
