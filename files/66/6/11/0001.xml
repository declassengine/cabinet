(*0) 81.Copy No. 24WAR CABINET.Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty on the Lord Privy Seal&apos;sMemorandum. W.P. (40) 64.1. THIS Paper is called &apos;&apos; The Extent to which Shipping considerationscall for a Review of our Import Programme.&quot; It is possible to agree with therecommendations without accepting the implications of the title. Everyonemust agree that our import programme should be reviewed and kept underreview so as to magnify our war effort; that a provisional allocation betweenthe Ministry of Supply and the Ministry of Food should be worked out for thesecond year of war; that plans and, indeed, preparations should be madein case the import situation deteriorates; and that the sacrifices required should be compared with those made in 1917-18. These steps are obviouslynecessary. If two-fifths of the national effort is to be directed to making and using munitions of war, the home consumption per head of the population mustbe very greatly reduced, and a fall in the standard of life is inevitable sooner or later.  The only questions are to what extent and when ?Nearly one-fifth of the National income is spent on imports, nearly a halfof this fifth on foodstuffs. A first step in the required reduction in home consumption though obviously only a small step can be made by diminishingimports so far as possible without reducing the war effort or our power to export.Other valid reasons mentioned by the Lord Privy Seal are that extra shippingmay be required for an expeditionary force other than the B.E.F., as well as thegeneral case for building up reserves at home in case of emergency.2. But the Lord Privy seal&apos;s main case is based upon an argument originallyput forward by the Ministry of Shipping, which seeks to prove that we shall notbe able to bring the required cargoes (estimated at 47 million tons for the first year of war) into this country.This argument can be challenged on many grounds. The simplest is thepresent war-time experience. In an estimate in November the Ministry ofShipping had shown that the probable imports for the remainder of the first war year would be 10-5 million tons in the three months November to January;12 - 5 million in the next three months February to April; and 19 million in thelast four months, May to August, making in conjunction with the goods importedin September and October over 47 million tons. Their November to January-figure has been exceeded by 680,000 tons . If their other figures are exceeded ina like proportion we shall get in well over 50 million tons; even if all the unfavourable factors mentioned in paragraph 12 come into operation we should still get over 48 million tons.   (All these figures are exclusive of oil.)3. But surely it is more pertinent to disregard the abnormal first four months and consider the position as from the beginning of this year. We have got overthe period of initial dislocation, no doubt at some cost to our stocks. What is theposition now? In January we imported 3-86 million tons, i.e., at the rate of46-3 millionjpns per annum. Even without any improvement the rate of imports would veiy nearly reach that originally considered necessary (47 million tons).But with the longer daylight hours and expected improvement in the weathera considerable increase may be anticipated. The entrances-ofmships ijri^cargo^normally increase byr one-fifth, between the worst months^January and February)&quot;&quot;&quot;[20897]
and(the. summer months (July and August). If our imports were to increase ina similar proportion, our average,rate.of import between January and Septemberwould exceed the rate of 50 million tons.4. The figures given in W.P. (G.) (40) 54, &quot; Loss of Importing Capacity dueto Marine Casualties,&quot; are far from discouraging. In W.P. (40) 64, paragraph 10,the Lord Privy Seal assumes that a vessel can only work 320 days out of the 365after allowance for survey, overhaul, &amp;c. This is equivalent to assuming that ships spend on the average l,2^3Uper cent, of their time refitting and that thatpercentage shotild be in dock on any given day. It is therefore a relief to find that on the 31st January, probably as bad a period as any in the year, only858,QO0 gross tons out of 9-467 million gross tons, i.e., 9-05 per cent, of ourtonnage, was repairing damage and docking for annual overhaul and survey.Thus the loss of importing capacity in this respect is less than three-quarters of the amount estimated in the first paper of the Lord Privy Seal.5. The statement (p. 4, paragraph 6) that &quot; the average reduction of efficiency in the use of shipping due to convoys is not less than 25-30 per cent.&quot; is anexaggeration. It is true only for short voyages, and these are the exception ratherthan the rule. The Ministry of Shipping gives 103 days as the duration of theaverage round voyage in which convoy delay accounts for 13 days. If this figure be correct, JjW-pe*centage loss of time is 12-7 if we assume average delaysas in Appendix*A. to W.P. (G.) (40) 53. Even this figure has already been improved upon. When it is remembered that nearly one-third of the tonnageentering in cargo is not in convoy, it is plain that the loss due to convoy is by nomeans so great as is asserted. If losses of that magnitude are being incurred,the)7 must be from some other cause.6. The need for a review of our import programme, however desirable, cannotjustly be based upon any failure so far of the Ministry of Shipping to bring inthe required tonnage under the protection of the Navy, always provided that theoriginal estimate of 47 million tons for our import requirements was correct.7. It would, however, be unsafe to assume that the proviso will be fulfilled.Already we are told, by the Minister of Supply in his paper W.P. (G.) (40) 6D,that an increase in the Ministry of Supply allocation is required. I am not quite clear what this increase really amounts to. An increase of 6-7 million tons inthe annual requirement i.e., more than one-quarter of his original demands is extreme. It may be, however, that he is referring to the rate of importation.This is naturally very high on Ministry of Supply account during the remainder of the year, because owing to the way the programmes have been laid out, only7 million out of an allocation of 23-9 million have so far been delivered. Clearlythese figures require careful investigation.8. Five-sixths of the Ministry of Supply programme is covered by, three items,iron and steel and allied metals (including ores), 14-9 million tons; timber,6 - 5 million tons; and paper and paper-making materials, 3 million tons. In thelast war we reduced our timber imports from 11^ million tons to 1\ million tonsand cut our own forests. The reduction this time is not nearly so effective. If theuse of timber for unessential purposes at home were curtailed there should be room for considerable saving of tonnage on this item. In 1917-18 we onlyimported 590,000 tons of paper and pulp. Yet we seemed to get on quite well.Could not something be saved from, the 3 millions now demanded.9. The item which deserves most consideration is &apos;&apos; iron and steel and alliedproducts (including ores).&quot; For this the Minister of Supply gives a figure of14-9 million tons.^)In 1937, the peak year, less than 9 million tons of iron-ore and miscellaneousallied material produced, with our own home ores, 9f million tons of finished steel.Why then should 14-9 millions, less 1-5 millions for finished steel, i.e., 13-4millions, now be required to produce 9f millions the amount of steel allocated bythe Ministerial Priority Committee (11^ millions), less that ordered abroad.(&apos;) Even if this represents only the annual rate required ewer the next 7 months, it means,with the amount already brought in, a programme for the first year of war of nearly 12 million tons. /
10. The Ministry of Food, in order to meet the demand of the Ministry ofShipping, proposes to reduce imports by 10 per cent. Reduction is concentrated on a few items; animal feeding-stuffs are particularly severely hit. A paper bythe Ministry of Agriculture points out that the resultant slaughter of our animalpopulation would lead to a milk shortage and represent a severe inroad on ourhoof reserves. A general cut of 10 per cent, on all items, including wheat, would cause less disturbance to the national economy.It would seem (1) That the pessimistic estimates of our importing capacity do not squarewith the record hitherto achieved and the facts of our shipping situation.   In particular, the attribution of a loss of 25 to 30 per cent.to convoy delays is entirely unwarrantable.(2) That, nevertheless, the recommendation by the Lord Privy Seal that our programme of imports should be reviewed is sound.(3) That as a basis of comparison the figures of 1917-18 should be used.(4) That cuts in the programme of the Ministry of Food should be spreaduniformly and not concentrated on one or two items.(5) That the Ministry of Supply should explain why it has asked for somuch more at the very time when the revision of the War Officeestimates offers the prospect of reduction.w. s. c.February 29, 1940.
