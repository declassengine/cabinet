TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET.COPY NO.^^W.P.  (40 ) 75.WAR    CABINET.ACTION IN NORWEGIAN TERRITORIAL WATERS..Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues in accordance with.M.  (40) 52nd Conclusions, Minute 5 a further revised draft ofthe proposed Statement by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the stoppage of Traffic in Norwegian Territorial Waters.HeFOREIGN OFFICE,26th February, 1940

The recent incident in connexion with the AITMARKhas led His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom notonly to consider that incident in all its hearings hut alsoto review the position arising from the methods employed bythe German Government in the conduct of the war at sea.It is evident from the case of the ALTMARK thatGermany is claiming the right for her warships to utiliselong stretches of neutral waters as a protected means of access to or from the areas in which they carry out theirdepredations.      The use in this way of neutral waters whiohdo not form a normal route for shippings  with the soleobject of avoiding attack by the Allied Fleets,  cannot beregarded as an exercise of the right of &quot;innocent passage&quot;which is recognised by international law.His Majesty&apos;s Government could not acquiesce insuch an extension of the doctrine of &quot;innocent passage&quot;,which seems to them in contradiction both of the spirit ofthe relevant international provisions and also of the plainequities involved.      It would for instance permit a Germanship which was using such a protected corridor in a manner which did not technically constitute it a base of operations,to make short raids into the high seas to capture or sinkAllied merchant ships, returning thereafter to the shelterof territorial waters;    or to use this covered approach tothe open seas in order to pursue its ravages upon shipping,Allied and neutral alike..8uch a position would appear to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to be intolerable, and in their opinion neitherthe provisions of international law nor any reasonable view

of the issues involved would impose upon them the duty ofits acceptance.       Moreover, German insistence on theinviolability of neutral waters only applies when this isin their own interests, as is shown by the fact that theyhave not hesitated to destroy both British and neutral shipping in those waters.His Majesty&apos;s Government have felt bound toconsider the position not only from the point of view ofwhat has been said above but    also in the light of thegeneral conduct by the enemy of warfare on the high seas.In recent weeks the German campaign against themerchant shipping of all nations has been intensified andpursued with even greater brutality than before.      Thenumber of neutral ships destroyed by German action is nownearly 150,  and the number of neutral lives lost is over1,000,      These attacks have been carried out in almost every case in defiance of the recognised rules of war, frequentlyin circumstances of the greatest barbarity, and on many occasions without there being the slightest justification for interference of any sort with the ship.        Germany has announced, that she regards herself as entitled to destroyany neutral ship en route to any British port,  includingcontraband control harbours, and there have, moreover,  beena number of cases of vessels being destroyed on voyagesbetween two neutral ports, when the vessel had no intentionof touching at a British port at all. It is(

obvious that the German Government have now embarked on an indiscriminate campaign of destructionthroughout the waters in which their unnotified minesare laid or their submarines in a position to operate.While in recent weeks the greatest losses have fallen upon neutral shipping, British and Alliedvessels have also suffered from the adoption of thispolicy of destruction;    a new development of which isthe bombing from the air of British trawlers and fishing boats and the machine-gunning of their crews.The innocent character of fishing boats has beenuniversally recognised, but this has not preventedGermany from committing nearly 200 attacks on fishing vessels,  aimed at sinking them and murdering theircrews.     Even lightships, the object of which is toprotect shipping of all nations and which are by international usage treated as non-combatants, havebeen with their crews ruthlessly attacked by bombs.On the other hand,   the Allies have not onlysaved the lives of many innocent victims of theseGerman outrages, but they continually rescue fromthe sea German airmen and submarine crews who havebeen guilty of the inhumanities in question,.Prom the earliest times, it has been recognised that neutrals in time of war have theright to sail the seas and engage in trade with eachother and to trade with belligerents,  subject to thoserights of control recognised by international laweGermany is denying these rights to neutrals by sinkingtheir ships without warning and machine-gunning theirseamen for the purpose of damaging Allied trade.Germany is,  in fact,  seeking by methods whollyillegal and cruelly inhumane, including the murder of

neutral seamen, to prevent any ships reaching theAllied countries and to deter neutral seamen by fearof death from engaging in lawful trade with thermAt the same time , Germany is obtaining the benefitof the protection accorded to ships in neutralterritorial waters.      In other words, Germany isflagrantly violating neutral rights in order to damage the Allied countries, while insisting uponthe strictest observance of rules of neutralitywhenever such observance would provide some advantage to herself.International law has always recognised the right of the belligerent when its enemy hassystematically resorted to illegal practices to take action appropriate to the situation created by theillegalities of the enemy.     Such action, even though not lawful in other circumstances,  is made and recognised as lawful in view of the other belligerentviolation of law.     His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom therefore hold themselves entitled totake such action as they may deem appropriate to thepresent circumstances, not excluding the preventionof the continued use by the enemy of stretches of territorial waters which are clearly of particular value to him.     Needless to say no action that HisMajesty&apos;s Government may take will involve anydisregard of the obligations of humanity.
