THI9 document is the property of his britannic majestvs government&quot;TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy ol this document.cm.l4-0)78 (Also C.O.S.COPY NO,&apos;   Wjffi CABINET,EMPLOYMENT OF ALLIED LAND FORCES in scandinavia AND FINLAND.Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff CommitteesIt will be recalled that at the Meeting on the16th of February, 1940,s the War Cabinet took note ofa Report by the Chiefs of Staff on the employment ofAllied Land Forces in Scandinavia and Finland (W.P,(40)51).      In paragraph 10 of that Paper it was stated thata force of three divisions and one brigade of Britishtroops would be employed in Southern Sweden.     ^he Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff has pointed out - and we agree -that this statement needs clarification in order to obviate any possible chance of misunderstanding.It is true to say that we are preparing; three divisions and one brigade for operations in southern sweden, but whether we could put that number of troops into the country and maintain them there could only bedetermined after Staff conversations with Norway and sweden.     We should need to know what transportationfacilities will be placed at our disposal by the Norwegiansand the Swedes.     Moreover, enemy air action may imposeconsiderable restrictions on these facilities.In these circumstances, we think that we oannot be certain of maintaining initially in the South throughTrondheim, a force of more than two divisions.     AfterStaff conversations, it will be possible to calculatewhen and how further forces can be brought into actionthere as required.We think that the War Cabinet should be aware ofthe position as outlined above and that paragraph 10 of paper ?/.P.(40) 51 should be regarded as being modified to this extent.Richmond Terrace, g.w. 14(Signed) C.L.N.
