THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT g 1940 BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.    Q^Uj^It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET. COPY NO. PU-W.P.(kO) 80.WAR CABINET.STOPPAGE OF TRAFFIC IN NORWEGIAN TERRITORIAL^WATERS,Memorandum by the Chairman of the Oil Control Board.1 . In view of the observations35 of the Minister ofShipping, it seems desirable to furnish the War cabinet with fuller information about the effect on the oil supply situation of the prevention by the Norwegian Government offurther chartering of tankers to the Allies or the with-drawal of those now in Allied service.2. The Oil Control Board is at present engaged in a careful survey of the future petroleum requirements of theAllied Empires, the preliminary stage of which indicates a tanker requirement of 6JLdi ships.     There is, however, reasorto hope that a revision of these figures will indicate a considerably lower requirement, but the exact extent of this reduction cannot yet be forecast.3. The one and a half million tons of tanker tonnagereferred to by the Minister of Shipping is represented by 135 tankers.      It v/as felt, however, that even this number might not be forthcoming and our estimates are based on the assumption that 100 tankers would beprovided.3Zcirculated under cover of W.P.(i4-0) 76.

4. If we succeed in getting the 1GO Norwegian tankers,the total number, of tankers available to the Allies willbe 546-     We have at present only 82 Norwegian tankers inthe Allied service.5- It will be seen, therefore, that while we shall have difficulty in maintaining supplies even with 100 Norwegiantankers, those difficulties will be seriously increased ifwe fail to receive the 18 tankers still necessary to make up the total of 100, on which our estimates are based.     Asan indication of the extent of the loss of oil involved, a tanker, under present conditions of convoy, may be regardedas carrying 50,000 tons of oil in the course of a year.This gives a loss on 18 tankers of 900,000 tons and on 100tankers of 5 million tons of oil a year.6. Should&apos;the Norwegians decide, therefore, to remove from Allied service both the 18 we are expecting and the82 tankers we already have, it would be impossible &quot;to conserve and maintain adequate supplies of petroleum products&quot;.(Intd.)        G.L.ftos Department,28th February, 1940.
