Effect of the Russian-Finnish treaty on our Naval Situation.The main factors affecting our naval positionare contained in clauses 6 and 7 of the Treaty.      Underthese clauses Soviet citizens have obtained the right of free transit through Petsamo into Norway and back on theirSoviet passports, and to ensure this the Military situation of the petsamo area is reduced to negligible  proportions.2. Finland agrees to grant a right of way across her territory between Soviet Russia and Sweden by the shortestroute, for which purpose a new railway is to be built,possibly during 194-0, between Kandalaksha and Kemijarvy.This will connect directly the Northern end of the Gulf ofBothnia and the North-West corner of the White Sea.3. In effect, these clauses will enable the Russiansseverely to threaten the Northern area of Sweden and Norwayfor they can now move via Murmansk and Petsamo (ice-freeports) into Norway;    and across the new railway into sweden and on by rail to Narvik.U. It may be argued that the effect of the treaty will be to put Russia in a far more strong position vis-a-vis Germany,      But it would be folly to count on any violendisagreement between the two countries for that reason.With Germany and Russia continuing in a virtual alliance, amost dangerous situation may. arise from our point of view,5. Russia, by the Treaty, has put Finland much inthe same position as Ozecho-Slovakia after Munich, a softcore deprived of the hard rim.      In these circumstances afurther aggression by Russia may well take place, perhapsat no far distant date;    and Russian forces could soon be-moved to the Norwegian and Swedish frontiers.      It is evenpossible/^...

possible that Finland would offer no resistance.      In thesecircumstances even a demand by Russia for Norwegian Atlanticports, in particular Narvik, might have to be conceded byNorway.      Germany&apos;s price would be the fullest possiblesupply of ore from the North, and a &quot;sphere of influence&quot;,if nothing worse, in Southern Norway and Sweden.6. We should then face a situation where Germany and russia could base naval forces on Norwegian Atlantic andice-free ports, e.g, Narvik, Petsamo and Murmansk, and maintain and supply them without difficulty.      This is aposition which, from our naval point of view would face us with serious new commitments and would severely jeopardizethe success of our Northern Barrage scheme    and this position might arise sooner than we might expect.7. It appears impossible for us to acquiesce in a situation which may become so threatening to all our vital interests, and it appears to be one which can only be dealtwith if we concentrate even more determinedly on the earlydefeat of Germany.8. If we are to act at all we should act now when allis moving.     Even though we cannot proclaim that we are going to help Finland at this juncture, circumstances maysoon arise ?/hen we shall have to do so.     Moreover, we can at least take our stand on the principles of the Covenantand declare that we shall now take all steps to stop supplies from members of the League to the German aggressor, and asa start ^e^are going to Narvik,      This is dictated byordinary prudence in order to deter the almost certainaggression upon Norway and Sweden that may be expected fromRussia or/and Germany in the near future.
