But as a re-plyto this intensification of our blockade, she may intensify air action against our shipping,prohahly extended to the ports.Allied Precautionary andpounter measures.I. The War Cabinet^ have already agreed on the importance of forestalling this campaignwith a full and vigorousexplanation of the reasonsfor our action.II. We should take all possible measures to guard against this,  including special arrangements to ensure- the safety of our Last Coastconvojrs.    The fleet will haveto be disposed to meet any possible development of thesituation.as   S.W.C. 6th Meeting,, Resolutions (l) and (2)WoM. (40) 77th Conclusions, Minute 2(11).

Our Naval forces should notforcibly interfere with anyNorwegian attempt to sweepthe minefields.On the other hand, if the mines are swept up-, they should,be re-laid.IV.

Our force wouldthen probably be unable toland according to plan,  and .our action would be limitedto naval and. air attack.Later it might prove possibleto dislodge the Germans.9E   Foreign Office telegram No.50 to Oslo of 11.9.39.

impossible German Re-aptions.Germany will certainly &quot;bring       vi.Pressure to bear on sweden to increase the output of iron from Baltic ports, tomake herself independent of Narvik. If she fails toobtain Swedish co-operation,she miglit seize the Granges-burg area now, and theGalivare area as soon as the ice melts.It is possible that our action VII.in laying the minefields,combined with the Roj^alMarine operation mightconvince the Germans thatthey must seek a quickdecision by launching an offensive against GreatBritain or Prance,Allied Precautionary and&apos; counter measures.On the other hand, there is apossibility that the Norwegiansmay be cowed by German threats,orenraged by our actionover the minefield, into acquies-acquiescence with the German plan andhostility to our own.    In that event, none of the above landingsas at present contemplated could take place, and our countermeasures would be limitedto :-(i) Action of naval forces against german sea communications with Norway.(ii) Air action against German air bases in Southern Norway.(This would involve a changein our bombardment policy).(iii) Protecting our minefield.against German interference.(iv) Taking all possible steps toguard against the consequentgreatly intensified attackon our naval forces and shipping in the North Sea.There is no immediate actionwhich we can take to prevent theGermans occupying Southern Swecle-n.If they should do so, however, we-&apos;might be called, upon to go to theassistance of the Swedes. In that event, a force comparable to thatwhich was to have gone there underthe previous scheme would benecessary. The reconstitution ofsuch a force is being studied.We do not however believe thatGermany would invade Swedenexcept as a last resort,particularly as this would presentV.D with an opportunity of goingto Gallivr.ro. We therefore do notconsider   it would be justifiableat this stage seriously to weaken our capacity for dealing withcontingencies which are -probable(e. g, VII below) in order toguard against a contingency whichis clearly remote8Our plans are already prepared forsuch a contingency.    In the eventof the Germans invading the low countries our action would follow the lines laid down by the supreme war Council,   (6th Meeting,Resolution 8),

Allied Forces Required.3. The following are the forces required to enablethe above counter measures to be undertakens-Naval Forces,(a) Patrols for watching the minefields^ and fordealing with any seaborne expedition againstNorway.(b) Naval forces for escorting and covering the narvik force,(c) Cruisers and destroyers for transporting and. escorting the forces for Stavanger9 Bergenand Trondheim.Land Forces..(d) A brigade of 3 battalions and a Frenchcontingent for Narvik.(e) A force of 5 battalions for Southern Norwegianports.Air Forces.(f) No air forces need accompany the above Armyforces in the first instance.      &quot;STe mayshowever, have to despatch the air contingentwhich was included in the original Narvik plansif the opportunity to move to Galivareshould subsequently arise.      A decision onthis can be deferred.4. The general scope of the operations and of theproe^aEEie which we have in mind are sturjaarisod in theattached directive which, in anticipation of the approvalof the War Cabinet, we have issued to the Planning Staff,to enable tho necessary preparations to be put in hand at once0(Si-oiaed)     C.L,1?.
