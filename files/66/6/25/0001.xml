(40) 93., TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.COMPARISON OF BRITISH AND JAPANESE FLEETS.Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues the following note on British-Japanese-naval strengths which has been prepared by the Naval Staff.w. s. c.Admiralty, March 12, 1940.1. IN any comparison of what the Japanese actually have or may not have,the following points must be taken into consideration :  (a) Their capacity to complete 2 ships a year on occasion, as shown by thefact that they completed one battleship and two battle cruisers in1915 and two battleships in 1917.(b) That the whole of their capital ships were reconstructed between 1933and 1936, with the exception of the battle cruiser Hiyei, which wasdemilitarised, but has since been reconstructed, thus being completed in 1939.(c) As a result of reconstruction, the whole of the old Japanese Fleet has a speed at least equivalent to that of the Queen Elizabeth Class and considerably greater than that of the Royal Sovereign Class. Theelevation of all guns was increased during reconstruction.2. It would be unsatisfactory to include any ships in a Fleet which we send to the Far East which were not at least of equivalent speed to the Japanese andhad guns of an equal range. For this reason the 4 &quot; R &quot; Class battleships, withtheir low speed and the short range of their guns, are unsuitable for sending tothe Far East. As regards speed, the Malaya, Bar ham and Repulse are suitable,,but unsuitable as regards the range of their guns.3. The basis on which the calculations have always been made in the pastas regards the number of ships we can afford to send to the Far East is that acertain proportion of capital ships must always be retained in Home Waters.It is possible that, as long as we can count on the assistance of the French, itmight be considered that it would be sufficient to retain the 4 &quot; R &quot; Classbattleships in Home Waters and send the whole of the remainder of the fleet to the Far East.  On this basis the Fleet which we could send to the Far East in[20983]
1942 is shown in Appendix I, which also gives the strength of the JapaneseFleet by that date. The Japanese Fleet, which from all available information will be in being by 1942 is also shown in Appendix I, and at the bottom ofthis Appendix is shown the addition to the British and Japanese Fleets in theyears 1943 and 1944 on the ba.sis that the Japanese complete only one capital ship in the year 1944. This Appendix shows that the relative number of shipsavailable by ourselves and Japan will be as follows : (a) Great Britain. Japan.1942.       1943.       1944-       1942.        1943.        1944-15 16 18 14 15 16These figures, however, do not give an accurate picture of thesituation, as up to 1942 we shall only possess 2 ships with 16-inch guns,whilst the Japanese will possess 6 with 16-inch guns.(b) We have included in our numbers the Malaya, Barham and Repulse,the range of whose guns is such that they may not be able to get into action.(c) In addition to the Japanese capital ships enumerated above, there is every indication that the Japanese will possess 4 ships of the pocketbattleship type carrying either 6 or 9 12-inch guns. If, as seems probable, these ships will be sent out on the trade routes, it will benecessary to detach our battle cruisers from the Main Fleet in orderto deal with them.4. In Appendix II we have given a list showing the dates on which theships of the British and Japanese Fleets were originally completed andreconstructed.

Becent report states &quot;all modernised ships&apos; speed increased by 10 per cent.&quot; Thisprobably means speed has been increased from that when taken in hand for rnodern-isation, and ships are now thought to be capable of their original speed.3. Those ships for which the months of being taken in hand and completion of reconstruetioaare not given, took about two years to modernise.
