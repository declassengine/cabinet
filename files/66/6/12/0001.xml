1/WAR CABINET      V/ASSISTANCE TO TURKEYMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. At their meeting held on 31st October, 1939*, the War Cabinet had underdiscussion a memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence t, towhich was annexed a Report by the Chiefs of Staff on Assistance to Turkeyagainst German and/or Russian Aggression^.  The War Cabinet&quot; (i) took note of the report of the Chiefs of Staff,(ii) approved the recommendations contained in the memorandum by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence, which may be summarizedas follows:  (6) That the Chiefs of Staff should institute a detailed enquiry intothe administrative implications of despatching to and main-taining in Turkey the forces contemplated in paragraphs 18and 20 of their Report and should estimate the time that wouldelapse between the issue of the order for their despatch andtheir concentration in Turkey&quot;.2. In their Review of Military Policy in the Middle East$, which was approved by the War Cabinet on 15th January, 1940H, the Chiefs of staff stated:  &quot; 6. There are no Balkan Powers capable of offering serious resistance to Germany, except Turkey. . . . Not only have we given a formalguarantee to Greece and concluded a military convention with Turkey,but it would be a serious disadvantage to us if the Germans reached the Aegean or the Bosphorus.7. ..&quot;.. . We consider it essential that the Turks should be pressed todevelop to the utmost communications and aerodromes in Western Turkey,without which we shall never be able to give them adequate support&quot;.3. Examination of the problems involved has since been proceeding in theAllied Military Committee, in the Service Departments and by the threeCommanders-in-Chief in the Middle East in conjunction with General Weygandand Marshal Chakmak.* W.M.

British and French officers have reconnoitred in Thrace and Anatolia the bases, lines of communications and aerodromes allotted by the Turks for use bythe Anglo-French forces, and the magnitude of the administrative problem cannow be clearly seen.The air force is affected as well as the army, but I understand that further details are needed before estimates can be given for the work required on aerodromes. Meanwhile, the need for an early beginning on the work for thearmy, which is explained in the following paragraphs, has led me to put forwardmy proposals separately for decision.4. So far as the army is concerned, this problem may be summarized asfollows:  (a) The only existing practicable line of communications to the Turco Bulgarian frontier is that by rail and road from Istanbul to Edirne,supplemented by the road from Tekirdag to connect with the railway.(6) The Turks will be using this line of communication to maximumcapacity for the maintenance of their own forces in Thrace, and could therefore only allot to Anglo-French forces a very small proportionof its capacity. It would, however, be a very grave risk to rely on one congested and vulnerable railway and road in the face of probableair attack.(c) The Turks have, therefore, allotted for Anglo-French use ports in theDardanelles (Kilia and Gelibolu) and the road leading thence to. Edirne.(d) These ports have at present practically no facilities for disembarkationof stores and none at all for heavy loads or vehicles.The road is very narrow, it is no more than a muddy track inmany places, and no part of it would stand up to the heavy wearand tear of continuous military traffic. It requires remakingthroughout its length.(e) Until the necessary facilities have been provided at Kilia and Geiiboluand the road Kilia Gelibolu Edirne has been made, it is not possibleto maintain with safety any Anglo-French land forces in Thrace.(/) Work is impossible in Thrace during the winter, which extends from thebeginning of the rainy season in the autumn to March. The workwill take some 5 or 6 months to complete. Unless, therefore, it isstarted at once, the work will be interrupted by the winter and cannotbe completed before 1941.5. The expenditure involved is estimated very roughly by the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, as :   (a) Provision of piers and improvement of facilities at Kilia andGelibolu ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...       40,000(6) Construction of road Kilia-Edirne on the assumption thatthe Turks provide free labour...      .........      ... 160,000Cost of the plant and motor transport for the construe -tion of the road..................... 500,000(c) Provision of a pier at Tekirdag, if used as a temporary baseduring the completion of the work on (a) and (b) ...      ...       10,000Total   &apos;     ......      .........      ...   ^710,0006. As a result of a conference held at Cairo on nth February, 1940, attended by the three Commanders-in-Chief in the Middle East and by General Weygand,an agreed Report was drawn up and sent to Marshal Chakmak. This Reportpointed out the facts given in paragraphs 4 and 5 above. The Turkish GeneralStaff have accepted this Report as reasonable, but profess inability to find themoney required for developing the ports and constructing the road.
y. The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, emphasizes that, in order that wemay be able to assist Turkey in the defence of Thrace, it is absolutely essentialto improve communications. He has asked for authority to discuss this question with the Turks on the basis that they should provide the maximum assistance infree labour and material, etc., but that His Majesty&apos;s Government should beprepared to undertake the construction themselves. The next staff conversations with the Turks are due to take place at Ankara on 5th March, and the three british Commanders-in-Chief and General Weygand will be represented by their chief Staff Officers. The British representatives will leave Cairo on 2nd March.It is, therefore, desirable that General Wavell should receive instructions before that date.8. Eventually, it will be necessary to arrive at an agreement with the Frenchand the Turks on the proportion of the cost of these proposals to be borne by each.These negotiations will inevitably take time. If the commencement of the work is held up until the negotiations have been completed, the work cannot be finishedbefore 1941.conclusions . (a) The War Cabinet have agreed in principle that we should supportTurkey with forces adequate to prevent the Germans reaching the Bosphorus.(b) Reconnaissance and fuller examination of the problem have proved thatAnglo-French forces cannot with safety be maintained in Thrace without a line of communications additional to that from Istanbul to Edirne.(c) The development of this line of communications will cost approximately 710,000.(d) The work will take 5 or 6 months to complete. Unless it is put in handnow, it will be interrupted by the winter and cannot be completed before 1941.(e) The Turkish General Staff profess inability to find the money required.(/) Some guidance is required by the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, onthe line to be taken with the Turks at the staff conversations on 5th March.R e c om m e n d ati on s10. I, therefore, propose that the War Cabinet should : (a) Authorize the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, to agree with  theTurkish General Staff and General Weygand on a plan for thedevelopment of the communications from Kilia to Edirne on the basis that the Turks provide the maximum labour and material, etc., andthe work is carried out forthwith, construction being undertaken bythe British, and the incidence of cost being settled between the three governments concerned at a later date.(b) Invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to approach the Frenchand Turkish Governments and arrive at an agreement with them onthe proportion of cost to be borne by each.(c) Invite the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give interim approval to expenditure up to  710,000, so that the work may be startedforthwith.O.F.G.S.The War Office,1st March, 1940(B40/8)   60   3/40   w.o.p.   4761
