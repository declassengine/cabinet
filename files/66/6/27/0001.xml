,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTto be kept under lock and key.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of/this document.fi B.J3JR.JL T.fAlso Pa^er No. -lilfl MAROH^. .1940.COPY NO.&apos;Cim CABINET,WEEKLY RESUME OP TILS NAVAL,MILITARY AND AIR SITUATION.Rejoort bjr the Chiefs of Staff Committee-On the 19th February, 1940,  the war Cabinet agreed that,in future, the Chiefs of Staff weekly Resume of the Naval,Military and Air Situation should be prepared monthly, andnot weekly.2. This decision was reached on the grounds that:-(a) a saving in time of the Staffs would thereby be obtained.(b) a reduction in the number of reportsissued to Ministers was desirable.5, Since the above decision was taken we have given furtherconsideration to this question and we have reached the con-elusion that a monthly resume will add to and not reduce, thework of the Staffs, and it is not likely to prove satisfactory to Ministers.      The reasons are briefly as follows-4. A weekly resume creates little additional work becausethe whole organisation not only in the three Services, butthroughout other Government departments, for the production of intelligence and operational summaries is alreads^ on a weeklybasis, and the material is therefore readily available in asuitable form.     A monthly review on the contrary would, recuirethe consolidation of a large amount of material and would entailconsiderable additional work in its production.

5. A document containing a summary of events covering a period of one month must necessarily assume considerableproportions.      In such a form it will nots we suggest9 be suitable for Ministers who have little time to devote toits study.6. There are 5 however,, other objections to the submission of this document monthly.      Firstlys experienceof war has shown that it is desirable to collect anddisseminate intelligence and information in weekly periods.Operational and intelligence reports covering longer periodsare found to have little value9 except for record purposes.7. Secondlys as the War Cabinet are awares the circulation of the Chiefs of Staffs weekly resume was extended beyond the War Cabinet to the following;-(a) Ministers outside the &quot;War Cabinet.(b) Governors General and Prime Ministers inthe Dominions.(c) The United Kingdom representative to Eire.(d) Colonial Governors.Unless the resume is produced at least on a weeklybasis it will be of little values since the majority of itscontents will be out of date and will have been published inthe press.8.. For these reasons we submit that we should r evertto the original procedure and present the Resume of theNavals Military and Air Situation in weekly form.(Signed) C.L.N.
