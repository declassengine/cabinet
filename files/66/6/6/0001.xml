OBSERVATIONS BY THE MINISTER OP FOODolo      The effect on the food supplies of theUnited Kingdom of any cessation of supplies from norway would not he important.      The only foodwhich comes in any substantial volume from Norwayis fish, and while an interruption in the supplyof Norwegian fish might create some temporaryshortage,  this cannot he treated as a serious matter,,Moreover, there remains the possibility that theNorwegian fishing fleet might, at least in part,operate from United Kingdom ports,2o The treatment of the whale oil catch of next winter might be more important, but here allthat would be necessary would be to prevent thewhalers putting back into Norwegian ports thisSpringi    they should be induced to refit in theUnited Kingdom and to conduct any future operations from the United Kingdom.bo An interruption in supplies from sweden and the Baltic States would not react seriously uponfoodstuff supplies.      Exports from these countries are limited to relatively small quantities of bacon, butter and eggs, and no appreciable hardship to the UnitedKingdom would result from their total cessations4* An interruption of supplies from Denmarkwould be important.      It should be noted, however,  that

the present moment is exceptionally favourableif supplies are to be interrupted at any timein the comparatively near future, since &quot;bothstocks of butter and bacon and supplies from other sources are satisfactory,5- The United Kingdom draws largequantities of butter, bacon and eggs from Denraark0With the exception of eggs, these quantities arein process of being reduced from the normal pre-war totals.      An interruption of supplies wouldnots in the near future,    seriously disturb either a4-ozffl ration of bacon (the present ration of 8 02;is intended to be temporary) or the existing 4-c;s.ration of butter.      The import of Danish e ggswould be more serious, since somewhere of the orderof 20 per cent of the total egg supplies of thiscountry are being drawn from Denmark,6c The interruption of Danish suppliesof bacon and butter would force the United kingdom to rely to a greater extent upon Canada and Hollandin respect of bacon, and Australia, New Zealand,Argentina and Holland in respect of butter^      if at any stage supplies from Holland were to beinterrupted in addition to supplies from the scandinavian countries, our dependence on Empiresources of supply would be almost complete.      Thedifficulties to be met would be chiefly foreign exchange difficulties in respect of Canada, and shipping difficulties in respect of Australia andNew Zealand,,

7. The pnly other food imports from Denmarkof any importance are condensed milk and f ieiu     Solong as the condensed milk supply from Holland isuninterrupted, a cessation of the Danish supplies would he unimportant.     The absence of Danish inaddition to Norwegian fish, would in all probabilitylead to a definite scarcity of fish, which perhapscould, not be wholly relieved since the only alternative sources would be Newfoundland and IeelandeB* It should be noted that the interruption of danish exports to the United Kingdom would almost certainly result in a substantial increase in the delivery to Germany of butter, animal fats, meat, hidesand skins,  etc.      Even with a complete cessation ofDenmarkss overseas supplies of feedingstuffs and fertilisers, it would almost certainly take at leasttwelve to eighteen months for Danish supplies to Germanyto fall below their present level.     The Legation atCopenhagen say that their most sanguine estimate forthis period of increased supply is six months to ayear, but with the approach of Spring the Itmevfigure is too low at the present time.9* The following conclusions can thereforebe set forth:-(a) Over a short run, the interruption ofScandinavian supplies would not be seriousin view of the current stock position,(b) In the autumn; when we shall be more dependentupon Danish supplies of butter, increased imports of butter from the Empire may benecessary9     V/hether increased supplies will beavailable from Empire countries will dependentirely on the effect of weather conditionsupon the yield of milko-4-

(c) The cutting off of Denmark will increase our dependence upon Holland;    this presents,exchange hut no shipping difficulties,(d) Any shortfall in bacon can probablybe made good from Canada and/or from the balkan States,(e) Any shortfall in eggs can be made goodonly to a small extent from Balkan orother countries.ICs. If Scandinavian trade is to beInterrupted, and if it is considered possible thatthe trade from Holland may be interrupted by enemy action, the Ministry of Food would have to ask forcareful consideration to be given to certainadjustments in its Import Programme, as the supplies which would be lost are at present arriving in tonnage belonging mostly to the exporting countries.Ministry of Food,24th February,  1940,

OBSERVATIONS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THEBOARD OF TRADE.- 1.     Our imports from the four scandinavian countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland) for the quarter ended 31st December, 1939, were about 23,000,000 (out of  232,000,000 from all countries).The bulk of these imports belonged either(a)    To the food group, for example, bacon,butter, eggs, and fish, or(b)     To the raw materials group, controlled by the Ministry of Supplyf for example,iron ore, ferro-alloys,   non-ferrous metals, timber, wood pulp, and paper.As to these the Minister of Food and the Minister ofSupply will speak.2.     With regard to the remainder of the importsfrom Scandinavia, Britain would not be seriouslyinconvenienced even if she were deprived of them (our imports from the small Baltic States have already beenvery seriously curtailed).3.      Our exports to Norway, Sweden, Denmark and finland in the quarter ending 31st December, 1939,were about  12,000,000 (out of  102 million to allcountries) about  7-g- million being to Norway and Sweden.The main products in these export   figures were:-Ooal, coke and manufactured fuel ...  4,200,000Cotton yarns and manufactures ......  1,800,000Woollen yarns and manufactures .....  1,000,000Mo. ch xixox*y ******* * * e a ** 0**00-4* 00*0494 650 ?000Chemicals, drugs, etc...............     500,000together with a wide range of other manufacturedgoods.

. 4.      Even if,  for any reason, these exports were cut off, other export markets could, for the present,probably be found for most of them, except cotton goods.      Some of these markets would be more distant,and this fact, as well as the loss of Scandinavianshipping, would make a greater call upon our ownshipping.5.      The dependence of the Scandinavian countries on our coal would, of course, give us considerableleverage and would make them anxious to continue asmuch trade with us as possible, but the extent towhich we should succeed in cutting off supplies of sea-borne coal from Germany to Italy would enableGermany to spare more coal for Scandinavia,6.      In so far as the Minister of Supply may notbe able to make good, from other sources, the iron oreor timber of which we might be deprived in Scandinavia,then our general export trade, as well as therequirements of the fighting services, would suffer.of Trade,26th February, 1940.

OBSERVATIONS BY THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY.1.      A discussion of the effect of the stoppage ofimports from Scandinavia is contained in a paper by theMinister of Economic Warfare (W. p.(g)(39) 153).      since that paper was written, experience has shown that thedifficulty of obtaining alternative supplies from more distant sources will be greater than was expected;    thedemandfer many of these materials in other markets hasincreased, and shipping generally has become more difficult,2,      Swedish iron ore shipped from Narvik is one ofthe most important of our supplies from Scandinavia.    Thetotal arrivals of iron ore from all destinations havebeen gravely short in recent months.    Some blast &quot;furnacesare being damped down owing to the shortage.    Delay, there-fore,  in replacing Narvik ore by other ore is now more serious than it was. Substitutes for this ox^e are obtained but only with delay and only at increased prices.3,      If the Baltic-trade only is cut off, the mostserious effect on the Ministry of Supply will be in regardto paper and paper-making materials and timber.      the scandinavian countries have contrived to maintain a very substantial trade, amounting to some 100,000 tons a month,in paper and paper-making materials through the Baltic inrecent months, almost wholly in their own ships.    Toreplace these supplies from Canada,  even on a reduced scale,would impose a heavy strain on shipping quite apart from dollar considerations.    Limited supplies of timber havebeen coming from the Baltic but during the present famine ofnew supplies of timber these have been welcome, and it hasbeen hoped to increase them substantially in the summer,

4.     Other supplies from Scandinavia are less important in hulk, hut certainly not in character.Even if the Baltic were closed, we might hope toobtain some supplies of aluminium, zinc, ferro-alloys,special steels and calcium carbide from norwegian and Swedish ports on their Western coasts,.     Ifthese supplies were cut off, however, by the scandinavian countries, they could now be replacedonly with difficulty.     Aluminium is scarce everywhere,and it is doubtful if we could obtain increased supplies from any country within the next eighteen months, and then only by incurring capital expenditureon new plant.     We are hoping to obtain some 10,000tons of aluminium a year from Norway.     The Norwegianzinc has been ear-marked for Prance.      If it were cutoff Prance would no doubt ask us for help in replacingit.     We are expecting to obtain some 70,000 tons ofcalcium carbide a year in Norway.;    if we were to try to obtain this from Canada, the strain on shipping and dollars would again be increased.5*     A full appeciation   of this subject involvessome assumptions as to the desire of the scandinavian countries to trade with us at all.      If these countries were hostile our supplies of many important commodities would be very seriously reduced;    if theywere not hostile and still desired to trade with us,the effect on our supplies would be less serious, as,although Germany would no doubt prevent any tradethrough the Baltic, it would be possible to maintainsome U.K. imports through ports on the Atlantic and north Sea.-     I conclude, therefore, that from a Minis t^,/of Supply point of view absence of Scandinavian imports would be a serious matter, with inevitable consequences to armament production.-of Supply. ^ /February, 1940. \ i

OBSERVATIONS BY THE MINISTER OF SHIPPING.1.      It is assumed that any counterbalancingmeasures would be such as not to interrupt our ownsupplies of Swedish ore from Narvik,,2.      If this interruption is to occur, the Ministryof Shipping must have immediate notice so as to enablethem to arrange for supplies of ore from other sources,3.      The Departments concerned will no doubtcomment, so far as is necessary, upon the results tothem if other supplies from no way were discontinued.From the point of view of shipping, Norway (andespecially the ports in the South West)  is an ideallynear source of supply for pulp and other cargoes,,4S      The Ministry of Shipping is unable to judge the probable political consequences of retaliatory----action upon the shipping arrangement.    Even if it beassumed that the Norwegian shipowners,  collectively orindividually, v/ould abide by their bargain to give usls5O0,000 tons of tanker tonnage and at least 200,000tons of tramp tonnage, obligations with which theyare still far from having complied, the possibilitycannot be overlooked that the Norwegian government might requisition some of the ships or refuse licences to the United Kingdom,  or to France.    It is obviouslynot possible to forego any great part of this importantblock of tanker tonnage for long,5.      There must be some risk that some at anyrate of the Norwegian owners will take any opportunityof evading the shipping obligation if their Government-3.0-

does not put pressure on them, and as there may t)econsiderable risk that the Norwegian Government, inthe altered circumstance, would not apply suchpresst^e,  it is essential that we should be able and willing to exert at once sufficient means ofeconomic pressure upon the Norwegian Governmentto compel them (a) to refrain from any interferencewith the shipping arrangements, and (b) to seethat the arrangement is still carried out^Ministry of Shipping,86thFebruary,. 1940 s

OBSERVATIONS.....BY THE MINISTER OF ECONOMIC WARFARE.1.      Should the action proposed succeed in forcingall shipping using Norwegian territorial waters north of a fixed point to pass into  the open sea,  it should be possible to submit this shipping to  the control of contraband and enemy exports.2.      This would prevent exports of Swedish iron ore from Narvik reaching Germany;    also exports of norwegian iron ore, pyrites and other contraband.It would further enable us to control those ships atpresent evading the northern patrols.      In January18 vessels are known to have thus passed through our patrols, while in the first fortnight of February14 vessels did so,  apart from ships plying betweenNorwegian and Continental ports.3,      Our present Trade Agreements with sweden and Norway (initialled only in the latter case) require -these countries to place a limit upon their exports toGermany.      Under German pressure, following the actionit is proposed for us to take, both Norway and Swedenmight denounce the Agreements.      This would on the onehand have the advantage of enabling us eventually tocontrol their capacity to supply Germany by the adoptionof a rationing policy;    on the other hand,  the immediatesupplies which Germany might obtain from Sweden and norway, in view of the stocks which these countries haveaccumulated,  might for a short time increase,  supposingSweden and Norway to be ready to part with their stocks and products on the terms which Germany would be likelyand able to offer.      It is however unlikely that sweden and Norway would part with their stocks of imported materials.**. O

4.      Should, however,  Sweden and Norway resent,or he forced by Germany to resent our action,  to theextent of denying us all supplies from scandinavia and the Baltic, we should lose not the amounts wehave obtained from these countries in past years,or even the amounts which they have agreed to try and send us under war conditions:    we should losesuch actual seaborne cargoes as may otherwise succeed,in existing circumstances,  in escaping Germancontraband control, submarines and mines.5.     If Sweden and Norway do not resent our action to the extent of altering their trade policy towards us, we stand to lose such supplies as cannotbe delivered to us from Norwegian Atlantic ports.So many possible contingencies are involved that itis impossible to place a figure upon the weight ofgoods which would reach us under these conditionsfrom Sweden and the Baltic States.      It may beassumed, however, that Norwegian exports to thiscountry would not be seriously affected.i6.      The freight capacity of the railwaysjoining Sweden and Norway, excluding the Lulea-Narvikiron ore route, and also excluding the railway inthe extreme south of Scandinavia from Gothenburg toOslo, which, in the circumstances envisaged,  wouldnot be available for freight to Allied destinations,is probably at the rate of about 1-g- million tons perannum, though temporarily reduced by about 50 per cent,owing to the extreme winter conditions prevailing.This capacity is in addition to the normal passenger traffic ard takes into account the probablelimitations of rolling stock.

A K&apos;1 J7.     The extent to which this capacity might be utilised for the benefit of the Allies islikely also to depend on whether the action takenby Germany compels Sweden to utilise railway communications with Norway for her exports to neutral countries.     At any rate, the capacityavailable would not permit of the export of ourtimber requirements from Sweden,  in addition toother goods.     Our iron ore supplies from Swedenthrough Narvik would continue unaffected.8,.     In short, therefore, the many differentand unpredictable factors involved make it impossibleto state v/hat,  if any,  economic loss would be sustained by the Allies as a result of German counter-measures to our proposed action.nistry of Economic Warfare.26th  BplwiiaTOr     i oin
