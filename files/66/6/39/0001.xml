In order to seize again the initiative whichthey have lost, it is important that the two Governments, having learnt a lessonfrom recent events, should apply themselves without delay to draw from presentcircumstances all the possibilities of which an energetic and daring conduct ofthe war still allows them to take advantage.The French Government, for their part, have the honour to inform theBritish Government of the first conclusions to which such an examination hasled them. There is no need to emphasise the urgency of the decisions for whichthey call. Without any doubt the British Government have on their side evokedin their discussions the responsibilities which at the present moment fall on thosewho are directing the coalition and which forbid them to recoil from any of the positive decisions which the common safety of their countries, and of Europe,requires.2. The end of the Finnish resistance brings with it military and politicalresults which need be recalled but briefly.From the military point of view it frees Germany from the preoccupationswhich a possible Allied action in Scandinavia, and the necessity to meet it, mightinspire in her. It makes the Russian armed forces sooner or later available for future offensive or defensive action. It deprives us, for the time being, of the10947   [21033]SECRET.W.P. (40) 109.
spossibility of creating a new front, the establishment of which would have allowedus to draw the German forces into the open in order to engage them in that war of exhaustion of effectives and of stocks which the German Command isendeavouring to avoid. From the political point of view the Finnish defeatincreases the Russo-German supremacy over the Scandinavian countries. it again makes it possible for the CJ.S.S.R. to pursue her schemes in the Balkans,schemes against which Roumania may be tempted to guarantee herself by accepting the protection of Germany, and which at the same time will encourageBulgaria in her equivocal policy; it makes it more difficult for us to bring turkey to adopt an active attitude against the U.S.S.R., and finally it frees Italy fromthe principal obstacles in the way of an Italo-Russian rapprochement and whichmight have delayed to a certain extent too obvious an evolution on her part ina sense unfavourable to the Allies.3. These military and political results of the Finnish defeat are, however,less important than those which are apparent on the psychological and moralplane. There is indeed no one abroad who is not aware of the results which wewere justified in expecting from a prolongation of Finnish resistance, allowingour intervention to materialise in the north. The extent, which is now known,of our preparations for assistance has given an indication of the importance which we attached to this enterprise; to-day it emphasises its failure. Havingshown publicly that the cause of Finland was identified with our own, we arenow suffering the moral shock of the Finnish capitulation. All the interpreta-tions which enemy propaganda puts on our impotence to take a decision and actin time are weakening in those who are still sympathetic to us the expectation of our final success. The ground is thus made more fertile not only abroad, butalso*in our own public opinion, for all the efforts made by Germany to turn mindstowards a compromise peace.In a war the issue of which depends as much on moral as on material factors,this weakening of the confidence which we inspire brings with it immediate and lasting results, the seriousness of which must not be underestimated.4. From these first considerations there spring in the first place certainindications of a general nature : In the actual field of rction of the Allies and of their collaboration, a revisionof the methods of directing the war is certainly required, the procedure ofdiscussion, in the course of which the necessary speed of decision is lost, must be modified, conception, preparation and execution of our plans must be assured so asto develop in such circumstances that they no longer expose us to discomfituresto which abstention would have been preferable.In the field of the general conduct of the war, we should, moreover, submitour obligations towards third parties to a new examination inspired less by acertain juridical conception of neutrality than by the practical application whichthe neutrals wrongly make of the advantages of their privileged position. Thehigh cause itself which we are defending, the final success of which secretlyinterests all the small States, ought to strengthen us in a higher and moredictatorial conception of our action, and to inspire us to a general policy which,leaving aside the temporary conveniences and formal resistance of certain Powers,is in accordance with the common and lasting interests of the free peoples.Recent events have thrown a full light on the double use made of neutralitywhen it serves at the same time to paralyse our action of assistance to a Finlandwho had been attacked and to cover the pressure exercised, through sweden and Norway, by the Germano-Soviet collusion. The Allies cannot allow themselvesto be the victims of this ambiguous situation any longer; to do so is to forcethemselves, whatever happens, to pay respect to neutralities emptied of theirsubstance and of their moral justification, which the Reich for her part means to respect only in so far as she can benefit from them.It is, in fact, necessary to reply to the actual results of the Finnish defeat,as set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3 above, by restoring our position immediately and effectively by taking decisions sufficiently bold and prompt to compensatemorally and materially for the extent to which it has been weakened. Theproposals which follow are therefore inspired by this double necessity : to reviveconfidence in our determination and in our capacity to win, both abroad and inour own countries; to take the strategic initiatives which will assure us thepoints of vantage indispensable for the ultimate control of the war.
5. It is well to recall, first, that the general conduct of the war is, inpresent military circumstances, dominated by two fundamental problems: A physical problem : the exhaustion of the supplies drawn by the Reichfrom abroad, and the cutting off at the very source of her possible suppliesof iron ore and oil;A. psychological problem : the assertion in every sphere of our authority and our initiative with sufficient force to confirm all the neutrals in their belief in our victoiy and to inspire them as a result to turn both politically and economically towards us.If account is taken of these two leading princi des, the immediate steps which we must take as a result of the present situation can be outlined in thefollowing sense : 6. In the Scandinavian sphere and with ail due reserve as regards any possible further reactions which may result in the future from the presentsituation in Finland, the French Government consider that the Allies should proceed at once to take control of navigation in Norwegian, territorial waters.To the legal reasons which justified the decision taken last January on thissubject by the British Government there can be added to-day, not only the reasonsdrawn from the ulterior attitude of Norway in the incident of the AUmark, but all those which we can invoke as a result of the attitude adopted under german influence by the Scandinavian countries in the course of these last weeks towards their neighbour, Finland. Here the considerations set forth in paragraph- above find their full application. After having allowed Germany to abuse her neutrality in order to cover operations of naval warfare, Norway pleaded theobstacle to our providing assistance which arose out of this very neutrality, as a pretext to compel Finland to capitulate; in so doing she has lost all moral rightto oppose this fictitious neutrality to the measures which the requirements of our security demand that we shall take. Furthermore, the need to which attention was called in the English note of the 27th February for avoiding certain&apos;compiica-tions in the provision of our assistance to Finland has disappeared. The emotioncalled forth throughout the world by the attitude of the two scandinavian countries assures us, on the other hand, so long as its effect is not dissipated, of themost favourable conditions for this operation.The results of such a decision might surpass all expectations if its executionwere to include the occupation of vantage points on land indispensable to its full efficacy. It is not only our supremacy of the Northern seas which will be strengthened to prevent all communications from abroad and all supplies comingacross the Atlantic to the Reich of Swedish iron ore (sic). The actual reactions of Germany will in all probability set in motion the machinery of operations,the course of which should permit us to obtain control of the Scandinavian orefields and thus strike a decisive blow at the war economy of the Reich, whichmight hasten for us a victorious issue from the conflict. Conducted with speed and still profiting in part from the naval and military preparations which hadbeen made with a view to intervention in Finland, such an operation shouldrestore to us the moral and material advantage which we had counted on obtainingfrom the Finnish affair and should re-establish in our favour the situation whichhas been momentarily compromised.7. On the Black Sea and the Caspian an equally decisive operation is called for on the part of the Allies, not only in order to restrict the supply of petrol toGermany, but above all to paralyse the entire economy of the U.S.S.R. beforethe Reich can succeed in mobilising it to her advantage. The extreme fear ofsuch an operation felt by the Germans and Russians explains the steps whichthey have already taken and. are continuing to take to put this region so far aspossible in a state of defence. Their haste to proceed with preventive arrange-ments underlines the full importance of the time factor in the success of an offensive operation. It is essential, if we do not wish to find ourselves once moreforestalled, that an urgent decision of the Allied Governments should be followedby preparations and execution, in which delays would be reduced to a minimumby the continuous determination of all the responsible authorities.8. The absence of a state of war between the Allies and Russia will perhaps be considered by the British Government as a legal obstacle to this enterprise.
The French Government do not fail to recognise this obstacle. They, fortheir part, consider that we should not hesitate to set it aside, assuming, ifnecessary, the responsibility of a rupture with the U.S.S.R:Such an initiative has not hitherto seemed necessary as the procedure whidhwas foreseen for our assistance to Finland must have inevitably led to the contemplated rupture and thus freed us from the legal obstacles which thenon-belligerence of Russia put in the way of the extent of our intervention inother theatres of operation. To-day, now that this procedure is not availablefor us, the French Government are ready, if the British Government considerit necessary for the scheme of military action in Caucasia, to examine immediatelywith the Cabinet in London the best reason we could give to justify us in puttingan end to our diplomatic relations with a Government whose last acts ofbrigandage we condemn, and whose collusion with the German Government,every day more assured, we denounce.9. However speedily the preparations may be made, action in the Caucasuswill involve certain delays which will deprive us of the psychological shock whichis requisite for an immediate restoration of our moral position.Thus, the French Government suggest that, in the meantime, both in orderto obtain this first result and to set in motion the further development of our action, the possibility of sending French and British submarines into the black sea should be studied with all urgency. The interception of German sea-bornetrade between Batoum and the mouth of the Danube is as justifiable in that partof the world as in the Mediterranean or in the Atlantic; it should lead to thedrying up of the supply of Russian petrol to Germany by this route, and, ifthe traffic should be turned aside to Odessa, to provoking Russian reactions whichwould be such as to decide the open entry of the U.S.S.R. into the war. Thepresence in the waters of the Black Sea of Allied naval forces will also have themost salutary reactions in all the Balkans and the Near East.This operation seems all the more urgent and necessary to the French Govern-ment in that they have recently learned from a sure source that Russia is now engaged in assembling at Odessa a fleet of submarines which are sent in separateparts from Germany, thanks to which she would be able in 3 months&apos; time toprevent the access of the Allied fleets to the Black Sea. Here once again wecannot, without serious risk for all the future development of our activities inthe East, allow ourselves to be outstripped by the combined efforts of the Reichand of the U.S.S.R.10. At this possibly decisive moment of the war, the carefully consideredreflections and proposals which the French Government have the honour to submit to the attention of the British Government are, in their view, of capitalimportance. The French Government would like them to be examined in commonin a new spirit of realism and authority. To believe that time is working for usis to-day a mistake. ,We will only again assume control of the war if we are ableto forestall the initiatives of the enemy by imposing our own; if we are able to strike him where his balance is weak, without allowing him time to strengthenit, to refuse him the protection of the principles which he only invokes in orderto shield his own violations; to profit by all the advantages which we can derive from the supremacy of the seas and from certain dominant geographicalpositions; finally, to acquire for ourselves, by the strength and effectiveness of our action, the confidence and the respect of the States which only grant them to the strongest.PAUL REYNAUD.March 25, 1940.
